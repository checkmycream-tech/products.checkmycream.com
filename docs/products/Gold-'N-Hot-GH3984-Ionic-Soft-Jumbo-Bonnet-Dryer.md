<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Use with Velcro rollers to give my hair body and wave.  Use to have to use blow dryer to heat hair in rollers.  Now hands free to get makeup and other am task done while hair drying...has cut my getting ready time in half.</li>
    <li> It works very well for my thick hair</li>
    <li> My wife loved this gift</li>
    <li> I love love love this bonnet dryer soooo much more than the regular hood dryer. It&#x27;s more convenient because I&#x27;m not looking for a surface that&#x27;s just the right height in order for it to dry my whole head. I didn&#x27;t have any problems attaching and detaching the bonnet, it snaps on and off just fine.  My dryer also does not randomly cut off, and I have tried it on all the temperature and speed settings. I would definitely recommend this for conditioning treatments, and it even fit over my head with 40 CurlFormers in my hair! Absolutely perfect, it was $45 well spent!</li>
    <li> It is just ok. It took much longer to dry a roller set than my hooded dryer. I ended up sitting under the hooded dryer after 1.5 hours.</li>
    <li> This little dryer works like a champ. It gets nice and toasty and it comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer.  I actually use it only when I travel.  Because it&#x27;s so compact, it fits in my suitcase with no problem.  When you&#x27;re out of town and know that you&#x27;re going to swim or need to do your hair, this is the dryer!!</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer in 2010, and it just quit on me in spring of 2013. I used this dryer once a month to dry my locks after washing and retwisting. I appreciated the hot and cool settings. After you get used to looking like an alien with a puffy head, you will enjoy the range of motion that the hose gives you. Over all a good product, but I was disappointed that it only lasted for 3 years. Especially when I only used it once a month! For the $50 I paid for it, I did expect it to work longer (it no longer blows hot air).</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. I have thick natural hair and it&#x27;s a necessary item for my regimen. I love how wide the cap is. When the air starts going, the cap may slip a bit, but overall it does the job.</li>
    <li> I had a gold and hot hard bonnet hair dryer until the hood snapped off.  I bought the soft bonnet dryer last week and its been 100% better than the hard bonnet dryer, especially for rollersets.  Takes my hair about an hour and 15 min to dry (I have thick, coarse 4b hair).  Its much more versatile than the hard bonnet and much more efficient.  I also plan on using for deep conditioning sets.    I HIGHLY recommend this dryer and I love it so far!  Much better for your hair than blow frying or flat ironing!  Gold N Hot hair appliances are always top notch.</li>
    <li> It is a great product, my wife loves it. As always the service from Amazon is wonderful</li>
    <li> I used this hair dryer for the first time today and I love it! It dried my very thick hair in no time and gets very hot. In fact, I was able to dry my hair on cool and it was still very warm. I was so relaxed that I fell asleep. I have gone through countless hair dryers in the past few years (they just don&#x27;t seem to last), and this is one of the best. I was concerned about the bonnet because it didn&#x27;t seem like it would fit over my curlers, but it did. I just had to be very careful putting it on/taking off. From past experience with the attachment ring breaking, I will also be purchasing a replacement bonnet if I can find one.  UPDATE** The attachment ring on the bonnet has broken (why does this always happen to me?) after only four months and now I&#x27;ve had to tape the thing, which is not going to last. The dryer itself is still working properly, but now I need to see if I can purchase a new bonnet from somewhere. If anybody knows where I can get one I&#x27;d appreciate it.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT DRYER! EVERY BONNET DRYER I EVER HAD WAS TORN VERY EASILY AND CHEAPLY MADE. WELL MADE AND COMFORTABLE.[[ASIN:B002NGMENA Gold &#x27;N Hot GH3984 Ionic Soft Jumbo Bonnet Dryer]]</li>
    <li> Sleek compact bonnet hair dryer with good carrying handles.  Powerful drying capacity.  Would like more heat settings and slightly larger compartment to store the bonnet.  Overall performance is excellent!</li>
    <li> My sisters bought this for me for Christmas and I really like it! I have long, thick, wavy hair almost down to my waist that turns into huge frizz when I use a blow dryer. But going out in the cold after washing my hair is a pain, it takes a long time to dry. I sat with this dryer on and my hair came out great. Looks very shiny and it dried in half the time that it usually does.   The drawbacks that I can see so far is that the hose is pretty short so I knocked it off the vanity more than once. Also, the bonnet is huge and I think that&#x27;s a good thing. But you are not using rollers, keeping it on the front of your head can be a challenge.   Also, just an FYI, I contacted the company today to ask if they make a longer hose attachment and they stated they don&#x27;t make replacement parts for it - exact quote. Not sure if she meant accessories but that&#x27;s what she said. So I&#x27;m assuming that if something breaks, that&#x27;s probably too bad. That&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars, mostly the short hose.   Other than that, I&#x27;m thrilled to have a way to dry my hair that doesn&#x27;t make it 4 feet wide and frizzy.</li>
    <li> Have had this product for a year or more--still loving it.</li>
    <li> Great product!  It works really well for deep conditioning and drying my hair in record time.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for drying out hip boots, knee boots and snow boots.&lt;br /&gt;Also use for drying out camping gear like water containers.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where to begin, so here it goes I had the first Gold N Hot soft bonnet it&#x27;s white and it&#x27;s not as noisey as this one only thing the heat is a little stronger. The other thing is the bonnet is not as large as the previous one and the material is flimsey, easy to tear not as strong as the plastic on the previous model. I am torn I need a dryer can&#x27;t find the old model and don&#x27;t really like this one it&#x27;s too bulky can&#x27;t use for traveling.</li>
    <li> So far I like this dryer. Ive never owned a home dryer but I think it was worth the money.  It&#x27;ll save me time and money because I can do my deep conditioning treatments at home now I don&#x27;t have to do to the salon or use my hand dryer which is slow and tiring. The bonnet is big, but using the drawstring helps.  I used it on high and high heat,  it does get hot, but nothing worst than at the salon.  It can be a bit noisy, I had to turn my TV up fairly loud and use closed captioning.  But I also used my ear buds to listen to music or watch YouTube videos on my tablet.  The carrying case is so convenient.  Yes, this dryer is meant to be mobile, but you still have to sit somewhat still as to not put unnecessary strain on the bonnet or hose.</li>
    <li> I have crazy, coarse, super curly shoulder length hair that I can&#x27;t blowdry (even with a diffuser) because it gets super frizzy. I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out and as it gets longer, I find myself showing up to work with wetter and wetter hair. I was using my car&#x27;s AC on full blast to try to dry it some, but my commute is pretty short so it doesn&#x27;t make much of a dent. I don&#x27;t really do any styling, just a bit of gel and then air dry as my hair looks better the less I touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this bonnet dryer on the off-chance that it could dry my curls a little bit and not make them frizzy. It&#x27;s freakin&#x27; magic! All this week people have been asking me what I did to my hair and all I did was add using this dryer. I just towel dry my hair, add some gel (AG Re:coil), then I flip my hair upside down to facilitate getting it all into the bonnet, and turn it on high and hot. It gets about 10 minutes to work while I do my makeup and my hair is only slightly damp when I take it off. I do wish it was a little snugger on my head as it tends to slip a little bit, but it&#x27;s still such a great improvement. My hair actually looks like I styled it on purpose! I get some lift up top and my curls are loose and happy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for those looking at the Layla Ali dryer, I&#x27;m 99% sure this is the same one, it&#x27;s just not purple and this one is a smidge cheaper.</li>
    <li> Seemed like a decent product but it was too big for my mom.  It must be meant to use with curlers only. When they say jumbo, they mean it!</li>
    <li> Burned my forehead, got way too HOT!! Hot or Low  only...Hot will burn you, Low will take you a long time to dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Bonnet is shaped very strange, not like most bonnet dryers!!  If it had a Medium switch,  this maybe could be a little better, but I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this dryer to a friend because once they burn themselves like I did, they may not be my friend anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like the hair dryer. It is only 500watts but it is very powerful. I&#x27;m black and I have long thick hair and it is very adequate. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because the heat in the hose is so hot that it burns a bit. Also, the power cord could be longer. I have used the dryer about five times and it works great. I can dry my hair in less than an hour if I don&#x27;t use rollers. The hose stays attached to the bonnet. It is a little noisy but I am still able to watch tv while my hair is drying. All in all, I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Received as a gift for Christmas. This is THE dryer to have! Who knew a soft and moveable bonnet could make all the difference in the world?! I was so tired of the hard bonnet dryer I have because only 1 surface and 1 chair in my entire home lined up perfectly enough for me to sit under it properly. And of course it was the most uncomfortable combination in my house, which made it a pain to style my hair the way I like it best - a roller set. I can use this dryer while sitting on my couch watching TV or being on my laptop. Plus it dries my long, thick, super curly hair in twist rollers WAY quicker than my old Lazy Dazey hard bonnet. And it is portable, so in theory you could walk around with it as long as you are close enough to the plug. Definitely allows me to pick up something from the other side of the coffee table without having to detach myself from the dryer like previously.   Pros:   Works great; dries hair quickly  Allows for mobility  Cons:   None. No weird smell, and seems very durable.     Time to take the Lazy Dazey to Goodwill! :-)</li>
    <li> For the size and the price, it does the job. Perfect for traveling with little room to spare. Works so-so for doing heat wraps. The \\&quot;bag\\&quot;; however, does not stay in place very well. I have a long narrow shaped face/head so pulling the drawstring completely closed is not very sufficient and I have to hold hot gaps closed most of the time.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best soft bonnet dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It dries more quickly and evenly than anything else that I&#x27;ve tried (hard or soft bonnet) and it does actually seem to make my hair soft.  My hair is VERY thick, below shoulder-length, 4A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, and I suppose it&#x27;s a pretty big one, is that bonnet broke (the ring that attaches the air hose to the soft bonnet disconnected) only the second time that I used it with little or no tugging and it seems to be impossible to find a replacement part.  I can still connect the hose to the ring and then manually tuck it inside the soft bonnet, but of course the quality of the connection is compromised and it falls out with the slightest movement, which is incredibly annoying.  I attempted to contact the manufacturer, but the \\&quot;contact us\\&quot; part of their website errored out each time that I tried, and I gave up.</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time last week.  Using it isn&#x27;t that hard, and no, I don&#x27;t think it got too hot, but it took nearly an hour to dry my hair.  My hair is long, and I had it clipped into \\&quot;finger wave\\&quot; rollers.  But really, it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say I am impressed with the hood size, especially for my head with those huge clips on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use it again.</li>
    <li> The seller transaction was quick and courteous.  I am happy with the product for two reasons, one for portability and two because this product has the option to order a replacement bonnet.</li>
    <li> UPDATE August 28, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this dryer for less than a year, and have used it 20 times at most.  After just a few uses, the ring that holds the hose in place separated from the bonnet.  I&#x27;d be grateful for information about a replacement as I couldn&#x27;t find it on the Amazon site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue: there are only two settings, hot and cool.  The hot setting gets VERY hot--so hot it burns my ears and scalp.  I need to keep switching back and forth.  (The dryer also has high and low settings for air flow, but they don&#x27;t affect the heat.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently there&#x27;s no soft bonnet dryer that&#x27;s entirely satisfactory, and even though this sounds outrageous, I&#x27;d be willing to purchase a new one every year if I could be sure it worked satisfactorily and would dry my hair without issues.  Unfortunately this one doesn&#x27;t even do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m reducing my rating from 3-star to 1-star.&lt;br /&gt;AG&lt;br /&gt;+++++++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hair whose natural state alternates between frizz and loosely limp. I&#x27;ve been mistaken for la Folle de Chaillot; on bad hair days salesladies stiffen at my approach.  So I am willing to go to any length to have decent hair: smooth with a bit of body.  For me that means jumbo rollers and an hour under a soft bonnet hairdryer.  For years I relied on an old Sunbeam.  The model I had came with a strap that held it around the waist, making it possible to move around while using it.  When that gave up the ghost, I bought a Helen of Troy, and, later, a Hot Tools.  With each of these, the bonnet wore out long before the hairdryer.  For the last several years I&#x27;ve dried my hair with the end of the hose tucked inside the bonnet.  As noted elsewhere in the reviews, that doesn&#x27;t work very well, and it&#x27;s difficult to work at the computer, read, or do anything useful while drying one&#x27;s hair.  Last week I gave in and decided to try the Gold &#x27;n Hot. I was particularly impressed by the reviews that said the bonnet was large enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my amazement, I had trouble pulling the bonnet over my rollers.  I use four 2-3/4 inch rollers and six 2-1/2 inch--this creates perhaps a bit more volume than usual, but certainly not exaggerated.  The result is that there is very little room for the air to circulate.  What&#x27;s more, since the bonnet fits so tightly, it&#x27;s difficult to pull it off without dislodging the rollers, and difficult even to feel inside to determine whether the hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several reviews commented on the fragile connection between the hose and bonnet, and the difficulty in ordering a replacement bonnet.  To guard against ripping the bonnet, I decided to leave it connected.  (In fact, it seemed next to impossible to separate them without damaging one or the other, or both.)  But this solution is no better, because then the case can&#x27;t be closed. I will try to find a place to keep the case, slightly open, with the hood and hose still attached-- but of course then the case will not be protecting the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side: the ionic technology is gentle on the hair, and it does seem to dry well--that is, if one can only figure out how to tell when the hair is dry.</li>
    <li> I moved to Alaska a few months ago and you guessed it no salon for a woman with a weave.  I got this dryer when my hood dryer broke when being shipped and I can&#x27;t believe the difference.  This is simply amazing.  Its the best dryer I have ever used and gets your hair completely dry.  No uneven drying and no awkward set up.  I even sleep with it on! Its worth every penny and more :)</li>
    <li> I have a big head and if you are not weating BIG curlers, there is no way this bonnet will size down to stay on your head. I end up having to roll it up to create enough tension to keep it on my head. The adjustment is all in back and not big enough.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied n product was as expected...I have dreds so it dries my hair whn I wash n only 45 mins versus 2 days w/no dryer...pretty impressed...would recommend...</li>
    <li> Hot is too hot and only other option is cool.  Have to leave lid open to use.  Only has high and low speed.  I hate it and usually just air dry hair.  I should have returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice that everything fits in case.</li>
    <li> I searched for hours for a bonnet hair dryer and read lots of reviews before purchasing this one.  So far, it works very well and I&#x27;m happy with it.  I would recommend this hair dryer to anyone whose hair takes a long time to dry with a hand-held dryer and would rather spend the time doing something else while their hair is drying.  On the low setting, it is quiet enough that you would be able to watch TV without the volume blasting.</li>
    <li> Great product for six months and then the motor burned out.  I only used it about 30 times total during that time.  Very disappointed in the short time it took to break.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the hair dryer. It is the best one I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;It has a large bonnet for curlers. It dries my hair so much faster than a previous model I owned.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer last month. It&#x27;s very easy to set up and the instructions are clear. It dries my hair evenly every time. It also come in a t convenient carrying case.</li>
    <li> This is one neat little hair dryer. It is lightweight and folds down small making it convenient to have around. This soft bonnet dryer is much more convenient to have than its bulky hard bonnet predecessor. It provides sufficient heat to dry hair evenly and quickly. The small downside is that, like another reviewer noted, great care must be used when adjusting the delicate bonnet. Another tip that a previous reviewer shared is placing a towel around the nape of your neck. This device will blow uncomfortably hot air on your neck otherwise. The cord wraps up to fit snuggly inside the unit. It is a fair length, but I find it useful to keep a small extension cord with the unit to increase the distance it can be away from an outlet. All and all, I think this is a wonderful purchase. It allows me to get some work done on the computer while drying my hair hands free and with a bit of mobility.</li>
    <li> I know some people have felt it got too hot or not hot enough but I&#x27;ve had no issues with it in that regard. I have short, fine hair so that might help. Anyway, if you&#x27;re having issues with not hot enough be sure to tighten the bonnet with the strings at the nape of the neck. If it&#x27;s too hot, try toggling the heat switch from hot to cool. Meanwhile, it dries my hair. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I actually enjoy the soothing noise from the hair dryer but it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry very fast.  It took a long time and I found it difficult at times to keep on, it seems like it wanted to blow right off my head and I had to hold the top part and usually end up giving up and grabbing the hand held hair dryer to hurry up</li>
    <li> This is the very first bonnet dryer I&#x27;ve purchased. I&#x27;ve read reviews of other bonnet dryers and of course this one. This one seemed to have the better reviews. After receiving the product, I assembled the hose to the bonnet, opened the bonnet and placed it over my palm, plugged it in and turned the switch on the cool setting - to check that it works before I wash my hair. It worked! For less than 5 seconds! Turned it off and when it finally came back on, it worked again for less than 5 seconds! Needless to say, I&#x27;m returning the Gold &#x27;N Hot GH3984 Ionic Soft Jumbo Bonnet Dryer. Now, I&#x27;m a little hesitant to purchase another bonnet dryer :(</li>
    <li> not as hot and fast drying as i thought but i do have lots of hair...but good enough because i can comfortably watch a 2 hour movie while my hair is dried.</li>
    <li> This dryer works quickly and does a great job on my long, natural  hair.  I gave it 4 stars because the weak link is the bonnet, which will self-destruct long before the actual motor, but no replacement was available.  Thus, this second purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought the dryer for my wife and she used it for about six months. It worked great except that the bonnet and hose connection broke very early making useless. If that was not an issue the machine worked great.</li>
    <li> great product. pretty resilient.... i use it two or three times a week. it has a good heat output, not too hot not to cold. the hose is a bit short considering but its awesome. I keep it on my nightstand and dry my hair in bed as I do work or use the computer, its great to have hands free ability! Drys hair evenly even the back, sometimes i have to spin it so the hose hits my forehead so that the top of my head drys faster but its awesome. I recommend this to everyone!!! especially with medium to long hair!</li>
    <li> Compared to the traditional dryer that you sit under, the bonnet hair dryer does its job. It takes a little longer than the traditional dryer to dry my hair but, there will be no complaints because my neck doesn&#x27;t hurt while drying my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t tilt like the traditional dryer. I am overall happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I was very uncertain about buying this product but it turns out it&#x27;s well made and works perfectly!  The unit is travel worthy with a very nice carry case into which all parts fit nicely. There are two controls for heat and I like that. The amazon description of this item is completely correct. I have a large head and a very thick head of hair, I use very large rollers, and the bonnet does fit!!!  I know some reviewers said that the bonnet tears after a year&#x27;s usage or so, I can&#x27;t speak into that yet because I&#x27;ve only just got it and have used it only a few times. But I do like it very much.  It&#x27;s light-weight, easy to use, and does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Using this unit with the extra large bonnet has saved me about 40 minutes in drying time.</li>
    <li> I love this bonnet and  my hair dry&#x27;s so fast on the  lower heat setting. Haven&#x27;t  found it to burn  my neck like some have stated. Have medium length  hair.</li>
    <li> I love the light weight dryer and I love the versatility it affords. I can sit at a table and dry my hair or recline on the couch and watch TV.</li>
    <li> This was for my wife !  Just like the one she used in the 60&#x27;s &amp;#62; 70&#x27;s &amp;#62; and the 80&#x27;s !!!!!</li>
    <li> Love my girls night.  I roll my hair, sit under the dryer and paint my nails, read a book or watch tv. This gadget woks great.</li>
    <li> heats very quickly and the bonnet fits over large rollers nicely. only wish the cord and the hose were longer.</li>
    <li> My wife loves her dryer! She can dry her hair in half the time and work on the computer while doing it!</li>
    <li> I am writing this review as i sit under the dryer. I recommend this dryer just because it gets hot quickly, stays hot, and is quite portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;Large bonnet&lt;br /&gt;Long hose&lt;br /&gt;Pretty decent length power cord&lt;br /&gt;Gets hot and stays hot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The lid has to stay open while the dryer is on limiting where you can sit it, and I almost broke it off one day by accident.&lt;br /&gt;The hair in back get dried first and you have to spot chec the front.&lt;br /&gt;The hose gets really hot&lt;br /&gt;The bonnet is really large so if you plan on doing conditioning treatments you will have to jerryrig the bonnet to not fly off. I just gave up and bought a conditioning cap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many other reviewers state that their bonnet has ripped, or the hose clip has broken. Mine has not yet but i can easily see how that can happen. I try to take great care in not taking the bonnet off too fast and i try not to really move much when i am using the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good dryer for the cost and i hope it lasts foralong time</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what I expect a hair dryer to do. It dries fast and completely. I do not have to keep checking to see if my hair is dry. The bonnet fits perfectly and it does not get hard and stiff like my old one. I Love it.</li>
    <li> The very first time I used this dryer my boyfriend ran to me saying he smelled smoke.  Before we knew what was happening, the entire machine starting smoking from the center. The smoke alarm started. Thankfully, the machine died before it actually caught fully on fire! I had this attached to my head with rollers so it was difficult to remove quickly.  If it hadn&#x27;t died, my entire head would have been on fire! There would have been no way to remove it quickly enough. My hair was full of smoke. I&#x27;m still shocked at the cheap materials used to make this machine that allowed it to burned like cheap plastic during the first use! I&#x27;ve returned it and am awaiting a refund. I&#x27;ve never written a review before but needed to warn people about this machine. Buy at our own risk. Your life is in your hands!</li>
    <li> I return this item.  The cord melted from the heat.  Not reliable.  Parts thin plastic. Do not waste your money for this item.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer that I have used a few times now. I usually blow dry my hair with a comb attachment blow dryer then I sit under this dryer for 10-15 minutes to ensure that my hair is dry before I flat iron it out. I also use the dryer when using deep conditioning treatments.</li>
    <li> works well have had no problems .</li>
    <li> I had the Revlon Amber dryer and liked it but the bonnet got brittle and scratched my forehead so I  bought another one.  The new one was very loud and on the second day, the bonnet tore where the hose is supposed to go. Because the reviews were so poor, I thought I&#x27;d go with a dryer that had good reviews like this one.  I also noticed that there was a replacement bonnet so that if it got bad, all I had to do is replace the bonnet.  I usually wrap my hair and use the dryer while I lay on the couch and watch tv.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t do that with this dryer because the bonnet inflates real big and the only way to keep it on you head is to tie it under your chin, which is very uncomfortable.  Other dryer bonnets fit sort of like shower caps with the tension all around the cap.  Not this one.  It has some elastic on top then a drawstring on the bottom quarter of the bonnet.  It&#x27;s not a tight fit.  The box doesn&#x27;t show you a picture of that but if you look for the replacement bonnet you&#x27;ll see what it looks like.  Note that the model is wearing the bonnet without the dryer on.  With the dryer on it inflates and is really big.  My husband laughed at me for five minutes straight and well, so did I.  Anyway, as a dryer, it works just as well as any dryer.  It&#x27;s not that loud, but it comes in a case with a lid that has to remain open, which also limits where you can place it.   The material of the bonnet, although weird, is superior to that of the Revlon Amber.  For me, it&#x27;s not that great because I like to lie down on the couch and watch tv while I dry my hair.  I can&#x27;t do that with this dryer.  The bonnet is so uncomfortable that I may return it.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer from Sally&#x27;s after my hard hat dryer broke. This is my 1st soft bonnet and I must say, I love it. The cord reaches far enough for my to sit on my bed and surf the internet while I let my hair dry. It used to be such a task to go and sit under a chair to dry with the hooded one.   There are some flaws in the bonnet itself. It is very large, so it takes some moving around to adjust the drawstring and what not so that it fits your head and doesn&#x27;t blow hot air on your neck. I&#x27;ve found that drawing the string the tightest it can go and then tying the string around the chin to be the easiest way to go. I am glad the bonnet is so big though, so I can fit big rollers when I need to.  The flaws in the bonnet don&#x27;t take away from the convenience of this prodct. I usually spend an hour to an hour and a half to dry my bra strap length hair in rollers evenly. After 5 months, i love it!</li>
    <li> With lots of hair and winter approaching, this bonnet dryer should prove a nice luxury in dealing with a long drying process warmly. It does allow room for lots of large rollers for a very full head of hair, which has proved too much for classic dryer covers. Unfortunately, the hose does not have a very secure attachment to the bonnet. Slipping into a removable plastic ring in an unsupported hole in the flexible cap, it has come loose at times and will probably stretch out rather quickly making it impossible to secure. Also, the shoelace type tie string can only be tightened so much around the head, so when I do not wish to use the large rollers, it will not hold in place. Hopefully, I will find ways of fastening this better on both counts to enjoy the use of this for more than too short a time.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but this dryer is well worth the money.  It fufilled most of the things on my dryer wishlist: portable, small, can accomodate a rollerset on large rollers, able to sit comfortably while drying, quick dry time.  This accomplishes all but the last.  It does take about an hour and a half to dry my hair; but I do have super thick hair.  All in all, really doesn&#x27;t matter bc I&#x27;m able to relax comfortably reclined on the couch while drying. No more trying to sit ramrod straight like with other tabletop dryers.  It&#x27;s also pretty loud, so watching tv is pretty much out of the question.  I still have my older hardhat model just for protein treatments.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, go ahead and buy it!</li>
    <li> Really like it, i have thick hair and it does job.  However you do need to secure the bonnet tight on high, as it blows up like a giant balloon and will sail off your head.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my wife.She had been wanting a hard bonnet one but after reading the reviews here on that style(non spendy models) I decided to purchase this.She loves it,and says it helps alot.</li>
    <li> I have had this dryer for exactly one year.  I stopped it just now, as a matter of fact, to write this review.    Pros:    1.Convenience. I have very long and thick hair (locs) and on occasion I do my hair at home.  Please note: I&#x27;ve used this dryer no more than 10 times in the past year.  2. Fits all of my hair.     Cons:   1.The dryer gets louder and louder the more you use it.  It normally takes 3-4 hours to dry my hair completely and by the end of the 1st hour the  noise is unbearable.  I&#x27;ve given up watching tv  while drying my hair because I can&#x27;t hear it!  I read a book.  2. The hose gets hot so you have to use a towel or something to protect your skin.  3. The heat doesn&#x27;t carry through the whole cap, so the area of your head farthest away from the hose will take the longest to dry.  4. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, not like other GoldNHot products.  I bought this item because I thought it would get hot and stay hot!!  The heat decreases as it is used.    I&#x27;m now going to Google the customer service # for GoldNHot to see if there is a known defect with this unit and if I can get a warranty replacement.  I will not buy another and I do not recommend this to anyone who wants a product that will last beyond 10 uses/ 1 year.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to start rollersetting regularly, so instead of buying a 200$ bonnet dryer large enough to fit my rollers, I purchased this.  The heating can be inconsistent if you don&#x27;t use the \\&quot;High\\&quot; setting, and it&#x27;s super hot on high and hot.. so I&#x27;m not sure, but my hair looks great and healthy so I can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes a LONG time to dry, but I expected that with mid back natural 3c. :(</li>
    <li> My Senior Citizen Mom has always done her own hair and it is always a subject of many compliments for her. Her last hair dryer was one she used once or twice a week for a number of years, but she was always commenting on things about it she didn&#x27;t like (it was too slow, not hot enough, too loud; it \\&quot;traveled\\&quot; on the counter because it vibrated, etc.); finally it died. I checked around on AMAZON and decided to get her this one, thinking that it certainly sounded good and couldn&#x27;t be any worse than the one she had used for years. When it arrived my Mom looked it over and said \\&quot;I like the case\\&quot;; she then used it for the first time and said \\&quot;I like it\\&quot;.  She now tells me all the things she does like about this dryer (saves her time because it does get warm enough, it does work fast, it isn&#x27;t loud, it stays where she puts it, etc.; you get the picture).  So it was a GREAT purchase.</li>
    <li> Dries in short time, leaving hair silky and smooth. I use to have a hard bonnet dryer and wanted another one when it died but settled on this one due to the good reviews. It&#x27;s small so I can store (or take) it anywhere. Worried about how long the cap will last because the plastic is thinner then other soft bonnets, but otherwise I&#x27;m very happy with it and recommend it!</li>
    <li> This was my first @ home hair dryer, ever. I decided that i was no longer going to waste money in a hair salon on getting a simple roller and dryer. In essence, this dryer paid for itsself upon first use.&lt;br /&gt;I heavily researched which dryer i wanted to buy. I sought out another model by gold n hot -but it became discontinued from one day to the next. I bought this dryer at a local beauty supply store for $40.00 and i do not regret it.&lt;br /&gt;For 500 watts, this dryer gets the overall job done. I have long hair extensions and use  20 large gray salon rollers to set my hair. 1-1.5 hours under this bonnet, my hair is as soft and dry as it would be in under the salon professional dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy not having to plan my week around figuring what time of the day/week i can go to the salon and not have to spend a good part of the day there. I also enjoy the 1-1.5 hrs i have to dedicate to doing NOTHING while i wait (maybe ill polish my nails while watching tv :)&lt;br /&gt;The bonnet is big enough to accomodate large rollers. There is only 2 heat settings, hot or cool /high or low. Setting the dryer on high/hot gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;One concern i had upon first use, was that the hose attached to the back of the bonnet. I was skeptical about the hair drying evenly around my head- but it did !&lt;br /&gt;The product itsself is not as confining as the hood/tabletop dryer. If you want to move around, you have the freedom to do so; just as long as you have an extension cord and dont mind carrying a lunchbox type of thing around your house. (the dryer has a handle:)&lt;br /&gt;I have only had this dryer for a few months, and have had no real issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;I hope i am not as unforunate as other reviewers and have it die or breakdown on me.</li>
    <li> If you need a good one this is it!.  It heats well.  Very light weight and compact.  Very good to take when traveling.  I have three girls-young ladies... We absolutely love it.  You will love it too.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and I dry my hair using rollers. And I&#x27;m so happy I found this hair dryer! Its dries my hair quick without drying it out or burning it. And its so comfortable to wear. I usually sit in my living room watching tv. I recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Received as advertised. Fast Shipment. I&#x27;m pleased with the product. I just wish they would made a longer cord for plug in. An extension cord would work nicely, but that involves too many extra steps for me. Overall a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Great Seller with awesome items!!  Thank you!  :-)  this is so much easier than blowing my hair by hand.  i have arthritis so this is really nice to have.</li>
    <li> I bought this item after reviewing several online reviews of portable hair dryers.  I usually use at least some rollers, so based on others&#x27; experiences, I went with this one.  Overall I like the dryer a lot - easy to use, bonnet with sufficient room for rollers.  My only complaint is that it only has 2 settings: hot and cool, and the hot can get VERY hot -untolerable for me. The cool isn&#x27;t warm enough to  dry my hair very quickly.  So I end up alternating between the 2.  I would like a medium setting or a temperature dial feature (but I guess that might make it a more expensive, professional quality dryer then).</li>
    <li> This bonnet is big enough for the jumbo hair rollers. It is fast. The hooded dryers were fine.  They just kept breaking.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer about 2 weeks ago, and I love it so far!!!! I have used it twice. The air circulates well around the dryer. I used huge rollers for my long hair (middle of the back) and it dried within 1 hour. It gets extremely hot so make sure you turn on a fan while drying your hair. The dryer is very light and compact it allows me to work comfortably at the computer while my hair dries.</li>
    <li> I love this gold N Hot as a deep conditioning tool, I wear my hair natural and rarely need a hair dryer. Its comfortable, has two setting and it gets the job done without being annoyingly loud.</li>
    <li> I loved this hair dryer for about the first 6 weeks I owned it.  Then, the plastic on the bonnet started to rip around the elastic.  Then the hose came off the bonnet altogether.  Not made very well, although the motor still works fine.  So, having been through this before with another hair dryer, I used electrical tape to try and hold the hose to the bonnet.  It didn&#x27;t work very well.  I was constantly having to replace the tape.  SO, what I finally did and its working fine now is this:  I went and bought some duct tape made specifically to be used where there will be heat.  It&#x27;s made by 3M and it&#x27;s working just fine.  I say this for anybody else who bought this hair dryer and knows what I&#x27;m talking about.  It&#x27;s an easy fix although I still think the unit should be made better.  I do not, however, recommend buying this unit because the buyer shouldn&#x27;t have to \\&quot;fix it\\&quot; in order for it to work properly.</li>
    <li> This worked 6 times before the hose broke from the ring and the ring is still attached to the bonnet.  it does not work anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It was a Christmas present for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Great dryer.  My first experience with this type of hair dryer, and I love it!</li>
    <li> I have recently purchase a Gold &#x27;N Hot GH3984 Ionic Soft Jumbo Bonnet Dryer from Amazon and I must say I am IN LOVE WITH IT. It works perfectly for me.  I have used it three times and each time I stayed in bed... once I watched tv while drying my hair and on the other occasions I was tired so fell asleep... woke up after 45 minutes and my hair was dried. I like to keep it on high, low heat. I am ordering another cap in case it needs to be replaced sometime in the future. I love the way its light weight, I like the color, Its compact, Its comfortable to use... I could go on and on.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this Soft Jumbo Bonnet Dryer!  It&#x27;s easy to use and adjust the heat/temp settings. The bonnet is large enough so that you can dry your hair if it&#x27;s roller set or tie the adjustable attached string and easily dry your twist set.  I&#x27;ve had this dryer for about 3 weeks now and have used it twice (both times for a twist set). Drying time is about 1 hour for me (Hot/high setting).  I just plug it in, sit on the couch and can watch TV, read a book, surf the web.  The hose does get pretty warm, but it&#x27;s versatile enough that you can position it where you want (and not feel the heat from it). I would recommend this to anyone who values being comfortable while drying their hair.</li>
    <li> I use this dryer for my customers who have dreads.  As a traveling stylist it&#x27;s proven to save me tons of time.  My clients aren&#x27;t under the dryer nearly as long and it dries their hair evenly in almost half the time.  With the hood being so large and adjustable it fits every clients had easily. A great purchase indeed. Would buy again and/or recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to get this hair dryer. now that I finally got it and I tried it today, and the results of my hair came out so good! I&#x27;m pleased to have purchase this it was worth the money. It&#x27;s like you can carry your hair dryer and take it to places or use it anywhere in the house. Now the only thing I noticed that I had a minor issue with was the cord to plug into the outlit not being long enough, you&#x27;re limited distance wise. It does get REALLY hot when you set on hot and stay under there for an hour so make sure you have a towel to wrap around your shoulders. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the Gold &#x27;N Hot hair dryer.  It is what I was looking for in a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> My old +35 yr old bonnet hair dryer died on me and I still use curlers. I found this bonnet style just what I was looking for and it does the job. My hair is thick and can dry very quickly.</li>
    <li> Thank you for taking back the hairdryer I did not like and sending me the one I love,  I will order any time from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer to use with my rollers. The bonnet is very large, with an adjustable elastic band around it, good size for large curlers. It comes in a handy case.  On the negative side:  A) After seeing its quality (cheap chinese plastic), I think at $55 it&#x27;s WAY overpriced.  B) It is a 500w hairdryer. A good professional hairdryer is usually between 1600-2000w.  C) Its biggest design flaw is that it&#x27;s impossible to keep the air hose attached to the bonnet, it keeps falling off, not only due to the pressure of the air. It doesn&#x27;t attach well to the bonnet, it&#x27;s falling off even when the hairdryer is turned off. Very annoying, you have to use a hair clip to keep it attached, risking tear of the bonnet.   Update: The motor burned and the hairdryer died after 8 months :(( This time, I bought a soft bonnet to use an an attachment to my regular hairdryer, and I&#x27;m very happy with it. If you aready have a hairdryer, save your money and buy an attachment instead.</li>
    <li> I enjoy sitting in the recliner and letting the dryer do all the work.  I use huge rollers and the bonnet fits perfectly. It&#x27;s a relaxing thirty minutes and who doesn&#x27;t need that</li>
    <li> I have only use this product once but I must say it is up to par. It gives off the same power as that of the professional beauty salon dryers. I have long hair and my hair on high dries in about 40 - 45 minutes. The bag fits losely over the large curlers which I was a bit nervous about as I didn&#x27;t want to tear the bag. It is easy to assembly and operate.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer.  I used it for a deep conditioning treatment this morning.  I love how quiet it is.  I can have it on the low setting and still be able to hear the television.  The hot setting is VERY hot, so I&#x27;ve been sticking to using the low setting.  And since I can hear the television on the low setting, it&#x27;s great to just veg out in front of the TV on a Sunday afternoon while getting my hair together for the week.  I hope this dryer never breaks as it&#x27;s a great addition to my hair regimen.!</li>
    <li> I am enjoying my hair dryer!! I remeber when I was little my mom own a Bonnet Dryer. I thought they was nice then and I really think they are nice today. They allow you to move around and is easy to travel with. They take no time to get hot and dry!! I am loving it.</li>
    <li> This product has been a great investment so far. I have had it since February and have used it about 10 times and it is holding up great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonnet is very large and I was able to fit medium sized hair rollers under it easily so I don&#x27;t think large would be a problem. It also ties pretty securely with the strings, I never have a problem with it riding up or down and it stays in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer gets very hot, which is a good thing, but low is also very comfortable as well. Sometimes low means barely blowing and almost cold, that is not the case with this product so the heating options should be good for just about anyone. There also is a hot or cool option as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs great, not too noisy, not too cumbersome. It also doesn&#x27;t take very long to dry, but of course that differs with everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also hadn&#x27;t had any problems with the hose and connecting to the bonnet. In some of the past reviews it seems people try to make this more portable than it is and that is what causes the stress on the hose. Granted these are more convenient than the big hooded dryer but you should still sit still. This dryer does give you more freedom to get more comfortable so you aren&#x27;t propped up in one position for an hour but you should still remain stationery. If you do that I can&#x27;t foresee any problems with the hose and the connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer has worked well for me and I highly recommend it. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I love this!  It has made a huge difference with my hair.  However the product is not assembled very well,  the two drawbacks were:&lt;br /&gt;1. The glue holding the hose to the hose coupling gave out after a few uses. I had to ram the hose into the coupling and I&#x27;ve had no issues since then&lt;br /&gt;2. The bonnet coupling detached from the bonnet after a few uses.  I just stitched the coupling to the bonnet (gently!  if you rip the bonnet there is no coming back)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the issues above I use this product religiously.  I have very thick hair that holds water like a water magnet.</li>
    <li> My hair must be too thick. I used the dryer for two hours and still had wet hair. I suppose extremely thick or long hair will take quite a while to dry.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light and compact compared to a hood dryer.  I use it to dry my hair weaves after washing and avoiding an expensive trip to the salon.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with my choice. I wasn&#x27;t sure should I get this or a stand up dryer. I really like this because it allows me to be more versatile. I can sit on the couch and watch TV or at my desk and do homework.</li>
    <li> Used my hairdryer for the first time today, the 29th. LOVE IT! I have very long hair but it is super thin so I have to use small rollers. It dried perfectly and the heat was great. This for me, is so good that I didn&#x27;t realize how worn out my old one was. The bonnet was the perfect size for me too. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Freedom to do other things while drying your hair. I still use the curling iron but like the dryer to let me sit and read or do crosswords, etc., while drying my hair. Blow drying is tedious, air drying takes most of the day. I&#x27;ve had this for several weeks and it is working fine. I plan to order an extra bonnet.  Nov. 2011-- I bought a second dryer of this model. The first is still working well but I wanted a backup. Still a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Gold &#x27;N Hot GH3984 Ionic Soft Jumbo Bonnet Dryer..and love it. I have no regrets, best one out there by far.</li>
    <li> This was a scary experience for me. I&#x27;ve had hard bonnets before and I like them. This felt very heavy and awkward. I smelled burning so I ended up stopping the process. I&#x27;m sure it works fine for some people but when I smell burning...  while I have an alien-like cap on my head.. buh-bye! Sent this back.</li>
    <li> I was perfectly happy with the GH3984 Gold n Hot hair dryer I purchased in July 2013 until earlier this week, approximately 8 months. The cap nicely fit my big head whether I had curlers on or not.  High speed and low heat combination was the closest to perfection I could find.  (Bonnet dryers that blow cool or room temperature air are rarer than hens teeth.  The Daisy one I had that did this is no longer made.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad part is that the plastic ring connecting the hose to the bonnet came off.  Leaving a perfectly working blow dryer and a good condition hood with no tears or holes that can&#x27;t hold the hose. Unfortunately, the official Soft Jumbo Bonnet replacement part GHR8282A is not sold or even manufactured. The bonnet to hose connection is obviously a design flaw.  The heat eventually stretches the hole holding the plastic ring until it no longer fits..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is that the company offers to replace the whole unit if you have proof of purchase within the past year.  That solution seems to be extreme, like replacing a whole car if you have a flat tire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping the Gold N&#x27; Hot Professional Jet Bonnet Dryer Attachment GH9477 works as a suitable hood replacement.  Otherwise, back to hair dryer shopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like your purchases to last a few years, this product may not be for you.</li>
    <li> Gold n Hot is a good brand name that i trust. I dare you to take this dryer away from me I dare you. I love the Bonnet hair dryer and this one is awesome. It has a pull out handle and the way the cord tubing and bonnet are stored in this dryer is great. This dryer is lightweight and good for traveling. And this dryer gets very hot.  I would recommend this to any and everyone. Its also cool because if you fall asleep the bonnet is soft. I dont even use a dryer anymore but i wont get rid of this one you cant make me.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit for my mother; the Conair version did not last very long. Worth the extra couple bucks</li>
    <li> In all fairness, I did not purchase this dryer from Amazon, but since the quality is so poor, I wanted as many people as possible to not make the same mistake I did when purchasing it.  Within the first few weeks of using it, the plastic piece that you attach the hose to in the hood came loose from the hood with no way to reattach it.  The hood is such thin plastic that any effort to sew it in would have split the plastic even more.  I called the company and they told me I would have to return the entire dryer to them (and pay the postage).  I tried to find a way to use it anyway - even attempting to use duct tape to keep the hose attached to the bonnet.  Then the string that is used to tie the bonnet to your head also broke inside the bonnet with no way to retrieve it.  At this point I do not feel it is worth the cost of postage to get a dryer fixed that will simply break again.  I had read other reviews before I purchased the dryer with these same warnings but ignored them hoping it would work out better for me.  Be forewarned: this dryer is so junky, I do not believe it should even be sold, let alone purchased.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed this hair dryer as it seems to leave my hair nice and managable.  It does not get to&lt;br /&gt;hot like some of the hair dryers.</li>
    <li> This dryer gets really hot! It does the job but I have a few complaints. First, there is no medium setting - just hot and cold. On hot, yournears start to get too hot and you habe to adjust the cap continuously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the plug is average length which mean you have to face the case in a specific direction. The hose tjat goes into the cap needs to be longer too.I sit on the end ofumy couch and plug it in. Its the only place it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, the hot/cold switch doesn&#x27;t easily move back and forth.  I have no idea why this doesn&#x27;t work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get past all theae things then its a decent dryer.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this model.  The last one eventually overheated after 2 years of weekly use.  I did a lot of surfing and research on what else was available and decided this was still by far the best bet.  For $35 dollars, I got a lot of mileage on the first one.  The new one also works just fine.  One thing to be aware of, though,  is that the temperature settings say  &#x27;cool&#x27; and &#x27;hot&#x27;, but actually they are &#x27;warm&#x27; and &#x27;too hot&#x27;.  Unless I am sitting in a cold room, the &#x27;warm&#x27; (cool) setting delivers the perfect temperature.  If the room is cold, I need to keep switching to the &#x27;too hot&#x27; setting quite often and that can be an annoyance.  Also, the bonnet should be treated gently when hot because you may tear it when pulling the draw string.&lt;br /&gt;In the old days bonnet dryers were very tough and dependable and lasted for years trouble free.  But now, I think this is about as good as it gets.</li>
    <li> Yes it has 2 settings &amp;#34;high and low&amp;#34; but it should be air dry and room temperature. I don&#x27;t feel I got my moneys worth. I get a better deal when I get the antique  ones at a garage sale for a buck they work better.</li>
    <li> I had the previous version of this dryer for a number of years and then it died.  Because I had such a great experience, I decided to buy another one....and I didn&#x27;t read the reviews.  The hose simply does not stay attached to the bonnet therefore my hair doesn&#x27;t dry.  I reattach it about once every 3-4 mins and have to remain completely still.  If I even turn my head slightly it comes right off.  So annoyed.  I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> THE BEST. My other bonnet dryer from another company was dreadful. The hose kept falling out of the bonnet. This one is amazing. It dries thoroughly without burning the ends of my hair (tucked under the rollers). When using the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting you do not feel the heat at all. Again - THE BEST.</li>
    <li> This product is a piece of crap.  The plastic ring for the hose does not stay on the cap,  you have to constantly tape it to the cap</li>
    <li> This has been a mainstay in my weekly hair regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--I love the size and compactness of the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;--The heat setting are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem&lt;br /&gt;--Over time (about a year), the hose would no longer attach (click in) to the bonnet making the item useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did not give up on it and got some super glue (which stands up to the heat). The super glue worked perfectly, however, now I can no longer neatly fold and store it away - just a minor trade off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that I did not contact the manufacturer about the defect. Though I&#x27;ll consider doing that just to make them aware of the problem.</li>
    <li> this is a very good hair dryer.  it gets hot but not too hot.  if you have thick hair in rollers, expect to be wearing the bonnet for a while. All in all, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I do my deep conditioning treatments with this bonnet dryer (which I discovered because of Alicia James on YT), and let me tell you... I could see the difference in the health of my hair after just a month. It secures easily with the ties and has (low/high) (hot/cool) settings. I like to relax in bed and watch YT vids as I deep condition with it. The bonnet itself is very large so you can fit jumbo rollers underneath it if necessary. It&#x27;s easy to store away and does it&#x27;s job well. It was a good investment, and a much cheaper one than a hair steamer from what I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con i&#x27;ve experienced from this product is having my boyfriend joke about me being an alien while i use it lol.</li>
    <li> I have had this item for months and I love it.  It is light and compact.  It is also impossible to lose any of the parts, because everything is attached or has a compartment. Its heats up quickly.  I would recommend this tool.</li>
    <li> I bought  Gold &#x27;N Hot GH3984 Ionic Soft Jumbo Bonnet Dryer. but its broken when i used it first time I only used it about 30 times total during that time.Would you accept a free exchange?or give me a refund?</li>
    <li> This hair dryer worked for several months, but then the ring that holds the hose to the bonnet came unattached from the bonnet.There is no way I can use the dryer without the hose attached to the bonnet. China is making a product with a major flaw; please consider before you buy.&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer on this site suggests a solution: repair the ring in the bonnet with heat resistant duct tape. If that does not work, I&#x27;ll have to throw the dryer away. The motor works well.</li>
    <li> I like that its not bulky and easy to take on trips.  I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Finally! A hair dryer that is hot, fits all of my hair and curlers, AND...it doesn&#x27;t sound like a squealing, dying animal when you turn it on! The moderate hum is much more manageable than my last Carel dryer! Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I was excited to find this gem. It gets extremely hot and cuts down on my drying time. The cap it soft and comfortable and allows me to position myself in a way that&#x27;s comfratable to me. Shamelessly, I fall alseep in it with my head propped against my headboard and wake up ready to style. No complaints!</li>
    <li> Since I bought this dryer, I have not sat under a hooded dryer for another second.  It is so much more comfortable.  Definitely glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> This was the first bonnet dryer I ever owned and it served it&#x27;s purpose well. I bought it about 8 years ago for about $50. It has very good heat output, nice long hose and cord. The plastic housing was an initial turnoff, but the performance of the dryer made that a non-issue. It performed very well until the tabs that attach the bonnet to the hose broke. The bonnet itself began to tear at the seams. After 8 years of service, these were minor issues that I chalked up to rigorous use. We certainly got our money&#x27;s worth out of it. the dryer still works, I just have to rig the bonnet to attach to the hose. However, I recently purchased another bonnet dryer just to check out a different, highly recommended product, not because the Gold N Hot wasn&#x27;t worth another try. I still keep the Gold N Hot as a backup. Besides the minor issues, it&#x27;s still in good working condition. Dries like it did the very first time. This is a good product, lasted me a long while and after 8 years, is still in my beauty arsenal.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer and it works great and you can take it anyway and just plug it. I use it for heat when I am deep conditioning my hair. It works great.</li>
    <li> I was not sure if this dryer would meet my expectation and it certainly did. I get the job done, not noisy as the Carel brand one that I had. Good size of the soft bonnet and hot setting works pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;One problem I got an invoice for about 75 can dollars and my credit card was charged 10 dollars more. Still do not know the reason.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> basic dryer.  But no other setting but hot and less hot.  Cool down before turning off.&lt;br /&gt;Bonnet is good large size.</li>
    <li> I use my hair dryer once a week for deep conditioning treatments. I love the  convenience and portability of the hair dryer. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Works great. I use this dryer about once a week with damp hair and 15 large plastic rollers. The bonnet is big enough to fit over my rollers - that was my major concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair dries in about 90 minutes on low. High is too hot for me. When I dried on high, I wrapped a scarf around the edge of the bonnet to prevent hot air from blowing on me. On high, my hair dries in about an hour. The case is nice. Everything fits inside for easy storage.</li>
    <li> Like it very much!!!!!!! Super customer service . Thanks so very much!! I hope it will last for years to come.</li>
    <li> cap wasn&#x27;t as big as I expected, but I kept the cap from last dryer, so it&#x27;s all good. Sturdy and lots of power.</li>
    <li> Have no idea who thought this dryer up, but, it is definitely not what I expected.  Called the company and they said nothing they could do.  The hood bonnet was so huge it just fell over the face had to have it adjusted myself so would not recommend it to anyone sorry.</li>
    <li> Love this product,  Very convenient.  Easy to carry. Does a great job drying your hair,  I have had this product for a month.</li>
    <li> Best hair tool I&#x27;ve bought so far. It&#x27;s so much more comfortable than the hooded dryers. Less heat blowing in my face. I can move around or lay down while my hair is drying. I luv it soooo much wish I had this years ago. Great for summer time hair drying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for years.  It&#x27;s easy to pack so it has been on many vacations.  I am usually painting my toes or on the computer or laying down with it so it is very convenient.</li>
    <li> Something for my daugter she wanted it and i guess LOVES using it i&#x27;m a guy and what do i know about a Woman&#x27;s hair.... that it does look good after the time spent using the product.</li>
    <li> It was OK. Didn&#x27;t dry fast like I thought.  I did read the direction.  If you have any ideal how to get it to dry fast.  Pl applied</li>
    <li> I use my hair dryer on a regular basis.  Has never failed and it provides a more than adequate amount hot air.  The only issue for me is, the jumbo bonnet is far too large for head and hair.  Wish I could find a replacement a size smaller than jumbo.</li>
    <li> i started smoking when i went to use it for the first time and when i tried to try it again it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Sally&#x27;s because I needed a dryer right away.  I own the baby bliss hard-hat ionic dryer which is good and I have no complaints but bought this one for convience. My hair dried very soft and moisturized.  It felt much more moisturized then using the hard hat.  I used the gray plastic rollers and it fit just fine.  It&#x27;s a bit of a pain to first put it on and not loosen your rollers so practice to get that bonnet on right.  I also recommend that you gently practice how to pull the lace to tighten the hat before you put it on.  You need to pull each side at the same time.  I pulled each side alone and accidently ripped a bit of the hat.  I love this dryer and its well work the money.</li>
    <li> This dryer is perfect for me because it dries my hair well even on the low setting (4b and loc&#x27;d), it&#x27;s compact, and I can use it in bed which is perfect for me because I tend to get sleepy while under the dryer.  I&#x27;m much happier with this than the hooded style dryer that I had before!  No more having to pull out the bulky dryer, set it up with books to keep it from tipping over then sitting on the floor or at the kitchen table until dried :(</li>
    <li> The bonnet is wide enough to cover my locks.  I have no problems using it.  You have to handle it with care.</li>
    <li> I have tried other bonnet type hair dryers &amp; the level of the heat on this unit was much better.</li>
    <li> This product works just like a regular salon dryer, just with a bonnet, and gets really hot, and the price you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
    <li> I have only used it twice but the prduct works pretty well, the hood is a little weird, im still getting used to it, i thing its a weird shape, makign it feel small. It also gets very hot but has a cool setting too.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair. It usually takes me about 2-3 hours to dry my hair at home. This dryer has has cut my drying time down by at least an hour.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been rolling my hair since the 70&#x27;s,  The table top hood dryers are nice but I like having the option of taking this on trips and it fits in my suitcase.  Works well with big rollers.</li>
    <li> The hose between the unit and the headpiece could be longer... otherwise you need to be sitting right on top of it.</li>
    <li> Great Hair Dryer.  You can read, sleep etc. while drying hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Gold &#x27;N Hot Jumbo Bonnet Dryer.  It is very easy to use.  I would definitely recommend this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and it takes less time to put it in rollers and sit under this dryer. I can work or read and not spend double the time a blow dryer takes to dry my hair. It is noisy but all bonnet dryers are.</li>
    <li> The dryer did not heat as well as I expected.  I had to keep adjusting it in order for it to cover my hair.  In other words, the bonnet was so big that the heat was far from my hair, so I had to keep pushing the bonnet down close to my hair in order for it to dry.</li>
    <li> I prefer to do my hair myself. I have long locks. I bought this product after my hard hooded dryer broke (for the 3rd time). This dryer alloted me the freedom to do other things. The bonnett was large enough to fit around my big curlers. Be prepared to place a towel on your neck as I had to. The vent of the bonnett is towards the edge of the bonnett, which blew hot air on my neck. I spent the same amount of time drying my hair as I would have with the hooded dryer. In fact, it maybe less considering my hair dried evenly and I did not have to spend extra time trying to dry the back.  I highly recommend this product to others, especially those tired of propping the hooded drying on the table, adjusting the height or adding weight to the base to prevent it from tipping over.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use when I color my hair. Waste of money.  The way the bonnet is constructed, it does not get hot enough in front top, where I need it most. Purchased after reading the reviews, and I am really disappointed. Money down the drain.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! No need to go to the hairdresser. I would recommend this product. Every home should have one of these</li>
    <li> bought this about a year ago and it works great it gets reaaly hot .....the strings is hard to keept thight when the hot air starts to blow, but ijust double tie it around my head and that helps</li>
    <li> My first soft dryer and it works well. It is a good portable dryer, easy storage. Does not blow better than a conair. The string that keeps the cap on is a little annoying but other than that it&#x27;s cool enough.</li>
    <li> The dryer is working out well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE,LOVE my dryer!!! It has a draw-string, you can use it will big/small rollers or for a deep conditioning treatment. This baby get HOOOTTT too, which you can feel all over your head. The motor is not annoying either, you can hear what&#x27;s going on. I will order another one when mine finally dies. I haven&#x27;t had any problems thus far. It was a great price too.</li>
    <li> I needed this type of dryer for use with velcro rollers.  I read several reviews of different bonnet/hood dryers.  Although there were a few lower reviews on this one, it mostly got good reviews.  I have been pleased.  The bonnet is large enough to fit over large rollers and does exactly what I need.  My hair is only shoulder length and of medium thickness with some layers so it can dry in 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer in April. I really enjoyed it and didn&#x27;t have any problems until today. I probably haven&#x27;t even used the dryer 10 times, and after overheating a few times and cutting off and on, it has finally died all together. Not very happy about this and will be trying to see what can be done about it. It definitely should last longer than this;</li>
    <li> Awesome dryer. It dries my hair quick &amp;evenly. Feels like I just walked out of a salon after every use. Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> The bonnet lifts off your head on hi heat. I have to tied it under my chin to keep it down on cool heat. Very disappointing, I really wanted to like the dryer</li>
    <li> I use it to dry my locs and it works just fine. The hose doesn&#x27;t slip out but gets real hot on my back. I use my shirt or towel to protect my skin. I don&#x27;t anticipate it breaking any time soon.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product.  It is convenient and is great to travel with.</li>
    <li> The dryer is compact and easy to assemble. My hair is short and it dried my hair in 45mins verses sitting under a regular headset for an hour and a half. I would recommend this product to anyone in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> The plastic air cable MELTED two months into using this product, which would make this my SECOND time purchasing a Bonnet Dryer. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.....</li>
    <li> Love this dryer.  I like using a bonnet type dryer as I can do other things while my hair is drying.  I have had a few other dryers &amp; the bonnets were thin &amp; ripped very easily.  This bonnet is really nice and is connected very well.  The housing of this product is very well made.  The others I have had seemed cheap. The bonnet also fits over large roller easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a soft-bonnet hair dryer, and haven&#x27;t used one in 20+ years since my mom&#x27;s old GE soft-bonnet from the 1950-60&#x27;s. I decided to buy this one because I&#x27;m tired of flat-ironing/blowdrying my hair whenever I wear it straight....which is mostly during the wintertime only.    The stats on this dryer seemed to be the best fit for my needs--nice power levels and huge bonnet. I have thick, dense, 3b curly hair that&#x27;s mid-back length, so my rollers tend to be fairly large. After reading negative reviews about many of the hard-bonnet dryers being unable to accomodate a headful of jumbo rollers, I went ahead and got it.    BEST investment ever! This bonnet was able to accommodate a headful of ex-large (1.5-inch) and jumbo (1.75 inch) rollers, with room to spare. My roller-set dried in 1.5 hours on \\&quot;LOW\\&quot; heat....didn&#x27;t even bother using the \\&quot;HIGH\\&quot; setting! I switched the setting to \\&quot;Cool\\&quot; shortly before removing the bonnet to remove my rollers...I read somewhere that that&#x27;s recommended. This purchase is a great investment for me, since I can also do conditioning treatments on myself AND my little girl when needed. This is a great way to keep her hair healthy, as I can do braid-sets and twistouts on her hair (she&#x27;s 4a)    P.S. I&#x27;m not sure where people are getting the \\&quot;only 500 watts\\&quot; from. I read on the Sally website that this dryer is 1875 watts.</li>
    <li> bought this product and the dryer is not very strong, the bonnet is a pain to put on and slips off.....i used my own blowdryer and end up melting the hole where the dryer inserts, does not withstand heat very well. very dissappointed.  now i have a blowdryer that is not hot or warm and no bonnet to use it with</li>
    <li> The extra large bonnet fits my big head with my jumbo magnetic rollers in. Gets really hot. I like that I can sit on the couch or lay down now to sleep or watch a movie.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair and finally got disgusted with the way diffusers always left my curls looking blown out and frizzy.  I wanted my curls to look like I just came back from the salon.  They never used a blow dryer or diffuser on my hair, but instead have me sit under the bonnet dryer.  I thought something like that would be too expensive and too big for home use, but someone mentioned that they sold inexpensive portable bonnet dryers so I thought I would try it to see if I could get similar results.  When I saw the Gold&#x27;N Hot Ionic Soft Jumbo Bonnet Dryer I was happy to see it was so affordable so I bought it.  I was pleased to find it was even more compact and portable than I thought.  I&#x27;ve used it a half dozen times now and I really like the results.  Some reviews commented on the hands free convenience, but frankly unless you attach a shoulder strap to it you really can&#x27;t be very mobile.  The most you can do with it on is tweeze your eyebrows or put on makeup (and even that might me a little tricky).  Overall I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone with curly hair.</li>
    <li> UPDATED March 2014: I&#x27;ve owned the dryer for about 6 months now and love it. However, the bonnet recently ripped in several places. It no longer securely fits over my hair. The bonnet seemed heavy and well made when I bought it. I&#x27;ve treated it carefully with normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sept. 2013:  I just ordered this hairdryer. The bonnet is comfortable and tightens fine. The dryer did a great job on my hair. It has a hot and cool setting -- the hot setting is very hot and the cool setting is warm. The dryer and bonnet also have a solid, sturdy feel. So far I am very pleased. The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the dryer is inside a case and you can&#x27;t take it out of the case... so if you are using it on an uneven surface like a couch or bed, the case lid sometimes falls shut. I solved this problem by putting a hairbrush or remote control between the dryer and the lid to keep the lid from closing. It would be good if the case lid had something to keep it open. Otherwise, this is a great dryer.</li>
    <li> I brought this dryer because I got tired of hard bonnets (top snapping off and trying to weight it down). Thanks to the drawstrings the bonnet doesn&#x27;t fly off your head when it&#x27;s setting to the high setting. Also, it dries my hair evenly. The only drawback is there is no \\&quot;warm\\&quot; setting (only hot or cool).</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer to take along with me on an overseas trip wherein I would be away from my stylist for about 2 months. The size is perfect but for the most part the dryer itself is not the best quality. The reviews mentioned problems with the hose staying connected to the bonnet but I was desperate and figured I would just manage. Well, the reviews don&#x27;t lie. The parts are shabby at the least and on my first night using the dryer, it kept detaching itself from the bonnet. It was VERY frustrating but I got through it. I have yet to come across anything else comparable to its size so I guess it will have to do for now. My suggestion: If you are not desperate, find something else.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer in September. I didn&#x27;t use it for much other than deep conditioning treatments. However, it doesn&#x27;t really dry your whole head. Its unfortunate, because the bonnet is extra large, however, the power of the blower and the heater is not sufficient to really work with the bonnet.  I also have an old GE from the 1950&#x27;s that is hotter and stronger than this, by at least 2x.  It is unfortunate that once these stopped being manufactured in America, that any errors are unable to be corrected.  I&#x27;ll still use this for deep conditioning, but if you are looking to dry a head of rollers, look somewhere else.</li>
    <li> This is the best dryer; I&#x27;ve tried several others and love this one!!!</li>
    <li> Honestly this hair dryer is amazing.  The bonnet room is just wonderful.  The sleek design and the long cord makes it so easy to move around.  Even my largest hair rollers fit comfortably.  I love it so, I introduced it to several of my friends and even my mother.</li>
    <li> The bonnet is too small and knocks the curlers off.  The heat is not evenly distributed.  Eventually it gets the job done.  If there were more and better options for hair dryers, I would return it.</li>
    <li> This dryer will remind you of the 1950s and 60s.  I absolutely enjoy using it. The bonnet is thick, not flimsy; it fastens easily and the hair dryer does as really good job. The case is of high quality too!  I am so glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I do not use it. But my wife thinks it is great.It is not too loud. And it does a good job.</li>
    <li> It is serving its purpose except I have to use a bit more moisturizer because it leaves my hair extra dry</li>
    <li> This soft bonnet dryer does what it says it would do. my only dislike is that it gets TOO hot. (didnt think that was possible) I had it on hot and it was burning my scalp, then i put it on cool and i still had to take breaks every 5-10 minutes because it was getting extremely hot on my head quick. other than that it works well.</li>
    <li> If you want to waste your time then buy this dryer. Unless your a chipmunk doing your hair then this dryer is not for you and its too expensive if you&#x27;re using to do heat conditioning. I bought the dryer couldn&#x27;t wait to get it and what a bomb! Does it heat? Yes, Does it work for big rollers? NO!!!&lt;br /&gt;a man must have designed this dryer, please...I just want my money back!</li>
    <li> I use the drier almost weekly. It works well for the price that I paid.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery,  good product,  easy to use.</li>
    <li> Omg! I absolutely love this product. It&#x27;s small, easy &amp; convenient. It  dries your ENTIRE head. It&#x27;s not to hot but hot enough. You are able to do other things while drying. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the wall cord is on one side &amp; the tube is on the other side it was a bit awkward to set up at first. I use to own a hooded dryer. The hooded dryer would only dry the top of my hair, but my sides &amp; back would still be wet, &amp; I would be sweating like a dog under there. No comparison to a hooded dryer. Get this one!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and was tired of standing in front of the mirror for ages trying to dry my hair with a diffuser.  Now I can style my hair sit down at my computer and dry my hair while I check email.  I love it!  It also works great with rollers when I want a straighter look.  The hot setting is very hot but I prefer to use cool air on my hair for frizz reasons anyway.  The case is compact - it is easy to pack back up and put away.</li>
    <li> Like most of these hair dryers the disc that holds the hose falls off after a while. Years ago they use to make these to last and last; now they just fall apart because they are made so cheaply!!</li>
    <li> This dryer is very convenient.  It dries my hair quickly within 30 minutes. I&#x27;ve always used hand held dryer for deep conditioning.  Now at least I can sit down and read a book and be pampered. I am also pleased with the heat settings. Great value for price</li>
    <li> Once again, Made in China.  I am comparing it to the awesome GE hair dryers made in the &#x27;60&#x27;s which came with all of the following features that this dryer does NOT have:&lt;br /&gt;Hard shell protective carrying case with two strong metal latches and flexible handle&lt;br /&gt;Nail dryer&lt;br /&gt;Attractive colors and bonnet design&lt;br /&gt;You can take the dryer OUT OF the case&lt;br /&gt;Choice of several temperatures settings and fan speeds (not just Lo Hi)&lt;br /&gt;Elasticized bonnet in addition to drawstrings&lt;br /&gt;Better design for hose insert into bonnet&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to forget purchasing this one and, instead, head to eBay to pick up a quality-made vintage GE dryer.  This horrid item is going back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing this product for almost a year now and when I received an Amazon gift card for my birthday, the time was right to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long locks and before, it would take my hair half a day to dry.  With this dryer, my hair now sets in about 2 hours and the curls are much softer.  Love, love this dryer!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect dryer for my jumbo roller sets! I&#x27;ve bought several other dryers including the belson hot n gold hard bonnet stand dryer and conair dryer attachment and none have been great. The dryer attachment was too small to fit over my rollers and after forcing it my hair was still damp after 2 hours! I&#x27;ve even tried custom modifications with shopping bags out of desperation... fail. This soft bonnet is actually jumbo sized as stated so no problem fitting over my jumbo rollers. This dryer is not too loud so I can watch a movie or youtube vids as my hair dries. It&#x27;s a stylish, compact design... Easy to pack up when you&#x27;re done. It evenly dries my hair in about 1.5 hrs (18 inches long, 3c natural texture). No uncomfortable hot spots in the process and for once I don&#x27;t need to use a towel to protect my ears, neck and shoulders from intense heat as the drawstring effectively keeps the hot air where it belongs. My hair feels healthy, moisturized and bouncy when I&#x27;m done. I love this soft bonnet dryer and have no reason to use a hard bonnet dryer again or any other dryer again for that matter! I intend to keep using this dryer for a long, long time!</li>
    <li> Very convenient, now I can lay and watch TV while I dry my hair.  Adjustable temp, and soft bonnet that I can leave my ears out of.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Gold &#x27;N Hot Jumbo Bonnet Dryer, it exceeds all the advertise aspects. It drys my hair faster than expected.</li>
    <li> LOVE this dryer !  Pefect for my style of hair:).</li>
    <li> I have dreadlocks that are almost 2-3 feet long and hair drying with a regular hair dryer especially in the winter is a chore and not time efficient. This does the trick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to enjoy this dryer. It gets really hot which is great with my thick hair</li>
    <li> Love this dryer !! I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t take up a lot of space but still did the job and wow this is awesome !! It drys my hair pretty quickly and great price !</li>
    <li> Today was my first day using the dryer.  I was completely satisfied.  $55 wasn&#x27;t a bad price to pay considering that my normal trip to the salon is almost the same price.  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> wife loves it&lt;br /&gt;uses it all the time</li>
    <li> This dryer is perfect for my curly hair.  I love it.  I read all the reviews and was concerned that it would break easily.  But now that I have touched it and have used it plenty of times, I think that the criticism is too harsh.  True, the bonnet is not made of tough commercial grade material, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be, that would raise the price -- why pay for something that you don&#x27;t really need. Just show the product respect while putting it together, plan on sitting still until your hair is dry and you will love this dryer.</li>
    <li> I really like this dryer. It gets hot just like the one at the hair salon. I like that it has dual temperature ranges.  This is the best hair dryer. It has a great drying technique and it is convenient.</li>
    <li> Turned it on once and it failed.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer 7 months ago.  I have mature dreads that take 12+ hours to air dry.  This dryer does the trick in about an hour!  It&#x27;s so great!  I read others&#x27; reviews about the attachment piece breaking easily, so I&#x27;ve always been careful while connecting/disconnecting and it&#x27;s been fine.  I also like to put a few drops of essential oil on a cotton ball and put that in the hose.  Once it&#x27;s on, the cotton ball gets blown into the bonnet and it infuses my hair with delightful scents.  I don&#x27;t see any reason why this dryer won&#x27;t last another 5 months.  Then, if that&#x27;s all I get out of it, I&#x27;ll gladly spend $50 to replace it annually.  I don&#x27;t know many other people with dreadlocks, but the few I do know have gotten this dryer based on my recommendation and are very happy they did so.</li>
    <li> I only got this dryer because I always wanted one but never had the room for one on the floor or the hard top.  Found this on Youtube watching lovellyannekya and decided to try it so I won&#x27;t be going to bead on wet hair or leaving the house in the winter with wet hair.  This dryer is great!  It doesn&#x27;t hurt the back of your neck the air comes out nice and soothing not burning.  You can sit anywhere in your home where there is a out let.  It is not too loud was still able to watch TV and hear everything.  It is light weight and easy to storage.  I would recommend to anyone.  Plus it cost more at Sally&#x27;s so here is where to get it.</li>
    <li> Although others were not satisfied with this hair dryer, I am very happy with it.  It gets very hot and serves the purpose that I purchased it for.</li>
    <li> I loved it! Finally the dryer I can put on my head and watch TV at the same time. Doesn&#x27;t get any better!</li>
    <li> I love this dryer… much better than a hard,  hooded dryer… I can put all my locs in the bonnet and chill…</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and need to use a bonnet dryer or it will take forever.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a Conair, but this is so much better. The bonnet rotates on&lt;br /&gt;the hose so it&#x27;s easy to move with it on your head. Bonnet is thicker so&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t tear so easily, dries quickly and evenly. I like the extra settings (high/low&lt;br /&gt;and hot/cool) to get just the right temperature. Would recommend this to&lt;br /&gt;anyone.</li>
    <li> This product dries my hair fast. It&#x27;s an awesome portable dryer! I recomment this product to people who do a lot of wet set/roller set styles.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well can&#x27;t complain...</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first because I have dreds. I wanted something I could all my dreds under unlike the hood dryer I have been using for years. I was pleasantly surprised. It cut my drying time down by 75min. I have thick dreds that are hang to the middle of my back. I was able to get them all under the bonnet comfortably.I do wish the strings would tighten it to fit more snug. I love this product and felt it was money well spent.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic for deep conditioning your hair!!!!</li>
    <li> It does take getting used to, but it really work well.  It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to take traveling.  I would like it if the hose could be propped up somehow, so it doesn&#x27;t rest on my shoulder - it gets hot.</li>
    <li> The heater bonnet worked real good at first. Then after several uses the bonnet would not stay in hose....frustrating because it was working good to dry hair.  I didn&#x27;t use all the time so was too long ago to send back. Bummer for me.</li>
    <li> Great bonnet hairdryer.  I purchased it for my grandmother, who wore out her last one.  She has no complaints about its performance.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this weekly for YEARS.  Only issue is the hard plastic ring in the cap where the tube attaches came out so I sewed it back on with heavy duty thread and kept it pushing. This is great and I would repurchase. Exactly what I needed to do my deep conditioning.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It shaves at least 20 minutes off of my get ready time in the a.m. I searched for this type of hairdryer when I realized that I&#x27;d turned into my mother. I remember she used to put her hair in rollers, then put this puffy air bonnet on and do her make up. Now that I&#x27;m all grown up, I find that I like using the big rollers to straighten and smooth out my naturally curly hair. If I wash my hair at night, I set it on rollers, grab a book and hook up to this dryer. If I wash it in the morning, I put on make up while the bonnet takes care of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;The bonnet is large - which is good in my case. I have a big head of thick hair that becomes supersized when I put it on rollers that look like beer cans. But the results are much better and healthier than using hot irons. There are four settings, low/high and hot/cold. I start on high/hot and finish on low/cold. This seals the curls in.&lt;br /&gt;Quality product, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I hurt myself on vacation and ended up recuperating for the past month with more weeks to go and no mobility to get to hair dresser.  Ordered this on Sat and it arrived Monday at noon. Very nice set up with sufficient room so you do not have to wreck it just to repack it but very little space is wasted as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cute handle retracts into case and the whole thing tucks away easily. Don&#x27;t let the compact size fool you though. this dried my head full of dreadlocs on rollers and had me out after one hour.  My locs are medium sized and halfway down my back (some are over a foot long) but all fit in bonnet (on rod curlers). One hour in this bonnet with gel tightening at the hand rolled roots and now I am bouncin&#x27; and behavin&#x27; beautiful again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this dryer from amazon but it stopped working the third time I used it. I bought it to do my hair for my bday and as I was under it it decided to break down. Hair wet and all. Wouldn&#x27;t give it another try. I&#x27;d rather invest in something a little sturdier.</li>
    <li> I have a tiny little head and this thing is just too big, and the ties are way too loose. I have to literally tie it under my CHIN to get it to say on my head.</li>
    <li> My hair is chemically relax treated, and I roller set my hair the old fashion way. I have been using it for one year now.&lt;br /&gt;The bonnet is spacious enough for big size rollers. The drying time is is shorter than other bonnet hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> For the price that I paid, this does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I use it to set my locs. It gets sufficiently hot, stays on my head, and has been fairly sturdy. My only small gripe is that sometimes it is a little difficult to tighten and burns the back of my neck. I fix this by placing a small folded face cloth at the base of my neck. That seals any gaps and keeps me from burning.</li>
    <li> I have been growing sisterlocks for 6 years; My hair is super thick; to give you an idea many people ask me \\&quot;Is that all your hair?\\&quot;  I just bought this bonnet dryer today because I was sick of the hard bonnet not drying my hair evenly and I thought this would cut time. Well I WAS RIGHT! My hair loved it! I&#x27;m telling you, when I rollerset my hair it can take over 10 hours for it to dry (now, that&#x27;s with me taking breaks because my face gets so hot and I start to sweat so much from sitting under the hood dryer).  After one hour, the whole outer section of my hair was totally dry! I did allow myself 3 hours to sit under the dryer and from what I can tell my hair is dry!  I took a couple of rollers out to test it and they sprung right back! Now, I will be taking it back tomorrow because when I had already hooked it up I realized that the plastic case was cracked but other than that, I&#x27;m soooo happy; no more hard hood dryers for me!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair so the average blow dryer, even with diffuser, just causes frizz.  With this dryer, I can twist my hair into curls, pin them, and dry them more quickly than if I just air-dry.  The bonnet has a drawstring to tighten it around your head, but if you set it on high it tries to blow off your head - you can&#x27;t really get the drawstring tight enough to hold it in place.  The only way to keep it in place is to pull it down over your forehead, which becomes uncomfortable after a few minutes.  However, if I can tolerate it, it speeds up my &amp;#34;getting ready&amp;#34; time considerably.</li>
    <li> Ive had this bonnet dryer for a little over a yr now. When i 1st got it i used 4 a rollerset (i have relaxed hair) &amp; i sat under for 1hr  n it didnt dry completely mayb about 80% . I was dissapointed so i didnt use it for like a year lol but recently ive started using it for deep conditioning. I love it for that purpose (weekly) i only use direct heat 10% of the time but overall i love this bonnet havnt had any malfunction n it relaxes me lol i recieved it as a Christmas gift from my hubby :)</li>
    <li> This dryer dorks very well.  It is light weight and compact. It makes it easy for travel or mobile salon services.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer.  Does not leave hair dry and brittle.  The price was great also.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this dryer.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair and it is naturally curly. I can wear it curly, flat iron it, or roll it on big curlers. My husband likes it when I roll it on big curlers. When I was younger, I could sleep in curlers, but I can&#x27;t do that anymore. This dryer is a lifesaver for me. It takes about an hour and a half to dry my hair, but it does the job. I like the bonnet dryer a lot. I give it four stars only because my husband had to repair the bonnet where the hose connects. The hook-up piece broke and he had to come up with a new sturdier piece that would hold the hose. If you don&#x27;t have an ingenious person around that can fix the bonnet for you, then don&#x27;t buy this hair dryer, because the bonnet will break where it connect to the hose. It is that flimsy. Otherwise, I have had no other problems with this dryer. I have had it for well over a year now.</li>
    <li> Only used once so far. I like that it is easy to sit in chair and Not have to adjuat head ro get hair dry. Easy to set up dried hair evely. I would recommend for someone who wants a inexpensive portable drier.&lt;br /&gt;You are also able to watch TV although you have to turn volume up a bit.</li>
    <li> I have locks that are 12 inches long. This dryer dries my locks much faster then the salon dryer and 3 times faster then the dryers that sets on a table. I like the freedom this dryer gives me, I&#x27;m able to get comfortable while watching TV or a movie. I have the freedom of movement.</li>
    <li> A piece that connects the hose to the dryer was broken. To use the dryer I have to tape the hose to the dryer. By the time I decided to use the dryer I had discarded the box.</li>
    <li> excellent product.  Easy to use and able to fit over curls just great.</li>
    <li> Do not purchase this product unless you wish to order another when the bonnet needs replacement. The drawstring on mine just snapped. The company has today advised me that it does not sell replacement bonnets.  I believe that a product is only as good as its weakest component and that manufacturers should support their products. Therefore, I have given it only a single star.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer! The first time I used it the connector on the bonnet came off. I just glued it back on and now run the dryer on low for the last 15 minutes before I disconnect it. it works great, leaves my long, wavy hair smooth and shiny. The bonnet has no problem fitting over my jumbo rollers. I do run the dryer standing on edge ( like an open book), to allow for air flow on the top and bottom. I just love it, highly recommended! May 2015 The connection between the hose and the bonnet has worn out. I am using a replacement bonnet but the hose will not stay connected.  I am going to replace this unit, it has served me well since I have used it once a week since I bought it!  The unit still works, the hose needs to be replaced!</li>
    <li> Meeting my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;High setting does not get too hot which requires longer staying longer under the hood.  Overall, I like it.</li>
    <li> I have owned this hair dryer for at least a year now, using it about once a day, sometimes two or three times (my kids like to use it).  Overall, I have had no trouble the the mechanics or the blower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beef is with the bonnet, which has needed so much patch and repair work that there&#x27;s very little original bonnet left.  The plastic hose-lock circle pulled out within a week, the drawstrings ripped out the week after that.  I pinned the strings back in place, but that just ripped the plastic that covered them.  Taped that, and the plastic on either side of the elastic tore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the bonnet over curlers, but it&#x27;s plenty large to fit so there&#x27;s no undue mechanical strain.  It&#x27;s the poor construction and materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there was a replacement bonnet available, I&#x27;d be willing to keep changing it out, but apparently there isn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ll be trying one of the bonnets that fit over a regular hairdryer.  Sort of wish I&#x27;d just done that in the first place.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer about two years ago to use with my rollers, and I was very impressed with it!! I love using this, it dries my waist length hair well. I also like that there is a cool setting so when I don&#x27;t want to use heat on my hair, I have the option to switch to cool air instead. I strongly recommend this dryer to anyone who wants a dependable, durable, hair dryer that is large enough to accommodate waist length hair in jumbo rollers.</li>
    <li> I used this hairdryer for the first time today.  It is exactly as described and was well worth the money.  It is light weight, has 2 motor speeds and 2 heat settings.  The bonnet is large and soft.  The cord, hose and bonnet fold neatly into the case.  The case is compact and attractive, easy to store and not unsightly. This will be great for travel.  When using on high heat, the hose does get a little hot on the neck.  I purchased this because I was tired of the time it takes to style my hair using hot rollers, curling irons and blow dryers.  I went retro, using old fashioned brush rollers and this dryer.  It works!  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this dryer.</li>
    <li> Gold &#x27;N Hot GH3984 Ionic Soft Jumbo  Bonnet Dryer:  There needs to be a visible label showing where to open this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It is difficult to put on if you are using butterfly clips to hold the rollers in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have sent tne Gold N&#x27; Hot back  However I made an error on the carrier an left a scratch mark.  Still, I would not buy it again. It was cumberson and generally in the way when in use.</li>
    <li> The positive:&lt;br /&gt;Nice compact carry case, solid looking components, well thought-out design, nice big hood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative:&lt;br /&gt;Air was delivered only to the back of my head, not the top, sides, or front. Too bad, I liked the idea! But it had to go back. :-(</li>
    <li> This dryer works.  I have thick hair that comes a little past my shoulder.  I do a roller set with big rollers and it&#x27;s takes about an hour 20 minutes to dry.  It&#x27;s much more comfortable than sitting under a hard hat.  I can move around more and hear my tv better.</li>
    <li> Does a great job, gets really hot. This is important for me because my hair is so thick.  I use really large rollers and have no problem with the bonnet fitting. I do wish I could order an extra bonnet.</li>
    <li> This is the second dryer I purchase.  Love to wash my hair and sit under this dryer.  My hair is more manageable and I can relax watching tv or reading.</li>
    <li> There are three of us who roller set our hair so I needed another one! The cap is flexible so it can fit very large to small rollers. Heat settings just enough so dries hair very well.  We all like the fact that we can do other things besides sit under the dryer. The first dryer was great I have no problems with it but the second,the attachment on the bonnet that attaches to the hose came off.  I have been looking to buy an extra bonnet but so far no luck.  I would hate to have to buy another dryer.  Besides that annoyance it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Bought one less than one month ago, and the bonnet is already torn.  This is the second one I purchased.  The hosing tore on the first one.  Unfortunately there are not many other choices.  When all parts are intact, it does work well.</li>
    <li> Dryer worked fine however when used with heat the connector in bonnet would separate from the bonnet.  I would fix after each use but finally there is no repair.  I will return and look for something more durable.</li>
    <li> It is just what I was hoping for.  It gets hot but not too hot.  The caps is a bit bigger than it has to be and would be less awkward smaller but that is a minor critique.</li>
    <li> There were so few bonnet hair dryers for sale that I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t get a good one. But this is the best bonnet hair dryer I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but it works great. It gets very lot. Parts of my hair were still a little damp when I was done. I was under this dryer for the same time that I spend under the salon dryer. I think 15 more minutes and my hair would have been completely dry. So I say all that to say, this dryer is a great home dryer and I will definitely make it part of my regular beauty routine.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. My daughter has extreme thick curly hair and this is absolutely does the job.</li>
    <li> everything seemed good until I turned it on! The air lifted it off my head and there is no way to tighten it &amp;#34;more&amp;#34; to make it stay on!  I tightened it as far as it could go and needed at lease 2-3 in more. (23 inch hat btw -  don&#x27;t think that is such a small head)&lt;br /&gt;I ended up having to hold it or put a headband on to keep it on... so annoying, I should have just returned it but I needed something for a deep conditioning... will not purchase again. As info I did purchase a clothes steamer for deep conditioning my 4C hair quickly (saw it on you tube for naturals)</li>
    <li> I use this product in conjunction with my deep conditioning sessions. It&#x27;s lightweight and very portable. It takes up practically no space in my closet, and It&#x27;s easy to replace the individual components when done. There is a string that allows you to tighten the bonnet so it doesn&#x27;t fly off your head. I like the different setting options so I can set the dryer to my liking. I would recommend this dryer to anyone.</li>
    <li> Life saver! Works on my 4 year old and even adults. I haven&#x27;t tried it personally but I love the results of others</li>
    <li> The heat settings are too hot or cold , no in between. I only kept it because a needed a dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but it did everything it promised to do. I think I will buy my sister one.</li>
    <li> It was difficult to find the perfect Bonnet dryer, but this one is the best!  I am so pleased I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The product works great. it arrived on time and was easy to set up and the heat was excellent and dried my hair in about 25 minutes.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these my wife has gotten--had me order for her. It is a pretty nice dryer, but it has the same problems as the other one she bought about two years ago.  The bonnet is weak and fragile, and will again rip where the draw cord is.  The hose is too short.  It should be about a foot or more longer.  And the thing is only 500 watts (takes a good while to get your hair dry) and is loud enough to be mistaken to a small plane taking off.  On the other hand, my wife does really like it a lot; which is why we ordered another one to replace the first....</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to wear over rollers so that I could use my hands to put on make-up, etc. while my hair was drying.  It worked great the first 2 or 3 times.  Then, the elastic on the bonnet completely failed and the bonnet would not stay on, no matter how tightly I tied the back.  I liked the packaging, how the dryer works, and the overall concept.  However, if the bonnet won&#x27;t stay on, it is useless.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer. The only problem is it gets too hot sometimes and can feel uncomfortable. If you position the nozzle toward the back with most of your hair bunched up in the back it&#x27;s fine. It does a great job without a lot of time.</li>
    <li> Love this, such a great alternative to a big bulky dryer. Great product.</li>
    <li> It is the worst dryer I have ever bought.  the bonnet does not stay on my head, the hose continually come off the bonnet. I would not recommend this dryer to anyone.  I would gladly give mine away if anyone wants it.  I have bought other products that were fine, but this dryer is awful.</li>
    <li> i had read the reviews on the connection of the hose to the cap..so I am watching/being careful.  other than that it works fine</li>
    <li> So far so good&lt;br /&gt;Huge Bonnet&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use</li>
    <li> I bought this bonnet hair dryer about a month ago. I used it twice &amp; it worked great. Dried my hair quickly, not too much heat on my neck, none on my face. Third time I used it the hose would not stay attached. I had to tape it on. The thing just would not stay put. Sadly, I didn&#x27;t keep the receipt or else I&#x27;d return it.</li>
    <li> Love the style dryer but I know the bonnet won&#x27;t last a year...I use it once a week. Hair dries quickly</li>
    <li> The cap does not stay on good while drying.  The airflow IS good. Just was not happy with this product.</li>
    <li> GREAT LIKE THE PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I can sleep, eat &amp; poop with this thing on. Works wonders &amp; just as good as sitting under an actual dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for years and love it!  I have natural hair and use this mainly for my deep conditioners and hot oil treatments.  I dry my hair without heat so I can&#x27;t comment on how quickly it dries hair.  I had a hard bonnet dryer in the past but didn&#x27;t like it for several reasons which makes me love my soft bonnet&lt;br /&gt;- Heat distribution:  The heat gets to all aspects of my hair.  I didn&#x27;t like how with the hard bonnet, certain parts of my head wasn&#x27;t exposed to the heat.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about that with this product.&lt;br /&gt;- Comfort/Versatility:  I can move around (within reason), do other things like watch a movie (and not worry about the bonnet getting in my peripheral vision and having to move it up like I did with the hard bonnet) or use my laptop.  Soft bonnet is so much more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;- Size: The bonnet inflates a lot but it has a loop tie in the back to secure it.  I read some of other people&#x27;s comments about this not fitting if you have short hair.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues but have only used this since I had nape length hair.  I haven&#x27;t tried this with curlers so can&#x27;t comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;- Ease of use/storage: It has a hot or cool setting.  Everything is easy to store and quite compact unlike hard bonnets which can take up space.  Cord is foldable, detachable hose (no issues with it not staying in place once I click it into the bonnet unlike another user) and bonnet are easily contained in their individual compartments in the case.  Then the case can be stored anywhere you&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, I love it (as you can tell)!</li>
    <li> I have owned several of these.  I tend to use them a lot.  They generally last for about six to eight months, but the last one I bought started screeching after about a month of use.  I will not be buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> It was discounted due to a damaged box. When it arrived it he box was not damaged at all. The dryer works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This dryer is the bomb! I have long dreads and it dries them in no time.  Sometimes it gets too hot and I have to turn it down.  I recommend this dryer for anyone who has a lot of hair it works and works well.</li>
    <li> The house do not stay in the hood.</li>
    <li> My African American hair is very thick and this allows it to dry in record time.  Sometimes it gets a little too hot so I love that you can keep the voume of airflow but change to a cooler setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little big but that&#x27;s only a minor, personal irritation.</li>
    <li> I gave this a 5 because it is everything as advertised. Came packaged well , heats and dries my hair fast, love the ease of opening and closing and storing. wonderful product. would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> even though it is loud and have only 2 drying preferences this dryer still gets the job done especially for my hair which is locked and long...good product!!! would recommend!!</li>
    <li> The soft bonnet is kinda flimsy, seems like it would rip easily.  The drawstring does not close over my peanut size head so air escapes out the sides.  Not good.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for hot oil treatments. It also makes drying your hair easy and efficient. Overall it&#x27;s a good product</li>
    <li> I love the Gold &#x27;N Hot dryer.  It the perfect size for large rollers and the heat distribution is good.  The dryer is very easy to handle and it looks good.</li>
    <li> good buy for hard to find item.</li>
    <li> I returned this because it had a terrible odor.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to save space more than money. So the hooded soft had is TOO SOFT. It already broke the fourth time i used it. The string attanched to the hood broke off while I was tighten it. It doesn&#x27;t heat up much although it had a HIGH option. It used to take 1 1/2-2 hours to dry. My hair is natural (mix of 3c-4a) shoulder length, gray rollers. I figured to attach the broken string back (don&#x27;t ask me how) but I have it for emegencies/traveling for now. had to buy another dryers (the pibbs) b/c this one was not doing the function i was expecting it. My time is too limited to sit under this dryer for almost 2 hours (and I am not even counting the 30-40 minutes to wash, deep condition and detangle my hair, and the 40 minutes i spend doing my own rollers).&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mine the time and the cheaply made item, go ahead. I believe Gold &#x27;N Hot products are not as durable as before. You may get lucky.</li>
    <li> great product and great service - would definitely recommend - was told would be here on Saturday but came early on Friday - Product extremely easy to operate - light weight and extremely portable</li>
    <li> I thought these hair dryers were no longer in production. I was excited to find out they are still around. I purchased this unit and was well pleased! I slept comfortably with the hair dryer powered on for 4hrs. It did not burn my skin. Actually the modern conventional hairdryers burn the skin especially the face. These are soooo much better!</li>
    <li> Great little Bonnet Dryer. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and it&#x27;s powerful. I use it for oil treatments and lightly drying my wet hair. The Dry has only two settings, but that is enough for what I require. The bonnet stays on due to two draw strings on the back. Really like the product and the delivery was excellent!</li>
    <li> Spectacular product. Worth every penny. Wonderful dryer! A+++</li>
    <li> Great for my thick long hair</li>
    <li> I like this hair dyer but have found a few problems with it. It has a \\&quot;hot spot\\&quot; where more heat seems to hit a certain spot on my head and I have to shift the cap every couple of minutes. Also, the last time I used it the piece that clips the hose into the cap fell out. For the price this is a good hair dryer and I&#x27;m still glad that I got it, it&#x27;s just annoying sometimes.</li>
    <li> After years of using the Carel bonnet dryers, I was tired of not being able to replace the crappy bonnets that would tear and a dryer hose that kept detaching from the bonnet, I decided to treat myself to a new dryer.  Due to the rave reviews, I took a chance.  This is simply the best bonnet dryer ever!  The bonnet is very sturdy, thick material that inflates perfectly.  The hose locks in and doesn&#x27;t snap out if you move your head an inch.  AND the heat settings are great!  The hi is hot so be careful...I found after using the hi setting for awhile, I could switch to low and finish off the roller set and my hair curled beautifully!  Also, the tie string is a heavy duty shoestring that isn&#x27;t going to break, snap or wear down to nothing.  I&#x27;m serious...I have always preferred bonnet dryers with roller sets verses blow dryers.  I don&#x27;t understand why hair dressers blow dry your hair stick straight glue down to your head with no volumen then pull out that stupid curling iron and spend an hour trying to put curls BACK in your hair.  Roller sets are THE way to go!  And this is a great, great dryer!  I&#x27;m sold!!!</li>
    <li> I heard such great reviews on this item so I bought it. It was difficult to just turn it off and on. Poor design with the on/off switch. It worked fine otherwise except my hair sweated under the cap. Going back to the sit under hooded dryer.</li>
    <li> The mechanics of this dryer is great however, it&#x27;s hard to keep it on your head with the high speed. I have to tie it so tight that it almost give me a headache and that should be a very relaxing time.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed my dryer thus far. I look forward to washing my hair and doing deep conditions!! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer, perfect size, excellent performance! Makes the task of sitting under the dryer so much easier. Great value</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this since she loves to dry her hair and read.  It does take a long time to dry the hair thoroughly and usually she&#x27;s not willing to wait quite long enough for her curls to really set.</li>
