<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have dry skin and prefer a cleanser that won&#x27;t strip my skin and leave it feeling dryer than before; however, this cleanser doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling clean.  It leaves my skin feeling as though there is a thick film over it.  Disclosure: I live in a humid climate, so if you live in a dry climate, this may be the perfect product for you.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it leaves my face thoroughly cleansed but moisturized at the same time.  THAT is a combo hard to come by! And as I age, it is more and more important to have both those qualities is a product.  I keep one jar by the sink for use at night and one in the shower for use in the mornings.</li>
    <li> If nothing else, I hope no one ever purchases these Gratiae or Gold Elements or Dead Sea products from the Premier spa stores.  Complete con-artists that will rob you.  Buying on-line from Amazon means you get the quality product you expect and save hundreds.  (not exaggerating).  This cleanser feels great and arrived in fantastic condition in a timely manner.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me . It was to oily  . I started to brake down</li>
    <li> This is a gentle product great for all skin types. I like to leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing off to enjoy the heavenly fragrance.</li>
    <li> l suppose this would be great for someone with dry skin.  l as blessed with oily skin, so this feels too greasy.  Smells divine tho.&lt;br /&gt;lf you have dry skin, this is the cleanser for you.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  It last a long time so you only have to use a little.  I really like it alot and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser twice a day, everyday, for the past few years. It&#x27;s perfect for my combination skin and leaves me with a radiant, moisturized complexion every time. Anybody who has combo skin would understand what a blessing it is to find a balanced cleanser that contributes to neither breakouts or dryness.  In conjunction with this cleanser, I also lightly mist my face and throat with rosewater for toning and moisturize by massaging a few drops of rosehip seed oil. I&#x27;m 35, wear no foundation (I find it bothersome!), but most think I&#x27;m years younger, if that&#x27;s any testament to a good skin care regimen! :)  Update: Just want to say that if some think this is a tad pricey, a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve had one bottle last me nearly 8 months. It&#x27;s very affordable if you pro-rate the cost out. :)</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin soft and glowing.  Takes mascara off easily as well.  I love this product as well as their moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have using this cleanser since I found it in Vegas.  It is so much cheaper to buy it here and the service is great! Buy it now!</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be more of a soap, but its more like a cream. Coupled with the lifting moisturizing cream its a bit to much for someone with normal skin.</li>
    <li> I use this as cold cream to take my makeup off when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face or if my skin is dry. I absolutely love it. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I ran across the Gratiae products for the first time while on vacation in Vegas. I purchased the facial cleanser and the Obey Your Body Peeling Gel. I fell in love with them both so when I got home I went on a search for additional products and found the toner. The facial cleanser is GREAT it has a pleasant smell (roses) and leaves your face feeling clean and soft unlike other soap based cleanser I have used in the past. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obey Your Body is owned by the same company as Gratiae (both are from Israel). I now use on regular bases products from both lines - they work well together.&lt;br /&gt;Favorites are: Gratiae Facial Cleansing Lotion, Gratiae Cleansing Toner, Gratiae Exfoliating Body Scrub,  Obey Your Body Peeling Gel (love this), Obey Your Body Radiance Serum Lift, Obey Your Body Eye Contour Cream, Obey Your Body Day Cream w/ SPF 15</li>
    <li> This is my MUST HAVE product. Because it is a lotion-based cleanser you can either rinse it off after use or just pat off the excess with a cloth and it will not irritate your skin or make you break out because of the lack of soap. Also attributed to the lack of soap in this product is the product&#x27;s ability to leave your skin soft and moisturized, rather than squeaky, dry and tight. This works wonders for me, living in South Texas because of our hard water. I thought my issue was greasy skin that clogged my pores, but then I realized that my overly oily skin was the product of harsh and drying soaps, mixed with the extreme drying effects of the hard water. After introducing this product into my daily routine, I have noticed a significantly clearer complexion and short lived acne that disappears within a day or two, rather than sticking around for weeks. This product is a life-saver! My top facial care pick! Oh, it also removes stubborn makeup well because it is a lotion, how perfect! It is like a wash, makeup remover and moisturizer all in one! (But, I still recommend a moisturizer in addition to and not using this as a substitute for it!) LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years. I almost never have a breakout and don&#x27;t experience any dryness with my skin. This has been an ongoing problem for me throughout my life.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of this product range. This particular cleanser has a lovely texture, subtle scent, is gentle yet effective. I have reasonably sensitive skin and have no problems with this cleanser or any of the other Gratiae products. Only need to use a small amount, so economical too!</li>
    <li> I found these while in Vegas but couldn&#x27;t afford them and now get them on Amazon. They are fantastic and leave my skin feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> All Gratiae products work great! This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. I absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this in Las Vegas at a street vendor and paid 5 times more for the same product.  Cleans gently and leaves your skin soft.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleanser, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. It leaves your skin clean and so soft.</li>
    <li> Best facial cleanser ever.  Removes make up and environmental pollutants without drying out skin.  Purchase on Amazon.com for a fraction of the retail price.  All certified organic ingredients .... LOVE IT!!!  You will see immediate results and people will notice.</li>
    <li> this product is very fresh , light &amp; smells very clean. my skin is very sensitive and this product works great! glad i found it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.I have old age setting in, makes my facial skin feel hydrated and refreshed. No need for special lotion afterwards. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> Good cleanser for the price.  Never buy this product in Las Vegas.  Very expensive.  Very reasonable price through Amazon.  I probably will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very luxurious.  My skin is very dry, and this gives it lots of moisture.  Compares with very expensive cleansers for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I got hooked on this cleanser from one of the mall &amp;#34;specials&amp;#34;.....they got my money ONCE....but now that I have found it I can afford to use it all the time......It cleans very well and you do not necessarily need to use a moisturizer after it</li>
    <li> GOOD FOR TAKING OFF EYE MAKE UP AT NIGHT AND CLEANSING THE SKIN.</li>
    <li> the gratiae organic facial cleanser lotion works good and quite effective for the price. i would recommend this facial lotion.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I use it every night to take my make up off and it leaves my skin soft. Great for dry skin types.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff, and use it in the shower off and on.  Can be used both wet and dry and I like that</li>
    <li> originally bought this product in Vegas and loved it.  I was glad to find it here on Amazon</li>
    <li> I was using the foaming cleanser and the other one with the scrub in it. Using it everyday was drying to my face. So I ordered this one to alternate with the others. I use the scrub one two times a week at night or in the morning and I use this one everynight and I use the foaming one a couple times of week at night. My skin looks the best it has in a long time. I use this one with water and a little goes a long way. I like the smell and the way my face feels afterwards. I have oily skin but this does not make my face oily. In fact with the regimen I am using my face has actually become less Oily. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Cleanses very well; try it-clean your face with your favorite product, then, gently wipe with this products afterwards-you will notice that it removes surface dirt even after another cleansing product.</li>
    <li> I use this for removing my makeup. I usually use it twice to make sure i get my face clean. It works well and leaves my face soft.</li>
    <li> This came to me with the bottle just &#x27;thrown&#x27; into a shipping box....no box container for the bottle....the pump part of the product didn&#x27;t work so I sent it back.  Can&#x27;t tell you how the lotion actually was as I was so turned off, I immediately sent it back.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely cream cleanser that only needs a wipe off with a makeup wipe.  It leaves my skin soft and moisturized. Very pleased with the price @ Amazon and the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> I decided to try a gentler cleansing routine after watching the famous youtuber Lisa Eldridge. I had never even heard of a cleansing lotion before. Because I am on Accutane, my skin is very dry, delicate, and prone to peeling. I stopped using my regular cleanser altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on when I want to remove my makeup. I massage it in for about 10-20 seconds and then wipe my face clean with a damp wash cloth. It powers through longwear makeup with a little massaging. I find it so much more relaxing to use than a traditional cleanser because I don&#x27;t feel rushed to get it off my face. It&#x27;s not soap. No running water or vigorous washing needed to remove it. It doesn&#x27;t get in my eyes, either. The smell is pleasant and not too overpowering. Not floral or soapy. I can smell a hint of aloe, but the dominant smell is something else. It&#x27;s very clean smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After starting this regime, I&#x27;ve noticed that my face has stopped with its constant flaking and peeling. It feels normal and hydrated. When I go back and think about when I used to cleanse every night to get my makeup off, I have to wince. My skin was so dried out!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin soft and moisturized. Would recommend it for anyone with dry skin issues.</li>
    <li> I bought this in Las Vegas (see other reviews of this brand) and I do love it more than any other cleanser. I found it here on Amazon and saved hundreds. Too bad you have to get duped in other locations.</li>
    <li> I like this product it has a very nice aroma, goes on silky smooth and is easy to wash off.  Very nice cleanser..</li>
    <li> great product, have used for years now</li>
    <li> love, love, love this product!  Best facial cleanser i have ever used.  GREAT for removing makeup w/o drying skin!!!  i will use this for life!  I have bought it for all my girls!</li>
    <li> My teenager daughter just started wearing eye makeup and loves this to take off her makeup!  She is not big on using water on her face so this is perfect.  The only thing is if you use this on your whole face it can tend to feel oily so not great for oily skin but its great for us in Colorado with all of our dry weather.</li>
    <li> I use this with the toner and am very happy with the results. Smooth skin and no more problems with rosacea.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, this is a fantastic cleanser.  Wonderful texture and scent.  Often I find organic products less effective, but not so in this case.</li>
    <li> This product has a very soft aroma.  It makes my face feel soft and smooth after I use it.  I also use other Gratiae products.  I appreciate being able to purchase them online.</li>
    <li> I was in hopes this would be a good facial cleanser for me as I was trying to find something fast because I realized the sls and parabens in the products I was using was causing me problems and I made a fast change to organic products. The fragrance is really too strong and it made my face burn and get red. I had to return it. It was the same with the Gratiae Eye Cream. it burned and made my eyes red and runny. It took a week to get them  calmed down and it too has a real strong fragrance and perhaps that was the problem but it didn&#x27;t work my my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Was not for my type of skin</li>
    <li> I am very very pleased with this cleanser.  You have to use very little, it is smooth and has a very nice light scent.  I am extremely pleased with this product and will order it again.</li>
    <li> This product is the best facial cleanser I have ever used. It leaves your face clean and feeling moist and as soft as baby skin. I love being able to buy it from Amazon, you give such good prices and super delivery service. Thank you so much for being there with such good products.</li>

    <li> Love this and price is good</li>
    <li> Very gentle cleansing lotion for the face. I have mature skin and it is nourishing and not drying. Great seller to order from too.</li>
    <li> A product I use daily.  Very gentle and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> nice feel to this product, didn&#x27;t dry  my face out.  Works nicely with the moisturizing creams by same company  thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 4 years and love it . It is not oiley feeling and it leaves your  skin soft.</li>
    <li> I have been an Arbonne RE9 user for about seven years.  When they changed their product line a year ago, I stocked up on the old line and just ran out.  I was so sad, but gave the new line a shot and immediately broke out.  I was so sad.  Arbonne had been the only face system I&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remembered an old cleansing lotion I used of my mother&#x27;s in the 80&#x27;s.  So, I decided to find a new version and I believe I&#x27;ve found it!  I absolutely love this lotion!  I can use it as a rinse off (which is what I usually do) or wash cloth off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is non-drying and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  I cannot stress enough how incredible this is and that I&#x27;ve only had one other product in my whole life that I can say that about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, the price.  The price on here cannot be beat!  Great product and price!</li>
    <li> Perfectly clean, gentle, non-greasy and leaves a moistness to your skin. I&#x27;ve tried the rest...this is the best and a pea size amount does the job. So even if economy is a concern, the price is right!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and feels clean and does not leave a residue.  I would recommend this product for cleansing</li>
    <li> Slightly different than the old cleansing foam, but okay I guess.</li>
    <li> I love this product ❤️ I will never use anything else. I have very dry skin and this product does not strip or make it worse. Actually it makes my skin feel silky. ❤️❤️</li>
    <li> I Love this cleansing cream and have been using it for over a year now.  Gentle and light on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product and delivery was quick and simple</li>
    <li> I use this every night. I put extra on and leave it on my face to moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find this on Amazon with the price being less expensive than what I had paid for my first bottle of this cleanser because I really love this cleanser because it leaves my face feeling full of moisture and not dried out.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Excellent : I rec&#x27;d before I realized I had orederd&lt;br /&gt;Using this makes my skin feel soft and clean&lt;br /&gt;Must try and use</li>
    <li> Totally nice product and as described!  :)</li>
    <li> The best i have ever used . I will not use anything else.  My face is very dry and this cleanser leaves my face feeling so soft and feeling good.</li>
    <li> I only use this to clean the eye makeup off and it is amazing.  I won&#x27;t use any other product around my eyes.  I use the gold cleanser from this company to clean the rest of my face.  I even make sure I have it in a travel container with me when we go on trips!</li>
