<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is wonderful always remember to rinse with warm water lots of times first.</li>
    <li> The smell is not that great, but it leaves my skin and face feeling soft than using my current bodywash. And I have myn husband using it too so that is a plus!</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I have acne but once I started to use this it looked clearer in less then a week. It&#x27;s also gotten my scars to fade. Once or twice a week I add a pinch of baking soda into my hand with the soap and GENTLY exfoliate. It leaves my fave baby-soft.</li>
    <li> I usually use clean and clear or some type of cleanser like that but they stripped my face of any and all oils leaving my face to peel. So i went and found a nutrition store selling this stuff and i fell deeply in love with it. It does wonders for my face. Especially after i use cocoa butter and olive overnight. LOVE THIS ProdUCt.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap and also works well as shampoo.  Arrived quickly and without any leaks.</li>
    <li> Great soap. It would be nice of it came with an optional pump top.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural soap for your face and hair. If you have a teenager that is starting to get or has pimples/acne, daily facial washing with this soap will greatly reduce/eliminate all pimples in just a month and keep them away with continued use. My two teens swear by it and have eliminated all of their pimples!</li>
    <li> I love it. It doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing. Love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel soft and moisturized was using other soaps until this was recommended to me and i just ordered another one.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap!</li>
    <li> This soap is friggin amazing!! I suffer from acne but with everyday use of this soap and aloe Vera gel (toner) and coconut oil as my moisturizer, my skin is smooth and acne free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this though, you have to use a facial scrub because the soap will leave light residue on your face. I make my own facial scrub with brown sugar,honey and olive oil. Exfoliate every other day and you&#x27;re good to go. Also don&#x27;t forget to drink at least 8 glasses of water everyday, use paper towels to dry your face and change those pillow cases weekly. You&#x27;d be surprised at how  much your skin improves :)</li>
    <li> love this soap.  got two bottles so I wouldn&#x27;t have to share:) leaves my skin silky smooth.  price was great too.</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for one week and it seems to work pretty good. We use it on our face and body. I break out from time to time but this soap seems to keep my face clear.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I love black soap, but have used it in bar form before. This product is great on skin and hair. The scent is very subtle, not sweet or chemical. A little goes a long way. I have a dry skin reaction to some products, no problem with this one. Price was very reasonable, service was fast.</li>
    <li> Let me first say I bought this product in JUNE and I&#x27;m doing a review now so I can give the product a decent chance on working. I have oily, acne prone skin, with acne scars...or better yet HAD acne scars. I have NOT broken out since I started using this product as a face and body wash. It literally almost erased my acne scars that were all over my face. I am definitely going to buy this product again. I completely stopped using foundation. No need to hid my face ever again as long as this product is out on the market. For the size and price...u can&#x27;t go wrong!!!!</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin I would suggest adding more Shea oil or Aloe vera oil or both. But this leaves you feeling clean all over. And great as a shampoo as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s good stuff, women like it even though they say it&#x27;s not a feminine smell it really does have a slight perfume-y scent from ingredients, more like an incense smell than women&#x27;s perfume.. but close. Great on skin works as said etc,  Thanks</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING Soap!  So many uses!!  I use it to wash my hair- face and body!!  Can be used in a &amp;#34;foamer&amp;#34; for hand soap as well! I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I swear by this product. I will probably not ever use anything else to wash my face again! I have been using it for about a year now and it has improved the texture and appearance of my skin and reduced my acne.</li>
    <li> Gentle on skin! The large bottle will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good at all. It was ok but you can find better products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to use for a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have sulfates in it, because I have seborrheic dermatitis which every shampoo I have tried seems to aggravate. even the so-called sulfate free products don&#x27;t help much.  This stuff works GREAT!  I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner either.  It says on the bottle you can use it for body wash and shampoo.  I was suprised by the complaints about the odor, because I think that it smells good, but perhaps that&#x27;s just a matter of preference.</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I have Tried this brand. I love it! My Skin is so smooth now. My whole family has started using this. The Price can&#x27;t be beat! The smell is not over powerful like some brands! This is perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought this product cause it was recommended to me and I had always been a consumer of Dr. Bronner liquid soaps.  It is mild in fragrance and the shea butter ingredient is a good thing for dry skin.   I do recommend this product and the 32 oz bottle seemed to be the best price for the money.</li>
    <li> A great formulation for cleansing without damaging fairly sensitive skin. Provides the right balance between exfoliating and merely stimulating the face and any delicate areas. Hats off to Dr. Woods!</li>
    <li> I just bought my second one of these, surprised how long it lasted.  I do not use it as shampoo but body wash works perfectly</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing after just one use my skin was noticeably softer and just felt so smooth. I love it I am completely sold and will use this for my skin care.</li>
    <li> Great on skin and hair, and a much healthier choice than most, if not all, other brands out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through so many different facial cleansers, and finally found one I have stuck with for awhile now.  This Pure Black Soap with Organic Shea Butter is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY SKIN:&lt;br /&gt;My face is combination.  In winter months, it gets very dry and flaky.  The rest of the year, it is very oily and I am prone to lots of blackheads with the occasional larger pimple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EFFICACY:&lt;br /&gt;This soap works so well with my skin.  It dries it out in the winter, still, but the least of any other cleansers I&#x27;ve tried.  It cleans away dirt and oil so well, and leaves my skin feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCENT:&lt;br /&gt;Smells odd, but smells clean.  Not at all fruity or floral, but hard to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER USES:&lt;br /&gt;It says you can use it on hair, body, in laundry, and to clean your home.  So far, I use it as a facial cleanser.  I tried it on my hair, but it didn&#x27;t produce very good results.  Takes a lot to clean my hair, and makes it very static-prone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONSISTENCY:&lt;br /&gt;This soap is a little runny, but pours out of the bottle easily that way.  You don&#x27;t get a ton of lather, but the right amount to cleanse well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE:&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients!  NO parabens, artificial scents, weird unpronounceable chemicals...it is just natural which is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to those who desire a natural facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t horribly over-dry in the winter, but cleanses fully in hot, sticky weather.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail this morning, and the first thing I did was wash my hair! I am currently in the process of going natural...and my transitioning hair LOVED this as a shampoo! It left my hair soft! It does have a initial scent, but it does not stick around! I am ready to use this as a body wash among other things!</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for this product but have been disappointed.  At least for washing hair option.  Leaves hair very dry and tangled and coarse.  Hard to comb out.  Ok for bathing.</li>
    <li> I used it on my hair &amp; I have natural 4a hair. It made it really soft. Even though it contains fragrance, there is no strong smell to it so that was great! I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I go through this stuff so fast!  It&#x27;s so versatile and I love the scent.  I use it sometimes as body or face wash and sometimes a shampoo.  You can even clean your shower wall if you want!  I always put this in little travel containers to take on trips!</li>
    <li> This soap is the absolute BEST soap I have ever used! After washing with this soap, I KNOW my face is clean and it feels clean! I have not had even a tiny pimple since using this black soap.  I will be ordering again, so keep on making it,!</li>
    <li> I DON&#x27;T LIKE THE SMELL OF THIS AT ALL. JUST BEING HONEST.  I USED THIS FOR MY FACE FOR 2 MONTHS UNTIL I STARTED TO GET DRY SPOTS.  EVEN WHEN I FOLLOWED BEHIND THIS WITH SHEA OIL.  SO I DECIDED TO TRY IT AS A BODY WASH.  IT CLEANSES WELL BUT I STILL WASN&#x27;T IN AWE.  NOW I AM NEWLY NATURAL AND NEEDED A MORE \\&quot;ORGANIC SHAMPOO\\&quot;  SO I GAVE THIS A WHIRL AND I LOVE IT.  MY HAIR FEELS GREAT, SCALP IS CLEAN, AND HAIR IS SOFT AND SHINY.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay....has an unusual smell but liveable....you have to use a lot if you like it sudsy....doesn&#x27;t leave a soap film....you feel very clean afterwards.</li>
    <li> love this gentle soap</li>
    <li> Great soap.  I have dry skin and this soap leaves my skin feeling the best.</li>
    <li> I originally discovered Dr. Woods Pure Black Soap at our local grocery store.  In my quest to go more organic, I decided to give it a try.  I loved the fact that it is made of pure organic ingredients and it cleans so well.  The fragrance is natural and very pleasant.  I have sensitive skin and I use it as a body wash, as well as a shampoo.  While in the shower, you can use it to clean the tile walls and floor!  It makes my skin and hair soft and smells so clean.  I have even replaced my expensive moisturizing facial soap with this product as it contains shea butter.  I also love that it is cruelty-free, paraben-free, sulfate-free, and petroleum-free.  My grocery store stopped carrying it and replaced it with a much more expensive product with similar ingredients, so I was excited to find it on my old friend Amazon.  Now I purchase my supply online, get it delivered to my door, and save money.  I have ordered this product for some of my family members and they all like it too.  It is a bargain for such a quality product!</li>
    <li> Dont see a major change, in honesty its a basic product but there is definetly better. Didnt calm my eczema, but the smell is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Good for cleaning my tub.</li>
    <li> Concentrated so a little goes a long way. Smells great (naturally) and has a wonderful effect on my skin. I prefer it to Dr. Bronners that I have used for 20 years. My new favorite soap.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic all purpose soap, we wash our hands, hair, face and body with this soap and it is great!  Some in our family don&#x27;t care for the smell too much, but personally I like the scent.  I have struggled with adult acne and I have begun to use this soap twice daily with noticeable benefits. Leaves your hair nice and clean without feeling stripped.  I have very very thick coarse blond hair, and it makes it look so nice.  This soap is a staple in our home now, bye bye to all of the other brands!</li>
    <li> As a health nut and beauty junkie, I honestly look forward to using this product every day.  It has a great, musky scent and leaves my skin feeling nourished.  It&#x27;s great for the entire family too, from the adults in your house to the kids--even dogs!  If you&#x27;ve not tried body brushing, I highly recommend doing it prior to using Dr. Woods products.  In doing this, your skin will look and feel better than it ever has before.  (That&#x27;s been my experience anyway!)</li>
    <li> I love it! Leaves face smooth and soft without drying or harshness.</li>
    <li> I really like this pruduct its mild and smells great.</li>
    <li> Awesome helps with dry skin. Came earlier than expected. Nice</li>
    <li> I have been using the soap exclusively to wash my body for a couple of years now. Highly recommended. Doesn&#x27;t suds up that much, but that&#x27;s normal. I don&#x27;t use that much (I really only use soap to wash my armpits and, err, private parts) because I really don&#x27;t believe in using soap for the rest of your body when simply water will do (protect your microbiome!) so each of these 32 ounce bottles last me nearly a year.</li>
    <li> Nice quality soap. Foams well and leaves my skin very soft afterwards.</li>
    <li> Trying to find a good paraben-free soap, I read up on Castile and tried Dr. Bonner&#x27;s (ordered from Amazon).  After reading the reviews on Dr. Woods soap I decided to give it a try.  Is just as good as Bonner&#x27;s and the price can&#x27;t be beat.  There is nothing unpleasant about the scent and it makes a rich lather with a lather-building bath pouf.  However, it&#x27;s not a good shampoo, at least for long thick hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. I have terrible acne and use it as a facial scrub and it always takes care of the scarring left behind.</li>
    <li> Liked this so much after using while on holiday at a friends home I wanted to buy for personal use at home. Great product and pricing is relatively reasonable too.</li>
    <li> Smells great, I have used it in a variety of ways and will keep purchasing castile soap instead of all the other soaps I used to buy.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff, although it is runny and a little watery. It runs out fairly quickly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this soap for two days, and let me tell you, I noticed a difference from the first use. This stuff removes the excess oil from your skin, while leaving a silky smooth coat of moisture behind at the same time. My face STAYS smooth way after I&#x27;ve used the soap, and so far my face doesn&#x27;t get oily again right away for a long time after using it. I&#x27;ve had a problem with face washes drying out my skin and then causing my skin to release even more oil, further worsening the problem. This stuff does not do that. It just removes the oil and replaces moisture in a way that does not appear to clog pores. It also feels really nice as a body wash and leaves all my skin smooth, not just my face. I&#x27;m hoping can clear up acne on the shoulders too, but its too soon to tell. Clearly, my face is benefiting, which is a huge deal, because nothing has really worked before, and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of stuff over the years. This can also be used a shaving soap, and provides a smooth shave. It foams just enough to be able to see the soap, but not too much. I&#x27;ve used it as a conditioning shampoo too, and I&#x27;ve had interesting results. It seems to clean my hair, but not strip the natural oils out, like I have noticed with other commercial shampoos I&#x27;ve used. Because of this my hair feels noticeably heavy, but doesn&#x27;t really feel like it weighs me down. It also seems to have more volume and not lay flat as much as before using the soap. I also follow up with Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil brushed throughout my hair as a natural conditioner and do discourage against frizz. This is the first hair care regime I&#x27;ve used outside of commercial products and my hair is NOT frizzing. It looks good. I am pretty blown away by how well this is working. I guess your hair can respond to natural stuff super well! The only thing that&#x27;s really been a negative is that since stopping regular store-bought conditioner, it is a little more difficult to brush through tangled hair. However, it is not impossible, and I think my hair will thank me for not using products that dry it out with sulfates and other ingredients like that. We&#x27;ll see how this work in the long term, but I&#x27;m pleased so far. It&#x27;s worth it for me to spend a little more on a bottle of this than buy separate body wash, face wash, shampoo, conditioner, and shaving creme. It really simplifies my life and takes off some stress I didn&#x27;t realize I had so much of from having to keep up with five separate products. I&#x27;m so glad I found it and so thankful for the informative reviews people left on Amazon before I bought this soap.</li>
    <li> Great for the skin.  Amazon has best price anywhere.</li>
    <li> Omg this is seriously the best soap EVER. Its my shower gel and my shampoo. Totes amazing and highly recommended. It even smells awesome! The shea butter makes it slightly moisturizing, which is necessary for those of us with hard water... but it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling creamy or over-moisturized. Very well-balanced.</li>
    <li> I use this as a facial cleanser and body wash, I love it! My skin is so soft and clear, just beware if you&#x27;re using it on your vagina ladies...</li>
    <li> Great soap, smells nice and lathers well. Will definitely order again.  It promises to heal skin of blemishes and fine lines but I don&#x27;t put too much stock in that.</li>
    <li> I prefer Dr. Wood&#x27;s over Dr. Bronner&#x27;s any day. While Dr. Bronner&#x27;s would leave my skin dry, Dr. Wood&#x27;s has the shea that moisturizes my skin and hair while cleaning it. I find that I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner anymore, and use moisturizer for my skin only minimally.   I&#x27;ve tried the Almond version of Dr. Wood&#x27;s (which smelled more like candied almonds) and prefer the Black Soap to it. The smell of the Black Soap is somewhere in between licorice and rose, and while that sounds weird, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed the scent. It&#x27;s neither masculine nor feminine (my boyfriend has started using it also) and I just love the smell.   The Black Soap also seems to be a little thinner than the Almond (closer to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s).  I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant difference in my skin except for it being softer -- though I never really had any skin problems to begin with.    The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this soap is when I ordered it from Dr. Wood&#x27;s (DAB Unlimited), it took forever for them to ship it. I sent them an email a week after I ordered it asking why they hadn&#x27;t shipped it yet and they never emailed me back. It wasn&#x27;t until I filed a claim two weeks after I ordered it that they sent it and I received it the next day. There was no explanation as to why it took so long, and by that time I have already ordered another bottle from another seller.   But having two bottles of this soap isn&#x27;t the worst thing in the world. :)</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am prone to seasonal eczema and skin problems because of additives and perfumes. This product is so gentle and the fragrance is natural and does not irritate my skin at all. I use it on my face and body. Love it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this soap. The fact that you can use it for so many thing also appeals. I started using it on my face, and I will say, for anyone using it, note that it is a clarifier which means it will bring any \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; below the surface out. It was like I&#x27;d had a facial and all the stuff started coming out for like the first week and then all of a sudden my skin just cleared up. I don&#x27;t really have to use moisturizer with it. My skin is soft and radiant. It works great on your hair and also as a body wash.</li>
    <li> It unbelievable how good this soap makes my hair feel! Best shampoo ever for my hair! I told my daughter about it and she said it made her hair feel so soft! She have very course hair! I will Ck to see if they have any conditioners or leave in products  I can use with it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is it&#x27;s to liquidy (is that a word) comes out to fast.</li>
    <li> This soap leaves my skin really soft and I have noticed a decrease in dry itchy skin.  The smell is a bit different but I really like it.  My only complaint about this is that it is a bit awkward to use in the shower.  I pour it into a pump bottle to make it easier to use.</li>
    <li> Great size for the money. Definitely has the scent of black soap, however it leaves a texture immediately after that I can only describe as &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t really prefer that feeling, I prefer a softer feel. However, and ultimately, I might buy it again. Time will tell, and there&#x27;s certainly enough product to pass the time.</li>
    <li> Great stuff and was received in good order.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap. He uses on his hair and body and he is scrubbing his way through his 4th bottle. Smells fresh and clean, long-lasting, dispenses easily. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  It leaves my skin so smooth, soft, and smelling wonderful.  It even works as a 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner on my dry hair.  Very economical product as it can be very effective even when diluted.</li>
    <li> I have used this product along with shea oil on my scalp for a month to control my eczema and i have had no luck. I had read one review that said it is very moisturizing for a shampoo that they did not have to use conditioner.....NOT true at all. it made my hair feel so gross and i couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through it. My hair is shorter that shoulder length!  Also i used it for a face wash. I have never broken out so bad that i can remember so i thought maybe it was just cleaning it out and it would clear up....no such luck it just made my face oily and broken out :(  i would not recommend this to anyone. If anyone knows of anything that actually works it would be good to know.</li>
    <li> Smoothes your skin while clearing away blemishes!</li>
    <li> Did not like it as we&#x27;ll.  I ordered another product and it was out of stock, I tried this one and I did not like it.</li>
    <li> i Love this soap, it make you feel so clean and fresh, well be ordering more. I didnot Have a problem with it at all.</li>
    <li> Use this stuff for everything. Shaving, hair wash, face wash, and body wash. Leaves my skin feeling great and my body feeling clean.</li>
    <li> I prefer Dr. Woods over Dr. Bronners because it doesn&#x27;t dry my hands out.  I dilute and use as handsoap and when I used Dr. Bronners, my hands were so dry.  I also use this to wash my toddlers when they bathe, however, it burned a little on the sensitive parts so I stopped using it on them.  I do like the smell of this but probably will stick to buying the Baby Mild for the kids.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face clean and smooth. Will order again</li>
    <li> Smells no good... but still love it. Because it is very gentile and feel definately it is a naturally made.</li>
    <li> only soap I use.......Love it</li>
    <li> I lv lv lv this brand I use head to toe it being my first time. I just wish it smelled more of fresh clean scent it&#x27;s a little manly for but still lv it</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff..</li>
    <li> I was just window shopping, I bought this from a different site, when I run low I&#x27;ll buy it here. I have discoid lupus, which is skin lupus, I&#x27;ve had it on skin and scalp and nothing helped.. I could use Head and Shoulders, but lots of chemicals there. This soap has none of that. The first thing I noticed is the lack of reaction my skin has to this product, the second is unless I develop problems, I&#x27;ll keep using it. I love that its a true head to toe soap, squeaky clean without scrubbing my skin off, very nice, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for something gentle and more natural.</li>
    <li> This works great for my daughters ezcema!  I love it</li>
    <li> This soap is no good and I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I  use it all the time to clean my face and my bathroom.</li>
    <li> As someone with incredibly sensitive skin, I was really wary of trying this soap. My friend bought it and let me try a little bit. I loved it so much that I got a bottle of it for myself. I have cystic acne and because of that, I have a lot of acne scars. I&#x27;ve only been using this soap for a week and I&#x27;m already noticing my scars are fading and I haven&#x27;t had a pimple either. At first I didn&#x27;t like the smell, but I&#x27;ve grown to like it. Highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week since receiving it and I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has been great at cleaning my face and body!</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS 32 OZ. BOTTLE A 2 DAYS AGO, WHICH WAS 3 DAYS BEFORE THE ESTIMATED DELIVERY TIME. I USED IT AS A FACE WASH &amp; IT&#x27;S FREAKIN GREAT!!!! IT LEFT MY VERY SENSITIVE, DRY SKIN VERY CLEAN &amp; SOFT. USUALLY, RIGHT AFTER I WASH MY FACE, IT&#x27;S VERY DRY &amp; FLAKY, BUT IT WAS SO SOFT WITH NO FLAKING!! &amp; THIS IS AFTER THE FIRST USE! ALL YOU NEED IS A LITTLE PEA SIZE IN YOUR HAND &amp; IT LATHERS VERY WELL. I&#x27;M NOT GOING BACK TO MY LAST FACE WASH. IT SMELLS VERY CLEAN &amp; WOODSY. I LOVE IT &amp; I&#x27;D RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE! I&#x27;VE NEVER HAD BETTER, PLUS IT&#x27;S GONNA LAST ME A FEW YEARS! LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only soap I use in the shower.  It works for my sensitive skin, smells great, and moisturizes.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so silky soft after I use this soap.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like my skin.  No chemicals all natural is a big plus.</li>
    <li> I use this soap in the shower after workouts. After turning 50 my skin started getting sensitive to whatever they put in commercial liquid soaps. I saw this product at VitaCost when buying supplements and decided to try it. I have been using it for a month and my skin irritations from soap have stopped. The smell is a little different but is not bad, more like a natural smell, and it doesn&#x27;t linger on all day. It lathers up well enough for showers and my skin is not as dry. I like it and plan on using this product for the long term. It is cheaper than the store brand liquid soaps, but like all this stuff, shipping makes it a little more expensive, but it is still worth it to me.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I have severely dry skin and rarely use perfumed soaps as I find them drying. This has a wonderful scent, like a mildly spicy sandalwood, and is gentle enough to even use as a shampoo. I wash delicates and sweaters with it, and enjoy the lingering scent. A bottle lasts a really long time! I filled a pump bottle for the shower, and use it with every shower.</li>
    <li> Good product for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Good quality soap. But the smell is a bit too strong for me.</li>
    <li> Soap is awesome for acne. Dries you up and works within hours! I&#x27;d recommend! If you wand a solution for your acne- buy it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 2 weeks and so far I really like it. It seems to be very gentle on the skin. I use it along with an Olay facial cleansing brush. As a moisturizer, I use Emu Oil. My face is as soft as a new born baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> The only soap I use in the shower. Cleans, deodorizes, moisturizes and smells great. Far better than using poisons you get at salons and Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite soap. I&#x27;ve also used Dr. Woods Peppermint (which is more mild than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s). I love the smell of the soap. I use it for everything: cleaning, body wash, face wash, an ingredient in home made shampoo, dish soap, hand soap, dog shampoo. It&#x27;s really mild, doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin (I never need lotion anymore), and has smoothed out my complexion. I make it last extra long by filling 1/4 or less (to your preference) of an old foam pump bottle with this soap and the rest with water. It foams the soap really nicely and extends the life of the bottle a long way. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by a friend and I love it. I use it as face wash daily and have used it to shave. Works great for both. I like the herbal scent, but it might be a little off-putting to those who like sweeter or more floral scents.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I&#x27;ve never been able to say that before and I&#x27;ve tried everything, even resorting to Rx soap (which may have been the worst). At best soaps have not irritated, had ingredients I&#x27;ve read good things about, or have smelled nice - I liked Dr B Peppermint for a while. This Dr Woods soap has all three, plus it is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that is an excellent cleaner and makes my hands SOFTER after washing. It feels very rich and needs only a tiny bit to lather up real good.&lt;br /&gt;I could never say that a soap prevents my skin from drying because I have to wash my hands too frequently at work. In truth, due to its very nature, no matter what is claimed by manufacturers, no soap can prevent or cure dry skin because oil or lotion with oil is necessary to do that. But this is absolutely the only soap that doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of moisture with each use. My hands are no longer raw and I don&#x27;t have to rush for the moisturizer every time I wash them.&lt;br /&gt;As a body soap it gets even better reviews as my whole family loves it because it feels so luxurious. It is thick enough to soap up each area like bar soap so you feel real clean without ending up pouring liquid soap on the floor of the tub!&lt;br /&gt;A note re the smell, some people don&#x27;t like it, but we do. It smells clean and soothing to us and also doesn&#x27;t follow you around all day.&lt;br /&gt;Although this has become a cliche in positive reviews, I really am so happy to have found it.</li>
    <li> Best soap ever!  Great mild fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;No residue not drying . Economical.&lt;br /&gt;Why add perfume and deodorant to your soap to wreck your skim. Pure.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this over a year ago in hopes to help my face acne, but I also decided to try it as a body wash. I definitely wasn&#x27;t initially impressed with the runniness or smell. I tried it with a body puff for my body and with a Clarisonic for my face. After a few months I gave up because I wasn&#x27;t seeing any improvement with my face acne or bacne (I&#x27;m talking cystic and EVERYWHERE). My face seemed to be getting to dry and irritated, so I blamed the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward a few months, and I randomly came across the reviews for the Salux Japanese Body Cloths and immediately gave into the hype and bought a set of three. They&#x27;re so cheap! Also randomly, I saw a reviewer mentioned they used them in conjunction with Dr. Woods Black Soap for their body. I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose since I was struggling with nasty skin on my back and constant ingrown hairs on my legs, and I had this massive 32 ounce bottle with about half still left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not kidding when I say that the results were almost instaneous. Within a week my bacne was completely clear! Do you realize that I have struggled with this issue since pretty much puberty, and no amount of prescribed meds ever cleared it up. The skin on my entire body is so flippin&#x27; soft, as in baby soft. I literally rub my hand over my back a dozen times a day because it&#x27;s NEVER been pimple-free and this soft EVER. My mom says as a baby I had shark skin, so I apparently didn&#x27;t even have baby soft skin when I was a baby:/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the face. Hrmph...I&#x27;m still struggling with this area and finally gave myself up to the professionals. However, I decided the Clarisonic was the cause of my irritation. So I ditched it long ago.  In the past month Dr. Woods is getting used from head to toe. I&#x27;m exfoliating my face ever so gently with the Salux cloth every other day with the soap, and I will say my face is feeling much softer and not irritated. I may reduce that ritual to only a couple of times a weekso that i don&#x27;t over exfoliate. The face acne is hanging around with a vengeance, but my derm switched up my meds recently. I only get acne on my cheeks, but the rest of my face is very smooth and even looking since using the black soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t hesitate to try this soap. I would abosutely recommend it as a life-changing body wash (and I would definitely say the extra things that make it work are the Salux cloths). As a face soap, I have faith that it&#x27;s helping, but I&#x27;ll try to remember to give an update after prolonged use. For those who complain about the smell, you do get used to it, and the odor doesn&#x27;t stick around after it&#x27;s rinsed off.</li>
    <li> Excellent product have used  black soap for a few years now, however  using it in liquid form is great. Good for anyone but had especially helped with my son who suffers from eczema. Great  clean suddle scent as well</li>
    <li> I had tried other products, but this one, I was lost when it was not available at my local store, and my husband and I looked for it and found it here. It smells clean, leaves no film on you or your bathroom (great if you have to do irt your self!) And feels really clean after showering.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for the face and gentle to the skin. I love it!</li>
    <li> Skin felt so smooth after using this...I&#x27;m not too sure how effective it was with skin issues since I was using it with other products, but it definitely didn&#x27;t hurt and I did like the fact it moisturizers your skin.</li>
    <li> Some other commenters didn&#x27;t like the fragrance.  I like it, but is definitely more woodsy rather than floral.  I have pretty sensitive and dry skin.  This soap has been great for me as a body wash.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr. Woods&#x27; black soap for approximately 2-3 months and I can honestly say that my hair and skin feel so much better.  I have extremely sensitive skin that breaks out no matter what I put on my face and not only does the black soap controls my breakout; if I do have minor breakouts - it gets rid of them quickly! And the best part - no scars are left behind! My overall complexion is healthy and smooth!  I have recommended this product to my family and friends!</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower and in hand soap dispensers. I like the soft fragrance and I feel clean after I use this product. I also like the fact that I am not putting chemicals on my skin that aren&#x27;t even necessary when cleaning your body.</li>
    <li> This is now by far my favorite soap. It helps with skin irritation, and I like the way it smells.</li>
    <li> good soap but definetly can dry skin if you are sensitive to dry skin.</li>
    <li> the smell is a little strange for me, but still acceptable; the hair seems to be smoother and softened after using this product</li>
    <li> I love this soap. The smell is amazing! Bothmy husband and I can both use it. Enough lather but not too much and makes my skin feel great! A little goes a long way:)</li>
    <li> This stuff really does clear acne! I was skeptical because of all of the &amp;#34;lotions &amp; potions&amp;#34; on the market today claiming to clear up blemishes but I feel as if I&#x27;ve tried them all and nothing has worked  (until I tried this that is!) Makes my hair feel super soft and is great in the bathtub too!</li>
    <li> This soap is just a little over priced. The quality is very high however.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say, but this gave my skin the worst possible outcome - made it worse!&lt;br /&gt;I know I have sensitive skin, so I thought this would be good for it and there are a lot of positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;But for some reason, this dried out my skin terribly, caused it to have some kind of rash-like reaction, and made my casual zits into swollen cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would warn people with highly sensitive skin. Sad this did not work for me...</li>
    <li> A little on the thin side, but cleans my skin well. I use natural oils on my skin and like a soap that cleans of the oil completely so  there will be no build up. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it daily for mature skin and will dry skin that is already dry. Great for oily skin and acne. Now I&#x27;m going to purchase for my nephew that has very oily skin and acne. A great bargain.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe you guys like this product, and I&#x27;m sorry I was led to buy it.  So, I opened it up, and I was smacked by this NASTY horrid perfume stench.  I looked in the ingredients to figure out what the heck would be in this natural, hippie product that would smell so bad - my sensibility is to LIKE most essential oils and hippie products&#x27; smells and things like that - so I wondered what could be in this stuff that made me want to puke like sniffing Pantene or Fructise or Axe body spray or some horrid crap like those mainstream products - and SURE ENOUGH, this product has PERFUME listed in the ingredients.  If you LIKE gross perfume, you might like this, but my guess is, you&#x27;re looking for something that doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as shampoo from walgreens... because this is marketed as something \\&quot;natural\\&quot;... but it looks, from the reviews, as though y&#x27;all are effectively bamboozled.  I sure am pissed off that I bought it.</li>
    <li> This soap makes my skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom! I have not broken out since I have used this product, and that is saying a lot since I have always had some sort of active breakout on my face since I could remember. It works so well in conjunction with my Olay cleansing brush. My face really does feel fresh and clean after every wash. The only downside I can say is, if the tiniest little amount drips into your eye, oh gosh it will burn! But, I will continue to repurchase and I am so happy that I finally found a face wash that works for my skin :)if you are hesitate about buying this.. just do it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re into simple, crisp and effective cleasing without[[ASIN:B00397XUIK ELMA&amp;SANA Golden Argan Oil ® 100 Cold Pressed Virgin Organic Certified By Ecocert -1oz(30ml)]] soapy residue or pefumey smells this is your soap. I was suprised as I have very sensitive skin...no irritations. I must admit  that I mist argan oil on while slighty damp after my showers.My skin is smooth and clean. Im sold! Great soap</li>
    <li> Because this soap does exactly what all the best dermatologist say it does.  It helps keep a young teenage boy or girl&#x27;s acne cleared up.  No scarring is left behind and no over drying of their young skin.  I researched the best soaps for acne and looked for the best product I could buy, and this won out over all of the others that are on the market. With tons of high end products out there this one does the trick and does it better for less. I could actually see a significant difference within the first few days of use.  We are so happy with this product.  If you do any sort of research you will find black soap has been used for decades.</li>
    <li> This product is the best. My family loves it.  Great for cleansing blemished teen skin...aging adult skin...childs sensitive skin.  Gentle, natural, deep cleansing while moisturizing.  In every shower.  Love the clean, non-parfumed scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can be used on body and hair, but also as natural household cleanser...crazy, cool.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap.  I&#x27;ve used another brand before, but I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the smell or lather.  This soap has herbal, slight vanilla-creamy scent to me that I don&#x27;t find offensive nor does it clash with anything else I may put on. And the lather is good, and comparable to the castille soaps I used to use frequently.  It leaves my skin feeling smooth and not terribly dried out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a face wash, morning and night, and it seemed to clear my face up right away.&lt;br /&gt;Also been using this as a shampoo.  Does well in cleaning hair (I have ethnic/hispanic hair).  I get complimented all the time that my hair smells like coconut.  I enjoy the smell, it&#x27;s not purely coconut, but it is nice....definitely woodsy.&lt;br /&gt;On floors it does well.  I use reusable wash clothes on my floors.  If you do the same, make sure to wet and ring out the cloth first before using this product or your floors will feel a little greasy/slick.  I use vinegar first, then go over with the black soap.  Turned out very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good on counters as well.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely plan on continuing using this product.</li>
    <li> I have become allergic to shampoo!  Most shampoo makes me break out and this does not.  Plus, it make my hair look great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit drying on its own, even though it&#x27;s already diluted. Makes a great base for hand soap and face wash though.</li>
    <li> Very drying. I&#x27;ll stick to the black soap bar I&#x27;ve been buying at my local farmer&#x27;s market.&lt;br /&gt;I have to use way too much lotion to get rid of that harsh dry feeling after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;It never helped my eczema or acne.</li>
    <li> My hormone face seems to be clearing at record speed.  I have only been using it for 3 days, and I haven&#x27;t gotten any new pimples (which I should have at least 10 new ones right now) so I am quite hopeful that this is taking care of my pregnancy acne!!!  The smell is strangely chemically, but it doesn&#x27;t matter much to me because it doesn&#x27;t linger.  I will try to remember to come back in a couple of months if somethign weird happens :)</li>
    <li> Great soap!  My family loves this soap, just watch your eyes!  My face has not had any breakouts since using this soap.  I switched from cetafil mild face cleanser that I had been using for years.  I wanted to go natural and have never been happier.  I purchased a few 4oz glass pump bottles from amazon to use at different locations in the house and its easy to dispense and we all love this soap.</li>
    <li> The experience: Product is a dark amber/light brown color, watery and has a distinct smell that reminds me of Neutrogena body wash. It&#x27;s not aromatic or fruity, it just has a scent. You don&#x27;t need a lot of product, which is great. It doesn&#x27;t produce a lot of suds and bubbles, just enough to get the job done. I do feel that it does clean my skin very well and does not sting or burn. It has a slick feel to the skin afterwards which may be off-putting for some people because it may seem like the product needs a lot of water to rinse off. This product is good for people who have dry skin or sensitive skin. It comes in a big bottle so more bang for your buck. I also use it as a body wash sometimes and have no issues with it. My face is currently feels great and for some reason less oily by the end of the day. I use it with the Thayer&#x27;s rose petal/witch hazel toner, so I&#x27;m thinking its the combination of the two which has helped my skin.</li>
    <li> Good product.....like the rest in their line..... a little stronger cleanser than others I&#x27;ve used..... but has a nice fragrance to it....</li>
    <li> It has helped with my psoriasis, but I find the product a little runny. Also, by the time I&#x27;m washing my lower extremities I have to add more soap.</li>
    <li> Best stuff around, especially for psoriatics. I use it as shampoo as well, and even on my dog.</li>
    <li> I like it adds shine to my hair</li>
    <li> I have ordered this soap a few times now and really like the scent and feel of the soap. I dilute it with water and use it in a pump bottle at my kitchen and bathroom sinks. I prefer a more natural soap and one that is also not price prohibitive. The shipping is always great, too!</li>
    <li> This is my first black soap purchase. I use it primarily to wash my face in a solid effort to prevent breakouts. Wow, what a difference from average retail store products (i.e.: Neutrogena)! My face actually feels clean, and yet NOT dry. Furthermore, a little drop is quite effective; you do not need much, so I am sure this bottle will last awhile. Great product and worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I also use Queen Helen Mint Julep Masque in addition to Dr. Woods&#x27; Black Soap. These 2 products create the perfect skin regimen combination. I&#x27;ve noticed results relatively quickly; my chin is the most problematic part of my face (mostly unnoticeable yet irritating whiteheads), and it has cleared up for the most part!</li>
    <li> I started using this product for almost a year or maybe even longer. I also had my teenage son use it too since he has acne on his face. I must say, I am not breaking out, but I am also not seeing any dramatic changes as well. As for my son, I noticed that his face is a lot less oily, and his skin has gotten a lot clearer. Most importantly, my son and I did not break-out from this product, so that&#x27;s a good thing! Oh! I also wanted to conclude that it arrived faster than I had anticipated.</li>
    <li> I ordered this black soap because my cousin recommended it for body acne.  I love this soap, I have bought 3 extra bottles so that I don&#x27;t run out.  the only problem I have is I can not use it on the bottom portion of my face (my chin).  Since im constantly washing my face through out the day its to strong, or maybe I&#x27;m not use to it yet. but I love the clean feeling I get with this soap all over my body. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair yet and I don&#x27;t know if I will. but I will continue using this instead of regular soap. I have already told my family and kids about how great this soap is.  The order came quickly and with no damage.</li>
    <li> Great body wash!  This soap smells wonderful and leaves skin feeling clean, but not dry.  I highly recommend this product!  Now I can stop buying overpriced, artificial body wash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week, but I already know I&#x27;m going to be a lifetime consumer of Dr. Woods Black Soap. I originally purchased this to use as a facial cleanser, but started to also use it as a body wash, shampoo, and in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the facial cleanser aspect - all I gotta say is HALLELUJAH! I&#x27;ve used so many different cleansers and facial products, and none of them ever did what I wanted them to do. I&#x27;ve tried so many different products to get rid of these little bumps on my face (in addition to the pimples); I&#x27;ve even tried ProActiv. All that other stuff just dried out my face and never ended up helping. Plus, I needed to use make-up remover wipes to get rid of the make-up before using ProActiv. The biggest observation I made was that even after using the make-up remover wipes and first step of ProActiv, make-up would STILL come off when I used the astringent. That other stuff obviously wasn&#x27;t cleaning my face. But the black soap? It&#x27;s the only thing I need to use to clean my face. I use a witch hazel toner after washing my face with the black soap, and nothing ends up on the cotton ball after applying the toner, so I know my face is CLEAN. You know the acronym KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid - this is the epitome of simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the body wash aspect - again, a home-run. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed and wasn&#x27;t expecting was that my underarms are smoother after starting this product. Sorry if this is TMI, but no more irritation from shaving my underarms. I used to get the red bumps, but now it&#x27;s smooth. Again, it doesn&#x27;t try out my skin - just makes it feel clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo - I&#x27;ve only used it once as a shampoo, but I definitely noticed more volume. The one thing with using it as a shampoo is that I felt like I had to use a lot to get it to lather. Without a good lather, it was difficult for me to tell which parts of my hair actually had soap on it and which parts didn&#x27;t. But hey, that&#x27;s a minor issue. As others have mentioned, this product does tend to be &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34; compared to other soaps, but I&#x27;m cool with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soak for the tub - I guess you&#x27;d only use it as a soak if you like the smell, and I do like the smell. As others have noted, it&#x27;s a unique smell and I can&#x27;t really think of anything with which I can compare it. It smells clean and isn&#x27;t overpowering by any means...it&#x27;s just different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend that you at least try Dr. Woods Black Soap. I originally wanted to try this for two reasons - first, to get rid of the bumps on my face, and second, to try something made of natural ingredients. Boy oh boy, I&#x27;m never going back to lab-created chemical concoctions. This is the real deal. You can read every ingredient on the label. I am so thankful to have found this product!</li>
    <li> I love the product. I have been using it for years as a facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin. Started using this product and after a couple weeks I was able to see a difference in the appearance and texture of my skin. Now this is all I us. I swear by it.</li>
    <li> Amazing smell and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. In my opinion Dr. Woods brand beats Dr. Bronners on the moisturizing factor for sure. I&#x27;ve used the almond and it&#x27;s great, but I think I like the black soap more.</li>
    <li> Love the product!!  Use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> Love love love this soap!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE this! Despite what ppl say about the smell,  i love it!! I lovd the clean smell, i wash my face, body, hair! Awesome stuff!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It has such a unique natural smell. Can&#x27;t get enough of this amazing chemical-free body wash. Nice alternative to Dr. Bronners...</li>
    <li> This is the fifth bottle I bought this year as I gave them away to my family and they always about his competitor though good does not contain these enriching elements and oils</li>
    <li> I bought this to be used as a face wash for my entire family ages 11, 15, 18 &amp; 36. Within 2 days I noticed a significant difference in my teenager&#x27;s skin. We have incredibly sensitive skin yet none of us had any type of reaction to this soap. My skin feels soft &amp; clean after using, never dry or tight &amp; although it says exfoliating in the description there isn&#x27;t an actual exfoliating feel, nothing gritty or course. We use about a dime size amount and that&#x27;s plenty so this should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Just an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; product.  I did not finish the whole bottle and threw out the remaining soap.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I heard this was good for Sebhoric Dermatis (sp?) UGH! My scalp and face are coming off in sheets, not too mention that it flared up every dry skin patch on my body. Can&#x27;t believe the reviews, people must have oily skin.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin smooth and hydrated. Also helps to relieve the itchiness from psoriasis. I use it as a shampoo and a body wash...works wonders.</li>
    <li> This soap is very good but I like Dr. Bronners better. This soap is kind of thick so I have to use more of it I think.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> Repeat order...great stuff!</li>
    <li> This soap is gross,can&#x27;t compare this product with Dr.Bonners,I tried failed miserably</li>
    <li> Well i purchased this product a month ago an i can tell i use it just for my skin an it works really good with making yu feel clean an also smells good.. It made the blemishes i had on my skin fade. I need to purchase more bc im already out of it... lol.. all in all good product..!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE my Dr Woods Black Soap with Shea Butter!!! I used to use Dr. Bronners, but I have extremely sensitive skin which would break out. Ever since I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Woods Black Soap I&#x27;ve had no such problems. I use it as an all over in my shower. Great for face, body and even hair! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My family loves this soap. It cleans well without drying, because of the shea butter, I suppose. It smells great as well. We love the smell, and have gotten comments about it as well. My boys use it as shampoo, so the smell lingers in their hair. I definitely recommend this soap!</li>
    <li> I try to use only all-natural products on my skin. I tried this soap once and was totally hooked on it. Now it&#x27;s the only one I use. It has a clean smell without any added perfumes and foams up nicely when used with a &#x27;scrubby&#x27;. HIGHLY recommended.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, and I love this soap. It cleanses well without stripping your hair of the oils it needs, which is very important for those with curls. It adds enough moisture to keep your hair supple and happy-- you can feel the difference after rinsing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also fantastic for sensitive scalps. My boyfriend&#x27;s scalp used to break out a lot, but since he&#x27;s been using Dr. Woods it has cleared up significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t dislike Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, I definitely prefer this soap. It&#x27;s also cheaper!</li>
    <li> In light of going chem-free, this soap is great for the shower and it even describes itself for use on hair.  Costs half as much as the other competing brand, Dr. Bronner.  If you&#x27;re not a guy, then you may not like the smell.  In either case, the washes off quite easily and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No smell is a good smell, IMHO.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  I use it for everything face body hair when I want to. It makes me feel really clean and refreshed and it&#x27;s great on my face. I don&#x27;t really have an acne problem and always forget about it in general until I run out of my acne face wash.... well I don&#x27;t need any more acne face wash. This keeps my skin clean and blemish free.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for over a year and won&#x27;t use anything else! It smells a bit floral/sandalwood, but doesn&#x27;t linger heavily on skin. Both my husband and I use it daily- our skin is fresh, moisturized and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Too rich to use straight. Made my face break out. I mixed with some green tea, and face cleared right up. A little goes a long way! Love my new face soap now!</li>
    <li> my favorite soap.  Good mild smell, leaves skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Black soap definitely help remove my acne from my face. Will buy from this seller again. Make sure to buy this product if a person has problem with acne.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product.  I have been using this product for quite a while and I have been very happy with it. It makes my skin very soft and it has been good to help with minor skin irritations too.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it, in one of those foam soap dispensers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I am in love! The epitome of &amp;#34;squeaky clean!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I buy this montly, about 2 bottles.  It cleans my dishes, my clothes, my carpeting, my body, my face, my hair, and I use it as a bathroom cleaner.  It really helps save space under the counter!  I love Dr. Woods products.</li>
    <li> I love this product it is good for my skin, and fantastic in hard water suds lots of it. Would recommend to everyone</li>
    <li> super smooth simple soap.  no drying. no caking.  great cleaning.  it will strip anything/everything if used as a shampoo.  works with cold water too.</li>
    <li> This soap feels lovely, very rich lather.  It smells kinda woodsy, very masculine but I like it.  I have weird combination skin and normally get a really bad breakout once a month.  Since using Dr Woods black soap, I had no breakout, my skin is more even-toned and smooth to the point I could stop wearing face makeup, no BB, no powder, nothin!!  I always try to shop conscientiously &amp; this vegan, biodegradable cruelty free soap is my new standby.  Do your face a favor &amp; get it!!  A huge bottle will last a long time &amp; you really can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> This soap can pretty much do anything, and not only that, it is extremely effective at it.  The smell is subtle but nice and the clean feeling is unmatchable without over-drying.</li>
    <li> This soap is great!! Blows Dr. broners out of the water! Smells so nice too, for a man or woman!</li>
    <li> i have terrible hormonal cystic acne (im 8 months pregnant) ALL OVER MY BODY and this is the only cleanser that i have used that has helped!! all of the cysts are GONE! im so happy will repurchase for the rest of my life!!!!</li>
    <li> This black soap is very thin and runny. I personally just don&#x27;t care for it having used other brands in the past to compare too. I wash with it and then don&#x27;t feel clean so I end up using a second soap afterwards. I bought a 2 pack and will be sending the second bottle to the womens shelter in hopes someone there likes it better.</li>
    <li> so sure it is not a good shampoo ,i tried and my hair truned to be like wild straw and more oily after 1 day .&lt;br /&gt;but i also tried it as a shower soap and it worked wonderful!!doesnt dry the skin ,no residuel .and smells so fresh ,i love the scent alot more than most of the shower gel i have used ,its a natural scent and for that reason i will buy it again .</li>
    <li> Love it. Second bottle so far.</li>
    <li> The best black soap online.</li>
    <li> This porduct cleans my face, and keeps my pores clear of pimples.</li>
    <li> It really helps my dry skin. I live in a desert, so this is a miracle worker. The smell is not what I&#x27;m used to, but it grew on me. It actually kind of smells like root beer. Haha</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to the store-bought soaps and shower gels that have tons of added ingredients in them, many of which I can&#x27;t pronounce.  If you&#x27;re looking for a safe, effective, GENTLE soap, even for infants and pets, try this.  It cleans great and leaves you moisturized, not dried out.  Plus, for those like me who care about what they&#x27;re putting ON their bodies as well as IN them, you can feel comfortable using this.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap. The Black soap is the best style. I tried the peppermint one time and it was nice but still not as great as the black soap. This is the one soap that helps my skin better than any face soap. It&#x27;s tough enough for my oily skin and removes my makeup but doesn&#x27;t over dry my face out or make me break out. After I wash with this, I use my regular moisturizer and it&#x27;s perfect. I also use it as my body soap. I also use it for my backpacking/camping soap.</li>
    <li> I used some of my sisters, and liked how it make my skin look so I bought a bottle for myself. Shipped fast. Great seller.</li>
    <li> The best cleaner for your skin.  You can use it to clean with too!  I don&#x27;t use anything else.  I even wash my locs with it!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend Dr. Woods&#x27;s Black Soap.  This soap is literally the ONLY soap that I use on my hair AND my fair.  I use no other products whatsoever, because that is how much I enjoy and trust this product.  After washing my face with this soap, my face feels well exfoliated, and clean and tight and vibrant.  Honestly.  And my hair always feels great as well.  I have been using this product as the only product for my face and hair, for over TWO YEARS, and I don&#x27;t plan on changing that anytime soon.  I have short hair, so one of these bottles lasts me about two and a half months.  So for $13 a bottle, I am also saving a lot of money.  This is a solid five star product in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by the, I am fair-skinned, and have normal type of skin oiliness.</li>
    <li> Years ago I bought black soap for my daughter. It really seemed to help her very dry skin. So, when I start to suffer from dry skin I decided to buy some for myself. I&#x27;m not a liquid soap fan. But this seemed to be a good buy for the price. It has not disappointed. My skin is going back to its original soft and very  moisturized condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled about the scent of this soap, but I love how my skin feels.</li>

    <li> Love this stuff!  Makes my skin look and feel great!</li>
    <li> Decided to switch up my skincare regimen &amp; came across this liquid black soap &amp; figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I LOVE IT! my face is flawless bcuz of this soap &amp; I&#x27;ve been using it for only about 3 weeks. it does have a smell to it, but it&#x27;s not THAT bad...it does tingle a little and DO NOT let this soap get in your eyes (OUCHIE!!!) I definitely would recommend this soap to any1. I say try it &amp; see if it works for u. ordering my second bottle now actually</li>
    <li> I chose this based on reviews that i read. The product is good but now i prefer solid black soap.But yes i would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Makes skin really soft but when I used it as a cleanser my face is extra oily and I did notice some breakouts.</li>
    <li> This soap is great.  Although it does leave one smelling like turpentine, it is a manly smell.</li>
    <li> Use this soap as a makeup brush cleaner... if you think the liquid foundation does not come off using whatever product you normally use, think again.. believe you me, it takes one wash and all the product comes off and make the brushes look like they were the first time you bough them.. and like the rest of em here, i use it for my face too.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m almost halfway through my second 32 oz. bottle.  The acne scars on my forehead have yet to disappear or even fade noticeably. So that&#x27;s a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent of this, and that it&#x27;s all natural, and that the bottle lasts me a little over a month (that&#x27;s with full body use and 5 -7 squirts per shower).  These are the reasons I&#x27;m going to continue buying this product.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes for better or worse in my skin from using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody, unless they specifically said they&#x27;re looking for a cheap organic soap that will last them a while.</li>
    <li> dr. woods black soap smells so good, and it also moisturizes my skin, unlike many other soaps (bottle and/or bar) i&#x27;ve tried.  i like that the ingredients are organic, and that there are several ways to use this product.  i buy the 32oz size because i know i will continue to use it and want to make sure to have it on hand!</li>
    <li> Awesome! My husband has very sensitive skin and this is only soap he does not mind using it.&lt;br /&gt;It never dried up your face but cleans so well!!&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin or acne try this soap.</li>
    <li> Love this all over soap</li>
    <li> Now there are tons of grand claims about every skin product on the market. Most say that they will clear your skin up and leave it looking smoother than ever. Well, this soap won&#x27;t do all that. I am not going to tell you that it&#x27;s going to give you skin you never had because it&#x27;s just...not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT...I love this soap. I have sensitive skin, so before I gave this a try I was using (and swearing by) Cetaphil. And if you know your skin cleansers, Cetaphil is one of the most gentle &amp;#34;soaps&amp;#34; out there. Well, my skin must have changed within the past year (due to stress or hormones or whatever) because Cetaphil just wasn&#x27;t doing it for me anymore. I started to have breakouts along my jawline that just wouldn&#x27;t go away. So I began searching for an alternative...something safe and natural that has slightly more &amp;#34;punch&amp;#34; than Cetaphil. Luckily I stumbled upon a review on here for another product that mentioned Dr. Woods Black Soap and it has been a savior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately on first use, I noticed how MUCH makeup the Cetaphil cleanser was leaving on my face. I don&#x27;t use a ton of makeup, just powder foundation and blush, but I must have been leaving half of it on my face at night. Dr. Woods fixed that issue without me having to scrub my face raw doing it. Back to the pimple issue...I am not sure exactly when they started clearing up, but it couldn&#x27;t have been long after I started using this product (or I would have stopped and tried something else...I have little patience). It seemed too good to be true, and I kept waiting for the pimples to return. But they didn&#x27;t. And honestly, I haven&#x27;t had fewer issues with pimples in my life. I get the occasional back pimple as well, so I started applying it to those areas before jumping in the shower. Boom, they went away. Now, I don&#x27;t want to say that this product will work miracles for everyone as I have never had &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34;, just the occasional few here and there. And everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so what works for me might not work for you and vice versa. But if you are struggling to find a different product to try, I would definitely give this a shot. It might just blow your mind.at works for me might not work for you and vice versa. But if you are struggling to find a different product to try, I would definitely give this a shot. It might just blow your mind.</li>
    <li> This is only my second Dr. Woods purchase.  I love this stuff even more than the first!  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of natural black soap as a bath soap and shampoo. I have natural hair so black soap is perfect for that. I decided to try a liquid version and Dr Woods popped up. Man...this stuff is amazing! My hair and skin LOVES it. It has a light natural smell...I can only describe it as a light woodsy fragrance but its really nice. And no film left behind. Your body and hair literally feels clean and best of all moisturized! I also have sensitive skin so all of Dr Woods products are great for that. Also the price is awesome! I went ahead and bought two other products from Dr Woods. Definitely a faithful customer!</li>
    <li> THE BEST BLACK SOAP EVER ! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS AMAZING QUALITY AND PRICE  !</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have tried about six different brands of black soap, ranging from other liquids, to processed bars, to the raw block.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it, and I love the smell!</li>
    <li> I love Bronner&#x27;s but wanted to give this a try.  The description sounds nice; indeed, the ingredients are great.  My 3-star rating is just from personal preference, though not a stab at the product itself: I think it smells weird.  But that&#x27;s that.  It works just as well as Bronner&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> and doesn&#x27;t seem to later much at all. I know that is not the benchmark for getting clean, but I just don&#x27;t seem to feel as clean as with other products. Low price for a big bottle which is good as you have to use a lot each time. One and only buy for me. If you&#x27;re a black soap fan there are other lines out there, such as Nubian Heritage that I find far superior (with a premium price as though).</li>
    <li> Too strong and irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the only non-soapy cleanser which makes me fell as if my skin is being cleansed.  The fragrance is soapy, not fruity, odorless, or even overly manly like Old Spice.  Its not the pleasantry of fragrance, but its soapy and does not linger on my skin for the whole day.</li>
    <li> great skin cleanser. I have tried any things to remove my acne and blemishes even prescriptions and it amazed me that this bottle was the answer! Where were you in high school! My skin is at its best with this soap.  I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Was delivered as stated and was wrapped to prevent leakage.</li>
    <li> Good things shouldn&#x27;t really remain a secret, especially when it comes to a natural product like this one. I bought my bottle of Dr. Woods Shea infused African black soap around a month ago and have used nothing else on my face or body. I&#x27;ve had amazing results! My skin is literally radiating light- I know it is when I see my reflection on my computer screen when it&#x27;s turned off and my face seems to be lit! To start with, I have combination skin that turns dry in Winter that my clarisonic took care of till it started to really dehydrate and sensitise it, I&#x27;ve packed it until Summer since. I use a small amount of this African soap twice a day and massage it into my skin for 30 seconds to a minute and use a light moisturiser right after drying my face. Although my skin feels squeaky clean, I know that it doesn&#x27;t completely take off makeup, atleast the long wearing kind, but a good clean up with a makeup removing wipe before using this liquid soap sorts that out perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews here I was expecting a masculine smelling citrusy fragrance, but I found the smell to be like a fresh mix of honey and almonds (I&#x27;ve used soaps like that), and I find it refreshing. On my body, I find that my skin has become more even toned- like what an alpha hydroxy cream would do. I will be buying another bottle when this one runs out!</li>
    <li> My favorite soap. But I found somewhere cheaper. Sorry.</li>
    <li> A shower essential in my house, my SO uses as a body wash, shampoo and beard wash. I love the way it smells on him , it has a light earthy smell. It is very moisturizing and I use it a few times a week as a facial cleanser as it is gentle and I love the way the shea butter leaves my skin feeling.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Great company.  Made sure I was happy right away. Wonderful soap too.</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s really good, skin feels really clean after using it but it also makes my asking really dry. Not sure if I want that everyday. Guess where you live matters too. I live in a dry place am guessing if you were in a really humid place it work perfectly</li>
    <li> The properties of this soap are phenomenal. I love what it does to my skin. For the past 10 years (I&#x27;m now in my 40s) I&#x27;ve had acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve tried everything: Neutrogena, Noxzema,  Clean &amp; Clear, Clearasil, Zapit and yes of course I tried Proactive - all of them were a waste of money! It wasn&#x27;t until I began researching natural cleansing products that I came across &#x27;black soap&#x27;. I am African American and the use of this soap has transformed my skin. It&#x27;s beautifully flawless. I only wear eyeliner, mascara and lipgloss/stain. Gone are the days of trying to find a foundation for caramel - colored skin with yellow undertones (gheesh...it doesn&#x27;t exist). I&#x27;m delighted with this product. Thanks Dr Woods!</li>
    <li> I really like how natural this product is and it does work great, however the scent reminds me of cheap laundry detergent.  I won&#x27;t buy this again because of the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple years and its all I now use on my face, hair, and body. I have tried Dr Bronners but it left my 2b hair like straw. With Dr Woods I have stopped using hair conditioner and my hair is silky, and all my special facial cleansers are collecting dust. Over time, blackheads have cleared up, and my normally combination skin is now balanced. I have no more need for face cream or body lotion most of the time. (Except occasionally in the winter) This soap is amazing and it&#x27;s great to have one bottle replace or eliminate the need for many other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the earthy clean smell. If I want to smell like flowers, that&#x27;s what my perfumes are for.  My husband has also been using this as his all-in-one cleanser and has commented on how nice his skin and hair feel as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make the huge 32 oz bottle more manageable, I bought a pump that fits the bottle perfectly for under two bucks from Sally Beauty Supply.</li>
    <li> Great lather, smells good and rinses clean with no residue.  It cleans the skin without drying it.  A little goes long way.  This is comparable to Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Organic sopas.</li>
    <li> Love this product and have been purchasing it for years now.  I switched to the tea tree a bit ago but it just doesn&#x27;t do the same job.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  I think the smell is heavenly.  It makes a refreshing face wash.  It is also wonderful for general house cleaning.  I scrub my floors with this and my entire house smells fresh.  It does not lather quite well enough to work for shaving, but it has so many other uses that it doesn&#x27;t matter.  The price is also very great for this quality item.</li>
    <li> This soap is awesome!  I use it as shampoo, face wash, body wash, hand wash, sometimes I do the dishes with it.  It&#x27;s awesome, gentle, smells great.  I had used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s regularly prior to purchasing Dr. Woods.  I would say that Doctor Woods is better for use on the body since it feels much gentler.  I prefer Dr Bronners for stuff like doing the dishes or washing the cat.</li>
    <li> Love this soap, there is nothing bad to say about it.  Very moisturizing, no lingering scent to clash with your perfume, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry.</li>
    <li> Just ordered a second bottle.</li>
    <li> A great quality product that leaves you smelling great!!! no harmful chemicals</li>
    <li> Like the soap itself but HATE the smell. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again because of the odd smell.</li>
    <li> The only soap I use.  My skin no longer feels irritated and dry.</li>
    <li> Rich lather, pleasant fragrance and great moisturizer. A nice natural soap.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product...Love it!</li>
    <li> I am a perpetual user of this product. I have given many review and they are all the same, the product is awesome. I have been using this for 9+ months and I have receive compliments regarding my skin.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a long time.  It is great.</li>
    <li> If you want to smell like rotted plantain skin, buy this stuff.  Otherwise, I recommend dragonfly soaps at dfsoaps.com.  Their stuff smells great and is made with awesome ingredients.  Although this stuff has shea butter in it, it just smells awful.  I couldn&#x27;t even stand my own smell after using this stuff.  Gross.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the smell of this soap. It&#x27;s okay, but I feel like it leaves a residue on my skin (it&#x27;s noticeable in the shower, but not once I dry off). I have only used it as a body wash.</li>
    <li> So, I decided to try this out on a whim, and I am so glad that I did - this stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve been trying to cut down on products with unnecessary chemicals, which is why I chose this. One thing I noticed immediately: with regular body washes that are chock full of chemicals, I can&#x27;t really smell anything on my skin afterward. I&#x27;ll buy something like \\&quot;Strawberries and Cream,\\&quot; and I can smell the scent on the product, but after washing with it, the smell goes away and doesn&#x27;t stay noticeable on my skin. Dr. Woods, however, has a very nice \\&quot;earthy/woodsy/fresh-clean\\&quot; smell (which I love!) and after using, I can still smell that amazing scent on my skin - it makes me feel really clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the best thing about this soap are the ingredients - all of them are natural and easy to pronounce, so I feel like I&#x27;m doing my body good by using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have used this as both a body wash and a face wash. It states on the bottle that it can also be used as a shampoo, and even for washing dishes! I may give this a go as a shampoo just to see if it works for me, but I&#x27;m not too sure about using it on dishes or as an all-purpose cleaner. I guess the thought weirds me out a bit. But this is highly recommended as a body and face wash! Every time I step out of the shower I can&#x27;t help but smell my arms! This will probably end up as my regular soap.</li>
    <li> I love love love this soap. It leaves my skin amazingly smooth and I notice less wrinkling and acne !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed instant results the first time I used it. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Using natural products is important to me and I love this soap! I find the smell mild and pleasant, it lathers up well and does an AWESOME job at cleaning. I use this for both face &amp; body and it gets off all my makeup easily and leaves my skin feeling soft. The ONLY negative is that I have to be very careful while washing off my eye makeup with this because it stings like a b**ch! It&#x27;s highly unpleasant getting this around my eyes but I like it so much otherwise, I am willing to suffer through this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my 20&#x27;s I wasted hundreds of dollars on expensive skin care brands including various acne control and anti-aging products. Now I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and am finally achieving clearer, smoother skin using a regime of totally natural and INEXPENSIVE products &amp; supplements! (Other favorites include Acure Organics Brightening Facial Scrub, Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel, Kiss My Face Olive &amp; Aloe lotion, and Burts Bees Intense Hydration eye cream). I am embarrassed to think how much I spent on skin care over the years and wish I had known about this product much sooner!</li>
    <li> awesome all around product can use in your hair or your skin makes your skin and hair is very soft</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I was having a major breakout and this soap has been a huge help. I will continue to order, I also love the smell. Great product.</li>
    <li> Home staple! Great product. All natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;v been hooked on this for about a year now, my skin is SO soft!</li>
    <li> Not the greatest, it does get your body clean but I find that you have to use a lot, maybe my product was watered down, it leaves a scent that you would want to smell on a man, it&#x27;s not a very feminine scent.</li>
    <li> This product has did absolutely \\&quot;nothing\\&quot; for my skin. It has not produced moisture, alleviated dryness or decrease the itchiness of my skin in the least. I do not like the way that it smell and I could did with that if it provided benefits to my skin. I gave it three stars instead on one because I am sure that I can mop my floor and clean with this product. I will definitely find some use for the product. It was a good deal, getting 32 ounces for $11.00. I will research the item and find out what kind of household uses the product has. Some of the reviewers say that they have washed their hair with this soap. However, I will not waste my time washing my hair with this because it did not provide any benefits to my skin it probably will not do anything for my coarse, 4c, African American natural hair either.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for the price. I have been using for a few weeks and I find that the soap lathers well and has a pleasant smell. I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Love Dr Woods liquid black soap with organic shea butter.  Can&#x27;t imagine not usuing it.  It feels medicated but refreshingly fresh.  Cleans like no other product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Great for problem skin.</li>
    <li> Bad smell. I didn&#x27;t know liquid soap could go bad? I fell in love with the smell of this soap three years ago. Disappointed I cannot get a refund or return. Cannot use product. I feel I should get a replacement.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get why this had so many good reviews. I bought it on that basis because it has about ~200 reviews with a 4.5 star rating. And it wasn&#x27;t bad necessarily... but it wasn&#x27;t good. Basically, this is just a natural soap that acts like a normal soap. This isn&#x27;t more effective for acne than say, cetaphil for example. It&#x27;s just natural. So, don&#x27;t expect a high quality skincare item, but more like a cheap natural alternative for normal soap. I was using burt&#x27;s bees radiance cleanser with a bit of alba botanica mini peel added in. It helped in that it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but exfoliated it enough so that it minimized breakouts. I heard this was exfoliating so I gave it a try and bought this huge bottle. It&#x27;s definitely drying and not exfoliating. It also leaves a strange invisible film on  your skin afterwards. My skin went from being clear on the other routine to it&#x27;s normal slightly pimply state. So... no good. And now I have a crapload of it. So I&#x27;m using it to wash my shower, toilet and sink. At least it was cheap. But it doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype of the reviews.</li>
    <li> I bought this directly from vitacost.  I used this as facial cleanser, shampoo, body soap, and hand soap.  I bought this b/c I wanted something simple, effective, and multifunctional.  This had great reviews and I bought a bottle.  First, it DEFINITELY has a smell.  Not a horrible smell, but clean.  It&#x27;s a mix of floral, licorice, spice, and light musk to me.  It will not smell like typical commercially perfumed shampoo/soaps.  I think it is okay for what it is, but have noticed that the smell is not consistent.  This is my 3rd bottle and each has smelled slightly different.  What I do now is to open the next bottle to air out when i start using a new bottle.  If using as a shampoo, I would highly recommend a diluted vinegar rinse.  This gets out that tacky feeling from using castile soap to wash your hair.  This is the first castile soap that I have been happy with as shampoo, the others were too drying.  The diluted vinegar rinse makes the hair so silky and soft (the rinse should barely smell of vinegar, and once that is rinsed out there is no smell at all).  Lastly, I am happily using this as a facial cleanser.  Initially it was causing breakouts b/c I was also using my regular serums &amp; moisturizers.  I stripped down to just the soap, and moisturizer only as needed (now occasionally at night, even in winter).  Absolutely no problems as a body soap/hand soap.  Bottom line:  cleans great, use diluted vinegar if using as shampoo for soft clean silky hair, the shea is moisturizing so be careful about adding extra moisturizer, good value with simple ingredients.</li>
    <li> great soaps helps in clearing blemishes</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, buy it all the time. Great for camping because you can wash everything from dishes to laundry and of course your self.</li>
    <li> favorite soap ever... love Dr. Woods products and this is our favorite by far at my home!</li>
    <li> I love it. I miss smelling like cucumbers but this lasts and I feel squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> I recently received this product and used it this morning to wash my hair and bathe my skin. Sure smells good. I love when stuff smell natural and not full of chemicals. I have natural African American hair, and my hair felt soft and looked clean when I was finished. I like how gently it was on my hair and I also used it on my wash cloth as a body wash. My skin felt great as well.</li>
    <li> The company was very easy to work with! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is an economical alternative to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s. My babies have very sensitive skin, so finding a natural body wash that didn&#x27;t aggravate allergies, and was also in our price range, was fantastic. I noticed people didn&#x27;t like the smell, but I love it. I wear patchouli, and prefer things that have a more natural odor, so this is my new favorite soap.</li>
    <li> This soap is naturally moisturizing without all the chemicals.  Since we started using Black Soap in 2008, we no longer need to bother with body lotion...and I&#x27;m always getting compliments on how soft me skin feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We add it to a foaming soap dispenser so that it lasts even longer.</li>
    <li> This soap is cleansing and moisturizing. I have 4a/4b natural hair and I use it as a shampoo. It is not drying but it cleanses my hair.</li>
    <li> I was so excited after reading all the excellent comments. So, needless to say, I was like a kid on Christmas when my package arrived. HOWEVER, I have been using this product on my skin for a month to help with acne and I&#x27;m not so sure it&#x27;s even doing much. Then I started using apple cider vinegar &amp; tea tree oil on my face alone with the wash and THEN I started to notice a difference. BUT I attribute that to the ACV/tea tree oil! Basically, I&#x27;m just waiting for what&#x27;s left in the bottle to run out because I&#x27;m back on to finding the next best thing for my skin. Unfortunately, this wasn&#x27;t it! :(</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great.</li>
    <li> This works great for my skin ! Love it.</li>
    <li> First off, I love the scent. Very sensual, yet clean.&lt;br /&gt;Great for cleansing my skin and hair. I am part African American and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my curly locks. My acne scars seem to be fading and my skin is really improving. Will be purchasing again soon!</li>
    <li> This is the only soap I use now. It&#x27;s gentle and has a pleasant, natural scent and rinses well for that &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling. I even use it as shampoo if I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
    <li> Awesome soap. It gets your skin squeaky clean. I have acne and I think it has helped a bit with reducing the amount of pimples I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to not get this in your eyes because it stings like hell!!!</li>
    <li> Received when expected. I&#x27;m still getting used to the fragrance of it. It seems thinner than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soaps. Very pleased with the price. I did expect the bottle to be sealed for safety. Will try other fragrances when this is finished.</li>
    <li> I found this soap while looking for something years ago that helped with blemishes and adult acne that wouldn&#x27;t leave my chin for good. The first time I used it, it stung a little, and a couple more times, but it never stung after it cleared my face up. I could tell a difference the first time I used it, and although I use a few other higher end products, this is always in my shower, and always goes with me when I travel. I have recommended this to a few people, and given it as Christmas presents, and every single person has come back to tell me how great the soap is. One peiarson said it helped with her husband&#x27;s psoriasis (sp?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something about it is very healing. I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say soothing, like a serum, but it is healing. I&#x27;ve used this in the shower when I&#x27;ve had sunburn, or various scrapes and cuts, and it&#x27;s always seemed to, can&#x27;t think of any other word, heal the skin. The 32 ounce bottle will last me over a year. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love this soap!! Smells great and makes my skin so smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I like the smell, cleanliness, etc of this product. Have used it for more than 6 months but have just recently broken out with a rash that I&#x27;m hoping isn&#x27;t from this. The Dr will hopefully be able to tell!</li>
    <li> Love your soap!  Leaves skin clean, exfoliated and non drying!  Just a little dab is all you need per wash! Have not tried as hair shampoo as yet!</li>
    <li> I love this product. my husband always complains about the soaps I buy. he actually commented how much he loves this product.</li>
    <li> It smells really weird. I heard it&#x27;s really good but so far I haven&#x27;t seen any difference.</li>
    <li> I was surprised about how good the soap was.  It is less drying than Dr. Bonners soap, I use it more often than before.</li>
    <li> I like this product.&lt;br /&gt;May be smell is not the best, but I like after-wash feeling. Skin is not dried out; I don’t need to use any lotions after. I would by again this product or recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Pleasant fragrance and nice consistency. One of the few soaps I can use, as I have hand eczema in the dry winter months.</li>
    <li> After a use of more than a month, I am writing this review this product in general is good it cleanse your skin well, reduces blemishes, improves skin tone the only complain I have with this soap it makes your skin dry in-fact too dry. As a whole this is a good product, I would recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;Came back to give 4 stars, I think it&#x27;s unfair to give 3.</li>
    <li> I selected this product for the benefits of shea.  I was looking for a product that would gently clean and leave facial skin soft.  At first, it did leave my skin feeling soft.  But after a few morning washings, my face began to itch.  Let me state that I do not have sensitive skin.  So I caution those of you who do to be careful about using this product.  Opinions can differ as to the pleasantness of a smell, but this product does have a very strong, aggressive smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not throwing it in the garbage since the manufacturer said that you can \\&quot;use 4 parts water to 1 part Dr. Woods to clean dishes, floors, counters, and more!\\&quot;  Wow, a product for my face can be used to clean the floor?</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. My skin is so smooth and looks bright!</li>
    <li> I have *very* sensitive skin and this is my favorite soap for all the sensitive areas of my body. It does a great job. I still use a more scented soap under my arms though. It&#x27;s very gentle and I use it on my face in the morning and evening.</li>
    <li> Soap took a few days to get used to, but now I enjoy the smell. It doesn&#x27;t suds up the same as synthetic soaps, but it cleans well.  My skin feels tight and smooth after use.  I like the product and would use again.</li>
    <li> It does not clean my make up well; even though I washed it 2-3 times exfoliating towel with this soap, my make up was still there! So, i wont recommended for daily makeup cleanser. it is effective for body and face with no make up tho!!  GOOD for acne too!(helpd me get rids of most of the blackheads&amp;acne)</li>
    <li> Never have a complaint about the smell, and feels easy on the skin. Definetely recommend to anyone going full organic. Only used on hands so far. Also, works well with automatic dispenser.</li>
    <li> My favorite shower soap!!  It smells divine and is so gentle and moisturizing.  You can use this for shampoo too, so one convenient pump bottle can reduce shower clutter.  How do I love thee - let me count the ways!</li>
    <li> This soap is perfect for my son&#x27;s sensitive skin, and is also great for everyone in the house!</li>
    <li> This makes an excellent cleaning product!  I bought it to use as shampoo but found out I have sensitivities to some of the ingredients not listed online.  I followed the instructions on the bottle to mix water with the soap to make a cleanser, and I&#x27;m impressed by the results every time I use it.  Super simple and very effective on kitchen countertops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest drawback is the fragrance used to scent the soap.  It smells like synthetic lavender or flowers and is fairly strong.  It&#x27;s the only reason I don&#x27;t like using this product.  There&#x27;s no way I would&#x27;ve used it as shampoo as planned with this heavy fragrance in it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this!</li>
    <li> I like how the soap makes my skin feel, but the smell is way too strong for me!  I keep smelling it and it&#x27;s giving me a headache. It is not a &#x27;bad&#x27; smell per se, just too strong for me.  If you don&#x27;t mind strong smells to for it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product!  It leaves my skin soft and it cleared up my blemishes and dark spots within a week.  This product is highly recommended if you want clear skin.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a soap that I would not react to and this seems to be a keeper. I have graying curly hair with scalp problems and have used it on my hair with good results but seem to need conditioner as well to reduce the fizz.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I love to use African black soap as a combination face/bodywash because it&#x27;s non-drying and wanted to purchase it in a form that was easier to travel with than a bar. I just pour some into a travel size tube and am good to go! The scent is not as good as other pure African black soaps I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s a bit medicinal, but not too bad. It&#x27;s slightly thicker than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s in consistency but the lather is comparable.</li>
    <li> Even my boyfriend, who is not at all into skincare, loves this soap. We&#x27;re hooked on the woodsy smell and the fact that it is an all-natural, healthy product. We use it as a facial wash. I use it with my Clarisonic at night and by hand in the morning. It foams up really well, so you only need a dime-sized drop. My skin is crazy, combo, sensitive, acne-prone and has discoloration + scars, so this is not a &amp;#34;miracle worker&amp;#34; product for me—I don&#x27;t think that exists. Instead, I like this as a nice way to treat my skin right and keep it fresh and clean. It certainly doesn&#x27;t cause any more breakouts than I already get, so I will keep using it on my face! I bet it would be fabulous as a body wash as well.</li>
    <li> After 25 years of living and only washing my face with water I woke up one morning and decided it was time to start a skin care routine. I love this product. I have very dry skin that only gets worse in the winter months and sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to apply lotion as often as I need to (several times a day). I use this on my face and body and I love it. At first I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the scent but after a while it grew on me. It&#x27;s pretty watery, but I have never used a cleanser that after one use made my face feel so soft!  I use this on my body and my skin overall stays very hydrated and smooth, even if I skip putting on lotion. I will definitely keep using this product as it keeps my skin, smooth, hydrated, soft, and feeling great!</li>
    <li> This soap is the only thing that helps fight my blemishes! I love this product simply because I can use it for everything; a face wash and body wash.  It also is all natural which is a big plus.  I have been using it forever and It lasts a long time! Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading about how beneficial black soap is, but to be honest, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements to my skin. The smell is a bit too musky for me. It doesn&#x27;t suds up very well, but I&#x27;ve noticed that liquid soaps like Dr. Bronners don&#x27;t necessarily do that because they don&#x27;t add extra additives.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now in the shower, for my face, and even on my cats and dogs. Everyone smells awesome, my skin feels good, and it&#x27;s cheap and lasts a while!</li>
    <li> I love this!  Great for face and shower.</li>
    <li> Unlike many of the typical body soaps, this leaves your skin feeling clean! The fragrance is generic with no added scenes unlike most.</li>
    <li> I just love the way it leaves me smelling and feeling clean. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> This soap can be used for everything. It is great as an all purpose hand wash, a home cleaner or as body and face wash. It is gentle to the skin and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> This is the best! Its really big product and the price for it is very decent.i use this as body wash, hand soap,dish soap, shampoo and face wash.I made my own face wash with is mixed with tea tree oil, and let me tell you I had always struggled with acne and this sure made a difference by after 3 days of use! I love how it smells and how it makes my skin feel clean and smooth. No razor burns, no black heads and its fading my strech marks already! My pre-mature wrinkles are fading too. I&#x27;m so happy I got this I will buy again!! Never stop making this product it truly is a fountain of youth and a lot more!!</li>
    <li> This is amazing soap i feel this is even better than the coastal scents black soap  and the amount your getting for your money love love</li>
    <li> Our nutritional therapist recommended this product as being perfect for body wash and shampoo. As body wash, it&#x27;s perfect as is. For shampoo, I dilute it in half with water - so 50% soap and 50% water. My hair tends to dry out no matter what, so the dilution is perfect for keep the dryness at bay. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> We use this soap frequently and just turn my sister and friend onto this they love it.</li>
    <li> this soap is so good!!!!!!! it&#x27;s really good on your skin! no harsh scent! does the job!!!</li>
    <li> I was searching for an effective facial cleanser when i was pregnant that did not contain a bunch of harmful chemicals.  I have combination skin and break out a lot during pregnancy.  After doing some online research I decided to try this product and LOVE it.  I will not say this is a miracle product for pregnancy-induced acne (I am not sure anything is!).  But it kept things under control waaaay better than anything else I have tried during 3 pregnancies!  It keeps oil under control but never overdried my skin.  I have continued using it as a facial cleanser.  Note, it does not remove eye makeup very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this with my Clarisonic face brush which I definitely believe makes this more effective. Like this cleanser it is gentle but effetive.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I use for skin and as a shampoo. It has a nice clean scent and yes it can be considered masculine but not artificially so... I still love it and my sons love it. It does improve your skin tone. Amazingly, it is a nice shampoo for my 4C natural hair. it does NOT leave that dry chalky film that Dr Bronner&#x27;s leaves and I get it for HALF the price at v-i-t-a-c-o-s-t! Been buying it for a long time from there now. Half the cost I say with the same shipping incentive...spend $25, shipping is free. The 32oz bottle lasts a long time in my house and I usually buy 2 or 3 at a time. You will not be disappointed with this one (unless you are looking for a girly, artificially fragranced product). Also Dr woods has the same scent offerings as Dr. Bronner&#x27;s but the product in my opinion is better. Make sure that you are purchasing the soap WITH SHEA BUTTER!</li>
    <li> I use this to clean everything.  It can be used for cars, laundry, and I even take a bath/shower with it.  If you have grease from working on a car or if you have allergies at certain times of the year, this is a great fix. This is an everyday - can be used for everything - product.  Definitely worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> I bought this soap at an urging of a friend and I could not be happier with it! I have spent tons of money on expensive department store products for my face and this beats all of them! The bottle is huge and will certainly last me a very long time! Will definitely purchase again and continue to recommend to friends and family. My skin literally glows.</li>
    <li> Best soap ever. Have received compliments on the improvement of my complexion. Doesn&#x27;t smell that great though. Worth the trade, you can even shave with it. Smells a bit like tar based shampoo for dandruff.</li>
    <li> I like this soap a lot because it isn&#x27;t laden with tons of synthetic chemical and sulfates. I have sensitive skin and the natural ingredients in this soap doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. It is very mild actually, but does the job. I also use it in all my hand soap dispensers. It&#x27;s very economical and a bottle lasts awhile for me. The price on amazon is pretty good, but you can also get this on Vitacost for super cheap!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and also a lot of redness, especially on my nose. All other products leave my face irritated and my redness exaggerated (this is mainly to do with Lauryl/Laureth Sulfate ingredient youll find in most cleanses-foams up). No only is that ingredient eliminated, but Parabens are as well. The smell is strong, at first. Reminds me of the big, brick shaped soap bar of the same color, my grandmother use to use. After using it for almost two months, the smell is faint, even if it wasnt, I dont care, it works and the scent does not lingure. It also leaves my face so soft after each use. To test, a few times I did not moisturize after and it did not leave my face tight or dry as other products have. The price and size for such an organic product is outstanding. A little goes a long way, will last me awhile. As with any soap, it stings if it gets in the eyes or if you have an open cut.</li>
    <li> This soap makes my working hands smile and I can feel the oils being absorbed into the skin and see the nice clean glow.I have tried most of Mr. Woods flavors and this one is tops!</li>
    <li> Ok - so I was told about this soap by a friend who said it was much cheaper than Bronner&#x27;s and was virtually identical. Not so! At first I noticed it was a lot thicker and I thought this would be a good thing, but it makes it hard to mix for foam pump bottles. It doesn&#x27;t leave that strong tingle feeling like Bronners does and really, it&#x27;s not that much cheaper. I have also used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint for many years as a spray in my garden to keep bugs at bay but didn&#x27;t notice much bug reduction when using the Dr. Woods soap. I will stick with paying a few bucks more for my beloved Bronners because I know it works! http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00120VWJ0/?tag&#x3D;theprescat-20</li>
    <li> Item received in timely manner and matched description. I dilute with water for hand washing.</li>
    <li> I saw the Shea Butter at the main ingredient, and i ordered it.  its smell is great but it burns at sensitive area.</li>
    <li> Great for skin rash! My husband had a heat rash that kept coming back even after the doctor had treated it. Within one day the redness was a lot better and bleeding had stopped. In one week it had healed and only a little discoloration was left in the area. He now use it everyday for showering and I use it every other day do to it can be very drying to my skin. We will keep buying this item.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap and it is reasonably priced compared to other natural soaps. The scent is mild and pleasant. When comparing to Dr. Bronners it is less drying but also less sudsy. I would recommend this if you have dry skin. I use it as shampoo too, as it does not strip my hair of all natural oils. I also like it as a facial cleanser since it is not drying. I have been using it for my dog as well and it leaves her with a very soft coat.</li>
    <li> Used to like this formula, but this week, the product burnt my skin.  I accidentally let some of it mix with the conditioner in my hair, and instantly i got awful burns on my face, ears, and neck.  Very painful, and very puffy.  Even my eyeballs are burnt.  So, either use this product alone, or don&#x27;t use it at all.  Product seems to be gentle on the skin, under most circumstances.</li>
    <li> I love black soap and usually use nubian heritage but its more expensive for less amount compared to Dr.Woods soap, so I cheated on my nubian heritage for Dr. Woods and decided to try it. Mistake. The smell is too strong, too overpowering. I like to put on my fragrances of my choice after washing dependent on my mood that day and its just not possible when you smell like a 40 yr old man. I love the texture, I love black soap but this Dr. Woods stuff is just too much. Its a very heavy musky scent. I have an entire bottle that I have used once that is going into the trash. Parfum is listed as an ingredient...and it should have been left out of the mix if you ask me it totally destroys the soap. Also, black soap \\&quot;concentrate\\&quot; is the 4th listed ingredient which makes me feel like its not the main focus of the soap.</li>
    <li> I will never use this product on my hair again. The smell is terrible! It&#x27;s like woodsmoke and old lady mixed and it doesn&#x27;t fade. I smell it every time I turn my head! I hoping to use the rest of the bottle as body and maybe face wash, since the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to stick to my skin as much as it did in my hair. My skin felt fine after my shower, but a bit dry. I was very excited to try this stuff, and I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I&#x27;m giving it one star because the smell is so horrible and I won&#x27;t be able to wash it out until I get off of work this evening. It&#x27;s miserable.</li>
    <li> Unlike Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, which I have used off and on for 40 years and do not like because it dries my skin extremely, Dr. Brown&#x27;s with shea butter (I don&#x27;t know about other DB products but have used the shea butter soap in peppermint and now black soap) does not dry out your skin. In fact I use it for shaving and take a small bottle with me when traveling to use as shampooo, shave soap and regular soap all in one. The shea butter somehow leaves your skin relatively moisturized compared to even high end shave creams and my skin is extremely sensitive now to anything chemical or drying. I recommend this soap highly. I note some reviewers commented on the smell - in my experience, the black soap smells neutral and clean, not strong, and my wife likes it also, so I have no negative comment at all on that. I like it.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery.  This soap is concentrated, foams well and a little truly does go a long way and you&#x27;ll find that using less gives better results for this product.  For those interested in or concerned about scent, it has a clean scent (reminds me of the original Pears glycerine soap, before the formula was changed) that for me, does linger on my skin (which I like).  I use the product for daily face wash and as body wash and occasional shampoo in the shower and it works very well.  Overall, it&#x27;s non-drying and does clean well, while staying gentle on sensitive skin (acne, psoriasis) IF you keep in mind the amount you are using.  Over-dispensing will require excessive rinsing/removal and that&#x27;s where you&#x27;ll find it can cause irritation.  Not because the product isn&#x27;t gentle, but because you are using too much for the intended purpose.  So, if a tiny dot of the product gets the job done, just use that amount. (for that reason my household can&#x27;t recommend this for face shaving as you can&#x27;t quite build the foam needed for a good face shave).  In any case, the price is very reasonable for the amount, so I think it&#x27;s worth giving it a try even if you&#x27;re unsure.  The first time I purchased, I went in with the expectation that if I didn&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;d just fill my liquid soap dispensers and or I&#x27;d just give it away and call it a day.  Now, as a regular user of the product, I&#x27;m very pleased with it&#x27;s performance for what I need it for and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This has the feel of silk and the fragrance is wonderful; a little goes a long way. Try it!</li>
    <li> This is a great soap to put in a pump foam dispenser for your hands. The foam is great to ooze into a facial cleansing brush or just foam on your hands and use on your face. My daughter and grandson have psoriasis and this soap has ended soap induced breakouts for them. You truly feel clean without itching and it leaves your skin and hair very soft. I really can&#x27;t adequately express how this has changed my daughter&#x27;s life! Until you have something like psoriasis that grows on your hands and up your arms like she did and then all it takes is a healthy product to rid yourself, you might not understand. But for those with similar issues you will get the relief I am talking about. We also use it on all the dogs. They have no itching after bathing them.</li>
    <li> I use this primarily for washing my face in the morning and working up a nice lather for shaving. As a bonus, it seems to have cleared up some minor skin issues. It&#x27;s pretty expensive, though.</li>
    <li> This has been the great skin cleanser I have ever used.  Had terribly dry skin.  No more and have recommended to friends.  And it is the &amp;#34;cleanest&amp;#34; smelling soap I have every used!</li>
    <li> Best soup I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have already noticed a change in skin tone and a more even texture in one week-  something a round of Obaji Nu Derm failed to show me. I follow Dr Woods with Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel. Fabulous for my skin!</li>
    <li> We love this soap! Works great for oily skin without over drying. Skip all the bs acne crap. Black soap, drink water, n eat good diet...will see huge difference!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert to using this to wash my face. I initially bought it to try instead of castille soap in my home made house cleaners.  I thought &amp;#34;this can&#x27;t be used tow ash your face! Its soap! It&#x27;ll dry my skin!&amp;#34;  I tried it anyway and the &amp;#34;peely nose&amp;#34; skin I get once in a while vanished. My skin was softer, felt very clean, and in the six weeks that I&amp;#34;ve used it, I&#x27;ve hardly had any blemishes appear. I&#x27;m sold!!!  I wash my face twice at night to make sure all makeup is gone and then just one wash in the morning. I find it amazing that I can use this product in so many ways.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this soap and get warm fuzzys thinking about the ingedrients.  The odor is unique, not really bad, but not something I would chose given an option.  It is not stronge and doesn&#x27;t linger so overall a good product.</li>
    <li> I started using this product when I decided to use more healthy, earth-friendly products a few years ago, and I had no idea that this black soap would be so incredibly versatile. I bath in it, wash my hair with it, and make my facial scrub with it by mixing it with cinnamon. It cleanses extremely well, but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or curly hair out. I loved the regular Dr Woods Black Soap, but I love this kind with shea butter even more, as that it one of my favorite things to use on my skin and hair. I think the shea butter makes it even more moisturizing! It lathers nicely, and has a clean, pleasant, gentle fragrance that I love. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> It has a very unique, light ,musky scent and makes your skin soft. It lathers up very nicely. It has also been effective in clearing up blemishes on my face. In addition to using this as body wash, I&#x27;ve also used it as a shampoo (which leaves your hair with a pleasant scent) and as an all-purpose bathroom cleaner (whch was surprisingly effective). I will definently be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> I love the clean smell and it is very good for sensitive skin.  I feel it helps keep my skin from breaking out.  I&#x27;ve bought over 12 bottles of this in the past and continue to order over and over.</li>
    <li> Having used this soap routinely on my face for several weeks, I can honestly say it has given me the clearest complexion I&#x27;ve had in memory, without excessive dryness.  I&#x27;ve battled acne forever and now it&#x27;s all but cured.  My skin looks and feels great.  I no longer use pimple cream or need lots of makeup to cover blemishes when I go out; just a little moisturizer and I&#x27;m good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started washing with this my face tingled and even felt a tiny bit &amp;#34;burn-y&amp;#34; but given other people&#x27;s reviews I kept with it and realized that was just sloughing and healing happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Just what my skin needed leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized. Nice and sulky</li>
    <li> It makes my hand skin so dry that no amount of moisturizer can fix it. The other thing it smells of chemical.</li>
    <li> I like the clean feeling. I can see black heads removed and the smell is great. I did break out a lot. It was similar to a rash. After three weeks of continued use twice a day I decided to take a break and use the clinique soap I had been using and retin a to clear the bumps. I resumed it two weeks later and the bumps returned. I liked the size of the bottle for the price. I only wish my skin wasn&#x27;t so sensitive. I will give to a friend to try.</li>
    <li> Big time favorite for my entire body, hair, and face!</li>
    <li> daughter is super allergic to many things. this soap (and bronner) are the only two that don&#x27;t make her skin all itchy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years now and I believe it to be a great product.  I think this product has helped regain smooth even tone skin again.</li>
    <li> This product is a keeper!!! I bought for my baby because he had very dry skin and cradle cap. After using the Cradle Cap Lotion from babies r us several times he still had dry scalp at 5 months. My sister suggested I use this on his hair about once per week with this. Combined with using natural oils on his scalp the flakes are finally gone. I also used this to give him baths and his skin responded great. I then tried on myself and my 4 year old daughter...needless to say this will be a product i will keep in my home. I begin using it as my facial cleaser and my skin felt so clean without drying out. I also use it as a shampoo sometimes. Overall it doesn&#x27;t have a great smell but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger so i can deal with the scent because the outcomes are phenomenal!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for almost a year, as a female, if you have sensitive skin I would not in your \\&quot;personal\\&quot; areas, it may cause a slight burn. I use Summers Eve and unscented Dove on my daugher&#x27;s area. Otherwise, the product is still working great!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I wash my face with it daily and have noticed dark spots lightening. It&#x27;s a little drying though, so moisturize after using.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! The smell at first was a little different but now I don&#x27;t even notice it. This soap is great for my skin, and my skin feels really soft after using it. Anytime I run out of it I instantly break out, so I try to always have a bottle at home. I&#x27;ve tried other black soap brands and didn&#x27;t like them at all. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I absolutely luv black soap. Dr. Woods black soap is very rich in lather. It only takes a small drop of soap for usage. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean. Refreshing!!!</li>
    <li> My kids love it.. they use it on acne prone skin. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and soft skin.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday for shampoo and body wash.  It is a great, natural clean.  I tried many so-called natural products that would say they were paraben and SLS free but then put in something very similar.  This has also improved my complexion - black soap is known for this.  Hair is a little difficult to comb right out of the shower as I do not use any conditioner or rinse.  But I follow up with a little Dr. Bronners organic leave-in conditioner and my hair has never done better.</li>
    <li> I first bought black soap by accident, looking for Dr. Woods Shea Vision Castille soap, which I had been using for a couple of years. I&#x27;m so glad for the mistake. I normally spend the winter itching, no matter how many humidifiers I run or what kind of lotion I use. The only cure I ever found for my dermatitis was a few minutes in a tanning bed, something my doctor frowns on and I don&#x27;t really have time for. Dr. Woods Shea Vision Pure Black Soap put an end to that and I made it through last winter without a tanning bed! No more scratching until I bleed. Winter dermatitis seems to be a thing of the past with this product. Love the fresh, not flowery, lavendar fragrance and my husband does as well. This is my only body wash from now on.</li>
    <li> This product smells and feels great. You feel really clean after.&lt;br /&gt;not really sure it&#x27;s helping with scars though</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this soap before and I loved it enough to get a bigger size this time! It is the one thing (other than coconut oil) that has helped my skin. I&#x27;ve had acne for about 10 years now, not too bad, but constant breakouts and black heads (and I have large pores). Awhile back, I started using coconut oil as a facial moisturizer, but I still needed something to give me that clean feeling on my face. This is squeaky clean, so as you splash water on your face to clear up the soap, it gets hard to rub (which you shouldn&#x27;t do anyways). I suggest if you wear makeup, to use makeup wipes before using this, because it doesn&#x27;t quite clear off the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have a slight allergy to water (yes, water) so showering is a hassle. This and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap are the only two things that I&#x27;ve tried that have helped calm my skin down in my showers. I&#x27;m love having all natural ingredients when it comes to my body, and this is a must!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve been using it for a month or so now, and my skin loves it. You will have to use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
    <li> Great cleansing soap.  My wife and both use it.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about a month. I&#x27;ve never even heard of black soap before I bought this.  I&#x27;ve always had pretty clear skin but I&#x27;ve noticed as I&#x27;ve gotten older (I am a 33 year old white female), I tend to break out a lot and am also my skin has gotten rougher in spots.  I am very particular about what I use on my face and there are only a few products that I can use that will control the acne and won&#x27;t irritate it further.  So when I bought this I was originally looking for a face wash, and I was in Earth Fare so I was hoping to find something natural without any chemicals. I saw this and noticed it said that it helps with skin blemishes, and after reading the bottle I decided to try it. I found I was able to use it without it irritating my skin and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight or dry, maybe only VERY slightly but not enough for it to be a problem or stop using it. After a month of use my skin seems to be clearer than it was when I first started using it.  I seem to always have some blemishes on my face anyway but I found when I do break out it is not as bad.  I have also noticed where my skin was rough it seems to have smoothed out a bit. I have also been using it as a body wash. I really like that I am using a natural product and not putting a bunch of chemicals on my skin. As far as the smell, when I first smelled it from the bottle I just thought it smelled like plain soap, but I have found after using it, it leaves a very light, earthy, slightly musky scent on your skin and someone else that smelled it on me after getting out of the shower had complimented me on the scent. So I think it smells different after actually using it. I am usually not a fan of musky smells but I like the scent, and after using this I smelled the body wash I had been using, and it was amazing how strong and full of chemicals my old body wash smelled. So glad I am not using those nasty chemicals on my skin anymore. Overall I really like this soap and I will continue to use it on my face &amp; body, the only problem I have with it is on the ingredient list it says &#x27;black soap concentrate&#x27;, and I don&#x27;t know if that is good or bad but maybe next time I will look for a different brand. But I really like this soap and I would definitely buy it again &amp; recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  The whole family uses it for face, hair and body.  I also use it at the bathroom sink in a foam bottle, which is perfect as it&#x27;s slightly runnier than your average chemical ridden soap.  As well, I have it in a spray bottle with water for quick mess clean ups and have used it for floors, my washing machine and even dishes in a pinch.  It removed bright red beet from my daughter&#x27;s white shirt perfectly and has a mild yet pleasant smell.  My favourite and only soap!</li>
    <li> Just started using,i love it on my body and smells fresh all day.My face ..i&#x27;m not too sure as im used to using very high quality products and achieved results that i&#x27;m happy with but i saw all the rave reviews and had to try,so i guess it&#x27;s unfair to say i don&#x27;t like it yet.Time will tell.</li>
    <li> Cleans skin &amp; hair very well....it removes all oil and dirt...I also clean my makeup brushes with this</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed. It is far inferior to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, which I can dilute. This stuff lasted only 1/3 of the time because you can&#x27;t dilute it if you want a decent lather. I also didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for years as my only face wash and as body wash. It exfoliates my face nicely.  I no longer have any issues with acne.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. This is the only product I will wash my face with. Cleanses my pores and leaves my face smooth.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes it!:)</li>
    <li> Great product, I have seen a great improvement in the condition of my skin!</li>
    <li> I was hopeful this product would live up to the reviews. Perhaps it does, but to me the fragrance was so overwhelming and lingering that I could not continue to use it. The smell remained on my washcloth for days after only one use. If a strong fragrance is a problem for you, I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my staple now. This product help my acne and leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized. I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about 3 weeks and my skin has improved a great deal. All my old acne marks are fading. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I&#x27;ve already bought another bottle to have when I run out of the first one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the ingredients in this soap, but it hasn&#x27;t done anything for me. I have acne prone, incredibly dry skin with severe seborrheic dermatitis. Unfortunately, this soap did nothing. I used it on my face and hair for a few months and noticed absolutely no change. It also smells awful. I know I have incredibly difficult skin, so I&#x27;m giving this three stars because I do believe it to be a high quality natural soap, but it wasn&#x27;t the cure I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I think this product is great!  The smell is not necessarily the best part, but I don&#x27;t think it stinks either.  I think we are just so accustomed to those strong fruity smells of most other soaps these days.  I have used it from head to toe.  It doesn&#x27;t lather in my hair as much as commercial shampoos does, but all natural castile soaps are not supposed too! :-) My favorite Dr. Woods Soap is the baby soap though!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap to use on my body in the shower and I&#x27;m loving it! The smell is not too strong, and it leaves me feeling clean without being overly drying. Great natural product. I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This really seems to have cleared up the scaliness i had on some small areas and i like the smell too!</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It is wonderful on my skin. I love the scent too. You can use it as a house cleaner as well. It gets out stains that others products don&#x27;t get out.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more natural soap to use without all that \\&quot;other stuff\\&quot; in it. I also wanted a soap that would make a difference in my skin. Dr. Woods achieves both of these desires. It is also very reasonably priced, unlike some natural products. Dr. Woods is not thick at all but quite liquidity. Since it suds up so well a little goes a long way. The smell is light and earthy with an herbal hint of vanilla smell. I don&#x27;t find it off putting at all but rather pleasant. Dr. Woods is not a fruity (which i like) or an artificial smell. My skin looks so much clearer, brighter and alive than without it. And if i skip lotion (particularly in the summer) my skin doesn&#x27;t look terrible without it because this soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like that. Thank you, Dr. Woods!</li>
    <li> I have nothing negative to say about Dr. Woods Shea Vision Black Soap. I used it for personal bathing versus it being used as a cleaning product. I didn&#x27;t feel I liked it as a shampoo though it didn&#x27;t do any damage to my hair either way. Overall...seemed quality as a bathing detergent.</li>
    <li> I love the way it cleans &amp; leaves my skin feeling clean, soft and smooth.  Yes, I will be getting more!</li>
    <li> I only use organic (no SLS) for soaps, shampoos, etc., and this bottle of liquid black soap is exceptional.  there is a fresh, clean smell to the product, nothing overpowering, that makes it an excellent shower soap.  I&#x27;ve also read that others have used it to clean hand washables!</li>
    <li> Very beneficial product! Relieves skin irritations immediately and restores healthy texture and glow. Works great as a lathering shampoo too; it does not dry out my natural, loc&#x27;d tresses.</li>
    <li> Great product and great shipping. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for 2-3 years. I use it as a shampoo and body wash. I love the way it smells and get a lot of compliments. I have naturally oily skin and hair, so the shea in this soap is an adequate amount of moisture for me. During the winter when the weather is drier I sometimes need to use a conditioned on the ends of my hair.</li>
