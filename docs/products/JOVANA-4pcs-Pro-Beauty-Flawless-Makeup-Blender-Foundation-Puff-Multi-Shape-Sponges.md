      <li>The shape is wonderful as well, it helps alot.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still good!</li>
      <li>but they are a great alternative if you don&#x27;t want to spend $20 on one sponge.</li>
      <li>These sponges are great for putting on my liquid foundation and blush.</li>
      <li>Great product... works well</li>
      <li>Nice to apply make up!</li>
      <li>Took awhile to receive but was in good shape once it arrived.</li>
      <li>Love these!</li>
      <li>but it is nice for cream products.</li>
      <li>One was in it&#x27;s own package.</li>
      <li>Kind of wish it&#x27;d would&#x27;ve been a bit better in the consistency.</li>
      <li>These were really good for the cost not bad for the price</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the quality of it, then again it was very cheap.</li>
      <li>Very cheap.</li>
      <li>I really love them supper cute .</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>but i have to leave them on a glass of water for like a week if i want better results.</li>
      <li>but they are so darn cute</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to cancel the order</li>
      <li>A lot of people love these things....</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want these even if they were free</li>
      <li>Very porous and effective.</li>
      <li>If you think this will be a cheap alternative to a beauty blender, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>use a body wash to clean it every couple of days, and it cleans and rinses out well.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
      <li>soooo well I love them so much.</li>
      <li>ordered them a second time I loved them so much!!</li>
      <li>I ordered these thinking they would arrive quickly</li>
      <li>Spend a few more bucks and get a better one!</li>
      <li>There amazing just not as big as I thought</li>
      <li>and they are definitely worth the wait.</li>
      <li>I really liked this product, it is similar to the beauty blender without paying as much money.</li>
      <li>i thought i was going to get exactly what the picture portrayed.</li>
      <li>do work much better than the standard triangle sponges from the drugstore.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;It made my face stink the whole day</li>
      <li>just make sure you wet it before hand.</li>
      <li>They are much softer and easier to manipulate and.......their like a dollar a bag</li>
      <li>Since they are so cheap, it wasnt that big of a deal, except that it took almost a month to get here.</li>
      <li>They arrived very soon too.</li>
      <li>I have not tried sponges besides these and the ones just mentioned, but based on the videos I have seen of the popular, expensive &#x27;brand-name&#x27; sponge they seem to do the exact same thing, for a much more realistic price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very small, very hard to clean, but blends makeup wonderfully</li>
      <li>Also they could be a little better at blending.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are much heavier and denser and once wet they actually feel more like chunk of rubber than a sponge.</li>
      <li>The sponges completely soak up the makeup and won&#x27;t transfer onto your skin.</li>
      <li>It helps me to get the coverage I need while maintaining a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The sponges are so soft.</li>
      <li>If it didn&#x27;t work for you that probably means you didn&#x27;t dampen the sponges they are meant to be dampened not dry</li>

<li> They did take a little bit to get here, but I don&#x27;t really care about that as long as I get them</li>
<li> I got one yellow and 3 pink and all of them were the same shape.</li>
<li> Not a nice as a real beauty blender</li>
<li> I thought they would get bigger when you wet them like the Beauty Blender</li>
<li> Took long to arrive and they do their job</li>
<li> /&gt;They are not soft and spongy so you cant use them to blend and bounce it like a beauty blender&lt;</li>
<li> They were a little hard at first but it softened over time (I don&#x27;t ever put it under water)</li>
<li> When i put it under the water, the pink color went from pink and turned ORANGE!&lt;br</li>
<li> I should have just went to the store and paid a few extra bucks.</li>
<li> these really do not come close to the brand name.</li>
<li> Not as big as i thought it would be, one of the beauty blender was quite hard.</li>
<li> /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone buy these to use as a makeup blender because you are putting cheap product and probably bad chemicals on your face.</li>
<li> I was expecting at least a couple different shapes</li>
<li> Packaged from China or Japan with foreign writing on the package, so you&#x27;re not really sure what you&#x27;re getting.  </li>
<li> Had to wash it a few times and it still smelled chemical-y.</li>
<li> /&gt;Update: after getting the brand name sponges, I see what I was missing...</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t, they are far to stiff and difficult to work with.  </li>
<li> They are too small and absorb all my makeup.</li>
<li> It does NOT expand and is very stiff</li>
<li> Extremely hard and non plyable.</li>
<li> They are hard and absorb all my makeup.</li>
<li> but this one colors leaked so bad it turned from pink to orange!</li>
<li> The sponges had a weird smell to them, but were o.k.</li>
<li> the seller sent me the wrong shapes and refused to refund</li>
<li> I could not give them a bad review.</li>
<li> You get what you pay for:(</li>
<li> also they had an awful smell that didn&#x27;t go away even after washing them...</li>
<li> nasty</li>

    <li> Took long to arrive and they do their job but i have to leave them on a glass of water for like a week if i want better results.</li>
    <li> Great product... works well</li>
    <li> If you think this will be a cheap alternative to a beauty blender, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;The sponges feel nothing like a beauty blender from sephora&lt;br /&gt;They are much heavier and denser and once wet they actually feel more like chunk of rubber than a sponge. (Think of using a giant pencil eraser to apply makeup)&lt;br /&gt;They are not soft and spongy so you cant use them to blend and bounce it like a beauty blender&lt;br /&gt;It does nothing for makeup application&lt;br /&gt;It also smells AWFUL&lt;br /&gt;It made my face stink the whole day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the seller sent me the wrong shapes and refused to refund&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this junk</li>
    <li> These sponges are great for putting on my liquid foundation and blush. It helps me to get the coverage I need while maintaining a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I use a body wash to clean it every couple of days, and it cleans and rinses out well.&lt;br /&gt;These do work much better than the standard triangle sponges from the drugstore. I have not tried sponges besides these and the ones just mentioned, but based on the videos I have seen of the popular, expensive &#x27;brand-name&#x27; sponge they seem to do the exact same thing, for a much more realistic price.&lt;br /&gt;Update: after getting the brand name sponges, I see what I was missing...gotta deduct some stars...these really do not come close to the brand name.</li>
    <li> They are tiny! I was hoping to get something bigger than those</li>
    <li> I really liked this product, it is similar to the beauty blender without paying as much money.</li>
    <li> Very porous and effective. Blended my makeup well and forms well to the face. Only thing is it reeked of chemicals. Had to wash it a few times and it still smelled chemical-y.</li>
    <li> i recieved them 18 days after the delivery period and Didnt even receive what I  paid for also they had an awful smell that didn&#x27;t go away even after washing them...I wouldn&#x27;t want these even if they were free</li>
    <li> to tell you the truth I decided to just use these for display but they are so darn cute I could not give them a bad review. just wish I would of received different colors i have 2 yellows.</li>
    <li> I was expecting at least a couple different shapes but I got four of the same two yellow two blue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to smaller sponges so these were much bigger in my opinion. They were a little hard at first but it softened over time (I don&#x27;t ever put it under water) and I rather like the firmness. The shape is wonderful as well, it helps alot.</li>
    <li> I really love them supper cute .</li>
    <li> Not a nice as a real beauty blender but it is nice for cream products. Took awhile to receive but was in good shape once it arrived.</li>
    <li> The pic shows two tear drop styles and two regular beauty blender when in fact all were the same (Beauty blender) i thought i was going to get exactly what the picture portrayed. I don&#x27;t like the quality of it, then again it was very cheap.</li>
    <li> A lot of people love these things....I don&#x27;t, they are far to stiff and difficult to work with.  I went back to the white disposable sponge tabs for blending and applying foundation.  They are much softer and easier to manipulate and.......their like a dollar a bag</li>
    <li> These were really good for the cost not bad for the price</li>
    <li> Love these! They arrived very soon too.</li>
    <li> If it didn&#x27;t work for you that probably means you didn&#x27;t dampen the sponges they are meant to be dampened not dry and they work soooo well I love them so much. They did take a little bit to get here, but I don&#x27;t really care about that as long as I get them and they are definitely worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I was order different shapes but I got four of the same shape .</li>
    <li> Makes for a great finish!</li>
    <li> Extremely hard and non plyable. The sponges completely soak up the makeup and won&#x27;t transfer onto your skin. Smells toxic.</li>
    <li> All the same product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy! The only reason I would even give it 1 star is for the price. Nothing like an actual beauty blender.. No variety either. I got all 4 the same shape and the shape I wanted I didn&#x27;t even get. They are hard and absorb all my makeup. It also took over a month to get to me. Spend a few more bucks and get a better one!</li>
    <li> helps put my makeup on evenly</li>
    <li> Very small, very hard to clean, but blends makeup wonderfully</li>
    <li> I ordered these thinking they would arrive quickly but as soon as I placed the order I saw they would be almost a month from arriving. I wasn&#x27;t able to cancel the order so I just waited. Once the box was opened, I saw that the sponges arrived in multiple packages. One was in it&#x27;s own package. I didn&#x27;t notice a smell but while washing them after use, I noticed the color was coming off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone buy these to use as a makeup blender because you are putting cheap product and probably bad chemicals on your face.</li>
    <li> smaller in size that what i was thinking they would be. but gets the job done. just make sure you wet it before hand.</li>
    <li> Nice to apply make up!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for:(</li>
    <li> Packaged from China or Japan with foreign writing on the package, so you&#x27;re not really sure what you&#x27;re getting.  The sponges had a weird smell to them, but were o.k. after washing them.</li>
    <li> I thought they would get bigger when you wet them like the Beauty Blender but they are a great alternative if you don&#x27;t want to spend $20 on one sponge. Also they could be a little better at blending.</li>
    <li> Kind of wish it&#x27;d would&#x27;ve been a bit better in the consistency. It was what you pay for.</li>
    <li> ordered them a second time I loved them so much!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I bought style 4. The sponges are so soft. I like a lot.</li>
    <li> Very cheap. I got one yellow and 3 pink and all of them were the same shape. Definitely not a variety like the picture shows. They are too small and absorb all my makeup. Since they are so cheap, it wasnt that big of a deal, except that it took almost a month to get here. Imagine waiting all that time to find out these things are garbage. I should have just went to the store and paid a few extra bucks.</li>
    <li> Not as big as i thought it would be, one of the beauty blender was quite hard. For this price though, I can&#x27;t complain. I use it all the time and it&#x27;s still good!</li>
    <li> There amazing just not as big as I thought</li>
    <li> This is disgusting!&lt;br /&gt;1. It does NOT expand and is very stiff&lt;br /&gt;2. When i put it under the water, the pink color went from pink and turned ORANGE!&lt;br /&gt;3. The color was also leaking!!! I know the beauty blender also has a color leak when you wash it but this one colors leaked so bad it turned from pink to orange! It is gross! I didnt even put soap in it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely want a refund and</li>
    <li> nasty and it put flakes on my skin from the color or the blender</li>
