      <li>Great hair product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a good curly shampoo/conditioner since they took the John Freida stuff for curly hair off the market.</li>
      <li>It never fails to produce results that keep my hair looking and feeling its best!</li>
      <li>That product is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve found for when I want my hair to be straight.  </li>
      <li>This is the best product that I have found to give my curls soft body and definition.  </li>
      <li>I was apprehensive about this product but after my first try I was in love!!</li>
      <li>love cat walk, will buy more</li>
      <li>Have used it for years and love what it does for my curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
      <li>Packaging aside, I am concerned more with the product itself.  </li>
      <li>Will get more</li>
      <li>it really makes my hair curly, and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy, and it smells really good.</li>
      <li>I was totally ready for a just okay better than nothing result...</li>
      <li>I have loved Tigi Catwalk Conditioner for years, and was excited when I found it here when it was no longer available locally.  </li>
      <li>quickly</li>
      <li>Luckily it didn&#x27;t spill everywhere inside.</li>
      <li>not so pretty when I don&#x27;t use it!</li>
      <li>My curls are more curly, shiny and feels so soft!</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner for naturally curly hair.</li>

      <li>This is my favorite conditioner I&#x27;ve used, especially for the price!!</li>
      <li>have never seen that, makes me wonder if counterfeit product as what reputable hair product company would make such an error.</li>
      <li>I bought this after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>My hair is curly and super-picky and Curls Rock seems to have the proper balance of nourishing and not too oily - my hair curls very prettily when I use this conditioner,</li>
      <li>I have some natural curl &amp; wave, but this conditioner has taken my hair to a whole new level.  </li>
      <li>Definitely not the right product for my slightly-more-than-wavy-but-not-curly-enough hair.</li>
      <li>I tried this product because I was looking for something new to use on my curly hair..</li>
      <li>Most conditioners way down my natural curls and in return require me to add product to bring back the bounce in my hair.</li>
      <li>I just reviewed a straight hair product made by the same company.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if there is any way of knowing if the product has had anything added to it post-production, or perhaps it is just old?</li>
      <li>When I received the package, the bottle&#x27;s cap was completely off.  </li>
      <li>but so far I used like a quarter of the bottle in like three weeks, twice a day.</li>
      <li>Better than the more expensive Purology and Aveda and other curly hair conditioners.</li>
      <li>Kind of expensive but works...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it daily for over a month now, switched back to some old Pantene conditioner for curly hair</li>

<li> No over powering and dragging down the curl.</li>

<li> Didn&#x27;t realize how small the container is or that the product itself contains glycerin.</li>
<li> Unfortunately it leaves my hair is LESS curly and limp.</li>
<li> Ridiculous that a conditioner would have no directions.  </li>
<li> Both parts were wrapped up inside a thin plastic bag.  </li>
<li> I am so sad they discontinued this brand because the replacement Curlesque is not nearly as good.</li>

    <li> My fine, natural curly hair does well with this.</li>
    <li> I just reviewed a straight hair product made by the same company.  That product is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve found for when I want my hair to be straight.  This stuff--Curls Rock--is the very best for my hair when I wear it curly.  Better than the more expensive Purology and Aveda and other curly hair conditioners.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years and love what it does for my curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Came quickly</li>
    <li> I have some natural curl &amp; wave, but this conditioner has taken my hair to a whole new level.  Even some of the men at work have given me compliments about my hair!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how small the container is or that the product itself contains glycerin. Not actually beneficial for curls, whatever the hair company will tell you.</li>
    <li> Ridiculous that a conditioner would have no directions.  Absolutely no information on amount to use or time to leave in.&lt;br /&gt;I have never seen that, makes me wonder if counterfeit product as what reputable hair product company would make such an error.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I was looking for something new to use on my curly hair..It&#x27;s awesome..I love the smell and it leaves my hair so soft and it was manageable..Great product</li>
    <li> Great product for curly hair! I am so sad they discontinued this brand because the replacement Curlesque is not nearly as good.</li>
    <li> I was totally ready for a just okay better than nothing result... the reality is, this thing works... I&#x27;m washing my hair every two days, and I use this conditioner after leaving the shower or wetting my hair... it really makes my hair curly, and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy, and it smells really good. Kind of expensive but works... Will get more but so far I used like a quarter of the bottle in like three weeks, twice a day.</li>
    <li> These products made my hair super-frizzy, and I don&#x27;t care for the smell. Definitely not the right product for my slightly-more-than-wavy-but-not-curly-enough hair.</li>
    <li> Most conditioners way down my natural curls and in return require me to add product to bring back the bounce in my hair. The shampoo is a bit drying, but the combination of the 2, conditioner and shampoo, work well on my hair with no additional products.</li>
    <li> Great hair product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have loved Tigi Catwalk Conditioner for years, and was excited when I found it here when it was no longer available locally.  When I received the package, the bottle&#x27;s cap was completely off.  Both parts were wrapped up inside a thin plastic bag.  Luckily it didn&#x27;t spill everywhere inside. Packaging aside, I am concerned more with the product itself.  It has an odd smell to it, not quite what I had grown accustomed to with this product in the past.  The performance seems a bit off also.  I don&#x27;t know if there is any way of knowing if the product has had anything added to it post-production, or perhaps it is just old?</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue so my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down, and curls are bouncy.</li>
    <li> love cat walk, will buy more</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a good curly shampoo/conditioner since they took the John Freida stuff for curly hair off the market. I wanted to find a substitute that won&#x27;t break the bank (my product of choice is bumble and bumble&#x27;s but $25/bottle, YIKES!!!) I bought this after reading all the positive reviews. Unfortunately it leaves my hair is LESS curly and limp. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for over a month now, switched back to some old Pantene conditioner for curly hair I had lying around, and voila, back to curly!</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive about this product but after my first try I was in love!! My curls are more curly, shiny and feels so soft! This is my favorite conditioner I&#x27;ve used, especially for the price!!</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair this is a must have for you. The moisture is just right. No over powering and dragging down the curl. For best results use with Tigi Curls Rock shampoo. This is always my go to for great looking hair. It never fails to produce results that keep my hair looking and feeling its best!</li>
    <li> This is the best product that I have found to give my curls soft body and definition.  Try it you too should like it.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner for naturally curly hair. It helps keep the frizz under control.</li>
    <li> I use this daily because I have thick curly hair and it helps with the tangles.  I only have to run my fingers thru my hair when I&#x27;m done.  Can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
