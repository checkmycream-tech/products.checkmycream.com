<li> it&#x27;s hard to see the true color.</li>
<li> It was long lasting as well.  </li>
<li> &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t give a Rotterdam&amp;#34; requires 3 solid coats to be opaque and is not a bright blue at all, but it is pretty.  </li>
<li> so it&#x27;s not really OPI&#x27;s fault -</li>
<li> Not very practical.</li>
<li> Shipping took longer than expected, but it was Christmas time</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a pale blue with shimmery stuff in it....</li>
<li> Arrived on time and as expected!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know any other company that has a color like it.  </li>
<li> I purchased this color along with 2 other colors for Christmas gifts and ended up keeping this one for myself.</li>
<li> I use a base coat, 3 coats, and Seche Vite top coat while polish is wet.</li>
<li> I know that it&#x27;s hard to match something like this because each computer is different -</li>
<li> seeing that it does have a little bit of shimmer in it, but not enough to be that hard to remove glitter.  </li>
<li> This color is so subtle and quiet.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately it takes about six coats to get where you can&#x27;t see through to the pink of the underneath of the fingernail.</li>
<li> This is not a bright statement color.  </li>

    <li> Cute color. A bit too grey-looking for my taste, but cute.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish!</li>
    <li> beautiful color for summer.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this color. It looked nothing like the photo when I received it. I know that it&#x27;s hard to match something like this because each computer is different - so it&#x27;s not really OPI&#x27;s fault - (because I even looked at it on their website). I gave it to my daughter - she liked it.</li>
    <li> I Don&#x27;t Give a Rotterdam - Gray blue with shimmery gold specks, so it is a pretty color. Unfortunately it takes about six coats to get where you can&#x27;t see through to the pink of the underneath of the fingernail. Two coats is NOT going to cut it.  Not very practical.</li>
    <li> Color is not as opaque as I&#x27;d hoped, takes multiple coats to get some density of color. Arrived on time and as expected!</li>
    <li> This has been a great color for the early spring.  It is a soft blue/gray color with a shimmer.  I have received many compliments when wearing it.</li>
    <li> This is not a bright statement color.  &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t give a Rotterdam&amp;#34; requires 3 solid coats to be opaque and is not a bright blue at all, but it is pretty.

    <li> It is a pretty color, I was just looking for wedgewood and this is more of a grey than a blue.  Still a very nice polish.</li>
    <li> opi does it again they never cease to amaze me with what they can do with nailpolishes. OPI product user for life!</li>
    <li> I like the color of this polish.  It will go with pretty much anything.  Not too blue, not too gray.  Also, it was a pleasant surprise receiving it seeing that it does have a little bit of shimmer in it, but not enough to be that hard to remove glitter.  Very nice shade to be trendy, yet still a little conservative and safe.</li>
    <li> This is the best polish out there. The color is gorgeous, goes on smooth without streaking and dries super fast. O.P.I. is my new favorite go to polish! I would totally recommend this polish to family and friends!</li>
    <li> I was hoping the color would be thinker and more of a matte. Its like a shimmer and semi-sheer, but still in a nice color.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color.  I don&#x27;t know any other company that has a color like it.  I stare at it all the time when I wear it.  It&#x27;s like a blue/gray mix.  Love, love.</li>
    <li> Meh. That&#x27;s about all I give this color. First coat is rather clear so without a second coat it&#x27;s hard to see the true color. It&#x27;s also a bit more on the gray side and the shimmer effect is more than I expected.</li>
    <li> The I don&#x27;t give a rotterdam is a great blue silver color.  A perfect neutral for an formal evening and everyday wear.  I using it to transition into fall.  It&#x27;s just enough color to help you reflect on a great summer without being to flashy for fall.  It was long lasting as well.  It kept for almost two weeks on natural nails that don&#x27;t get babied.  Can&#x27;t say enough.  You won&#x27;t regret this choice!</li>
    <li> This is a great collection and this color is particularly lovely, got lots of comments on it, it is already on loan to my daughter in law!</li>
    <li> the color is really  nice. wasn&#x27;t sure if it would look good on darker skin but it does. love the gold specks</li>
    <li> Sort of like a steel blue. I purchased this color along with 2 other colors for Christmas gifts and ended up keeping this one for myself. Shipping took longer than expected, but it was Christmas time and I received my order on the 24th.</li>
    <li> pretty color in sunlight</li>
    <li> Came on time. Great shape. Love the color. Had my nails done in a nail salon with this color and absolutely loved how it looked with 2 coats. So I had to buy it to have at home.</li>
    <li> i love this color. its a steel blue and it really sparkles. it goes on easy, covers well in 2 coats.</li>
    <li> VERY PRETTY!!! LOVE IT!!!!!! GREAT color!!!!</li>
    <li> This color is so subtle and quiet.  Blue normally wouldn&#x27;t be a go-to color but this is amazingly neutral.  It really does go with everything.</li>
    <li> It is not a solid color as I thought it would be. It&#x27;s a pale blue with shimmery stuff in it.... I really don&#x27;t like it. Even putting on multiple layers doesn&#x27;t make it any better..</li>
