      <li>but I&#x27;m not going to fret too much; it still smells nice</li>
      <li>I just thought my granddaughter would enjoy looking around.</li>
      <li>Only make sure to use a good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Makes my face clean, smooth &amp; refreshed.</li>
      <li>I bought this product at Sam&#x27;s, mainly because I liked the lady&#x27;s pitch who was selling it.  </li>
      <li>I am excited about this product</li>
      <li>wanted to be sure I bought another exfoliating gel before I ran out of my first jar.  </li>
      <li>I fell youthful and clean after using.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure the lotion and other products are as good as any $1 product at Walgreens</li>
      <li>follow up with the moisturizing cream, and get a nice soft finish.</li>
      <li>My face does feel fresh and clean</li>
      <li>As I mentioned I have sensitive skin and there was much tingling going on the night I used and was very happy with the moisturizer-amazing again with the moisturizer-a nice thick cream that soothed my skin.</li>
      <li>Worth the cost.</li>
      <li>So the $89 was well worth it.</li>
      <li>But so far I love it.</li>
      <li>but it is so worth it.  </li>
      <li>This product gently removes it all, leaving my skin soft and flake free!</li>
      <li>and I do like a serum they have that seemed very much like a peel</li>
      <li>I used it the first night and immediately saw results.  </li>
      <li>This product absolutely works!</li>
      <li>Some people thought the &amp;#34;clumps&amp;#34; were coming from the gel itself and, I have to admit, that was my first thought also.</li>
      <li>My blemishes are gone and my face looks so clear and smooth.</li>
      <li>When I googled the product that is exactly what everyone else thought as well.  </li>
      <li>Good exfoliant are hard to find.</li>
      <li>, the stuff, not my face.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously it made a huge difference in my skin and truly did erase some of the tiny wrinkles by my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Curiously I tried this product and am so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>My skin looked and felt amazing-the whole day I got compliments-and I couldn&#x27;t stop feeling myself up.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot of this product om your face</li>
      <li>My mom is very into Avon</li>
      <li>but it would take too much time to explain that.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, which I prefer.</li>
      <li>I think that really puts people off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I suspect that the folks who complain about that may have used too much product.</li>
      <li>My husband bought this for me at SAMs and I was going to send it back as I have sensitive skin that breaks out from many products.  </li>
      <li>I know I&#x27;m extremely lucky to have clear skin and most people already assume I&#x27;m about ten years younger than I am</li>
      <li>My pours are clean and visually smaller!</li>
      <li>Long story short, I purchased the 3 count bag and the deluxe bag.  </li>
      <li>I had to ask for a another small test for my own assurance.  </li>
      <li>Now I have a new product added to my skin care drawer!</li>
      <li>The cost, while high, was not exorbitant</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear much make up and keep the cleansers and moisturizers to natural products.</li>
      <li>I think this is a good, not great, product.  </li>
      <li>Skin looks smoother-more vibrant, and so soft!</li>
      <li>So I decided to use a clear, plastic baggie (straight out of a new box) to test the gel.</li>
      <li>The young woman was very quick -- I&#x27;m not usually interested any sort of demonstration, but she caught me off guard and was into her demo before I had time to react.</li>
      <li>Next I tried the day cream which left my face feeling even softer with a smooth look.  </li>
      <li>This really will slough off dead skin and leave your skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to the L&#x27;Aveu facial products at Sam&#x27;s Club</li>
      <li>Some of the other posters have commented about the gel pilling into little balls, I experienced the same thing.  </li>
      <li>I love this, and I&#x27;ve used other exfoliators before and this is by far and above anything else</li>
      <li>Well worth every single  penny!</li>
      <li>Despite how great it worked because of my sensitive skin I was afraid to overuse it.</li>
      <li>A young woman in the store stopped me and demonstrated the L-Aveu gel on my wrist.</li>
      <li>My pores looked like they disappeared completely.</li>
      <li>I frequently do chemical peels that leave me with peeling snake skin for a week or&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a complete skeptic when it comes to any demos.</li>
      <li>My face looks so clear and feels so soft.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this. My pours are clean and visually smaller!</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Sam&#x27;s, mainly because I liked the lady&#x27;s pitch who was selling it.  I took it home and left it sitting in my bathroom for several days.  I tried it tonight and then did some internet research on it.&lt;br /&gt;I never wear cosmetics.  I have Lupus so I must be careful about what I apply to my skin.  Some of the other posters have commented about the gel pilling into little balls, I experienced the same thing.  I suspect that it does help exfoliate your skin as it pulls on your skin a bit as it pills up, however, the sales tactic of saying all those little pills were dead skin is  just that...a sales pitch. My face does feel fresh and clean, I am a little concerned though as I feel a tiny bit of itchiness, though I do not see any redness or irritation to my skin.  I used the day moisturizer ( a very small amount as suggested) and noticed that the fine lines around my eyes were much less visible.  It is not greasy at all and I suspect that the folks who complain about that may have used too much product. My husband really liked the fragrance of the product.  I think this is a good, not great, product.  Much to expensive to buy unless you get it on sale at Sam&#x27;s.  I won&#x27;t buy it at the regular prices.  If I see it on sale at Sam&#x27;s I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am the same as all the other reviews cause I also got mine from Sams on a promotion.  I should have bought 2 of the packages but I was a bit skeptical cause the other things that I have been spending my money on are worthless.  So my suggestion to everyone who would like to use this product please so because it is the most awesome facial products I have ever owned.  If they take it off the market I will be one upset lady.  Don,t let anyone try to convience you that you get the same results using  the product on your tennis shoes.  How rediculous is that?  I am excited about this product and I hope you guys are all just extatic.  I have great looking skin with no visible pores and with the proper moisturizer the morning or night and your skin will look better than it ever has.  Yes it is a bit expensive but it is so worth it.  Enjoy and never believe the negative reviews cause some people just try to make all people and products a bad name.  But I promise you that this product is so great you will be happy.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me at SAMs and I was going to send it back as I have sensitive skin that breaks out from many products.  Curiously I tried this product and am so glad I did.  I frequently do chemical peels that leave me with peeling snake skin for a week or&lt;br /&gt;more that no moisturizer or beady exfoliant can touch.  This product gently removes it all, leaving my skin soft and flake free!</li>
    <li> This gel go&#x27;s on your face clear but as you rub it in a circular motion it takes off dead old skin to leave your skin soft, and radiant to except your moisturizer and keeps your skin ready for makeup. This product is so good that I can&#x27;t stop touching my own face. Also the whole line of L&#x27;Aveu Cosmetics are great as well and I can&#x27;t wait to use them every morning and night from head to toe.</li>
    <li> I went to Sam&#x27;s one day and I saw the rep from L&#x27;Aveu.  I was curious because I&#x27;d never seen this particular product.  The reps were so nice and engaging.  She put the gel on my wrist and I was amazed.  So amazed, I didn&#x27;t believe.  I had to ask for a another small test for my own assurance.  My, my, it was the best exfoliating I have ever seen in the USA.  I compared the exfoliation to the Turkish bath results.  Long story short, I purchased the 3 count bag and the deluxe bag.  I used it the first night and immediately saw results.  Trust me-get this stuff!  Cheaper at Sam&#x27;s.  I searched it on their website-too expensive!!!!!</li>
    <li> I too like everyone else bought this at Sam&#x27;s.  I used it twice already and I can see my skin is smoother.  Best exfoliating product I have ever bought.  Now I have a new product added to my skin care drawer!</li>
    <li> I have rated this product 4 times.  It is excellent even superior.</li>
    <li> Love everything but the price&lt;br /&gt;I will order again</li>
    <li> My face looks 10 years younger after using this product. It takes just a tiny drop on each cheek, massaged lightly to remove the dead skin accumulated over time. I looked older than my 70 years with deep wrinkles on my face from weight loss. After only six weeks a younger me is looking back in the mirror. I did not need a replacement jar but went ahead and bought one because I did not want to take a chance on running out.</li>
    <li> My second purchase of this product.  Makes my face clean, smooth &amp; refreshed. Arrived on time with no problems</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hard sell and I don&#x27;t like to be bothered by solicitors.  So I went into Sams Club and I was in a rush to go to the restroom before I started my shopping.  The sales woman stopped me and wanted to rub some gel on my wrist.  Once I compared my wrist to the other, I was intrigued.  I ended up buying the entire kit with the facial gel, day cream, night cream and some other items for $89.  Once I got home I tried the gel on my face and could see the difference immediately.  Next I tried the day cream which left my face feeling even softer with a smooth look.  Thus far I have been impressed with this product.  I almost want to go back and buy another kit.  I usually spend $40 on the Loreal night cream.  So the $89 was well worth it.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  My blemishes are gone and my face looks so clear and smooth. Only make sure to use a good moisturizer. This product dries my skin a little.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but had to share my opinion on this product. The L&#x27;Aveu line of skin care is AMAZING!!  I purchased the complete line from Sams Club. I was very skeptical because I have wasted tons of money on different products in the past and never saw the  results they promised.&lt;br /&gt;  I am SO happy that I gave this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;I saw and felt improvement in my skin immediately! Not only my face but the neck and chest area that we 50+ women have a problem with!!  Very little is needed so it lasts a LONG time. Well worth every single  penny!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I can definitely see a big difference. I been using this exfoliating gel twice a week for 4 weeks now. My face looks so clear and feels so soft. I use Avon Anew Reversalist Day and Night Cream also. I am 40 yrs old and I get compliments all the time that I look like I am 29.</li>
    <li> I purchased this gel at Sam&#x27;s Club yesterday. Just to be clear, I almost NEVER go into Sam&#x27;s Club -- I find the entire &amp;#34;checking purchases&amp;#34; as I leave the store to be demeaning, irritating and a waste of my time. I had no intention of buying anything when I went inside. I just thought my granddaughter would enjoy looking around. A young woman in the store stopped me and demonstrated the L-Aveu gel on my wrist. The young woman was very quick -- I&#x27;m not usually interested any sort of demonstration, but she caught me off guard and was into her demo before I had time to react. I was impressed with her results and at my age, 72, thought it was worth a try. The cost, while high, was not exorbitant so I made the purchase. I was very pleased with results the first time I used it and then I thought to check others&#x27; reviews. Some people thought the &amp;#34;clumps&amp;#34; were coming from the gel itself and, I have to admit, that was my first thought also. I used the product four or five times on one side of my face and continually had &amp;#34;clumps&amp;#34; as a result -- at one point something rather strange happened but it would take too much time to explain that. But my skin looks great! So I decided to use a clear, plastic baggie (straight out of a new box) to test the gel. I placed the baggie on my hand and got some of the gel on the baggie. I rubbed, and rubbed, and rubbed, and rubbed, and rubbed, the gel between the plastic and there were NO clumps. I am left with this conclusion. There are impurities on my face. There are impurities on my fingers. As one reviewer found (but misunderstood, I think), there are impurities on one&#x27;s tennis shoes. As for me, I intend to keep using this gel. It&#x27;s the best exfoliating  gel I have EVER found.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too bad they use the b.s. line about the gel balling up and being all dead skin cells. I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because it sounds like a snake oil salesman line. I think that really puts people off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the balls that form are part dead skin and this stuff does work. Is it a life changing product? No. I have extremely sensitive skin and have experienced no problems. I wouldn&#x27;t pay the 40 bucks listed here, but I got the 4 item package at Sams Club for $59.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does remove dead skin and clean out your pores. It also removes oil and leaves my skin feeling dry, so plan on using a moisturizer afterwards. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, which I prefer.</li>
    <li> This is the best exfoliating gel I have ever purchased!  I was first introduced to the L&#x27;Aveu facial products at Sam&#x27;s Club wanted to be sure I bought another exfoliating gel before I ran out of my first jar.  I am able to use it twice a week for a beautiful, smooth and radiant looking skin and am never disappointed with the results.  If I could use it daily, I would!</li>
    <li> This really will slough off dead skin and leave your skin soft and smooth. I use it twice a week.</li>
    <li> Ok people!!! This product absolutely works! Have never seen such a difference with just ONE USE of ANY facial product! (Also purchased at Sam&#x27;s Club) After only 3 days of using their products-Was so freaked out about possibly running out of the products before the showcase event returned in 6 months; that I had my husband return to the store to buy me another complete set! Have had both my daughters try these products-Results are amazing-anyone who tries it is hooked. Skin looks smoother-more vibrant, and so soft! The exfoliating gel is amazing (BTW- No dummies.... this is not the gel clumping on its own. Definitely dead skin!-How dare you waste this product on your shoe?!). I must say while the exfoliating gel is the standout in this product line----All of the products are of the highest quality----Really impressed!</li>
    <li> After only three days, my children even noticed a difference in my skin. I LOVE this product and don&#x27;t think I will ever use anything else. My skin is no longer oily, the pimples I had are disappearing and there are no new blemishes. Extremely satisfied!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really very impressed with the results..I also purchased it at SAMs after a demo and was skeptical but after trying it could not believe the way it left my skin. I used it on my hands and face and have seen a dramatic improvement overall of reduced pores, softness,and even dark spots. I&#x27;m 64 btw. I&#x27;m planning on going back to SAMs to see if I can buy another promotion because after researching the internet I found out that it&#x27;s very expensive. 90$ just for the exfoliate gel and at SAMs the promotion is $60 for three products.cleanser moisturizer and exfoliate.</li>
    <li> I know I&#x27;m extremely lucky to have clear skin and most people already assume I&#x27;m about ten years younger than I am BUT it doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t have issues I don&#x27;t like about my skin. My mom is very into Avon and I do like a serum they have that seemed very much like a peel and because I have sensitive skin I only used once every other week but then I would forget and go a month without it.&lt;br /&gt;Then my mom raves about this and I shrug and give it a try. As I mentioned I have sensitive skin and there was much tingling going on the night I used and was very happy with the moisturizer-amazing again with the moisturizer-a nice thick cream that soothed my skin. I&#x27;ll admit I didn&#x27;t notice anything that night but when I woke up the next morning-OMG!!! My pores looked like they disappeared completely. My skin looked and felt amazing-the whole day I got compliments-and I couldn&#x27;t stop feeling myself up.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I really love about it, it&#x27;s almost as if it tells you when you need to do it again. Despite how great it worked because of my sensitive skin I was afraid to overuse it. Gradually, I felt the change in my skin, my pores opening and getting bigger and the oil on my skin. I did it again and the same great results but this time no tingling! Love, love, love</li>
    <li> The exfoliating gel works great. It is not horsh or grainy and does not leave my skin dry. I fell youthful and clean after using.</li>
    <li> Great product. Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> bought this when they had it 80% off at our local sams club. you don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot of this product om your face and it works instantly. the dead skin just comes right off. follow up with the moisturizing cream, and get a nice soft finish.</li>
    <li> Read reviews on MakeupAlley.com for more reviews.  I was approached by a girl at Sams Club asking if she could demonstrate this product on my skin.  She rubbed a bit on my wrist and told me the tiny clumps forming were dead skin cells.  The $60 bag of beauty also included lotion, makeup wipes and something else and I liked the smell of the product, so I treated myself.  When I got to the car I started to think those tiny clumps of &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; are probably just the gel congealing and balling up on it&#x27;s own. When I googled the product that is exactly what everyone else thought as well.  One girl did a test on the rubber sole of her shoe and the gel still &amp;#34;balled&amp;#34; up as if it was extracting oil and dead skin from her shoe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like I got duped on the exfoliating gel and I&#x27;m sure the lotion and other products are as good as any $1 product at Walgreens but I&#x27;m not going to fret too much; it still smells nice and I like the packaging.  I just want to give others fair warning before they shell out $60.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a complete skeptic when it comes to any demos. I don&#x27;t wear much make up and keep the cleansers and moisturizers to natural products. I didn&#x27;t necessarily buy into the dead skin demo, but I did like the results. Good exfoliant are hard to find. I also enjoyed how the moisturizer soaked right in, never felt greasy or residual, and the scent is light and pleasant. And the demo girl Janelke was a doll. I knew if I didn&#x27;t like it, I could return it. But so far I love it. I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s, don&#x27;t look it and am enjoying this product.</li>
    <li> After I purchased this stuff I thought, I had been an idiot and gotten scammed, tried a bit on my desk and it balled up like it had at the store, then I noticed how clean the spot was on my desk!  I used it on my face and am so in love with it!, the stuff, not my face.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously it made a huge difference in my skin and truly did erase some of the tiny wrinkles by my eyes.  I love this, and I&#x27;ve used other exfoliators before and this is by far and above anything else I have ever used.  Love it, love it love it.</li>
