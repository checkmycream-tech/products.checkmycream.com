      <li>I purchased this item at a discounted price and should have known better -</li>
      <li>As fantastic as always!</li>
      <li>Excellent perfume by Blue scope.</li>
      <li>A friend asked me to find this colonge, his favorite.  </li>
      <li>just received it over the weekend and can&#x27;t believe i&#x27;ve lived without my favorite cologne for 10 years...</li>
      <li>:) The box arrived intact.</li>
      <li>I was able to find a bottle in the Houston Galleria after Hurricane Katrina.  </li>
      <li>Products offered for sale on Amazon.com must be authentic.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m going order him one more..</li>
      <li>that is mostly an altered or knock</li>
      <li>We also encourage anyone who has a product authenticity concern to notify us, and we will investigate it thoroughly and take any appropriate actions.</li>
      <li>I am a fan of all the Davidoff fragrances and have many of them in my collection...</li>
      <li>This is a truly stunning mens cologne.  </li>
      <li>Zino davidoff and cool water fragrances are one of my favorite products!</li>
      <li>Well, it&#x27;s not the original!</li>
      <li>I honestly cannot remember if the Zino I first started purchasing 25 years or more ago</li>
      <li>Thus, I ordered it on the Amazon Marketplace, from a vendor named Fragrance Alley, who provided me excellent response time for minimal shipping costs, and at a per-item cost virtually identical to the Amazon Prime price.  </li>
      <li>My wife told me how much she loved the scent about   15 years ago.</li>
      <li>easy to buy it in Amazon</li>
      <li>Way to strong.</li>
      <li>I love wearing colones, and this one gets the most positive comments; plus my wife loves it!</li>
      <li>I am more of Cool Waters guy, so I gave this one to my dad.</li>
      <li>It is unique and easy on the nose.  </li>
      <li>Although, to my surprise Amazon.com made it available once again</li>
      <li>My girlfriend liked it so much that I had to buy some.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light woody scent is pleasing for men and appeals to the ladies too.</li>
      <li>you enjoy this fragrance</li>
      <li>If it is available and affordable, I will probably never end using Zino.</li>
      <li>I wore this fragrance in the early 90&#x27;s and loved it.  </li>
      <li>However, I can tell you that whatever this stuff is, it doesn&#x27;t smell good or masculine at all.</li>
      <li>, I highly recommend another AMAZING Davidoff scent is Relax.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice, strong masculine scent.</li>
      <li>Would not recommend this if you have had the original.  </li>
      <li>When are you going to  get the the original cologne</li>
      <li>This is one of the nicest perfume I use and thanks for making it available at reasonable and good price</li>
      <li>Bottom line - the scent is unique</li>
      <li>Nothing like the original that I was accustomed to.  </li>
      <li>Tried if couple times and noticed that the smell lasted on a couple of hours unlike the original will stick on your skin 24-7.</li>
      <li>But I can emphatically state that if the current Zino is not identical, then it is a remarkable similarity.  </li>
      <li>This is skunk water compared to the original stuff.</li>
      <li>Zino is definitely unique in the lot.  </li>
      <li>Bought this Cologne blindly it honestly smells like an old man.</li>
      <li>A couple years ago I have the opportunity to sniff one of the greatest scents, at least for me, it took me awhile to find out the name of it</li>
      <li>CVS Pharmacy was sued for selling counterfeit Cool Water because it&#x27;s still being manufactured.  </li>
      <li>I just received my shipment of ZINO Davidoff with great anticipation of my favorite Fragrance , what a let down when I opened it and used it for the first time.  </li>
      <li>embodied that they absolutely make me a very happy camper, particularly considering the relatively inexpensive cost of each bottle.  </li>
      <li>A check of Amazon today shows a large bottle, 4.2 ounces, is about $25.00 with Free Shipping.  </li>
      <li>It was a great deal on Amazon and the reviews, with the exception of a few, are quite positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the gates, Zino comes out with the woodsy notes that settles into a fresh outdoors oaky finish with hints of floral and maybe a touch of vanilla.</li>
      <li>This fragrance smells too overpowering in the beginning, but later through the day it mellows out, to a nice fragrance.    </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t think that they are making the original</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ll, received it a week ago and indeed they are all right.</li>
      <li>Here on Amazon if I remember right was something like 27 or 29 dollars...  </li>
      <li>Priced right and the fragrance stays noticeable for just the right amount of time (1.5 hrs) .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Zino is a very masculine fragrance, it&#x27;s old in time but still up to date in smell.</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers of this product on the Amazon website, I have been wearing Zino for decades.  Although I also enjoy other popular colognes (such as Joop, JHL, and Fahrenheit), Zino has always been my personal favorite.  I am very thankful that I can still find it online, via Amazon, although I am unable to order it for free shipping directly from Amazon Prime, since they do not ship colognes to Hawaii.  Thus, I ordered it on the Amazon Marketplace, from a vendor named Fragrance Alley, who provided me excellent response time for minimal shipping costs, and at a per-item cost virtually identical to the Amazon Prime price.  Now, a word or two regarding some of the negative reviews I have read by others, stating they feel this product is a counterfeit or a fake.  I honestly cannot remember if the Zino I first started purchasing 25 years or more ago smelled EXACTLY like the Zino I am buying and wearing now.  But I can emphatically state that if the current Zino is not identical, then it is a remarkable similarity.  The fragrance and the long-lasting capabilities of the current Zino are certainly close enough to what I think the &amp;#34;original Zino&amp;#34; (if such a term is even applicable!!!) embodied that they absolutely make me a very happy camper, particularly considering the relatively inexpensive cost of each bottle.  Counterfeit or not, I consider this Zino to be a perfect cologne, at a perfect price, and patently deserving of the 5-star rating I have applied to it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the recent reviews claiming that this is a knockoff version of the original Zino. I just received my order from Amazon. For comparison, I have a bottle of Zino that I bought in a department store about 7 years ago; and the new cologne that just arrived has a very similar fragrance, close enough to satisfy me. The bottle and packaging of the new product sure do look authentic, also, so I&#x27;m not sure how other customers are so sure this is a knockoff. One final note: I like the way the fragrance of the new cologne mellows on my skin some time after I&#x27;ve sprayed some on.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item at a discounted price and should have known better - it was a knock off - not the real thing.  Now I get to return it and reorder the real thing.  -You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I just received my shipment of ZINO Davidoff with great anticipation of my favorite Fragrance , what a let down when I opened it and used it for the first time.  Nothing like the original that I was accustomed to.  It wasn&#x27;t even close!  Would not recommend this if you have had the original.  I really don&#x27;t think that they are making the original, just got my hopes up.</li>
    <li> It smells like &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34;, but it is a nice one. I receive compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I not only have  an original bottle, I still have the miniature bottle that came with it that is half full. What I purchased is a total FAKE. The writing on the new bottle is not the same as the old one(the real one) and they don&#x27;t even compare in fragrance. This is not even close to the original, so don&#x27;t waste your money. Amazon should be ashamed for selling counterfeit goods.</li>
    <li> Bought it 3 times for my husband SEXY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Zino Davidoff for the past 15 years at least and it is in my opinion the finest Eau de Toilette ever. Being from Milan, Italy I&#x27;ve always bought it paying in Lire and then in Euros. Just last month I was in Italy and I almost bought the 4.2 ounce size. The actual cost was (with a 20% discount..) about 55 Euros that translate in about 77 dollars.   Here on Amazon if I remember right was something like 27 or 29 dollars...  Great price, great product and impeccable service from Amazon as usual!</li>
    <li> I started wearing this in the &#x27;90s.... then it was nowhere to be found in stores.  I searched for it for years, with no luck.  It was nice finding it on Amazon, and the price is good.  I really can&#x27;t believe Davidoff has stopped making this!</li>
    <li> very happy with my order</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and it is the best smelling cologne I have ever smelled. It is not the usual cologne smell. No wonder Johnny Depp wears this!</li>
    <li> After searching for the Eau De Toilette  I decided to try and get it via Amazon. This was a smar move and I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> just received it over the weekend and can&#x27;t believe i&#x27;ve lived without my favorite cologne for 10 years... IMHO it&#x27;s the most appealing and unique fragrance for men i&#x27;ve experienced! are u serious about davidoff beng out of production for 10 years? might have too hoard this stuff!!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happen with this cologne...I used for years but now looks not the same quality&lt;br /&gt;and really I do not happy because don&#x27;t smell likes the original.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years. and all what I can say, that it was and still adored by every women I went out with.</li>
    <li> Ugly and older smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my dad, and have found in the one time that he&#x27;s tried it that it has quite a strong smell, a bit stronger than I expected</li>
    <li> one of the best men&#x27;s cologne ever made.  hard to find, amazon always seems to have inventory at a great price.</li>
    <li> This is what a real man smells like.</li>
    <li> Excellent perfume for men. I am more of Cool Waters guy, so I gave this one to my dad. He liked it.</li>
    <li> I just give as a gift for my friend, and he loved, is his favored. &lt;br /&gt;Was easy to buy it in Amazon and I received it in time.</li>
    <li> A friend asked me to find this colonge, his favorite.  He had been unsucessful in finding it on his own in stores.  5 seconds on the internet, I&#x27;d found it, and the best price with your free shipping was Amazon.  Yes!!</li>
    <li> Wow!!  What a find.  I wore this fragrance in the early 90&#x27;s and loved it.  Once it was finished, I could not seem to find it again.  Sad, cannot begin to convey my state of emotion.  Although, to my surprise Amazon.com made it available once again and it&#x27;s just as incredible as I remember it.  An understated and masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy this fragrance, I highly recommend another AMAZING Davidoff scent is Relax.  Once sprayed one might think, what was this guy thinking.  Then, after about thirty minutes it transforms into a wonderfully warm scent.  Davidoff launched Relax for men in 1990.  It&#x27;s top notes are mint, lavender, tarragon, bergamot and lemon; middle notes are bay leaf, patchouli, jasmine, vetiver, heliotrope, anise, cedar and geranium; base notes are leather, tonka bean, amber, benzoin, oakmoss and vanilla.  This is a truly stunning mens cologne.  I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
    <li> This fragrance smells too overpowering in the beginning, but later through the day it mellows out, to a nice fragrance.    I have already been complemented on its scent.</li>
    <li> Literally the bestseller and product</li>
    <li> i liked the smell. very good at this price and i used to use this before and it is recommendable.</li>
    <li> A couple years ago I have the opportunity to sniff one of the greatest scents, at least for me, it took me awhile to find out the name of it but finally I did and on top of that I found it at \\&quot;Amazon.com\\&quot; at a superb price, can go wrong.</li>
    <li> Zino has been out of production for 10 years. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 25 years.  Please don&#x27;t buy this fragrance as it is in limited supply &amp; soon I&#x27;ll be the only one wearing it.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s not the original! But it&#x27;s close enough! When are you going to  get the the original cologne, That&#x27;s what  i am waiting for!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the nicest perfume I use and thanks for making it available at reasonable and good price</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is the real thing or not. Writing was different than on previous bottle. Smells good though and lasts.</li>
    <li> Bought this Cologne blindly it honestly smells like an old man. Way to strong. Pungent and spicy would not recommend for young men</li>
    <li> I got this for my daddy and he wants another one for the winter time and I&#x27;m going order him one more..</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I am a Zino \\&quot;hog\\&quot;. My wife told me how much she loved the scent about   15 years ago. I was a little disappointed years ago when I learned that it had been   discontinued. I was able to find a bottle in the Houston Galleria after Hurricane Katrina.  I just bought another bottle from Amazon. I now have a \\&quot;stash\\&quot; of two and half bottles. The  only other cologne that I like as much is Attitude by Armani. I told my wife that when I run  out of Zino, I will probably not buy any more, break the habit, and move on to other scents....  (yeah....right). If it is available and affordable, I will probably never end using Zino.</li>
    <li> I love it when I discover a men&#x27;s fragrance only after it has been discontinued. I ordered a fragrance from a different retailer, and they sent me a sample of Zino by Davidoff with the order. My girlfriend liked it so much that I had to buy some. I found it here on Amazon at an unbelievable price. It is a very masculine fragrance, densely woodsy, somewhat smoky, and alluring. A great evening cologne.</li>
    <li> Picked this up for the man in my life who has always worn it, but it has been difficult to find.  Nice gift for Father&#x27;s Day (or just because!)</li>
    <li> The box was open, and the box was crushed as though someone already used them. I ordered for a gift.</li>
    <li> I always loved this fragrance. Great value for the price. When I bought my first bottle years ago, it came with James Brown concert tickets at Madison Square Garden.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this and can never find it, except here</li>
    <li> Have been using it for more than 16 years now. Love its smell and the quality is always consistant. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Zino Davidoff on and off for years. It&#x27;s an excellent winter cologne, but I use it sparingly in warmer months. I receive many compliments when I wear this cologne, and keep coming back to it. It has a nice, strong masculine scent. I&#x27;ve bought it from many places, but found the best price so far on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I have worn this for years and still get compliments if you get close enough to smell. I use it lightly and it stays with you so if you buy some don&#x27;t bath in it less is more and ladies love it.</li>
    <li> Zino Davidoff is a great product for men. It&#x27;s light woody scent is pleasing for men and appeals to the ladies too. It has just enough alcohol content to act as a pleasing aftershave too; I don&#x27;t care for the oily rub-on products. My wife wants me to wear it everyday, so I am glad it also comes in the larger size spray. It was a great buy at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found many colognes that can compete with Zino Davidoff. The woodsy, floral scent is quite unique from other mainstream products on the market. It&#x27;s definitely worth the investment if you&#x27;re looking to break away from the cliche citrus scents that have dominated the market for so long.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite scent, a classic, is not easy to find retail.  It is good he can get it through Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> This fragrance took me and has had me ever since I smelled it on a colleague back in 1994-5. This Mexican guy from Texas, who was part of the team training prep cooks, wore this everyday and I finally mustered up the courage to ask him about it--he kept saying what sounded like Fino, but when I actually sat down with him and talked with him, he was saying \\&quot;Zino.\\&quot; This fragrance smells like no other fragrance I&#x27;ve ever encountered. It is woody, but with hints of gingerbread and chocolate--at leat that is how it comes off on my dark-caramel skin. If you are looking for a nice spring/summer/fall scent, this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s genuine or counterfeit, so I can&#x27;t add anything regarding the controversy among the other commenters. However, I can tell you that whatever this stuff is, it doesn&#x27;t smell good or masculine at all. It actually smells very effeminate, in fact. What you&#x27;re probably looking for is something more along the lines of Tuscany Per Uomo by Aramis (though this is sadly also out of production)---something with notes of woods and leather. You don&#x27;t want this terrible stuff; trust me.</li>
    <li> My favorite Cologne . I love Zino Davidoff. Drives the women batty. I will order several more bottles for my friends</li>
    <li> I have been using davidoff products for the past twenty years! Zino davidoff and cool water fragrances are one of my favorite products!</li>
    <li> was everything I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my dad, first off the shipping was supposed to be prime I ordered it on the 9th and it says it will be here on the 16th. So far I am not happy with this purchase at all his birthday is on the 15th and I will be giving him his gift late</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Zino for a few decades. A rugged musky fragrance and a little goes a long way. Very romantic but also slightly dark and edgy. Not nearly as common as Cool Water...and that&#x27;s why I love it.</li>
    <li> Priced right and the fragrance stays noticeable for just the right amount of time (1.5 hrs) . This stuff has been around for a good while and I came back to it after 8 or 9 years. It&#x27;s a Musky, earthy scent which if used with care will usually get you a &amp;#34; What&#x27;s that Fragrance you&#x27;re wearing&amp;#34; ?..Don&#x27;t tell them...</li>
    <li> Excellent perfume by Blue scope.</li>
    <li> My dad&#x27;s favourite parfume since, I don&#x27;t know, forever! He was looking for this parfume in a while, so he was very happy when I gave it to him for his birthday. :) The box arrived intact.</li>
    <li> Made a mistake purchasing from this seller. I read the reviews after i purchased the product. At first i thought some of the comments left by buyers was a bit harsh. They were claiming that the product was fake. We&#x27;ll, received it a week ago and indeed they are all right. From the time i opened the box, i knew it&#x27;s already FAKE. The writing was different from the original which i still have the bottle. Tried if couple times and noticed that the smell lasted on a couple of hours unlike the original will stick on your skin 24-7. Don&#x27;t buy this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money either.

    <li> This is not original davidoff! i&#x27;ve been using this brand for 25 years now and can tell the difference. i&#x27;m sorry i didn&#x27;t read the reviews before.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of all the Davidoff fragrances and have many of them in my collection... Zino is definitely unique in the lot.  I purchased this blind about two months ago and just got around to wearing it.  It was a great deal on Amazon and the reviews, with the exception of a few, are quite positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the gates, Zino comes out with the woodsy notes that settles into a fresh outdoors oaky finish with hints of floral and maybe a touch of vanilla. It is unique and easy on the nose.  I tend to be more attracted to the citrus base note fragrances, but the peculiar thing here, is that I like Zino.  It smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zino has plenty of potential \\&quot;Wow Factor\\&quot; - positive comments from the ladies.  Shortly after my initial application, Sweetie comments, \\&quot;Whoa - what is that..?? It smells great..!!\\&quot;She is a fan of the spicy/woodsy fragrances.  I also received positive comments from co-workers.  The projection/sillage is average, but you can definitely smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longevity is above average, lasting about 6+ hours on the skin and a little longer on my shirtsleeve.  The bottle is nothing extraordinary and the packaging is slightly above average.  A check of Amazon today shows a large bottle, 4.2 ounces, is about $25.00 with Free Shipping.  At that price and the uniqueness of the fragrance, you should add it to your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I give Zino 4.1 stars out of 5.  Bottom line - the scent is unique, it has potential \\&quot;Wow Factor\\&quot;, longevity is above average, and the deal is fantastic.  I definitely recommend adding to your collection.  Make sure you \\&quot;see the world\\&quot; before it is too late...</li>
    <li> I love wearing colones, and this one gets the most positive comments; plus my wife loves it! This is an excellent price too.</li>
    <li> Davidoff no longer makes Zino cologne. CVS Pharmacy was sued for selling counterfeit Cool Water because it&#x27;s still being manufactured.  This is skunk water compared to the original stuff.</li>
    <li> I have to declare that this ZENO has fake written all over it.&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying it for years and am very familiar with the scent, yet this one is extremely light in scent, DOES indeed smell like Zino, when you 1st apply it, but is FAR and between of the REAL thing.&lt;br /&gt;Beware of ANY fragrances made in foreighn countries and on the box you read &amp;#34;Distributed in NY&#x27; that is mostly an altered or knock off.&lt;br /&gt;Now you get the scent in Zino with this buy, but It wont lasts but 15 minutes where the real one only has to be applied once a day or so.&lt;br /&gt;So in my opinion this is an Imposter and indeed it states &#x27;Distributed in NY&#x27; on the box,&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware, but still a good price.</li>
    <li> I loved this cologne.</li>
    <li> Just like when i use to wear this . glad they brought it back ...LOVE THIS !!!!</li>
    <li> As fantastic as always! And a great price!</li>
