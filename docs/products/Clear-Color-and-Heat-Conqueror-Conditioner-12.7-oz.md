      <li>This is the excellent customer service that has kept me ordering from amazon over and over again!</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best conditioner I ever used, but for the convenience of shipping and price that cannot be beat, I say 5 stars!</li>
      <li>Great Price</li>
      <li>My hair smelled great, felt great.</li>
      <li>Scalp feels great, not itchy at all.  </li>
      <li>I awarded it three stars because it requires both the shampoo and conditioner to get great results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be sticking with these products Great Hair</li>
      <li>Works great in humid weather.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great value for your money.</li>
      <li>saw it advertised and it sounded great but it just&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>In the shower, it felt great.</li>
      <li>The shampoo works great</li>
      <li>but it is pleasant.</li>
      <li>I thought the smell was pleasant and the size of the product seemed in line for the price point they were selling it at.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>So the claim that the conditioner is good for the scalp is probably accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this was a conditioner that was surprisingly helpful despite its price.</li>
      <li>He mentioned that, while my cheaper shampoo smelled good, it didn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything else for my hair.</li>
      <li>The shampoo requires the conditioner for good results.  </li>
      <li>As a conditioner, it worked fairly well,smoothly out tangles and leaving hair shiny.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The claims this conditioner makes (give you stronger, more beautiful hair in just 7 days*;</li>
      <li>Over all, the packaging is nice, the scent pleasant, and I like the texture.</li>
      <li>the price, it&#x27;s a nice conditioner and a good deal.</li>
      <li>If my hair feels this fabulous on day 2, then I&#x27;m in for a treat!!  </li>
      <li>This product works amazingly for colored hair.  </li>
      <li>The cost is reasonable, that might be the best thing about this product.  </li>
      <li>after trying this conditioner for awhile, I would say it is a nice one</li>
      <li>Smells great, works very well and was a great price.</li>
      <li>It coats the hair well, smells pleasant, and seems to work fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall though, I would say that this is a good product that, given the benefits I experienced, is reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I have waist length hair that damages very easily.</li>
      <li>Very happy with Clear.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First I liked the package better than the pricey product I had been using.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d describe it as a very light perfumed scent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They have a nice scent that I don&#x27;t find to be strong at all.</li>
      <li>The consistency of the conditioner is okay</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner combo.</li>
      <li>Because I&#x27;m a conditioner junkie, I told you!! :)</li>
      <li>, don&#x27;t judge! :))...</li>
      <li>And I am pleased to report that this conditioner passed that test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I do have more frizz than with the Vidal Sassoon</li>
      <li>Five stars, I love it.</li>
      <li>So I read many reviews of this product before posting...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve struggled to see the difference between many of the brands, most of which charge more for repair style conditioner.</li>
      <li>What was most noticeable to me was that her hair seemed to have more sheen than before using the product.</li>
      <li>Does it smell good and is it worth the money?</li>
      <li>/&gt;Ultimately, if you can&#x27;t find the Tresemme, this conditioner is okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a bit of a conditioner junkie :)</li>
      <li>After about 1/3 of the conditioner is out of the bottle, it is a struggle to dispense more product.  </li>
      <li>I like more freedom in selecting my hair care products.</li>
      <li>and oh my does my hair love it.  </li>
      <li>But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market.</li>
      <li>But now I know for sure, my hair can&#x27;t handle sulfates.</li>
      <li>You would have to use more than a quarter sized amount to get any nourishing help for your hair.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo smells great, doesn&#x27;t have too much lather and doesn&#x27;t feel like I have to wash twice.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell and have tried so many conditioners</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m returing mine and getting more Bioinfusion.</li>
      <li>and I know you&#x27;ll just love them if you have problem hair</li>
      <li>I literally can&#x27;t stop touching my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is a point that my hair starts to go from beautiful and shiny and newly colored to looking more rundown and</li>
      <li>think it is safe for my color treated hair, it is nice, but nothing special.</li>
      <li>Now I myself can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve used it, but for a woman that&#x27;s had many hair treatments she has a pretty good estimation of how well these types of products work.</li>
      <li>My hair definitely isn&#x27;t more beautiful, and there&#x27;s not less breakage upon combing.</li>
      <li>(I have naturally wavy hair - and not the good kind of wavy -</li>
      <li>In fact, a lot of you probably think your hair is just fine using this stuff, healthy even.</li>
      <li>It has a very clean and flowery scent that is very mild.  </li>
      <li>I really love this conditioner, it makes my hair so smooth and shinny</li>
      <li>This is a wonderfully luxurious conditioner that feels like silk when you use it and it does give my hair some fluff and omph.  </li>
      <li>Trust me, your hair is much better off with something sulfate free.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK and not bad, but I need something more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It has a nice, light, creamy feel to it and quickly absorbs into the hair.</li>
      <li>finally something great that makes your hair feel so much better</li>
      <li>, it makes my hair so easy to manage and my hair looks healthier.</li>
      <li>I disagree as I have used some that are just awesome and make my hair feel thicker as well as tone down brassiness.</li>
      <li>Huh...well, decided give it a shot...other dry scalp shampoos, don&#x27;t have companion conditioners and quite frankly are good tools if you want to remove hair coloring from your hair!</li>
      <li>But here&#x27;s the important point.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;Oh great, this is going to make my hair go totally flat.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>(This makes me happy because they do not make too much outside of shampoo and conditioner...</li>
      <li>The smell of both the shampoo and conditioner is light and pleasing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It feels good when I put it on--a kind of silky feel and when you wash it off, I can really feel how soft and pliable my hair is.</li>
      <li>my nose loved the way Clear smells.</li>
      <li>I am surprised at the good reviews on here...</li>
      <li>Being an older woman who has had her her colored many many times</li>
      <li>Even though I love to try new conditioners, I always end up rating them against my favorite ([[ASIN:B000V9RRD8</li>
      <li>Tresemme Vitamin E Moisture Rich Conditioner, 32 Ounce]])</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know that I will switch to this shampoo and conditioner exclusively when I run out, but the price and free shipping (with Amazon Prime) certainly makes it appealing.</li>
      <li>At first, I liked it very much.</li>
      <li>there&#x27;s no going back to the old and the best thing</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the conditioner for a few weeks and love the way my hair looks and the itchiness is greatly improved.</li>
      <li>Everyone&#x27;s hair is different so used in the right proportion the conditioner provides great results.  </li>
      <li>so my hair has certainly seen better days.</li>
      <li>This is specially for color treated and damaged hair.</li>
      <li>RIGHT WITH THIS PRODUCT!</li>
      <li>so I should recieve the right product tomorrow!</li>
      <li>The sulfates really do damage your hair even more.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I feel compelled to write a review on this product because of the damage it has done to my hair. I have fine, thin hair and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest, this is not it!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE TAKE CAUTION THIS PRODUCT CAN MAKE YOUR HAIR FALL OUT AND IRRITATE YOUR SCALP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have issues with hair breakage to begin with and I just didnt connect the dots that this shampoo and conditioner was making it worse. But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market. FYI... if you scalp burns like fire for a good 20 minutes after getting out of the shower, it&#x27;s not a good thing!!!!!</li>
    <li> My biggest complaint about this product is that the bottle makes it very hard to dispense the product after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slightly crescent-shaped design of the bottle makes it hard to squeeze it anywhere but the middle, since the middle part is the softest area. So when you squeeze it in the middle, you end up expelling the air out of the bottle, and then after a while without any air in the bottle, it becomes impossible to get the rest out. Having to handle a slippery, wet bottle in the shower makes it even more difficult to exert enough force to squeeze the conditioner out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This starts to be a big problem about halfway through the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the conditioner, in my opinion, isn&#x27;t creamy enough. It leaves my hair feel \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; and dry. The smell is blah and boring, too. It smells exactly like circa-late 90s Herbal Essences.</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes my hair so soft and I have super dry damaged color processed hair! Love the smell and have tried so many conditioners finally something great that makes your hair feel so much better</li>
    <li> last night I tried the clean scalp and hair shampoo for damaged colored hair repair and the long strengths conditioner WOW what a difference in the texture of my hair..I walked into work and the compliments where outstanding some people thought I had my hair professionally done.. I also work with alot of Asian people the ones I work with can be very critical and opinionated their not a fraid to tell you if they like or dislike something. WOW is what I said when they all comlimented my hair that spoke volumes to me..... One lady wrote down the names of what I used and is planniong on purchasing these products also. The price is so affordable I purchased them both in Walmart for under $5.00 each both together is usually what I pay for one bottle of my old shampoo...Ahhh yeah I&#x27;ll be sticking with these products Great Hair Great Price there&#x27;s no going back to the old and the best thing No Frizz No Big poof. My hair is naturally wavy curly and thick..... I finally found a solution to my problem I can&#x27;t wait to get my hair styled to see how much nicer my hair will look good style great products I can&#x27;t go wrong!!!!!! All I can say to anyone out there considering these products is try them for yourself and you be the judge its affordable and I know you&#x27;ll just love them if you have problem hair</li>
    <li> Made my scalp dry and my hair began to have a bunch of flyaway&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Having a full head of thick, frizzy, long, curly hair, I was looking for a product that would help me get rid of those areas that were just too unmanageable.  I went to the Caribbean and the ocean seemed to make parts of my hair want to \\&quot;dread-lock\\&quot;.  While to some that may be cute, it was not appropriate for my work environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, I kept hearing about this product and wanted to give it a try.  The price was worth it.  I figured that even if it didn&#x27;t work at least I wouldn&#x27;t have lost a large amount of money as you would on some salon products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is the 2nd day that I have used this product.  It is amazing!!!  I got the tangles out with no trouble; nor, did I have to yank my hair out to get the dreads to unlock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot wait to get to day 7!!!  If my hair feels this fabulous on day 2, then I&#x27;m in for a treat!!  I am extremely thankful to have such a nice product to use without the expensive price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Unilever for bringing this product to the States!</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner. It made my hair so easy to manage after I blow dry it. I used to put some expensive leave in conditioner to keep hair moist, but I don&#x27;t need it after I used this conditioner. My hair looks healthier and shinier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried and liked the Clear Shampoo, but this Conditioner was a bit disappointing to me.  It just didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft and silky as what I&#x27;m accustomed to. In fact, I was convinced for awhile that perhaps I actually had two bottles of shampoo in my shower instead of shampoo and conditioner.  Basically it leaves my hair feeling as if I never conditioned at all.  I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of how this product smells.  To me it has an overpowering floral scent.  But this is also a matter of personal preference.  I like things that are more subtle in nature or are unscented.  It&#x27;s too bad because I do like what the shampoo does for my dry and sensitive scalp, but I miss how soft and silky other conditioners make my hair feel.  That said there is one plus in that using the Clear shampoo and conditioner together I seem to notice less oil and build up when I wait a few days before washing my hair again.  I do appreciate that since I have sensitive skin and try not to shampoo and condition my hair everyday.  However it is a bit disappointing that in order to get there I have to deal with dry feeling hair the first day my hair is washed.</li>
    <li> Target stopped carrying my Vidal Sassoon conditioner and, since I was in a hurry, I bought this.  It sounded like it had similar ingredients and it was for color-treated/damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a few weeks, I&#x27;m OK with it but not thrilled.  I do have more frizz than with the Vidal Sassoon I was using, although this Clear conditioner makes my hair quite soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some color fading, as well, but I can&#x27;t necessarily attribute that to the conditioner -- it&#x27;s getting brighter outside and I have only had the color on my roots touched up lately, I haven&#x27;t had the color run all the way through for a few months.  So I don&#x27;t think the conditioner is stripping the color, but it&#x27;s not helping preserve it, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been using this on my scalp.  I tried, the first day, and discovered that I had to use close to 10% of the bottle to cover all my hair including the scalp (I have thick, waist-length hair).  Decided I didn&#x27;t want to run through it quite that fast and have only been using it on the length of my hair and not the scalp.  I still have to use a fair amount, but at least the bottle has lasted longer than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is minor, and I won&#x27;t let it affect my overall star rating, but I absolutely hate the bottle.  After about 1/3 of the conditioner is out of the bottle, it is a struggle to dispense more product.  Even if you turn the bottle over and attempt to add some air to the inside to provide pressure as you squeeze the bottle, it&#x27;s still difficult to dispense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, my hair is soft but still a bit frizzy and this doesn&#x27;t really seem to prevent color from fading.  When the bottle is finished, I&#x27;m going to find a different product.  2.5 stars.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner combo. Shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry my hair and leave that squeaky feeling. Works great in humid weather. Best shampoo I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for a month to fix my overbleached hair. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. I will probably try something different.</li>
    <li> To start, I have processed, thick Asian hair. I used this with the matching shampoo WHILE I was still coloring my hair and AFTER I had stopped coloring my hair. I&#x27;ve probably used this brand and line for about 6 months. At first I really liked this shampoo and it made my hair feel soft, lightweight, clean and preserved my color. I have a lot of fallout in general due to having so much hair but a few weeks in, I noticed it was a RIDICULOUS amount that was NOT normal for me. I ruled out stress, had some blood work done a few months ago so knew it wasn&#x27;t hormonal or nutrition related and chalked it up to over processing... AFTER I had stopped coloring my hair (about three months ago) I still noticed that the shedding would not subside. I&#x27;ve stopped using both the shampoo and conditioner altogether and switched to the Organix brand and am not experiencing a lot of shedding. I&#x27;ve tried shampoos and conditioners from Redken to Pantene and this is the worst of the worst. I thought I was the only one experiencing this but do your research as I know my review alone won&#x27;t deter most people from purchasing this... but seriously, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> Not long ago I bought a superior expensive salon conditioner because I liked the irresistible smell and the way it left my hair -- manageable, not greasy, not weighted down. Then I tried new [[ASIN:B007RTR8TS CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Damage &amp; Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I liked the package better than the pricey product I had been using. This bottle stands up and is a sensuous lavender color. The opener works better than the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next my nose loved the way Clear smells. I was surprised that the two products smell almost the same. Since I usually am in a hurry, I didn&#x27;t leave the conditioner on very long, but it worked in a short time. Buy this one!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I&#x27;m not super picky about the kind of conditioner I use. I&#x27;d been using one by Joico, but was running low. So when I saw this in the vine program I ordered it. I like the scent, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hair or scalp, so all&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I use Damage Repair conditioner because I suffer from terrible split ends. I&#x27;ve struggled to see the difference between many of the brands, most of which charge more for repair style conditioner. Clear Scalp was different from these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I buy conditioner, I look out for two big things. Does it smell good and is it worth the money? The answer to both on these questions in the case of Clear Scalp is yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is only five dollars and comes in a pretty big container. It&#x27;s a great value for your money. I plan on ordering more of this conditioner in the future.</li>
    <li> I used Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Damage &amp; Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner for some time before I finally wrote this review. At first, I liked it very much. I am a conditioner junkie, and will give any new product a shot if it seems to fill the bill. However, my initial delight with this conditioner sent me running back to my other conditioners when I realized that the initial softness that I felt was being replaced by a dry, brittle feeling -- almost as though I had left soap in my hair. Not good at all! Furthermore, when I gently comb through my hair when it is dry, I am suddenly experiencing breakage, and this is NOT a problem I had before I used this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In essence, I do not recommend this product, and I am glad that I waited long enough to have gone almost through the entire bottle so that I could be sure about my results. FYI, I always thoroughly rinse my hair out in the shower, but the residue from Clear Scalp &amp; Hair seems almost impossible to get out.</li>
    <li> I started with just the shampoo first and instantly regretted it. The shampoo requires the conditioner for good results.  The conditioner is very thick and feels oily but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily. It definitely makes it very sleek, soft and silky to the touch. It also takes the frizz out of your hair (if you have trouble with that like I do) but doesn&#x27;t make it limp like some shampoo/conditioner&#x27;s do. The smell of both the shampoo and conditioner is light and pleasing. It&#x27;s not fruity or floral. I&#x27;d describe it as a very light perfumed scent.&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t know that I will switch to this shampoo and conditioner exclusively when I run out, but the price and free shipping (with Amazon Prime) certainly makes it appealing. I awarded it three stars because it requires both the shampoo and conditioner to get great results. I like more freedom in selecting my hair care products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a conditioner junkie :) I love to try lots of scents and &#x27;promises&#x27; with different conditioners, so I will rate this on the following that I go by for myself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: Five stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Five stars, I love it. I even let my hair dry naturally a few times so that I could enjoy the scent longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioning during shower: This did great for making my hair easy to comb through before I dried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioning overall: Not so much. Even though I love to try new conditioners, I always end up rating them against my favorite ([[ASIN:B000V9RRD8 Tresemme Vitamin E Moisture Rich Conditioner, 32 Ounce]]) and it doesn&#x27;t come close. Before I dried my hair, things looked good. My hair smelled great, felt great. But after I dried it, it already felt rough. Hours later it was hard to believe I had conditioned my (colored) hair at all. With the Tresemme my hair is baby soft, and I mean that literally, I can&#x27;t stop touching it. I guess the rule here is why change when something works? Because I&#x27;m a conditioner junkie, I told you!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, if you can&#x27;t find the Tresemme, this conditioner is okay.</li>
    <li> I got both the shampoo and conditioner in the Damage &amp; Color repair and so far I really like them both. They have a nice scent that I don&#x27;t find to be strong at all. This conditioner leaves my hair very soft and smooth. I can&#x27;t say I see a difference in my scalp from any other kind of shampoo and conditioner that I use but the price is right so I would probably buy this again.</li>
    <li> Some might say a conditioner is just a conditioner...all the same. I disagree as I have used some that are just awesome and make my hair feel thicker as well as tone down brassiness. That said, this conditioner did nothing for my blonde hair and after using 3/4 of a bottle, I didn&#x27;t notice any \\&quot;repair\\&quot; to speak of.  Nondescript.</li>
    <li> I have color treated hair and wanted to try this conditioner in combination with [[ASIN:B007RTR898 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]] in hopes of keeping damage from color treatments at a minimum.  The shampoo works great and I continue to use it but this conditioner leaves my hair frizzy and unmanageable.  I wondered if the combination of the two was causing my problems but I have since used the conditioner with [[ASIN:B0019D8MUC Alberto VO5 Tea Therapy Healthful Green Tea Smoothing Shampoo, 15 Ounce]] and my hair is still frizzy and unmanageable so it&#x27;s not my shampoo causing the problem.  Something in the conditioner doesn&#x27;t agree with my hair and I do not like it.</li>
    <li> I have thick straight hair that was colored a few months before I tried this product. Over all, the packaging is nice, the scent pleasant, and I like the texture. However, I don&#x27;t find this conditioner as moisturizing as my standards - Dove and Tresemme. My hair just feels coarser and drier after using this as compared to my regular products. It&#x27;s OK and not bad, but I need something more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I started using the Clear hair care line after seeing commercials because I have extrely oily scalp with brittle dry damaged hair. I also suffer from hair loss that has accelerated since having my daughter. I dye my hair regularly and used to work in a hair salon so my hair has certainly seen better days. The Clear line is the first line I&#x27;ve seen improvement with balancing my hair from root to tip. It&#x27;s also the only line that I&#x27;ve seen less daily hair shedding with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product because it is far cheaper on here with prime than it is at the grocery store and I wanted to test ordering it online before starting a subscribe and save automatic ordering subscription. I received the wrong conditioner in a bag today labeled as the Color and Damage repair. I contacted Amazon and the customer serivice representative Amanda has shipped the correct one on one day shipping for me so I should recieve the right product tomorrow! She was very understanding that colored hair needed the right products to ensure protection of the color from fading. This is the excellent customer service that has kept me ordering from amazon over and over again!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the conditioner did anything for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I saw it advertised and it sounded great but it just&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> I had to use up my first bottles and buy it again to know if it was a chance encounter or bad design.  The condition is hard to get out of the bottle when it is about 1/3 gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is safe for my color treated hair, it is nice, but nothing special.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works very well and was a great price. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best conditioner I ever used, but for the convenience of shipping and price that cannot be beat, I say 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I was unable to continue to use this conditioner due to the extremely strong, perfumey scent. And in addition, I didn&#x27;t really feel like it condutioned that well. My hair felt very dry afterwards. Sorry to say--this product ended up being thrown away.</li>
    <li> I am surprised at the good reviews on here...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Bioinfusion on my hair because it contained no sulfates. I knew I needed something gentle for my hair because it is EXTREMELY damaged. I&#x27;m always dying it and heat-styling it. My hair seemed to be holding pretty well with Bioinfusion so I THOUGHT it coul handle sulfates again. Although this conditioner does contain sulfates, it says that it nourishes damaged hair. So I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. In the shower, it felt great. After my hair air dryed, it became extremey frizzy. But, that&#x27;s somewhat normal. But when I looked in the mirror I was shocked. My hair looked fried. It actually looked like I&#x27;d been straightening it all day. It looked limp, lifeless, and it felt so coarse and dead. Other people don&#x27;t always notice this type of thing. And hey, if your hair isn&#x27;t super damaged like mine, it probably doesn&#x27;t matter for you. But now I know for sure, my hair can&#x27;t handle sulfates. In fact, a lot of you probably think your hair is just fine using this stuff, healthy even. But if you used Bioinfusion or something else with no sulfates, you would realize that your hair could be so much healthier. The sulfates really do damage your hair even more. Trust me, your hair is much better off with something sulfate free. I still don&#x27;t understand why something that is supposed to nourish your damaged hair contains sulfates anyway. But whatever. I&#x27;m returing mine and getting more Bioinfusion. I don&#x27;t need to damage my hair anymore.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell a lot of difference from my regular salon conditioner - not a bad product just hasn&#x27;t shown me anything special.</li>
    <li> This product works amazingly for colored hair.  When I first started using it, it made my hair so smooth and shiny.  Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year, I think it&#x27;s time to give my scalp a change.  Plus I no longer color my hair.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length medium to thin hair. Weighing it down with heavy conditioners that cause it to look even thinner is unacceptable.  Additionally, within the last year I noticed that a couple of areas on my scalp were itchy. So, I was curious to see if this product would soothe the itch and condition without making my hair droop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I am impressed. I&#x27;ve been using the conditioner for a few weeks and love the way my hair looks and the itchiness is greatly improved. I use about a quarter-sized dollop and focus on the ends of my hair with the majority but then run my palms over my scalp and wait a minute then rinse. The fragrance is mild and the price very reasonable. I will update my review if I encounter any problems.</li>
    <li> I believe I am permanently switching to this brand.  I have extremely long hair (to my waist) and it even moisturized the damaged ends without removing my natural curl.  It&#x27;s a pretty light conditioner, but manages to work as well as deep conditioner or a leave in variety.  Controls frizz as well!</li>
    <li> This bottle came and smelled so vile that I had to leave it on the porch! After a few days I could bring it inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what caused that, as there was nothing unusual about the packaging. The conditioner&#x27;s smell also is unappealing (though not as bad). As a conditioner, it worked fairly well,smoothly out tangles and leaving hair shiny. But it&#x27;s hard to imagine anything gentle and \\&quot;nourishing\\&quot; would smell like this.</li>
    <li> This conditioner does the job. It coats the hair well, smells pleasant, and seems to work fine. After using it rinses out well and my hair feels soft and manageable. I really can&#x27;t find any superlative things to say about it, it does the job without any problems. I will say that I have an issue with telling which is the shampoo and which is the conditioner because the bottles are almost identical and I always forget which is which.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really tell if there is a benefit to using this on my colored hair or not. Everything seems fine with this conditioner, nothing stands out as being wonderful or awful. I did not have any leakage like other reviewers have reported with the shipping of this product. The cost is reasonable, that might be the best thing about this product.  I do like that the product is thick and not a runny consistency, it&#x27;s easier to apply when I can get it to my head without having it drip off my hand.</li>
    <li> Conditioner has a clean scent, not fruity or flowery, just a pure clean scent. You do not have to use a lot of the conditioner to get results. I have very thick hair and only needed to use quarter sized amount on my hair for conditioning, using more than this amount made my hair feel weighed down with an oily feel. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different so used in the right proportion the conditioner provides great results.  The only criticism that I have is that the conditioner can be very hard to get out of the bottle. I really have to shake and squeeze the bottle to get the conditioner to come out.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and when I first put this conditioner in my hand I thought, \\&quot;Oh great, this is going to make my hair go totally flat.\\&quot; Unlike some other heavy conditioners, the result is soft, smooth, and not-flat hair. The smell is fresh and not overwhelming or obnoxious. After using it for two weeks I didn&#x27;t feel like my hair looked any better, but it did look a little less shiny. Pros: inexpensive and not too heavy. Cons: Don&#x27;t see any improvement and hair is less shiny.</li>
    <li> Ironically, my scalp was dry and flakey...no clue why...just as the advertisements for this product started to appear. Huh...well, decided give it a shot...other dry scalp shampoos, don&#x27;t have companion conditioners and quite frankly are good tools if you want to remove hair coloring from your hair! Nothing strips it like dandruff shampoos! But this not only in two uses, relieved my itchy dry scalp, it left my hair nice...and has been much gentler on my OTC hair color. I like the scent. I use both the shampoo and conditioner. Will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this shampoo since I saw the ads in the magazines.  Since I have colored hair, I was afraid of using a product that would dry out my hair further.  The shampoo smells great, doesn&#x27;t have too much lather and doesn&#x27;t feel like I have to wash twice.  The conditioner is a nice creamy texture with the same familiar fragrance, a little like Finesse.  Scalp feels great, not itchy at all.  Very happy with Clear.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this product through Amazon but at my local Target. I&#x27;ve tried the Total Care shampoo &amp; conditioner, Strong Lengths shampoo &amp; conditioner, AND Damage &amp; Color Repair shampoo &amp; conditioner. This review is inclusive off ALL of the products of theirs that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first bought the product (Total Care) I thought the smell was pleasant and the size of the product seemed in line for the price point they were selling it at. I purchased one shampoo and two conditioners (as I have really thick hair and generally go through conditioner faster than shampoo). After the first shampoo and condition when my hair dried I immediately thought that my hair felt softer than it had before ... which is saying a lot because I&#x27;m growing my hair out and the only non-color treated portion are my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stuck with the Total Care line through 2 purchases and then decided to switch to the Strong Lengths line when I started noticing that my hair seemed to be breaking more often or just plain falling out more. Strong Lengths had the same good smell and left my hair feeling the same but didn&#x27;t seem to be addressing my issue of hair breakage/falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just two days ago I purchased the Damage &amp; Color Repair line to try out. So far same scenario as before but I now believe I know why!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ THE INGREDIANTS!! The ingrediants for ALL THREE shampoos &amp; ALL THREE conditioners are EXACTLY THE SAME!!! How the heck does one work for damaged/colored hair specifically if both the Total Care &amp; Strong Lengths have the same ingrediants. Just seems like a pure marketing scheme now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one to waste shampoo/conditioner so I&#x27;ll finish out the bottles that I have purchased but I know when I&#x27;m done with them I WON&#x27;T BE BUYING THE PRODUCT AGAIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I read a review where the person mentioned that it seemed to take longer for their hair to get fully wet once they started using this product and I have to say that I agree with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOMETHING ISN&#x27;T RIGHT WITH THIS PRODUCT!ee with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOMETHING ISN&#x27;T RIGHT WITH THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for too long to mention... There is a point that my hair starts to go from beautiful and shiny and newly colored to looking more rundown and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after trying this conditioner for awhile, I would say it is a nice one, I&#x27;m not sure if it makes a difference with dyed hair but that&#x27;s a tough one to measure. It smells okay, rinses well and has a really thick consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the convenience of the container. It opens on the bottom and stands up solid. So it is always coming out from the bottom instead of having to be squeezed from the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s a nice conditioner and a good deal.</li>
    <li> This conditioner leaves my hair feeling silky smooth, no buildup, and very manageable.  It has a very clean and flowery scent that is very mild.  I use this with the Clear Scalp and Hair shampoo as well, and have noticed a considerable difference in my hair not feeling as damaged from coloring it.  It feels stronger and looks healthier than it did before I started using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of the \\&quot;Clear\\&quot; brand conditioners. Like the other ones I&#x27;ve tried, this one is lightly scented and I would have to say that I like the scent. I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the scent is but it is pleasant. The consistency of the conditioner is okay but I prefer thicker conditioners. It rinses out well enough and leaves my hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;I like that the spout is on the bottom because this helps the conditioner settle and makes it easier to get the last bit of conditioner out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Do not use this produce--any of the line ever.  Tried it, next day my hair was a completely different texture--very downy and too soft for a colored, highlighted adult&#x27;s hair--like a baby&#x27;s hair.  Even went to get haircut and apologized to salon person for the odd texture.  Then the fallout.  Oh the fallout.  My long, long hair coming out in clumps every single day.  Finally counted one of the handfuls and it was over 50 hairs at least 2x day.  I wrote a review and of course mine and many other negative ones have long been taken off their products on this site.  I lost so much hair that when I vacuumed my bedroom carpet, it wrapped around it and totally blew it out.  My husband had to buy a new vacuum, seriously, not kidding.  But here&#x27;s the important point.  After months and months and months of hair loss to my very thick hair, I remembered what another person said in their negative review.  Put vinegar on the scalp.  I got in the tub and poured it at the scalp all over and just let it sit for awhile recently.  No hair loss.  Did it two more times over a few weeks and virtually no more significant hair loss.  One or two or three hairs at brushing or shampooing max.  Wish I would have done it months ago.  Threw out the bottle long ago cuz didn&#x27;t want my visiting daughter using it and losing her thick, long hair.  Call the company to tell them they better go back to the drawing board.  Believe me, not worth the risk, not worth it!  PS I have thick hair and have used salon and over counter shampoos galore with no problem ever.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this conditioner. It has a nice, light, creamy feel to it and quickly absorbs into the hair. For anyone with dry or damaged hair, whether it&#x27;s from coloring, sun, pool or just naturally dry hair, this is the perfect conditioner. After using it, my hair felt softer, less frizzy and more smooth when I blow dried it. If you are someone who has fine or thin hair, you might want to apply it toward the middle and ends and avoid the roots because the oils in the conditioner might be a little too heavy for certain types of hair and weigh it down.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is really nourishing, but I can&#x27;t use it daily without it making my hair greasy. I have a dry, itchy scalp with oily hair...I&#x27;m not sure how that works, but it does lol. I use this conditioner every other time I wash my hair and it works well for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite now - hair and scalp feels clean, softly conditioned and hair is not weighed down - easy to manage..</li>
    <li> I have short color treated hair and oh my does my hair love it.  This is a wonderfully luxurious conditioner that feels like silk when you use it and it does give my hair some fluff and omph.  I haven&#x27;t had an issue either with this stripping the dye from my hair like I have with some conditioners which is a plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying the entire line of Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty products and have to say I love them all.  I will gladly pay the small amount for this than the large $$ amount for the shampoo and conditioner I was buying at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I feel is a nice quality product with an affordable price, nice fragrance without a yukky buildup on the hair and just an overall fantastic experience that will keep me using this for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> I have fairly thick, shoulder length colored hair that literally has a mind of its own.  A standing joke that&#x27;s only part joke in my house is that the hair I wear all day is the hair that I woke up with.  It really is that thick.  So one of the things I look for in any conditioner is whether it can make my hair behave.  And I am pleased to report that this conditioner passed that test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for three weeks and for that entire time my hair was amenable to the brush.  In other words, I got to have some (not complete but way more than normal) control of it.  I also noticed that I lost less hair than I do using regular shampoo and conditioner.  So the claim that the conditioner is good for the scalp is probably accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels good when I put it on--a kind of silky feel and when you wash it off, I can really feel how soft and pliable my hair is. The other nice thing is that it didn&#x27;t seem to discolor my hair more than regular conditioners do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like, quite frankly, was the packaging.  It leaked.  And, while this doesn&#x27;t sound like a big deal we have two very curious little dogs at home and about the last thing I want them to eat is hair conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I would say that this is a good product that, given the benefits I experienced, is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I do really like this conditioner for winter. I have waist length hair that damages very easily. It likes to split in harsher weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this conditioner, I&#x27;ve noticed less split ends, and my hair feels like it&#x27;s moister. Not wet or greasy, just not dried out. It&#x27;s very soft feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice, and it takes less of this than other conditioners which helps the conditioner and shampoo to come out closer to even. (I always run out of conditioner first) It might be a little too conditioning in the summer, leaving hair limp and conditioned instead of beautifully conditioned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring and blow drying my hair for decades and am always in search of that miracle conditioner for my neglected hair.  Having the opportunity to try this product, I jumped at the chance.  I have to be honest, I&#x27;m not particularly thrilled with this product.  After applying after shampooing, it didn&#x27;t have that creamy silky feeling that I normally get with other conditioners (have been using Garnier lately).  After rinsing out, my hair did feel a bit silky, but putting the comb through it was not a pleasant experience; lots of knots, that didn&#x27;t comb out easily.&lt;br /&gt;The claims this conditioner makes (give you stronger, more beautiful hair in just 7 days*; *due to less breakage upon combing vs. non-conditioning shampoo) fall short for me.  My hair definitely isn&#x27;t more beautiful, and there&#x27;s not less breakage upon combing.</li>
    <li> I have had dry, itchy scalp for years and no product has ever completely helped. After 1 month I am totally flake free and my colored hair is softer and healthier than ever! I have used it along with the shampoo and even my hairdresser commented to keep doing whatever I am doing. I have not experienced any problem with hair loss at all, and I will use it forever!</li>
    <li> I really love this conditioner, it makes my hair so smooth and shinny, it makes my hair so easy to manage and my hair looks healthier. This is specially for color treated and damaged hair. It really does what it promises.</li>
    <li> Like the CLEAR shampoo this conditioner is light and clean smelling.  However it is too light to offer much damage repair or maintenance of color for regular hair.  I used a quarter sized amount and did not get any effect; my hair.  You would have to use more than a quarter sized amount to get any nourishing help for your hair.  I tried using about four squirts of the conditioner; about a handful and had soft silky hair for one day; the next day my hair was dry and frizzy.  I really like the shampoos in the clear line but the conditioners</li>
    <li> I have used a couple of Clear brand products in the past and been very pleased with them, but I felt like this conditioner didn&#x27;t condition well at all.  I found myself using more and more every day trying to achieve the conditioning results I got with other brands.  My hair is about shoulder length and when I was using about 1/3 of a cup daily and still finding my hair to be dry, I decided enough was enough and went back to my old brands.</li>
    <li> I gave this to a woman in my life who is a lifelong salon shampoo and conditioner user and she said she really noticed a difference in the texture of her hair afterwords. The split ends were helped considerably. Being an older woman who has had her her colored many many times this was a conditioner that was surprisingly helpful despite its price. What was most noticeable to me was that her hair seemed to have more sheen than before using the product. Now I myself can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve used it, but for a woman that&#x27;s had many hair treatments she has a pretty good estimation of how well these types of products work. I&#x27;d recommend a sample.</li>
    <li> So I read many reviews of this product before posting...mainly because I was surprised at the amount of 1, 2 and 3 stars that it has received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I have always been a budget buyer (I&#x27;m still in my 20&#x27;s, don&#x27;t judge! :))...and my other half told me one day that my hair looked dull, dry and, well, crappy. He mentioned that, while my cheaper shampoo smelled good, it didn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything else for my hair. So...I started researching. I found great reviews on all the Clear products (which, at the time, were very minimal). I have used the Clear Total Care for the longest time but recently had my hair colored for the first time, so thought I would try their color repair version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let me help with some of the other reviews I&#x27;ve seen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ODOR: I read a LOT of reviews saying that the Clear Damage Repair &amp; Color Nourishing Shampoo and Conditioner had a very STRONG odor. If anything, it&#x27;s the complete opposite. It has a pleasant smell. And, to me, it&#x27;s very underwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLOR STRIPS: I&#x27;ve had my hair colored for about a month now and have been using the Clear Damage Repair &amp; Color Nourishing Shampoo and Conditioner just as long. My color is still as vibrant as when I had it done...maybe the at-home color treatments conflict with this? I haven&#x27;t had any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHEDDING / THINS: For me, I shed less and my hair appears thicker. I have thin, coarse hair. Before using the Clear products that I have used, my hair shed A LOT, it looked dull, thin and wasn&#x27;t easily managed. Now, I shed less (I can attest to this because even the mister has made comments as how much less hair he sees in the shower and on the floor! :))...and I feel like my hair is thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRYING EFFECT: I&#x27;ve personally had the opposite effect. My hair was dull and dry. GROSSLY dull and dry. Now, my hair looks 10x healthier, shines, etc. I literally can&#x27;t stop touching my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that everyone gets different results and not every product is for every person. But I can honestly say that in the almost 2 years that I&#x27;ve been using Clear products, I took a month off to use a designer shampoo and condition that touted less shedding, fuller, thicker hair and I spent ENTIRELY too much money on it. I was so disappointed by it in a month&#x27;s time that I immediately went back to Clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note that, as mentioned above, my hair is stronger, healthier, shines more and appears thicker but I also do not have to get a haircut as often anymore! My split ends seem to stay away longer (I have naturally wavy hair - and not the good kind of wavy - so I shampoo, condition, dry, and either straighten or curl my hair every. single. day. So split ends are a given...and my every 4 weeks trim is now 6-8!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh! AND! When I purchased the Clear Damage Repair &amp; Color Nourishing Shampoo and Conditioner, they had a hair mask product too! (This makes me happy because they do not make too much outside of shampoo and conditioner...and I wish they would make a leave in of some sort!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the Clear Damage Repair &amp; Color Nourishing Shampoo and Conditioner...hope this review is helpful!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this conditioner! It does not work on my thin wavy hair that gets tangled a lot! Had to use lots of it and still did little condition on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on my two daughters with same not nourishing results!</li>
