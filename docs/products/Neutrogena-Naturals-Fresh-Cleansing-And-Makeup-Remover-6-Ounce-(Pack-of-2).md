<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the only gave wash I use . It&#x27;s gentle on skin and removes make up easily.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. Pleasant to use and with little to no fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans, rinses off easily and leaves no residue.</li>
    <li> I love using products from neutrogena so far and this makeup remover/cleanser really makes my skin feel nice and to me it smells like fresh apples or apple cider.</li>
    <li> This smells great and foams up nicely. It leaves my skin nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out or leave it oily.</li>
    <li> A little drying but overall I like it</li>
    <li> I saw this product in a magazine ad and was super excited when I saw it at my local Walgreens. It has not disappointed.  I have very normal skin, no problem with oil or breakouts.  I do get dry sometimes.  This product leaves my face feeling fresh and clean, without any residue.  A small amount foams up very well and rinses away easily.  I definitely recommend at least giving it a try. The only thing I notice is sometimes it doesn&#x27;t quite get all of my eye makeup off, but some of that could  be human error.  I don&#x27;t plan on buying a different face wash any time soon.</li>
    <li> I really like this face wash. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does not always remove all my makeup. When I get dressed up for a special night out and wear a bit extra makeup (especially eye makeup) I need to use actual makeup remover as this will not remove it all. I do like that this leaves my skin feeling smooth and it does not dry out my skin. My skin does not feel tight/dry after using it. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have an oily T-Zone and the sides of my face and nose are always super dry, so it&#x27;s hard to find a good cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out or over moisturize. This one is PERFECT! It gets off all makeup, and passes the after-cleansing test. I can swipe my skin with a cotton ball and toner and the cotton ball is CLEAN! I love this stuff! It also leaves my dry areas smooth and soft. LOVE&lt;3 buy it if you have combination skin!</li>
    <li> For reference, I have tan, oily, sensitive, acne prone skin. Not crazy acne, but I do break out with pimples if I don&#x27;t clean my face properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never tought I would find another cleanser I loved after using Lamas Beauty radiant C facewash. But that stuff gets expensive specially after shipping. So I was looking for a face wash that wasnt&#x27;s laden with nasty chemicals and this one seemed pretty good. I&#x27;ve had good results with certain neutrogena products before, and for the price I said \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m glad I did. I really like this cleanser. Does a great job removing dirt and make up. It cleanses without making me itchy or tight. And love that is 94% natural. No sulfates or parabens, wich I&#x27;m avoiding like the plague, since finding out how carcinogenic they are, and how they cause wrinkles and damage skin. So I&#x27;m sold. I love it and will continue to use it as long as they make it. I loveeeeee the smell. Can&#x27;t believe there are people that don&#x27;t. This smells like green apples to me, wich is my favorite scent. It smells clean and fresh, wich I love. Would prefer unscented since it is \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and stuff, but I actually like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really coment on its drying effects, because I use organic jojoba oil as part of my cleansing routine. I massage on my face before washing, and apply 2 or 3 more drops afterwards, followed by my night cream (which righ now I&#x27;m using 40 carrots and it is working great). So my face is moisturized and clear and very toned. So take that into consideration. Oh! I also use a toner before applying the jojoba oil and night cream. My skin is better than ever. I have absolutly no wrinkles, and I&#x27;m 37. Everyones jaw drops when I tell them. I always get the same answer, \\&quot;I tought you were 26 or 27\\&quot;. Haha, I love it!!! I look younger than my 20-something friends! (Of course, diet and exercise help)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 04/11/2012: Ok so I reviewed the wrong product. What I used (noticed past tense) was the Neutrogena Naturals Fresh Cleansing + Makeup Remover(but they have basically the same ingredients). However I have dicontinued use since I realized the product contains Benzyl Alcohol, wich is a known irritant (hence all the complaints about it burning) and a neurotoxin. Seriously? a neurotoxin and you dare call it natural? How good can the other 94% of natural ingridients be, if you put a neurotixing in your product??? Shame on you Neutrogena, you really let me down on this one. I really loved this product. It cleanses so well (which is why I left the 3 stars). If you don&#x27;t mind the neurotoxin, it is a great cleanser. However I do. I have since switched to Organique by Himalaya Herbal Healthcare which is totally natural and I&#x27;m really liking it. Cleanses really well. The scent is a little too herbal for my taste, but I don&#x27;t hate it. I will stick with that from now on.</li>
    <li> I was using Avalon Organics Vitamin C facial cleanser, but then Hain bought the company and changed the formula. It was awful so I had to find a new product. This one removes makeup even better and still keeps the pimples away. I like that it is a mostly natural product. I have very sensitive skin that is prone to irritant dermatitis and this product did not cause me any trouble. I use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> this is the best makeup remover and cleanser. gets all the makeup off your face. LOVE IT! WILL DEFINTELY BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> I wear bare-minerals make up and this didn&#x27;t remove all of the make-up. When I would use toner after washing, a lot of make-up would be on the cotton round after cleansing. This made me stop using this product. Hopefully it works better for other make-ups, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work for mineral make-up very well.</li>
    <li> Works as well as Philosophy product that I was using which is much more expensive. This product has jumped in price over the last 6 months as well which makes me want to find an alternative to this one now. In the meantime - I love the product - not the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually not a fan of Neutrogena products. They almost always make big promises that don&#x27;t deliver. However, it is not the case with this product. I am in love! I have super sensitive, fair skin that reacts to almost everything I use. Not only was this gentle enough for my skin, but it completlely removed all my makeup without leaving my skin feeling tight or greasy. Seriously, there was zero makeup on my toner pad afterwards!  I HIGHLY recommend, especially to people with sensitive skin!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you can get the *&amp;###!!*&amp;^$(&amp;% bottle open. Neutrgena - Fix this bottle. I will not buy again until they fix this problem.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s naturally based and it does adequately clean the skin, but I don&#x27;t feel that it transforms it into healthier skin, nor do I feel that it softens my face. Smell is subjective, but I got tired of the smell rather quickly and I have now only begun to use it occasionally. I use Vichy face cleaner now and I like the effect on my skin and the nice smell.</li>
    <li> Bought this from Target I think and my wife says this doesnt work well enough and went back to using Vaseline to remove makeup.</li>
    <li> This product works well but has a harder time with black eyeliner and mascara (and not the waterproof kinds).</li>
    <li> The makeup remover feels light, not heavy.  After using it, my skin feels clean and soft.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This worked well enough but I did not like the smell. It was extremely artificial (watermelon gum?) for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my daughter who has very sensitive skin.  She uses it every day with her clarisonic.  It cleans her skin but doesn&#x27;t break her out.  It&#x27;s the first thing she&#x27;s used that wasn&#x27;t too strong and left her skin looking burned or that made her skin breakout.</li>
    <li> i like how gentle this feels and that it doesn&#x27;t leave me skin feeling too dry.  the smell is nice.  not too perfumey.</li>
    <li> Not good. I liked it at first. I used it on th evening to remove make up. Just concealer and powder.  Then after a couple weeks of using it, my skin started breaking out. Switched back to philosophy purity,  and won&#x27;t be using this kind again. Plus, it smells super perfumey.</li>
    <li> Works well for removing makeup and the scent is pleasant. I use it at the end of the day and then a milder one in the morning.</li>
    <li> Smells good, feels good on the face and takes all my makeup off easily. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I cannot imagine why Neutrogena would create a \\&quot;Naturals\\&quot; line and then add an unnatural fragrance that cannot be found anywhere in nature, or for that matter, anywhere outside of a head shop.  As soon as I put this product on my face I was overwhelmed by the cheap, fake strawberry-ish odor.  Have you ever smelled strawberry incense?  Okay, it&#x27;s not a perfect match, but this stuff strongly reminded me of it.  Ugh.  It&#x27;s not only unpleasant but overpowering and not even remotely \\&quot;natural.\\&quot;  I assumed a \\&quot;naturals\\&quot; line would be unscented (preferred) or very subtly-scented.  Wrong.  I smelled like a cheap candle even AFTER washing my face again with another cleanser in an attempt to rid myself of the smell.    This product is being marketed as a \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; cleanser that \\&quot;softens and refreshes\\&quot; and cleans with no harsh chemicals.  Well, for me, it was not gentle, and it didn&#x27;t soften or refresh.  It cleans, though.  It did remove all of my makeup.  It also stripped any moisture from my skin.  I have oily skin, but I do not use \\&quot;oily-skin\\&quot; products because they leave my skin uncomfortably dry and tight.  This gave me the same result.  I threw it away after one use.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive and oily skin, so there are few face washes that really do what I need and want them to do.  This face wash does a great job.  It&#x27;s a great, creamy wash that gets my skin clean without drying it out.  I love the scent of this product.  It&#x27;s light and not perfumey or heavy.  Although one reviewer mentioned that the scent lingered, I have never had that experience with this particular product.  It dissipates pretty quickly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a male, I do not wear make-up, so I can&#x27;t vouch for it&#x27;s make-up removal capabilities.  Nevertheless, it gets my skin clean without drying it out, so I&#x27;m pleased with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I docked this by one star simply because I have used a few face washes that I felt were a better fit for my skin.  (They&#x27;ve since been discontinued...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I like some exfoliation but can&#x27;t use a scrub daily (thanks to my aforementioned sensitive and oily skin), I alternate using this product every other day with the Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Pore Scrub, which is one of the best gentle scrubs I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> i liked most everything about this cleanser except why did Neutrogena have to include a fragrance?! it felt like i was rubbing cheap drugstore shampoo on my face - the smell was awful. PLEASE Neutrogena, make a Fragrance Free version - only then will it truly be Natural. At this point, the added very unnatural fragrance does not make it so. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again unless they come out with a Fragrance Free version then it will deserve the four stars i wish i could give it.</li>
    <li> Takes of makeup gently and great price</li>
    <li> I bought this while I was at Walmart for ten dollars (for one?!!?!) while its the same for two on amazon.. I should of done my research haha, but this was a purchase on impulse, because I heard some good reviews from a youtuber. First off, I would like to get it out that the smell is absolutely awful, and if you have sensitive skin, or is sensitive to fragrance, stay away from this. This claims to remove makeup, but it does not remove any of my makeup. Not my foundation, concealer, eyeliner, mascara, or lipstick. Nothing. I suppose it cleanses my face, but it leaves a weird texture on my hand afterwards when I rub in the cleanser onto my face. The texture it leaves on my hand is like leftover soap residue when you wash your hands with soap, but haven&#x27;t completely rinsed off the soap.</li>
    <li> What more can a makeup-wearer ask for? This is naturals (mostly coconut-derived ingredients), so I am happy with that. It&#x27;s gentle - I am happy with that. It removes all my makeup, including mascara and eyeliner - I am VERY happy about that. No need for chemical makeup removers. This is all you need to clean your face morning and night.    Addition to my review above:  I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Naturals Fresh Cleansing and makeup remover for three years now and have yet to tire of it. The product is so gentle and effective, has never irritated my skin, has never made me sneeze, and has kept my skin feeling soft and smooth after using. I have replaced almost all of my skincare, hair care and cosmetic products with naturals, and while there are other, more natural cleansers (containing no alcohol, etc.), I think this one is worth continuing.</li>
    <li> Sometimes, drug store products really are just as good as expensive department store items.  This is a great daily cleanser and makeup remover.  It has a very light feel and scent and it foams, which I prefer.  It leaves your skin feeling clean, without any kind of sliminess or residue.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Let me be clear, I love the cleanser and have been using it for over a year.  I have found it frequently sold out at my local stores, so decided to order here so I didn&#x27;t have to wait since i was running really low.  This was the first product I have used the amazon app barcode scanner with and that was cool (but not relevant, I know).  I bought the 2 pack, and NEITHER of the bottles pump tops would release so they were usable, I had to use the one from my old empty bottle.  This does concern me slightly that it is possibly not the same product available in stores, but the cleanser seems ok so far (I&#x27;ve used it 3 times with no ill effects)  That is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give 4 stars</li>
    <li> My favorite face wash.  Lightly scented, smooth, gentle and gets the make up off down to the mascara.  I do follow up with make up removing wipes for the eye liner and mascara that never seems to leave my under eye but that&#x27;s only because I need something thin and easy to run in this area.</li>
    <li> so good,will definitly order again</li>
    <li> Use this everyday to remove makeup.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and I thought I would give this a product a try based on many of the reviews that I read. I&#x27;m sure this product is magnificent for many other people but after a couple of uses it left my face burning. My face was splotchy and painfully dry for days. Needless to say I stopped using the product immediately. If you have extremely sensitive skin be careful with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a whim while I was in Target I was looking for a morning cleanser that would rid excess oil and wake me up.  I use this along with my Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27; skin cleanser and I cannot express how soft, clear and pore free my skin looks after using this. My skin glows and looks fantastic with my combination skin care routine! I also use this to clean my makeup brushes and it works wonders in that area as well. I am a happy camper and will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> The most complete cleanser I have used for makeup removal.  It thoroughly cleans without over-drying the skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this face wash. I normally try to purchase organic products for my face and body but have been unable to find one that will also help  to combat my cystic acne outbreaks. I decided to try this since it is mostly an all natural product and I have not been disappointed. I use it twice daily, morning and night. It not only feels nice on my skin but it has decreased my outbreaks dramatically.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, removes most of make up.</li>
    <li> I got this when I was on a trip and forgot to bring my makeup remover. I found this at Walgreen and fell in love with it. Good thing that it&#x27;s on amazon for a great price. My face feels really clean and all you need is just a little bit (not even half a pump).</li>
    <li> OMG do I love it or what! Its sooooo easy to take off ur makeup and clean ur face at the same time. And a little goes a long way. Buy the pack of two, its cheaper and trust me u WILL need a second one anyway. 😉</li>
    <li> Great face wash that removes makeup (including pesky eye makeup) and removes oils without drying out skin.</li>
    <li> This is staple for me. It removes most of my makeup and, is gentle for my very sensitive skin. If I wear heavy makeup I just wash twice and it&#x27;s all gone.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face wash but the pump is broken on both bottles!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the last 5 months, at first it works amazing. My skin is dry now and im not shure if this is the reason why as i use it every night but i will stop using it to see difference.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why but this reminds me of the smell of apples. Every time i wash my face i take in a deep sniff of the scent. I love that this product is natural and i love the whole line of products.</li>
    <li> I think I start to get acne!</li>
    <li> My go-to make up remover and it does a great job and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t use it for my eye make-up though because It burns a lot and isn&#x27;t as effective as the coconut oil that I use.</li>
    <li> Ok product but the packaging is rubbish. We don&#x27;t get it any more because its impossible to unlock the pump and no instructions as to which way to turn the pump bit to make it function the normal way pumps do. So to use you have unscrew it and use the pump tube as a dipper. Totally unsatisfactory.</li>
    <li> This works great! Great price, great product and i have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> nice cleaner, works good to get eye makeup off. Not drying or oily, not expensive, no irritation or break outs...can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> It is not a frash feeling,just like not clean enough.I don&#x27;t think it is good for removing the makeup.maybe i m not use to it.I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I tend to have difficulty finding facial products that do not irritate my skin, causing breakouts.  When this product first came out, I had a coupon and decided to try it.  It works great!  It completely removes makeup, and my skin feels clean and fresh.  The best part...NO breakouts!  I find that a little goes a long way when using it.  I use about a half pump to clean my face.  I&#x27;m still using the first bottle, so I cannot speak to how long will last.  If you are looking for a cleanser that removes makeup, including eye makeup, with no irritation or breakouts, I would recommend you try it!</li>
    <li> After 20+ years of acne I have finally found the only product that works for me...and it&#x27;s very affordable. For years I had tried expensive cleansers, refreshers...you name it. I picked this up one day on a whim out of exasperation almost 2 years ago. I now have a bottle in every bathroom.</li>
    <li> This face wash does nothing for me.  I mean, I guess it cleans your face, but I generally have to wash a second time with a different cleanser afterwards, in order to feel like I got all my makeup off.  Who has time for a multi-phase face washing protocol?  It also takes forever to rinse off.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a unique combination of this product and my hard San Francisco water or whatever, but I end up rinsing and rinsing and rinsing.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t feel particularly luxurious, and doesn&#x27;t smell terrific.  Kind of like a very mild green apple-ish fragrance.  I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s helped me to have good skin, and it&#x27;s not particularly user-friendly overall, so I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this seems to be the only face wash that does not dry out my skin or make me break out. It&#x27;s the only one I use now for about a year. It also washes away makeup and what not really well.</li>
    <li> great for both eye makeup and face makeup, this product was suggested to me by an esthetician.  All natural products leave my skin clean but not dry.  It&#x27;s all I use to take all my makeup off</li>
    <li> Love the product that it&#x27;s my 5th bottle. But as always the pump broke.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the natural title. It does remove make-up very well but I felt it irritated my skin. I have moderate to severe acne and it just made my face red and inflamed. I recommend this to someone without acne or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I saw a Make Up YouTuber I follow use this and I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. She claimed it was really light and helped remove her makeup and she was right! It is a good product to help remove make up. It&#x27;s NOT for acne though. I use this to only remove make up and then I go in with an acne cleanser after. Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this cleanser.  It takes off all makeup, even waterproof mascara, without having to scrub hard or rub, especially the eyes.  It is also gentle and doesn&#x27;t strip your face, leaving it soft and feeling really clean.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> The pump was broken when the product arrived</li>
    <li> It feels gentle and non drying on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This one is very moisturizing. Even more moisture than the Neutrogena Fresh Cleansing Foam, BUT IT DOES NOT REMOVE YOUR MAKEUP as it claims. So you might want to remove your makeup first and then cleanse your face with this cleanser it will help pick up the left over makeup on your face. But this alone wouldnt work as a good makeup remover! The fragnant smells a little too strong for me. But it works very well on moisturizing your face you can see the result aftet just one use. :)</li>
    <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s new Naturals skin care line is wonderful. I started using the Naturals Fresh Cleansing + Makeup Remover and not only does it remove my daily makeup quickly &amp; completely; but it leaves my face feeling soft, fresh, and full of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This light Naturals cleanser lathers and produces wonderful bubbly suds that makes it easy to clean your whole face and neck quickly and effectively without having to use much product at all. In addition the pump design of the Fresh Cleansing Remover allows for easy one-handed use in the shower, and is easy to pump exactly the amount you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena&#x27;s Naturals skin care line is packed with natural \\&quot;bionutrients\\&quot;, there is absolutely no odd scent, or filmy residue, leaving your face fully hydrated, fresh and clean with no breakouts.</li>
    <li> Love this! My skin is sensitive and this is perfect for removing make-up and cleaning my face.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but what is wrong with the pump?  I have probably purchased this cleanser 8 times, and of those 8 times the pump has probably worked on two of the bottles.  Even generic cleansers consistently have a better pump.  Now I dump the entire bottle into an empty bottle (of another brand) so that I can conveniently use it and not have to dump it into my hand each time.  Come on Neutrogena!</li>
    <li> I liked the consistency and smell and it actually removes makeup, unlike a lot of facial cleansers.</li>
    <li> After running out of Cetaphil, I decided to give the Neutrogena Naturals Fresh Cleansing and Makeup Remover  a try (I bought it at Walgreens.) WOW! It gently removes my makeup and leaves my skin feeling soft and non-greasy. I finally LOVE a face cleanser. This product will now be a staple in my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Very very good at removing makeup and not drying my skin.....it is a good non perfumery cleanser...try it.  It&#x27;s a good one. I am almost 60 and it works for me and is very reasonably priced...</li>
    <li> This review is for the Fresh Cleansing + Makeup Remover product (since multiple product listings are linked on the same page).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now.  So far, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  It gets off most, but not all makeup, so it is at least as effective as other cleansers I&#x27;ve tried.  A little bit goes a long way (something I&#x27;m having to get used to after having used a foaming cleanser for several months), and it doesn&#x27;t lather much, but it does rinse off cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an issue recently with a new mascara I&#x27;d tried -- I couldn&#x27;t get it to come off, no matter what.  With some trepidation, I rubbed this product over my eyelashes (eyes closed, of course) and rinsed, and I think it helped remove the stubborn mascara.  Plus it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  (I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for everyday use for taking off eye makeup, but in a pinch it should certainly do.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in the sources of ingredients in your skincare products, you will like the back of the bottle, which is pretty detailed.  (You can see it if you zoom into the current second product image.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have somewhat sensitive skin but have found this to be non-irritating and non-drying.  Although this is advertised as a makeup remover, and it works for that, you could also just use this as your daily cleanser and it would be effective (it has worked that way for me, certainly).</li>
    <li> Before using this product, I used a designer brand cleanser for my face because it was the only thing that didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling stripped or dry. I was bummed when they discontinued it and needed something quick, so I took a chance on the Neutrogena product. It was a big risk, especially because I have had bad experiences with Neutrogena in the past, but I bought into the whole &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; branding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great! I have been using it everyday for about six months now and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin. I also haven&#x27;t had any breakouts other than a stray stress pimple. The only thing that really sets it apart from the product I used to use is that it has a slight fragrance to it, but it&#x27;s pleasant and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. It also costs about 70% less, which I will not complain about at all.</li>
    <li> Great at removing my makeup, including mascara without irritating my eyes. I use it every night and my skin is clear. My sister, who has very sensitive skin and is prone to break outs has used this for the past month and her skin is visibly clearer. Would definitely recommend! I have naturally dry skin, so I pair this with Neutrogena Naturals Night Cream and that does the job!</li>
    <li> I was expecting the facial wash but this one also works! I thought it was going to be creamy but it&#x27;s actually soapy.</li>
    <li> Works great to get makeup off but is a little harsh for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased 4, not one pump works, breaking out around chin. Eyes feel like they are clogged, disappointed, I usually love neutrogena</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I wanted a specific &amp;#34;makeup remover&amp;#34; that would remove my mascara. I hate having to use a separate product for my eyes. The classic Neutrogena would not fully remove my eye liner/mascara and I&#x27;d still have some foundation on my towel when I dry. I found this and thought I&#x27;d give it a chance. I&#x27;m 36 and have combination skin, do not break out very often but the oily parts of my skin, like my nose, are pretty oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. I love the scent. It smells great to me - a mix of fresh apple and peach. I enjoy using it every night after I get home from work. I use two pumps, later and gently rub on my face/neck/eyes in small circles, then rinse. My skin feels pretty soft but does dry up quickly...I use a separate moisturizer. No irritation or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 4/5 stars because I wish it was a little easier to rinse off. You need a wash cloth for sure to remove all of the soap/suds. I do, however, feel it removes all makeup, even mascara (non-waterproof). Otherwise, I can see myself using this for a while.</li>
    <li> Wow!! I frickin LOVE this. Read the poor reviews on here and decided maybe I go to walmart and buy one. If I don&#x27;t like it I can return it, if I likd it then I can buy this 2 pack from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a face wash that will remove my makeup also, this way I don&#x27;t have to use makeup wipes followed by face wash then more makeup remover to clean up any smears from mascara on my orbital region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Testing this product I bypassed the makeup remover wipes and only used this. After using it alone ( without my clarisonic) every last drop of makeup was off and I had no need to follow through with anything ( then again I didn&#x27;t wear mascara today).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wiped my face dry with a white towel and no residual makeup on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it doesn&#x27;t remove my mascara tomorrow then I&#x27;ll still give it 5 stars because I think it removes makeup better than my philosophy purity which I needed to use with clarisonic after using makeup remover wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is a replacement for my philosophy purity cleanser which I wasn&#x27;t too fond of (3/5 stars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this neutrogena product!!!!😊&lt;br /&gt;Smells like apple, mmmmmmh love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I have normal skin type***</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now and I must say it is the BEST make up remove I&#x27;ve ever used! I already use majority of Neutrogena products anyway and love them and I&#x27;m glad to welcome this one to my collection!! I&#x27;m African American and it works just fine!!! Only use one small pump and it lathers my entire face!!</li>
    <li> This is the best product for organic cleansers. It&#x27;s cheap, it smells good, and it works. However, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the non-organic stuff. Although, almost no product does.</li>
    <li> works fantastic on my face</li>
    <li> very gentle face wash</li>
    <li> I love how this product doesn&#x27;t have parabens and removes make up with ease. I regularly use this with my Clarisonic in the morning and night. I didn&#x27;t find the smell off putting and it worked with my oily acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did agree with the other reviewers about the pump dispenser. I honestly thought how hard could it be to turn a pump dispenser to the open position. It was a lot more complicated than it had to be since it doesn&#x27;t click into place. I&#x27;m not looking forward to opening the second one.</li>
    <li> Gets off makeup with no residue left on your face. Pregnancy safe. No pimples!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Great!</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well on oily skin.  Have been using it for years, best stuff out there even with the price.</li>
    <li> The BEST makeup remover and cleanser I have ever used! I have tried all types of cleansing products including expensive brands like shiseido, Clinique, etc etc. But nothing beats the power and cleanliness this wash gives my face! I can even heavy intense waterproof makeup on and it cleanses it all! For the price and effectiveness it really can&#x27;t be beat. And it&#x27;s also made with natural ingredients and doesn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals and it soo gentle on sensitive skin I LOVE it! Been using it for the past 3 years and am totally sold.</li>
    <li> very thick, a little too heavy</li>
    <li> The product is great a does exactly what it says it does (not a inch of make up left on my face) and smells great to me plus this big mystery to the defective pumps are solve just press down on the pump and spin it clockwise and you will get the content out of the bottle :) so great product and recommend to all</li>
    <li> I usually purchase this locally -- Wal-Mart; Walgreens; CVS.  Occasionally I can not find locally so I then go through Amazon.  This cleans my face without drying it out.  I am sure it may not work for everyone as we all have different skin types but for my aged (53) slightly dry skin it works great and is my favorite for cleaning my face in the evening before bed.</li>
    <li> It claims it is &amp;#34;makeup remover&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;developed for delicate eye area&amp;#34; but it made my eyes sting worse than I have ever felt. I don&#x27;t know how they can claim this is makeup remover when you can&#x27;t apply it to your eye area without worrying about vision loss.</li>
    <li> Product was highly rated on Beautipedia for its effectiveness, ingredients, and price and beat out many pricey department store brands.  It arrived quickly and appears to perform as advertised.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash. Have been using it for a long time.</li>
    <li> i tried it once till now it seems good makeup remover it did remove the washable mascara very well leaving my eye area clean ,&lt;br /&gt;the reason i gave it 3 stars cos i received one bottle instead of two.</li>
    <li> This removed even my toughest mascara and I still feel like it&#x27;s gentle enough to use twice a day. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other make up remover cleansers, nothing works as good as this does. Other products I used would never remove all of my make up, after drying my face off with a towel it would like I didn&#x27;t use any soap and it would all end up on the towel. There is nothing on the towel after using this. It also smells good too, like a light green apple scent, nothing over powering. My face does feel a little tight and dry after using it but I always apply moisturizer after and it feels fine.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very good ,because it is too difficulty to wash out totally,i will not buy this second time.</li>
    <li> This stuff made my face itchy... Not tingly, itchy. I ended up using it combined with body wash on my body just to get rid of it. :-/&lt;br /&gt;Wasted money for me. Normally I don&#x27;t have problems with face stuff like that.</li>
    <li> my skin doesnt feel clean after i use it. its actually too mild for me. i was excited to try it. ive actually been breaking out more often since its use. ive reduced its need only to days wear i need to remove mskeup.</li>
    <li> The cleanser removes makeup without dehydrating the skin. Leaves skin feeling fresh and soft. A bottle can be used for months as one pump foams enough to keep the skin refreshed and blemish free. I don&#x27;t get why people have a problem with the pump I buy this item locally and online the pump does work all u need to do is twist to unlock then twist in the opposite direction and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Neutrogena, it does its purpose.  Price is affordable also.</li>
    <li> feels great, cleans well</li>
    <li> I am so pissed!:I bought 2 of this and SURPRISE! THEY CAME BROKEN! THEY DONT PUMP!!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser!!!! It gently takes off all my makeup, and lasts a super long time. I use one pump everyday and one bottle can last me months!</li>
    <li> It does the job for me.</li>
    <li> I really liked the texture and the foam when I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely reorder it.</li>
    <li> The back label says \\&quot;developed for gentle eye area.\\&quot; That doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case, because it made my eyes sore and puffy when I tried to use it to remove eye makeup. Didn&#x27;t find out til later that this is because willowbark, one of its ingredients, has naturally-occurring salicylic acid in it. It does mention that in the long-winded product description, but come on, guys - at least put that ingredient in the ingredient panel where it belongs. Lots of people have reactions to the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if it has salicylic acid, it definitely isn&#x27;t \\&quot;developed for the gentle eye area!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it has an oily residue that takes a lot of rinsing to fully get off. Double thumbs down.</li>
    <li> Item as described- two 6 oz bottles.</li>
    <li> I began using this face wash several years ago after being on accutane in my late teens/early 20&#x27;s. I started to have little breakouts around my mouth and forehead and was not happy with it since I had been on accutane. When I started using this face wash, I noticed those fine little breakouts disappeared within the first few weeks. I was so happy! I started using this because it was &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and I figured that would help my skin out. Although it was not completely natural, I used it for probably about 1 year. However, those pesky little breakouts returned and this face wash was no longer getting rid of them, Therefore, I started my hunt for another natural face wash and stumbled upon the brand Acure. I won&#x27;t go into that product since I am not reviewing it, but I would highly recommend the entire line if you are looking for animal and environmental products which are 100% natural and organic which smell good and are sold at a very reasonable price. Thus, I no longer use this product but was pleased with the results I got after using it for close to 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Price&lt;br /&gt;2. 97% natural&lt;br /&gt;3. Got rid of my fine little breakouts for about a year&lt;br /&gt;4. Foamed up very nicely for a natural product&lt;br /&gt;5. Sold in stores- no need to pay for shipping&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Not 100% natural or organic&lt;br /&gt;2. Stopped seeing results after about 1 year</li>
    <li> I use is as daily clneaser.&lt;br /&gt;As shown in the title, it is well cleansed and well misturaised.&lt;br /&gt;Usually well cleasing product makes my skin gets dried, but this is not.&lt;br /&gt;Also usually well moisturaised product is not enought to cleanse the skin, but this is not.&lt;br /&gt;So I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I found this stuff a couple of years ago and I still love it! The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, but definitely keep your mouth closed while lathering your face up because it tastes nasty. It works great removing all of my eye makeup, better than most products I&#x27;ve tried including the wipes from neutrogena. I usually wash with it every other day, alternating with Cetaphil so that it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out too much. I will say that I recently just went to arizona for a few days and used this stuff everyday with no issues.</li>
    <li> You will get a slight tight feeling after cleansing but all your makeup will be removed. I&#x27;ve used it for years and bought 4 this time around.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist suggested Neutrogena cleanser, and I found this in my drugstore.  A foaming cream that cleans very well and keeps your skin soft.</li>
    <li> I like this product, has no harsh chemicals, parabens, dyes, etc.  Cleans well and leaves skin smooth without drying.  I always use Neutrogena products, for me they work well.</li>
    <li> Ive tried plenty face wash but nothing beats this one. The best face wash !!</li>
</ol>
