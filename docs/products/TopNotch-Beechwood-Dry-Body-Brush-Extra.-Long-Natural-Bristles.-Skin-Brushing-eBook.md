<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So far so good, just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have always used a poof and thought with the winter months coming something else could be used.  I am happy that I picked this brush.  It shipped quickly and I am very pleased with the feel of the brush.  The bristles are not stiff and do not hurt .  It is very nicely made and I like the wooden back .  The strap is a nice added detail.</li>
    <li> Love this beechwood brush for the shower or bath. Has a strap for your wrist and nice soft bristles. Seems to be a quality piece.</li>
    <li> I was told recently that the best way to clear up clogged lymphs is to dry brush.  I have tried all kinds.  Some are too hard, some are too soft.  Like Goldilocks and the three bears, this one was just right. I use it dry and when Im done brushing, I feel invigorated. This takes care of my dry skin issues too.  The construction is good quality.  A wooden base, natural bristles and the strap that allows me to grip it tightly when in use.  It came with a cute terry cloth bag that doubles as a wash cloth.  It was a good decision for me to get this for a promotional price in exchange for a fair and honest review.  I have personally tested this product and this opinion is my own</li>
    <li> This is a great brush.  I like how it fits perfectly in my hand.  The natural bristles feel great on my skin.  I like to use it with an exfoliating scrub on my body. The strap is also helpful because it keeps me from dropping the brush.</li>
    <li> This is a very handy and portable body brush. The bristles are just the right mix of firm and flexible, to give your skin a proper scrubbing. I used to just lather up with the soap and leave it at that, until I tried a much poorer quality of brush than the one I am reviewing here. Even that one was better than just lathering. This one, however, takes it to another level. It has a strap to prevent fumbling and dropping. The only thing that could improve upon it would be having a handle so you could get at those pesky spots on your back, but I guess then it wouldn&#x27;t be so portable.  It even comes with a bag made out of towel cloth so it&#x27;s not rubbing against everything else when you pack it for a trip. Never leave home without it...  Disclaimer: I received the product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It is the perfect size, and works great!</li>
    <li> Great quality brush with firm, but not hurtful, bristles. It does have a strange sent. I&#x27;m sure it will go away though.</li>
    <li> Lighting fast shipping. Excellent quality product.bristles are just the right  stiffness. I love this brush.</li>
    <li> Brisk bristles are just right,  not too stiff and not too soft</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for dry brushing. It doesn&#x27;t hurt much compare to the other ones I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t shred and dry easily after cleaning.</li>
    <li> Loving this Dry Body Brush.  I have been doing dry brushing for a while because it not only helps increase circulation and get off dead skin cells,  but it stimulates the lymph nodes.  The natural boar bristles are the perfect length that allows just the right pressure.  Too hard and you damage skin...too soft and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing anything.  It fits in your hand so comfortably,  with a strap that fits around your hand,  that it allows you more control than if you had a handle.  The bristles are soft enough that it would be great to use in the shower too.  It comes in a cloth bag to store it in, that can also be used as a washcloth if needed.  Really happy with this brush and I have used it every day since it came.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for the purpose of testing and review.  All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Soft, comfortable to use and effective. This is the best body brush I have used.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush! I like this much better than those loofas because I can actually control what is going on. This just feels so great on my skin mixed with body wash. I can feel that this is helping remove the dead skin on my body. The added hand strap is a huge bonus. I would highly recommend this body brush!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to be that amazing, it&#x27;s a body brush. But it feels so good and just the right texture for using in the shower with dead skin from the cold weather!</li>
    <li> Not to soft not to hard and the bristles do not fall out in the middle of a bath like a lot of bath brushes do! I highly recommend this bath brush! The handle on it is the perfect soze for many sized hands!</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  I have psoriasis, and this is a perfect exfoliator.  Not to rough but strong enough.  Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Great quality in this brush and bristles are firm but gentle so you feel clean and tingly after use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this body brush and mitt. The brush back is a nice wood with a thick cotton feeling handle and the bristles are firm but soft and easy on the skin while exfoliating easily. It feels wonderful on your back. I have my husband scrub my back with it and it is fantastic feeling. The soft white mitt it came with feels like a cloud of softness. It is a terr6 like material but super soft and thick. I like to use it to help rinse off my body scrub. I have noticed a few bristles falling out but I think it is just bristles that weren&#x27;t in the brush to begin with. The brush isn&#x27;t thinning or anything that I have noticed. It is very full and thick with bristles. I just hang it on a little clip I have in my shower to dry. I&#x27;m very pleased with this brush. Yes you can use wet or dry but I prefer to use it wet as a srcubber in the shower instead of using dry. *Product provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and inspection. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Wxcellent little ite, ideal for travelling. Does a great job on rejuventing the body.</li>
    <li> Great brush however my brush was defective.  Quite disappointed.  Missing bristles.</li>
    <li> Nice brush, love the natural bristles.  Two years ago my husband and I started taking Epsom salt baths for detoxification.  In learning about detox baths I learned about &amp;#34;brushing&amp;#34; and how much the lymph system benefits from it.  So when I first got this brush &amp;#34;brushing&amp;#34; was first and foremost in my mind, however now I must stay I just enjoy how great this brush feels on my skin.  The brush is a great size and fits well in my hand.  Now to get one for my husband...</li>
    <li> Made very well. Come with nice bag to keep dust away. Quality product! Great Dry brush!</li>
    <li> Great quality.  Delivery was great also.  Would buy again from them.</li>
    <li> Very nice and well made brush. The bristles are nice, not sharp and scratchy. I like the strap handle, easy to grasp, very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Great quality brush! Got it for that notorious dry winter skin and so far, so good. I&#x27;ve only had it a few days but I&#x27;m really happy overall. Arrived fast and the bristles aren&#x27;t so crazy rough that they hurt, but it&#x27;s definitely better for getting the dry skin off than loofahs! The little loop is handy, too, and I love that it has the wood backing and not cheap plastic!</li>
    <li> I have always used a plain ole washcloth, but as I get older I needed something with a little more power to get rid of dead skin. This brush has worked great! It fits nicely in my hand and has a handle so it won&#x27;t slip. The bristles are not too soft or too hard, but a nice medium. It has really helped to get off the dead skin and rejuvenate my skin. The brush also has a nice look with the beech wood. It&#x27;s way better than having a plastic brush in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Soft bristles for a comfortable feel against skin. Also works great as a beard brush!</li>
    <li> The brush is palm-sized, maybe a little bigger if you&#x27;re a small person. The bristles are very firm, but not pointy or painful. I&#x27;m excited to scrub my husband down with this after Christmas! It&#x27;s perfect for grinding away dead skin cells and just feeling good.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to try skin brushing after hearing so many good things about it. Finally with the Topnotch Dry Body Brush I can start getting this deep-cleansing technique to work for me. I love the soft, white pouch where I can store my brush. This is a TopNotch Quality Beechwood Body Brush with Natural Boar Bristles for Luxury Spa Experience, Dry Skin Brushing, Exfoliating, Bath &amp; Shower Brush or as Cellulite Remover Massager. Definitely something that I need right now. Highly recommended to those looking to try skin brushing and reaping its health benefits. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I love it. I&#x27;ve been using it for dry brushing, and it feels great. It&#x27;s stiff enough to removed dead skin cells, but soft enough to not hurt or mark your skin. Nice, solid, construction, with lovely wood backing. Feels nice in your hand, too. Easy to hold. Highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Love that this brush fits on the hand rather than a handle.  I have more control and can use it on my face as well.  The bristles have  just the right amount of stiffness so they are great for body and face.  This is a very nice quality brush and I will recommend it to others who want to learn about the great benefits of dry skin brushing!</li>
    <li> This brush was just what I was looking for, it fits nicely in my hand and the bristles are not terribly stiff, they feel nice on my skin.</li>
    <li> Good brush - price is right as well; would buy again!</li>
    <li> I love it.  Already my skin feels so much better!</li>
