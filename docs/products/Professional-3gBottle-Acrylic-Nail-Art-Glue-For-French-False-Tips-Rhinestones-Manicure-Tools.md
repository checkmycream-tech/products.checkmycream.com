      <li>if you need nail glue get these!:)  </li>
      <li>just be sure to take your time.  </li>
      <li>I had to use a pin to poke a hole in each one to work and spilled some glue on my hand more than once.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really complain for the price and getting 10 but thought it would be good to notify others before buying.</li>
      <li>This item came very  quickly</li>
      <li>And yet another reason I give this 4 stars is cuz of how strong the glue is.</li>
      <li>it is really strong.</li>

      <li>cuz the glue was so strong.</li>

      <li>/&gt;super glue for a cheap price.</li>
      <li>Yes granted they were cheap</li>
      <li>All ten bottles of glue that I received were not that great.</li>
      <li>would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to buy great</li>
      <li>regardless of how cheap it is.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get 10 bottles for the price....</li>
      <li>i love love love it  works better than any other nail glue  </li>
      <li>is ok is 10 good quality is worth the money u pay for this thanks for sending it early then the date u say.</li>
      <li>It poured all over, I think that&#x27;s because I was a dummy and made a large hole in the top.</li>
      <li>the product may not contain full bottles of glue, as mine didn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>A much better deal then how much nail glue costs at box stores.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and as advertised.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t make the hole on top too big.</li>
      <li>dries quick after application</li>
      <li>got this really quickly the glue holds</li>
      <li>On the plus side it came super quick.</li>
      <li>It is SUPER sticky too.  </li>
      <li>and I was impressed on how long this glue is lasting!</li>
      <li>This glue is really strong and dries extremely fast.</li>
      <li>but it was worth</li>
      <li>this glue worked but is kind of once you open it</li>
      <li>I used it for nail gems and they lasted for 1.5 weeks on natural nails, I would say that is winning.</li>
      <li>I had to pop off the squirty top and use an old brush to dip in the glue to use it.</li>
      <li>I got some on my cotton shorts and right then it started getting really hot.</li>
      <li>This glue is fast drying and holds super well.</li>
      <li>I understand I didnt pay a lot for 10 bottles, but they really could have condensed them and been more realistic about what you&#x27;re really getting.  </li>
      <li>super glue sticks really well even using it besides nail art and</li>
      <li>so I decided to try these; and they definitely work better than the &amp;#34;other brands&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Look forward to ordering more in the future.</li>
      <li>AND IT DOESN&#x27;T HAVE A FUNNY SMELL</li>
      <li>Since you get so much though it is worth it.</li>
      <li>Nail glue is so expensive in the stores and buying in lots of 10 is a great way to ensure to never run out of it!</li>
      <li>I used this glue for the first time when I did my nails a couple of weeks ago to glue on the tips.</li>
      <li>good deal not a lot inside mostly dried out</li>
      <li>Bottles were less then half full glue qaulity is fair more like to not purchase again…</li>
      <li>but from other reviews its amazing.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ll first off let me tell you the first time I uses them the nails stayed on for a whole week(which</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is a very good price i was very skeptical but it was worth it came quick all secure and perfect for gluing nails and rhinestones dries quick after application</li>
    <li> All ten bottles of glue that I received were not that great. I couldn&#x27;t squeeze any glue out of them, even after cleaning all the dried glue out of the lid. I had to pop off the squirty top and use an old brush to dip in the glue to use it. Okay for the price, but not great quality and inconvenient to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give this no stars if possible.... I was so excited to get 10 bottles for the price.... as I do nails, however all ten bottles were dried out when I received them. Very disappointed. The shipping was on time however...</li>
    <li> Bottles are only halfway full, but with ten bottles for so cheap, who cares? Glue is strong and lasted me a week.</li>
    <li> Careful, this dries almost instantly but does not last long on my nails</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick well to your fingers.</li>
    <li> This glue is really strong and dries extremely fast. Be really careful. I accidentally got some on my thumb and glued it to my pointer finger. I ripped them apart which was a little painful but obviously the glue works really well. LOL It took a long time to get the nail tips off even after soaking in nail polish remover. It was a pain but I am grateful they stayed on for so long.</li>
    <li> Definitely a steal on price bargain.&lt;br /&gt;This super glue sticks really well even using it besides nail art and acrylics.&lt;br /&gt;It holds my acrylics on perfectly, but also isn&#x27;t super messy.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to buy great&lt;br /&gt;super glue for a cheap price.</li>
    <li> only one bottle had a glob of glue to use. every other bottle was dried out&lt;br /&gt;would put zero stars but not an option</li>
    <li> I used this glue for the first time when I did my nails a couple of weeks ago to glue on the tips. So far they seem to be holding pretty well. I had one of my nails come off a few days ago so I grabbed the bottle I opened and re-glued it for a temporary fix as I was on my way out, and it seems to be still holding as I&#x27;ve been very busy. Now that I have a few moments I thought I&#x27;d leave a review. It&#x27;s STILL holding, even after a few days! I think this is a good product!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t opened them or used them.  I&#x27;m just basing my opinion on it being glue at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This deal can&#x27;t be beat.  Nail glue is so expensive in the stores and buying in lots of 10 is a great way to ensure to never run out of it!</li>
    <li> The worst product ever it&#x27;s messing it just all pour out at once and it&#x27;s like you only get a few drops on bottle! Wouldn&#x27;t but this brand again ever!</li>
    <li> This is very strong glue and the bottle makes a good design for applying. If it gets clogged, a  pin in t he nozzle will get it unclogged in a second .</li>
    <li> Each bottle came with less than half full and i had to cut almost the entire tip off to get the glue out... i think it may have dried up during shipping or something... took like 2-3 weeks to get to miami</li>
    <li> NONE OF THE GLUE WAS DRY THUS FAR. I HAVE ONLY USED 3 OUT OF THE 10. SO FAR SO GOOD. AND IT DOESN&#x27;T HAVE A FUNNY SMELL</li>
    <li> Bottles were less then half full glue qaulity is fair more like to not purchase again……… not much more to say!</li>
    <li> I do my own nails  and this was a great buy for me , never have to worry about running out  when you can buy these in bulk  will buy more when I need to  Great  price !!!</li>
    <li> The glue is great I&#x27;ve only  used one but they will last me for a while ty so much for ur cheapest ithems no one can bet ur price</li>
    <li> I made some fake nails sets for some friends and, at fifty cents apiece, I bought these to give as a go-with. They&#x27;re cheap and plentiful, not needed past the first application or for a quick, on-the-go touch-up. But most of the bottles were not even half full, some of them less than that, one was completely empty. Also, at least two of the chemicals in this glue mixture are known cancer-causing agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They worked for what I needed them for but I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want good quality nail glue without risking your health, spend the few extra bucks and pick up a product called 5 Second Nail Glue. You can get it anywhere nail stuff is sold, usually. Use it sparingly and keep in mind that they say five seconds but they mean three. It will last you longer and perform better than this entire pack of ten bottles.</li>
    <li> This item came very  quickly but i was disapointed to find that not all bottles have glue i found atleast 2 of my bottle with any glue. The bottles arent completly full just halfway or less. I dont recomend</li>
    <li> Dried up quickly. Would not reorder.</li>
    <li> This was a good deal the bottles are a little hard to squeeze but I managed to get the job done</li>
    <li> this glue worked but is kind of once you open it you use it or lose it... I don&#x27;t think I would order again</li>
    <li> they are very watery as far as nail glue goes. It makes a real mess when you put it on. Most nail glue when you tip it over they dont run out like a stream. But they work in a pinch and they hold really good.</li>
    <li> Works great, very strong, i do my nails quite often, wonderful price and quality especially if you use alot of glue</li>
    <li> You pay for what you get. These all arrived with the bottle opening completely glued shut. I had to use a pin to poke a hole in each one to work and spilled some glue on my hand more than once. We all know that super glue on hands is one of the most annoying things ever, so if you want to pay a teeny bit more, go with a better brand and avoid the mess!</li>
    <li> I ordered these bottles and was expecting what I received.  Just to let you know the product may not contain full bottles of glue, as mine didn&#x27;t.  I tore the label off to view when I received it to see, and less than a half of bottle. So, if you are expecting full bottles, don&#x27;t waiste your time, if you realize that hey it&#x27;s still a good deal for the price, I would go for it.  Yes, I would buy these again, as I feel I got what I paid for. The nail glue hasn&#x27;t been dried up thus far, I&#x27;m only on my 2nd bottle.  I can say that the glue has held up and has been good nail glue.</li>
    <li> The glue works extremely well, once you get the nail finally set. It was hard keeping the glue on the nail itself rather than my fingers. It poured all over, I think that&#x27;s because I was a dummy and made a large hole in the top. Each of the bottles hardly contain any fluid, and some have more than others - a little inconsistent. However, for the price paid for 10 bottles I cannot complain. It works very well, otherwise. Probably will buy again. Note: I am only an amature, so any application issues are more likely my fault, not the product&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is the worst ever. I got home opened the package, and they looked empty. only had like a drop in them. These are terrible and i recumbent not to buy them. its a huge scam and a rip off. don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> is ok is 10 good quality is worth the money u pay for this thanks for sending it early then the date u say.</li>
    <li> this glue is great. i honestly use it on everything but of course my when im putting on my acrylic nails. there is 10 &amp; it is agree at amount for the price of this product. i would recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> Each bottle had maybe an 1/8 th of the product in it. You also have to cut the tip off down to the bottom to get any glue out. In turn makes it a huge mess to use. Don&#x27;t waste your money or time in this !</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all, it did not even have any glue in it when I got it either. It also took a very long time to receive the order too.</li>
    <li> Bottles came with only a few drips of glue in each, on top of being LATE! half the lids were super-glued shut! waste .</li>
    <li> WHAT A RIP OFF - WHERE&#x27;S THE GLUE????? NOT ONLY is there NO GLUE in them, I received FIVE - NOT TEN - EMPTY BOTTLES. DON&#x27;T BOTHER ORDERING FROM THESE SCAM ARTISTS - not unless you want to get VERY angry!!! RIP OFF RIP OFF RIP OFF!!!!!</li>
    <li> Some of the bottles didn&#x27;t have anything in them</li>
    <li> glue is horrible quality, i understand the bottles being near empty but if the glue strength is practically non-existant, do yourself a favor and dont even bother buying. regardless of how cheap it is.</li>
    <li> Seriously its been like 3 freaking month since I ordered this and the thing still isn&#x27;t here. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend ordering it unless you want to wait like 3 months.</li>
    <li> This glue works wonders! It is super fast drying, so you dont have to sit there for a few minutes and hold the nail. Just press and hold for about 5 seconds. I even ripped one of my shirts and was too lazy to sew it, so I glued it for now, and it worked haha. This glue is great for more than just nails.</li>
    <li> I received what I paid for.... They seem used; as some bottles were heavier than others and only received 9 and not 10 bottles as advertised. ... my husband used a needle to make the glue come out his fingers were stuck for a while.... they are not easy to use as they drop a lot of glue at a time I used this to add rhinestones to my nails and it was a pain....</li>
    <li> These are great.  I feel like I&#x27;ll never run out now, lol.  It arrived quickly and as advertised.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this item because of the inexpensive price, but it works very well. it is really strong.</li>
    <li> This is a grate sale 10 bottles here would have been 11 dollars and some cents</li>
    <li> these are good, glue is strong</li>
    <li> I guess this is where the &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; saying comes into effect. I got all 10 of the nail glues and in a timely manner,  however,  I have tried multiple times to use them multiple times and they just don&#x27;t work. Yes granted they were cheap but I did pay something for them so i feel they should at least work even if it&#x27;s half way. I have to squeeze so hard that my hands start hurting just for the tiniest drop of glue if I get any at all. So I would recommend paying a couple dollars more for a better glue than getting this product again</li>
    <li> Every bottle of this product was as hard as a rock and totally unusable. I can understand one, maybe, but not every one of them.</li>
    <li> Came early, all were accounted for. No special packaging but all were sealed shut and didn&#x27;t have any spills. Haven&#x27;t used it on the nails yet but will be soon.</li>
    <li> TOOK FOREVER to get here, but they are good.  Just a simple warning, the glue is like water in its constancy, so be careful when applying.  It came rushing out of the bottle and all over my fingers.  It is SUPER sticky too.  just be sure to take your time.  I used it for nail gems and they lasted for 1.5 weeks on natural nails, I would say that is winning.</li>
    <li> all the bottles of glue were dry and hard. I hate it waste of money had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the glue it has held the nails well. Holds the acrylic nails well very pleased with the glue. I would recommend this glue to any one I use it in my spa and very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> got this really quickly the glue holds really well i put some stones on 2wks ago and they are still holding on tight a must have</li>
    <li> This glue works great! For the price, I received what I wanted and more. I didn&#x27;t expect it to work as well as it did. I&#x27;ve bought glue at beauty supply stores that didn&#x27;t work as well and more expensive.</li>
    <li> it was all dry waste of my money</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like that you have to cut the tops off to get glue out. Makes it hard to use.</li>
    <li> I do my own nails and I was impressed on how long this glue is lasting! I will buy again</li>
    <li> This is very watery. It works but once you use it a few times the cap gets glued onto the bottle because of the &amp;#34;runoff&amp;#34; of glue. Since you get so much though it is worth it. It also spills easier onto the rest of your nail so be careful.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll first off let me tell you the first time I uses them the nails stayed on for a whole week(which for me is a big deal because I usually paint my nails every two to three days) they stayed threw showers and dish washing. However as time went on the quality of the glue diminished the longer the opened glue lasted(by opened glue I mean when you first get them you have to cut the tips of the glue to get the glue out then you cap it so the glue doesn&#x27;t dry up as everyone knows). But hey it comes with 10 so it&#x27;s all good. WARNING if this stuff comes in contact with clothes it starts to burn. It&#x27;s really liquidy so carful. I got some on my cotton shorts and right then it started getting really hot. I wish some one had here had given me the heads up. On the plus side it came super quick. All in all good product I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Literally every single bottle that I got came all dried up. Yeah this product is cheap but is it so difficult to actually make the product usable? Especially when all they have to do is put glue in a bottle.</li>
    <li> Not a very good glue at all</li>
    <li> I loved these nail glues. they work good. if you need nail glue get these!:)  Plus, its a great deal. i would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> The product is very good and the price is amazing.  Look forward to ordering more in the future. Definitely a happy customer. :)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten to try out this glue yet but from other reviews its amazing. But the package was just delivered and in the bottles they are all only a quarter full. Not even half the bottle is filled with product. I can&#x27;t really complain for the price and getting 10 but thought it would be good to notify others before buying.</li>
    <li> In the beggining it was great, unfortunately after 3 months even the bottles that were completely close, and never opened,  from factory were hardened dry. So it&#x27;s only worth with you&#x27;ll use it promptly.</li>
    <li> I brought this a while back and none of the bottles had glue in them, they were ALL empty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been unable to find my &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brand of nail glue at any drugstore...so I decided to try these; and they definitely work better than the &amp;#34;other brands&amp;#34; that I find at the drugstore.  These will last me awhile...but I definitely will re-order when they run out.</li>
    <li> When I bought this it made them about $1 each, which meant I can buy the nails at dollar tree and do $2 nail sets when I dress up. A much better deal then how much nail glue costs at box stores.</li>
    <li> I use this glue for full cover nails and it works perfectly! As long as you apply the nail and glue properly, it works like a charm. For instance if I hold the nail for only a few seconds the glue will only last about 4 days, if i hold it for 10 seconds, it can last well over a week. Only complaint is that it takes forever to get to me, but for the quality/price of this glue that doesn&#x27;t even matter. Will most diffidently be purchasing this again</li>
    <li> good deal not a lot inside mostly dried out</li>
    <li> The glue itself holds really well. Just make sure you don&#x27;t make the hole on top too big. I was disappointed in how little product each bottle contains. I don&#x27;t think any of them are even half full. I understand I didnt pay a lot for 10 bottles, but they really could have condensed them and been more realistic about what you&#x27;re really getting.  Would prob buy again unless I found a better deal.</li>
    <li> Not the strongest glue for nails... It didn&#x27;t last me more than a day until my nails started coming loose</li>
    <li> In love with these glues. They&#x27;re legit and can get the job done fantastically!! I will be purchasing more from this company!!</li>
    <li> its hard to  get the glue to come out so it cant be used.  Its a  waste of money. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> i love love love it  works better than any other nail glue  that i have ever used in the past twenty years</li>
    <li> for the price these little things do their job I will buy more&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend their very good I do nails for living so I know</li>
    <li> Really good product and the best price</li>
    <li> This glue is very good. It sticks well and it works as well as super glue (if not, better). The reason I give this 4 stars is because It says that you get extra stuff like rhinestones and stuff like that, but I got none. And yet another reason I give this 4 stars is cuz of how strong the glue is. I had to literally rip, yes I said RIP, the fake nails off of my fingers cuz the glue was so strong. One of which caused 1/4 of my real fingernail to be ripped off with it and ended in a bloody mess.</li>
    <li> I love that I can order a 10 pack of this glue for suck a great price. I bought this 10 pack almost a year ago and just ran out. I will only buy this glue because of the quality and the price</li>
    <li> This is a great product, and for the money you cannot beat it.</li>
    <li> Is the fake nail that you put on with this glue accidentally rips or falls off the glue will rip off like half your nail so be careful</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPPING WORKS WELL</li>
    <li> Great value. Great price. It is great for gluing on falsies</li>
    <li> This glue is fast drying and holds super well. I really like it, don&#x27;t think I will be switching any time soon.</li>
    <li> I love it this is a great price for 10 bottles !</li>
    <li> Before I could even use one bottle the other ones all dried out</li>
    <li> Glue was dryer up in all ten.</li>
    <li> Super strong glue, be careful to not glue your fingers together!</li>
