      <li>I just ordered the tutti frutti and the top coat</li>
      <li>But I figure I can always bring the polish and top coat with me to a salon and just have them use it.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>once an edge lifts you better just forget it - its coming off.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even do another top coat at week one, as recommended.  </li>

      <li>Love it as does my daughter.</li>
      <li>Really works!!!!  </li>
      <li>Ok, so although this polish doesn&#x27;t look perfect for a whole week, it&#x27;s a heck of a lot better than normal nail polish.</li>
      <li>Tuttu Frutti is a great bright pink with a purple/blue reflection.</li>
      <li>This polish is a great product so far.</li>
      <li>:) I used it with no base coat, and the CND Topcoat.</li>
      <li>Easily removed with acetone.</li>
      <li>Very cute and summery color that is very girly and fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Super!</li>
      <li>It adds that great shine that you only get from gel polish!</li>
      <li>I liked the polish so much I ended up purchasing two addional colors (Vexed Violette and Sugared Spice)</li>
      <li>I purchased this color -- a beautiful, irridescent pink that I have not worn in years -- and the CND topcoat.  </li>
      <li>although and like the rich brightness of this color.</li>
      <li>This is a fun color!  </li>
      <li>With this polish I&#x27;ve averaged 3-5 days without issues, then I use a fine grit file and gently roughen any chipped areas and spot-fix with polish before topping off with the VinyLux top coat.</li>
      <li>Great pink color for summer.  </li>
      <li>The shade was true to the photo</li>
      <li>I love it, and will definitely be buying more colors.</li>
      <li>I used the Vinylux system and have found that if I add a top coat after a couple of days that it does hold up better over the course of a week than traditional polish (I&#x27;m an OPI fan myself).</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>Dries super fast!!</li>
      <li>Great polish, pretty pink color..</li>
      <li>this polish stays on for a very long time, make sure you buy their top coat too.  </li>
      <li>I usually love Vinylux, but it seems like its starting to make my nails weaker and they crack easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had it on for 3 weeks right now without a single chip, Still looks almost as gorgeous as the day I had the pedi.</li>
      <li>NOTHING I have ever purchased stays on my nails for more than a day or two without chipping, nor does any professional manicure, except for gel or shellac manicures.  </li>
      <li>Two coats and a top coats gets you gorgeous nails for a week, at least.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite color of nail polish out of everything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>Has stayed nice for one week so definitely lives up to promise.</li>
      <li>Really covers extremely well with great color.</li>
      <li>I love the ease - quick dry, no base.</li>
      <li>I do dishes an regular house cleaning on daily basis with polish still looking great.</li>
      <li>Like that its somewhat metallic (looks exactly as pictured indescription)</li>
      <li>And to top all that off, it only lasts a day on me before chipping.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend and purchase more colors..;)</li>
      <li>Love it meets expectation color is great last longer than expected would recommend it to everybody price is reasonable so far</li>
      <li>It is really pretty for short-term wear, though.</li>
      <li>Longer lasting than most polishes</li>
      <li>Use this with the top coat and your pedicure will last 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>This is my second bottle of this color as I love it.  </li>
      <li>It does not last a week even with use of the top coat.  </li>
      <li>This is the first one I&#x27;ve got that stained.</li>
      <li>Also clumps up a bit, but definitely better then regular nail polish.</li>
      <li>It gets four stars because the color is so pretty on.  </li>
      <li>Great polish and very long lasting!!!</li>
      <li>If anyone knows of a great shade of light/baby pink that isn&#x27;t too sheer let me know!&lt;br</li>
      <li>The top coat also helps it to dry really fast saving me lots of time!</li>

    <li> It gets four stars because the color is so pretty on.  And it only gets four stars because it peels faster than it claims, although not any faster than any other polish.  I use an OPI base coat and have tried using both Seche Vite and another high-end top coat with it, and it doesn&#x27;t make any difference.  It is really pretty for short-term wear, though.</li>
    <li> A fun pink pink pink color with shimmer! Hot Pink is a color to be seen!!  Love it as does my daughter. This polish is a great product so far. NO CHIPPING!! Dries super fast!!</li>
    <li> Love this color,period!</li>
    <li> I used the Vinylux system and have found that if I add a top coat after a couple of days that it does hold up better over the course of a week than traditional polish (I&#x27;m an OPI fan myself). In the main, they hold up well. However, I finally took Tutti Frutti off on day 9 (still looking fabulous but for some minor chips and edge wear) and my nails look kinda...peachy. They were a little yellowed from traditional polish before. Now they&#x27;re bad enough that even my husband noticed and my kids wouldn&#x27;t shut up about it. I do recommend trying Vinylux. I have worn Purple Purple (a really dark blurple color) with no trouble. This is the first one I&#x27;ve got that stained.</li>
    <li> everyone loved the color............</li>
    <li> Non returnable even if not used</li>
    <li> Awesome color. It is very pink, I felt like Barbie, but it is so fun!</li>
    <li> The color of this polish is just beautiful. I have had strangers stop me to compliment my pedicure, which has never happened before. I had a spa pedicure at a high-end hotel and chose this polish because of the color alone, having no idea about the quality. The woman who did my pedicure told me that it&#x27;s supposed to be the next big thing in polishes, that women have been raving about it because of how long it lasts without chipping. I&#x27;ve had it on for 3 weeks right now without a single chip, Still looks almost as gorgeous as the day I had the pedi. I just ordered the tutti frutti and the top coat so I can try to recreate it myself once I have to redo it, so I can&#x27;t say how the results will be doing it at home. But I figure I can always bring the polish and top coat with me to a salon and just have them use it. Really happy with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Vinylux is awesome! I&#x27;m actually getting two weeks on a manicure. See my review of Vinylux Sugared Spice for more details.</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t like these products. It chipped exactly the same as regular polish-even used the top coat that goes with it. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> Great polish and very long lasting!!!</li>
    <li> When I had nails done with this brand it stayed on great, but my results with this color/bottle were about what I experience with others. Was a little disappointed.Wonder if there is a secret to application.</li>
    <li> I love Vinylux. It truly holds for a full week!!!!!  I used to polish my nails one day and they would be chippped the next.  Well no more with Vinylux!!!</li>
    <li> Great color for summer. I love the ease - quick dry, no base. Use this with the top coat and your pedicure will last 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Love it meets expectation color is great last longer than expected would recommend it to everybody price is reasonable so far</li>
    <li> I usually love Vinylux, but it seems like its starting to make my nails weaker and they crack easily. This particular color left stains on my nails when I removed it!</li>
    <li> This nail polish does not chip at all! I love it. I did find on vacation, however, that if you are going to be in the water a lot, the entire shell of the polish will peel off. For intermittent water submersion or daily use, it is awesome.</li>
    <li> This color looks nice after two coats. Not chunky or funky looking. Of course like all the vinylux after a few days the shine goes away.</li>
    <li> This is the best polish I have found.  It stays on for at least a week without chips.  Love the color tool.</li>
    <li> This is a fun color!  It&#x27;s a pink with purple undertones.  Very similar to OPI&#x27;s Pompei Purple color.  I absolutely LOVE the Vinylux products!</li>
    <li> Nail polish does chip and peels off horribly.  It does not last a week even with use of the top coat.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Although this product says a base coat is not necessary - IT IS!! My nails were ORANGE for weeks after I removed the polish! Other wise it lasts the week without chipping if you do this: apply base coat, 2 coats of polish, apply Seche Vite topcoat - beautiful !</li>
    <li> Love this brand! Beautiful colors &amp; polish lasts longer than most &amp; makes nails very strong! Great price &amp; fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I bought the CND scrubfresh cleaner, two polishes, and the topcoat.  I am on my second manicure and it is the best I have ever used.  I am on day 10 and my nails still look great, even though I spend the better part of my day in the kitchen.  I didn&#x27;t even do another top coat at week one, as recommended.  You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought this!  I have used just about every brand of nail polish over the years and I&#x27;ve never had one last this long, even if I get them done professionally.  And another great point, each coat dries in about 10 minutes, with no base coat required.</li>
    <li> Finally, a nail polish that last a week or longer and doesn&#x27;t require an ultra-violet light.  Removes quickly with regular nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> I bought a few of the Vinylux nail polishes and top coat after a friend of mine raved about them on Facebook.  Let me tell you, not a fan.  I don&#x27;t know if the polishes I got were old, or what, but they go on kind of thick and goopy, no matter how thin you try to get it, and I am used to doing thin, I also do gel nails on myself.  And then when you put the topcoat on, it looks even goopier and bubbly.  And to top all that off, it only lasts a day on me before chipping.  So sorry I wasted all that money!</li>
    <li> Great color,price &amp; product.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and a great product.</li>
    <li> already owned just reordering</li>
    <li> works! LASTS!&lt;br /&gt;What more could you ask for!?</li>
    <li> This is the best polish I ever got. It looks amazing. I have gotten so many complements. I wear it almost all the time.</li>
    <li> Great color for summer!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what this stuff is made of but it&#x27;s amazing! It really stays on at least a week with no chipping and the colors are gorgeous! I can&#x27;t stop buying them. This color is beautiful and fun. Lots of compliments from people and all of my friends are buying the Vinylux products now. We love them and have a blast comparing colors we have purchased. I won&#x27;t be buying another polish brand, EVER!!! Two coats and a top coats gets you gorgeous nails for a week, at least. You will need to trim your nails before this wears off. Easily removed with acetone. This color is a beautiful magenta! It won&#x27;t disappoint!!!!</li>
    <li> Longer lasting than most polishes but  it needed a little touch up after about 5 days. Very pretty deep pink color.</li>
    <li> This is Very blue-pink-good for winter or fall people-gave it to my brunette friend&lt;br /&gt;she loves it. Very Blue-Pink and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Stays for about 2 days if you wash hands often. Also clumps up a bit, but definitely better then regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this color as I love it.  Like that its somewhat metallic (looks exactly as pictured indescription) although and like the rich brightness of this color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product. As an earlier review mentioned, the color is very similar to OPI&#x27;s Pompeii Purple - but I found it to be a little more pink as compared to the violet in the OPI color. Very cute and summery color that is very girly and fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the longevity of the polish, I&#x27;ll start by saying that I am a destroyer of nail polish. Including shellac, gel, standard, and acrylic nails. Typically if I paint my nails myself (if I manage to keep them acceptable through the drying process) they will chip within 24 hours. Gel nails, once an edge lifts you better just forget it - its coming off. With this polish I&#x27;ve averaged 3-5 days without issues, then I use a fine grit file and gently roughen any chipped areas and spot-fix with polish before topping off with the VinyLux top coat. It dries decently quickly and it makes my thin nails more durable. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing additional colors. If anyone knows of a great shade of light/baby pink that isn&#x27;t too sheer let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, make sure you get the top coat!! It adds that great shine that you only get from gel polish!</li>
    <li> NOTHING I have ever purchased stays on my nails for more than a day or two without chipping, nor does any professional manicure, except for gel or shellac manicures.  I wanted the ease and cost efficiency of a gel or shellac manicure at home (and to avoid the LED lights, which I have read some negative information about recently).  I purchased this color -- a beautiful, irridescent pink that I have not worn in years -- and the CND topcoat.  The polish and topcoat were easy to apply, dried within 10 minutes and lasted a full week.  I liked the polish so much I ended up purchasing two addional colors (Vexed Violette and Sugared Spice) and I intend to purchase additional colors.</li>
    <li> I love Vinylux Polish.  It lasts for two weeks without chipping and saves me money as I only get a professional manicure every 2 weeks now.  It dries so fast, so within no time it&#x27;s dry and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
    <li> lasts much longer than regular nail polish</li>
    <li> Looks pink has a blue cast so not too cute.</li>
    <li> This polish stays on 7-10 days! It is awesome. Never chips and beautiful finish. It applies and removes just like regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> Really covers extremely well with great color. Has stayed nice for one week so definitely lives up to promise. I do dishes an regular house cleaning on daily basis with polish still looking great.</li>
    <li> Ok, so although this polish doesn&#x27;t look perfect for a whole week, it&#x27;s a heck of a lot better than normal nail polish. I love it, and will definitely be buying more colors. Tuttu Frutti is a great bright pink with a purple/blue reflection. Perfect for spring and summer. :) I used it with no base coat, and the CND Topcoat.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of polish! I love the colors and the fact that it lasts a long time without chipping! The top coat also helps it to dry really fast saving me lots of time!</li>
    <li> This product works SO well. As long as you use the Scrub Fresh and the top coat, per the directions, this polish will last at least a week with NO chipping!</li>
    <li> Super! I love it! The same as on a picture</li>
    <li> Really works!!!!  Love it</li>
    <li> this polish stays on for a very long time, make sure you buy their top coat too.  I get lots of compliments on this color.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite color of nail polish out of everything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Great pink color for summer.  Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Love the color but it doesn&#x27;t last any longer than my OPI even with the base and top coats,</li>
    <li> Bold color with a little iridescence--will use when I am going to beach or something special.  Wears just like other Vinylux colors.</li>
    <li> The shade was true to the photo and it lasts just as long as the Vinylux does when applied in the salon. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great polish, pretty pink color..Color also lasts very long at least 2 weeks with no chipping..&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend and purchase more colors..;)</li>
    <li> beautiful color. goes on nice.</li>
