<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best lotion we ever used.</li>
    <li> I have tried all lotions and decided to give a try . This is not greasy and absorbs just great and no film or smell. Always passed this over when a health professional and wish i never did.</li>
    <li> some of the best I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Just as expected. Great product for sensitive skin babies.</li>
    <li> I know there are many positive reviews for this moisturizer, but my own experience with it left something to be desired. I have combination skin with occasional dry patches, and I like to apply moisturizer at night after cleansing my face.     The Cetaphil lotion has a nice consistency to it- thin and easy to spread over your skin. However, I felt that it took a very long time to absorb, even when my face was freshly washed. My skin still felt slightly sticky several hours later. For that reason, I gave it two stars.     I think that for people with very dry skin, this could be a great product, but for those of us with only occasional dryness, it is too strong. It works great as an unscented body lotion, though.</li>
    <li> Good buy and good lotion.</li>
    <li> We use it all over every day and it works great!</li>
    <li> I prefer Burts over this lotion. With this lotion I always feel that I have a layer of lotion on my skin. Doesn&#x27;t seem to observe as well as Burts does.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great,  Outdoors alot and dry rough hands and feet.  Keeps them both soft.</li>
    <li> best lotion i ever had and the family uses it also. will use cetaphyl forever. love the moisterizing face lotion also--excelent</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife&#x27;s dry hands and I use it occasionally myself!  Good product!</li>
    <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO Y A UN MUY BUEN PRECIO, EXCELENTE CALIDAD Y RAPIDO, RECOMENDACION PARA TODOS LOS COMPRADORES EN COMPRAR ESTE PRODUCTO</li>
    <li> this is great lotion...price is good!</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and for years have been trying to find a lotion mainly for my face because every facial lotion I have tried just doesn&#x27;t work and/or gives me redness or a rash. So I decided to try this on my face as a moisturizer and it&#x27;s perfect. No redness, no rashes, just nice soft skin. A little bit goes a long way and I just put on a little but after I get out of the shower! This lotion is great for your skin and makes your skin feel healthy and soft!</li>
    <li> this is my second time order.  i found it&#x27;s good to my skin, especially during winter time in East Coast.</li>
    <li> My wife  bought this pack from Sam&#x27;s club, for a few dollars less. It was great at first:  smooth &amp; zero smell.   Then she left the lotion on her  eczema hand overnight.   She woke up with her eczema worsened.  It might be from the alcohol and macadamia nut oil.   Her cracked &amp; bleeding hand-rash fared better with non-alcohol base like Aquaphor.   Nut-based lotion like Argan oil also worsened her eczema.</li>
    <li> Good lotion not to heavy dries up with no greasy residue I would recommend this lotion because it is good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion for years.  People always compliment me on the condition of my facial skin and I know it&#x27;s because of Cetaphil.  This product was recommended to me by a dermatologist.  I can actually say that I have less wrinkles today than I had ten years ago.  Also, this product totally removed the tough, callused skin on my heels.  Try this product; you&#x27;ll definitely see a difference in your skin.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I ever had.</li>
    <li> Sometimes leaves a slight smell, maybe of the lotion itself, but it was drying out my hands when I used it daily. I might try to again to see if I have a similar reaction, but most of my skin isn&#x27;t dry.</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion. I was having trouble with really dry skin on my legs. Have been using the lotion every day and my skin is back to normal. Also been applying to my hips and noticed the stretch marks less noticeable.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion, especially for folks with sensitive skin.  It works remarkably well for my babies and it is the only moisturizer that is recommended by their pediatrician.</li>
    <li> I have used Cetaphil for over10 years.  My dermatologist recommended it when I was going through perimenopause and I broke out in rosacea. I use the cleanser, and the moisturizing cream and lotion. It&#x27;s awesome. It works! Here&#x27;s a tip. Since it has no scent, I mix my favorite essential oils in with it! A moisturizer that works , AND smells exactly how I want it to!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil for years and I no longer have a problem with a red nose. The doctor told me I had roseasa and recommended that I take a prescription medicine for it. Since I only have problems sporadically, I didn&#x27;t want to take anything medicinal. The doctor never told me about Cetaphil-- I read about it in a pamphlet in the waiting room. It&#x27;s wonderful- I use it morning and night, under makeup and as a night lotion. The price is right, too. A bottle will last and last because you only need a small amount.</li>
    <li> This is a very thick lotion.  If you have very dry skin this is the stuff for you.  The first time you apply it you will notice it is significantly thicker than the other lotions that lose power in a couple hours.  This stuff stays.  It however does not make your skin oily.  The thick consistency takes some time to get used to, but eventually feels better than more watered down lotions.  I actually apply this directly to my face every morning with no issue.  It does not cause acne.    I use it with this every day for clear skin:    [...]    If you are serious about skincare then these two products are needed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for years. A great moisturizer with no scent to compete with your favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used for lubricating my Bach 42A trombone slide.  This and a little bit of silicone make the slide move like lightning.  I very rarely need to add extra water. Cleans off easily with soap and water.</li>
    <li> I love to used Cetaphil updated lotion it work better weith the extra things its made of.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did not have any at the time, so I ordered the regular cetaphil lotion which still my Skin  a cool feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Neil</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best ever used, not only for dry skin, but also for occassional itchy bumps which my husband gets quite frequently after suffering from Shingles.  After just a day or two of using Cetaphil, the itchy bumps are gone.  I would highly recommend this product.  I always stock up when it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
    <li> SUPER MOISTURIZES MY SKILL EVERYDAY.</li>
    <li> I have severe dry skin and this seems to help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too sure this product is any better than any other moisturizer out there, but that least it&#x27;s made for sensitive skin. It just seems very fluid like the kind of lotion you get at a dollar store, kinda cheap in quality.</li>
    <li> Pool chemicals totally messed up my skin and I went through a long period suffering with a horrible bout of eczema. The best advice I found was to moisturize immediately following a shower, and I did. But the thing is, only one product brought me complete relief -- and I tried many -- Cetaphil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff might not be the cheapest you&#x27;ll find, but to me, it&#x27;s the best. I&#x27;m lifetime loyal.</li>
    <li> I love Cetaphil, no sent, just moisturizing</li>
    <li> Came on time and sealed. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Looks good for the price, regularly I use it and get from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion 20 oz 2 pack ...&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very good lotion, I really like the small size for travel, etc.  My favorite Lotion ever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for my boys dry skin. they&#x27;ve using for about 2 weeks and we can already feel how better their skin is.</li>
    <li> Very good for the skin of my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> A great buy on a great product.</li>
    <li> My Grandmother used to use this lotion religiously. I just started a few months ago and I love this lotion!  It&#x27;s light and it keeps my skin moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would have done if the doctor had not recommended Cetaphil moisturising lotion for my then-baby boy with eczema. I regularly apply it all over his bodywwithin two minutes of the shower and both he and I enjoy his soft, scratch less skin. He is six years old now. I hardly use steroids on his skin. A must have for everyone with eczema.</li>
    <li> Fragrance free and thin and delicate lotion that really works. I use it on my hands, feet, lips and eyes... no more need for Chapstick or any other skin care product, and doesn&#x27;t contain fragrance or anything I am allergic to. It&#x27;s one of the only products I have found that is fragrance free and works. Well worth the expensive price, as the bottle lasts a long time. You don&#x27;t need much at one time! Everyone I know wants to know &amp;#34;where did I get this.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s available at many drug stores and here on Amazon. The only thing I wish is that they would come out with one that had Aloe in it. I&#x27;m going to try mixing aloe from my plant in with the lotion when I put it on my hands at night. Love it!</li>
    <li> The two pack for this lotion is a deal. Use it to help my seborrheic dermatitis that is particularly bad this time of year.</li>
    <li> A little too &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Cetaphil - both the facial wash and the lotion. I use this on my face every night and under my eyes before I put on make-up. It&#x27;s like magic in a bottle.</li>
    <li> Good price and fast shipping on a great lotion. I have very dry, scaly skin and this product really helps. Would recommend this over the cream as easier to apply.</li>
    <li> I order this package every two months and I&#x27;m pleased. I have ezcema and super dry skin so cetaphil is the only lotion that works well for me</li>
    <li> My wife uses this moisurizer for her daily regimen of skin care.  Consequently, we purchase the 2-pack, 20 fl. oz. for her skin moisterizing needs.  She&#x27;s used Cetaphil for her skin cares needs for several years now and she intends to continue with this product.</li>
    <li> It is a moisturizing  agent that seem to do the job.</li>
    <li> Great product, not greasy and has no smell.</li>
    <li> just got this the other day to use on face and&lt;br /&gt;neck, great, dont need 5 different products&lt;br /&gt;that do what this stuff does in one&lt;br /&gt;its alot easier just to rub this on the face and&lt;br /&gt;neck and be done, my face was so dry I could&lt;br /&gt;not stand it, but the next morning I woke up and&lt;br /&gt;what a difference! better then paying for high price&lt;br /&gt;lotions,</li>
    <li> She loves this product.</li>
    <li> I love Cetaphil products. My dermatologist told me to use it to calm down my skin when is irritated and it really works.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the only lotion that works for my sever dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It moisterizes without leaving my face greasy. I recently discovered that my dermatologist also recommends this lotion. I have had a lot of problems with chemicals and fragrances in products  in the past, such as rashes or itching, so was especially relieved to find that this one gives me no problems of that sort at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisture to heal dry, inflamed skin. I use mostly for body post-shower, but this is great on lips and under eyes before bedtime too. Costco has cheaper prices for larger bottles though.</li>
    <li> The best body lotion unescent!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever.  I have allergies and this gives me NO  problems!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered the lotion, but received the cleanser. Got the refund from Amazon right away and be allowed to keep the wrong item. I used the cleanser for my 2 month boy, turned out the product work very well. The cleanser is soft n mild, no soap, no fragrant which is perfect for my boy who has very dry n sensivetive skin. No need to use JnJ anymore, and my husband n I use it to clean our face too. Love it! I ended up to buy  the lotion at Costco for my baby.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great product! Though costly, it&#x27;s worth every penny. My skin rejoices!</li>
    <li> Cetaphil is a great lotion, and one of the few that truly moisturizes for long periods of time. I love that it is TRULY UNSCENTED. Yay!!</li>
    <li> guys, this is a god given moisturizer. It is just not for people with dry skin, but also combination and oily. it makes your skin baby soft for real!!</li>
    <li> My most favorite moisturizing lotion.</li>
    <li> Extremely good lotion for dry skin. This is a real value pack. The bottles are larger and cheaper than the store.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, very fine skin which can rip and weep very easily.  Cetaphil has been the only product which has helped keep my skin in tact and feeling soft.  I highly recommend it for everyone but especially for those with problem skin!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. I have been using this on my 6 year old since he was born and continuing the tradition with my new born.</li>
    <li> This is a product my dermatologist recommended and I&#x27;ve used it for some time now without any rash or itching which I have issues with other products.</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by my rhuemotologist for dry skin and itchiness.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this unscented, non-greasy lotion (endorsed by dermatologists/cosmetic surgeons) on my face, hands, and torso and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I especially like the pump. Lotion is easily absorbed. It is smooth, silky, and fragrance free. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> this cream my doctor recommended me, I use it for myself, my 3 year old daughter and my 9 month old, it is great and they have very sanitary skin and soft, I recommend it to all family!!</li>
    <li> I live in the desert and have had dry skin most of my life plus, I am 70 years old. I have tried every kind of heavy duty cream plus taking fish oil, I mean everything and nothing worked for more than a few hours and then I had to reapply. Recently I had a facial peel done and you have to keep your skin hydrated. A dermatologist had given me a sample of the Cetaphil skin wash and I liked the product so I decided to look at the reviews and check out the moisturizing lotion. One person said they used it on their face and body so I tried it. This will be the only cream I will use for the rest of my life!!!!!!!!! What an amazing product! Even if I use it every other day, my skin stays moist and very soft. I buy the jar and it&#x27;s a cream, not a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;If this works on me it will work on anybody. I&#x27;m still in shock and I&#x27;m telling everybody.</li>
    <li> this package brings great value compared to the usual 16 oz units</li>
    <li> I just received this lotion. I have eczema and this is the only lotion that works great in the winter AND summer!</li>
    <li> A dry, itchy back and legs are no fun.  My dermatologist told me to use Cetaphil and it really does the job - no more itching!!!</li>
    <li> I like that it is gentle but it probably does not remove make up well since it also does not remove well like oil on the T-zone of the face in a combination oily and dry face. I still have to do a quick follow up with soap if I want to remove the greasy feeling on some parts of my face. So it is not that good for an oily or combination oily face..</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion for children with eczema.</li>
    <li> my husband has very dry skin and the Dr. recommended this product.  it seems to help  it doesn&#x27;t clear it up but helps the itch.</li>
    <li> been using cetaphil moisturiser for my baby from the day she was 1 month old, just shifted to Burts bee as it is specific for baby and kids</li>
    <li> Excelent product and seller!</li>
    <li> Great seller, love this item</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizing lotion I use.  I have very dry skin and this is helps.  I put it on in the morning and at night before bed.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil makes a product my sister-in-law loves:  It rehydrates her skin and softens too.  Perfect for dry skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil for years for basic moisturizing needs.  No fragrance or colors added, and no irritation on my skin.</li>
    <li> Because of very dry skin, I add some urea, Shea butter, coconut oil and cocoa butter to this hand lotion to improve its lasting effects. An ounce of urea, 2 tsp of each of the oils works well and dissolves into the Cetaphil easily.</li>
    <li> My mom is going through chemo therapy and her skin is very dry... this is the recommended lotion by her doctor.</li>
    <li> I had a great experience with the product, value and deliver. The option to bought a twin pack was a differencial. I´m Realy satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great product, great seller, HIGH QUALITY... HIGHLY Recommended. VERY SATISFIED</li>
    <li> A super size... 4oz larger than in the stores&lt;br /&gt;at a super price... AND the product does no harm&lt;br /&gt;to sensitive skin</li>
    <li> This is a great product that really works.  It&#x27;s very hard to find in the 20 oz package.  I suspect that Cetaphil no longer packages it that way, which is unfortunate.</li>
    <li> This is the lotion that everyone in our family uses.  It moisturizes wonderfully without any hint of a fragrance.  It is great for ALL skin types....which our family has.  It also works great for people like me that have skin allergies to certain products.</li>
    <li> Came with a broken pump...</li>
    <li> Been using it on and off for the last couple weeks, it works for my eczema as long as I put it on everyday, if I don&#x27;t after a couple days it will come back. Overall I think this lotion is great</li>
    <li> Excellent product, delivered on time, very useful for my kids sensitive skin.  Definitely I will buy again from this seller, Thanks.</li>
    <li> The Cetaphil lotion is one of the best lotions for babies. My grandson uses no less than this gentle lotion for babies as well as adults like me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great buy, hope to buy the cream in the Jar later. With the two packs, I won&#x27;t be needing any more for the rest of the year.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing your skin well !</li>
    <li> What can I say about this lotion other than it&#x27;s about the best lotion out there.  Sure it&#x27;s on the pricy side, but you get what you pay for with this product.  I initially began using this lotion because it was prescribed by a dermatologist.  I have a sensitive skin condition and have used all sorts of lotions in the past, but nothing beats this product other than something much pricier and requires a prescription from a doctor.  This product moisturizes better than any other lotion available without a prescription.  Hands down.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> best lotion i have ever used</li>
    <li> Excellent product, everybody should try! Tks for come on time! This is dermatologic recomended, my skin is another skin after use this moisturising!</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive skin. This lotion is great because it soaks into your skin quickly so your clothes don&#x27;t get covered. It is not greasy, so you don&#x27;t feel like you have a layer of grease on top of your skin. Also, the moisture is long lasting so you don&#x27;t have to keep putting it on.</li>
    <li> Great everyday lotion. No fragrance</li>
    <li> For years I looked for a good body lotion for my dry sensitive skin.  This product is what I was waiting for.  Even in the driest winter months, it moisturizes well without causing any irritation or allergic reaction and it lasts all day. I no longer wake up scratching my arms and legs due to dry skin.  I have used it for several years now and don&#x27;t think I will ever stop.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about the Cetaphil; it always does a great job of moisturizing!!</li>
    <li> So my sister messaged me the other week telling me about her friend that had used this lotion to combat his psoriasis. I always try these crazy recommendations in hope that it would do SOMETHING. After using this product on my psoriasis for the past week I am 90% cleared! I have had psoriasis for twelve years now (im 27 currently). I have tried everything from topical prescriptions to an in-home stand up UVB machine (which does help but at the risk of skin cancer!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my experience and knowledge of going to the doctor, I recommend that people stop using their steroid topical treatments as they will increase your psoriasis in the long-run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting sun is obviously great at reducing it. The UVB works to slow down the t-cell production of skin cells(which is basically why we get the red/white patches on our body, Overlapping skin cells as our skin grows 7x the rate of a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; person. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I do. I use this product on all my spots and put it on as much as I can. (2-4 times  day). I believe the most important would be to do it right when you wake up and right before bed. Buying two bottles I keep on in my office and the other on my bed stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is working to clear it up faster than steroid topicals. This stuff really works, and for the price I mean who wouldn&#x27;t KEEP using this. It is a lot safer than any steroids or UVB treatments. I also have a panosol II in my home which I try not to use as much now due to the risk of skin cancer so that should tell you how bad I have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone that has psoriasis should buy this and give it a try! I have severe psoriasis and not just some patches here and there. I have it on my legs, chest, arms, head and it typically covers 25%-50% of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a great product, Five stars!</li>
    <li> Nothing in the market that is as effective as this.....and with no chemicals! I have very dry skin and nothing worked until I found this magic!</li>
    <li> Creamy, does the job.  Non-oily or staining.</li>
    <li> Love Cetaphil moisterizing lotion.  Great product.  . Received it very quickly. Good price, actually bargain price.&lt;br /&gt;Used after bathing makes the skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> I love all Cethaphil&#x27;s product because are recommend by dermatologist and don&#x27;t have fragance. I have very dry skin and also live in a cold zone so it&#x27;s perfecto for me because it&#x27;s humectant all the time. Now I have a baby girl and used with her and it&#x27;s great. Also use the soap because your skin it&#x27;s delicate.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is now better with this products. 100% recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil for years to restore my skin after swimming practice. It&#x27;s odorless and goes on without leaving much of a film on the skin. This double-pack from Amazon is a great value compared with the local drug store.</li>
