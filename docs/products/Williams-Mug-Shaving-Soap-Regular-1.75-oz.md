      <li>It is possible to get a good lather from this soap.  </li>
      <li>True value for the price.</li>
      <li>This is the second shaving soap I have tried, and am very satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>I switched back to the old school shaving brush and soap for two reasons; it seems more environmentally friendly and hot lather in the morning feels really good.  </li>
      <li>If you let the soap soak in water with your brush for a few minutes there is no issue generating a really great lather.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>Bought the set of three, well worth the money, better than the junk in the can, and nothing like a good wet shave the old fashioned way, hope these guys never move to China, it&#x27;ll break my heart.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent shaving soap-- long lasting and reasonably priced</li>
      <li>Fits in most regular sized shaving mugs.</li>

      <li>and I&#x27;m still using the first one.  </li>
      <li>I will not continue to use it if I continue to have this much trouble getting a good lather.</li>
      <li>Lather very well.  </li>
      <li>Williams lathers up well and it doesn&#x27;t smell like you put on too much aftershave.</li>
      <li>the modern shaving creams and gels smell like.</li>
      <li>I use this with a safety razor but you can use it with straight razors too.</li>
      <li>I guess you could also use it with a modern multi-blade cartridge razor if you wanna shave like someone who spends $30 a month to get razor burn.</li>
      <li>would recommend this to anyone in search of respectable soap for a wet shave.</li>
      <li>Lasts much longer than shave cream in aerosol can, and container is biodegradable.</li>
      <li>One you will really appreciate, day after day.</li>
      <li>Lathers up pretty quick and doesn&#x27;t dry out, unless you shave at a snails pace.</li>
      <li>Pure old school, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
      <li>I ordered the 3 pack, and I&#x27;ve been using the first shaving soap for 4 months and looks barely used.</li>
      <li>but I jump on any chance to try a new product.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly suprised with Williams Shaving Soap; the lather was thick, and indeed, lasted very long.</li>
      <li>Smells like an old barber shop and not like chemicals or mint or</li>
      <li>Nothing beats the value this product offers.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;s really smooth and slick.</li>
      <li>It dried quickly, it clumped on my razor, and it made a brand new blade feel like it had been used five or six times, it took so long to shave.</li>
      <li>Gives a really nice thick lather and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like a lot of other soaps I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>The problem is lather that is too airy and thin and that dissipates very quickly.  </li>

    <li> Williams makes the best shaving soap.  I switched back to the old school shaving brush and soap for two reasons; it seems more environmentally friendly and hot lather in the morning feels really good.  Williams lathers up well and it doesn&#x27;t smell like you put on too much aftershave.</li>
    <li> Product received as described &amp; on time</li>
    <li> My husband uses it every day.</li>
    <li> No nonsense shaving soap. Fits in most regular sized shaving mugs. Best used with a shave brush, preferably badger hair but I was able to hand lather it reasonably well out of boredom. Lathers up pretty quick and doesn&#x27;t dry out, unless you shave at a snails pace. Smells like an old barber shop and not like chemicals or mint or w/e the modern shaving creams and gels smell like. And not like flowers and fruit which is what the expensive hard soaps smell like. Don&#x27;t use this soap if you&#x27;re afraid to smell like a man. I use this with a safety razor but you can use it with straight razors too. I guess you could also use it with a modern multi-blade cartridge razor if you wanna shave like someone who spends $30 a month to get razor burn.</li>
    <li> Everything went as it should have.</li>
    <li> Fantastic shave soap. Gives a really nice thick lather and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like a lot of other soaps I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Great value, no surprises. This is your basic shave soap and will get the job done without any nuanced fragrances or herbal crap on your face.</li>
    <li> Lather very well.  A soapy smell</li>
    <li> This is a really good shaving soap. No frills, scents or gimmicks. Pure old school, it&#x27;s the real deal. It loads up easily on your brush and builds up a good, creamy lather on your face. I&#x27;s really smooth and slick. If you brush up the right amount of soap and warm water you will receive a wonderful shave. One you will really appreciate, day after day.</li>
    <li> been using Williams for years ,what can I say? it&#x27;s good, lots of lather and it lasts.will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Just like I used when I was a kid! Love this stuff and the seller got it to me fast</li>
    <li> Good lather and help give me a clean shave. By buying the 3 pack I not only saved money but have it on hand.</li>
    <li> Repeat customer. Had to get these when my local retailer sold out and did not restock. My husband is a life time shaving cup user and this made his day. The price was great, delivery was fast and you can&#x27;t get a lather like this from any can. My husband just lets me know when he puts in the last soap cake and I order some more. True value for the price.</li>
    <li> Good shaving soap. Lathers well and give a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This is the second shaving soap I have tried, and am very satisfied with it. If you let the soap soak in water with your brush for a few minutes there is no issue generating a really great lather.</li>
    <li> This little cake of soap produces much lather, and lasts a long, long time. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I used this after only experiencing expensive shaving products. Builds a great, thick lather with a mild but pleasant aroma.  It softens the hair and causes less irritation than much more expensive products. I ordered the 3 pack, and I&#x27;ve been using the first shaving soap for 4 months and looks barely used.</li>
    <li> This soap is good for shaving and price is reasonable</li>
    <li> good lather, great shave</li>
    <li> It is possible to get a good lather from this soap.  I manage to do so about one out of every four tries.  It&#x27;s fussy.  I watched some YouTube videos on how to lather with this soap, and if I had not done so I would have dismissed it as totally unsatisfactory.  The problem is lather that is too airy and thin and that dissipates very quickly.  By soaking the puck in very hot water before using it and working the lather up thoroughly (takes WAY too long, I think) you can get a thick, slick lather.  I get the best results by adding a few drops of vegetable glycerin to the brush while I work the lather.  Otherwise I like the soap.  It has a nice, clean scent and is modestly priced.  I bought 3 pucks and I&#x27;m still using the first one.  If I&#x27;m able to consistently get the kind of lather I want by the time I use up this batch, I would definitely buy more.  I will not continue to use it if I continue to have this much trouble getting a good lather.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaving soap-- long lasting and reasonably priced</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Willams shaving soap for years.  Nothing beats the value this product offers.  The soap blocks last 3 months.  It provides a nice lather and will save you dozens of dollars over canned shaving creams and no cans to throw away.  Get yourself a shaving brush and buy this product.  You be greener and save big money compared to buying $2-3 dollar cans every month.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap, makes great suds for a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift.  Have not given it yet.  Don&#x27;t know if he likes it or not.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how to use this soap. Others think its great and I know there is a technique to get a goodnlather but I have been able to achive what I thought was a good lather only once and it was half way through a shave. It usually gives me a pretty weak lather.  It is super cheap and it it useable for me so I gabe 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Good old standby, started using this soap many, many years ago (they have been around for a long time), and it is still as good now as it was before! Bought the set of three, well worth the money, better than the junk in the can, and nothing like a good wet shave the old fashioned way, hope these guys never move to China, it&#x27;ll break my heart.</li>
    <li> Lasts much longer than shave cream in aerosol can, and container is biodegradable. An aerosol can is biodegradable too, in a thousand years.</li>
    <li> I have used Williams Mug Shaving soap for years. I use it primarily in the shower for shaving my scalp. I have recently started using the shaving soap for my face, as well. Using the soap on one&#x27;s face take some practice when going from use of an aerosol shaving cream. The shaving soap builds a lather, but not as thick as the aerosol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving soap once whipped to a lather and applied to the face makes for a most comfortable shave. I only have to apply the lather once. The lather last through the duration of my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the best results put some water on the soap and let sit for 30-seconds or so before whipping up the lather with a moistened shaving brush.</li>
    <li> Makes great lather, good price, but it!</li>
    <li> Great product. Basic soap and scent but the price is right and the service was great.</li>
    <li> Easily foams.  Good smell.  Close shave.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast service!  My husband has always (45 yrs) used a shaving mug and brush for shaving however over the last 10 years finding the shaving soap has become a challenge.  I was very happy to be able to locate it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Personally, I am a huge fan of Arko shave soap but I jump on any chance to try a new product. I was pleasantly suprised with Williams Shaving Soap; the lather was thick, and indeed, lasted very long. For me, however, Williams didnt have the clean refreshing sent that Arko has. Dont get me wrong the scent wasnt bad, rather a warmer, more old fashion scent. All-in-all, I cant deduct a single star from this product; it is exactly as described, it is a fantastic shaving soap, lathers well with minimal effort, perfect size and perfect packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone in search of respectable soap for a wet shave.</li>
    <li> great product at good price</li>
    <li> Creamier and smoother than the much more expensive shaving soap that I have been using. Smells better too.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as promised.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t think it gave me a closer shave but gave me a very comfortable shave, kind of smells like ivory soap</li>
    <li> This arrived promptly and is a great value. Shaving the old-fashioned way is a great way to start the day.</li>
    <li> great product. can&#x27;t find in stores. great price ,fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Just like the soap my dad had years ago</li>
    <li> The only other soap I&#x27;ve used is the one that came with my mug. This one lathers much better which makes for a smoother shave.</li>
    <li> Great smell and i like this better than gel or foam from a can.</li>
    <li> Horrible item. Will not use again. Worst shave soap I&#x27;ve ever used.. It dried quickly, it clumped on my razor, and it made a brand new blade feel like it had been used five or six times, it took so long to shave.</li>
