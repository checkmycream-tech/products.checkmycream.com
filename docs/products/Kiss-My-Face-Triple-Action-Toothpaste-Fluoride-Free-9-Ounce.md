      <li>This is the best toothpaste ever, and that is no exaggeration.</li>
      <li>lol  </li>
      <li>so to my joy found out that Amazon carried this brand.  </li>
      <li>Great taste and</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s great to save on the packaging and buy once.  </li>
      <li>The gel doesn&#x27;t leave a film or overpowering flavor in your mouth and the peppermint smells great.</li>
      <li>The toothpaste itself is great; I have no issues with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found this gel because it&#x27;s good for me and my teeth.</li>
      <li>Great taste and is refreshing!</li>
      <li>However, the $10 price was good for the size of the tube</li>
      <li>Good product that we continue to buy.</li>
      <li>Tastes good.</li>
      <li>Even better, they carried this humongous tube of it, and for a great deal.  </li>
      <li>I love the stuff!</li>
      <li>and it has a much more pleasant taste.</li>
      <li>Feels great and clean when finished.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Hope this helps someone :)</li>
      <li>Love the toothpaste but the packaging did not work out.  </li>
      <li>and I love the Kiss</li>
      <li>Love the gel toothpaste..</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and won&#x27;t buy anything else ever.</li>
      <li>Overall, very happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>I love using this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>The actual toothpaste is wonderful though!</li>
      <li>have tried many toothpastes, this is now my favorite.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Love the toothpaste but the huge tube is unmanageable.</li>
      <li>though..not as easy to handle.</li>
      <li>It taste cheap and leaves a film on your teeth.</li>
      <li>The tube is a full handful</li>
      <li>my mouth almost feeling like I just brushed &amp; used a good mouthwash.  </li>
      <li>My kids love this particular formula.</li>
      <li>:)  edit:  Ordered again; was very surprised to see this on my doorstep delivered Sunday as they said it would.    </li>
      <li>I was very happy at first to see that it came in a larger size because this is the only toothpaste my family</li>
      <li>but I decided to try the gel since this was a good price for such a large tube.  </li>
      <li>This triple action formula left my mouth feeling great.  </li>
      <li>My favorite natural toothpaste of all time.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth minty fresh</li>
      <li>The top seam completely split leaving my toothpaste to leak out whenever you try to use it.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth, but leaves it feeling clean and fresh unlike many other organic/natural pastes.</li>
      <li>Many &amp;#34;natural toothpastes&amp;#34; - with more natural ingredients leave my mouth feeling dry throughout the brushing.  </li>
      <li>Taste, cleanliness, and ingredients are exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve tried too many, and came back to this.</li>
      <li>This leaves your teeth feeling clean and breath fresh for so long!</li>
      <li>I think this makes my teeth feel much cleaner</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different toothpastes so far and this is by far the best ever.</li>
      <li>Good toothpaste but the tube is hard to handle even for my adult boyfriend.</li>
      <li>Its messy, and more like a hair gel cover.</li>
      <li>That I could live with</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a personal preference, but the gel tastes funny to me and doesn&#x27;t feel as &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; as the paste.  </li>
      <li>The actual toothpaste is fine -- pretty good taste -- but the tube it comes in is way too annoying for me to ever buy this again.  </li>
      <li>Not a big deal for a person in their 20s with large hands....</li>
      <li>2 tubes later: I&#x27;m in and out at the dentist for cleanings, so fast.</li>
      <li>* Natural Aloe Toothpaste with Xylitol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My Face Triple Action PASTE,</li>
      <li>My 9 year old needs help putting it on his toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>I purchased a few bottles of the stuff from the local store since I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get it there anymore.  </li>
      <li>They say my teeth are very clean and there&#x27;s hardly anything to scrape off.</li>
      <li>but I only use a quarter inch as it goes very far.   </li>
      <li>If you can avoid major brand toothpastes which contain sodium hydroxide (drain cleaner).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have a bigger reputation</li>
      <li>The tube is rather large though so this will last a very long time.</li>
      <li>Really freshens your breath, However, I have previously purchased this item for under $10.</li>

<li> * Natural Aloe Toothpaste with Xylitol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My Face Triple Action PASTE,</li>
<li> My 9 year old needs help putting it on his toothbrush.  </li>
<li> I purchased a few bottles of the stuff from the local store since I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get it there anymore.  </li>

<li> Really freshens your breath, However, I have previously purchased this item for under $10.</li>
<li> This new size will take a little getting used to -</li>
<li> Love the toothpaste, hate the large container.</li>
<li> No overpowering minty (ie artificial chemical) taste like most toothpastes.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t be swayed by other customer reviews about the size being too big, it&#x27;s really not a bother at all</li>
<li> Last time I went to get my teeth cleaned, they couldn&#x27;t even find anything to scrape accept a very little bit of calcium buildup at the bottom center teeth.  </li>
<li> I had no issues with the tube compare to the other users.</li>
<li> Love the toothpaste, hate the tube.  </li>
<li> and you&#x27;re adding less waste to the environment.</li>
<li> but this review is really about the large tube - it&#x27;s terrible.  </li>
<li> Only reason I gave it 4/5 is because the tube is difficult to squeeze and can cause the toothpaste to end up smeared on the inside of the cap.</li>
<li> but we have had no cavity issues while using this the past 9 months.</li>
<li> Too hard to squeeze out.</li>
<li> Like this toothpaste - though hard to squeeze out of the tube.</li>
<li> Because of its size, it is hard to squeeze it to get anything out.</li>
<li> and you have to squeeze hard to dispense it.</li>
<li> HATE the cover of the large tube.</li>
<li> For whatever reason (probably the thick plastic and the shape), it&#x27;s very hard to squeeze it out</li>
<li> The 9 oz size is slightly awkward (very wide)</li>
<li> This toothpaste is not effective!</li>
<li> and I use, however, very very hard to squeeze</li>
<li> The design makes it unnecessarily difficult to squeeze the toothpaste out.  </li>
<li> but maybe difficult for children or people with arthritis.</li>
<li> I took one star off because it is difficult to squeeze out of the tube.</li>
<li> Very poor design.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s awkward to get the toothpaste out.</li>

    <li> Great toothpaste!!!! Too hard to squeeze out.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is not effective! It taste cheap and leaves a film on your teeth. Do not buy this</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste ever, and that is no exaggeration. Taste, cleanliness, and ingredients are exactly what I was hoping for. Don&#x27;t be swayed by other customer reviews about the size being too big, it&#x27;s really not a bother at all and you&#x27;re adding less waste to the environment.</li>
    <li> Great taste and is refreshing!</li>
    <li> Many &amp;#34;natural toothpastes&amp;#34; - with more natural ingredients leave my mouth feeling dry throughout the brushing.  This triple action formula left my mouth feeling great.  The entire time of brushing, it was bubbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;* Antioxidant Defenders: Co-Q10 · Tea Tree Oil&lt;br /&gt;* Fluoride Free&lt;br /&gt;* Natural Aloe Toothpaste with Xylitol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left my mouth almost feeling like I just brushed &amp; used a good mouthwash.  And, that feeling lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Does NOT leave a film.  Feels great and clean when finished.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many toothpastes, this is now my favorite.  Hope this helps someone :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different toothpastes so far and this is by far the best ever. The gel doesn&#x27;t leave a film or overpowering flavor in your mouth and the peppermint smells great. I love this stuff and won&#x27;t buy anything else ever. I think they recommend you use an inch of it on your toothbrush but I only use a quarter inch as it goes very far.   UPDATE 2 tubes later: I&#x27;m in and out at the dentist for cleanings, so fast. They say my teeth are very clean and there&#x27;s hardly anything to scrape off. I&#x27;m so happy I found this gel because it&#x27;s good for me and my teeth. I&#x27;ll keep buying this over and over.</li>
    <li> Love the toothpaste but the huge tube is unmanageable.</li>
    <li> The tube is as big as a hair gel tube.  My 9 year old needs help putting it on his toothbrush.  The toothpaste itself is great; I have no issues with it.</li>
    <li> Love the toothpaste, hate the tube.  I was very happy at first to see that it came in a larger size because this is the only toothpaste my family and I use, however, very very hard to squeeze</li>
    <li> My favorite natural toothpaste of all time. Perfect texture and excellent flavor. Really freshens your breath, However, I have previously purchased this item for under $10. At the current price of almost $12, it is no longer competitive with the grocery store prices.</li>
    <li> Like the taste and big tube.</li>
    <li> I love using this toothpaste. And I like that it comes in a bigger size.</li>
    <li> Because of its size, it is hard to squeeze it to get anything out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for years; excellent toothpaste and Xylitol kills the plaque bacteria.  Last time I went to get my teeth cleaned, they couldn&#x27;t even find anything to scrape accept a very little bit of calcium buildup at the bottom center teeth.  I purchased a few bottles of the stuff from the local store since I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get it there anymore.  Finally, used up (well just about) so to my joy found out that Amazon carried this brand.  Even better, they carried this humongous tube of it, and for a great deal.  lol  Thanks Amazon.  :)  edit:  Ordered again; was very surprised to see this on my doorstep delivered Sunday as they said it would.    Didn&#x27;t even know anything shipped on Sunday.   :)</li>
    <li> Like this toothpaste - though hard to squeeze out of the tube.</li>
    <li> Great taste and it works! Both my kids and I have been using it and we have been getting rave reviews at the dentist.</li>
    <li> This new size will take a little getting used to - it&#x27;s like a big shampoo or lotion tube.  But it&#x27;s great to save on the packaging and buy once.  My kids love this particular formula.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have a bigger reputation/following...its the best tasting and working flouride-free and SLS-free toothpaste on the market...I love the stuff!</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste! No overpowering minty (ie artificial chemical) taste like most toothpastes. The 9 oz size is slightly awkward (very wide) though..not as easy to handle. The tube is a full handful and you have to squeeze hard to dispense it. Not a big deal for a person in their 20s with large hands....but maybe difficult for children or people with arthritis.</li>
    <li> This works well for us. Tastes good. It doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth minty fresh but we have had no cavity issues while using this the past 9 months. I took one star off because it is difficult to squeeze out of the tube. Good product that we continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Love the toothpaste but the packaging did not work out.  The top seam completely split leaving my toothpaste to leak out whenever you try to use it.  I like the idea of the bigger quantity but not if the packaging doesn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
    <li> If you can avoid major brand toothpastes which contain sodium hydroxide (drain cleaner). This is the best tooth paste I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth, but leaves it feeling clean and fresh unlike many other organic/natural pastes.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste but the tube is hard to handle even for my adult boyfriend. However, the $10 price was good for the size of the tube and I&#x27;d probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love the toothpaste, hate the large container. It&#x27;s awkward to get the toothpaste out.</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste/gel. We&#x27;ve tried too many, and came back to this. I even tried their paste version....no. This leaves your teeth feeling clean and breath fresh for so long! Yay!</li>
    <li> Not a fan.  The actual toothpaste is fine -- pretty good taste -- but the tube it comes in is way too annoying for me to ever buy this again.  The design makes it unnecessarily difficult to squeeze the toothpaste out.  I&#x27;m just trying to brush my teeth, not put in work!</li>
    <li> I had no issues with the tube compare to the other users.</li>
    <li> I prefer my toothpaste without fluoride and I love the Kiss My Face Triple Action PASTE, but I decided to try the gel since this was a good price for such a large tube.  Meh.  It&#x27;s a personal preference, but the gel tastes funny to me and doesn&#x27;t feel as &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; as the paste.  That I could live with but this review is really about the large tube - it&#x27;s terrible.  For whatever reason (probably the thick plastic and the shape), it&#x27;s very hard to squeeze it out and I can tell once it gets emptier, squeezing out the last parts will be extremely difficult (you won&#x27;t be able to roll this one up).  Very poor design.  I&#x27;ll stick with the regular tubes.</li>
    <li> We were using earthpaste toothpaste before switching to this one. I think this makes my teeth feel much cleaner and it has a much more pleasant taste. The tube is rather large though so this will last a very long time. Overall, very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Only reason I gave it 4/5 is because the tube is difficult to squeeze and can cause the toothpaste to end up smeared on the inside of the cap. The actual toothpaste is wonderful though!</li>
    <li> Love the gel toothpaste.. HATE the cover of the large tube. Its messy, and more like a hair gel cover.</li>
