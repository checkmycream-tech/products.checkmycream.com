    <li> This product was easy to order and came as described.  The product arrived on the stated delivery date.</li>
    <li> beautiful smell and good price</li>
    <li> Did not know you could find so many wonderful Dusting Powder until I searched AMAZON!  This one has a wonderful fragrance that any women would love to use!  Such a soft fragrance - just enough to give you a nice smell for others to enjoy!  Love this shopping at AMAZON..You will love this wonderful fragrance - just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> A gift for someone...nostaliic, always in good taste.  Lovely smell.</li>
    <li> love this. just wish i could buy in stores.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find I could still purchase this Bath Powder.  It is reasonable and since I use a lot of it, thats great.</li>
    <li> I had never used this before and I am very pleased with it. I&#x27;ll definitely order this again when I run out and would recommend it to others.  I will use the same company to do business with, too.</li>
    <li> Very quick service. Aunite was thrilled to life (since she&#x27;s 85, death is not a good choice of words!)I will purchase 2 more at X-mas time.</li>
    <li> Bought in connection with the Wind Song fragrance.</li>
    <li> Product recieved just as advertised by this company. All deliveries from this company arrived quickly after date of order. I am a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Nice light scent that I felt will go with everything. All four dusting powders were for gifts - I felt the name brand and scent were a classic, great box that did not need wrapping, just a bow.</li>
    <li> Product beautiful and elegant appearance Recommend to which this product</li>
    <li> I have used Wind Song powder and perfume for years. It has a very light clean fragrance. I receive alot of compliments when I use it, which is everyday. It hard to find the powder in stores so I order it on line.</li>
    <li> This is a very old drug store brand of powder. I don&#x27;t like it but my Mom loves it. just happy that it is still available for her.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this powder.</li>
    <li> This is how I know it&#x27;s Summer: when I bust out my Wind Song powder. I love it. It&#x27;s light and keeps me smelling daisy-fresh all day. I especially love it at night, because when I wake up, i smell all Wind Song-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always order it here because it&#x27;s easier to find than in the stores.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my mother.  The box arrived damaged</li>
    <li> it is so fantastic to find a supplier for this item. it is nearly impossible to find in any stores anymore, and is Momma&#x27;s favorite. what a joy to be able to supply her with this pleasure now and for as long as she lives. Thank you so very much for making her happy.</li>
    <li> I used this brand years ago but the powder smells too sweet not as I remembered it. It made a terrific gift for an older lady. The price was good and so was the shipping process. It arrived within a few days of ordering.</li>
    <li> My favorite, great price.</li>
    <li> Delivery was as described. Very happy with my Wind Song Dusting Powder. I&#x27;ve been using the Wind Song by Prince Matchabelli products for years and will continue to buy again.</li>
    <li> I needed to get a gift for a friends mother.  She recommended Powder Dust.  Came it a nice box.  The box itself has a really pretty smell;  hoping she will like it.</li>
    <li> I send this to my Mom who is in a nursing home.  It is easy for her to use.  She loves dusting powder, which is difficult to find, and ordering thru Amazon is so easy.  I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Mom has passed now, and I am so glad I bought her several of these, I know she loved it.</li>
    <li> Very pleasing perfume.</li>
    <li> For going on fifty years, this fragrance has been my husband&#x27;s favorite, yet the dusting powder is not available in most stores.</li>
    <li> I was so  happy to find this product, as this is what my sister really likes and hadn&#x27;t been able to find for over twenty years. She was so happy to receive this for Christmas and thinks it is amazing, better than she could remember.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother. She loves body powder and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores. The scent was nice.</li>
    <li> My favorite powder.  it lasts quite long, and is a soft, floral scent not too strong nor too weak.  price is reasonably, esp considering the quality of the item!</li>
    <li> bought it for my wife very nice</li>
    <li> Just what she wanted.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, and when I saw it on Amazon I just had to buy it.  I was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my Mother.  Since retail stores discontinued carrying it and seem to be unable (unwilling?)to order it for me, I looked on Amazon&#x27;s website.  As usual, it was available.  My order was very promptly received, in perfect condition and I have a very happy Mother.  Thank you very much.  I would not hesitate to order from this vendor in the future.</li>
    <li> I just LOVE  Wing Song..</li>
    <li> It reminds me of when this perfume first came out. I no longer wear a lot of perfume because I work in a hospital, but the dusting powder is really nice.</li>
    <li> I am Very Satisfied with the Wind Song Powder I purchased at Amazon.  It was exactly what I wanted. Thank you very much, Sincerely, Yvonne Durand</li>
    <li> This is a great body powder. Windsong has a wonderful light floral scent. Windsong has been around for a long time. It has a luscious floral scent that&#x27;s haunting but never overpowering. Nothing else smells like Windsong!</li>
    <li> My 86 year old mother has used this scent for years. So glad to find it !</li>
    <li> I have been using this bath powder for a few months and I love it. The large powder puff that comes with it make it so nice to use, and this powder has a clean delicate smell. I buy it for both my 93 year old mother and for myself. It is almost impossible to find dusting powder with a puff in the stores. I am so happy that I can easily order it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is an old scent but I like it better than White Diamonds. Smells really nice.  The fragrance is sweet but not too sweet but others can pick up on it in casual passing by.  I used to use Bond Street by Yardley and loved that but cannot find it anywhere.  You can get Wind Song Dusting Powder, 4 Ounce  for $11. or at least you could..  Once Amazon had this for $8-$9.  Walmart is also  a god place to get the Wind Song deodorizing aerosol for around $3.</li>
    <li> I think the zinc in this dusting powder is good for oily areas of the skin. Whatever, it has worked well for after bath.</li>
    <li> Love the powder puff talcum.  Puff puff!!  Wind Song is a classic scent.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Pleasant scent. Fairly easy to use. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I remember my grandmother using this dusting powder on us kids after bath time! I liked it then, and I used it on my kids when they were little. Glad Amazon carries it, so I can enjoy the scent,as well as the memories.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this before and will buy again.  The scent is perfect and not overbearing it is just perfect.</li>
    <li> I have ordered it before, but this time the fragrance was not as rich as in previous times. After I used it a bit, and the powder was looser, it improved somewhat. My main reason for ordering it instead of just getting something locally is that it is a favorite fragrance. My first one was a gift.</li>
    <li> I used Wind Song fragrance as a teenager, but obviously at 75 my olfactory sense must be quite different.  I found the powder scent overpowering.</li>
    <li> I first received Windsong from my favorit aunt, and I have loved it ever since.  Now that she&#x27;s gone, I use it because it reminds me of her.</li>
    <li> Great Product excellent service</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this scent, but this powder container does not have a way to contain the powder and the powder flies everywhere. (Unlike my other one purchased, a different manufacturer).</li>
    <li> Wife is a lifetime user of this product. And its arrival was perfect.</li>
    <li> Mom loved it. That&#x27;s all I care. She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;Very good deal and price was ok.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is the best place to purchase anything.</li>
    <li> got this for my mother for Christmas..she used to wear wind song when I was a kid.  Hadn&#x27;t been able to find this anywhere in the stores. She loved it and I was happy to get it for her. Shipping was no problem and it came in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice and serves its purpose well. It&#x27;s an old scent that still works subtly after all these years.</li>
    <li> A lot more flowery than I remember it but nice used sparingly.</li>
    <li> As soon as I broke open the paper cover and put some powder on the puff the aroma was so. Nice.  You just have to try it and you&#x27;ll know what I mean.</li>
    <li> This is my mother&#x27;s favorite fragrance.  I bought it for her.  When I smell it I am always reminded of her</li>
    <li> This powder has an awesome smell. Everytime I wear it, people ask me what I have on. Makes a great gift.</li>
    <li> Bought for mother in laws birthday. She loved it. I can&#x27;t seem to find sented bath and body powder in stores anymore. So glad I found it here!</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift and the person loved it!  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Wind Song Dusting Powder by Prince Matchabelli is a product that I have used for many years and wish to continue.</li>
    <li> Everything was as expected and arrived  on time.</li>
    <li> Like the powder but the scent has changed</li>
    <li> Can no longer find Wind Song Dusting Powder on the shelf at favorite shopping center.  So thankful we can order it on line.  Have used it for years and don&#x27;t want to have to do without it!</li>
    <li> Wife was very happy with this.  It came two days earlier than expected.  I found it hard to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> Very Happy to have found the Windsong powder available,as I had searched for it for a length of time. I have used Windsong powder for special occasions for a period of years.</li>
    <li> Just smelling Wind Song transports me back to Christmas at age 10 when I received Wind Song powder and cologne.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have used this since I was a teenager.  You can&#x27;t help but feel elegant,  The fragrance is just wonderful.</li>
    <li> She loves this product and it smells nice too. It was delivered fast and efficiently.</li>
    <li> The Wind song dusting powder has been my favorite for ever. I love the scent.  I found it on the internet and was so happy to as none of the stores in Coeur d&#x27; Alene are stocking it now and I hope it never goes out of your stock.&lt;br /&gt;The service was very good and quick.</li>
    <li> I have bought wind song powder for years- I love the sweet fragrance! But the order that I received this last time proved to be very disappointing!!!!!&#x27; As soon as I opened the first box I noticed there was no smell. Each day that I put it on was the same. I&#x27;m not sure why it has no fragrant smell at all. I&#x27;m thinking it was maybe an old box that you sent and the smell just disapated????? So every day when I put it on I keep hoping that it will have some smell from it but unfortunately it never doesn I guess it&#x27;s time to find another powder- even though I have never used anything else! Very disappointed customer</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful title.  Prince Matchabelli Wind Song has been a favorite of many women for years.  It is especially light in fragrance, yet not vague at all. One can smell the fragrance throughout the room! A great idea for  the &#x27;Hard to give to&#x27; lady in your life.</li>
    <li> Just as I remembered it.</li>
    <li> I should try the perfume someday - I do love the powder - smells very much like the Nina Ricci powder.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my mother.  She loves it</li>
    <li> This is a gift for a friend she loves this powder. Thank You</li>
    <li> Got the smile I was looking for from my mom!</li>
    <li> This product is my wife&#x27;s favorite dusting powder and I have been buying it for her for over 55 years!&lt;br /&gt;This supplier was prompt and it arrived in excellent condition. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my third box, so you see, I do love it. An old stand-by. Not heavy or really strong smelling</li>
    <li> I have had this product before and absolutely loved the smell.  The powder in this container didn&#x27;t have&lt;br /&gt;the same great smell, to me, anyway.  I will use it but would like to know why it doesn&#x27;t smell the same&lt;br /&gt;as what I had.  Maybe it is just me. I&#x27;m sure most would be happy with the Wind Song, it usually is&lt;br /&gt;great.</li>
    <li> I have bought a variety of dusting powders, and this is by far the most fragrant one I have ever encountered. OHHHH I simply am enamored with it. It is vantage bliss.</li>
    <li> I just purchased my fourth container of Wind Song Dusting Powder.  It is hard to find in the store, so I am so happy that Amazon carries it.  The scent is feminine and classic and the talc imparts just enough fragrance that it is enjoyable but never overwhelming.  I don&#x27;t think there is anything as luxurious as stepping out of a bath or shower and applying a lusciously scented powder with a soft puff, and Wind Song is definitely one of the better ones - and reasonably priced as well.</li>
    <li> Arrived brand new. Smells just the same as years ago. Has its own little powder puff inside. Hard plastic case which is good</li>
    <li> My aunt who is 80 plus has used this for many year but was unable to find it in the department stores.  I located this on Amazon and gave to her as a Christmas present.  She could not have been happier.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for her.</li>
    <li> Just like I remember...light and clean fragrance</li>
    <li> After much searching, it seems this product can only be purchased online.  I was afraid it was no longer available and was glad to see I could get the gift through amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I love this dusting powder.  Years ago...like in the early &#x27;60s I got acquainted with Wind Song cologne.  I love the clean smell.  Recently I started using dusting powder and was excited to find the Wind Song Dusting Powder.</li>
    <li> This fragrance has been one of my wife&#x27;s favorites for our 50 years of marriage.  It never tires of its excellence.</li>
    <li> What a find. I have been looking for some new dusting powder in the scents of the 1960&#x27;s and this seller provided it... The price was perfect- shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT 3 OF THESE, GAVE ONE AS A GIFT.  SHE WILL BE BUYING MORE OFF YOU.&lt;br /&gt;THE PRODUCT WAS JUST WHAT I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR.  SO GLAD I HAVE FOUND WHERE TO BUY IT!</li>
    <li> A little too sweet smelling for my taste.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and rec&#x27;d it in a very timely manner!!</li>
    <li> I remember this scent from when i was in college decades ago.  I have ordered the powder and perfume.  Good quality, lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> This was purchased both for me and as a gift.  It arrived promptly &amp; was exactly as advertised.  Always a pleasure to order something with confidence that it will be exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This is an all time favorite of us older ladies. We like to smell like we did when we were young!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Windsong perfume and dusting powder since I was 14 years old and am now 66.  It is the only perfume I will wear and get lots of compliments when I have it on.</li>
    <li> I love the scent. I actually think it works. I am not too much of sweaty person. I purchased this after seeing a video on youtube showing that you can use dusting powder to make your lipstick stays... But I fell in love when I read reviews about it. So I just ordered it. I love the scent knowing that I am 27 might help you ordering :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Wind Song, the EDC; this is very much the same scent, but man!  It&#x27;s really, really intense.  Maybe it was just because I was applying it above the waist, but it was a lot stronger than I like when I would use the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I diluted the powder about 4x with corn starch and it&#x27;s much lighter; as an upside, this means I&#x27;ll get more use out of one box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is pretty generic, with a round &amp;#34;Wind Song&amp;#34; sticker on the top of it; mine was kind of off-center.  It looks nicer with the sticker off, but I imagine actual fancy people don&#x27;t use the powder straight from the factory container anyway.</li>
    <li> An old but familiar scent from my past. Since i cannot smell anymore I like using something that I&#x27;m sure I liked the smell in the past.</li>
    <li> This is my third order of Wind Song .... it smells exactly like it did back in the 70s .... absolutely enchanting. i order it for my mother in law too. we are both extremely pleased with the powder and tbe service.</li>
    <li> Wind Song Dusting Powder iis my mother&#x27;s favorite beauty product and so we get it for her every Christmas. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> The scent of Wind Song take me back to college days of 50 years ago. So sweet, but fresh also. I use it along with the spay cologne and feel ready for the day after a shower. I stick with one or 2 favorite scents, even though they may not be as &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34; as the high end celebrity named scents or expensive brands. Thanks, Prince Matchabelli, where ever you are.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my Mom every year for her birthday.  It&#x27;s so much easier to buy it online that to run around to different stores only to be disappointed.  She really likes it a lot!</li>
    <li> After my favorite perfume was discontinued, (Enjoli), I searched for just the right cologne to replace it. Windsong is my choice. It suits me. This is my first time using the bath powder and I&#x27;m loving it. It gives me the hint of fragrance I want when I&#x27;m not wearing the cologne. I am glad to find I can get both Windsong cologne and bath powder from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance.  Delightful softness.</li>
    <li> My dearest wife has continues to use Wind Song&lt;br /&gt;( cologne, dusting powder, etc.)for over 50 years. What better testimony can I give? It is sort of her trademark if you will. So it naturally follows that I  like the fragrances on her too.</li>
    <li> my wife, and as a result, I, like the smell pretty and the feel. thanks</li>
    <li> Smells just like I remember.  Too bad they don&#x27;t make perfumed corn starch instead of talc. Still glad I purchased it and I will enjoy using it because it&#x27;s light and fresh, not overwhelming. The scent lasts for several hours.</li>
    <li> This is a good bargain.  The smell is pleasant and reminds me of sweet smelling flowers.  It goes nicely with my spray parfum!</li>
    <li> The smell is strong but it is good, I like the light smell. Maybe the young people won&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Purchased for an elderly friend, she loves this product very much.  You made her day!  Will make another purchase when she runs out.</li>
    <li> my mom is in a nursing home and loves scent of this powder.  The nurses love it too.  a win win in my opinion.</li>
    <li> The item was bigger than expected which is great. Mother is going to love it. Smells amazing and it&#x27;s light. Thank you!</li>
    <li> NIce to have this after a shower, Smells so nice. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love dusting powder and particularly Windsong.  It is very refreshing and I use it after each and every bath or shower!</li>
    <li> My mother who is 77, loves this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Prince Matchabelli&#x27;s lotions and perfumes for years but the dusting powder I just received doesn&#x27;t smell anything like it. Hardly has any scent! Very disapointed. I purchased two, one for me and the other one for a gift. Hope she likes the pretty box.</li>
