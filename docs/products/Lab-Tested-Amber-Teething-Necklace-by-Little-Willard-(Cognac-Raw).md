      <li>Anything would be better than my infant son having so many problems with teething.  </li>
      <li>It actually got warm in my hand!!!</li>
      <li>and my daughter is doing so much better with minimum teething pain.</li>
      <li>Love love love</li>
      <li>The owner emailed me within a day of receiving it which is lovely.</li>
      <li>excellent customer service and commitment to giving back!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already noticed a decrease in fussing and drooling, and he looks adorable in it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am excited to put this on my son when he wakes up from his nap :)</li>
      <li>Seems to work as far as I can tell, I love the color of the beads very accurate</li>
      <li>I also LOVE how this company has great customer service, and actually emailed me after I ordered explaining that they would refund me completely if I didn&#x27;t think the product worked on my child.  </li>
      <li>Item was as described and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>the cognac is a beautiful color, not too feminine for our little guy and you can tell it is assembled well.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical about these at first, but have heard many awesome reviews.</li>
      <li>and he was as calm as he was during our emergency appointment.</li>
      <li>We have found these to be very effective with our little one.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well made and just the right length.</li>
      <li>Not only does it come in cute packaging</li>
      <li>We got our new Amber necklace yesterday and put it on our baby right away.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend these!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m amazed at how much they help with our 6 month olds drooling.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Less droll and much more content.</li>
      <li>I tell everyone about Baltic Amber and recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s a little bit of a risk, they work better if you don&#x27;t take them off at night.</li>
      <li>I really like this product so far.</li>
      <li>These beads definitely work and they look exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I got it for a new baby but ended up putting it on my 20 mo old after he fell and knocked out a front tooth.</li>
      <li>He doesn&#x27;t mess with the necklace, so I&#x27;m comfortable with this arrangement.</li>
      <li>Turned around and bought another necklace for my son who showed his classic teething signs the next day.</li>
      <li>After a week of wearing this, I can say that his drooling has almost completely stopped, and he actually popped a new tooth this week</li>
      <li>It seemed to soothe him and calm him down a bit.</li>
      <li>I ordered the raw cognac for my almost 4 month old, the raw finish is so lovely!</li>
      <li>We actually left our first necklace in a hotel and when we couldn&#x27;t find them after going back to look for them we ordered another necklace before we left the hotel parking lot!  </li>
      <li>I have never written a review before so please bare with</li>
      <li>We took them off for the first few days and</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really seem to be working for my little guy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so bummed that this didn&#x27;t work for our little guy, I had such high hopes!</li>

<li> but I LOVE that they donate HALF their profit to the orphans in Kaliningrad in partnership with with change30.org !!!!!</li>
<li> I really like this little necklace!</li>
<li> We have kept it on our son in hopes that it will work its magic, but so far no luck for us :(</li>
<li> He definitely doesn&#x27;t seem to be in as much pain, and we haven&#x27;t given Motrin since he started wearing them, whereas before we were giving it to him at least once per day, especially at night, to settle him down.</li>
<li> She is also less gassy from the extra chomping.</li>
<li> This is the second little Willard necklace I have bought.</li>
<li> and if I have to buy any amber for the babies again I will definitely buy it from Little Willard</li>
<li> and we had a rough morning.</li>
<li> After doing a lot of research I decided to order a few (each from a different company).</li>
<li> but now I tuck the necklace into his PJ&#x27;s and watch the monitor carefully.  </li>
<li> It just took a little long for shipping.</li>
<li> The beads seem really small and the necklace seems like it is rather long and unsafe.  </li>
<li> Much less drooling, and slightly less hands in the mouth.</li>
<li> He is definitely less fussy when wearing his.  </li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t seem to help my little boy with his teething, but again, item was as described.</li>
<li> but thankful it does for my little one.</li>
<li> I just received my little Willard necklace and I am a little bummed after reading the rave reviews on this product.</li>
<li> but it took a few days of wearing it</li>
<li> These seem to be working for my son after a few weeks.  </li>
<li> Usually he is a grumpy, fussy mess.  </li>
<li> lent the previous necklace to my niece to try out as she was having a really hard time with teething.</li>
<li> /&gt;First I want to start out by saying I order the raw cognac amber teething necklace for my son from this company.</li>
<li> My LO is drooling less and seems to be less uncomfortable due to her teething.</li>
<li> I think I will try a different brand :-(</li>
<li> I was very skeptical about this, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really seem to be working for my little guy.</li>
    <li> The seller was very courteous and the item arrived promptly.They offer a 1 year warranty as well which is great! I was skeptical about these at first, but have heard many awesome reviews. My son is 4 months and is teething and drooling everywhere! I put the necklace on him as soon as it arrived and the next day there was NO drool! These beads definitely work and they look exactly as described. I would definitely buy these again!</li>
    <li> We got our new Amber necklace yesterday and put it on our baby right away. He&#x27;s been so restless and crabby, waiting for his teeth to pop through. I&#x27;ve already noticed a decrease in fussing and drooling, and he looks adorable in it. I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so bummed that this didn&#x27;t work for our little guy, I had such high hopes! But I am still giving it five stars because I know it works for SO many people, and what a wonderful company to work with. The owner emailed me within a day of receiving it which is lovely.

    <li> I have never written a review before so please bare with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I want to start out by saying I order the raw cognac amber teething necklace for my son from this company. After doing a lot of research I decided to order a few (each from a different company). I did the heat test on the one I ordered from here and it worked!!! It actually got warm in my hand!!! The others did not. I am 100% posting this on fb and telling anyone I can about how much I love this company! Not only does it come in cute packaging but I LOVE that they donate HALF their profit to the orphans in Kaliningrad in partnership with with change30.org !!!!! No I was not paid or got anything for posting this but I am one happy momma!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am excited to put this on my son when he wakes up from his nap :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the item. Was so sceptical of the necklaces but it took a few days of wearing it and my daughter is doing so much better with minimum teething pain. It just took a little long for shipping. It was suppose to be here on a Thursday and it didn&#x27;t come until Tuesday the following week.</li>
    <li> Item was as described and arrived quickly. It didn&#x27;t seem to help my little boy with his teething, but again, item was as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m leaving the second review, because I did buy another necklace from the seller. All I can say it&#x27;s amazing and if I have to buy any amber for the babies again I will definitely buy it from Little Willard</li>
    <li> These seem to be working for my son after a few weeks.  Though it says not to, and I know it&#x27;s a little bit of a risk, they work better if you don&#x27;t take them off at night. We took them off for the first few days and then honestly I just forgot one night but now I tuck the necklace into his PJ&#x27;s and watch the monitor carefully.  He doesn&#x27;t mess with the necklace, so I&#x27;m comfortable with this arrangement. Much less drooling, and slightly less hands in the mouth. He definitely doesn&#x27;t seem to be in as much pain, and we haven&#x27;t given Motrin since he started wearing them, whereas before we were giving it to him at least once per day, especially at night, to settle him down.</li>
    <li> Just got it today and within about 30min my son went from fussy to asleep. I hope this continues to work</li>
    <li> Love love love love this Baltic Amber necklace!!! Works wonders and everyone with a teething baby needs one! Not only is it an amazing product but the customer service is superb as well!!!!! A++++++++ I&#x27;ll will buying more for me and others I know with babies!!!!!!!! Love love love</li>
    <li> Wonderful company! Great customer service. We are very happy!</li>
    <li> Love love love our Amber beads! We actually left our first necklace in a hotel and when we couldn&#x27;t find them after going back to look for them we ordered another necklace before we left the hotel parking lot!  So happy we were able to use our Amazon PRIME to get them to us in just two days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed at how much they help with our 6 month olds drooling. When she&#x27;s wearing her necklace she doesn&#x27;t drool unless she is chewing on a toy.  So thankful a friend introduced us to the beads!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work, shipped it back and UPS lost my shipment so I was charged anyways!</li>
    <li> Well packaged, great product! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Excellent!  We have found these to be very effective with our little one.  He is definitely less fussy when wearing his.  Highly recommend these!  Also, they donate to orphans where the amber used to make these is sourced.  Win/Win!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Anything would be better than my infant son having so many problems with teething.  After a week of wearing this, I can say that his drooling has almost completely stopped, and he actually popped a new tooth this week and I didn&#x27;t even notice!  Usually he is a grumpy, fussy mess.  I&#x27;m sold.  I just placed ANOTHER order for a second necklace for his twin sister today.  I also LOVE how this company has great customer service, and actually emailed me after I ordered explaining that they would refund me completely if I didn&#x27;t think the product worked on my child.  Not to mention they donate part of the proceeds to an orphanage.  If you are a skeptic like me, take a chance!  You will be pleased!</li>
    <li> I really like this little necklace! I got it for a new baby but ended up putting it on my 20 mo old after he fell and knocked out a front tooth. It seemed to soothe him and calm him down a bit. The dentist was amazed I hadn&#x27;t given him any Tylenol and he was as calm as he was during our emergency appointment. It&#x27;s well made and just the right length. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> So far, so awesome! Love this necklace, not to mention its beautiful packaging/branding! I ordered the raw cognac for my almost 4 month old, the raw finish is so lovely! Here&#x27;s to hoping it helps with my fussy, teething babe.</li>
    <li> This necklace works awesome. My LO is drooling less and seems to be less uncomfortable due to her teething. She is also less gassy from the extra chomping. I left it off in the am after she woke up and we had a rough morning. Won&#x27;t forget next time.</li>
    <li> I put the necklace on my baby earlier today and already notice a difference this evening. Less droll and much more content. I really like this product so far. Thank you!</li>
    <li> she loved it! Hope it helps with the teething!</li>
    <li> Seems to work as far as I can tell, I love the color of the beads very accurate</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had this for months and it&#x27;s still in tact. Wonderful, especially for chikdren</li>
    <li> Great quality and beautiful!!</li>
    <li> This is the second little Willard necklace I have bought. lent the previous necklace to my niece to try out as she was having a really hard time with teething. I tell everyone about Baltic Amber and recommend it highly. Turned around and bought another necklace for my son who showed his classic teething signs the next day. We just can&#x27;t go without it. I&#x27;ve heard it doesn&#x27;t work for all kids but thankful it does for my little one. This company is really amazing- excellent customer service and commitment to giving back!</li>
    <li> I just received my little Willard necklace and I am a little bummed after reading the rave reviews on this product. The beads seem really small and the necklace seems like it is rather long and unsafe.  I think I will try a different brand :-(</li>
