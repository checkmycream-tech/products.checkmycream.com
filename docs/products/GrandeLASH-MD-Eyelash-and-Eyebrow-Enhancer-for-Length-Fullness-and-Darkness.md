<li> Been using this for over a year now,  Lashes grow long - only wish they got thicker</li>
<li> when I when I wear mascara my lashes are so long that they touch my glasses.</li>
<li> Once your lashes get to a desired length, it&#x27;s only needed every other day.</li>
<li> Lasts for a very long time.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;it seems to work but has gone dry way too fast&lt;</li>
<li> It took about a month to see any real changes, and my lashes still aren&#x27;t anything to write home about bare, but with mascara on they practically look fake again!  </li>
<li> Not like other mascaras that run out in two weeks.</li>
<li> After that just at bedtime, and now about every other night.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using latisse and the generic latisse in the past and this product did not make my lashes any longer at all.</li>
<li> I read about this on the Cut, some makeup artist recommended it for growing in brows, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try at half the price of Latisse with no risk of iris darkening.  </li>
<li> I have used this product for at least 3 months and if you use it nightly, your lashes will get long.  </li>
<li> After an appointment with my ophthalmologist in Dec. I was missing lashes in two places.  </li>
<li> /&gt;i ordered a two to three month supply and got one tube that dried up in a few weeks&lt;</li>
<li> My eyelashes were always long, but thin.</li>
<li> I had a bad experience after eyelash extension and this product has given me my eye lashes back</li>
<li> My lashes were sad and stubbly from 3 years of extensions, and I&#x27;m scared of Latisse because I have green eyes.  </li>
<li> but I work hard for my money and this is just wrong.</li>
<li> but im confused as to the my three month order</li>

    <li> I love this stuff. Had amazing results n when I when I wear mascara my lashes are so long that they touch my glasses. I recommend and use faithfully to get to the maintenance phase.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic, but this stuff ACTUALLY WORKS.  My lashes were sad and stubbly from 3 years of extensions, and I&#x27;m scared of Latisse because I have green eyes.  I read about this on the Cut, some makeup artist recommended it for growing in brows, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try at half the price of Latisse with no risk of iris darkening.  It took about a month to see any real changes, and my lashes still aren&#x27;t anything to write home about bare, but with mascara on they practically look fake again!  I will be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for women with short eyelashes.  I have used this product for at least 3 months and if you use it nightly, your lashes will get long.  I love this reduction and plan on continuing to use it.</li>
    <li> Eyebrow growth over a month use. Very good!</li>
    <li> The aethetician I regularly see told me about this product. I was skeptical, but have to say I&#x27;ve had remarkably good results. The first six weeks I used it mornings and bedtime. After that just at bedtime, and now about every other night. One tube goes a long way - you would certainly see results after using one tube and be able to decide if it is worth it for yourself. Now I have my eyelashes dyed once a month and they look so good that I only need to use mascara for a special occasion or an evening out.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. The product says it takes up to 3 months to see results, and I&#x27;m patient. I&#x27;ve seen the results on a friend who has been using it for three months and her lashes look amazingly full and long!</li>
    <li> Worked as described on my lashes...not so successful on my brows....but the results on my lashes made the product  well worth the purchase price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a months now -- great product that really works.  My eyelashes were always long, but thin. This seems to thicken them too. There is no color and the serum is only applied once a day. Once your lashes get to a desired length, it&#x27;s only needed every other day.</li>
    <li> Awesome but got to stick with the plan</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all. I&#x27;ve been using latisse and the generic latisse in the past and this product did not make my lashes any longer at all. I wish I could return the product.</li>
    <li> This really worked for me easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, however it does cause a little irritation at first.  If you are older, it is advised to start with 2 times a day.  I am very happy with this product and I am ordering more.</li>

    <li> Love this product!  Have gotten MANY compliments on my lashes!  REALLY works!</li>
    <li> It works. Just a liitle pricier than some of the others that​ also work the same.</li>
    <li> Great product, been using it twice a day and my lashes look better. I had a bad experience after eyelash extension and this product has given me my eye lashes back</li>
    <li> this is th esecond time i have ordered this product&lt;br /&gt;it seems to work but has gone dry way too fast&lt;br /&gt;i ordered a two to three month supply and got one tube that dried up in a few weeks&lt;br /&gt;i would like to order more but im confused as to the my three month order</li>
    <li> After an appointment with my ophthalmologist in Dec. I was missing lashes in two places.  I had a friend refer me to Grande Lash MD. and thought I would try it.  I followed the instructions as recommended and I noticed in 3 weeks the lashes coming in thicker and  longer  than I had had in years. Great product!</li>
    <li> I made my first purchase of this product at a local salon. I love it, it works ! I paid $70 at the salon and thought maybe Amazon will have it.&lt;br /&gt;I logged on and there it was so I ordered, plus ordered the lash one only for my co-worker. The price for my co-worker was $39.85, my purchase was $48.95 because it mentions the brows. I get the package, the products are the same thing, no difference. What a rip off, they put a different word in the description and charge $9.48 more. So bottom line don&#x27;t pay the extra for the word Brow like I did. I consider this consumer fraud.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know about others but I work hard for my money and this is just wrong. Enjoy the product, my lashes are amazing !</li>
