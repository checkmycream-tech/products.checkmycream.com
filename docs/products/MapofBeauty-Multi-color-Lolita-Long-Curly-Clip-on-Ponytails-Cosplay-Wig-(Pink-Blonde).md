      <li>I Highly recommend this wig and this seller!</li>
      <li>I could I&#x27;d wear it as much as possible!&lt;br</li>
      <li>The picture is just me holding it straight out of the box without the pigtails.</li>
      <li>but really that&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s sooooo curly.</li>
      <li>Really works well all together.</li>
      <li>but I it is not thin at all.</li>
      <li>Thought I&#x27;d try out this one because I really like the Lolita wig look.  </li>
      <li>was individually wrapped in a net which was nice</li>

      <li>Bangs very long, but easy to fix to the side.</li>
      <li>It came two days earlier than expected, and in short, I would definitely buy from this seller again :D</li>
      <li>Hair comes off with the slightest move and the curls straighten out over time its a but hard to maintain but overall its really cute and adorable.</li>
      <li>Soft and looks exactly like what you see</li>
      <li>The wig is all full of hair and the net doesn&#x27;t show up.</li>

      <li>This wig looks just like the picture--cute, full, long waves.  </li>
      <li>Mine came thick and super quick!</li>
      <li>The picture shows it more pink with some blonde</li>
      <li>I got this early.  </li>
      <li>The bangs are super long so you&#x27;ll have to clip them back or trim them, your choice&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a half and half with the coloring.</li>
      <li>BE AWARE THIS IS YELLOW AND PINK.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so thick and full.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super thick and it came with 2 wig caps.</li>

    <li> Great quality. Definitely worth the price. Really thick with a great color. it Looks good with or without the pony tails. With the pony tails it&#x27;s a tad heavy but there&#x27;s no way to avoid that. Ordered on November 30 arrived December 2. will buy from again! !! Best wig I&#x27;ve bought so far</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s exactly as pictured and it&#x27;s easy to attach the pigtails or take them off and just have a curly wig.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Ok I love this wig so much. It&#x27;s so thick and full. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments. The detachable pigtails are really nice. Looks so good with and without them</li>
    <li> I got this early.  It came well wrapped each piece was individually wrapped in a net which was nice I read before buying this it came tangled but really that&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s sooooo curly. I used my wig comb it with through it well. My only issue with it is that is runs very small. I have a small head and it&#x27;s still a bit tight but it stays on great. The bangs are super long but with some smart cutting choices it can be fixed. It comes with two black wig caps so that&#x27;s awesome. The hair is a bit thin on the sides with out the clip in ponytails but all in all it is worth the money spent and am very happy I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is the best wig I have ever owned. It&#x27;s amazing and super cute and beautiful! ❤ I highly recommend this! It&#x27;s super thick and it came with 2 wig caps. It&#x27;s every comfortable and I am excited to use it for my Lolita Cosplay!</li>
    <li> Yes this wig is hot and heavy but it stays in place! It&#x27;s very cute, comes with a wig cap and is very high quality. It&#x27;s the softest wig I&#x27;ve ever felt.</li>
    <li> //becomes Sakura Katana CHAAAAAAANNNN//</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really high standard quality my ponytails are a bit rough looking</li>
    <li> Bangs very long, but easy to fix to the side. Over all a very good wig, rely soft.</li>
    <li> Hair comes off with the slightest move and the curls straighten out over time its a but hard to maintain but overall its really cute and adorable. I love how the pig tails are detachable (is that even a word) its so kawaii! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I just received this wig and i love it. Mine came thick and super quick! Clips are a little heavy but not bad at all. Only one problem for me. How am i not going to wear this to school tomorrow?!?!?!?</li>
    <li> Loveeeee it, made me looks so cute lol. I would buy again, excellent quality for price.</li>
    <li> This is super cute and everything came in nicely. I love that the clips are the color of the yellow. Really works well all together. I don&#x27;t consider the pig tails to be heavy at all. The pink is a beautiful kind of pink. The wig is all full of hair and the net doesn&#x27;t show up.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for my granddaughter as part of her Halloween costume.  It is gorgeous!  I had ordered a similar wig from ebay and it was cheap, thin, and not as pictured.  This wig looks just like the picture--cute, full, long waves.  We can&#x27;t wait for Halloween now!  Thank you MapofBeauty for such a quality product!!!!  Oh, and shipping was superb also!</li>
    <li> Can totally see the cap</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little upset at the fact that it doesn&#x27;t match the picture (for the pink/blonde). The picture shows it more pink with some blonde which is what I thought I was ordering/receiving but it turned out to be more of a mixture of the two colors. It&#x27;s more like a half and half with the coloring. However it is still a nice wig and I can still use it for something else so it&#x27;s not too big of a deal. The picture is just me holding it straight out of the box without the pigtails. The curls look nice as well without me touching them.</li>
    <li> A LOT more blonde than in the picture which was upsetting and the I saw how tangled the darn thing was. Not so good.</li>
    <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so kawaii ^^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could I&#x27;d wear it as much as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair is soft, it doesn&#x27;t shed too much and it came really quickly which was the best part :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pigtails are removeable and its cute both ways. The bangs are super long so you&#x27;ll have to clip them back or trim them, your choice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d totally recommend this wig</li>
    <li> Good quality will buy again</li>
    <li> It came in right on time before Halloween, I had many compliments on this piece. Very easy to care for and it was a bit heavy so make sure you brace yourself for the night lol but either from that it is a great wig :) totally enjoyed dressing up in it for Halloween</li>
    <li> This wig is gorgeous! Some people say it&#x27;s a bit thin but I it is not thin at all. I could not see the cap underneath and the pigtails attach beautifully! It&#x27;s a very gorgeous and vivid color and it arrived to my door very fast! I Highly recommend this wig and this seller! Awesome product and exactly what I wanted and was expecting! Perfect!</li>
    <li> This wig was FANTASTIC!!! My cosplay went super well because of this wig! I barely had to style it, which is rare with this sort of thing... it comes as the picture shows, only with a bit more blonde but that&#x27;s okay, I didn&#x27;t mind ^u^ I was happy with the overall quality of the wig. It came two days earlier than expected, and in short, I would definitely buy from this seller again :D</li>
    <li> my daughter looked adorable in this</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d try out this one because I really like the Lolita wig look.  This was the cheapest one I could find, so it explains how when I got it it was alright.  The top of the wig is pretty spotty, you can see the net under it when you are up close.  Other than that the cap is smaller than the other one I have, so it barely fits my head.  If I could redo things I&#x27;d probably save my money and get a cheaper one without the ponytails or pitch in for a more expensive one that would be thicker.</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig. The most gorgeous shade of cotton candy pink with subtle blonde highlights. Very soft, easy to de tangle by finger combing. Ponytails clip on easily, looks good with or without them. Plenty of hair, none of the cap underneath shows. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> BE AWARE THIS IS YELLOW AND PINK. I didn&#x27;t see the multicolor in the photo and was shocked when it came. I still used it and it&#x27;s a very beautiful wig, though the back of the base wig gets tangled easily. Still can be used for a great Junko Enoshima, Clover field or whatever you need it for.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s so cute!! 10/10 would recommend to all of my friends. looks just like the picture too!!</li>
    <li> Everything I expected.  Great seller. Ty</li>
    <li> Soft and looks exactly like what you see</li>
