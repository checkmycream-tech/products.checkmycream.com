      <li>and I was able to use it for a week</li>
      <li>I love mine and it had made a huge improvement on how my skin looks and feels after a cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;Andrea</li>
      <li>bought one for my younger sister as a gift and shel also loved it!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use/charge/operate.</li>
      <li>Easy.</li>
      <li>The replacement heads arrived quickly and they are authentic.</li>
      <li>If anyone can shed some light the usage of this system, please do.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the timer feature on this product.</li>

      <li>Replacement heads are available.</li>
      <li>The instructions state that it must charge for 18 hours before first use, which I did, so don&#x27;t expect to be able to use it upon arrival.  </li>
      <li>If you want to clean your face for a longer time you can do up to 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>The brush is gentle, easy to clean, and easy to replace.</li>
      <li>My skin already  looks more vibrant!</li>
      <li>I am happy to say that if I closed my eyes and used this and a Clarisonic</li>
      <li>Loved this cleansing brush but, unfortunately, only got to use it about six times before it quit working.  </li>
      <li>This seems to work well, and my skin looks better, although it is much drier than it was.</li>
      <li>My face is kind of sensitive</li>
      <li>It is a sleek design and super lightweight.</li>
      <li>I ordered from the Amazon supplier who was kind enough to reply to my downgrade.</li>
      <li>I am definately getting my money&#x27;s worth and then some.</li>
      <li>I love it thus far.</li>
      <li>I saw a difference the first time I used it my skin was glowing.</li>
      <li>Overall, I love this system and would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a leg and arm on a clarisonic system.</li>
      <li>Works the same way as clarisonic, but with more settings.</li>
      <li>I purchased this after reading the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
      <li>but overall I enjoy this product.</li>
      <li>The battery indicator light remained white and the product never beeped indicating a charge was needed.  </li>
      <li>She now wants to get</li>
      <li>It really is a Lemon</li>
      <li>, transaction was smooth but the brush was defective , the brush rattled and i dont think the head snapped on properly.</li>
      <li>Again, no beeping or red light blinking telling me that it needed charged.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I cannot compare to the clarisonic spin brushes as I have not used those, but in my research a comparable clairsonic spin brush would cost twice as much.  </li>
      <li>but I can not complain really about the xnovo.</li>
      <li>This item had my skin clear, smooth, and with smaller pores within the first week of use.  </li>
      <li>I was skeptical of not going for a more known brand like Clarisonic, but I&#x27;m glad.</li>
      <li>After the charge I was able to use it 3 times (total of 6 minutes) before the same &amp;#34;dying&amp;#34; process happened.  </li>
      <li>I find the Lemon Sonic not only equal but even better than the clairisonic brand.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend anyone regardless of age.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it if you can&#x27;t afford the SonicCare product.  </li>
      <li>So high tech with that magnet on it.</li>
      <li>I used to have the clarisonic for a few years and when it broke, I shopped around for a more affordable alternative.</li>
      <li>According to the directions the item is fully charged when the white indicator light is solid and not blinking.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a Boomer and have very sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>This is exactly like a clarasonic, only cheaper!</li>
      <li>An added benefit is my mom has really sensitive skin</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m giving it five stars.</li>
      <li>However, it died 6 weeks later - completely died and will not charge at all.  </li>
      <li>, I got the pink one, which I was really stoked about, but wasn&#x27;t expecting...  </li>
      <li>and this product comes with a sensitive brush head and has different speeds.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It comes with 2 main brushes, 1 with harder bristles and 1 with softer bristles.</li>
      <li>The brush just vibrates vs moving and the bristles aren&#x27;t as firm as the higher end ones.</li>
      <li>You can set it for high or low speed, with already timed intervals for 20 secs on forehead, 20 on chin, and 10 sec on each cheek.</li>

<li> (this equals roughly 14 minutes of use).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was looking for a cleansing brush similar to the Clarasonic but not the hefty price and i got this item, transaction was smooth but the brush was defective , the brush rattled and i dont think the head snapped on properly. this brush got some nice features but unfortunately i got a bad one, so i had to return it</li>
    <li> This seems to work well, and my skin looks better, although it is much drier than it was. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it had a timer; also, mine came with NO instructions AT ALL. Nothing but a rather intricate and impressive box. But otherwise, love it, and have tested the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; bit extensively; my favorite place to use it is in the shower.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with any instructions, but works beautifully. The only problem is when the battery is low, it continues to beep until you plug it in</li>
    <li> It vibrates and does not rotate, which I like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Boomer and have very sensitive skin.  I had been using a Olay Circular motion system.  I feel my skin is cleaner and clearer.  I use it after I use a makeup cleasing wipe before bed.  This product is the best I&#x27;ve used so far.  I highly recommend it if you can&#x27;t afford the SonicCare product.  After a while I plan on using it in the morning as well.  I&#x27;ll let you know.  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> After using my friend&#x27;s Clarisonic for a couple of days I knew I needed to get one, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100+. I am one of those people that over-researches products before I buy them and felt as though I was taking a leap of faith with the few customer reviews for this product.&lt;br /&gt;  I am happy to say that if I closed my eyes and used this and a Clarisonic I would not know the difference. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and my skin feels like silk. It&#x27;s been working so well that my my has notice how my skin has improved, tried it and now is using it herself (with a different brush head). She now wants to get one.&lt;br /&gt;  If you want a Clarisonic but do not want to pay that amount get this! An added benefit is my mom has really sensitive skin and this product comes with a sensitive brush head and has different speeds.&lt;br /&gt;  End of story...Do It!</li>
    <li> This item had my skin clear, smooth, and with smaller pores within the first week of use.  Really great item, great bang for the buck.  I cannot compare to the clarisonic spin brushes as I have not used those, but in my research a comparable clairsonic spin brush would cost twice as much.  Seller DR_Bhoom is incredibly prompt and helpful as well.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift,. about two weeks after using it will no longer turn on, no instructions.  Of course I was one day late to return.  Do not buy this product!! It really is a Lemon</li>
    <li> Im a guy, so this might offer additional perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to catch an episode/segment of Dr. Oz who said men could benefit from clearer skin by using a cleaning system for the face. He was speaking my demographic (mid 40&#x27;s- 50&#x27;s) so I paid even more attention. He said not to spend a lot of money on a system, so I came across this. I have nothing to compare it to, other than price. I do know it has helped clarify my face more than I imagined. I break out on my forehead from long distance running, and my face was starting to show age spots (from being in the sun); this, along with vitamin C, is helping quite a bit. It&#x27;s easy to use/charge/operate. I use it with an Origin Balance face cleaner recommended by a girlfriend. Just a dab on a wet face, spread it around to foam and use the Sonic. 1 or 2 x day. Easy. No problems with the device not working. Beeps when it&#x27;s time to rotate it to next part of 4 parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am having a difficult time finding replacement heads. I&#x27;m skeptical about ordering them direct from the XNOVI website; it doesn&#x27;t appear to be a robust site, lacking information on the company. Downgrading my rating as a result of not being able to find replacement heads, rending this product useless after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/12/2014: Replacement heads are available. I ordered from the Amazon supplier who was kind enough to reply to my downgrade. The replacement heads arrived quickly and they are authentic. Thank you, sir! Review is back to 5 stars. This product is a great buy.</li>
    <li> This is exactly like a clarasonic, only cheaper! I love mine and it had made a huge improvement on how my skin looks and feels after a cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;Andrea</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I cannot give a proper review as there were not instructions and I am not sure how to use the item.  If anyone can shed some light the usage of this system, please do.</li>
    <li> Took forever to deliver but overall I enjoy this product. I saw a difference the first time I used it my skin was glowing.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and was told it worked great!  However, it died 6 weeks later - completely died and will not charge at all.  I found this out from the person I gave the gift to 3 days after the end of the refund date, very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the timer feature on this product. The brush is gentle, easy to clean, and easy to replace. My skin has shown an improvement in appearance after a few weeks of using the Lemon. I was skeptical of not going for a more known brand like Clarisonic, but I&#x27;m glad. I am definately getting my money&#x27;s worth and then some.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the clarisonic MIA for over a year. Unfortunately, the device started to malfunction. I did not want to re-purchase it and spend a crazy amount of money, again. So I decided to try out the lemon sonic system by Xnovi. I love it thus far. It is a sleek design and super lightweight. Works the same way as clarisonic, but with more settings. You can set it for high or low speed, with already timed intervals for 20 secs on forehead, 20 on chin, and 10 sec on each cheek. If you want to clean your face for a longer time you can do up to 2 minutes. Overall, I love this system and would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a leg and arm on a clarisonic system. Oh did I mention it comes with two brush heads!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m giving it five stars. I got it three days ago, used it twice because I&#x27;ve been showering at night recently.  My skin already  looks more vibrant! It&#x27;s pretty easy to use and being a mellenial, I don&#x27;t mind the fact that it has no instructions because who reads them anyway, lol?!  Just three speed settings and a wireless charger, pretty idiot proof to figure out, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I got the pink one, which I was really stoked about, but wasn&#x27;t expecting...  All in all, very happy that I went with this instead of the clarisonic.  There is measurably no difference between the two from playing around with my friend&#x27;s one.  Will give an update if anything changes my mind, but I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Wrong color sent. Wrong color charger sent with it. Finally, wrong color brushes along with that. The brush just vibrates vs moving and the bristles aren&#x27;t as firm as the higher end ones. This thing is no where as good as the better brushes&lt;br /&gt; Save your money.</li>
    <li> Loved this cleansing brush but, unfortunately, only got to use it about six times before it quit working.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s great and it works good for it&#x27;s prize. I guess my facial wash is the problem and not the xnovi but could also be that it&#x27;s to harsh for my skin. My face is kind of sensitive but I can not complain really about the xnovo. Like how it charges. So high tech with that magnet on it.</li>
    <li> bought one for my younger sister as a gift and shel also loved it!  would highly recommend anyone regardless of age.</li>
    <li> I used to have the clarisonic for a few years and when it broke, I shopped around for a more affordable alternative. I find the Lemon Sonic not only equal but even better than the clairisonic brand. It seems to have better brushes and I finally DO feel a difference. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The Lemon Sonic Skin cleansing system comes beautifully packaged with all parts in their own boxes within the main box.  The instructions state that it must charge for 18 hours before first use, which I did, so don&#x27;t expect to be able to use it upon arrival.  It comes with 2 main brushes, 1 with harder bristles and 1 with softer bristles. The handle is ergonomic and comfortable to hold.  It vibrates for a set of programmed seconds, pausing slightly so you know when to switch to cleaning a different part of your face.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Mine was defective.  The Lemon Sonic (LS) fully charged after receipt and I was able to use it for a week (this equals roughly 14 minutes of use).  The battery indicator light remained white and the product never beeped indicating a charge was needed.  One morning I switched it on and it switched off immediately.  So I fully charged it a second time.  According to the directions the item is fully charged when the white indicator light is solid and not blinking.  After the charge I was able to use it 3 times (total of 6 minutes) before the same &amp;#34;dying&amp;#34; process happened.  Again, no beeping or red light blinking telling me that it needed charged.  Thinking I must be doing something wrong, I charged the LS for another 18 hours hoping that it was user error.  Nope, I used it again for 5 days (roughly 10 minutes of use) before it died again.  I&#x27;m returning for a refund and purchasing a sonic system that relies on batteries.</li>
