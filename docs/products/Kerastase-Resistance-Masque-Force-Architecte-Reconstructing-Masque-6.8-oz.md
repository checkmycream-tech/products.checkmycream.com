      <li>Love it, worth the investment!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel like original product, and it is also does&#x27;t help anything to my hair, before I have received the same masque and it works very good</li>
      <li>What I received was equivalent to a cheap drugstore conditioner that was watery in texture.  </li>
      <li>, it is soo smooth</li>
      <li>Makes my platinum hair silky smooth.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Turns damaged and breaking hair into silk and smooth one.</li>
      <li>Lightly heat a 1/2 cup olive oil, massage into hair, wrap head in Saran Wrap for 15 minutes...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and after receiving this particular item, I&#x27;m quite sure it is counterfeit.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing special</li>
      <li>I never used the full jar.  </li>
      <li>I bought this on the recommendation of a friend, and was truly surprised at how effectively it worked.</li>
      <li>the product arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
      <li>It was a very good price, but didn&#x27;t live up to the other Kerastase products I had purchased from my stylist.  </li>
      <li>but it was totally worth it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this conditioner, I love the feel of my wet hair after I have used it</li>
      <li>so when I first bought it at my salon</li>
      <li>I kind of expected fireworks the way my salon was raving about this product.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and kind of dull (lacks shininess).</li>
      <li>and it makes your hair super soft.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference between this and a much cheaper deep conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Thank you, I use this product for damaged hair and it really works well on bleach and damaged hair, as a treatment.</li>
      <li>I ordered the conditioner from another company and it was not the real product.</li>
      <li>The one from Kerastase is much thicker.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for this product.  </li>
      <li>The product was very watery and some portions were clumped together.</li>
      <li>and I really could feel my hair smoother and hydrated.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to spend so much</li>
      <li>I tried the others too, even that golden and expensive one, but this one is definitely the best.</li>
      <li>Controls stubborn split ends &amp; leaves hair soft &amp; shiny!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also super tiny jar</li>
      <li>This stuff made my damaged hair feel strong while it was still wet and extremely smooth once it was dry!</li>
      <li>I dont own any other product that works quite like it and will therefor be definitely purchasing again once I run out!</li>
      <li>fine hair and does not weigh it down too much.</li>
      <li>My hair ends are now smooth and soft, instead of dry and brittle.</li>
      <li>The next day my hair is smooth, shiny, and doesn&#x27;t require much from the flat iron.</li>
      <li>Really small for price .. Didn&#x27;t seem all that helpful like I heard it would be but its better than a store bought consructor</li>
      <li>Since I still have 2/3 of the original jar left, I can say unequivocally -- this is not the same product.  </li>
      <li>the hair near your scalp is the least damaged to save the product for the parts that need it most.  </li>
      <li>It really worked and helped restore my hair back to health after repeated usagage.  </li>
      <li>I ordered Kenastase Masque and Shampoo from the same company and it was the real deal.</li>
      <li>Do not put this on near the roots because A. you will not get any benefit from it and B.</li>
      <li>I wash it daily with a Kerastase Ban Satin Chroma shampoo for colored hair, but the conditioner/mask that comes in that line leaves much to be desired.</li>
      <li>if the reason is using it with wet hands (as in the shower or right after shampooing)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled I don&#x27;t have to cut off the ends, and think this product is well worth the price, even though it seems very expensive.</li>
      <li>For anyone who needs that extra pick me up for their hair, I highly recommend Kerastase.  </li>
      <li>The wording on the back was mostly in some asian language, as opposed to other Kerastase products I&#x27;ve used which have multiple language translations.</li>
      <li>Saw major improvement after 3-4 uses already.</li>
      <li>On a whim, I ordered a jar direct from Kerastase and both the smell and consistency are completely different.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very thick and gets oily very quickly.</li>
      <li>I have not used much of it since I only use it once a week, but my hair does seem to be breaking less.</li>

<li> Lastly, after just a week of having it in the bathroom, a black mold began to grow under the lid, which I&#x27;ve never seen a product do before.</li>
<li> Be careful which buyer you invest your $ with.</li>
<li> Received it on time and product was as expected.</li>
<li> Absolutely no question.  </li>
<li> I used it 6 times and its empty</li>
<li> hair ends were quite damaged from over-dying, and I really thought I&#x27;d just have to cut a few inches off my hair and regrow, but I put this on my hair, left it in for about 30 minutes, and the results were quite dramatic.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or leave it feeling too dry.</li>
<li> this one just left my hair feeling dry and dull.</li>
<li> Works if used with the shampoo from this series or with other shampoo brands.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best masque ever !!!</li>
    <li> Be warned that I received a fake product!  I kept the product only because I was on vacation and needed something for my hair.  What I received was equivalent to a cheap drugstore conditioner that was watery in texture.  I tried to save some money since my salon charges $65 for this product, but I ended up wasting $41 instead.</li>
    <li> Makes my platinum hair silky smooth. Love this product. Have mostly replaced my conditioner with this mask. This is the third tub I have been through.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a friend, and was truly surprised at how effectively it worked. After reading other reviews, I decided to buy the one sold by Amazon, rather than some of the others which may have been slightly less expensive, but coming from a provider I didn&#x27;t know (one review said the product they received was not the same as what they bought in a salon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair ends were quite damaged from over-dying, and I really thought I&#x27;d just have to cut a few inches off my hair and regrow, but I put this on my hair, left it in for about 30 minutes, and the results were quite dramatic. My hair ends are now smooth and soft, instead of dry and brittle. I&#x27;m thrilled I don&#x27;t have to cut off the ends, and think this product is well worth the price, even though it seems very expensive. If your hair is damaged and you don&#x27;t want to cut it all off, give this a try!</li>
    <li> Brings tired, heat damaged, color treated hair back to life. My hair is very thick and gets oily very quickly. I wash it daily with a Kerastase Ban Satin Chroma shampoo for colored hair, but the conditioner/mask that comes in that line leaves much to be desired. The conditioner is too watery and the mask leaves the hair heavy. This mask however is amazing. It leaves no residue, and you can feel the difference in hair texture the second you begin to rinse it out.  I use a tiny bit of this instead of conditioner when I apply it mid way down to the ends. Do not put this on near the roots because A. you will not get any benefit from it and B. the hair near your scalp is the least damaged to save the product for the parts that need it most.  My hair remains silky even after I blow dry it and use a flat iron. It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or leave it feeling too dry. Plus the scent is very mild and very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Didnt do the job. Didn&#x27;t do what is advertised. Wood not recommend for my skin. Was not happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Does NOTHING! Lightly heat a 1/2 cup olive oil, massage into hair, wrap head in Saran Wrap for 15 minutes...Shampoo thoroughly...Voila..saved money and you have &#x27;Movie Star&#x27; hair.</li>
    <li> always love this conditioner! can&#x27;t beat it! I will continue to order every time i am out. This stuff gives hair a completely different texture.</li>
    <li> This stuff made my damaged hair feel strong while it was still wet and extremely smooth once it was dry! I dont own any other product that works quite like it and will therefor be definitely purchasing again once I run out!</li>
    <li> This is the best. Has saved my bleached hair for many years.</li>
    <li> Good  product.  I used to use it and  this is the second time  to  purchase.  The delivery is  good. Will  keep  using this  brand.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> love it.&lt;br /&gt;makes ur hair much better. my hair is actually growing now ! im really happy, it is soo smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Great for color treated hair. I was hesitant to spend so much but it was totally worth it. Saw major improvement after 3-4 uses already. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I tried the others too, even that golden and expensive one, but this one is definitely the best. My hair feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I use it once a week as a deep conditioner. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product if you want to take good care of your hair.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price. I&#x27;m 100% sure this is fake! My Hair was still damaged. Should had just bought it from the store. Be careful which buyer you invest your $ with. What a waste!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair after using this.  I even left it in my hair for awhile before rinsing it.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Turns damaged and breaking hair into silk and smooth one. Works if used with the shampoo from this series or with other shampoo brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it once a week and I really could feel my hair smoother and hydrated. I often add some oil in it to increse it&#x27;s power of restoration.</li>
    <li> Product not as hydrating as I hoped.</li>
    <li> Received it on time and product was as expected.</li>
    <li> Best hair masque I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
    <li> I like it. I would buy again. Shipped fast.&lt;br /&gt;Have fine hair and does not weigh it down too much.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I ordered this product in November and discovered too late to return it.  It was a very good price, but didn&#x27;t live up to the other Kerastase products I had purchased from my stylist.  I never used the full jar.  Recently I checked out the same product at the salon, and noticed a difference in texture.  On a whim, I ordered a jar direct from Kerastase and both the smell and consistency are completely different.  Since I still have 2/3 of the original jar left, I can say unequivocally -- this is not the same product.  Absolutely no question.  The one from Kerastase is much thicker.</li>
    <li> i love the keratase products. this one just left my hair feeling dry and dull. the product arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
    <li> Love it, good for very damage hair.</li>
    <li> I used a product that my friend recommended and it totally fried my hair!  My hairdresser told me to use Kerastase Force Architecte Masque.  It really worked and helped restore my hair back to health after repeated usagage.  It&#x27;s expensive which is why I gave it a 4 star rating but it works.</li>
    <li> The Karastase Bain Force Atchitecte  product actually does what it says it does. Hair appears Healthier and Stronger! Love it, worth the investment!</li>
    <li> this is amazing, really good for your hair. leave it in for 3 hours and it makes your hair super soft. but it is too expensive - can&#x27;t buy it too often.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. It works great. I ordered Kenastase Masque and Shampoo from the same company and it was the real deal. I ordered the conditioner from another company and it was not the real product. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Really small for price .. Didn&#x27;t seem all that helpful like I heard it would be but its better than a store bought consructor</li>
    <li> This product not only helps against heat, but has brought back shine and softness to my hair.  From here on, I will use else but Keratase products.</li>
    <li> This conditioner isn&#x27;t very thick so when I first bought it at my salon I was skeptical. I absolutely love it. My hair is fine and kind of dull (lacks shininess). I use this and actually sleep with my hair wet. The next day my hair is smooth, shiny, and doesn&#x27;t require much from the flat iron.</li>
    <li> I think it is fake. Kerarstase is wonderfull, and thisw masque doesn´t work.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel that this product alone gave my hair enough moisture so I mix it with the Keratase Elixr Ultime. I have not used much of it since I only use it once a week, but my hair does seem to be breaking less.</li>
    <li> Thank you, I use this product for damaged hair and it really works well on bleach and damaged hair, as a treatment.</li>
    <li> Meh.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference between this and a much cheaper deep conditioner.  I kind of expected fireworks the way my salon was raving about this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and after receiving this particular item, I&#x27;m quite sure it is counterfeit. The product was very watery and some portions were clumped together. The wording on the back was mostly in some asian language, as opposed to other Kerastase products I&#x27;ve used which have multiple language translations. Lastly, after just a week of having it in the bathroom, a black mold began to grow under the lid, which I&#x27;ve never seen a product do before.</li>
    <li> Love the product but not sure what happened with this bottle - doesn&#x27;t work 1/2 as well or feel as thick as the last bottle I bought from the salon.</li>
    <li> For anyone who needs that extra pick me up for their hair, I highly recommend Kerastase.  The products are pricey, but the results are amazing.  I apply the masque to my hair, tie it up in a bun, and then wrap it up in a plastic bag.  Leave it on for 30 minutes, and rinse.  It leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth.  Living in the desert, this is a necessity for my hair routine to defend my hair against the dry heat.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this conditioner, I love the feel of my wet hair after I have used it BUT I don&#x27;t see a big difference in my hair when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I don&#x27;t think I would pay the price for this again.</li>
    <li> It does make my hair soft, but it doesn&#x27;t feel any softer or less damaged than when I use any other masque or product for damaged hair that I&#x27;ve purchased at Ulta.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Once per week repairs your hair.</li>
    <li> Not happy with these product , I always used kerastase, they all smell about the same but this one smells different and now I have dandruff .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nothing special It&#x27;s an expensive product and it&#x27;s not good I don&#x27;t have any good feelings while using it My hair is in a bad condition after this mask It&#x27;s also super tiny jar I used it 6 times and its empty</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for this product.  I found that it made my hair look like wire.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s made for hair strands that are thin and brittle, though.</li>
    <li> in the beginning I loved this product....but I agree with some of the other reviews....it is very expensive and very watery.  I know from ordering it at other times that it is not supposed to be a lotion.  It&#x27;s awkward to use.  if the reason is using it with wet hands (as in the shower or right after shampooing)...it should be packaged differently.  I have given it more than one period of grace and probably will not re-order.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like original product, and it is also does&#x27;t help anything to my hair, before I have received the same masque and it works very good</li>
    <li> Great Product!!! Controls stubborn split ends &amp; leaves hair soft &amp; shiny!!! Will continue to use it forever :) Love it!!</li>
