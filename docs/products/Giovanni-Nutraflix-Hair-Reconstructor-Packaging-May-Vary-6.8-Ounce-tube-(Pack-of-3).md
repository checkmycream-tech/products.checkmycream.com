      <li>While this does get the job done it didnt prove to be more effective than the hair mayo which i feel gives deeper conditioning.</li>
      <li>This deep condish is the best for my hair.</li>
      <li>What can I say I just love this stuff</li>
      <li>and I love them all.</li>
      <li>I was so glad you have it here for me</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore and just love it .....</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nutrafix for about six months, and love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does a wonderful job as a conditioner when left in for the recommended 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>I love the creamy consistency of this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff</li>
      <li>Another product I love is the Tea Tree triple Treat shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>but if you are happy with what you are currently using there is no need to switch to this.</li>
      <li>I have waist length hair and it is a challenge to keep it looking smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>It works great, especially as a deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>It is good as far as conditioning but in my opinion i think the hair</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it again after my original tube ran out</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or smell like anything strong, just does a great job.</li>
      <li>Good deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t leave it on for the full 10 minutes.  </li>
      <li>my hair shiny, and super, super soft!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>As my title states, I did indeed see results after using this product for the very first time.&lt;br /&gt;Feels</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
      <li>I followed it with a conditioner and then straightened my hair (which I do rarely</li>
      <li>My hair is hennaed though and not chemically dyed, which means it acts more like virgin hair as in it isn&#x27;t super dry.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick and has great slip.  </li>
      <li>very satisfied with this product, and all the organic hair products that I have tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;I will never go back to using commercial products that fill my hair and skin with harmful chemicals, and leave a residue.</li>
      <li>I am really feeling the Giovanni Line.....</li>
      <li>My Hair has so much body...</li>
      <li>I had bought a tube of this on sale at a retail store (kind of a random item for them) and fell in love with the just-right amount of conditioning it provides for my hair.</li>
      <li>so I was thrilled to buy a 3 pack here for far less than my bargain tube.</li>
      <li>Very natural and not tested on animals!</li>
      <li>I have honestly never really been able to run my fingers through straightened hair, but I actually can now.</li>
      <li>Made my hair very soft.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy using this conditioner because it conditions without weighing hair down and does not strip the color from my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine, 2C wavy hair, and have been using protein treatments on it every few weeks or so for the last two years.  </li>
      <li>I also use the Direct Leave-in Weightless Moisture Conditioner.</li>
      <li>mayonaise/cholestrol is better for deep condition for african american hair especially relaxed hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and I can feel the moisture.</li>
      <li>Yes my hair was soft and silky.  </li>
      <li>because when I do my hair looks fried)it was SO soft and silky and shiny...</li>
      <li>The combo of the two leaves my waves soft and curly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use heat on my hair very often at all, but my hair still felt brittle, dry and knotty much of the time (I have curly Middle Eastern hair).</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft even though I have dry and very frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>This product makes my 4b-4c natural hair texture instantly feel soft and moist ..</li>
      <li>It is not too thick and is easy to distribute throughout your hair.  </li>
      <li>Using protein really seals in the rough spots in my hair, and makes it softer and wavier.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Sometimes I use this just for a few minutes in the shower on its own, but usually I apply it and then sit under a dryer for about fifteen minutes with it in.  </li>
      <li>I like the Giovanni natural products because they work well to improve the moisture and condition of curl, natural, and/or dry hair.</li>
      <li>For African Americans, i would only recommend this product if only you wanted to go with natural products</li>
      <li>if your hair  doesn&#x27;t need protein or if after use protein you don&#x27;t do a deep conditioning your hair will certainly get dry, sometimes the hair is in bad shape not because need protein, but because needs moisturizer and some  kind of protein works fine for a type of hair, but  it doesn&#x27;t mean  will work for everybody</li>
      <li>I lightly dampened my dry \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; (i.e. not recently shampooed) hair with some water and liberally applied NutraFix to small sections of hair, one at a time.</li>

<li> And my hair color from the previous week - gone.  </li>
<li> This is thick and nourishing.</li>
<li> felt like I was using a very expensive product, but I only paid like 7 bucks for it.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>

<li> I was shocked and in disbelief.</li>
<li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this yet please do cause you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <li> Excellent product, I love giovanni. This is thick and nourishing. I have thick curly and this isn&#x27;t too heavy or too whimpy, it&#x27;s just right!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use heat on my hair very often at all, but my hair still felt brittle, dry and knotty much of the time (I have curly Middle Eastern hair). After being advised to use a leave-in conditioner with protein in it, I did some research and decided to try this product. I lightly dampened my dry \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; (i.e. not recently shampooed) hair with some water and liberally applied NutraFix to small sections of hair, one at a time. I left it on for about 35 minutes without a shower cap -- it did not drip because it&#x27;s such a thick and creamy consistency, and my hair wasn&#x27;t wet to begin with. Yes, parts of my hair did feel crunchy by the end of it, but once I shampooed and rinsed out my hair it disappeared. I followed it with a conditioner and then straightened my hair (which I do rarely because when I do my hair looks fried)it was SO soft and silky and shiny...I was so satisfied! I have honestly never really been able to run my fingers through straightened hair, but I actually can now. I&#x27;m not sure how often you should be using a leave-in conditioner, but the next time I use this one I think I might add some vegetable glycerine to it because I&#x27;ve read that it gives ones hair an extra sheen.   Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> Good deep conditioner. I like the Giovanni natural products because they work well to improve the moisture and condition of curl, natural, and/or dry hair.</li>
    <li> As my title states, I did indeed see results after using this product for the very first time.&lt;br /&gt;Feels so luscious when applied throughout your hair, and has a pleasant, light scent.&lt;br /&gt;Made my hair shiny, and super, super soft!&lt;br /&gt;I felt like I was using a very expensive product, but I only paid like 7 bucks for it.&lt;br /&gt;Im very satisfied with this product, and all the organic hair products that I have tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;I will never go back to using commercial products that fill my hair and skin with harmful chemicals, and leave a residue.</li>
    <li> this product like all of the other giovanni products i&#x27;ve tried dried my natural ( unrelaxed) african american hair. will return to looking for products for african americans by african american owned companies</li>
    <li> Amazing ! This product makes my 4b-4c natural hair texture instantly feel soft and moist .. I was shocked and in disbelief. I use lots of Giovanni hair products anyway so I&#x27;m not sure why I was in such shock, cause I adore the products 9 times out of 10 anyway. If you haven&#x27;t tried this yet please do cause you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Also the ingredients are great !!</li>
    <li> I am African- American.....and this stuff is great. My hair is so soft and I can feel the moisture. I also use the Direct Leave-in Weightless Moisture Conditioner. Another product I love is the Tea Tree triple Treat shampoo and conditioner. I use the Giovanni products in conjunction with different oils. My Hair has so much body...LOVE-IT!!!!!    I am really feeling the Giovanni Line.....</li>
    <li> I am a Brazilian African  and I love this product, as all Giovanni productss that I use it alwasy work great for me. For those compmplaining that  their hair get dry with it, remember it has \\&quot;protein\\&quot; if your hair  doesn&#x27;t need protein or if after use protein you don&#x27;t do a deep conditioning your hair will certainly get dry, sometimes the hair is in bad shape not because need protein, but because needs moisturizer and some  kind of protein works fine for a type of hair, but  it doesn&#x27;t mean  will work for everybody, people&#x27;s hair are different and has different needs.  Thaks Giovanni to great organic product and in a price  that everybody can get...    Sissabrasil</li>
    <li> Love this product. It works great, especially as a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, works well, and leaves my hair in wonderful condition.  I use Nutrafixx for washing my hair, instead of shampoo, and I get comments all the time on how beautiful my hair looks.  My hairdresser (who knows that I color my hair) marvels at my hair&#x27;s texture every single time I go in.</li>
    <li> Yes my hair was soft and silky.  And my hair color from the previous week - gone.  Thank God I didn&#x27;t leave it on for the full 10 minutes.  I left it on for about 5... Smelled great, feels rich when applying but sadly, this is not for me.  I like their body wash and body lotion, but cannot use this product again.</li>
    <li> I love Giovanni products and thus I buy in bulk!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this conditioner because it conditions without weighing hair down and does not strip the color from my hair.  It also doesn&#x27;t have added fragrance chemicals which irritate me.</li>
    <li> I prefer using nautral products for my hair and decided to try this brand. It is good as far as conditioning but in my opinion i think the hair mayonaise/cholestrol is better for deep condition for african american hair especially relaxed hair. While this does get the job done it didnt prove to be more effective than the hair mayo which i feel gives deeper conditioning. For African Americans, i would only recommend this product if only you wanted to go with natural products but if you are happy with what you are currently using there is no need to switch to this.</li>
    <li> This conditioner was recommended to us by a relative.  I love the creamy consistency of this product.  It is not too thick and is easy to distribute throughout your hair.  It does a wonderful job as a conditioner when left in for the recommended 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore and just love it .....I was so glad you have it here for me</li>
    <li> I had bought a tube of this on sale at a retail store (kind of a random item for them) and fell in love with the just-right amount of conditioning it provides for my hair. Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or smell like anything strong, just does a great job. I couldn&#x27;t find it again after my original tube ran out so I was thrilled to buy a 3 pack here for far less than my bargain tube. I have waist length hair and it is a challenge to keep it looking smooth and shiny. This \\&quot;reconstructor\\&quot; is great!</li>
    <li> What can I say I just love this stuff the Whole Giovanni hair line is awesome it helps with the PH of the hair the moisture of the hair everything.love it</li>
    <li> I use this after swimming, after using a chlorine shampoo.  Works great for me.  My hair is hennaed though and not chemically dyed, which means it acts more like virgin hair as in it isn&#x27;t super dry.  This stuff feels like I&#x27;m smearing liquid saran wrap in my hair and rinses out well.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It makes my hair so soft even though I have dry and very frizzy hair. Very natural and not tested on animals!</li>
    <li> This deep condish is the best for my hair. It&#x27;s thick and has great slip.  I use this once a week, hence buying in bulk.  This product allows my hair to return to its natural state (3b/3c in nape area) after a few weeks from heat, flat iron damage.  I love this stuff and I consider this a staple product.  Wish I could give ten stars.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, 2C wavy hair, and have been using protein treatments on it every few weeks or so for the last two years.  Using protein really seals in the rough spots in my hair, and makes it softer and wavier.  I&#x27;d been buying higher-end products (by Curl Junkie and Spiral Solutions), but decided to give this a try when my last Curl Junkie product ran out.  I&#x27;ve been using Nutrafix for about six months, and love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I use this just for a few minutes in the shower on its own, but usually I apply it and then sit under a dryer for about fifteen minutes with it in.  After that, I rinse it out, and apply a deep conditioner for about twenty minutes.  The combo of the two leaves my waves soft and curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also Curly-Girl-friendly for those following a no-silicone, no-sulfate hair routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that this is just as good as higher-end products!</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner!  Made my hair very soft.  After trying this I bought meant of the other Giovanni Eco Chic products and I love them all.</li>
