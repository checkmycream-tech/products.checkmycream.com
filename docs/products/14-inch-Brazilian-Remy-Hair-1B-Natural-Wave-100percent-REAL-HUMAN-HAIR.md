      <li>If you are looking for a really full look get 4 packs</li>
      <li>I would suggest three packs for full sew in.</li>
      <li>This was not 14inch hair , it tangled &amp; matted up quick</li>
      <li>I assumed that this would be tangle free just as the supplier said and of course after the first wash it was a disaster.</li>
      <li>This hair is well worth it</li>
      <li>for the price I paid for this hair it was worth the buy.</li>
      <li>The hair has mininmal shedding  feels very real</li>
      <li>I could have bought better hair from the hair store and for the same price.</li>
      <li>Hair looks pretty.</li>

      <li>wand curled it and after I washed it it returned back to it&#x27;s original wave pattern and still was minimum shedding and no tangling!  </li>
      <li>The hair was super soft and minimum shedding before I installed it.  </li>
      <li>First of all, I was sent 2 packs of 16in hair, when I particularly ordered the 14in.</li>

      <li>Can&#x27;t determine if its good or not good.</li>
      <li>It was beautiful upon first installing but after my first wash, the hair shed, tangled, and matted badly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still gonna keep using eliza wigs as my connection they give u REAL not fake human hair and don&#x27;t charge u up the ass.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m a stylist and use professional products.</li>
      <li>After i was done washing and conditioning it, it kept its natural wave, luster, and bounce.</li>
      <li>Hi&lt;br /&gt;After months of searching for real remy hair ,I have finally got one.</li>
      <li>i didnt experience much shedding or tangling till months months later like 6 months later when it gotten very old and my new growth hair was rejecting it.  </li>

<li> I ordered 14 inch Brazilian Remy Hair #1B Natural Wave 100% REAL HUMAN HAIR</li>
<li> Ordered only one at first for partial sew in, but needed two.</li>
<li> It was thick and full.</li>
<li> Feels so soft and natural  looking even when using very little product matter of fact</li>
<li> my hairstylist didnt like it too much because when she does a touch up she usually like doing extra</li>
<li> The only complaint I have about this hair is that it has been dyed because when I washed it the water was brown and my other complaint is every time I go back to order some more hair</li>
<li> This hair CANNOT possibly be &amp;#34;100% REAL HUMAN HAIR&amp;#34; due to the fact that it MELTED while I was flat ironing it.</li>
<li> *** :) but not to bad enough that u can&#x27;t wear it.</li>
<li> The hair was really dry and falling apart.</li>
<li> this is not real Brazilian hair</li>
<li> The hair want what I expected.</li>
<li> con is that the seller crunched my friggen hair into this little tiny packing and when i got it&lt;br /&gt;it was in half .</li>
<li> Sadly, it wasn&#x27;t it tangled matted and shed within the first 2 weeks of me having it.</li>
<li> she says it comes out easier than other hair she has tried.</li>
<li> The hair is real human hair .i could not believe it as I have spent so much money in the past and they were all fake.</li>
<li> Not worth it for my money.</li>
<li> the water did not turn black.</li>
<li> The hair on the other hand, a tangly, matted mess after washed!</li>
<li> just stiff less movement.</li>
<li> After the hair dried it had 1 or 2 strands of hair but considering the fact that ALL hair will shed its not a problem</li>
<li> A waste of my hard earn money</li>
<li> Really did not like just hate it.</li>
<li> /&gt;Worst company i&#x27;ve dealt with as far as purchasing hair.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible &amp;#62;:(</li>
<li> No good</li>
<li> Looked very dull and tangled all the time.</li>

    <li> will b ordering more!! i look so amazing with it an it also works very good like my own hair</li>
    <li> This hair is really good. beautiful. looks like your own hair. Except just like someone else&#x27;s said after u wash it. it gos to s*** :) but not to bad enough that u can&#x27;t wear it. just stiff less movement. I&#x27;m still gonna keep using eliza wigs as my connection they give u REAL not fake human hair and don&#x27;t charge u up the ass. ;)</li>
    <li> 14 inch Brazilian Remy Hair...&lt;br /&gt;PRISTINE HAIR.  The hair wash well, sheds, pass the burn test, thin but the buddles are 100g, has a nice wave pattern. Would by a again if I was on a budget .</li>
    <li> I ordered 14 inch Brazilian Remy Hair #1B Natural Wave 100% REAL HUMAN HAIR and I really like this product.</li>
    <li> This hair was thin. I didn&#x27;t like it at all. I never wore it because it was so thin. No good</li>
    <li> I must say I was kind of hesitant on ordering this hair because of other reviews but I was like what the heck the hair is only $11 a bundle what can I lose and so I purchased 2 bundles which were just enough for me.  The hair came in earlier than the estimated date and it was packaged well.  The hair was super soft and minimum shedding before I installed it.  It has been about a month and I have straighten it, wand curled it and after I washed it it returned back to it&#x27;s original wave pattern and still was minimum shedding and no tangling!  The only complaint I have about this hair is that it has been dyed because when I washed it the water was brown and my other complaint is every time I go back to order some more hair the price goes up.  I ordered 2 more bundles at 14.99 a bundle but I&#x27;m still skeptical about it because of my horrible experience with Ali Express.  This hair is well worth it and I don&#x27;t regret ordering this.  I highly recommend this to everyone on a budget! (I AM WEARING THE HAIR IN THE PICTURE)!</li>
    <li> Bought this hair for my fiancee and she loves it. Even thought the tropical weather causes some tangling she says it comes out easier than other hair she has tried. She rated it a 4.5/5 stars. There&#x27;s no 4.5 so I chose 4. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. Would definitely buy again and would also recommend highly to others.</li>
    <li> No idea what the deal is with this hair. Can&#x27;t determine if its good or not good. These reviews are ALL OVER THE PLACE! ??? no idea.</li>
    <li> The hair on the other hand, a tangly, matted mess after washed! It was beautiful upon first installing but after my first wash, the hair shed, tangled, and matted badly. I would not recommend getting this hair. It also did not return to its original wave after washing and straightening.</li>
    <li> this was the worse hair i have ever bought. I could have bought better hair from the hair store and for the same price.</li>
    <li> The hair was originally suppose to be delivered Feb 15 - March 6 but it actually came Jan 26. i placed the order Jan 22nd so it was excellent shipping. The hair didnt shed that much straight out the package maybe 2 strands but it did SHED when i washed it. However it kept the color 1b the water did not turn black. After i was done washing and conditioning it, it kept its natural wave, luster, and bounce. So far i am VERY happy with this hair for the low price of $37. After washing the hair it didnt shed at all. After the hair dried it had 1 or 2 strands of hair but considering the fact that ALL hair will shed its not a problem i would recommend this hair.</li>
    <li> I assumed that this would be tangle free just as the supplier said and of course after the first wash it was a disaster. Looked very dull and tangled all the time. Terrible investment</li>
    <li> This hair was great! It dyes easily and it feels great. It was thick and full. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> i love this hair when it gotten installed in my hair last year i liked how i washed it it returned to normal while drying on it&#x27;s own,so easy to curl and straighten. Feels so soft and natural  looking even when using very little product matter of fact my hairstylist didnt like it too much because when she does a touch up she usually like doing extra and she couldnt do anything like curl it cause it curled on its own (LOL she got over it eventually) i didnt experience much shedding or tangling till months months later like 6 months later when it gotten very old and my new growth hair was rejecting it.  i didnt try dying it yet because i was in love with how natural it looked and worked with me maybe next time hopefully when i order again i have the same satisfaction again :).</li>
    <li> This was not 14inch hair , it tangled &amp; matted up quick this is not real Brazilian hair I&#x27;m never ordering from this again</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE WAY IT FEELS ND LOOK BUT IT SHREADS ALOT.. I WOULD REALLY RECOMEND IT TO MY FRIENDS.</li>
    <li> I normally dnt do review but here&#x27;s my take on the hair....I ordered 2 bundles of 14 inch body wavy overall its an ok weft I should have gotten 3 for a sew in but I made my two work by gluing them in.The hair has mininmal shedding  feels very real and u can do many things with it without losing its original curl..... Would I purchase it again YES!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not Brazilian Remy but it&#x27;s ok its serving its purpose.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 14inch Brazilian hair 100% real hair. for the price I paid for this hair it was worth the buy. I will purchase this hair again, for the price I paid I will recommend to friends</li>
    <li> Very good product. Excellent quality. Will purchase again. Meets expectation. What are you waiting on? Go ahead and purchase. It feels like human hair...</li>
    <li> The seller was excellent, hair was not. Tangled really bad when washed. I&#x27;m a stylist and use professional products. Even did a deep condition. Had to cut it short to eliminate that happening. Tried to upload photo, couldn&#x27;t sorry.</li>
    <li> Love, the remy hair, it great, can reuse it over and over, if taken care of. Does not matte up or shed, the product is very good.</li>
    <li> The hair is not and cannot be 100% human hair! I tried curling it! Instead of making a perfect curl it left a nasty burnt smell!  Be cheap but please keep quality in mind ! You give amazon a  very bad name! It is unfortunate!</li>
    <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;After months of searching for real remy hair ,I have finally got one. I bought this hair from Foxy hair and the delivery was so fast. The hair is real human hair .i could not believe it as I have spent so much money in the past and they were all fake. It Is very  soft and does not fall of when you comb it. I will definitely by again from this seller.</li>
    <li> The hair was really dry and falling apart. The shedding was more than a dog shed. Really did not like just hate it. Not worth it for my money. Don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who will paying that much money.</li>
    <li> Hair looks pretty. .but shedding and tangled was awful ..each time I combed my hair the floor looked like someone had cut their hair</li>
    <li> The hair inside the bag looks good but when you pull it out it doesn&#x27;t stand up to its name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;another con is that the seller crunched my friggen hair into this little tiny packing and when i got it&lt;br /&gt;it was in half . Unprofessional!!!&lt;br /&gt;i couldn&#x27;t even test the hair because it looked like some one already have their was a piece cut and already looking as if it had been through the ringer. They leave a note in the package that says junk and it also looks like crap. they leave a email and a number but either of them answer their emails or calls. I am trying to get a refund but it says i have to pay for the shipping.&lt;br /&gt;WHAT!!! i don&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst company i&#x27;ve dealt with as far as purchasing hair.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible &amp;#62;:(</li>
    <li> It was horrible dont buy it ! i actually don&#x27;t think this is human hair . I guess you can say you get what you pay for .</li>
    <li> I thought this hair was going to be great and lovely, nice and flowing. Sadly, it wasn&#x27;t it tangled matted and shed within the first 2 weeks of me having it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the hair from Pristine Hair because it was through Amazon (safer), in Florida and I knew I would be able to get it delivered next day. First of all, I was sent 2 packs of 16in hair, when I particularly ordered the 14in. I needed the hair for an event and decided not to return it. The hair was good for about a week until I washed it. Very tangled, dry, and brittle...and I use very good products and take care of hair. This hair CANNOT possibly be &amp;#34;100% REAL HUMAN HAIR&amp;#34; due to the fact that it MELTED while I was flat ironing it. I should&#x27;ve did a burn test before I installed it. Nevertheless, I am extremely disappointed. PRobably my worst amazon purchased to date.</li>
    <li> Horrible hair tangles and knots not buying again. It only lasted a month and that is with taking care of the hair.</li>
    <li> My order came in on the date it was promised and was packaged very professional. I have not installed my hair but so far it seems to be a very nice quality . Also they included hair string and two weft clips. I cant wait to install my hair!!!!!</li>
    <li> Ordered only one at first for partial sew in, but needed two. I would suggest three packs for full sew in.</li>
    <li> Poor quality hair did not retain body wave, hair was thin and looked like scraps of hair sewn on a track</li>
    <li> The worst hair every.  Brazilian my a**. I would not recommend it to anyone.  A waste of my hard earn money</li>
    <li> I purchased my hair from Pristine Hair on amazon. I have had it installed for about a month now and I totally love it. The curls last, when u wash it returns to its natural state and there is min shedding and I have not sealed my wefts. If you are looking for a really full look get 4 packs</li>
    <li> The hair want what I expected. As for service.. this is week three Ive been waiting for my resend still.</li>
    <li> i am so loving your hair, its doesnt tangle, and it feels great.. glad you decided to be an amazon seller</li>
</ol>
