    <li> Love this stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
    <li> My friend cannot live without this for conditioning her hair after she washes it every day.  Makes dry hair soft and managable.</li>
    <li> I have to use a leave in every day or else my hair is just terrible.  Years of color changing has finally taken a toll.  I was recently given this as a sample at my local hair salon and instantly fell in love.  I had to purchase this prior to heading to the beach for vacation knowing how harsh the sun and salty air could be.  I was happy to see my hair stay soft and silky the entire two weeks.  All of the other leave ins that are in my closet have been pushed to the back.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This product is actually moisturizing without making your hair looking all greasy. Love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Works on my hair great.  Makes it feel thicker and more full.&lt;br /&gt;The ends don&#x27;t dry out as fast as usual.</li>
    <li> Spray this on and curls are easy to comb.  It also makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
    <li> The worst product I have ever used on my hair. It actually made it feel more dry than using nothing. There is no smell whatsoever.. Maybe they sent me water.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and the product was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The moisture hydration cure is helping my hair which is exposed to chlorine.  I spray my damp hair before I style it.  My hair feels softer.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my hair super soft. I love how it feels.</li>
    <li> this is a hair product I cannot be without!! prompt shipment, and good price!!! Will purchase again in future!! Thanks</li>
    <li> Shake well before using. It is a leave in conditioner which makes your hair softer after using it. Spray on and comb or style hair.</li>
    <li> Good service from seller, but I returned it. It looked milky at the top of the bottle and don&#x27;t know if that was normal. Didn&#x27;t work well or take out tangles. I have finer, thinner, colored, long hair.</li>
    <li> This is Mom&#x27;s favorite hairspray  -- lots of control, without stiffness.</li>
    <li> This is like a leave on conditioner.  Just spray and it detangles and moisturizes your hair.  My hair feels thicker and has more body.. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. Love it.</li>

I don&#x27;t use it every day, but it is nice to keep on hand when I need a little extra moisture when styling my hair dry. It has a really nice smell and adds glorious shine! I would recommend anyone with course, curly, frizz-prone hair to give it a try!</li>
