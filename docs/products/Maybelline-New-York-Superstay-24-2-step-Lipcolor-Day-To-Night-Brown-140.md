<li> Long lasting moist lipstick.</li>
<li> It seems very old, the lipstick is all dried up.  </li>
<li> I like the fact that it stays for a long time even after eating and drinking</li>
<li> one is a little too dark and the other is a little too light</li>
<li> I think that  economically it would  be less expensive because you don&#x27;t use it as frequently.</li>
<li> The color last all day, and all you have to do is reapply the balm a few times.</li>
<li> but there is a little rough texture to it before you apply the sealer.</li>
<li> Tooo dark and brown for me.</li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t the seller, I got it on time and in good condition, but the product is horrible!</li>
<li> I blow on it a few times and then apply&lt;br /&gt;the gloss stick.  </li>
<li> Waste of money!</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s difficult to find in stores.</li>
<li> power was non existent and it flakes like crazy!</li>
<li> Very disappointed and will not reorder.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the type to do touch ups all day. If I could just get all of my makeup to stay in place.</li>
    <li> This arrived before i expected and its really beautiful!! Thank you.-</li>
    <li> This lip color is really great! It is really easy to use, and there is no mess, which is great. The lip color applicator is really easy to use and gives you precise lines. The balm is nice and glossy and looks great, and is easy to apply- just like putting on chap stick or lip gloss. I did a few tests of my own to see if the lip color came off on white materials, and it didnt, all that came off was a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; looking lip stain, which was the balm that goes over the color, but no color came off! The color last all day, and all you have to do is reapply the balm a few times. I really like this and would recommend it! Plus it comes in 30 different shades!    I was given this product to test and review (not this particular color, but this kind) but was NOT told to review here or anywhere else. I am a BzzAgent, and received a product sample.</li>
    <li> Tooo dark and brown for me. I gave it to my brunette daughter, she might be able to carry it off with her darker coloring.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite 24hr lipstick...never cracks or  looks dry.  I highly recommend this to anyone who likes to have their lipstick last.</li>
    <li> It seems very old, the lipstick is all dried up.  Very disappointed and will not reorder.</li>
    <li> Maybelline discontinued this color...gotta love Amazon.com!! ;-)</li>
    <li> I am very happy and satisfied with this color. I get many compliments and it looks great with my skin tone. Since I am no longer able to find this color in stores, I am happy to find a company who still carries it. And I hope they will continue to do so because I plan to purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this lipstick. It stays on forever. At night I have to wash it off.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom she love brown lip stick she was so happy, will be getting this color again.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it stays for a long time even after eating and drinking but there is a little rough texture to it before you apply the sealer. I bought two colors one is a little too dark and the other is a little too light but they are both good colors, just not what I usually wear. I think that  economically it would  be less expensive because you don&#x27;t use it as frequently. I would recommend it to my friends to try.</li>
    <li> IM VERY HAPPY BEAUTIFUL COLORS</li>
    <li> The product is fantastic and the color lasts 24 hours. I started using this product a year ago and have been reordering in different colors ever since. I have yet to find anything that lasts as long as Maybelline New York Superstay 24, 2-step. Great service and packaging which arrived before delivery date.</li>
    <li> My order was received quickly. I had no problems with my lipstick, it&#x27;s my favorite and the only color I wear so it&#x27;s difficult to find in stores. This is a great way to continue to stock up!!</li>
    <li> When applied as recommended it does not come off on eating or drinking utensils and lasts for several hours. I love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice color and stays long on lips. Highly recommend this 24 hr color stay brand by maybelline. Good product rev</li>
    <li> Long lasting moist lipstick.</li>
    <li> My favorite.  Really wears well.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  This lipstick is not like&lt;br /&gt;regular lipstick.  Put it on.  Wait until almost&lt;br /&gt;dry. I blow on it a few times and then apply&lt;br /&gt;the gloss stick.  It will stay on all day.&lt;br /&gt;Of course you might reuse the gloss stick&lt;br /&gt;to remoisten the lips.  I do not.  The whole&lt;br /&gt;purpose of using it is to avoid the lipstick&lt;br /&gt;hassle.  I love this product.  But Maybelline&lt;br /&gt;should have more dark color choices.&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I use tea oil to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this product works well for me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely was 100% upset with this purchase!!! It wasn&#x27;t the seller, I got it on time and in good condition, but the product is horrible! It&#x27;s staying power was non existent and it flakes like crazy! Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I am thrilled.  I have looked at so many places for this particular color (even checked in Puerto Rico) and even the stores that advertised that they had the color, there were never any in stock!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy to have my color again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted😊 Can&#x27;t find the color in stores anymore.</li>
