      <li>Just a little dab does a great job.  </li>
      <li>It works, it leaves your skin fresh, and delivers results.</li>
      <li>My skin is quite sensitive and it has been one of my favorite acne face washes of all time.</li>

      <li>my favorite face wash, it leaves your skin feeling silky and not dry.</li>
      <li>It rinses off fairly easily and my face always feels soft afterwards.</li>

      <li>I am IN LOVE with this facial wash.</li>
      <li>I love this product and will definitely buy it again when I run out!</li>
      <li>The face wash did reduce pimples, however the top came off of it and would not go back on.</li>
      <li>after you get the product and read the incredibly fine print on the back.  </li>
      <li>Himalaya drugs is a pioneer in herbal medicines and they are to be commended for the way they placed Indian herbal knowledge on a modern scientific pedestal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I use it and it helps a lot thanks</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much as a result.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>BTW did i mention that this was all natural!!!</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive and after trying pretty much everything out there, this is the facewash that works for me.  </li>
      <li>I bought a baby&#x27;s hair brush to apply it with and the soft bristles of the brush is just right for cleaning my face.  </li>
      <li>I use it twice daily and follow it up with Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Natural Acne solutions daily moisturizer, and my skin has been amazing ever since.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend this herbal face wash.</li>
      <li>feels so clean after using and does not over dry or irritate my sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Leaves my face very soft.</li>
      <li>I have only been using it for a few days, and though the scent and cool after washing is nice, it does not clean as much.</li>
      <li>This kind of face wash is a very thick gel.  </li>
      <li>Neem &amp; Tumeric are holistically and medicinally known for centuries to clear acne, (cystic, blackheads, whiteheads, hormonal, etc), and the scarring that comes with it.</li>
      <li>but I like it so far.</li>
      <li>That being said, it did not irritate my sensitive skin or make me break out.  </li>
      <li>Natural and organic way to keep the skin clear of oil, dirt with no side affects whatsoever</li>
      <li>, it dries the skin considerably.</li>
      <li>My face is soft and supple with this product.</li>
      <li>but I like it so far.</li>
      <li>yes it is all natural.</li>
      <li>I will continue with my baking soda and use this more as a secondary wash, whenever I need to wake up.</li>
      <li>and I was kind of confused.</li>
      <li>Excessive drying of the skin only makes it want to produce more oil.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Make sure you get your hands wet and just use a little as it lathers rather well.</li>
      <li>It really helps to dry up blemish alot quicker.</li>
      <li>I am not sure of the long term use, however i will update if there is any change, but as of now i am enjoying my product.</li>
      <li>since I am not a teen or young adult--how about a baby boomer!</li>
      <li>it only being half full...</li>
      <li>I have been using this now, in combination with organic pure coconut oil, and the Konjac Sponges, charcoal being one of my favorites for its ability to pull out any residual debris &amp; toxins trapped deep within your pores, while exfoliating gently.</li>
      <li>Neem Face Wash cleans completely, controls oily skin, but doesn&#x27;t dry out the face</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My face was breaking out all of a sudden.  I used this product twice a day with one of those battery-operated brushes, and no more pimples.  It has the consistency of aloe vera and smells really nice.  I love this product and will definitely buy it again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it with my Clarisonic brush along with neem anti blemish lotion and neem tablets. In one month my face went from an acne mess to a very decent looking, with smooth skin and good color.&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that the producers didn&#x27;t use the green dye in the wash, it bothers me since I strive to keep chemicals in the cosmetics I use to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it dries the skin considerably.</li>
    <li> Natural and organic way to keep the skin clear of oil, dirt with no side affects whatsoever</li>
    <li> I got my order and the bottle was a little over half full and it just looks like aloe gel... I will let u know if it works but so far I&#x27;m not happy with it it only being half full...</li>
    <li> I am not seeing any change in my face after using it from the day I receive to now. I feel like i have been deceived for my money.</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied with condition of product&#x27;s tube at all.</li>
    <li> Best product ! Neem is the best out there to fight any viral bacterial or fungal infections ! Indian products rocks !! #gonatural</li>
    <li> foams up really nice and my skin feels really clean after using</li>
    <li> This product is way too drying.  Excessive drying of the skin only makes it want to produce more oil.&lt;br /&gt;This product also has parabens.  I specifically wanted a paraben free product and you can&#x27;t tell that&lt;br /&gt;until after you get the product and read the incredibly fine print on the back.  I would not recommend&lt;br /&gt;or purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> The product itself is okay, I&#x27;ve purchased and used it before, but I am greatly disappointed that this one arrived unsealed and not filled. As if it has been used from already. I don&#x27;t think I will be using it.</li>
    <li> AMAZING.  I&#x27;m 26 and have had problems with breakouts for the last few years.  My skin is very sensitive and after trying pretty much everything out there, this is the facewash that works for me.  I use it twice daily and follow it up with Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Natural Acne solutions daily moisturizer, and my skin has been amazing ever since.  I&#x27;m finally feeling comfortable in my own skin and confident and able to go makeup free and it feels great! I highly recommend this product! Thank you!</li>
    <li> i was in search of a new product to use as a face wash, cause i used my normal face wash for a long time and wanted something new but not too expensive. I came across this product in my search on amazon.com and decided to give it a try. The product arrived just in time. I used it the very instant it came and to my surprise my face looked different. I am not sure of the long term use, however i will update if there is any change, but as of now i am enjoying my product. BTW did i mention that this was all natural!!! yes it is all natural. I also received a free Himalaya tooth paste. Thanks</li>
    <li> The product does not lather as I expected it would. It has more of the consistency of aloe vera gel. I haven&#x27;t used it much as a result.</li>
    <li> love this product. feels so clean after using and does not over dry or irritate my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> The product did not even come !!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing results. I have been using this product for a few days now and even though the smell is not great, this product works!</li>
    <li> I love this face wash! Very effective for blemishes and I only need a small amount. Very light in fragrance which is also a plus for me. My skin is quite sensitive and it has been one of my favorite acne face washes of all time.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser and have been using it for years. I have extremely sensitive skin and my skin reacts very badly to every other cleanser that I&#x27;ve tried except this. Other cleansers either make me breakout or peel, but this one isn&#x27;t too drying but cleanses perfectly well. If you are lathering with your hands tho, it can be hard to create foam and can leave your skin slippery. I recommend using either an electronic cleansing brush such as a clarisonic or something of the sort.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good facial cleanser.  It has a bit of a fragrance to it.  It is a nice smell, not a bad one.  I just prefer to use products which do not have any fragrance in them.  That being said, it did not irritate my sensitive skin or make me break out.  Make sure you get your hands wet and just use a little as it lathers rather well.</li>
    <li> This product did not do much for my acne, but probably fine for someone with normal skin.</li>
    <li> I use it and it helps a lot thanks</li>
    <li> My face is soft and supple with this product.</li>
    <li> It is fresh and light on the skin. I like it.</li>
    <li> Face wash is good, nice fresh smell and cleans face well.</li>
    <li> Product works great and smells fresh.</li>
    <li> Not very good. But still fine.</li>
    <li> Neem &amp; Tumeric are holistically and medicinally known for centuries to clear acne, (cystic, blackheads, whiteheads, hormonal, etc), and the scarring that comes with it. I have been using this now, in combination with organic pure coconut oil, and the Konjac Sponges, charcoal being one of my favorites for its ability to pull out any residual debris &amp; toxins trapped deep within your pores, while exfoliating gently.

    <li> Good quality face cleaner. Nicely scented and rinses off with no film. Does a good job removing access oil as well as dirt.</li>
    <li> I love this and all products from them!  HH is shipped from&lt;br /&gt;India but i got it in 2 days last time and longer, like 2 weeks before, but as long as i keep getting it, i don.t care!&lt;br /&gt;the toothpaste, cleanser, scrub and moisturizer were purchased. All work great, leave skin feeling great, and daily use is clearing up skin nicely.&lt;br /&gt;/they smell clean and fresh. i have skin allergies to most stuff and i don.t get itchy or rash or any problems. I can&#x27;t wait to buy the rest of the line!&lt;br /&gt;I told my friend and she loves the cleanser and is using the other bottle i bought! We will order more soon!</li>
    <li> Clean my face well. Love it!</li>
    <li> Neem Face Wash cleans completely, controls oily skin, but doesn&#x27;t dry out the face and it doesn&#x27;t burn the eyes.  Just a little dab does a great job.  Would recommend this for an every day face wash.</li>
    <li> It works, it leaves your skin fresh, and delivers results. I reordered it!</li>
    <li> Really like the product!!</li>
    <li> The face wash did reduce pimples, however the top came off of it and would not go back on. This dried out the face wash and I am disappointed with the quality of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days but I like it so far.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give it a five star review but I do like it a lot and the way my skin feel after cleaning with it.  I bought a baby&#x27;s hair brush to apply it with and the soft bristles of the brush is just right for cleaning my face.  I suppose you could buy a complextion brush but I couldn&#x27;t find one.  I like all Neem products.  The bars of soap are great as well for the face or shower.  The bars of soap are great for traveling by air since your limited with liquids and creams.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  Love this face wash.  It gets skin clean and fights any pimple.  Acne dries up in 2 days!</li>
    <li> Leaves my face very soft. Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see how it controls acne but I like it so far.</li>
    <li> Himalaya drugs is a pioneer in herbal medicines and they are to be commended for the way they placed Indian herbal knowledge on a modern scientific pedestal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is made of a blend of Neem and Turmeric. Both of these are known for their benevolent effect upon skin. In combination, they can be a great help to those who suffer from acne/pimples. What is more, the formulation is very pleasant to use. Being herbal formulations, there is no reported side effects -- though all medications, herbal or allopathic, always need to be tested before one uses them regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this herbal face wash.</li>
    <li> The ingredients list contains parabens and urea. Google the health side effects of these chemicals before purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The US Food and Drug Admin. is much less stringent about what chemicals are allowed in personal-care products than the European Union, for example. Small amounts of unhealthy chemicals add up over time and across multiple products. Your skin is absorbent!</li>

    <li> This is a great product especially  if you have oily skin. It really helps to dry up blemish alot quicker.</li>
    <li> It was a great product also will reorder it again.</li>
    <li> This kind of face wash is a very thick gel.  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily get foamy or anything, just really thick and slimy.  I use this with my Mia every night in conjunction with another face wash in the morning.  I have had no issues.  It rinses off fairly easily and my face always feels soft afterwards.</li>
    <li> With using this Face Wash I thought I would not get pimples but I have been getting really bad big pimples and it&#x27;s not helping at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few days and my face has broken out with little pimples, etc. I am thoroughly disgusted since I am not a teen or young adult--how about a baby boomer! I thought this product was going to be just a Good facial cleanser for me, nothing more. But instead, as stated earlier what I &amp;#34;got&amp;#34; was cheek-to-cheek pimples (and forehead too). Now I have to counter what has been done to my face--omg!!!!!</li>
    <li> Himalaya Brand is a trusted Indian Brand with a lot of good natural properties - Turmeric plays a great role in reducing acne and is generally used in its powder form (best mixed with Honey and Cinnamon) and is applied on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend everyone to have Turmeric products in their daily use - Be it in the form of cream or supplements or while cooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Team Nutri Dime&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00M9F4CHQ Turmeric Curcumin for Acne - 670mg | 95% Curcuminoids]]</li>
    <li> This face wash is awesome</li>
    <li> There are 2 versions of this product and I was kind of confused. This face wash was died green and the other one came in a dark teal plastic bottle thats a little larger. this product was okay but I was not overly impressed nor did it work any miracles after 6 months of use.</li>
    <li> I am really disappointed</li>
    <li> for my daughter she loves it</li>
    <li> I have used countless products for my face it was all worthless.  I heard a lot of name and fame of Himalaya  product in india  it never got chances to use it, may be because of my  financial problem back in India,&lt;br /&gt;  Now Himalaya Neem product has changed my face , I loved it , amazing brand  you&#x27;ll may buy any product of Himalaya according to your problems on you body you will definitely see the changes.  Go 4r it . IT&#x27;S INdians HIMALAYA. Awesome.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and works very good for acne</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for a few days, and though the scent and cool after washing is nice, it does not clean as much. If you have oily skin, this might not be as helpful. I will continue with my baking soda and use this more as a secondary wash, whenever I need to wake up.</li>
    <li> Use it every day, has an OK smell, not a heavy lather, you can feel your skin is clean...does the good, will buy again...</li>
