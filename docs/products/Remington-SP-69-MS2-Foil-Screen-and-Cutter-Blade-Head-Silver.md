<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It was just what I was looking for!  Now I need info on Amazon Plus, for movies and TV!</li>
    <li> What can I say? They wear out and have to be replaced. These are the original replacement parts, and are just fine.</li>
    <li> Needed replacement screens which they don&#x27;t sell with out the blade but good product for price it works on my shaver and that&#x27;s what counts</li>
    <li> I bought my first replacement kit from amazing Amazon about six months ago. It arrived in the blink of an eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did as instructed, removing the casing from the head of the razor and inserting the new foils and blades. It worked just fine. Trouble was that in two weeks, the mesh began to develop holes. It was as if they had been made with cheesey aluminum paper-thin foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the seller, I-Shaver, who sent me replacements of the replacements when I seriously and legitimately asked them in an email whether the company sold first-quality or seconds. The answer was abrupt. &amp;#34;All our products are first-quality.&amp;#34;  Un-huh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I used the razor with the second set of replacements until the mesh-holes began to appear in a few months. I figured that Remington builds in obsolescence because they&#x27;re going to cash in on replacement parts as often as Gillette cashes in on consumers&#x27; buying blades for their razors. No longer do the foils last months and months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair enough. American ingenuity to make a buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered two more replacements sets from amazing Amazon. When they arrived fifteen minutes later, I inserted the foils and the new blades. I turned on the razor, and, astoundingly, everything flew everywhere around the room. I was as if a pressure-cooker has exploded. Foils and blades in all directions. I chuckled, thinking I had not snapped securely the casing that holds all this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my hands and knees, I fanned the floor with the palm of my hand, feeling for these tiny parts. After i collected all of them, I re-inserted them and pushed down extra firmly on the casing. Well, the same thing happened. Explosion. Hands and knees again. Palm the floor again. Inserted the things again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, though, when I went to insert the foils into the razor-head casing, I saw that these little rubbed squidgies were missing from the ends of the foil casings. They are pieces of ribbed rubberthat apparently allow some give-and-take as the foils go over the hills and valleys and folds and crannies of all kinds of faces. They look like little shock-absorbers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story longer, I took out the new set and experience the same problem. But I needed the razor that morning, so I gathered the pieces, inserted them again, and with duct tape, I fastened the rubberless foil fixtures to the razor itself so that they wouldn&#x27;t fly off and take with them the blades. The razor looks ridiculous, but the foils and blades stay put when the razor is turned on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington&#x27;s clever. First, they outsource the manufacture of the product and make scads of money by paying slave wages to Chinese workers and selling a low-to-no quality product at the same high prices to Americans. Remington must think all we Americans consumers are stooooooopid. Chinese people, I am sure, enjoy having the work, but how much of yourself would YOU invest in the quality of a product if you&#x27;re treated like a serf in the work-force? Not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another ploy. Try to find Remington replacements in the Big Box stores or any store, for that matter anymore. I used to get them at Target. The stock clerk at Target told me that Remington doesn&#x27;t retail them anymore in walk-through stores. It&#x27;s their way of getting you to buy a whole new razor. No replacements. New razor. So transparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from Remington products. They&#x27;re outsourced. Fabrique en Chine. And you know what that means!!!! Low pay. Low quality. Low-life American manufacturers.</li>
    <li> Cheap price, good delivery time, fell right into place upon installation. fit is a little sloppy, but they get the job done, and look forward to another good deal such as this.</li>
    <li> It did not fit...I destroyed it by trying to make it fit...had to throw it away and buy a new razor...total waste of $25!!!!</li>
    <li> It is so great to have a place like Amazon that sells so many things.  I had looked in so many of my local stores to find these replacement blades for my father&#x27;s shaver, and no one sells them.  I thought we were in trouble until I checked this site.  My father is happy, his caregiver is happy, and so I&#x27;m happy.  He can still use his shaver..  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> Simple fact: Foils wear out.  By the time they wear out, the cutters are starting to round off...  You notice it by getting \\&quot;Five o&#x27;Clock Shadow\\&quot; at Three-Thirty.  I replace my foil (screen) about twice a year and get blade-close shaves as a result.&lt;br /&gt;HINT:  If you want the best shave and you want the screen and cutters to last, wash your face with soap and warm water first.  Then rinse and dry and THEN shave.  Your beard will be softer and easier to cut close, and the dust that collects on your skin won&#x27;t be there, so your cutters and screen will last longer.  Clean your shaver daily, and use a shaver treatment (like the spray-in from Remington) once a week and you will have a good shave from the first day to day 180 or even day 200.&lt;br /&gt;Just keep in mind that you will need to replace the cutters and screen regularly and you&#x27;ll do fine.</li>
    <li> What should I say here?  They will fit and do what they are supposed to.... arrived in good condition and ready to use.</li>
    <li> Like having a new razor! As long as my shaver holds out, I will continue to buy this product. Great!</li>
    <li> The Screen and cutter blades last about 3 to 4 months with my beard.  To make things easy I always order 2 and hope I can make it to six months. I have tried rotary razors with little or no luck.  Inexpensive electric razors is a joke.  I&#x27;ve tried Braun with mixed results.  I still come back to Remington.  Single blade razors with shaving cream could possibly work but I started using electric razors at a young age.  Call me biased.  I guess I&#x27;m just happy with my Remington SP-69</li>
    <li> New screen &amp; cutter head always brings my razor back to like new performance. Almost bought a new razor until I saw the low price you offered for this.</li>
    <li> This cutter fit my husband razor perfectly , it was just what we needed. The transaction was handled without any problems.Thank you</li>
    <li> My Remington shaver is at least 10 years old and replacement screens and cutter heads are no longer available locally. I am glad I can buy them on-line. It saves me from buying a new shaver.</li>
    <li> if they last 30 days without getting a hole in them i&#x27;m lucky, need a little thicker or stronger metal</li>
    <li> Just what&#x27;s needed.  I did buy some lubricant after this purchase though.  I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Within less than a month, these replacement cutters were no better than the ones in the shaver - that I had been using for a year !      I was puzzled, but now realize that they were not made by Remington but were cheap knock-offs.  I had thrown out the packing so I could not verify this.  When I ordered I thought that these were made by Remington; I did not see anything on the order page to indicate that these were made by someone else.  This is something that Amazon should disclose.    From now on I will order through Remington, even if they cost more.  Cheaper sometimes means cheap.                  Bob</li>
    <li> This is a periodic maintenance item if you own a Remmington electric razor.  Based on my usage, I need to replace the screens (and cutter) about once a year - when the screen(s) develop a hole and you can no longer use the razor without ripping up your face.  I must admit, the razor performs like brand new after installing this kit.  Installation installation time required: 3 minutes (2 minutes to read the instructions several times, 1 minute to install the parts).</li>
    <li> Amazon mailed item to wrong address.  All mailed items were to be mailed to home address.  Other address was for UPS or FedEx only. Item was returned and credit for item was issued?? but credit for rest of costs in limbo.  Still need item mailed to my home address, but not sure what is going on.  Do I need to reorder? Has credit for $16.99 been put on my account? When will credit for $5.40 be issued? When will I finally receive the item at the right address? Why have conversations with Amazon been ignored?  Why was request to talk to supervisor ignored?  Does Amazon want my business?  Very difficult to deal with your company!!!!!!</li>
    <li> These are the correct screens and cutters for the Remington MS2 shavers. They are not available in retail stores near me anymore. My old MS2 razor does a good job if you can find the screens and cutters (and replace the battery over time).  So, thanks Amazon for making the needed parts readily available online. Price and speed of delivery were good.</li>
    <li> Long-lasting supplies for the best razor I&#x27;ve owned in the past 20 years...too bad Remington discontinued the razor!</li>
    <li> Literally what the review title says. You do get what you pay for. I will never buy cheapo wanna be \\&quot;supposedly\\&quot; made by Remington junk from Ebay ever again. They are half price, but junk. They come in a little white box barely big enough to fit the blades in. They rip hairs on the sides when they get caught betweel the microshield and the housing. They last less than half the time, and you learn there is only way you can shave around a goatee to keep from ripping hairs out.  I was ever so happy after receiving this GENUINE Remington replacement set and being able to use it without worry of painful shaving.  You can buy from the generic if you want, but you will fing a far inferior product and it may truly be a painful experience !  Edit of my review...  I see several negative reviews saying they are cheap knock offs. If you do not get what is pictured in the manufacturers blister packagine - SEND THEM BACK ! ! ! They are a cheap immitation and the seller needs to be reported to Amazon. I am sure that trick will not be tolerated. This product in it&#x27;s origonal form is that real deal. It is far superior to the generic blank paperboard unlabeled product.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and in good condition.  These screens and cutter blade heads last a loong time.  If you remember to put the plastic protector back on the shaver.  They initially shave me as close as a barber with a straight razor and soap.  After a while, it takes more and more \\&quot;passes\\&quot; to achieve that silky feeling, but I keep using the same assembly until eventually, years later, part of the screen wears thru.  Recommend brushing out the assembly after each shave.  I&#x27;ve learned to use Remington Shaver Saver spray once in a while to prolong the life of the screen.</li>
    <li> This item had a very good price. It is in the original factory package.  .Remington is a very good name.</li>
    <li> I thought the bad reviews where not accurate. I was wrong. The blades are really dull. It worse than the ones I replaced. It is back to Walmart for me.</li>
    <li> Pricey just like the razor but not a bad price through Amazon.  I replace every 5-6 months as recommended under automatic re-order plan with Amazon.</li>
    <li> My old foil had actually worn a hole in it! I replace my shaver heads every 2 years anyway. This was an easy replacement, taking less than one minute.</li>
    <li> In packaging as pictured. Exact as original.</li>
    <li> Sent my purchase to Remington to confirm, these are not theirs and sub par.  Shouldn&#x27;t lie and will never buy from this outlet again</li>
    <li> I was going to buy a new razor when all I needed was a new screen and cutters. Now that I&#x27;ve figured out how to change them I can continue to use the old razor that I like and save the cost of a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement instructions and images are difficult to figure out and see; at least they were for me. The trick is the screen comes out through the top or the side that goes against your face. Use a small flat blade screwdriver or similar item to push the side of the screen toward the center from the under side. This will get the screen clear of the housing. Once you do that they come right out from the top.</li>
    <li> Items arrived exactly as described, worked exactly as intended, and shave as close as I care to get.  Will buy again.  A++</li>
    <li> Instructions are a little hard to read (screens need to be inserted from top of removable screen holder frame toward inside-bottom of frame). Other than that, works well. You can probably extend the life of the screen by using less pressure during your shave.</li>
    <li> It did an excellent job just what was needed to make the shaver cut live a new one</li>
    <li> Definitely improved shaving    Fit in fine with my shaver and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> excellent product, i would like to purchase more.                                                                     thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought my Remington shaver back in 2004, so it&#x27;s lasted 6 years this far.  With the purchase of these blades, which are simple to snap in, it&#x27;s as good as new!</li>
    <li> I love my Remington electric razor, but after a year the performance was down.  This kit did the trick, and now I&#x27;m back to smooth shaves.  I did have some trouble getting the old screens off.  It wasn&#x27;t as easy as the instructions made it sound.</li>
    <li> I found something had made a puncture hole in the cutting foil on my Remington shaver, so I needed to either get new blades or buy a new shaver. The shaver&#x27;s battery was still able to hold a decent charge so I decided to just replace the old blades with new ones. These blades were an exact match for my shaver and work great. They took about a week until they were cutting well, but I think that was because new blades need some use to bed in. Now they are cutting great and I&#x27;m really happy I didn&#x27;t need to buy a whole new shaver.</li>
    <li> This shaver shaves quite close.  Close enough for anything but a cheek to cheek cuddle.  It also runs a long time without recharging.  Have found it to be quite easy to clean.  Overall, this razor exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I assumed that this product was an actual Remington item. I feel sure now that it is not. I have shaved with Remington foil razors for years. I have a fine-textured beard and usually get about 2 years out of a foil. This product gave me about 3 months before disintegrating. Also the cutters seem to be of questionable quality. I recommend staying away from this product; it would actually be cheaper to buy a new razor than to buy these inferior quality, short-life foils and cutters.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the original US made model made you replace the whole screen even tough only half of it went bad (screen tore). This Chinese design allows one of the two screens to be replaced. As much as I hate to say it, this is a huge improvement, too bad the razor itself won&#x27;t last as long as it&#x27;s US made original.</li>
    <li> Makes the shaver work as good as new, Only four stars because of value, a major portion of the price of the whole shaver. But the real screens are superior to the generic ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this replacement foil screen/cutter blades for a few months now.  They fit perfectly and brought new life to my old razor.  No need to buy a new razor when all I needed was new screens and blades.</li>
    <li> The replacement screen and cutters arrived very promptly, in excellent condtion.  They were easy to install and are working very well.  The shaver performs like new again. And with the automatic order every 6 months, I believe the pricing is a very good value.</li>
    <li> These perform worse than the two year old screen and blades I was using before.  These don&#x27;t shave as close and so it takes longer to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Came quickly in new condition.  My husband can now keep the shaver he enjoys using.</li>
    <li> I found this replacment difficult to install. The foil blade covers were very fragile and difficult to install. The cutters despite Remington &amp;#34;Cut closer than a razor&amp;#34; claim, they leave a heavy stubble and I have to finish my shave with my Norelco followed by a Gillette Fusion power. When this set of blades dull I will replace the Remington with a new Norelco</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m signed up for automatic shipment every 6 months for this product. I like the fact I don&#x27;t have to remember to change the blades on my razor and I also like cost saving and free shipping. Nothing to say about product since I have no choice.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good idea to get new Remington screen foils and cutters on a regular basis.  I hadn&#x27;t in a long time in part because local stores had stopped carrying them.  I had seen some negative reviews about people receiving damaged foil screens from prior Amazon shippers using bulk screens that weren&#x27;t individually packaged.  My screens and cutters were packaged in pairs in separate sections just like they were when I could find these Remington replacements at the drug store or discount store.  Amazon shipping was quick (3 or 4 days, I think) and the replacement parts were not to hard to install.  Getting the old foils out of the shaver head can be a little tricky.</li>
    <li> Althought the electric razor itself does the job (close shave), the foil screens easily \\&quot;chip\\&quot; creating holes.  Once a hole is formed in the foil screen, the interior blades do a job on your unprotected face.  And I am talking about very small chips in the foil screen itself. In less than a year, I am on my third set of foil screens. The screens on this Remington come in pairs and they are difficult to remove and to replace from the shave head. I wish I had kept my old Remington shaver...one foil screen and one cutter blade head.</li>
    <li> I only gave 3* because it does not work as well as original, difficult to install and will not shave as close as original parts. would be hesitant to recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great that I can keep my razor going after all this time. WAY better than buying a new one. Very happy with Remmington about now.</li>
    <li> This seller set&#x27;s a very high mark for others to strive for!  Was completely thrilled with transaction!  Will defo purchase from them again!</li>
    <li> Made razor like new. No more nicks. Great investment reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Product works fine,not the easiest to install.</li>
    <li> Great !,  Fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> Made my old razor like new again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to replace the original cutter head on my Remington electric razor. Actually it did a better job than the cutters that came on the new razor sop, I have to say that I am well pleased and recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Like Braun screens the Remington screens are thin and flimsy. One must carefully look at the screens b4 shaving or risk getting nasty nicks/cuts. These replace easily and do the job.</li>
    <li> The Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men&#x27;s Shaver was a Christmas gift for my husband&#x27;s step-father.  I read reviews and thought I made a great choice.  By New Year&#x27;s Day he asked us to get our money back.  What a waste!  We were mortified.</li>
    <li> Our shaver is working great now that we replaced the blades/head. It works just like new. I&#x27;d recommend the shaver for everyday use.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews I decided to buy the blades from Wal Mart. Lucky I did because the blades would not cut all my wiskers and left my face feeling unshaved. I returned the NEW blades and installed the eight month old blades. I will continue to use the razor for now as it still gives me a decent shave but will never buy a Remington product again.</li>
    <li> I use this for shaving my head every other day.  It cuts close, smooth, and cool.</li>
    <li> No fun shaving with a worn out screen. The best price I could find was at Amazon after bundling it with another item to get free shipping. Nice doing business with the pros!</li>
    <li> Great! Works perfectly! Wasn&#x27;t sure we could fix the razor and get back to using it, but this was just the ticket.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and packaged exactly as pictured. These are original, sealed replacement parts which install in under 2 minutes.  I wish I found these blades on Amazon earlier!</li>
    <li> the cutters and screens work very well for me</li>
    <li> The order arrived quickly and my husband is happy to have a new screen and cutter for his beloved razor!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product, it makes an old razor like new!  Easy to install and works perfect.  I hope they continue to carry this item, otherwise the razor would have been worthless.</li>
    <li> its OK  -  no problem, just happens yo bve what I hafve to  have for my existing shaver.The  only  problem I have is the review -- not the item I purchased.</li>
    <li> The replacement foil screen and cutter blade head was not a perfect fit (a little tight), but has done the job for the most part.  The shaver works and is as good as it was before my old one got punctured (how the hell that happened I have NO idea, but probably has something to do with my three kids).</li>
    <li> The new replacement blades and foil made the razor like new.  Check Wal-mart.  I found it cheaper there.</li>
    <li> sharp, easy to install. gave new life to my foil shaver</li>
    <li> Good shave, what more can I say</li>
    <li> Remington SP-69 MS2 Foil Screen &amp; Cutter Blade Head was a perfect fit for my shaver. I had forgotten how good the razor actually worked when it was new.</li>
    <li> I could not find a replacement head for my Remington Platinum Electric razor anywhere in the immediate area, so I went on line and found an excellent buy at Amazon.com.  The last time I bought the same head at Walmart it was about $25 including tax. For $39.98 I received 2 heads, so I am fixed for about a year, thanks to Amazon.com., and I also saved about $12 !</li>
    <li> worked fine, this fit the models as described and I am happy with the purchase.I wish they would last just a bit longer</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re replacement parts for the Remington shaver model I have. They work. Nothing too special about &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> The product is faulty and doesn&#x27;t work.  Replacing the worn parts of the Remington electric shaver with the new ones   was no problem but it does not cut.  Very much disappointing and a waste of money.  Had to purchse a new electric shaver.  Would like to get a refund that was paid because the product was faulty.</li>
    <li> I was a bit nervous ordering the replacement foils/blades after reading some of the previous comments, but went ahead with the purchase because the foil heads had worn through on my shaver and I needed to do something.  The product that was shipped exactly matched the picture and description shown, in other words, it arrived in the OEM Remington packaging (not in a plain brown box) as depicted.  Took me about 5 minutes to pop out the old foils/blades and reinstall the new ones.  I have ordered replacement blades/foils in the past and gotten \\&quot;bulk\\&quot; items in a plain brown box, but not this time.  I am VERY PLEASED with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I received a brand-new Remington SP-69 MS2 Foil Screen &amp; Cutter Blade Head in the package, just like in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fit my Remington Microscreen Razor perfectly and now it shaves close without irritation.</li>
    <li> I have owned Remington electric razors for years, and this is the first time I have received sub-par blades and screens that actually pull your facial hair out.  As many other reviews have pointed out, these are obviously cheap knock offs.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> The screen and blades make the shaver like new. Instructions aren&#x27;t clear but it&#x27;s easy enough to figure out how to insert the new screens.</li>
    <li> these replacement parts for my razor fit the bill. can&#x27;t ask for more. what more do i need to say</li>
    <li> Very poor quality.  Have had a lot of difficulty finding remington blades and quality is questionable.  Decided to buy a Braun razor.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> I use this daily of course &amp; they wear out too quick &amp; are too stinkin expensive. The screen develops holes &amp; then the bare blades dice your face.</li>
    <li> I have an ancient Remington micro-screen razor that I use daily. Because the razor is so old, it is no longer possible to buy replacement foils and cutters locally. Since I am able to nurse about a year of use from the blades and foils, it works out to about a dollar a month to shave daily.  There is no better deal.  Amended 4/3/16: I had to down grade the product because once I installed the blades in January of 2016, I discovered that they seem to be smaller than the originals. Because of this it is impossible to get a good shave. I put in some old blades from 2014 and am getting a better shave with them! I hope this is just a quality problem with the batch mine came from, since these are real OEM Remington blades.  UPDATE: I ordered a set of two for $11.99 since the first batch weren&#x27;t sharp and did not fit and I hoped I could get a bit of time of of the two fer deal. I was hoping the first order was a bad batch. I have had one of the new sets of blades and foils on for a month, and they cut like the original. They also stay on the razor. The foils have already outlasted the last order. Note that the new packaging looks different from the OEM packaging shown. Because of the success I am having with the new sets, I have raised my rating from 2 star to 4 star.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very intellligent, yet understanding what had to be done to install the screen was difficult. It took about 15 minutes to perform the 1 minute installation because a major step was not clear or intuitive.</li>
    <li> I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED IN A REMONGTON PRODUCT OR IN THE FACT THAT AMAZON WOULD SELL A TOTALLY DEFECTIVE PRODUCT .  I&#x27;VE ALWAYS BEEN AWARE THAT IT TAKES ABOUT 2  WEEKS FOR FOR AN ASSEMBLY LIKE THIS TO BE USED BEFORE IT WILL CUT AS IT SHOULD .   IT WAS A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE ATTEMPING TO USE THIS PRODUCT . IT FELT LIKE MY WHISKERS WERE BEING PULLED OUT . I HAD TO SHAVE TWICE A DAY TO GET A BELOW PAR SHAVE . FINALLY , I PUCHASED ANOTHER NEW REMINTON RAZOR FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND IT MAY BE THE BEST REMINTON RAZOR THAT I&#x27;VE OWNED IN THE PAST 20 YEARS .  I HAD TO GO TO ANOTHER SOURCE BEFORE COMPLAINING BECAUSE I COULD NOT WAIT FOR MY PROBLEM TO RESOLVED .....I NEEDED A GOOD SHAVE AND TIME WAS IMPORTANT TO ME .</li>
    <li> I recently shaved my head so I was looking for a shaver that would expedite the morning ritual.  I was prepared to purchase a Braun when Google came up with a Consumer Report describing the Braun shaver.  But also in the article was a comparative article on the Remington SP-69.  The article stated for a $110 dollars less you get virtually the same shave.  I of course went for it and was impressed and surprised at the smoothness at the overall smoothness.  I of course bought an extra set of blades in the package deal to save even more.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I was completely satisfied with this transaction.  I have to replace these blades periodically, so I have a lot of experience buying this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever used.  It is slightly less effective that a razor and shaving cream shave.</li>
    <li> box arrived on time, price is good and now I&#x27;m enjoying good shaves again   only thing left to evaluate is how long they last ...</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine trying to save a few dollars by buying an off-brand shaving head.  I bought the Remmington razor as a gift, and I got the replacement head to go with it.  Always good to have a spare on hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good price on replacement heads and screens for my shaver, but the regular price was way too high.  Finally I was able to get my favorite shaver working again with these perfect fitting replacements.</li>
    <li> Hubby like them.  Good but overpriced.</li>
    <li> The products arrived in good shape in the origianl packages.  This is exactly what I wanted and saved some money in the process.</li>
    <li> These are very decent razors.  They come nicely packaged and were in perfect shape.  Unfortunately the razors could fit a little tighter since when I was shacking some hair off, the razor popped off and fell down the drain. I had to purchase some backups.  Be wary of shaving cleaning over an open drain!</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the wrong item that I ordered. The item (Remington SP-69 MS2 Screen &amp; Cutter Blade Head) The item that I ordered was the same match number of my personal shaver I use everyday,also the picture did not match the item a two Blade Screen shown. I recived a three Blade Screen in the mail I was vary disappointed. It will be too much trouble to send it back (Remington SP-69 MS2 Screen &amp; Cutter Blade Head)and request the right item that I paid $23.00 for. I do belive I will not ever buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> The unit came as advertised.  The old unit had a broken foil cover...The shaver itself is OK. I use it mostly to  trim my mustache. and occasionally to shave my face. I have had Norelco&#x27;s in the past and the rotary shave system seems to do a better job on my face. But usually I use a double blade or sometimes a triple blade depending upon price. and shaving cream. It seems to do a better job of removing hair off of my face.</li>
    <li> the package had already been opened.  It was also missing a small rubber piece.  I was able to save a rubber piece from my old one so I got lucky.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Quick delivery and exactly what was advertised.</li>
    <li> Just what we needed &amp; at a good price</li>
    <li> Just not a remington type of guy, item was delivered in a timely fashion and undamaged, my face just doesent like remington, I have a norelco face, sorry</li>
    <li> The product was just what I was looking for--at a good price--and it arrived soon after I placed the order. I was very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Glad I purchased the replacement screen and cutters since the screen did not last nearly as long as I expected.</li>
    <li> I have used this model razor for many years. The head is easy to change and rings the razor back to original condition.</li>
    <li> when I could not find the razor blade replacements at any store, I realized I should have gone to Amazon in the first place  So glad I did, as it is exactly what I needed and the arrival of the product was swift.</li>
    <li> Never having had an electric before, I didn&#x27;t realize the need to replace, periodically, the head and screen....  Once I did, it worked like new again.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints!</li>
    <li> These foils and cutters are exactly what I expected and the same as what they sell in the store for $6 more. My only complaint is the packaging. I didn&#x27;t have scissors with me when I needed to open this, so it was quite a challenge getting it open with a knife. Because of this, I&#x27;d give five stars to the product and two stars to the packaging.</li>
    <li> The exact replacement for my razor. Good, sharp blades. Works well.</li>
    <li> Worked just like the Original one and the razor works and preforms just like the original Foil Screen and Blade Head.</li>
    <li> This product works well for me.  The foil is of good quality.  It was packaged as shown.</li>
    <li> Received in excellent condition, on time, and as advertised.  Christmas gift for my husband.  He was thrilled.</li>
    <li> My husband had no problem installing the new screen and blades.  Electric razor is \\&quot;like new\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> The heads and blades came in a Remington blister pack as pictured in Amazon. I fitted them into my razor and everything worked perfectly, what more to ask?</li>
    <li> I have used my Remington Shaver for almost 14 years.  Occasionally I become dissatisfied with how it works and then remember that I have to buy replacement screens and cutters for it.  Then it works great again.  I have had these last almost 2 years under daily use, that&#x27;s pretty impressive.</li>
    <li> Hard to install but they work very well.</li>
    <li> the recent purchase wll be placed in service when an earlier buy is worn out. I bought this backup because of the good peformance of the product.</li>
    <li> I was initially disappointed upon receiving my replacement parts as the screens had been crushed and bent during shipping, having been crammed into a folded piece of cardboard for &#x27;protection&#x27;. However, since the screens bend and flex during use anyway, I decided to roll the dice and see if they&#x27;d function properly. The pieces snapped into place on the shaver with ease, the crumples do not seem to affect trimming ability, and they have revitalized my otherwise perfectly functioning Remington MS280 Titanium purchased several years ago. Great value compared to buying a whole new shaver.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of these during the past few years and the always work as advertised.</li>
    <li> Was worried about buying this based on reviews, so I waited until they got a bit more positive. Happy to say that my order was in the packaging just like the picture and worked well. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my MS280 razor and it fits and works perfectly.  A good buy for the money and delivered very promptly.</li>
    <li> A necessary evil - that I need to replace the heads and \\&quot;blades\\&quot; for this razor.  It&#x27;s a good product and shaves well but the thin \\&quot;head\\&quot; gets cut up and comes off leaving holes in the head itself.  Pays to examine the razor before using as shaving with a damaged head will cut the skin.  I always keep a spare replacement set in the house.  Thing is the Remington shaves a lot better than it&#x27;s competitors so I keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have used this screen and cutter head for many years and while all screens and cutters wear out;&lt;br /&gt;this one always seems to last a very long time before I need to replace it.</li>
    <li> Purchased online from Amazon, this item was new, sealed, and the lowest price I have ever found. I bought several just in case the price goes up. If you are looking at these blades, you probably own Remington and now that this is a great deal through Amazon. You are probably just looking at this review because you can&#x27;t believe the price. Just order it. It&#x27;s real.</li>
    <li> This is an actual Remington product; you can tell by the back of the package that refers to a Remington email address for any comments.  And it works great.</li>
    <li> razor works like new with the screen and cutters.  would recommend these for anyone with a remington razor like this</li>
    <li> Its as good as the original one, that comes with the razor, help you set and gain longer life of the good.</li>
    <li> Obviously fits my Remington MS2 razor fine.  Each set lasts about 1 year, 4 months.  I shave every other day normally, so the price seems reasonable when I catch it on sale!</li>
    <li> Standard replacement for my razor, fits fine, works fine, save over $5 on purchase over brick and mortar stores, when you can even find this!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it and the smooth shave it gives him also pleases me.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and quality is good</li>
    <li> Good product I have purchased these several times for a razor I have had for years. Works great and much cheaper than buying disposable blades.</li>
    <li> Actually I liked the price and the fact I didn&#x27;t have to sort through the choices at the store.It fits my razor and it works. That&#x27;s all I need.</li>
    <li> The reason I bought this product is my trimmer blade went dull.  I was pretty shocked when I received the product to see that it wasn&#x27;t in there.  However, I really can&#x27;t complain because Remington sent me a brand new comprable shaver since they don&#x27;t carry replacement trimmer blades &amp; it was under the warranty period.</li>
    <li> This fits our razor just as advertised.  Highly recommended.  Came fast and we are very happy with it, thank you</li>
    <li> Had a hard time making it fit into the Remington Sp-69 at first but it&#x27;s fine now. when out and brought something like it.</li>
    <li> My razor needed new blades.  I try to change them every 6 months and clean them about once a week and my razor keeps working good.</li>
    <li> This is a good razor; but, the screen gets damaged and when you first notice it is after you have left scratches all over your shaving area...the scratches, however, od heal.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Good service</li>
    <li> It turned it from a device that wanted to cut me back into a fine shaver. I now think it will last forever.</li>
    <li> The new head and cutters have restored the shaver to (nearly) like new performance. Now if only the batteries were easily replaceable.</li>
    <li> Direct replacement for several models of Remmington shavers. I find I need to replace these parts about every six months for a rapid shave. Protect the head in luggage.</li>
    <li> Second time ordering this product. Breathes life into the shaver! I The replacements last almost a year, so I ordered a two pack</li>
    <li> The genuine Remmington  foil does  shave close but it doesn&#x27;t wear as long as I&#x27;d wish. Better than &#x27;aftermarket&#x27; foils.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement part!</li>
    <li> Same quality as the parts that came with the razor..</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased to fine these parts for his Remington razor because this shaver has always shaved better than other shavers he has tried.  The parts fit great!</li>
    <li> If the screen breaks up the best way to go is replacing screen and cutter blades. Instructions come with the parts and&lt;br /&gt;Are easily replaced.&lt;br /&gt;Joe</li>
    <li> I have previously purchased this item from retail stores.  The price form this supplier was much better and the product is exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> I have bought these from the same company and I even bought a shaver for dad.  I am happy to have found this website through amazon to purchase my parts for my shaver.</li>
    <li> Consumer Reports was right about the Remington shaver I bought (MS2-390). It&#x27;s noisy, but it shaves very well and is much less expensive than comparable Braun or Norelco shavers. The replacement foils and blades in particular are significantly less than the replacements for other shavers--about 40% less. In fact, the Remington shaver itself cost me not much more than the replacement heads for the Norelco I had been using.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed, on time</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time and undamaged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Screens are very, very, very thin&lt;br /&gt;Plastic on screens seems a lot thinner and cheaper then the originals that came with my shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost broke the plastic on a screen trying to attach it to the shaver. I had to buy another pair after one of the screens I bought a few months ago somehow punctured and cut my face as I started to shave. The foil on the screens is very very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if these are knock offs or Remington&#x27;s way of &amp;#34;planned obsolescence&amp;#34; to get us to buy a new shaver model with different screens. Either way very unhappy with this purchase :(</li>
    <li> Ordered the replacement head for my shaver and got it 2 days later. Awesome response and was the right part. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find any in stores - sort of like you need to buy a whole new unit when the blades get dull.  This was very convenient.</li>
    <li> After retrieving my unused Remington razor from where it rested for years, I was surprised to find that heads and cutters were still available.  The order from Amazon came quickly as usual and the cutters and heads were a perfect fit.  I discovered the same item at a discount store shortly thereafter but, of course, Amazon&#x27;s price was significantly lower, especially when other needed items brought the total up to qualify for free shipping.  I suspect that the longevity of the product is suspect when Remington suggests proactive replacement in 6 months.  I noticed my old head was torn and I probably had used the unit for less than a year before trying cream and razor again.  But at this point I am very pleased because the product is performing as advertised.</li>
    <li> Well made and the nicely packaged. Easy to replace the old parts and the shaver works like new again. Good buy.</li>
    <li> It was time to replace the screen and blades for my Remington.&lt;br /&gt;The foil screen and blades made my shaver feel &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; again...</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for . It was delivered as promised and the blade was not available in stores.&lt;br /&gt;I will be back to get more soon I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> Remington SP-69 MS2 Foil Screen &amp; Cutter Blade Head worked as well ad the original new components.  Easy way to get the replacement parts at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> Works once we were able to get it on.....no problems at all...Will buy again  when we need too!! We&#x27;re Happy with it</li>
    <li> This is a replacement foil for two shavers I have. The performance of the style of cutter a shaver has seems to be quite subjective as what works for me may not work at all for someone else. This gives me a close shave, works well for me and lasts about a year.</li>
    <li> I have a couple of Remington MS200-series shavers.  One was starting to do a poor job.  I replaced the screen and cutter blade heads, and the shaver now works just fine.</li>
    <li> it wasn&#x27;t damaged when it arrived, and it whas the thing that I ordered. What more could I ask for.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I have been using for years.</li>
    <li> The new blades made my old razor work like it did the day I bought it.  The installation is fairly easy, but make sure to look at the instructions before attempting.</li>
    <li> Great stuff...much easier through Amazon than in the store. It is nice having original equipment to maintain my razor in tip top shape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these, along with &#x27;wet shaving&#x27; gear, for a few years now,&lt;br /&gt; so I think I know how well it *should* work.&lt;br /&gt;I still like it, but it seems the quality control, like almost all products, is history.&lt;br /&gt;I saw another review that stated they were not as sharp as they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really think that was likely, but this purchase mostly confirms it.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t be so negative, but after I changed the cutters &amp; screens, my razor didn&#x27;t seem to shave as well.&lt;br /&gt;So I put the old cutter heads back in, &amp; sure enough, it cuts better with the old heads than with the new.&lt;br /&gt;Just more proof we need The King.</li>
    <li> The parts do just what they&#x27;re supposed to do. Need I say more ?</li>
    <li> These were not repackaged knock offs. They were the same good quality and identical to the original. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The pictured Remington Foil screen and Cutter Blande Heads in the Blue \\&quot;Titanium\\&quot; blister pack arrived exactly as shown in the photo on Amazon.  They fit the shaver perfectly.  Based in reviews noting the foils don&#x27;t last forever, I ordered two sets to take advantage of the free shipping offer (above $25).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M SORRY, BUT THE REPLACEMENT BLADES &amp; SCREEN AREN&#x27;T NEAR AS EFFECTIVE AS THE ORININAL.  IT TAKES TWICE AS LONG TO GET A SMOOTH SHAVE. I THINK THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO INSTALL - DON&#x27;T THINK ONE CAN GO WRONG.  IF SO, LET ME KNOW. BOTTOM LINE - WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH ORIGINAL SHAVER.  GUS</li>
    <li> Amazon delivered this item in no time flat and Remington makes the best razors &amp; replacement kits! Very Happy!</li>
    <li> Replacement parts are working well in my old razor. Although it seems like it&#x27;s taking a little time for my razor to adjust with working like before with these new parts.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised.  Genuine.</li>
    <li> Fit good,got it fast,works great.</li>
    <li> A good interum shaver.</li>
    <li> For whatever reason these blades are no sharper than my year old blades were</li>
    <li> It was exactly as advertised and it worked just fine!  I&#x27;d easily buy another when the need arises, at the same price.</li>
    <li> Screen fits perfect and shaver works like brand new.  And buying off Amazon was the cheapest I could find and was delivered very quickly.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> Seems to work as well as the original that came with the razor.  I seem to be replacing the blade assembly about every 12-18 months, basically whenever I notice that the current blades seem to be dull and not cutting as well as they used to.  It&#x27;s an easy thing to replace, and still far cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> I have difficulty finding Remington replacements at retail stores, but these found these ast a good price point for the same Remington quality replacements I&#x27;ve previously purchased at brick and mortar stores.</li>
    <li> Great blade and foil screen!  Smooth shave!  I&#x27;ve been using Remington for more than 10 years now.  Great electric shaver!</li>
    <li> Fit and work perfectly.  Keeping a 10 YEAR old razer running like new.  Use the special lube to get longer life and closer shave.</li>
    <li> I have use a Remington shaver ever since I can remember, and have always had to replace the heads from time to time.  I usually get  12 -15 months out of a set of foil screen and cutter blade.  I shave every day that I am able and that is most days.  I think it is a good products and plan to keep on using them.  I am 75 if that helps any.</li>
    <li> The Remington electric razors offer a good shave, but the fail screen is a bit fragile and so they do wear out over time and develop cracks that can cut your skin.  However, instead of buying a new razor, you can simply buy new screens and your razor will last for a really long time.  This works well for me.</li>
    <li> Directions aren&#x27;t very good if you haven&#x27;t done this before and I&#x27;m an engineer.  Found a good youtube at[...] that showed how to remove and install screens.  Then it was easy.</li>
    <li> Although my Remington razor was specified by the seller as a model appropriate for the replacements in the package, those elements didn&#x27;t fit. Thus my time and money ware wasted.</li>
    <li> The price was really great and the item was exactly as advertised. I had been looking for this item for sometime, others said their product was correct but when I got them they were not, yours was.  Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Being unable to find these in the store, I turned to Amazon and found them in minutes at a reasonable price. They fit perfectly and work just as well.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t cut any better than the one I been using for 2 years . makes me think it may have been recycled or supposedly resharpened.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these &amp;#34;refills&amp;#34; for years. I just wish the foil screens would last a little longer. But the razor is great.</li>
    <li> Bought these items to replace those I had that had worn out. These fit my razor and I use them every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came in a timely manner and ws what I ordered.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades f/a number of years but am now unable to find them in stores.  Good to have a reliable internet provider around!</li>
    <li> I am using them every day</li>
    <li> Replacement foils and cutter head for my electric razor, exact fit and function, quick delivery, will buy again when they wear out. Remington MS-280 is one of the best electric razors ever made, the battery holds a charge for weeks, the heads last for a very long time and they shave close without burning at all. I have had mine for many years and it still works as if new with these oem parts.</li>
    <li> Could not find a replacement cutter head locally.  This was exactly what he needed.  He is a happy camper as he does not want a new razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the foil and cutting heads. I can understand that they have to be replaced about once every year or so. But I&#x27;m not happy about the built-in battery in the shaver that barely holds a charge even after the shaver has been charging for 24 hours. C&#x27;mon Remngton! I&#x27;m your textbook loyal customer. I&#x27;ve been using your shavers for more than 50 years but lately the quality and durability of your shavers has really deteriorated.  I&#x27;ll be changing to Braun or Panasonic shortly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An explanation or even a half-assed apology would be in order.</li>
    <li> These blades/screens last about a year or less for me. I like them and have no complaints other than I wish they would last longer.</li>
    <li> Yes, and it came sooner then I expected. Very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George.</li>
    <li> The replacement parts are good quality.  Screens are fairly difficult to change out.  More than a 1 minute job if not mechanically inclined.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than buying a new shaver.  The shavers seems to last forever, but the screens eventually need to be replaced because the blades cut through them.  I really like Remington shavers.  Tried others, but Remington always seem to be better.</li>
    <li> Excellent experience, very satisfied.  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Met expectations. Performed as advertised. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> great product and service will buy again</li>
    <li> The product was just as expected and the delivery was very efficient</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.. Just wish they would stay sharp longer....</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 sets.  One works well, the other will not clip into place and falls off the razor.</li>
    <li> Returned as razor quit working</li>
    <li> Not much to say. This product works well, and makes my favorite old Remington shavers (two of them) work like new. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> The foil screen works as expected, and is a good value.</li>
    <li> Very expensive as the shaver can be purchased for about the same price as the foils. Hard to get locally, and they wear out too quick. Apart from all that the shaver does the best shave of all the brands.</li>
    <li> Product exactly as advertised... Fast shipping... Great experience.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a razor that my Dad has and really loves.  It works great, and it was really easy to put on.</li>
    <li> I like the cutting of this cutter blade. It stays sharp for a lot of shaves. I just use water and don&#x27;t get razor burn. It also stays sharp for a lot of shaves.</li>
    <li> These replacement blades are exactly what I was looking for and they are not the easiest things to find either.  They are a little expensive but will last awhile.  Amazon has  great prices.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expect &amp; wanted. I can bearly find these blades in the stores any more. this was a exact fit to my machine.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Remington \\&quot;Titanium\\&quot; with the promise of longer foil life. Well, it doesn&#x27;t seem so. I get about a month per foil. The only good thing is, the replacement foils (SP-69) are fairly cheap, although somewhat hard to find in my area.    This particular foil does give a close shave, however.</li>
    <li> Looked around for these and couldn&#x27;t fund them.  Works great - fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> 1. The Remington Shaver I have used for about a year is very average in many ways. For starter, it does not hold charge well. Frequent charging of the battery is necessary.    2. The worse part is this screen and cutter blade head. It is very difficult to replace the screens. First, the so-called printed direction is very very difficult to read because of the very, very small print. Second, the direction itself is poorly written. Third, the design of the screens is very poor because it is difficult to remove them from the head. Clearly, it is not user friendly!</li>
    <li> I bought this item for a replacement/backup for my remington razor.  I&#x27;ve had remington razor&#x27;s for years and in the past the screen would go bad nicking my face when I shave. I want to be able to replace the screen NOW and not have to go looking for a new one or waiting for delivery.  Hence the backup SP-69.  I&#x27;ve purchased these in the past and have been satisfied.  I see no reason for this one to be different.</li>
    <li> This version of the cutter combo does not shave like older versions.  It seems the cutters do not have the same mesh with the grill.</li>
    <li> It is OK but does not as long as my new Braun shaver</li>
    <li> Very good, a necessary evil to getting a close shave as well as prolonging the life of the shaver itself! Down side is the price....if you where to double the price paid for the kit, you could actually buy a whole new shaver! As with many tech devices these days the monetary logic of some things is totally backwards, but hey, I have a hard time just to seeing a something that&#x27;s still works just for the sake of a few bucks!</li>
    <li> This replacement screen set does work but only after very difficult installation and lubricating the ends so the screens will &amp;#34;float&amp;#34; up and down as they should. When you order I suggest you get two packs one to learn on and the second for actual usage. ALSO, call your order in to Amazon and request they be shipped in a small box and NOT the padded envelope. My first order was completely smashed and unusable. Good luck with yours.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and as shown. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> works good with no problems, delivers a good clean shave.</li>
    <li> made my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; razor new again!!  Very smooth cutting, glides over my face and no nicks!!!</li>
    <li> The replacements blades almost work better than the original. They are definitely cheaper than replacing the entire device and last for a few months, depending on how often you shave.</li>
    <li> Product was blister packed well.  Product came as expected and operates as expected.</li>
    <li> These worked as expected for my titanium razor. If you need replacement blades these will do the trick. The price here on Amazon is half the price in my local store in Canada.</li>
    <li> what is there to say other than it is the replacement part for the Remington shaver, that it arrived in new condition and it works.</li>
    <li> I had ordered two packages of Blades . The Blades were bent in one package but I can still use them. The other package appear to be okay and I haven&#x27;t opened it yet.</li>
    <li> Purchased foil and cutter blade for my husband.  It was impossible to find the parts at local stores and my husband refused to  use his new razor.  Received the items on schedule and glad I thought of Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love these blades and razor.</li>
    <li> Good for the price!  Shave more without scratching your face with some old blades/screens.</li>
    <li> Love my Remington. Have had it for years and replacing the blades and screens make it like new. Be sure to always use the plastic cover for the blades when not in use, the screens tend to break after a decent amount of use. I absolute recommend this and will continue to buy as long as they are available.</li>
    <li> This is exactly the part I needed at a far better price than available in any store.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time but the replacement blades (even though they appear to be an OEM product), are nowhere near as good as the blades that came with the original shaver.  They do not cut worth a darn if you are expecting to remove facial hair.  But, otherwise, they do a pretty good job if you want them to irritate your face.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and expected</li>
    <li> This replacement set gave about one decent shave and then appeared to become dull immediately. Shaver is virtually unusable after 5 shaves. Do not buy this product!</li>
    <li> After I purchased this item, I read the negative reviews with great concern.  They said the blades are bulk, no name replacements that wear out after a couple shaves.  Also they said they are shipped not in the manufacturer plastic as depicted in the product picture.  NOT TRUE.  The blades ARE in the exact packaging as pictured and are the true mfr replacement blades.  My shaver is like new again and the install was a snap.  Thank you Amazon.  After shopping all over town like a dummy, I finally signed up for the Amazon 6 month replacement program and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  IGNORE the negative reviews.  I don&#x27;t know if, in the past, Amazon was shipping bulk knock-offs, but they aren&#x27;t as of this writing.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t last as expected... less than a year</li>
    <li> The product is the same one that I have bought for many years for my electric razor. Less expensive at Amazon than my local retailers around my home, even with shipping costs. Got what I asked for. Will buy the next set this way again.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s electric razor is at least 8 yrs old and never had replacement blades. They were easy to change and he loves it .Just like having a brand new razor!</li>
    <li> These are like the original, and also don&#x27;t last so long (~ 6 mo). I&#x27;ve begun replacing the screens singly (rather than whole set) on the bad side - as the other side can still last some time. Very important to always use &#x27;Lectric Shave&#x27; or similar on your beard, and a lubricant spray on the shaver head; otherwise electric shavers get gummed up and operate poorly.  I&#x27;ve been using these screen type shavers for decades, and have sensitive skin with boar bristle whiskers.</li>
    <li> This item was actually for my father and he was happy for it!.</li>
    <li> Easy installation.  Working well.</li>
    <li> Very good replacement part. Everything fit together and shaves nicely. I would recommend it to anyone not wanting to buy a whole new shaver.</li>
    <li> I signed up to reorder this part every 8 months.  So I am reminded when I should replace the part.</li>
    <li> The screen and cutter head blade were easy to install and make the shaver work like new.  The order was received soon after purchase.  No complaints</li>
    <li> love changing out the blades than buying a new one.</li>
    <li> saved me a fortune in having to but a new shaver, arrived very quickly and perfect for the job.</li>
    <li> DELIVERY WAS QUICK, INSTALLATION WAS QUICK, NO PROBLEM. THE SHAVER IS NOW WORKING FINE.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and the online experience was just like I wanted...fast, efficient, and very effective!</li>
    <li> Easier thsan looking all over town and then paying much more.  I will order from them again if this old razor continues to hold out.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Good price.</li>
    <li> The problem I had with the product was the packaging. They put both blades and cutters in the same little bag. These items can damage one another. So, I won&#x27;t buy this item in the future for this reason.</li>
    <li> The cutter blades are not very durable.  After about 8 or 10 shaves the blades have become  very dull.  This replacement is of very poor quality compared to the orginal equiment.</li>
    <li> After I removed the original blades I noticed that the new blades did not fit as tight on the razor. Every time I clean the blades I have to be very careful not to knock them off the razor!</li>
    <li> For Remington Titanium MS-280 Shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never have time to write reviews, but this is beyond the pale.  Should be minus stars if I could do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sold by Amazon.com.  The cutters and foil came in the Remington packaging as pictured here but when I replaced the old ones (with some difficulty and loose fitting cutters) the shave was even worse, pulling hair and not cutting but more like grinding.  I had to really work at it to eventually get a half-way decent shave.  I noticed that the shavings after cleaning were black instead of the usual light gray my beard has become since entering my late 50s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day someone told me my face looked black.  I looked in the mirror and sure enough my skin was covered with a gray/black residue (not noticeable at first -- looked mostly like a very black shaven beard which I haven&#x27;t had in years), but with black/gray smudges especially in boney spots or where I had pressed harder.  It was difficult to get it all off.  I cleaned the cutters and foil well and oiled them but still get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just now pushed my finger hard on the shaver while it was running and I have a long black smudge on my finger exactly as if I had rubbed graphite powder into it.  I never saw anything like it.  So I looked here and googled around looking for others with the same experience.  I only found one here with a Remington beard trimmer: [...]  (The responses that he pushed too hard is not so!)  This is really weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to sum up the new cutters and foil:&lt;br /&gt;-Difficult to install (but doable with good eyes, mechanical skill and effort)&lt;br /&gt;-Cutters are loose fitting, fall off when trying to clean&lt;br /&gt;-Shave is worse than with my &gt;1-year old cutters and foil&lt;br /&gt;-These cutters and foil leave a gray/black residue on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a $25 Remington travel shaver I got on sale for $5 for now.  It shaves like new (rarely used).  Too late now to return the replacements or I would.  I haven&#x27;t decided yet on what replacements or shaver to get at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/2/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Remington.  The girl asked me if I was taking any new medications or vitamins!  She said sometimes the oils in your skin can react with the nickel in the foils and cutters.  I told her nothing has changed, I&#x27;ve never had the problem before with years of Remingtons and replacements and I&#x27;m using the same style travel shaver now with no problem.  No response on why the cutting is so bad and cutters come off so easily.  She&#x27;s sending me replacements courtesy of Remington.  Hopefully it was just a fluke.</li>
    <li> Not sure why, but this specific razor gives me a faster and notably closer shave than any other electric razor I have tried.  This replacement head replaces the original.  Wish they lasted a bit longer (approx 6-8 mos), but given that there is metal to metal contact that gives you that close shave, its life will be finite.  The better shave is worth it.</li>
    <li> It has been very difficult to locate this particular item, so decided to give Amazon a try.  Are we glad we did!  The item shipped quickly, and when received, it was exactly what we were looking for!  Thanks, Amazon, for having this item on hand...we appreciate it!  Would recommend it to anyone in the market for this Remington product.</li>
    <li> bought and place blades and head on shaver.  Great results.  Shaver works like new. get rEADY TO BUY New head and blades every 6 months</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these twice now and they work great &amp; fit well, just like the original blades/screens that came with the razor.</li>
    <li> Refills worked just like new. They lasted me more than six months but ymmv.</li>
    <li> Cutters pull facial hair rather than cutting it. Have had this problem with other replacemant cutters and blades purchased on the internet for other Remington Shavers</li>
    <li> The cutter blade was easy to install but the screen presented problems.  I&#x27;ve replaced the screen before but this screen (very thin/flimsy)was very difficult to attach.</li>
    <li> Third set I&#x27;ve used in my razor.  Makes the razor cut like new so I can stretch the life of the razor out until the motor dies in the future.</li>
    <li> Excellent product but when ordering always order at least two since the one being replaced could get damaged someone and it would not be good to shave with a damaged screen very hard on the face. Excellent product</li>
    <li> I get a very close shave using these foil shaver heads. I have found them to be quite durable as well.</li>
    <li> pretty good...just like a new razor...the shaver itself is several years old so the new blades are fine</li>
    <li> Low quality screen that wore through after only 1 month.  Remington outsourcing to China for manufacturing cost me.  Maybe its time to find a shaver NOT made in China.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised - good item and seller</li>
    <li> Based on local retail prices, just about all of those listed on Amazon with free shipping are a lower cost.  A win!  Two tips for purchasing replacement foils, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Make certain you buy the correct foils.  The back of my razor shows &amp;#34;SP-69&amp;#34; as being the replacement part for the razor, which I don&#x27;t believe my earlier razors did.  Many of the &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t fit&amp;#34; complaints here on Amazon are due to either ordering the wrong item, or the sellers labeling their product vaguely to where it is unclear what is being ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Buy only new, unopened packages of these foils!  I had purchased one from a third party seller here that claimed these were &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;, only to receive a package in which the plastic clamshell had been opened, and the entire thing had been shrinkwrapped shut again.  Upon opening, I could see that both foils had been creased.  Whether it was in handling when they were repackaged, handling in Amazon&#x27;s warehouse, or damaged by whoever opened this package, the product was compromised.  If a Remington foil is creased, it will weaken and split right along that crease in short order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, that is why I had to replace mine--the protective cover came off in my suitcase, creasing one of the foils when the razor got jammed into something else.  A few weeks later, the constant flexing along the crease caused it to split.  And you usually find out since it feels like someone has raked you across the cheek with a raw piece of metal!</li>
    <li> The product is excellent. Keeps my shaver going for many, many years. I order it on-line because, the ones at the local Wal-Mart are full of used screens and blades. People open them in the store and take the new and put in their old stuff.</li>
    <li> These replacement screens fit newer Remington MS2 which are more durable and give better shaves than earlier models.&lt;br /&gt;Well packaged &amp; quick free delivery (bought 2 sets to get over $25.00).</li>
    <li> Best price,  half of what the box store charge...</li>
    <li> everything was as expected. your service as always extremely efficient. very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Used this replacement for years. It gives me the best shave ever.</li>
    <li> just what i needed. fast shipping</li>
    <li> My husband has been using these for years. It&#x27;s now nice to have them come in the mail! It came when promised.</li>
    <li> my jusband is happy.  Thank you</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to have replacements instead of having to replace the whole shaver.</li>
    <li> I paid more than $200 for my Remington SP-69 MS2 electric razor and thought the razor was finished when the razor head went bad. The foil screen had a tear in it which hurt my face whenever I shaved making my razor useless. I was very happy to find that I could restore my expensive razor easily and cheaply with this kit. The instructions weren&#x27;t good AT ALL explaining how to change out the parts, and the print was so small you practically needed a magnifying glass to read them. It&#x27;s been a while since I changed out these parts, but I think I found a YouTube video that helped me. Even without a video it is a rather easy job if you are patient. No tools are required; all parts simply snap into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have an additional tidbit to share about this razor. I had let mine sit up for several years without using it and had a difficult time re-charging. After 24 hours of charging the battery it still had no life, but I left it connected to power. Then I began seriously searching for information how to buy a replacement battery. Through my Google research I discovered my razor required a battery that had to be soldered into the razor. Arrrrgggghhhh! I really began to think my razor was kaput for sure, but I kept it connected to power hoping it would eventually be reborn. At least three full days later I was about to pitch the razor into the trash, but thought I&#x27;d try one last time to fire it up. VOILA! Happy dance! :-) It worked and is still working! So if anyone else has this same problem, don&#x27;t give up and throw your razor into the trash. Keep charging it for a few days and there is hope it may revive. :-)</li>
    <li> glad i bought it...just like a new one now. shaves close and painless and fast, just like the day i bought it..a long time ago!</li>
    <li> Exactly what the shaver needed.</li>
    <li> I found the process of replacing the screens not the easiest. The picture that is on the replacement package is so small that you need a microscope to see what the steps are all about. You can not purchase the screens without the cutters. I only need screens yet I am forced to purchase the entire cutters and screens for over $25.00 Canadian. If I had done my homework in finding out what the replacement parts cost then I would not have purchased this shaver. I could buy a cheaper throw away shaver at the discount refurbished stores for a lot less and for under $25.00 have gotten a new shaver altogether that I could throw away at a cheaper rate than purchasing replacement parts from Remington.</li>
    <li> Yes but i would like to be able to just buy the foil screens separately too</li>
    <li> No complaints.  Repeat customer says it all.</li>
    <li> Came on schedule and was what I ordered.  I won&#x27;t  install it until my presend cutters and screens wear out.</li>
    <li> this product works great for me.  I like the close shave.  I do have to be careful not to put to much preasure on the foil as it nicks easaly. thank you</li>
    <li> It fit, it works and the price was very good compared to other sellers</li>
    <li> WOW!!! Remington knows what they are doing, best shaver on the planet. I have tried two other name brand and this by far is the best.</li>
    <li> The screen and cutter blade head combination arrived sooner than I thought it would.  I needed only the screen but am glad to have extra cutting blades.  I was somewhat concerned that it would fit because the product number was not exactly the same as my razor, but it fits just fine.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from amazon prime and got it within one day , the product came in the package just as seen in the picture everything was perfect and now my razor works just as good a new , I was little scared though after reading the negative review from back in 2007, I guess a lot of things has changed since then, well anyway I&#x27;m pleased I&#x27;m able to use my razor again without cutting my face, thanks Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> One of the screens was missing the piece of rubber to cushion the screen from the cutter blades making it difficult to use</li>
    <li> good product good shipping</li>
    <li> Product as described.  Good transaction.  Thanks...</li>
    <li> An excellent buy from Amazon.com! A really good price for a truly great product, and it came with free Super Saver shipping!  It shipped quickly and came to me fast.  With new SP-69 screen and cutters I was able to make my favorite razor of all time shave just like new.  Each SP-69 set was brand new and came in it own a store-display type plastic bubble.  My only complaint was that I was limited to buying only 3 sets at a time. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> We have these screens and blade on subscribe and save.  It is perfect, because we get a brand new one right when it is needed.  They come brand new in the package and it is just like getting them at the store, but a lot cheaper.  Great item!</li>
    <li> Purchased the Remington razor several years ago and the replacement foil screen &amp; cutter blade head is difficult to find. The replacement blades are preforming well.  The razor will be kept until the replacement blades can no longer be purchased</li>
    <li> These replacement necessities arrived promptly and allowed me to resume shaving without the pain caused by my worn ones with a minimum of delay!</li>
    <li> good replacement blade choice</li>
    <li> The screen was slight damage to it</li>
    <li> This (Remington 61) shaver is a real very good workhorse,year after year.&lt;br /&gt;A bit loud- but that may help in waking up some of the users !</li>
    <li> screen wears out too fast</li>
    <li> Great shave, nice and close. I have been using this product type for years and always get a close shave</li>
    <li> Blades do not stay in place readily.</li>
    <li> Would prefer the cutters and foils be purchased separately as the cutters need replacing less often than the foils.  As it is it results in an unnecessary expense.</li>
    <li> Despite stating on Amazon that this product is made in the USA, the package states that it&#x27;s made in China.  This is very shameful, especially for the price it costs.  I don&#x27;t mind paying more for helping my fellow country people earn a decent living, but exploiting cheap labor and not passing the savings to the consumer is not cool.</li>
    <li> This item that I purchased for my dad worked very good he was very happy with his razor with new blades</li>
    <li> After a couple of uses the rubber piece on the foil screen broke off.  It is the piece on the side that keeps the foil screen from rubbing on the blade.  I have had this happen before and it allows the foil screen to wear out much faster.</li>
    <li> This shaver head fit my husbands old Remington which made him very happy.  Don&#x27;t throw that old shaver away, just buy a new shaver head.</li>
    <li> The screen is a little difficult to install because you have to be careful not to damage the screen. Once the screens are in, the cutter works great.</li>
    <li> I have this electric razor for a long time and love it. It does what I have been expecting it to do.&lt;br /&gt;The cutter blade and screen work great.</li>
    <li> I choose these because they are the Original Equipment Manufacturer replacement blades so I was confident in their quality and fit.  They work fine and shave nicely.  I signed up for the automatic replacement service where a new set is shipped to me every 6 months and I find that handy.  It&#x27;s nice to just get the new ones in the mail, swap them out and move on.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent replacement.  My shaver now performs as, if not better, than new. I highly recommend Remington.  Buy American!</li>
    <li> razor stopped working after a few weeks...&lt;br /&gt;Turns on and after a few minutes shuts off...even with a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;Was bought as a Christmas gift that don&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;These were not even opened( didn&#x27;t get a chance!)</li>
    <li> my yearly replacement of shaver heads &amp; foil for my old shaver,  best price at time of purchase.  does good job</li>
    <li> Shaves close for an electric. Wears out a little too soon. Cutter blade heads tend to fall off while cleaning. No big deal though.</li>
    <li> Been using Remington shavers for years and needed a replacement screen cutter.</li>
    <li> I own the Remington MS380, and I&#x27;ve had trouble losing the cutters when I go to clean it without watching.  My guess is they designed the friction fit on the cutter support so as to be able to sell more parts in the long run.  A clipping or the old style twist capture cutter design common on the old XLR series I guess didn&#x27;t sell enough parts.  And my method of cleaning probably isn&#x27;t what they had in mind - I just blow the whiskers out into a trash can.  If I&#x27;m not watching, I can lose one of the cutters as I&#x27;m blowing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replacement is the exact part replacement for the cutters and foils.  Function has been exactly the same as the original parts.</li>
    <li> I have this item in auto-ship, and over the years I have received a few sets that seem to get dull much quicker than others.&lt;br /&gt;That is why I rate it a 4.</li>
    <li> I have used my Remington MS2-390 Microscreen shaver for over 4 years, so I have used replacement screens and cutters before. Unfortunately, the quality of the product I received was quite poor. The packaging was as pictured in the product description above, so I have to accept these are genuine OEM parts. After only 6 weeks of use, the foil screens are starting to tear at the ends. I will be sending these back to Remington for replacement. I have never experienced such poor quality from Remington, so I hope this was a fluke. Regardless, I cannot recommend this product at this time.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, what more could you want?  How about letting me get away with a shorter product review, then I wouldn&#x27;t pad it with useless drivel like this!!</li>
    <li> I always keep a spare because you never know when they will go out. Thisisjust what the doctor&lt;br /&gt;Would prescribe.</li>
    <li> WAS WHAT I EXPECTED.WORKS FINE.</li>
    <li> Easy to find on Amazon and a very low price compared to other sites. Will come back to this site when this item is needed again.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced compared to local store and other online vendors for the same thing.  The saver is well designed and does a good job, and glad that I can find replacement parts at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The product is as mentioned, contains the accessories listed and are original. The parts for my machine is accurate shaving.</li>
    <li> not sure what they sent me but it was not the head for my razor.  didn&#x27;t come close to fitting.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, new in pkg.. thank you :)</li>
    <li> These were hard to find, but the ones I did find elsewhere were not the name brand blades and screens.  They came packaged as shown, pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My dad had an older model Remington shaver that needed replacement parts.  He was using another brand of shaver, but didn&#x27;t like it as well.  Now he is pleased to have his Remington back.</li>
    <li> Easy to switch out, works great!  Glad we didn&#x27;t have to buy a new electric razor!  Went ahead and ordered a couple replacements and glad I did.</li>
    <li> Best price.... great fast delivery......item was as described.  My Remington shaver has been discontinued however this cutter and blade head fits perfectly. I have been using the item for 1month no problems......having a clean shave again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item before and had no problems... On my second order the blades didn&#x27;t not fit....  The item was not in the original package...  Soo I&#x27;m not sure what the blade shipped to me goes to????</li>
    <li> New screens and blades sure beats buying a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the good deal&#x27;s !!!</li>
    <li> Makes the old shaver brand new again....</li>
    <li> This was the correct screen and cutter for my shaver. No problems. It takes more work to open the package than to install it.</li>
    <li> Great price, perfect fit.</li>
    <li> An excellent shaving system.  The shaver will probably die before you go through 2 replacements.</li>
    <li> They cut good when new, but the blades dull too fast.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need to pay extra for fancy shavers.  I have the worst thick beard ever and these blades work great.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the purchase and delivery</li>
    <li> My husband ordered this. He said it worked well and was exactly as shown. He was happy to find this on Amazon as he could no longer purchase the replacement locally. He was especially pleased with the pricing. Yes, he would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The corner of the screen was pushed in a little which makes it not work like it should.  Not sure if it was shipping or it was like this already...A little suspect though as the package this comes in is pretty tough and leads me to believe it was like this before shipping as the shipping package is perfectly in tact.</li>
    <li> Replacement cutter and foil sets cost twice as much in the as much as I paid here.  The product I received was as described. It arrived quickly for free shipping.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time, was easy to install and has worked as I expected.  I have been using this item for about 2 months now.</li>
    <li> Great product. Came to us Brand new, packaging not tampered with. This product Works great. It was exactly what we were looking for.</li>
    <li> works in my razor. I bought the &#x27;right&#x27; one!</li>
    <li> Like the foils more than the razor.  Way too loud!</li>
    <li> It has been a very good foil screen and cutter blade head.</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s a perfect replacement. So much easier than trying to find in one of the retail stores.</li>
    <li> Item was as advertised.  Was the exact replacement part needed to repair and allow continued usage of this razor.  If need this part again in the future, will reorder from same.  Price was more than competitive then I found in retail stores.  Free shipping under prime can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these as they were only $14.99, which was $5 cheaper than through Remington.  I could not find them in any stores as it&#x27;s an older model of shaver.  It also arrived on time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a refill and it fit so I am happy.</li>
    <li> works like the old ones</li>
    <li> I have had my Remington razor for about 6 years.  I replace the heads twice a year and the blades once a year.  The razor works as good now as when I bought it.</li>
    <li> good foil screen, would buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing the true Remington shaver foils from Amazon for several years. The original foils seem to be more comfortable and last longer then the aftermarket ones.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I purchased in the past and worked well. Some times buying on-line gets you in trouble cuz it&#x27;s a knock-off - not the case here.</li>
    <li> needed a new foil the razor we had</li>
    <li> Perfect fit. Razor is as good as new!</li>
    <li> The replacement screen and foil work great.  I loved everywhere and could not find them.  I am once again getting a close clean shave.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this same model of electric razor for years.  It&#x27;s the best one they ever made.  I have found that after replacing the foil and cutter blade once, the battery is about done for by then so I just replace the whole thing.</li>
    <li> The screens do wear out and this replacement set is easy to install. I just followed the instructions and the razors shaves like a new one.</li>
    <li> This replacement Foil Screen &amp; Cutter Blade Head are exact Remington products - at Half the price of purchasing just one at a retail outlet.  Great bargain.</li>
    <li> This product was everything I expected.  Arrived in great shape and I am &amp;#34;highly satisfied&amp;#34; with it.</li>
    <li> This is a basic replacement part for my shaver. It installed fine and works fine.  Nuff said. But you wanted 3 more words.</li>
    <li> Husband says the blades are great and everything was shipped so quickly. This is the second time we have ordered this through Amazon and will probably continue to do so.</li>
    <li> It was a good price and works well</li>
    <li> JUST WHAT I DEEDED FOR MY ELECTRIC RAZOR - THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF RAZOR</li>
    <li> Same thing as in the store for much less $$$.&lt;br /&gt;Just follow the instructions.  Getting the new screens in...it&#x27;s a tight fit.  But like the instructions say, get 1 end in first, and the other will pop right in.</li>
    <li> Incredible longevity and a close shave.</li>
    <li> Not much to review. They don&#x27;t sell these in stores and I&#x27;m not about to go buy a new razor every time the screens wear out. Yay.</li>
    <li> I am using Remington MS2 370 along with this Screen and Blades for the last Few Years and they are excellent. Gives me a close shave, without any gel or lube. Bare and clean. I am very satisfied  using Remington products.</li>
    <li> Was happy to find replacement pieces for my razor. I&#x27;ve had the razor itself for several years now and with the replacement cutters and screens it&#x27;s just as good as new each time I change them out.</li>
    <li> These work pretty well, though over the years the quality has slipped a bit and the newer ones are noticeably noisier than the old ones (as in from 5 years ago).  But if you are a fan of the shaver that takes them, you&#x27;ll probably be satisfied with them.  I compared shaving with it to 2 other electric shavers and this one was the best.</li>
    <li> Man did I really need new cutters.  It makes a world of difference.  Just remember to keep them clean!</li>
    <li> This package contains direct replacement foil screen and cutter blades. They are easy to replace and make the razor work like new. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to fix their razor.</li>
    <li> this product gives a good comfortable shave.  The replacement blades and foil fit the original shaver just like the original parts.</li>
    <li> We always keep a spare. Changing regularly keeps the razor working better and the face without nicks. I like having them automatically sent.</li>
    <li> The replacement screen and blades are easy to install. This saves me from having to buy a brand new shaver which would have certainly cost more than this replacement kit. With the new screen and kit, shaving feels a lot more smooth.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Works well.</li>
    <li> It does what it says.  The screens last me 6-9 months.  I usually use a blade 2-3 years with no trouble.</li>
    <li> My husband has used Remington shavers forever and he says they have the closest shave without pulling or burning. I gave one to my son-in-law as a birthday gift and he says the same thing. Neither of them will use any other brand since finding this one. I just keep buying the replacement screen and blade heads and they have lasted years.</li>
    <li> Great price and shipping was right on time too. They came packaged just like the picture. My razor works like a new one again. I would buy again when I need to tune up my razor .</li>
    <li> Great to be able to get all the parts I need right online!</li>
    <li> Great buy ..works just fine</li>
    <li> Awesome product! fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> Good replacement reasonably priced to extend the shaver &#x27;s life. Couldn&#x27;t find this in any store. Saved me a lot of money from buying a new shaver.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. The screen eventually fails, but not too soon if you&#x27;re gentle with it. Shaver is also rather noisey.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!! Purchased in June and already wore through the screens. Original lasted 14 months and my store replacement lasted another year. This product didn&#x27;t even last 5 months. Rip off!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent price for these and quick delivery.  Easy to install in the SP-60 MS2 razor.</li>
    <li> All good. I used to buy this product in stores but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it lately so I turned to Amazon. I found it at a substantial discount, and it works perfectly fine. It is the genuine Remington article.</li>
    <li> Love the difference a new foil makes in shave quality.</li>
    <li> The blades and screen are a perfect match. The razor works just like brand new. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has this razor. Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> I think my Remington shaver may outlast me, and purchasing this replacement package every 18 - 24 months or so when the screen starts tearing keeps it working like new.</li>
    <li> This is a factory replacement part. I saved myself a trip to look for a source for this part now that our local Shaver shop closed. I&#x27;m very pleased with the response.</li>
    <li> better than the original screen and cutter that came with the shaver.  little bit expensive though.  think i am going to get a rotary shaver next time since you don&#x27;t have to use the Remington pre-shave which is really expensive.</li>
    <li> The same model, but older version does not fit this blades. Had no idea that it would be smaller than the shaver I had.</li>
    <li> This works as we expected and was very easy to install.  I can&#x27;t think of anything else relevant to say about it.</li>
    <li> This was factory replacement and came on time and as shown.  Price was half of what i have paid in retail stores.</li>
    <li> nice to be able to find this item  once in the store, is no longer and of course, would need to buy another shaver if couldn&#x27;t find,  so really happy!!!</li>
    <li> as advertised, no issues</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and am very happy. I actually need to order more of these. Sorry it took me so long to post the thanks for this product. I will reorder again this weekend.</li>
    <li> This was very good, the razor was more heavy duty than the ones today. Happy that we found the foil and blades.</li>
    <li> got this for my dad. he loves these, and cannot get them locally. Thanks for stocking this item and at a reasonable price too!</li>
    <li> I rated it a 5 star because I do like it. I just got tired of constantly cutting myself with the worn screen. Now its smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to others because it beats shaving and getting cut by sharp blades all the time. These parts were easy to replace too. It only took a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that you guys carry the replacement head for my razor,  I searched for the replacement everywhere from Target,  Walmart,  Bed Bath my local CVSs&#x27; and a few other spots no one carries it anymore.  Thanks again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time as promised</li>
    <li> This product works just fine with my Remington electric razor. It fits exactly and easily. I have used this head kit twice now which has added many months of life to the main unit.</li>
    <li> Nice product and certainly good design.  However manufacturer should find a way to make last longer.  Only option if you own the razor and expensive.  Just doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
    <li> Was a little bit worried that it wouldn&#x27;t fit my razor model, but it worked great. I was so used to my old dull blades that when I put this new one on it felt like it was just cutting through butter. Have been using it for several months now without issue.</li>
    <li> The replacement parts fit perfectly with my shaver.  I can reuse the existing shaver and don&#x27;t need to buy a new one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this set of screens and heads.  They made my razor new again.  They were moderately easy to change too.</li>
    <li> I bought a new Norelco senso touch.  Did not shave me half as close as me remington so I bought the replacement screen and blades and love them.</li>
    <li> Decent price for factory foil and cutters. 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> This product brought new life to my 250 razor. I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to replace the blades and foil. I will order again sooner than later.</li>
    <li> Work like they should.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for quite a number of years, The foil and screen which I get from Amazon keeps it going. I have had many razors over the years but this one seems to give me the best shave. Amazon seems to be the best price and the delivery is always in a reasonable time.</li>
    <li> Everything was delivered on time and I am pleased that everything works as intended.</li>
    <li> My ten year old shaver finally wore out the foils. This replacement foil/cutter set makes the shaver run like new.  Be patient when installing the foils - they are easily damaged.  Follow the directions and you will have no trouble.</li>
    <li> As with most NEW blades they always feel better than the old tired ones coming off your shaver.  But these blades on my old Remington MS2 -200 beat the shave on my new Braun (which I sent in for repair). I shave faster and closer with my Remington.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a replacement unit for my 15 year old shaver.  It fit perfectly and was delivered on time in good condition.</li>
    <li> these fit and function perfectly. i love this razor, so i was really happy to find replacement parts for it. they dont make electric razors like this anymore, and for the cost of a new razor, these are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they have come packaged in full remington retail packaging every time (i have ordered 3-4 times total) and have fit and worked exactly as they should every time.</li>
    <li> Picking up one of these had been on my list of things to eventually get to for a while...then one of the foils on my MS2-390 tore.  This not only took care of that but the new cutters mean my razor shaves more easily and quickly than it has in a few years.  Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Have had previous remington products in the past.  The brand has always performed well for me in the past.  Will continue to use in the future.</li>
    <li> Like some other brands I&#x27;ve used, these replacements don&#x27;t seem to work as well as the original parts. The original blades didn&#x27;t last very long in the first place and most likely neither will these. That&#x27;s a Remington reality. But at least the originals were sharper longer.&lt;br /&gt;Inserting the new foils takes some manual dexterity because the little rubber gizmos that help hold the foils in place are so cheaply made and a screwdriver is required to push the old foils out the top. Inserting the blades is not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a disappointment because Remington blades are known as the sharpest in the industry but it seems don&#x27;t wear very well.</li>
    <li> I have a rechargeable Remington which uses these and they are getting harder to find.  I like the shaver, and so I bought two even though I have yet to use one in more than a year.  That&#x27;s a vast improvement over the old Remington screens and blades.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product.  I am not pleased that I am required to write more than this.  Good is good and there should me no need to elaborate!!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Exactly what I ordered and needed.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to bring my old razor back to new shaving condition at a reasonable price.  Thanks for carrying this product Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would give this a bad review?  Despite some negativity I ordered the product.  It came exactly as shown in official Remington packaging.  Easy install.  Works like a brand new razor.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my MS2 370</li>
    <li> I really like these blades and screens (razor too).  Good shave and a long lasting product.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The blades and screen are easy to replace and the shaver suddenly works like new again. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> Recieved product very quickly in the mail, and i changed out the blades the very next day with out any issues. My shaver now shaves as NEW! I am very satisfied with product, and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This kit of parts saved my old razor which worked fine only need new screen and sharp blades.  Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to change kit works like new. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> this product is very good , this is a re order for my Dad he had this type of razor that need this cutter  blade head . He wanted me to order it again for he because he like  the last one that  i bought for him .</li>
    <li> good product and fine service, and quick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah</li>
    <li> Super......I mean SUPER fast shipping (one day)!! And very pleased to find these blades and screens! Thought the stores would still carry them because the &amp;#34;micro screen&amp;#34; gives (in my own opinion and over 50 years of shaving experience) the best electric shave ever, but one around here was. New life to an old razor and a smile on this old face. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Perfect, priced right, shipped quickly and was exactly what I was looking for. It installed and works fine, as expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s made my razor system like new.  I used the original blades everyday for over 1 year but decided to order replacements.  Yet. Another good product and fast shipment</li>
    <li> A1. Thanks you very much!</li>
    <li> Razor foils are a pretty standard item if you use that kind of a razor. Purchased on the automatic plan, you get them cheaper. That&#x27;s about it, really. Who&#x27;s to complain?</li>
    <li> I had to go a whole week without my shaver and was glad to see the replacement parts! Installation was a breeze and the shaver works just like it did when I bought it. I&#x27;ll stock up on some more replacements, because I hate to change shavers after your face gets used to a certain brand. Electric shavers used to tear my face to ribbons, but this Remington has been a mans dream...as far as our daily curse of shaving goes.</li>
    <li> Great price for genuine parts, Thanks, Mr. Pete</li>
    <li> I have been a user of Remington shavers, foil cutters and screens for many years.  They went from selling a good shaver for $50.00 a few years ago to $198.00 to $468.00!  I think it was because their MS2-390 shaver became a &amp;#34;Best Buy&#x27; on Consumer report.  And it was a great shaver for $50.00.  It is NOT  a great shaver for $198.00 to $468.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I have NEVER purchased so many Foil Screens for a shaver in my life as I have for this shaver. The metal is so thin and weak that it keeps getting holes worn through the screens from the blades wearing them down from the cutters.  I am really disappointed in Remington after being so loyal to them for over 40 years!</li>
    <li> These last about 6 months or so before I need to replace. Good quality, nice price.</li>
    <li> Brought new life to my old razor. Also much cheaper then exact same kit in local stores.</li>
    <li> The blades do not fit MS100! Be careful when ordering.</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple brands of electric razors, and the Remington gives me the best shaving results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a Norelco last Christmas season, and I liked its quieter electric motor, but the shave quality really diminishes over three&lt;br /&gt;or four months. Advertised cutter replacement is 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although relatively expensive, I will continue to purchase Remington brand electric razors and the replacement Foil Screen and&lt;br /&gt;Cutter Blade Heads.</li>
    <li> The product is what I was looking for and it was shipped quickly. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great money saver - works fine</li>
    <li> Great package buy, especially since all my local stores quit carrying them.</li>
    <li> The Reminton foil screen and cutter blade head is a must to change every six months or so.  The replacement parts work just great.</li>
    <li> Remington says these fit my razor which they did not. Should have bought SP67., Not sellers fault bad advertising by Remington</li>
    <li> Its getting harder and harder to find parts for my aging shaver! This order came quickly and fit perfectly!</li>
    <li> Excellent delivery service and easy to install.</li>
    <li> It was nice to find replacement parts rather than purchase a new razor. The quality and appearance appear to be just like the originals.</li>
    <li> Sweet shave. Glad I bought these. A better price than at the box stores, and the came within days of my order.</li>
    <li> A small piece that holds the blade cartridges in place broke when I was attempting to use it for the first time. I feel like I wasted the money for nothing. I still have a useless shaver.</li>
    <li> I have been having a hard time finding this item in the stores.  So happy I was able to find it here.</li>
    <li> I was a bit nervous and scare after reading negative comments about the replacement blades. But luckily I got good ones and I am happy with the replacement one.</li>
    <li> Replacement cutters and screens are always hard to find in department stores, so I was happy to find the correct part online and for much less than they would go for in a brick and mortar store.  They fit just fine and work just like OEM parts.  I&#x27;ll order them again in the future as well.</li>
    <li> Quality product, would recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a replacement head for my electric razor, the 3rd head, but I&#x27;ve had the razor for quite a while, so it&#x27;s ok.  It arrived on time and I could immediately tell the difference in the quality of the shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement foil screen for Remington electric assort excellent.</li>
    <li> Fit very well. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great!  Get&#x27;s you a very close shave.</li>
    <li> I purchase these ongoing - makes for a new shaver....work very good.</li>
    <li> Works fine, good price.</li>
    <li> Quick and great price</li>
    <li> Great price easy shipping.Quick dealing.saved lots of money today it it is sunny. Today I will go to the store to compare items.</li>
    <li> Good product,  works well and gives a good shave.  Product came within days of ordering.  I would recommend it --</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Good quality and lasts a long time</li>
    <li> Bought these to replace the originals. The originals lasted over a year from light daily use. No change to that and in just a few months the micro screen cracked. I like this shaver for its compact size and quality but not happy with the replacement parts.</li>
    <li> I would be happy to write a review if I did not have to so many words. What can I say, it works.</li>
    <li> This product was just what I needed to improve the performance of my electric shaver.  The foil had become old and dull--much more comfortable now.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores, easily found on this site, after I replaced the heads I still had one that from my last purchase.</li>
    <li> well my sons razor quit working and we thought we would have to trash it instead we looked on amazon found a replacement head now it works great</li>
    <li> Foil screens and cutter blades need to be replaced at intervals for a comfortable shave.  They tend to be overpriced, but are a necessarypurchase from time to time.</li>
    <li> works just like the orginal and so much less expensive than the department stores.</li>
    <li> I got such an amazing price on this item.</li>
    <li> they work well and are exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Like a new shaver again</li>
    <li> Works just fine, (easy to install, etc.) except the razor (Microscreen 930) it is for, in general, does not cut as well as the old XLR-1000 that I used for years and years -- until the battery stopped charging.  (Or maybe my beard is now more wiry than when I was younger.)</li>
    <li> Great product and even greater savings.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband.</li>
    <li> I have two Remington MS2 390 shavers that I have had for years.  I really like them.  The rechargeable batteries don&#x27;t hold a charge very long anymore, so I used them plugged in.  Why not just buy new shavers?  Because they now cost $300 new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using these shavers until they fall apart in my hand.  However, the blades do get dull, and the microscreens do get holes after awhile.  They should be replaced as a set (new blades and microscreen, not just one or the other), so I keep buying this item.  For $20, I get the functionality of a new shaver without having to spend $300.</li>
    <li> Great price...fast shipping</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, value was great deal, worked in razor happy hubby once again</li>
    <li> This item does not fit my model razor even tho the packaging says it does.  Not even close!!!  Manufacturer needs to check this out.</li>
    <li> Quality of the materials is OK, I guess. Ease of installation and instructions to do so however are very poor.</li>
    <li> No problems replacing the old and installing the new screen and heads.</li>
    <li> Easy to install, and fits perfectly. Clearly intended for the razor we have which makes it seem like a new razor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find these replacement blades in the stores locally, so I&#x27;m glad I can get them through Amazon. This was a good price for the product.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for half price!  I couldn&#x27;t believe how expensive these replacement screens and blades are. Through amazon, I got them for half price</li>
