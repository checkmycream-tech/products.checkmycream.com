      <li>I usually like a nail file on my clippers (not found on these clippers), but these cut so cleanly and smoothly, that a nail file is not necessary.</li>

    <li> I really like these clippers. They are a bit firm at first, which can make clipping a bit of a nuisance, but once they loosen up a bit they are fantastic. I was really impressed with how smooth the cut is. I&#x27;ve used clippers in the past that leave my nails with sharp edges thus requiring me to file afterwards. With these, the cuts are always smooth and I haven&#x27;t needed to file my nails afterwards.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s tweezers or nail clippers...if it says Tweezerman on it, it&#x27;s premium quality. Another satisfied purchase!</li>
    <li> Very sharp, very clean cuts</li>
    <li> It broke first time i used it but Amazon gave me a full refund</li>
    <li> Precise and sharp. Easy to use. Better than the $1 store brand that fall apart or cut jagged edges.</li>
    <li> sturdy design and sleek finish. This is my first clipper set. From the looks of it, I believe they will last a long time.</li>
    <li> These clippers are sharp.  My nails are tough and these clippers cut through with no problems.  I usually like a nail file on my clippers (not found on these clippers), but these cut so cleanly and smoothly, that a nail file is not necessary.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re sharp but very uncomfortable in fingers..I should have bought a pair with rubber grips. I would stay away from these unless you have calloused fingers of a lumberjack and will feel no pain.</li>
    <li> I know some reviews gave this a low rating but the ones i got work perfectly...better than the Walgreen&#x27;s cheap maybe they cut, maybe they don&#x27;t&#x27; Chinese jobs by far...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the other reviewer is comparing the clippers to, but I have 5 of these and they&#x27;re the sharpest, highest quality clippers I&#x27;ve ever seen/used.</li>
    <li> The best clippers I have ever owned.  Since no-one else has pointed it out (even though it is clear from the photo) the larger clippers have a completely straight cutting head - it is not curved.  This is life-changing for cutting toenails!</li>
    <li> Received sent back the end...</li>
    <li> They cut my nails which is what they are supposed to do since the are nail clippers. I haven&#x27;t had the edges slip or grind or anything.</li>
    <li> Nice, sturdy and sharp.</li>
    <li> The fingernail clipper broke the first time I used it!  I managed to get it back together, but it&#x27;s definitely going back if it comes apart again..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several different clippers from different stores, and these are easily the best. I have very tough nails, and with many can fight to get them to cut threw a nail cleanly. With the Tweezerman nail clippers this isn&#x27;t a issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not even sure how you would make a pair of clippers even better.</li>
    <li> Nice looking but they could be sharper also they seem to be a little hard to use stiff but there new so maybe the loosen.up but for the price for the two of them it about what you pay at Walgreens or elsewhere</li>
    <li> Very nice set for the price.</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughter and she absolutely loves them! No frills but smooth and easy to use. Just what she likes!</li>
