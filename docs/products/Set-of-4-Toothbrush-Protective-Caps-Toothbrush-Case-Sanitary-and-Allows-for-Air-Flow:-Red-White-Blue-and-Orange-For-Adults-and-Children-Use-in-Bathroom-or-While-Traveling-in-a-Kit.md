      <li>I was very happy to find that these were available on amazon and for a good price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You are better off putting your toothbrush in a zip lock bag!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but they don&#x27;t close on their own.</li>
      <li>I can see that the plastic joint that connects to body to the lid will snap off eventually but because of the cheapness of the product I didn&#x27;t expect anything spectacular.</li>

      <li>Love to have the toothbrushes protected.</li>
      <li>Great item, fast shipping 👍</li>
      <li>that if functioning ok, it seems to be damaged.</li>
      <li>I am a very clean person</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are amazing for those who travel or for me I have a family friend that visits frequently and to have her toothbrush protected is a good feeling.</li>
      <li>This is very useful and handy to keep the toothbrush clean.</li>
      <li>Tooth brushes easily fit inside cap and easy to pull brush out when needed.</li>
      <li>It still serves its purpose so its cheap and fine to buy.</li>
      <li>These are cheap for a reason.  </li>
      <li>Even though it is cheap, I was relying on these for our trip, and they did not satisfy.</li>
      <li>and they fit</li>
      <li>I have been looking for them everywhere and was so excited when I found them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>these are great covers, keeps the tooth brushes from rubbing against each other, easy to put on and the colors are so much fun.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s more to really say?  </li>
      <li>I think I got about a year or two out of the very first one I got like this.</li>
      <li>Easy to open/close and reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I wish these had a better closing mechanism, since they open too easily when traveling.</li>
      <li>These are exactly what I was looking for a clean way to travel with my toothbrush.</li>
      <li>They are wonderful for traveling, it snaps ontop of most sized heads of toothbrushes (mine is awkwardly on the large size) and stays on securely.</li>
      <li>They are useful but not as i was looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So out of the package of 4 maybe 2 will be useful.  </li>
      <li>Good little toothbrush cap, it keep the head clean when not in use and the vent holes keep the brush from getting moldy while in storage,.</li>
      <li>Used very little room in my cosmetics case and kept the brush head nice and clean.</li>
      <li>This is my second time purchasing them I love them so much.</li>
      <li>I imagine they would only fit the most basic, slimmest headed toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>It certainly will evidence inferior products.</li>
      <li>They cost me $4.25 and they are probably worth a little more.</li>
      <li>must say, these are very well made.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Cover doesn&#x27;t stay closed but still works for the most part</li>
      <li>when you have 4, I guess it doesn&#x27;t matter as much.</li>
      <li>Once they arrived, I tried them first and found each one not only pure junk but the lids virtually crumbled on anysize toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Colorful and necessary.</li>
      <li>They were cheap, but basically I paid $4+ for one carrier and will clog the landfill with the other three.</li>
      <li>The previous reviewer may have had a faulty product, mine seem to work just fine.</li>
      <li>Could close a little tighter but they work fine.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s more stable and when the cap opens, less likely to fall out of the case.</li>
      <li>I have an electric toothbrush, these do not fit securely on the brush.  </li>
      <li>As far as size -- they accommodate the medium sized toothbrush head.  </li>
      <li>I looked at several big-chain drugstores as well as the big &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; and could never find exactly what I was looking for.....</li>
      <li>I bought these to replace some older ones that were worn, but I ended up keeping the old ones and throwing 2 (out of 4) of the new ones in the garbage - the snap lids didn&#x27;t stay closed.</li>
      <li>The other two aren&#x27;t consistently locking either.</li>
      <li>They really are what they say they are, not more, not less.</li>

<li> A total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Mds</li>
<li> Total waste of money.</li>
<li> Not much to it, but there doesn&#x27;t need to be.</li>
<li> but it will not stay closed at all.</li>
<li> CAPS DO NOT STAY CLOSED, OVER BRUSH HEADS.</li>
<li> Tops would not stay closed at all.</li>
<li> What is the point of a cover that doesn&#x27;t snap closed?</li>
<li> The &amp;#34;lid&amp;#34; does not snap shut, so if you put your toothbrush in a bag or pocket and carry it somewhere--basically if you do anything other than let it lie still on a flat surface--the cap will pop open and usually fall off.  </li>
<li> They don&#x27;t stay closed and fall off your toothbrush.  </li>
<li> Not very sanitary.</li>
<li> This product meets that goal, but of the package of 4, one lid snaps shut well and tight; two sort of shut -- a bit loosely; and one doesn&#x27;t stay closed at all.  </li>
<li> The quality of these is disappointing, especially given the high average score from reviewers.</li>
<li> These caps work perfectly, no need to get anything more expensive.</li>
<li> My little granddaughter noticed my toothbrush cover and wanted one for her trips to see &amp;#34;family.&amp;#34; Explaining to her the importance of protecting her&#x27;s too, I found this set and ordered them for her.</li>
<li> These did not fit our toothbrushes well.</li>
<li> It works and yes a few of them give a bit of a hassle to close but</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> The locking mechanism on the lid is just a waste.</li>
<li> Dont waste your time or money.</li>
<li> I have an average size toothbrush, but  the 2 that weren&#x27;t broken wouldn&#x27;t stay closed around my toothbrush.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I was a little hesitant at first when I saw the negative reviews but for about $4 it wouldn&#x27;t be that bad of an investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Waste!</li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t have these around, you should, especially during cold and flu season.</li>
<li> Not what I expected very poorly made</li>
<li> I bought these and 2 arrived broken.  </li>
<li> The one complaint from 5 stars is one of the 4 caps was useless, it wouldn&#x27;t snap shut, though</li>
<li> Poor quality.</li>
<li> have some weird toothbrushes</li>
<li> I hate packing my toothbrush because I know germs are going to get all over the bristles.</li>
<li> Worthless, as I see it.  </li>
<li> and I hate when my toothbrush gets all nasty.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
<li> Terrible!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are exactly what I was looking for a clean way to travel with my toothbrush. I am a very clean person and I hate when my toothbrush gets all nasty. until I go these I would just throw out my toothbrush after I took it on a trip. This is my second time purchasing them I love them so much. The only issue I have with them is that I keep loosing them.</li>
    <li> Love to have the toothbrushes protected.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  As advertised.  Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Terrible product... This product cap does not even close. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Used them while traveling in Europe. Used very little room in my cosmetics case and kept the brush head nice and clean. Would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> Cover doesn&#x27;t stay closed but still works for the most part</li>
    <li> Could close a little tighter but they work fine.</li>
    <li> My little granddaughter noticed my toothbrush cover and wanted one for her trips to see &amp;#34;family.&amp;#34; Explaining to her the importance of protecting her&#x27;s too, I found this set and ordered them for her. Once they arrived, I tried them first and found each one not only pure junk but the lids virtually crumbled on anysize toothbrush.  Thank goodness I didnt have them sent to my granddaughter.&lt;br /&gt;Will I return them?  It certainly will evidence inferior products. Dont waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> Got the job done for what I needed at a really good price.  Not much to it, but there doesn&#x27;t need to be.</li>
    <li> Works, but comes open a little easier than I hoped.</li>
    <li> These did not fit our toothbrushes well. I imagine they would only fit the most basic, slimmest headed toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Good little toothbrush cap, it keep the head clean when not in use and the vent holes keep the brush from getting moldy while in storage,.</li>
    <li> These work as you would expect them too. They seam to be well built, and with moderate use I am not worried about the plastic hinge breaking at this time.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but they don&#x27;t close on their own. I need to put paper towel paper in between the cap to keep it closed. It still serves its purpose so its cheap and fine to buy.</li>
    <li> Works great to keep the kids toothbrushes separate and clean on trips.</li>
    <li> I looked at several big-chain drugstores as well as the big &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; and could never find exactly what I was looking for.....Amazon.com to the rescue! These fit perfectly and do exactly what I needed them to do. Easy to open/close and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Great item, fast shipping 👍</li>
    <li> Total junk.  I bought these to replace some older ones that were worn, but I ended up keeping the old ones and throwing 2 (out of 4) of the new ones in the garbage - the snap lids didn&#x27;t stay closed.</li>
    <li> keeps your toothbrush protected while it&#x27;s in your travel bag. I like that it comes in a four pack with different colors.</li>
    <li> Travel a lot -- both business and camping --- wanted something that was slim and space saving.  This product meets that goal, but of the package of 4, one lid snaps shut well and tight; two sort of shut -- a bit loosely; and one doesn&#x27;t stay closed at all.  As far as size -- they accommodate the medium sized toothbrush head.  So out of the package of 4 maybe 2 will be useful.  They were cheap, but basically I paid $4+ for one carrier and will clog the landfill with the other three.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;lid&amp;#34; does not snap shut, so if you put your toothbrush in a bag or pocket and carry it somewhere--basically if you do anything other than let it lie still on a flat surface--the cap will pop open and usually fall off.  Not very sanitary.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected very poorly made</li>
    <li> The locking mechanism on the lid is just a waste. It will never close</li>
    <li> Two of them don&#x27;t close at all. The other two aren&#x27;t consistently locking either. The quality of these is disappointing, especially given the high average score from reviewers. Even though it is cheap, I was relying on these for our trip, and they did not satisfy. We later purchased two travel cases from CVS for the same price and they actually work.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find that these were available on amazon and for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little hesitant at first when I saw the negative reviews but for about $4 it wouldn&#x27;t be that bad of an investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, these are very well made.&lt;br /&gt;I have some weird toothbrushes and they fit perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are amazing for those who travel or for me I have a family friend that visits frequently and to have her toothbrush protected is a good feeling.</li>
    <li> I wish these had a better closing mechanism, since they open too easily when traveling. I ended up stuffing a bit of aluminum foil next to my toothbrush so it&#x27;s more stable and when the cap opens, less likely to fall out of the case.</li>
    <li> What is the point of a cover that doesn&#x27;t snap closed? I wish I could rate 0 stars. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Its just a toothbrush cover.  It does what it is supposed to do, I have no complaints.  Its a good buy.</li>
    <li> CAPS DO NOT STAY CLOSED, OVER BRUSH HEADS. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> I have an electric toothbrush, these do not fit securely on the brush.  They cover it but the cover can not be closed.  It does not provide the protection I want.</li>
    <li> These are great! I have been looking for them everywhere and was so excited when I found them on Amazon. They are wonderful for traveling, it snaps ontop of most sized heads of toothbrushes (mine is awkwardly on the large size) and stays on securely. The previous reviewer may have had a faulty product, mine seem to work just fine.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these in the local store and can&#x27;t find anymore.  This is very useful and handy to keep the toothbrush clean.</li>
    <li> Simply the best caps out there, fantastic colors, and they ship with prime!! Now I can keep my tooth brush anywhere</li>
    <li> these protective caps for the toothbrush works. I had no problems with them. I didn&#x27;t purchase these on here but in a local dollar store. I will be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> They work as advertised. Tooth brushes easily fit inside cap and easy to pull brush out when needed. Would purchase again if needed.</li>
    <li> These are horrible. I have intended to use them for my son&#x27;s toothbrushes, but they won&#x27;t even keep the toothbrush in. I try to close it but it will not stay closed at all. It is not just one of them but it is a problem with all four, therefore I cannot even use them. Waste of money. Please do better research.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy them, they don&#x27;t lock (click) closed.</li>
    <li> They are toothbrush caps. I can see that the plastic joint that connects to body to the lid will snap off eventually but because of the cheapness of the product I didn&#x27;t expect anything spectacular. It works for its purpose and thats all that matters.</li>
    <li> I hate packing my toothbrush because I know germs are going to get all over the bristles. This thing is perfect.</li>
    <li> They cost me $4.25 and they are probably worth a little more. They really are what they say they are, not more, not less.</li>
    <li> It protects my toothbrush during travel.  What&#x27;s more to really say?  The one complaint from 5 stars is one of the 4 caps was useless, it wouldn&#x27;t snap shut, though when you have 4, I guess it doesn&#x27;t matter as much.</li>
    <li> Terrible!  I bought these and 2 arrived broken.  I have an average size toothbrush, but  the 2 that weren&#x27;t broken wouldn&#x27;t stay closed around my toothbrush.  Waste!</li>
    <li> Perfect for travelling and every day use at this price.  They will not last forever...I think I got about a year or two out of the very first one I got like this.</li>
    <li> We use these to cover our toothbrushes when traveling.  They are great because your toothbrush head stays protected while in your travel bag.  Keeps it nice and clean!</li>
    <li> It works and yes a few of them give a bit of a hassle to close but what the heck. It still covers your toothbrush and protects it from germs. So it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> these are great covers, keeps the tooth brushes from rubbing against each other, easy to put on and the colors are so much fun. stay on too, even when traveling [shaking around] these are great protectors. great buy for the 4 you receive.</li>
    <li> These are cheap for a reason.  They don&#x27;t stay closed and fall off your toothbrush.  Worthless, as I see it.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> They are useful but not as i was looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have 2 of them that if functioning ok, it seems to be damaged.</li>
    <li> The latch doesn&#x27;t keep the toothbrush in the case.  I would not recommend this product.  You are better off putting your toothbrush in a zip lock bag!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have these around, you should, especially during cold and flu season. Sensible and simple. Colorful and necessary.</li>
    <li> Used for a couple of years for travel - hardly something I think much about but served it&#x27;s purpose!</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Had to throw two of them away when we opened the package. Tops would not stay closed at all. A total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Mds</li>
    <li> These caps work perfectly, no need to get anything more expensive. They don&#x27;t fall off during travel at all. Good product.</li>
