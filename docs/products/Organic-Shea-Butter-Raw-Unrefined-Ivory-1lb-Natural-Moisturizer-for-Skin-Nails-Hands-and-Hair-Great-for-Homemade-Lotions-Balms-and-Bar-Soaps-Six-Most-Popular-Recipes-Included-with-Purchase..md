<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> To my surprise the container of shea butter was very large. The recipes which are provided are great, and I was quickly able to whip up the foot scrub and the lip balm. The foot scrub left my feet so soft and silky and the lip balm, with the added peppermint essential oil, is so fresh on the lips. I plan on making more of the recipes and giving them as gifts, especially since it is all organic.</li>
    <li> My heels were really rough and I have been using this shea butter for almost 10 days now and they are so much smoother and the cracks have almost completely healed already. Love the recipes that came with this product, a really nice bonus. Will definitely buy it again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I use this unrefined raw shea butter on my face. It leaves my skin so soft, fades dark spots and wrinkles. I am sensitive to many perfumes and lotions. I used expensive creams. I developed a red, itchy skin because of strong chemicals. Within a few months using this organic shea butter, I have noticed difference in my skin. It has totally transformed my skin. It keeps my skin hydrated and moisturized. I finally feel like my healthy skin has return. Love this fantastic moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is totally worth every penny! You never know what exactly they put in the lotions/creams at the store - but this shea butter is totally natural and organic, and IT IS AMAZING! So much better than lotion and even other shea butter type products I&#x27;ve purchased. This is the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit of this goes a long way. You don&#x27;t need heaps of it to heal/cure your dry skin. Just a dab spreads wonderfully and hydrates fully without being greasy/oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this shea butter! Buy it and see the difference for yourself!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love!  Use this product on my dry hands and belly through pregnancy.  Keeps my skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service and I brought this for my fiancee and she loves it and has helped her skin a lot, excellent quality for the minimal chemicals in there and love the fact it is organic</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product for moisturizing. You will need to add essential oils to make it smell better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a huge tub of shea butter. I like using it on areas like elbows and feet before bed. I also tried only a dab on my hair because my hair is mostly gray and course. I used a small amount on the underside of my hair, then brushed it through, even a dab was too much but i&#x27;ll experiment again. It is a nice moisturizing treatment for my type of hair.</li>
    <li> Natural and versatile moisturizer for soft skin and superior homemade products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Effective. I have these terrible cuticles/hangnails. Health and a well-kept appearance are an important part of my profession so I have been fighting with them for a long time. This shea butter has been a life saver. I know confidently use my hands to show consumers various things and I am so grateful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Versatile. You can use this shea butter to make everything. I use essential oils for aromatherapy and natural remedies and now have a collection of essential oil body butters and lip balms. Look for recipes on pinterest and/or head to the positive naturals website for awesome tips and recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Amazing value. One pound is a lot of shea butter. I have saved so much money by making my own (chemical free) products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review and am happy I can sincerely recommend it to all of you. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This butter really helps with the smoothness and  texture of my skin. It feels great and I can have peace of mind knowing I&#x27;m not sticking garbage perservatives in my body.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:562fc19315844eb29fb29c3704fa3d9f]]Organic shea butter, raw unrefined ivory 1lb; natural moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth your having to make multiple using from it , either keep in the reclosable container or simply put in several  separated storing.

    <li> I love this organic Shea butter! I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable improvement in my skin since I&#x27;ve started using it. My skin is so soft and smooth. It&#x27;s also great on those rougher areas, like my knees and elbows. I use it daily and would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Positive Naturals really cares about happy customers! They solved a minor issue with me immediately and extremely courteously. Also, their Shea butter is awesome! I used their recipe to make my own body lotion, and it&#x27;s made my skin softer than imaginable. This is a product and company I am excited to tell others about!</li>
    <li> This is my first time to try shea butter.  It comes in a 1lb container.  The shea butter is thic, ivory colored cream and can be easily applied to skin.  After application, initially the skin looks very shiny and oily, but once the shea butter is absorbed, the skin is very soft and less shiny.  It has some mild scent, which I&#x27;m not familiar at all, but it smells original unlikely chemically added fragrance. After couple of days of using this shea butter on my arms and hands, I still couldn&#x27;t get used to the small, so I mainly use it to moisturize my legs and heels.  This shea butter moisturize my skin great and I truly like it; however, I need a little bit more time to get used to the raw smell.</li>
    <li> Organic Shea Butter is fabulous. It&#x27;s soft and absorb&#x27;s easily, I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Shea Butter worked very well and my skin is much less dry and peeling.</li>
    <li> This brand of Shea butter is great.I have used it on my body and feet.Not greasy at all.Today I will be trying it on my hair and scap. I have found a good product, will buy again!!</li>
    <li> My shea butter arrived the other day. I have a business and use shea butter in some of my products. I just used this shea butter to make my lip balm, coconut lemongrass, and it came out wonderful! I would recommend this shea butter without hesitation. The shea butter has nice texture, and is fresh looking. Definitely worth the purchase</li>
    <li> OMG!  Where has this product been in all my life.  I ordered this Organic Shea Butter, because I have dry skin and so does my husband.  I decided to get this one, because I have heard shea butter is really good and I am into organic products, so this was the prefect choice.  Packaging is great and the recipes are really amazing!  I mean you get recipes for deodorant, lip balm, sugar scrub and even shaving cream, just to name a few!  So those are just pluses.  My experience with this butter has been nothing, but great!  It really is just like butter...scoop a little in your hand and rub it between your palms to melt it.  I have to say my skin has never felt so luxurious as it has with this butter.  My husband is in love with it too and we both feel great using it knowing that we are putting organic butter on our skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;m 6 months pregnant and I use this all over my body. It does it job. Would buy again</li>
    <li> I really like the fact that this is organic and no nasties. I can be allergic to many ingredients but I feel confident to buy and use this</li>
    <li> Good quality item, well-priced. Works well to moisturize skin. A little goes a long way.Recommended.</li>
    <li> Really nice quality shea butter. I recently started making my own body butter with the recipes I found on a few blogs. I added lavender to one and a combination of lavender and eucalyptus oil for another. Even using the shea butter alone makes my skin feel moisturized but not greasy. I can&#x27;t really compare this product to others since the ones I&#x27;ve had were processed and had other things added to them, but this feels like it&#x27;s a good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the consistency of this shea butter, it is so easy to apply and really moisturizing. A big plus as well is that it is organic and unrefined. The benefits of shea butter are endless.</li>
    <li> This is the original shea butter..I know because I am from Africa</li>
    <li> I only use organic products and this is by far one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.  I love Shea Butter and when this arrived I was extremely pleased with the quality!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this product. My husband bought it for me and I could not be happier with the way my skin feels. I highly recommend this to anyone who has dry and cracked skin. This stuff is the real deal.</li>
    <li> First time trying Shea Butter.  It does moisturize well and I am very pleased.  I will warn, apparently raw shea butter has a very distinct smell.  It isn&#x27;t pleasant but does fade.  Also oils can be mixed in to make it smell amazing.</li>
    <li> Great product, mix with my favorite oils. Recipes com with it.</li>
    <li> Great quality Shea butter without the nutty smell! I highly recommend for the price!</li>
    <li> I am so happy to get this shea butter. I think natural and organic product is the way to go especially using it on human body. I find some recipe to make my own lotion and some rub on the chest to sooth the coughing and breathing. The result is amazing. I have been using the lotion with this shea butter in, my skin is hydrated and smooth. The rub that I make smells great and helps a lot when I have breathing problem.&lt;br /&gt;I think this shea butter is great value. A lot of shea butter in this 1 lb jar, and the quality is divined.&lt;br /&gt;I got it at discount in exchange for an honest review. Great shea butter, organic and all natural. I love it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this shea butter! Your skin is your body&#x27;s largest organ and what you put on your body is as important as what you put in your body. I love the fact that this is organic and unrefined, which makes it safe for me and my family. It works great for my body wash recipes and straight out of the jar. I&#x27;m five days in to the 10 day heel challenge and I can already notice a big difference. I only wish I would have started at the beginning of the summer so my feet were pool ready much earlier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried about ordering a product like this online because you never know how well it is packed and if the lid will stay on. I didn&#x27;t want a gooey mess in the shipping box. Well, this came perfectly intact. The lid is well designed so I don&#x27;t end up with shea butter all over the bottle like I do with another brand of coconut oil I use.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product.  I like that it&#x27;s organic.  A little goes a long way when you rub it on your skin. Makes my skin feels soft. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very happy to discover this product.  I work with paper and fiber and my fingertips and cuticles dry out and crack frequently - with only a week I&#x27;m seeing a difference with a daily application of shea butter.  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying some of the recipes on their website as well to make up gifts for friends and family.</li>
    <li> To my surprise, this much anticipated jar of shea butter arrived before the delivery date. Thanks to the care of packaging, it was well protected and in perfect condition.  The recipes were sent by email and I have found that the recommended uses will benefit me and my family, tremendously.  I immediately used it to relieve my younger son&#x27;s eczema breakout.  The lip balm is great for the prompt soothing and softening effects. My mother has dry, brittle nails and I usually have a problem with hangnails. After just a week and a half of use, the conditioning properties have made a world of difference. I intend to implement the shea butter recipes for my hair and skincare regimen as well. This is truly a superior quality product and I don&#x27;t doubt that I will be ordering additional tubs for myself and as gifts that I believe will be much appreciated.</li>
    <li> I Love this Shea Butter! Very creamy and moisturizing. Great for dry skin. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is very thick, but what a difference it&#x27;s made with my skin. It makes it incredibly soft, for days if I don&#x27;t reapply each day.  I will be ordering another jar soon.  It is not scented, I often will put some essential oil in it as I apply for additional smell and benefit.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I purchased this shea butter! One pound is going to last me a long time. A little product goes a long way. I love that this shea butter is organic. This product is great on my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Really awesome, cant wait to get more!</li>
    <li> very happy to find organic shea butter that I can add my young living essential oils to and make my own lotions and body bars.</li>
    <li> Using an all-natural product, with minimal ingredients, and free of preservatives and other toxic chemicals is of prime importance to me, and that&#x27;s why I ordered this shea butter. I love the list of recipes that the seller sent to me, and can&#x27;t wait to try them out. Already after a couple of days of using the raw shea butter, my skin and nails are feeling and looking so much healthier.</li>
    <li> I have been making creams, lotions and potions for over a decade and Shea Butter is one of my favorite ingredients. It can be used in so many ways for skin, hair, lips, baby products; the unrefined Shea Butter has even been known to help with arthritis and stiff joints when applied topically. It&#x27;s packed full of vitamins including A &amp; E well known to be beneficial for skin. It makes a great hair masks and works as a pomade, too. If you make soap, it&#x27;s one of the best ingredients you can use~! But one of my favorite uses for this is right out of the jar for my lips &#x3D;) Fabulous stuff~! Thank you~!</li>
