      <li>I love his product and was happy to find it again...</li>
      <li>This concealer pencil has a nice creamy consistency and is fairly opaque to cover &amp; blend</li>
      <li>This is a good buy, and can be used at your makeup table, or easily carried in a purse.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Wonderful item, I will be buying more like it in the future.  </li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This is a favorite standby for me, and has been for years.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Do make sure you purchase the correct shade for your skin, and also purchase the item with the sharpener.</li>
      <li>This is one of my can&#x27;t do without makeup tools :)</li>
      <li>This product provides excellent coverage and is easy to apply....but it has pink hues that didn&#x27;t blend with my tan skin color as well as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>Not too sticky, not too dry, not too creamy, it&#x27;s just perfect for hiding any imperfection.</li>
      <li>and though I can&#x27;t use this one much, I would recommend it if you can manage to find a good color for your skin.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, and easy to carry.</li>
      <li>I is easy to apply exactly where you want it because is is a creamy pencil.  </li>
      <li>I first saw this pencil at a indoor flea market.</li>
      <li>First one we received, no pen just the box and sharpener.....</li>
      <li>I ordered it in my favorite shade and, as always, it did an outstanding job of covering undereye circles and other facial blemishes.  </li>
      <li>Had to order a second and all was fine....</li>
      <li>might as well buy a crappy and cheap foundation from the drug store and you would get the same results.</li>
      <li>keep in mind that if you are porcelain to medium light, you are likely to prefer the lightest shade of this.  </li>
      <li>What is helpful is that it stays put all day, especially if you lightly powder over</li>
      <li>The seller was very prompt.</li>
      <li>It blends very well into the skin.  </li>
      <li>I kept thinking I could live without it; I suppose I could, but it really is one of those items I&#x27;d rather not do without!</li>
      <li>It is the only make of facial pencil that actually stays on and looks natural.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, even though I ordered the second lightest shade (Pure Beige), it is quite dark and seems better suited to a tan or maybe olive complexion.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It works wonders on my face! Not too sticky, not too dry, not too creamy, it&#x27;s just perfect for hiding any imperfection.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a so so  product.  You can tell you have it on if you look closely.</li>
    <li> Let me just say that I am fond of pencil concealers as they are versatile and travel-friendly. This concealer pencil has a nice creamy consistency and is fairly opaque to cover &amp; blend well.  Unfortunately, even though I ordered the second lightest shade (Pure Beige), it is quite dark and seems better suited to a tan or maybe olive complexion.  It is quite pricey for a slim pencil so receiving the wrong shade was very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So keep in mind that if you are porcelain to medium light, you are likely to prefer the lightest shade of this.  That said, I do like it overall and though I can&#x27;t use this one much, I would recommend it if you can manage to find a good color for your skin.</li>
    <li> I first saw this pencil at a indoor flea market. They had different colors so I had to see which one matches my skin complexion. The color I bought was perfect. It covers sun spots, beauty marks, and anything else I want to conceal. Then I saw it on Amazon and ordered it, knowing the color. If you don&#x27;t know the skin color to buy, you probably are taking a chance.</li>
    <li> This is a great pencil and one that I would recommend to any woman! I keep one with me at all times! The one I hae now is a small nub and I have had it for at least 7 years!!! So, I am buying another because of that. I kept thinking I could live without it; I suppose I could, but it really is one of those items I&#x27;d rather not do without!</li>
    <li> Wonderful item, I will be buying more like it in the future.  The product was as expected and was as advertized.</li>

    <li> This is one of my can&#x27;t do without makeup tools :)</li>
    <li> This pencil delivers as advertised.  It blends very well into the skin.  I use it to cover spider veins on my legs and it does reduce their appearance.</li>
    <li> Disappointing.  Doesn&#x27;t cover well, might as well buy a crappy and cheap foundation from the drug store and you would get the same results.</li>
    <li> I love his product and was happy to find it again...but it should have bees shipped along with the other pencil I purchased...and due to the size of my order I should not have had to pay any shipping fee!..at least this is what I was lead to believe throughout the ordering process!</li>
    <li> First one we received, no pen just the box and sharpener.....Had to order a second and all was fine....</li>
    <li> This product came in just a couple of days. I love how it covers my many flaws, and it blends well with my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ised this pencil a long time. Love it. Lasts all day. The seller was very prompt.</li>

    <li> This is about my fourth time ordering it. I love it.</li>
