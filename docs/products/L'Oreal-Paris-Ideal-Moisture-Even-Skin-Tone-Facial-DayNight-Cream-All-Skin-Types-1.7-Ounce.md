      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>For me, the cream is an excellent night time moisturizer.</li>
      <li>how wonderful my face looks/feels in the morning.</li>
      <li>This is the best all around face cream I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>and this is a perfect balance of adding moisture without feeling oily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy that my baby-brain messed up for me</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve just had a very pleasant experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so incredibly lightweight that I think it will be perfect for summer.</li>

      <li>, L&#x27;Oreal Paris Ideal Moisture is my dream</li>
      <li>Good luck to you!</li>
      <li>However, this one has not clogged my pores, which makes it perfect good for acne-prone skin.</li>
      <li>Great moisturizer to use at night or during the day when not going out onto the sun.  </li>
      <li>Would be great</li>
      <li>This cream is great  </li>
      <li>The Ideal Moisture line has day lotions with SPF, but they aren&#x27;t as good as this.</li>
      <li>Great smell</li>
      <li>Fantastic moisturizer!!!</li>
      <li>, love it!!</li>
      <li>I had thought that if this had sunscreen it would be perfect, but based on the fact that the sunscreen in their day lotions is what makes me not like them, I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t because that would ruin</li>
      <li>Good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>NOT soothing at all nor is it good for the skin.</li>
      <li>I know L&#x27;OREAL has good products and have never had an issue before.</li>
      <li>I love Loreal&#x27;s Ideal Moisture</li>
      <li>The smell is good, I saw people complain about the smell</li>
      <li>Was trying not to spend $100+ for a good skin cream, but</li>
      <li>This is a nice lightweight cream, that is quite effective in smoothing out your skintone!  </li>
      <li>Very light and silky face cream, has a great feel.</li>
      <li>any rate, this cream also has a very pleasant (and light) rose scent - like rose water.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>The moisture in this product is amazing.</li>
      <li>cream is amazing.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>It has a nice scent, too.</li>
      <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think this product was going to work</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight and works wonderfully under makeup.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
      <li>Smells can overwhelm me but this is very nice and light.</li>
      <li>Super great at mosterizing.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it feels light and smells good</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I do feel that there are better creams out there, this is a wonderful option as far as drug store creams go.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this cream, it is light and absorbs well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and non-greasy on my face.</li>
      <li>it smells so good, feels cool and refreshing on my skin, and leaves it feeling hydrated and supple.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update in 2 more weeks to see if my skin tone has changed.</li>
      <li>That would explain why my pores look better after just a two weeks.</li>
      <li>but I have found this one to work better.  </li>
      <li>I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because I noticed on another website that many people were complaining of the scent</li>
      <li>The cream is a lovely lavender shade and goes on so silkily.</li>
      <li>Waited a month before reviewing this :3</li>
      <li>Not the best moisturizer out there, but it definitely helps even out skin tone.</li>
      <li>My words don&#x27;t do it justice, just try it. :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products and I&#x27;m so pleased with the results here.</li>
      <li>There is a scent, but I really LOVE the scent.</li>
      <li>glad I found it here.</li>
      <li>Smell is light, goes on nice.</li>
      <li>Non greasy and soaks into my skin, leaving my face more supple and even toned.</li>
      <li>love this and can&#x27;t find it in any stores anymore.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad amazon carries it.</li>
      <li>I also love it because it is in a jar which is easier to get all the product out of.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve fallen in love with this product.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This product smells better than the lotion from many lines.</li>
      <li>I love the way my skin looks now</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>It surely is working like it should.  </li>
      <li>glad I could find it</li>
      <li>It is a very clean product that moisturizes and brightens skin without any residue or greasy look.</li>
      <li>I like this face cream, it has a nice texture and absorbs quickly without feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>my skin is not as healthy looking and does not feel comfortable.</li>
      <li>come true and is definitely the perfect match for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the smell, it has a rose scent and it really does moisturize my skin and make it glow.</li>
      <li>moisturizer does have a fragrance to it, but it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
      <li>Ugh I LOVE the smell of this stuff and its so creamy and dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t make you feel oily or anything.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been putting a makeup primer on over it to help seal it in and noticing a huge difference.</li>
      <li>and I did see a huge improvement to my skin in just a month.</li>
      <li>I had a huge baby-brain-fart when I went in and somehow managed to confuse Olay and L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s almost where I can feel comfortable going out without makeup.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin and supposedly it&#x27;s a oil free moisturizer but not too me.</li>
      <li>I prefer an oil free because I have combination skin - and what I was looking for was something promoting an even tone.</li>
      <li>The light texture of this disappears into my skin, and the texture has improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Has made my skin feel super smooth.</li>
      <li>The best basic moisturizer for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>This is an overall good face lotion.</li>
      <li>if they made this product with at least spf 20, then it would be perfect to use in the daytime.</li>
      <li>The light fragrance is very pleasing and not too strong.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t take care of it while pregnant and have been struggling to find balance with it in the six months since I had my daughter.</li>
      <li>I will it came in a bigger container, because I am going to be needing some more of it for sure.</li>
      <li>moisturiser is lightweight but moisturising enough for both day &amp; night, and most importantly, it blends and gets absorb into my skin almost immediately!</li>
      <li>My skin is SOOOO freaking smooth and even texture and just overall AMAZING.</li>
      <li>I figure if I start now, I will (hopefully) be able to keep my decent skin for a while</li>
      <li>It is absorbed so quickly.</li>
      <li>Besides the minor inconvenience of using more face powder, I absolutely love this cream.</li>
      <li>and I was very surprised but pleased.</li>
      <li>Love it because it always leaves my skin super soft and moistured.</li>
      <li>My skin is very dry so any help to keep the moisture replenished is a good thing.</li>
      <li>If I put makeup over it, I look shiny after a couple of hours, so I have to reapply powder more frequently.</li>
      <li>I guess Lancome Absolue is worth it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Super great at mosterizing. Will keep purchasing, Amazon is the only place it isn&#x27;t sold out</li>
    <li> This cream is great  it leaves you face soft and supple. It spreads easily and only  small amounts needed when you apply it.</li>
    <li> I live in Chicago. Winter is harsh and it leaves behind a very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Advantages:&lt;br /&gt;1. Non oily.&lt;br /&gt;2. Smoothes the skin.&lt;br /&gt;3. Can be applied to sensitine skin.&lt;br /&gt;4. Smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantage:&lt;br /&gt;1. Your skin starts to feel dry after 2-3 hrs of application. (may vary the result because I live in a cold place)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly gave 3 stars as I have to apply this product every 3 hrs.</li>
    <li> I saw a lot of reviews by customers saying they noticed a change in color and brightness and I was hoping this could help with discoloration and evening out my skin tone overall.  It seems more like something that affects the texture vs the color, because the first two days of use, I didn&#x27;t notice anything, but after day three, I began to break out with a few tiny pimples, above my lip and on my chin. I also developed a sandpaper-y rash on my neck that was pink and itchy. I would say that I have sensitive combination (sometimes oily, sometimes dry) skin, but have never had reactions to even non-mild products before, and I never break out except a few days before my period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The L&#x27;OREAL Youth Code day/night cream and the L&#x27;OREAL Collagen Moisture Filler day/night cream did not have this effect on my skin, and I&#x27;ve used both in the past. I know L&#x27;OREAL has good products and have never had an issue before. I stopped using this cream a couple of days ago and my face seems to have calmed down a bit, but I cannot go without moisturizer, so I&#x27;ll go back to Youth Code and the Collagen cream, but not this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just FYI, I don&#x27;t wear anything on my skin (like makeup) except moisturizer. And I wash with L&#x27;OREAL 360 Clean in the shower every other day (I have dry skin) and water on the off days, and also use L&#x27;OREAL Plenitude HydraFresh Toner.</li>
    <li> leaves skin soft and moist but not greasy.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer - I would definitely give this product a 5 star any day, but the box in which contained the moisturiser wasn&#x27;t sealed and was all torn and tattered. Therefore the low rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being an extremely lazy woman in her 30s who is blessed with combination, sensitive &amp; acne prone skin, finding the right moisturiser for all seasons, day &amp; night can be a tedious job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, L&#x27;Oreal Paris Ideal Moisture is my dream come true and is definitely the perfect match for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturiser is lightweight but moisturising enough for both day &amp; night, and most importantly, it blends and gets absorb into my skin almost immediately! I swear my skin is less dull in just one application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I hope the company will look into the packaging. No one likes their purchase to be already open before arriving in their home.</li>
    <li> I like the L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Works great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Does wonders for my skin and actually does increase the evenness in my skin tone. I use this every night and every morning. Smells decent too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve fallen in love with this product. It surely is working like it should.  I would recommend it to friends and family. I love the way my skin looks now, it&#x27;s almost where I can feel comfortable going out without makeup. I love it.</li>
    <li> After a month or so I noticed a brightness in my skin I hadn&#x27;t seen before. Love it!</li>
    <li> I prefer an oil free because I have combination skin - and what I was looking for was something promoting an even tone. The light texture of this disappears into my skin, and the texture has improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do pair this up with Watt&#x27;s hyaluronic acid - just a few weeks of both of these products has improved my skin by years!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for a couple of weeks now. It definitely feels nicer than most lotions - it absorbs into my skin instead of feeling like a film over it. I have gigantic pores that you can see from across the room, but I&#x27;ve already noticed an improvement in pore size and skin texture. If I put makeup over it, I look shiny after a couple of hours, so I have to reapply powder more frequently. I think it may be because this cream keeps my pores open, so the oil comes out instead of staying trapped deep in my skin. That would explain why my pores look better after just a two weeks. Besides the minor inconvenience of using more face powder, I absolutely love this cream.</li>
    <li> The moisture in this product is amazing. I know that people have complained about the smell but, if you have acne then you just have to deal with it beggars can&#x27;t be choosers. This product smells better than the lotion from many lines. It make my skin smooth no new breakouts or anything. I loooooooooooove this cream. I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer to use at night or during the day when not going out onto the sun.  Would be great if they made this product with at least spf 20, then it would be perfect to use in the daytime. I love the smell, it has a rose scent and it really does moisturize my skin and make it glow. It feels like my face drank a big glass of water.  It&#x27;s hard to find in stores and I&#x27;m glad amazon carries it. Haven&#x27;t seen any changes in skin tone yet and have been using it for a year.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it feels light and smells good but unfortunately my skin just was not compatible and it broke me out like crazy. I have very sensitive skin so I thought I would take a chance and try it. Good luck to you!</li>
    <li> I just recently bought this as the other cream I was looking for was out of stock; and I am IN LOVE. I noticeably saw a difference in skin texture as well as my discoloration VERY SOON after purchase. I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because I noticed on another website that many people were complaining of the scent, I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that bad and am very happy I decided to purchase it. I only use it at night, but am thinking of using it in the morning too.</li>
    <li> This works very well. It leaves the skin feeling soft and not greasy. Four of us with different skin types tried it and it seems to work well for all of us.</li>
    <li> I used this product every morning and night. It is a very clean product that moisturizes and brightens skin without any residue or greasy look. It is absorbed so quickly. When using this cream my skin was soft and more even toned . I switched to target my wrinkles that I did not feel were being addressed with this cream .I am going back to this cream as now I realize without it my skin is not as healthy looking and does not feel comfortable. Other creams that are more expensive and meant to target more mature skin don&#x27;t have anything better than this cream in my experience. The creams with retinol a seem to have so many fillers that make skin look more aged and greasy. Maybe perscription retinol a alone under this would work out.</li>
    <li> love this and can&#x27;t find it in any stores anymore.  glad I could find it</li>
    <li> What a difference this moisturizer has made on my skin in just one week! When my husbands notices and gives me a compliment, I know the product is working because he&#x27;s not very observant when it comes to that sort of thing. However, he noticed that my skin looked better than usual within one week of use, so I couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer does have a fragrance to it, but it&#x27;s not too strong. It&#x27;s hard to describe; it&#x27;s kind of floral. Between the fragrance, the jar, the color of the moisturizer, and the texture, I feel so luxurious when putting it on! I&#x27;ve just had a very pleasant experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has helped to brighten my complexion, lighten dark spots, and keeps my skin moisturized. I always have issues with products clogging my pores, which makes me leery when purchasing skincare products. However, this one has not clogged my pores, which makes it perfect good for acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> It looks smooth but when you put it on it feels a little gritty on the skin. So far I haven&#x27;t seen any results. I will probably not purchase this again, I will stick to my Olay active hydrating cream.</li>
    <li> Fantastic moisturizer!!!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this is a perfect balance of adding moisture without feeling oily.  Couldn&#x27;t find it at the drugstore anymore, glad I found it here.</li>
    <li> This is an overall good face lotion. It&#x27;s not greasy at all. It works for morning and night. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores. I have no complaints!</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin or are acne prone, I highly recommend trying this product. I purchased it about two months ago and never turned back (to Olay, my former go-to moisturizer). The formula is light and has been improving my old scares. There is a scent, but I really LOVE the scent. (Perhaps it has just grown on me?) I&#x27;ve tried so many products and I&#x27;m so pleased with the results here. You can wear it under makeup or alone. Sometimes I&#x27;ll mix a tiny dot of Evening Primrose oil into it at night if I want an extra glow. My words don&#x27;t do it justice, just try it. :)</li>
    <li> Great smell and I did see a huge improvement to my skin in just a month. The issue is the jar is tiny AND on top of that you don&#x27;t get much in it.</li>
    <li> I like this face cream, it has a nice texture and absorbs quickly without feeling greasy. It has a nice scent, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with uneven skin texture for I have no idea how long. I&#x27;ve used everything and tried everything to smooth out my skin so that my makeup goes on without dry patches in random places. I&#x27;ve used this for 2 days and my skin is tremendously different! I honestly didn&#x27;t think this product was going to work but I figure, why not try anyways. My skin is SOOOO freaking smooth and even texture and just overall AMAZING. Did I mention the smell? Ugh I LOVE the smell of this stuff and its so creamy and dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t make you feel oily or anything. If you are struggling with uneven texture I seriously recommend this product cause in just a couple days you will see a difference, at least I def did. Will DEF be rebuying!</li>
    <li> Very light and silky face cream, has a great feel. I purchase this from Amazon because it is hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> This is a nice lightweight cream, that is quite effective in smoothing out your skintone!  The price is also quite low, for this type of product!</li>
    <li> I love Loreal&#x27;s Ideal Moisture Even Skin Tone Moisturizer - it smells so good, feels cool and refreshing on my skin, and leaves it feeling hydrated and supple. My only complaint is - I think I got ripped off. My jar I purchased from Amazon was only half full. I want to buy it again, but if that is really the normal amount that comes in the jar, it is way too little. For this reason I will not be repurchasing it.</li>
    <li> This was ok, but I am not nearly as impressed as the other reviewers. It is sufficient to keep my skin from getting too dry and flaky, but it really doesn&#x27;t feel super moisturized or make it look all that much better than with anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying a L&#x27;Oreal product and I like it. It&#x27;s very light and non-greasy on my face. My skin is very dry so any help to keep the moisture replenished is a good thing.</li>
    <li> Does not work as stated leaves purple spots on skin, does not mosturize enought, nothing like usual loreal quality products, did request a refund on this product did send it back over 2 weeks ago still have not get a refund back.  Very dissatisfied with this product and seller customer service.</li>
    <li> I switch from Olay to this product. It was a big mistake. I&#x27;m an adult and I don&#x27;t typically have any blemishes. My face began breaking out in tiny pimples. It was not an allergic reaction, instead it was just acne. I thought maybe it was something else and wanted to test it so I took a break from the moisturizer and then return to again after my face cleared up. This product definitely causes breakout of tiny little pimples all over my face. It definitely clogs pores. I haven&#x27;t had temples in response to any other products and would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference and I used this item for over 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer. No sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love it because it always leaves my skin super soft and moistured.</li>
    <li> This is the best all around face cream I&#x27;ve ever used! Non greasy and soaks into my skin, leaving my face more supple and even toned. Can be worn alone or under makeup. Affordable &amp; works well!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this cream, it is light and absorbs well. The light fragrance is very pleasing and not too strong. A little goes a long way. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I feel like I wear less makeup because of it! Has made my skin feel super smooth. Not the best moisturizer out there, but it definitely helps even out skin tone. Waited a month before reviewing this :3</li>
    <li> For me, the cream is an excellent night time moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been almost 2 weeks using this product and I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my face. It&#x27;s suppose to help with your skin tone. The smell is good, I saw people complain about the smell but I didn&#x27;t think it was bad. Really moisturizes your face, maybe too much for me. I have oily skin and supposedly it&#x27;s a oil free moisturizer but not too me. I&#x27;ll update in 2 more weeks to see if my skin tone has changed.</li>
    <li> I have fairly sensitive skin on my face.  Not SUPER sensitive, but enough that I look for moisturizers for sensitive skin.  This one burns when I put it on.  It also always leaves a gritty feel on my skin for some reason.  Was trying not to spend $100+ for a good skin cream, but I guess Lancome Absolue is worth it.</li>
    <li> Expired product!  It causes a reaction on my skin, and also when you try to rub it in it starts feeling gritty then pieces start peeling off.  NOT soothing at all nor is it good for the skin.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel nice and soft but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and greasy.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know that a cream could do this. After using this cream for only 3 days, I had an attractive, straight, physician that I have worked with a while come up to me and actually tell me that my skin was glowing. This is not an exaggeration. GLOWING. That is a direct quote. I am only 30 years old, but I noticed a slight discoloration around my eyes from years of the sun starting to show through. I also have a bit more discoloration from previous acne as well. Overall, I would say my skin is average. Not too bad, but not exceptional. However, this cream is definitely making a difference. I figure if I start now, I will (hopefully) be able to keep my decent skin for a while longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, as a bonus, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be breaking me out like the Olay 7-in-1 did. I liked that cream, but it gave me little white heads. I guess it was clogging my pores a bit. Which, is too bad, because it has a nice feel otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, this cream also has a very pleasant (and light) rose scent - like rose water. I will it came in a bigger container, because I am going to be needing some more of it for sure. It&#x27;s a definite repeat purchase item.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It keeps my skin moist and glowing (must be the tourmaline!).  I&#x27;ve used more expensive skin products but I have found this one to work better.  It does have a fragrance but after using it for several weeks I now like the fragrance a lot (usually I avoid perfumed products).  I use it morning and evening and have stopped wearing foundation all together.</li>
    <li> The best basic moisturizer for sensitive skin.  No break -outs, love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It started working from day 1 and I was very surprised but pleased. I noticed a difference in my skin texture right away. I also love it because it is in a jar which is easier to get all the product out of. I also love that it has very little smell. Smells can overwhelm me but this is very nice and light. Verified purchase has been removed from this review, but I did pay for it. I only clipped a coupon that was available at the time of purchase. I only got a small discount and paid the rest. This is my honest opinion and I was not given the coupon for it, it is my opinion only.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to re-heal my skin after having a baby and dealing with the hormone changes that brings about. I had been wanting to find a new dry skin/anti aging preventative routine that could be done with products found at a drug store. I know it&#x27;s possible, it just takes more effort and trial and error. I had a huge baby-brain-fart when I went in and somehow managed to confuse Olay and L&#x27;Oreal. I didn&#x27;t stop to think about the price difference from what I was expecting to pay, I just tossed it in my basket and went about my business. I&#x27;m very happy that my baby-brain messed up for me here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is amazing. I am shocked that a $6 cream can be this brilliant. I have combination/extra dry skin that is currently in horrible shape. I didn&#x27;t take care of it while pregnant and have been struggling to find balance with it in the six months since I had my daughter. I am currently messing it up more by working to remove my blackheads, reduce the appearance/size of my pores, and smooth my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect any of the results from this cream that I got. The cream is a lovely lavender shade and goes on so silkily. The surface of my face was left feeling soft and noticably smooth. That smoothness will last 4-5 hours on it&#x27;s own. I&#x27;ve been putting a makeup primer on over it to help seal it in and noticing a huge difference. My face feels softer, smoother, and just glows. I put it on with a jojoba oil at night and am shocked by how wonderful my face looks/feels in the morning. It&#x27;s very lightweight and works wonderfully under makeup. The Ideal Moisture line has day lotions with SPF, but they aren&#x27;t as good as this. I had thought that if this had sunscreen it would be perfect, but based on the fact that the sunscreen in their day lotions is what makes me not like them, I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t because that would ruin it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do feel that there are better creams out there, this is a wonderful option as far as drug store creams go. I would usually choose a cream by Garnier, Aveeno, Simple brand, or CereVe, but I think this has become my new favorite cheap cream. While I will probably still go in and buy the Olay I meant to, I will rebuy this and potentially use it as a summer cream. It&#x27;s so incredibly lightweight that I think it will be perfect for summer. It&#x27;s not quite moisturizing enough on my extra dry skin (hench the jojoba oil) to use it as an all the time cream.ld usually choose a cream by Garnier, Aveeno, Simple brand, or CereVe, but I think this has become my new favorite cheap cream.

    <li> This Product burns my skin. Moreover after a while It looks like you put plenty of oil on your skin</li>
    <li> Bought this at my local drugstore. Smell is light, goes on nice. Not greasy. However after it sets, if you rub or touch your face, it rolls off like dead skin and doesn&#x27;t absorb.</li>
    <li> I just finished one so I purchased the same one, as I like the texture of it, and how it feels on my face and I am in my mid 30s with combo skin</li>
