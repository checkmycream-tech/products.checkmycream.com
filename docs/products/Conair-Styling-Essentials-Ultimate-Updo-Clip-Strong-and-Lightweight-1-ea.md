      <li>So glad I found it it here!</li>
      <li>I love this!  </li>
      <li>I love this clip!  </li>
      <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get it to work.</li>
      <li>Now they stay on their own.    </li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t figure out the best way to use it for it to stay in my hair.  </li>
      <li>it is very strong.</li>
      <li>works great, light weight, strong.</li>
      <li>I wear my hair up every day now, which is great for hot, humid weather.  </li>
      <li>Service was great too..received the product really fast...would recommend to anyone.</li>
      <li>luck! :)</li>
      <li>I used metallic clips and wooden clips, but this one is the best.</li>
      <li>On top of that, it hurts my scalp every time I try to use it...</li>
      <li>Wish more colors</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve glad I got it.</li>
      <li>Wish I had purchased more.</li>
      <li>I have lost all of them and was upset not to be able to find them in the stores.  </li>
      <li>The best part is being able to take my hair down, re-comb and easily put up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it stays all day long (you may have to redo the bun for the perfect position) and the little bent over part is perfect for tucking in the ends of my hair.</li>
      <li>The pin is STRONG yet flexible and has this hook or fold-over on the top which is very helpful in catching the ends your hair.  </li>
      <li>easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is so easy.</li>
      <li>Takes my tangled mess and makes it easy to manage AND looks great!  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair, but lots of it</li>
      <li>i can even sleep with it in and it looks fine in the morning.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t hold in my fine, but plentiful shoulder-length hair.  </li>
      <li>I have too much hair for this to really work, but it would be great for people with a medium amount of hair.</li>
      <li>I weave it in and out of the twist and the hair against my head and it stays secure.</li>
      <li>This pin is fabulous.</li>
      <li>The ends are tapered and curved so as to smoothly slide through your updo and securely hold your style.  </li>
      <li>Voila, secure all day, and you can&#x27;t even feel that it&#x27;s there.  </li>
      <li>Creating a perfect sleek look takes a bit of practice --- just getting my hair out of my face at home is almost mindless.  </li>
      <li>I love that they are not plastic but Carbon, very solid and good for the environment.</li>
      <li>I originally found this in a drugstore.</li>
      <li>In fact, I had a couple since I love it so much.  </li>
      <li>They are light weight, they hold hair quite securely, and they have a nice balance of strength and flexibility that makes them more comfortable than most other options, especially if like me you have a LOT of hair to pin up.</li>
      <li>Amazed that I got it so quickly.  </li>
      <li>I bought one piece about 3 month ago at Raley&#x27;s (grocery store), love it, but when got back for more-</li>
      <li>Take the clip and poke it into the top of the bun/French twist you have just made, at a perpendicular angle, to secure it into the hair next to your head.  </li>
      <li>And has no metal or wood , no fear to make it wet, Good for to the beach or pool.</li>
      <li>It takes me 2 seconds to create a bun or  French twist kind of updos , and it holds it all day and</li>
      <li>You do have to put it in just right</li>
      <li>It is kind of strange looking.    </li>
      <li>I have very long, fine hair and this clip holds my hair up comfortably all day</li>
      <li>But this is not product related:)</li>
      <li>I wish the packaging gave more direction on proper use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s flexible enough not to stick into your scalp, but strong to hold your hair.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>but you can&#x27;t really see much of it anyway.</li>
      <li>Really bummed</li>
      <li>The clip is easy to use and holds my long hair up for hours.</li>
      <li>The funny little knob at the top holds pieces of hair in that I am always putting hairpins into.</li>
      <li>The top part that would hang over the hair, is hidden.  </li>
      <li>This is useful for more that just a french twist - do a half pony and stick it through the bottom</li>
      <li>My problem is that I am having trouble finding more.</li>
      <li>This is strong enough to keep it up and very simple to use.</li>
      <li>and this is the ONLY clip of this type that doesn&#x27;t slip right out.</li>
      <li>only problem with them is that I loose them all the time :)</li>
      <li>After trial and error with several other types of updo clips, I ended up buying the &amp;#34;Good Hair Days prong chignon&amp;#34;, and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love these updo clips far above any other product I have used to hold up a bun.</li>
      <li>For my straight, slippery hair that is not thick and shoulder length, this ultimate undo clip was not for me.</li>
      <li>Does not work if you have soft straight hair, simply does not stay in place, neither the hair nor the pin</li>
      <li>I have slightly coarse hair below my shoulders, but not by much longer.</li>
      <li>I got one of these years ago at a drug store, used it regularly, it has not broken yet and since I have never seen it in a store again</li>
      <li>I twist my hair into a bun or french twist, insert the pin and am ready to walk out the door in two minutes.  </li>
      <li>I think it would work even better for thick hair.</li>
      <li>I am amazed how easy to use this little thing !</li>
      <li>This is the only clip I have ever used where I have been able to put my thin, fine hair into a french twist and have it stay all day long.  </li>
      <li>The clip itself is very sturdy yet flexible enough at the same time.</li>
      <li>I am buying second one just in case I might loose my first one.</li>
      <li>I have a huge head of thick curls</li>
      <li>I have no trouble in concealing the pin in the upswept mass of hair, though this could be because my hair is long and there is a lot of it.  </li>
      <li>It is a decent alternative to some of the other methods I use to put my hair up.</li>
      <li>Start with a mid pony tail, twist up, tuck the twisted pony tail at the top back down and hide under the first part of the twist.  </li>
      <li>My hair is almost down to my thighs and wavy, so I bagan using two on one bun; although one clip worked fine until my hair got past my waist.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this!  2 seconds to an up-do.</li>
    <li> This pin is fabulous. You can achieve several different updo styles by twisting your hair and inserting the pin in different ways.  I have long (mid-way down my back) hair and have used all kinds of pins and clips and bands.  I generally wear my hair up for everyday.  This is my go-to pin.  I twist my hair into a bun or french twist, insert the pin and am ready to walk out the door in two minutes.  The pin is STRONG yet flexible and has this hook or fold-over on the top which is very helpful in catching the ends your hair.  The ends are tapered and curved so as to smoothly slide through your updo and securely hold your style.  I have no trouble in concealing the pin in the upswept mass of hair, though this could be because my hair is long and there is a lot of it.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this on clearance at a drug store.  I finally pulled it out to use it.  I love it!  It&#x27;s not pretty - but it&#x27;s not really visible in my hair.  This is the only clip I have ever used where I have been able to put my thin, fine hair into a french twist and have it stay all day long.  The top part that would hang over the hair, is hidden.  I weave it in and out of the twist and the hair against my head and it stays secure.</li>
    <li> easy to use once you get the hang of it. works great, light weight, strong. stays in. i can even sleep with it in and it looks fine in the morning.</li>
    <li> this is the easiest bun pin I have ever used in my life. it stays all day long (you may have to redo the bun for the perfect position) and the little bent over part is perfect for tucking in the ends of my hair. flexible yet sturdy. throwing my hair up has never been quicker. yay!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hold in my fine, but plentiful shoulder-length hair.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> I love this clip!  I have thick curly, curly hair.  This is strong enough to keep it up and very simple to use.</li>
    <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get it to work.</li>
    <li> this holds great in my waist length fine hair! Took me a few tries to figure out.. But it&#x27;s great for a quick do!!</li>
    <li> I originally found this in a drugstore. I had never seen one before. It is kind of strange looking.    At almost 4 inches long it works like a charm. After you make your twist, slide it in underneath and rotate it up, slide the prongs down through the twist. I have slightly coarse hair below my shoulders, but not by much longer. Everything I was using to get my hair up was giving me a headache.     Made out of carbon fiber, this \\&quot;clip\\&quot; is lightweight and holds well. It does not seem to press against my scalp like other designs do. The funny little knob at the top holds pieces of hair in that I am always putting hairpins into. Now they stay on their own.    My problem is that I am having trouble finding more. I bought the last one in the store. I wish they made them in different colors although I would rather have it in black than not at all.</li>
    <li> Takes my tangled mess and makes it easy to manage AND looks great!  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have too much hair for this to really work, but it would be great for people with a medium amount of hair.</li>
    <li> Did not think this would work on my waist length thick hair but it did! And without tangling or causing headache.</li>
    <li> I will try to upload a pic. I love these updo clips far above any other product I have used to hold up a bun. I was not able to find them anymore anywhere else I looked beside here on Amazon. My hair is almost down to my thighs and wavy, so I bagan using two on one bun; although one clip worked fine until my hair got past my waist. And they do not seem to break, even after daily use for 5 years.</li>
    <li> I had bought this in a store.  In fact, I had a couple since I love it so much.  I have lost all of them and was upset not to be able to find them in the stores.  The clip is easy to use and holds my long hair up for hours.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a little over a month since I&#x27;ve bought this online and I still haven&#x27;t figured it out. I tried youtube tutorials, and even had it in for work one day but it hurt too bad so I had to take it out. :( Really bummed</li>
    <li> This is the best hair clip EVER!!! I just lost mine on an airplane and have been distraught ever since. I have fine hair, but lots of it and this is the ONLY clip of this type that doesn&#x27;t slip right out. SOOO VERY HAPPY to have found it here!</li>
    <li> I got one of these years ago at a drug store, used it regularly, it has not broken yet and since I have never seen it in a store again I found it on AZ and bought a half-dozen.  They are light weight, they hold hair quite securely, and they have a nice balance of strength and flexibility that makes them more comfortable than most other options, especially if like me you have a LOT of hair to pin up.</li>
    <li> For my straight, slippery hair that is not thick and shoulder length, this ultimate undo clip was not for me. I will probably  donate it to a yard sale or charity or give it to someone with long, thick or curly hair. I didn&#x27;t have enough hair or the length for it to work.</li>
    <li> Love this clip....easy to use and holds hair great.. Service was great too..received the product really fast...would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder-length, medium-thick hair and the clip wouldn&#x27;t stay in place.  I tried it out for days and gave up.  I&#x27;m using spin pins instead.</li>
    <li> This Conair thing does NOT work. I have long hair, mid chest length, and fairly thick.  This Conair clip slips out of my hair EVERY time, and is difficult to use. Makes sloppy updo&#x27;s that don&#x27;t stay put. Do not buy this piece of crap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After trial and error with several other types of updo clips, I ended up buying the &amp;#34;Good Hair Days prong chignon&amp;#34;, and I love it. It works perfectly every time, makes beautiful no-slip updo&#x27;s and buns, and is self-explanatory to use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00H5BCPF0/ref&#x3D;yo_ii_img&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck! :)</li>
    <li> Amazed that I got it so quickly.  I have a huge head of thick curls and I never thought it would hold but it&#x27;s wonderful.  I don&#x27;t feel like I have something ripping my scalp. Wish I had purchased more.</li>
    <li> The clip itself is very sturdy yet flexible enough at the same time. The instructions could have well been written in another language because the instructions are so vague that I had to figure out how to use the clip for myself. All in all, I&#x27;ve glad I got it. It really secures my hair in place all day, and I have very long, thin hair. I think it would work even better for thick hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian with very, very thick &amp; a bit curly hair. The description is not adequate so I had to look up on the Internet, I watched some videos about this clip, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to hold my hair.</li>
    <li> This little guy has changed my life!  I wear my hair up every day now, which is great for hot, humid weather.  Start with a mid pony tail, twist up, tuck the twisted pony tail at the top back down and hide under the first part of the twist.  Take the clip and poke it into the top of the bun/French twist you have just made, at a perpendicular angle, to secure it into the hair next to your head.  Then tilt the clip up and push it down through the twist, close to your head.  Voila, secure all day, and you can&#x27;t even feel that it&#x27;s there.  My hair is a bit past shoulder length.  I dry my roots and leave the ends of my hair damp; this seems to help the updo stay put.</li>
    <li> Love it!! I have 4 and I leave them everywhere. They hold very good. I have a lot of hair, very heavy and no problem. I love that they are not plastic but Carbon, very solid and good for the environment. They only bad thing is I lose them!!</li>
    <li> My hair is just way to thin and slippery for this product to stay in my hair. It would great for medium thickness.</li>
    <li> I used metallic clips and wooden clips, but this one is the best. It&#x27;s flexible enough not to stick into your scalp, but strong to hold your hair.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with them is that I loose them all the time :) But this is not product related:)</li>
    <li> I bought one piece about 3 month ago at Raley&#x27;s (grocery store), love it, but when got back for more- it was gone. So glad I found it it here!</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t figure out the best way to use it for it to stay in my hair.  I wish the packaging gave more direction on proper use.  On top of that, it hurts my scalp every time I try to use it...seriously scratches it almost every time I try!  Not sure what the issue is, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to make this work for me!</li>
    <li> I have lots of fine, stubborn hair -- straight with an unpredictable wave --- that is difficult to control.  A sleek french twist was something I dreamed of -- one without the butterfly clips seemed impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so easy. Creating a perfect sleek look takes a bit of practice --- just getting my hair out of my face at home is almost mindless.  The best part is being able to take my hair down, re-comb and easily put up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No bobby pins, no hair spray -- just a good twist.  Great!</li>
    <li> I am buying second one just in case I might loose my first one. I am amazed how easy to use this little thing ! It takes me 2 seconds to create a bun or  French twist kind of updos , and it holds it all day and it is very strong. And has no metal or wood , no fear to make it wet, Good for to the beach or pool. Wish more colors but you can&#x27;t really see much of it anyway. Great item!</li>
    <li> I have very long, fine hair and this clip holds my hair up comfortably all day - I can&#x27;t even tell its there.</li>
    <li> This updo clip worked for me but it did not stay through a morning of gardening.  You do have to put it in just right or it won&#x27;t stay in.  It is a decent alternative to some of the other methods I use to put my hair up.</li>
    <li> Does not work if you have soft straight hair, simply does not stay in place, neither the hair nor the pin</li>
    <li> This is useful for more that just a french twist - do a half pony and stick it through the bottom and you have a messy bun that stays!</li>
