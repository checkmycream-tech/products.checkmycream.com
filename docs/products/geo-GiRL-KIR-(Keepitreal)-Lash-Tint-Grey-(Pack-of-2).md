### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>SO happy to have found this product!</li>
      <li>But I ordered the gray, and it works great!</li>
      <li>The brows look just great!!</li>
      <li>GREAT!</li>
      <li>Best I can tell, lash TINTs</li>
      <li>this works great.</li>
      <li>Great consistency.</li>
      <li>my hair is gray &amp; if it had darkened more, it would have been perfect...</li>
      <li>so I feel good about using it on my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Great buildable coverage if you want to reapply throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic ingredients I would feel safe sleeping in, or eating! :)</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This is a great mascara if you are looking something that is light.  </li>
      <li>Well, actually neutrogena lash tint was the best mascara ever, but since that has been discontinued, this is the closet thing I could find.  </li>
      <li>I would buy again &amp; again :)</li>
      <li>It is okay on my brows</li>
      <li>but I have another product I like better for brows.  </li>
      <li>product gives my light eyelashes nice color with no added volume or gook.  </li>
      <li>My daughter and I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>so I am glad to have found this product on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I like lash tint better than mascara</li>
      <li>I cannot wear most mascara&#x27;s because they flake off almost immediately leaving me with not-so-attractive racoon</li>
      <li>but I found that  it comes off too easily and ends up under my lower lashes.</li>
      <li>This tint is easily removable (I always use Bioderma micellar water for makeup removal).</li>
      <li>I was a huge fan of Neutrogena Lash Tint which has been discontinued.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Seems to me that a lot of girls and women would want a lash tint, instead of the always-clumpy-and-often-severe mascaras that are available.</li>
      <li>I use a brown eye shadow on my lids, and sometimes a light application of brown liner.</li>
      <li>I also thought it would be more permanent but it comes right off with makeup wipes.  </li>
      <li>It was just right and went on easily (</li>
      <li>I like this geo GIRL product so much that I ordered two more packages immediately.</li>
      <li>satisfactory product that is economical, easy to use, and the right color for me.  </li>
      <li>It was reasonably priced and arrived very quick.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
      <li>I think you can do better as far</li>
      <li>The soft color is perfect for my pale skin and silver hair.</li>
      <li>So all one needs is to give it a little body warmth (ar body-warm water bath for a short time), and it works perfectly!</li>
      <li>Worked perfect for a natural look by making my my long blonde lashes visible but not &amp;#34;made up.&amp;#34; No raccoon eyes.</li>
      <li>i like the product very much</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>With all this brown, the gray actually might work better than the brown for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like the light, natural, no smudge look</li>
      <li>About my daughter, she&#x27;s a redhead and all mascaras are too heavy for her fair skin and lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this tint, I am using it very often instead of regular mascara.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for nice, natural color.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this lash tint, my lashes have been long and healthy.  </li>
      <li>stuff comes off easily with water - no eye makeup remover required (so no tugging at your lashes, which potentially rips them out).</li>
      <li>Washed off so easily with soap &amp; water with no left over gunk or staining.</li>
      <li>I work from home, but I still want to look pretty everyday, so I wear organic/mineral makeup on everyday basis, and this tint is a perfect addition to my routine.</li>
      <li>It is good and hardly clumps.</li>
      <li>well it&#x27;s really just color.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really help the squishiness.</li>
      <li>I like the color of the product so much and can&#x27;t find the color anywhere else,</li>
      <li>I really wanted the brown lash tint.</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
      <li>Do not buy if you want your lashes to really pop.</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara...</li>
      <li>I expected a whole lot more color and definition from this product on my lashes.  </li>
      <li>First I was sceptical after reading most of the reviews but since this was the only grey tint I gave it a try.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had silver hair for many years and dark lashes and brows.</li>
      <li>Hands down, my FAVORITE beauty product.</li>
      <li>This stuff is so runny that it pukes out of the top and has to be rinsed down the drain or wiped off on tissue to be trashed.</li>
      <li>UPDATE I have since switched to Geogirl black mascara, which I like a bit better than this tint.  </li>
      <li>just, a good stain to last for a few days...</li>
      <li>It was easy to use and in theory what I wanted, but only came in grey, which is pretty invisible on your lashes for a tint.  </li>
      <li>I use 2-3 coats and it gives my lashes a hint of darker color and a little bit more thickness.  </li>
      <li>Initially, gray didn&#x27;t seem like the right color, even though my hair is now gray, though I color it medium brown.</li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s not black, it doesn&#x27;t show that much, but I&#x27;d prefer it to stay where I put it--</li>
      <li>if someone thinks that it is a little thin on the lashes – it is a tint and not a mascara that often makes lashes look like legs of a fly!).</li>
      <li>I am on my 3rd tube, so it wasn&#x27;t just a &amp;#34;lemon&amp;#34; on the first try.</li>
      <li>(one can do this with mascara, too), and tried the advice to put the container for a short moment into boiling hot water.</li>
      <li>My eyelashes are pretty long, and this tint defines and separates them and adds a decent color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing dramatic, but perfect for everyday makeup, even brighter makeup (</li>
      <li>It goes on thin and takes a while to dry, but looks great for the day.</li>
      <li>Now that they are also greying, I&#x27;ve tried to find mascara and eyebrow products that just tint the hairs a natural looking charcoal like this.</li>
      <li>Soo natural</li>
      <li>Gives a natural looking coat to your lashes.</li>
      <li>It must be the last of the stock, in perhaps the least popular color--just speculating.</li>
      <li>I love how subtle this is.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a natural stain, so it&#x27;s not clumpy or obvious, very natural looking.</li>
      <li>This is helping my lashes, previously damaged by wearing mascara every day, to grow back to their original length.</li>
      <li>But, like most color only mascaras it takes a few minutes to dry and set.</li>
      <li>Regular mascara made my lashes brittle and they frequently broke and fell out.  </li>
      <li>More than half of it is wasted.</li>
      <li>But yes, I continue to put up with the mess to get the color and the price is very reasonable.</li>
      <li>Its thin liquid consistancy makes it easy to color just the lash and brow hairs.</li>
      <li>Gray is hard to find and it seems to be very conditioning and makes a very natural looking brow.</li>

<li> It makes a big mess and gets all over my hands and anything else in its vicinity.</li>
<li> Be careful</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this tint, I am using it very often instead of regular mascara. My eyelashes are pretty long, and this tint defines and separates them and adds a decent color. It&#x27;s nothing dramatic, but perfect for everyday makeup, even brighter makeup (i.e day smoky eyes). I work from home, but I still want to look pretty everyday, so I wear organic/mineral makeup on everyday basis, and this tint is a perfect addition to my routine. I don&#x27;t want to be wearing something that takes my eyelashes out when I wash it off at home. This tint is easily removable (I always use Bioderma micellar water for makeup removal).</li>
    <li> Only mascara I use. Doesn&#x27;t clump or smear.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Just color. Soo natural looking- this IS an eyelash tint and NOT a mascara, which seems to be very hard to find. Worked perfect for a natural look by making my my long blonde lashes visible but not &amp;#34;made up.&amp;#34; No raccoon eyes. Washed off so easily with soap &amp; water with no left over gunk or staining. I would buy again &amp; again :)</li>
    <li> I have searched a long time for a product like this. It gives color without stiffness, fibers, lengtheners, thickeners or glops. I&#x27;ve had silver hair for many years and dark lashes and brows. Now that they are also greying, I&#x27;ve tried to find mascara and eyebrow products that just tint the hairs a natural looking charcoal like this. The soft color is perfect for my pale skin and silver hair. Its thin liquid consistancy makes it easy to color just the lash and brow hairs. I like this geo GIRL product so much that I ordered two more packages immediately.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a natural stain, so it&#x27;s not clumpy or obvious, very natural looking.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed and would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I expected a whole lot more color and definition from this product on my lashes.  Mascara is not optional. I also thought it would be more permanent but it comes right off with makeup wipes.  I can&#x27;t even see it.  It is okay on my brows but I have another product I like better for brows.  It also can be very messy.  It isn&#x27;t thick like mascara so if you tip the bottle it pours out.  Be careful</li>
    <li> I like lash tint better than mascara so I am glad to have found this product on Amazon. It was reasonably priced and arrived very quick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a tint before just mascara. I love how subtle this is. I have white eyelashes, and a fair complexion, so mascara can be a crap shoot on whether it makes me look like a racoon or not. This gives me the hint of color I want without weighing down my lashes, or irritating my eyes. SO happy to have found this product!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I LOVE this product. It works for me, because I&#x27;m in middle age, and all mascaras accentuate my aging features, I think. (For instance, I noticed that my sister, only a year younger than I, looks noticeably younger before applying mascara). About my daughter, she&#x27;s a redhead and all mascaras are too heavy for her fair skin and lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I always like to get this lash tint in brown. Now, you can&#x27;t find it anywhere, Amazon or elsewhere. So we figured out that this product must have been discontinued. Same happened to the similar Neutrogena product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to me that a lot of girls and women would want a lash tint, instead of the always-clumpy-and-often-severe mascaras that are available. Best I can tell, lash TINTs have gone the way of the paleolithic era. It&#x27;s a shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week I did see the KIR lash tint on Amazon in the color gray. It must be the last of the stock, in perhaps the least popular color--just speculating. Initially, gray didn&#x27;t seem like the right color, even though my hair is now gray, though I color it medium brown. I really wanted the brown lash tint. But I ordered the gray, and it works great! I use a brown eye shadow on my lids, and sometimes a light application of brown liner. With all this brown, the gray actually might work better than the brown for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is not interested in trying the gray, however. Gray generally is not a good color for redheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So long KIR lash tint! We will miss you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lash tint for years.  Regular mascara made my lashes brittle and they frequently broke and fell out.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this lash tint, my lashes have been long and healthy.  This product is NOT like mascara.  It&#x27;s thinner and lighter.  It does not yield dramatic results, just definition and separation for a natural, but finished look that wakes up your eyes.  UPDATE I have since switched to Geogirl black mascara, which I like a bit better than this tint.  Since the tint is very thin and wet, I always ended up making a mess with it when applying.  The mascara also gives a natural look but is a little easier to handle.</li>
    <li> This lash tint works ok - very subtle color but at least it is not dried out like the mascara. Would I recommend this product? No, probably not. I think you can do better as far a lash tint is concerned.</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t buy again. truly just a tint. no lengthening. not a traditional mascara</li>
    <li> Just as expected. Gives a natural looking coat to your lashes. Do not buy if you want your lashes to really pop. It does not go on thick.</li>
    <li> First I was sceptical after reading most of the reviews but since this was the only grey tint I gave it a try. At first it seemed to be a little dry and it didn&#x27;t do much. Then I looked in the internet what to do to possibly soften the tint (one can do this with mascara, too), and tried the advice to put the container for a short moment into boiling hot water. Don&#x27;t do this ever – the tint became liquid and squirted out of the container when I pulled the brush out. Disappointed, I put it into my pant pockets and forgot about it. In the evening I found it and gave it another try. GREAT! It was just right and went on easily (if someone thinks that it is a little thin on the lashes – it is a tint and not a mascara that often makes lashes look like legs of a fly!). So all one needs is to give it a little body warmth (ar body-warm water bath for a short time), and it works perfectly!</li>
    <li> satisfactory product that is economical, easy to use, and the right color for me.  i like the product very much</li>
    <li> This product is very thin and squishes out of the container every time I use it. It makes a big mess and gets all over my hands and anything else in its vicinity. I like the color of the product so much and can&#x27;t find the color anywhere else, so that&#x27;s why I keep ordering it. I am on my 3rd tube, so it wasn&#x27;t just a &amp;#34;lemon&amp;#34; on the first try. They all squish out and make a mess. I keep it in the refrigerator and wrapped in a paper towel. It doesn&#x27;t really help the squishiness. I thought it would, but it doesn&#x27;t. But yes, I continue to put up with the mess to get the color and the price is very reasonable. However, I will say that if I ever find gray mascara at Walmart or Target or somewhere comparably priced, I&#x27;ll buy it and abandon the messy product.</li>
    <li> not looking for mascara just, a good stain to last for a few days...my hair is gray &amp; if it had darkened more, it would have been perfect...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years and I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara if you are looking something that is light.  It goes on thin and takes a while to dry, but looks great for the day.</li>
    <li> I like the light, natural, no smudge look BUT and a big BUT. This stuff is so runny that it pukes out of the top and has to be rinsed down the drain or wiped off on tissue to be trashed. More than half of it is wasted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the way it goes on -- it&#x27;s a little thick, and I have to use an eyelash comb after application to separate my lashes BUT I do not get racoon eyes from it, so I&#x27;ll buy it as long as it&#x27;s on the market!</li>
    <li> Soft and defining - not gooey or harsh looking. It will do as a replacement for Neutrogena Lash Tint, which I wore for years until they discontinued it. This mascara is non irritating to my sensitive, contact wearing eyes.</li>
    <li> I was a huge fan of Neutrogena Lash Tint which has been discontinued.  This is the closest substitute  I have found.  I cannot wear most mascara&#x27;s because they flake off almost immediately leaving me with not-so-attractive racoon eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gives my light eyelashes nice color with no added volume or gook.  As it wears off, it merely fades without leaving dark smudges under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for nice, natural color.</li>
    <li> Hands down, my FAVORITE beauty product. This is helping my lashes, previously damaged by wearing mascara every day, to grow back to their original length. I would say that when I wear this, it does NOT look like I&#x27;m wearing mascara, yet it gives me the color and length that an \\&quot;average\\&quot; mascara would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product on a daily basis for 3 months. Now, when I wear mascara at night on the weekends, I keep getting people asking me if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes. This is because my eyelashes have fully recovered from all those years of tugging and ripping lashes out from taking mascara off or from accidentally rubbing my eyes while mascara was on. Not to mention all the nasty chemicals in regular mascara - not a good thing to suffocate your lashes with on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff comes off easily with water - no eye makeup remover required (so no tugging at your lashes, which potentially rips them out). It never gives you raccoon eyes (not even in the pool). Great buildable coverage if you want to reapply throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic ingredients I would feel safe sleeping in, or eating! :) Great consistency. Simply pull through lashes several times with the wand to reduce any watery \\&quot;goo\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gray color is my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the price... who the heck can beat that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only thing in my makeup box that I consider irreplaceable.</li>
    <li> It was easy to use and in theory what I wanted, but only came in grey, which is pretty invisible on your lashes for a tint.  I guess I will look again for black, but as far as I am concerned, grey is a waste of money...</li>
    <li> I use this on my eyebrows . It&#x27;s not too dark but colors just enough and doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;. Can be used on lashes but I found that  it comes off too easily and ends up under my lower lashes. Because it&#x27;s not black, it doesn&#x27;t show that much, but I&#x27;d prefer it to stay where I put it--must be the movement involved with lashes. The brows look just great!!</li>
    <li> this is a repeat buy.  I really like this mascara...well it&#x27;s really just color.  It is good and hardly clumps. But, like most color only mascaras it takes a few minutes to dry and set.</li>
    <li> Not worth the $ works like any</li>
    <li> I specifically bought these for my eye brows.  I have them but they&#x27;re too pale gray and this works great. I thin out the color on the wand on my eyelashes first and then brush my eye brows with it.  Gray is hard to find and it seems to be very conditioning and makes a very natural looking brow.</li>
    <li> Well, actually neutrogena lash tint was the best mascara ever, but since that has been discontinued, this is the closet thing I could find.  I love that it&#x27;s all natural so I feel good about using it on my eyes.  I use 2-3 coats and it gives my lashes a hint of darker color and a little bit more thickness.  I just hate the look of most mascaras -- they just don&#x27;t look natural.  This is such a prettier look IMHO.  Love it!</li>
