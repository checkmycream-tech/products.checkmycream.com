### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It fits my hair perfectly.</li>
      <li>could be perfect, but there is no way to hold It, the holder is sooooo incomfortable.</li>
      <li>Great brush!  </li>
      <li>The tail is awesome for sectioning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great buy - yummy mummy approved.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>The bristles on the brush are great for achieving a smooth result when blow drying my hair.  </li>
      <li>Nice gift for my daughter.</li>
      <li>It is a nice brush well made.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love these brushes- have for years</li>
      <li>Because the nylon bristles are a tad longer than the boar bristles, this brush is best for blowouts and not really well-suited for use all over the head as a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; brush.</li>
      <li>I mostly use the Spornette 2\\&quot; porcupine brush for my blowouts, but this smaller brush is great for putting more curl into the hair around my face.  </li>
      <li>I have bi-racial hair, it&#x27;s curly, fine and has medium thickness, Finding a brush to keep my hair smooth when I straighten it, has been a ongoing battle for 5 years until I found this brush</li>
      <li>I expect that it would be great for ladies with short hair looking for some curl from their blowout, too.  </li>
      <li>Works great on my short hair and bang styling.</li>
      <li>I have a new favorite brush!  </li>
      <li>It hurt and was super cheap.</li>
      <li>I bought it because it&#x27;s supposed to be a great brush for bangs, but I found that my cheaper, bigger round brush works much better.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>This brush really does the trick.</li>
      <li>and it was an &#x27;aha&#x27; moment (thanks Oprah).</li>
      <li>The first time I used this new one---the bristles began coming out.  </li>
      <li>The flecks wiped off easily with a dry cloth.</li>
      <li>Cute little brush, gets the job done.</li>
      <li>Easy to use with dryer in one hand and spornette porcupine brush in the other hand.  </li>
      <li>Love the round brush.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to get a good grip on it especially for someone who has arthritis.</li>
      <li>I would have liked a round brush with a smaller (tighter) circumference.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The boar bristles do shed a bit, but that&#x27;s normal for a natural bristle brush.  </li>
      <li>I threw away the packaging and my old brush.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little scratchier than I imagined, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.  </li>

<li> There&#x27;s some product labeling in black ink on the handle that rubbed off after just a few days, leaving black flecks on my hands.  </li>
<li> I use it was just a little softer.</li>
<li> I had been looking for a round brush that had both boar and nylon bristles.  </li>
<li> My only problem with this brush is the handle, it&#x27;s way too thin!  </li>
<li> I use it to wrap my hair at night and groom my hair during the day, no more puffy hair.</li>
<li> So I am very disappointed!</li>
<li> This brush was terrible!</li>
<li> Really bad!!!</li>

    <li> This brush was terrible! It hurt and was super cheap.</li>
    <li> Works great on my short hair and bang styling. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great brush!  Easy to use with dryer in one hand and spornette porcupine brush in the other hand.  It grabs your hair without pulling, or tangling it.</li>

    <li> Love the round brush.  I use it all the time instead of a curling iron.  Less damaging to the hair.</li>
    <li> Brush arrived and was just what I thought I wanted.  I threw away the packaging and my old brush.  The first time I used this new one---the bristles began coming out.  So I am very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Nice gift for my daughter.</li>
    <li> My travel grooming essential.</li>

    <li> I went for short hair and needed a small round brush. So I did my research. It is a nice brush well made. I use it was just a little softer. It does get the job well done.</li>
    <li> could be perfect, but there is no way to hold It, the holder is sooooo incomfortable. Should be bidder or covered with some plastic</li>
    <li> Really bad!!! Wast of money....</li>
