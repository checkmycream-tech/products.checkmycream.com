      <li>i had seen reviews stating that there is a significant difference in quality between \\&quot;jovan musk by jovan\\&quot; and \\&quot;jovan musk by</li>
      <li>Cologne is obviously a matter of taste but this one is fresh, clean, and attractive.</li>
      <li>what pleasant memories it brings back.....</li>
      <li>coty,\\&quot; the former being superior.</li>
      <li>This is a good basic fragrance for men, and not overpowering like some colognes.</li>

      <li>I was right...</li>
      <li>Fast deliver!</li>
      <li>Thanks again!  </li>
      <li>Ive been using jovan musk for men since middle school and love it...</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re looking for the real thing, this ain&#x27;t it!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>The real thing!</li>
      <li>(ok, I was old fashioned and left it there because it was hot, no pun</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Spray is very convenient and directs cologne to the places you wish to apply it.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my dad because it&#x27;s always been an old favorite, he really enjoys it and not to many places carry the regular colognes anymore, could be a little better packaging when shipped because the bottle was a little beat up.</li>
      <li>honestly thought of this cologne as being old fashioned and only recently started wearing it again.</li>
      <li>A classic scent, but</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I started wearing in this cologne in 1977 in my senior year of high school.</li>
      <li>since I was a teenager I&#x27;ve love Jovan Musk...stopped using it for quite a few years and just started again this year....</li>
      <li>It is a faithful old standard and certainly priced right.</li>
      <li>I test it out and immediately get a cheap fruity flowery smell almost as if it was watered down and very alcoholy.</li>
      <li>Great, the same product i bout from the big stores, only half the price.</li>
      <li>been married to the same girl I started dating in 1977</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve worn several very high end colognes over the years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>it smells like an old ladies</li>
      <li>and it arrived early...</li>
      <li>cheap perfume.i have had disappointments before from other \\&quot;classic\\&quot; colognes,(old spice, canoe, agua lavanda,) mostly because they have hardly any scent, and what there is only lasts a few minutes, but this one i actually had to wash off because i couldn&#x27;t stand it.</li>
      <li>Hubby will only use this and no other.</li>

    <li> Just the best stuff I&#x27;ve found out there. Anyone who gets within two feet always ask &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that you&#x27;re wearing&amp;#34;?</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product, I would recommend to anyone who is a Jovan fan.</li>
    <li> the most fabulous scent for my husband, love it,love it, love it, he has been wearing this for 30 years and everyone stops him and tells him how good he smells</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Love item.  Recommend to others..</li>
    <li> 30-40 years and still my favorite</li>
    <li> just wish it would stay longer, the ladies love it !!!!</li>
    <li> Great thanks.  Just as I expected - but I had to travel half way around the world to restock - all the way from NZ !</li>
    <li> The aroma don&#x27;t still long</li>
    <li> I started wearing in this cologne in 1977 in my senior year of high school. Please do not exit this based on my age. The human olfactory system has been stable for thousands of years and I&#x27;ve worn several very high end colognes over the years.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly thought of this cologne as being old fashioned and only recently started wearing it again. I&#x27;ve had several comments in the past 2 months asking me what I&#x27;m wearing buy both women and guys asking for advice.&lt;br /&gt;I give this, one of very my very few reviews, to guys who are dating as money very well spent.&lt;br /&gt;I been married to the same girl I started dating in 1977 and she still comments on my sweater that I left at her house after a date (ok, I was old fashioned and left it there because it was hot, no pun intended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne works!</li>
    <li> Product I have been using for a long time. Just what I was looking for and&lt;br /&gt;in a good timeframe and good price.</li>
    <li> The real thing! Hubby will only use this and no other. Got a super deal and will try this again when he runs out!</li>
    <li> i had seen reviews stating that there is a significant difference in quality between \\&quot;jovan musk by jovan\\&quot; and \\&quot;jovan musk by coty,\\&quot; the former being superior. i purchased this one, based on the description. when it arrived i was disappointed  to find that it was labeled as the one from coty. i haven&#x27;t yet smelled the jovan one but it has to be better than this. it smells like an old ladies cheap perfume.i have had disappointments before from other \\&quot;classic\\&quot; colognes,(old spice, canoe, agua lavanda,) mostly because they have hardly any scent, and what there is only lasts a few minutes, but this one i actually had to wash off because i couldn&#x27;t stand it. i guess they just don&#x27;t make&#x27;em like they used to. if you&#x27;re looking for the real thing, this ain&#x27;t it!</li>
    <li> Great, the same product i bout from the big stores, only half the price.</li>
    <li> I like this cologne, it smells very good</li>
    <li> A little weak on the staying power front.  A classic scent, but maybe the cheapy versions are not what they used to be.  Spray on fairly heavy to impress your wife on the car ride to the party, otherwise no one there will know you&#x27;re wearing much anyway.  OKAY rated just because the scent is so classic.</li>
    <li> Perfect as a gift.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Ive been using jovan musk for men since middle school and love it...nothing compares. I usually go to the store or shop to buy but I was on Amazon and thought this might be more covenant. I purchased two 3fl oz sprays from monagifts and once I opened the packaging which was nice and it arrived early... I test it out and immediately get a cheap fruity flowery smell almost as if it was watered down and very alcoholy. I thought it was just me but compared it to the one from the store that was running low and asked my sister... I was right...its not jovan musk or at least only jovan musk which is what I wanted and paid for. Buyer beware..dont purchase from monagifts..someone is tampering with them. Very dissapointed in the waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> great and price was good</li>
    <li> Cologne is obviously a matter of taste but this one is fresh, clean, and attractive. It is a faithful old standard and certainly priced right. Spray is very convenient and directs cologne to the places you wish to apply it. Highly recommended.</li>

    <li> I love this stuff, and this was the best price to be found anywhere, less than half of the store price. EXCELLENT VALUE!</li>
    <li> MY HUSBANDS FAVORITE.  HE ALWAYS SPLASHES ALL OVER.</li>
    <li> What can I say....since I was a teenager I&#x27;ve love Jovan Musk...stopped using it for quite a few years and just started again this year....what pleasant memories it brings back.....love this stuff....to me it smells just like the original....</li>
    <li> This is a good basic fragrance for men, and not overpowering like some colognes. I would definitely recommend it .</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this musk I keep it in my house for all my men friends to use it it was delivered promptly it was wrapped meticulously very happy</li>
    <li> Too long on shelf, fragrant weak</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, and I think 10 times better than that super pricey colones that don&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff lasts all day!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good on my husband.  He has been wearing it since he was 13 and it&#x27;s his identity.  We never forget to get it for him for Christmas.</li>
    <li> The last time I purchased this cologne was about 20 years ago.  It does not last. After 20 minutes the aroma is gone. Too bad.</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite!  Glad that I could find it.  Such an affordable price too!  Thanks again!  Fast deliver!</li>
    <li> I have always liked Jovan Musk Cologne but could not find it in the department stores any more.&lt;br /&gt;Good smelling product!!</li>
