      <li>but the product works great</li>
      <li>Great job!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Worked great for homemade shave cream.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product for the price though.</li>
      <li>this is good stuff works great</li>
      <li>This shea butter didn&#x27;t disappoint at a good price.</li>
      <li>It was good over all.</li>
      <li>Feels really good on my skin</li>
      <li>Product is organic and akine to the butters I buy from my beloved street vendors.</li>
      <li>love Amazon&#x27;s great service</li>
      <li>Satisfied!</li>
      <li>Love this shea butter!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>I still tried to use it and although it felt great on my skin I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable leathering a product on my skin with that smell</li>
      <li>the smell is kind of strong but not overpowering</li>
      <li>some days I&#x27;ll update my review again to say more about quality of this Shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;After all, I like it.</li>
      <li>Well, I just received this butter and am wondering whether it&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;Ghana scam&amp;#34; thing in which they&#x27;re famous</li>
      <li>I love Shea butter</li>
      <li>This works magic on it.</li>
      <li>I use this for homeade deodorant and I love this product</li>
      <li>It came in a nice container, all clean...</li>
      <li>BUT the texture is pretty good and works well.</li>
      <li>I originally gave it 3 stars due to the organic issue but because customer service was so excellent</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m moving on to Cocoa Butter now, and while I can&#x27;t vouch for the healing qualities, smelling like chocolate is already a huge improvement.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s important that the smell is not bothering me.</li>
      <li>He said if I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using it that he would give me a refund.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s because the butter is organic and unrefined.</li>
      <li>I use it for everything; moisturizer, lotion, put it on dry patches - just an all over great thing for skin.</li>
      <li>When you are making cosmetics, it&#x27;s very important to know how much you are using.</li>
      <li>I may not order again due to buying most of the time from my beloved street vendors but I will recommend this seller to others.</li>
      <li>and they were quick in sending a replacement.</li>
      <li>Looking forward to making my own whipped Shea with essential oils.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy, not gritty and it smells nice.</li>
      <li>The yellow kind has a sweeter smell.</li>
      <li>oil does not smell fresh.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the Shea butter, however, I didn&#x27;t get my free can with my last purchase.</li>
      <li>I really like it!  </li>
      <li>This is my first Shea butter, and for now I rate with four stars.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
      <li>and it still smells funny</li>
      <li>Once I get the essential oil in it, I will be able to get it closer to my face.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>And it didn&#x27;t have a funny smell or anything</li>
      <li>and I should have put more essential oils to cover the smell.</li>
      <li>The seller was VERY helpful and responded right away.</li>
      <li>I will still use the product because it&#x27;s amazing none the less</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
      <li>The texture is ok, but the smell is somehow bitter.</li>
      <li>very nutty.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I needed to make all natural lip balm and lotions.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended product for cosmetic products.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;100% natural&amp;#34; does not mean organic.</li>
      <li>I live in the desert</li>
      <li>Hopefully, I will have more luck with the other brand (Village Shea Butter) that I just purchased because I can&#x27;t find the african one I used to buy anymore.</li>
      <li>My cat who normally is into all kinds of natural oils smelled, shivered and walked away ...&lt;</li>
      <li>I returned the first one and received second one</li>
      <li>I use this straight as a facial and body moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also extremely sensitive to chemicals and this doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s also some darker areas in the butter, but I don&#x27;t know if all this is just natural.</li>
      <li>and overnight they were super soft and lasted for a few days.  </li>
      <li>the scent is really not overpowering at all,  I very easily warm it up on my hands with a bit of raw coconut oil and massage it on my face every night before going to sleep!  </li>
      <li>awesome quality, it smells very earthy/woody, but not on a nasty way!  </li>
      <li>It worked pretty well healing a sunburn I got but other than that</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that the texture is super hard.</li>

<li> I have a long time.</li>
<li> When I usually buy a tub it last such a long time even with daily use.</li>
<li> , it was a little disappointing in the moisture department and smells kind of musky</li>
<li> so my skin gets very dry.</li>
<li> but the product is not what I expected.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s possible given that the butter is practically solid and would require heat and friction to melt down.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that the description of this shea butter on Amazon says that it&#x27;s organic and unrefined but it doesn&#x27;t say organic or unrefined anywhere on the container.</li>
<li> I was excited about this product, and hoped to use it in makeup, but the smell was so bad</li>
<li> The Shea butter smells rlly gassy and even has a slight petroleum scent.</li>
<li> This one, I made 6 little jars of body butter</li>
<li> but it was a little hard to break up,  </li>
<li> Not sure if its me</li>
<li> I could not tell if it worked because I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
<li> not only this product non-organic (chemicals in fats and oils are triple dangerous, everybody knows that by now!)</li>
<li> very thick texture.</li>
<li> The butter itself is very thick</li>
<li> so I&#x27;ve had a lot of products lotions and creams irritating my skin.</li>
<li> I tried this today on this horrible rash I&#x27;ve had under my arm, and I can already feel it working.</li>
<li> (my mom told me not to use it around her because she hated the smell!).</li>

    <li> This is exactly what I needed to make all natural lip balm and lotions.  It&#x27;s a terrific moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This is my first Shea butter, and for now I rate with four stars.&lt;br /&gt;After some days I&#x27;ll update my review again to say more about quality of this Shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;After all, I like it. Thank you</li>
    <li> I was excited about this product, and hoped to use it in makeup, but the smell was so bad, I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be able to use it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a moisturizer and to treat scars and stretch marks. It worked pretty well healing a sunburn I got but other than that, it was a little disappointing in the moisture department and smells kind of musky (my mom told me not to use it around her because she hated the smell!). I&#x27;m moving on to Cocoa Butter now, and while I can&#x27;t vouch for the healing qualities, smelling like chocolate is already a huge improvement.</li>
    <li> Love this shea butter! I use it for everything; moisturizer, lotion, put it on dry patches - just an all over great thing for skin. And it didn&#x27;t have a funny smell or anything -thought I saw people complaining about that.</li>
    <li> awesome quality, it smells very earthy/woody, but not on a nasty way!  I really like it!  the scent is really not overpowering at all,  I very easily warm it up on my hands with a bit of raw coconut oil and massage it on my face every night before going to sleep!  oh my gosh my skin looks SO amazing in the morning!!!</li>
    <li> The Shea butter itself is great! It&#x27;s creamy, not gritty and it smells nice. My only complaint is that the description of this shea butter on Amazon says that it&#x27;s organic and unrefined but it doesn&#x27;t say organic or unrefined anywhere on the container. It says &amp;#34;100 percent natural&amp;#34; but It doesn&#x27;t say that its organic. &amp;#34;100% natural&amp;#34; does not mean organic. It&#x27;s a great product for the price though. Update: I contacted the seller about the Shea butter being truly organic and he said they are working on getting paperwork from Ghana to say it is organic. I don&#x27;t think the item description should say organic if it isn&#x27;t (or if they can&#x27;t verify it is). The seller was VERY helpful and responded right away. He said if I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using it that he would give me a refund. I originally gave it 3 stars due to the organic issue but because customer service was so excellent I changed it to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> this is good stuff works great</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Shipping was on time.. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that the texture is super hard. To soften it, I&#x27;m going to heat it up a bit and whip it so I can use it for my hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Product is organic and akine to the butters I buy from my beloved street vendors. Same consistency and has a creamy whipped feeling.  I may not order again due to buying most of the time from my beloved street vendors but I will recommend this seller to others. Highly recommended product for cosmetic products. I use my shea butter for DIY hair and body butters.</li>
    <li> Not sure if its me but it was a little hard to break up,  It was good over all.</li>
    <li> I tried this today on this horrible rash I&#x27;ve had under my arm, and I can already feel it working. I can strech without feeling like my skin is tearing. Great job!&lt;br /&gt;I RECIEVED A DISCOUNT FOR THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR A REVIEW</li>
    <li> I enjoy the Shea butter, however, I didn&#x27;t get my free can with my last purchase. I purchased 2 jars of Shea butter and was expecting 2 cans😥</li>
    <li> Looks and smells great! Definitely will buy again!</li>
    <li> Worked great for homemade shave cream. It came in a plastic tub double bagged. I would order from them again.</li>
    <li> The discription says the product does not spoil but the smell is rancid I still tried to use it and although it felt great on my skin I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable leathering a product on my skin with that smell I returned the first one and received second one and it still smells funny but I can stand this one  I gave it 4 stars because of the smell but the product works great I put it on my feet and overnight they were super soft and lasted for a few days.  love Amazon&#x27;s great service and they were quick in sending a replacement.</li>
    <li> I do not like the smell. very nutty. but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s because the butter is organic and unrefined. I could not tell if it worked because I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell. if it&#x27;s organic you&#x27;re looking for this is it. very thick texture.</li>
    <li> This is very good...the smell is kind of strong but not overpowering and it dissipates. I will be combining it with an essential oil once I read up on how to do that. The butter itself is very thick but if you rub it in your hands, it softens enough to use it. It does what is promised: softens your skin. Once I get the essential oil in it, I will be able to get it closer to my face.</li>
    <li> Love this! Feels really good on my skin</li>
    <li> I use this straight as a facial and body moisturizer. I live in the desert so my skin gets very dry. I&#x27;m also extremely sensitive to chemicals and this doesn&#x27;t make me break out. This works magic on it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is an &amp;#34;unrefined&amp;#34; product. I bought shea butter before on Amazon and it was yellow; this one is beige. The yellow kind has a sweeter smell. The texture is ok, but the smell is somehow bitter. I make whipped body butter with shea butter and it&#x27;s important that the smell is not bothering me. This one, I made 6 little jars of body butter and I should have put more essential oils to cover the smell. Maybe it is just mine that is like that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It came in a nice container, all clean...but the product is not what I expected. Also, they forgot to write &amp;#34;8 oz&amp;#34; on the label. When you are making cosmetics, it&#x27;s very important to know how much you are using. I had to wash my hands, and check it out on Amazon website. I won&#x27;t buy or use this brand again. Hopefully, I will have more luck with the other brand (Village Shea Butter) that I just purchased because I can&#x27;t find the african one I used to buy anymore.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting. Looking forward to making my own whipped Shea with essential oils. Satisfied!</li>
    <li> The consistency is perfect. I mix it with oils to make a whipped butter for my hair &amp; skin. I definitely prefer the ivory to the gold now.</li>
    <li> Unrefined shea butter is all I use. It does wonders for my skin. This shea butter didn&#x27;t disappoint at a good price.</li>
    <li> I use this for homeade deodorant and I love this product</li>
    <li> I love Shea butter I have a long time. When I usually buy a tub it last such a long time even with daily use. I have super sensitive skin so I&#x27;ve had a lot of products lotions and creams irritating my skin. I&#x27;ve found this does not. No problems with shipping except that it seems as though it has spilled out which I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s possible given that the butter is practically solid and would require heat and friction to melt down. I will still use the product because it&#x27;s amazing none the less</li>
    <li> Well, I just received this butter and am wondering whether it&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;Ghana scam&amp;#34; thing in which they&#x27;re famous worldwide.&lt;br /&gt;First of, not only this product non-organic (chemicals in fats and oils are triple dangerous, everybody knows that by now!) but no even mention of all those goodie-goodie things they put online on this actual package (which even, for some reason, arrived soiled on the outside with something totally unrelated to the product color or consistency).&lt;br /&gt; My cat who normally is into all kinds of natural oils smelled, shivered and walked away ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil does not smell fresh.</li>
    <li> I rlly don&#x27;t know. The Shea butter smells rlly gassy and even has a slight petroleum scent. There&#x27;s also some darker areas in the butter, but I don&#x27;t know if all this is just natural. The label doesn&#x27;t say anything about it being organic which is suspicious. BUT the texture is pretty good and works well.</li>
