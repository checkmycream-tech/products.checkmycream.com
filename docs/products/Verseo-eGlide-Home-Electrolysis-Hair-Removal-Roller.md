### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am extremely happy with the results!  </li>
      <li>It also seems to go through a lot of batteries, so best to have a supply of AAAs at hand.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy with its construction.  </li>
      <li>I think they&#x27;ve got a GREAT idea with roller electrolysis</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s just great</li>
      <li>This roller seemed like a great solution.  </li>
      <li>You have to use it more than once, but it does work!!  </li>
      <li>I know having hair on your face is terrible,I sympathize with all who suffer from it,but Use  at your own RISK!</li>
      <li>and I have already seen remarkable results.  </li>
      <li>I have to kids and just don&#x27;t have that kind of time!  </li>
      <li>I also trusted that it would be a good quality product because I have purchased items from Hammacher before.  </li>
      <li>It is a good bang for the buck.  </li>
      <li>I thought this might be a good alternative</li>
      <li>And She Said She Loved It, Works Where It Is Needed</li>
      <li>&quot; I honestly can&#x27;t say if I&#x27;ve had a reduction of hair growth or not.  </li>
      <li>I use my own Tweezerman.</li>
      <li>I had a number of reader questions on it and some reports of people who liked the product and some reports of people who did not care for it or who did not see results.</li>
      <li>Yes I know it should take more than 3 months to achieve good results but after 3months and nothing at all</li>
      <li>but once I saw your reviews it made my decision not to buy the item so very easy.</li>
      <li>I bought this product a couple of months ago and honestly have noticed a difference--the hair is becoming lighter and I am noticing some hair is already ceased growth.  </li>
      <li>And Very light</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m more upset about the fact</li>
      <li>I am glad I bought this</li>
      <li>It is a lovely idea.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I could have found the battery at a better price.</li>
      <li>It takes many weeks in order to remove the hair.</li>
      <li>At that time, I did have what I would say is around maybe 70% or more hair removal.</li>
      <li>The hair is mostly gone, not 100%</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I think I can safely say this will not work me.</li>
      <li>I wonder if it takes more time, or are you supposed to feel or notice hair loss immediately?  </li>
      <li>I guess the best description I can give this product is all Hype and NO Action.</li>
      <li>Verseo (on their website) states &#x27;100% satisfaction guaranteed no hassle returns and easy exchanges&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I had no pain or problems with it and it is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Thank you for helping me make a decision so easily.</li>
      <li>(and I&#x27;m sure there will be many better followers to come), is probably going to make professional electrlysis obsolete, but it&#x27;s going to TAKE SOME TIME!</li>
      <li>It is also cheaply constructed and will not run on rechargeable batteries.</li>
      <li>Everything VERSEO makes is a cheap knock off.</li>
      <li>It is made of all cheap plastic.  </li>
      <li>The item is cheap and does NOT work.  </li>
      <li>I tried precisely as the instructions indicated, on the armpits and legs...</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t just whisk it across your face like a quick shave, and expect to be smooth and free for a lifetime.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I originally bought an eGlide after doing a report on it on my website, Beauty and Fashion Tech.</li>
      <li>]\\&quot; which links to the original report with a number of reader comments.</li>
      <li>Keeping the tweezer clean while tweezing helps too.  </li>
      <li>I have a drawer full of gadgets and waxes.  </li>
      <li>The good news is on my last week of use</li>
      <li>The product itself is not made from high quality materials, but it is much more affordable than the laser options.  </li>
      <li>I can only say that she is very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>better followers to come), is probably going to make professional electrlysis obsolete, but it&#x27;s going to TAKE SOME TIME!</li>
      <li>My only worry about legs is that it will take quite some time, but it sure is cheaper than a laser!</li>
      <li>This product should come with a warning, maybe (like NONO, another product I tried) it works temporarily on smooth fine hair,or young hair.</li>
      <li>Do NOT waste your money!!!!!</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s great is that, unlike laser which is expensive but better for large areas, you don&#x27;t have to wait more than 2-3 days to use it again</li>
      <li>Should I be using it before the hair grows back for it to be effective?</li>
      <li>i this their previous item (the same brand but with patches) is better than this one, but this is good</li>
      <li>First of all I&#x27;d like to say that I also made a review on Verseo.com website and they removed it because I gave them 2 stars, so now I&#x27;m giving them 1.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted this product to work, but it ended up burning my thumbs!  </li>
      <li>I have tried more than one following instructions and it is not what they advertise it to</li>
      <li>I used this item consistently for 4 months and received no results.  </li>
      <li>As a transwoman, I have paid a fortune to get rid of most of my facial hair, but I have so much hair elsewhere</li>
      <li>It took about 14 weeks of regular use to really see  results, and I saw the most results after 5-6 months or so, when I also quit using it.</li>
      <li>After careful review, laser removal is only FDA approved for hair reduction, not hair removal and works best on dark hair and light skin (like mine).  </li>
      <li>What this product does not tell you up front is you have to tweeze every single hair after every use, and the very nature of tweezing your hair that many times in a row will make your hair thinner because hair grows in stages.  </li>
      <li>and i can&#x27;t wait until higher quality devices begin to show up to replace the &#x27;three&#x27; rating that i had to give to this particular product.</li>
      <li>and i can&#x27;t wait until higher quality devices begin to show up to replace the &#x27;three&#x27; rating that i had to give to this particular</li>
      <li>but this is too much.  </li>
      <li>After reading so much about this eGlide I was sold that it was just what I needed.</li>
      <li>I bought it for my daughter and it did absolutely nothing at all.</li>
      <li>I boght it in amazon uk and I&#x60;m really dissapointed.</li>
      <li>This product does not even come with warnings, as a matter of fact, the ads are very self assured.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend getting the product if you would like your hair to be removed fast on your legs, underarms, and feet.</li>
      <li>would have really gone 3 1/2 since, although I had some results with it</li>
      <li>Just like Wisconsin Lady, I really, really wanted this thing to work.</li>
      <li>It is very time consuming.  </li>
      <li>However, when I use this unit, all the lights do what they say in the guide, but I feel absolutely NOTHING when I use the roller.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times, and it really seems to work.  </li>
      <li>The US government is VERY strict on products claiming &#x27;permanent hair removal&#x27;.</li>
      <li>so I cannot write much on it</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like to use it more, but i pretty much need to shave daily for my job, and don&#x27;t get the opportunity to get enough growth so that i can tweeze the hair afterwords.</li>
      <li>Although that probably just tells you how simple and non extensive this thing is and it probably takes alot more than this to permanently remove hair.</li>
      <li>however I dont think this flimsy little thing is powerful enough to do much at all for most people.</li>
      <li>far overrated!!</li>
      <li>If you seriously want at home permanent hair loss I would (and am) look into a more powerful device.</li>
      <li>You also need to make sure you use the machine a few times a week.  </li>
      <li>I previously did laser hair removal on my legs, which is my preference for that and what I would still recommend there since the eGlide really is better suited for small areas and for me the laser worked much better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too small a unit for a large area, thought that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s intended for, but it&#x27;s perfect for an area like upper lip, chin (not eyebrows) and other smaller zones.  </li>
      <li>I read other reviews that said it was cheaply made which I disagree with.  </li>
      <li>so you never have to live with &#x27;sprouts&#x27; that may get noticed.  </li>
      <li>Diligently worked that patch for 2-3 months, whenever there was new hair growth (since you&#x27;re supposed to tweeze all the hair after treatment).</li>
      <li>I do find the unit challenging in that maintaining exactly the right amount of contact is difficult.  </li>
      <li>And if you buy from their site they tell you that your card didn&#x27;t go through when it clearly did!</li>
      <li>When I received the item and used it the first time I realized that it did not even work properly.  </li>
      <li>My first day of use: using it on my left underarm to see if there is a difference after several uses, no visible hair reduction after first use.  </li>
      <li>I also found that if I roll a section and then roll another section giving the first a chance to do its thing and then went back and did the tweezing, it was easier to remove the hairs.  </li>
      <li>To some extent it is too new for me to completely make up my mind on that too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that the green contact light doesn&#x27;t always switch on, even when I&#x27;ve put it new batteries.  </li>
      <li>I have gone to a professional electrologist and I understand that electrology works but is not a fast process or a quick fix.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, this thing is cheaply made, and sometimes my &#x27;contact&#x27; light doesn&#x27;t come on, but it still appears to be doing the job.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is a good bang for the buck.  I don&#x27;t think I could have found the battery at a better price.</li>
    <li> This product did not wok for me.  I had to return this item.  Not for people with carpal tunnel syndrome</li>
    <li> I think this will meet up to its promises over time.  I&#x27;ve noticed that the green contact light doesn&#x27;t always switch on, even when I&#x27;ve put it new batteries.  It also seems to go through a lot of batteries, so best to have a supply of AAAs at hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a couple of months ago and honestly have noticed a difference--the hair is becoming lighter and I am noticing some hair is already ceased growth.  I am glad I bought this and it didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> DO NOT but this item.  It is horrible.  The item is cheap and does NOT work.  I used this item consistently for 4 months and received no results.  I can&#x27;t believe how silly I must have looked sitting in front of the TV rolling this piece of garbage up and down my body.  Do NOT waste your money!!!!!</li>
    <li> Everything VERSEO makes is a cheap knock off. And unfortunately, their prices so not reflect their cheap quality. Do not waste your hard earned money on this.</li>
    <li> i this their previous item (the same brand but with patches) is better than this one, but this is good</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews prior to buying this product.  I also trusted that it would be a good quality product because I have purchased items from Hammacher before.  Unfortunately, this product is cheaply built and fell apart after one use.  It is made of all cheap plastic.  I did used it once and it didn&#x27;t actually work like it was supposed to.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product as they described and have not seen any improvement.  I was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s slow; takes a long time to get rid of hair - but it works.  It&#x27;s too small a unit for a large area, thought that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s intended for, but it&#x27;s perfect for an area like upper lip, chin (not eyebrows) and other smaller zones.  What&#x27;s great is that, unlike laser which is expensive but better for large areas, you don&#x27;t have to wait more than 2-3 days to use it again so you never have to live with &#x27;sprouts&#x27; that may get noticed.  I do find the unit challenging in that maintaining exactly the right amount of contact is difficult.  But I broke my unit and am about to order another so maybe it was the one I had.</li>
    <li> does not perform as advertised</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003ZT67I2 e GLIDE Roller Electroysis System]]&lt;br /&gt;I do not think this product should be sold. After using for  3 months, I thought my hair was lessening, then eruptions (like pimples, that hurt) began to appear on my face. It was hair that had grown under the skin,some even sideways! I had to go to a&lt;br /&gt;doctor. This product should come with a warning, maybe (like NONO, another product I tried) it works temporarily on smooth fine hair,or young hair.Temporarily!!&lt;br /&gt;But on stubborn,corse hair it causes terrible problems. I am an educated woman, and follow instructions carefully.I have paid for expensive laser removal,and never had a problem, it&#x27;s just so expensive, and most of my hair is light to gray which does not work with laser.&lt;br /&gt; This product does not even come with warnings, as a matter of fact, the ads are very self assured. I do not think it should be sold, I would never let my daughter use it, no young person should. I have scars. I have written to Amazon, and the State Attorney General&#x27;s office of Consumer Affairs in N.Y... I never write these reviews, but I am hoping to save another the horrible experience I had.I know having hair on your face is terrible,I sympathize with all who suffer from it,but Use  at your own RISK!</li>
    <li> Thank you for helping me make a decision so easily. I had all but bought the eglider but once I saw your reviews it made my decision not to buy the item so very easy.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive any pain from this product but it also says it will take 90 days to work because hair follicles grow in stages so in 90 days I will create an update</li>
    <li> My first day of use: using it on my left underarm to see if there is a difference after several uses, no visible hair reduction after first use.  I have followed the instructions and expected the hair to fall out - this is not the case, afterwards you are to use the included tweezers to remove the hair.  I do not understand other reviewers who claim this product works on day 1 as a result.  The product itself is not made from high quality materials, but it is much more affordable than the laser options.  After careful review, laser removal is only FDA approved for hair reduction, not hair removal and works best on dark hair and light skin (like mine).  I opted for this because it was cheaper and its method is FDA approved for hair removal per Wikipedia.  So far, I am not impressed.  I plan to update this as things progress.</li>
    <li> I have used my roller a few times and I&#x27;m happy with its construction.  I read other reviews that said it was cheaply made which I disagree with.  I think it seems well made.  My only concern is that I cannot tell if it&#x27;s working.  I understand patience and I have no problem with that, but I feel nothing during treatment, and there has been no hairs coming out in the aftermath of treatment.  I wonder if it takes more time, or are you supposed to feel or notice hair loss immediately?  I will update.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really rate the e Glide yet, as hair removal takes a LONG time to achieve. However, when I use this unit, all the lights do what they say in the guide, but I feel absolutely NOTHING when I use the roller.  Thought I should at least feel a little tingle, or hear a buzz or SOMETHING. So, I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s working properly and I cannot find a FAQ area, other reviews, etc. to know if this is the way it&#x27;s supposed to operate or not.</li>
    <li> You have to use it more than once, but it does work!!  I am extremely happy with the results!  No more razor burn and no more in-grown hairs!</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work, but it ended up burning my thumbs!  I have gone to a professional electrologist and I understand that electrology works but is not a fast process or a quick fix.  I wanted to take care of a few stray hairs and do my legs myself.  All of my observations were made on the body setting, not on the lower powered face setting.     I followed the directions to the letter.  There is no tingling at the point of treatment if you use the conducting gel.  The challenge I found is that I was getting painful burns on my thumbs.  It took me awhile to figure out what was going on...but here goes.      Electricity runs in a circuit, \\&quot;circle.\\&quot;  The way electrology zaps hairs is by entering your body, moving through the hair folicles, through the skin and back into the E-glide through the hand.  At the point of re-entery, my thumbs, there were nasty holes being burned into my flesh as I used the device. Why always my thumbs and not my fingers?  Electricity takes the shortest path and my thumb is shorter than any of my fingers.  I kept changing hands and hand positions and where ever and how ever I held it I kept getting burned.  The rub is that you must complete the circuit with your body or electrology won&#x27;t work, so wearing a glove or a non-conductor would be a waste of time.  I ended up returning the product.  It is a lovely idea.  I hope they get this glitch fixed.</li>
    <li> Just like Wisconsin Lady, I really, really wanted this thing to work. As a transwoman, I have paid a fortune to get rid of most of my facial hair, but I have so much hair elsewhere that I want to be rid of!  This roller seemed like a great solution.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times, and it really seems to work.  However!!!  Again, just like Wisconsin Lady, this thing gives me painful burns.  In my case it is in my finger, not my thumb, but the pain is impossible to ignore no matter where it is.  I still have a pinpoint scar on my finger from the burns.  I am no wimp when it comes to pain - I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of hours with professional electrologists - but this is too much.  Unless I can figure out a way around this, I too will return my roller.</li>
    <li> i hate this! this product does NOT work! ive used in for months and hv not seen any results at all. how do i return it?!</li>
    <li> I got my roller a few months ago and it has worked on peach fuzz on my face. The hair is mostly gone, not 100% but maybe like 80%. I want to try it on my legs next. I had no pain or problems with it and it is easy to use. My only worry about legs is that it will take quite some time, but it sure is cheaper than a laser!</li>
    <li> I used this device as instructed for six months with absolutely no results. I was using the facial setting to no avail. It is also cheaply constructed and will not run on rechargeable batteries. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I originally bought an eGlide after doing a report on it on my website, Beauty and Fashion Tech. I had a number of reader questions on it and some reports of people who liked the product and some reports of people who did not care for it or who did not see results. So, I figured I would give it a try on some facial hair. It took about 14 weeks of regular use to really see  results, and I saw the most results after 5-6 months or so, when I also quit using it. At that time, I did have what I would say is around maybe 70% or more hair removal. Not too bad. But the product is not the easiest to use, takes time and consistency, and the directions say to pluck the hair after use, which makes it hard for use on large areas. One of my readers reported injury from what I suspect was a defective eglide (I think that person also posted a review here-the person with burnt thumbs). I haven&#x27;t had problems such as that or problems with the device falling apart the way I have read a few others did, but it isn&#x27;t the sturdiest looking thing either, which at $80-90 I really didn&#x27;t expect. I previously did laser hair removal on my legs, which is my preference for that and what I would still recommend there since the eGlide really is better suited for small areas and for me the laser worked much better. But for those who can&#x27;t use a laser, or who want to remove facial hair, where a laser should not be used, it is an affordable enough option that it might be worth a try. I am seeing reports of it working for perhaps half the people who use it. There definitely are people who do not get results with it. To some extent it is too new for me to completely make up my mind on that too. It is also hard to say if people who don&#x27;t see results used it long enough or consistently enough. Here is my review of it on my site: \\&quot;[...]\\&quot; which links to the original report with a number of reader comments. I gave this 4 stars because I did generally like the product, but if they allowed half stars here, I likely would have really gone 3 1/2 since, although I had some results with it, it isn&#x27;t the easiest item to use.likely would have really gone 3 1/2 since, although I had some results with it, it isn&#x27;t the easiest item to use.</li>
    <li> First of all I&#x27;d like to say that I also made a review on Verseo.com website and they removed it because I gave them 2 stars, so now I&#x27;m giving them 1.  The machine is low quality plastic.  I had to return the machine once because the hinge came off the roller part and it was also stinging my fingers which can be a little painful.  During the return they had lost my order and almost refused to send me another after about 2-3 months, with proof that I had sent it back.  I just so happened to find my package number laying around.  People rave about this product after just a few days which makes no sense.  People are like \\&quot;OMG I used it once and there&#x27;s no hair anymore!\\&quot;  Um first of all duh!!!  You pulled them out with tweezers.  They will not come back over night.  It takes weeks for your hair cycle to go back to those hairs you just pulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the results that I have seen is not worth the product.  If you are going to buy it anyway, you need to buy an extra bottle of the gel.  You also need to make sure you use the machine a few times a week.  It does still sting your fingers, unless both my machines just happen to do that.  If you feel a sting happening, quickly switch hands because it does get worse!  After over a year of use I&#x27;m still seeing about 85-90% of the hair.  Small little patches here and there.  I am not happy with this product and would never tell someone to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, It has been about 2 months since I posted the other two paragraphs.  I used it for well over a year and gave up a few weeks ago.  It&#x27;s useless, time consuming and would now give it 0 stars if possible.  Save your money, I wish I did.</li>
    <li> I have to give it 2 stars because it did seem to work for me but it is entirely too time consuming!  I have to kids and just don&#x27;t have that kind of time!  I did see results, but not enough to keep up eith it.  My mom however has all the time to do this and faithfully did it every day for a month and didn&#x27;t see any results...not sure why!?  I think you have a 50/50 and need ALOT of time!</li>
    <li> I would not bother wasting your time with this item.  I have returned it.  There is nothing about it that made me feel like it was legit and would actually give any results.  When I received the item and used it the first time I realized that it did not even work properly.  I only gave it one star because I had to.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for the last month as outlined in the instructions but have yet to see any appreciable difference in the hair growth, both in thickness and frequency. I said I&#x27;d use it for 6 weeks and if no real difference was detected, I&#x27;d contact you and the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I am  very disappointed after several uses did not see any results. I would not recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> I tried precisely as the instructions indicated, on the armpits and legs... tried this for months... completely worthless, do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> not as advertised does not work as advertised.does not remove hair as advertised,shipping was fast .i was very very disappointed</li>
    <li> These devices do not work.  In fact, they are on the verge of medical quackery.  I should have known.....  Go for an IPL flash unit instead.</li>
    <li> It is a waste of my money. Tried it for 3 months.Not effective at all.&lt;br /&gt;It is a non-rechargeable device.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item over a year ago. Decided to try it on a specific area (face). Diligently worked that patch for 2-3 months, whenever there was new hair growth (since you&#x27;re supposed to tweeze all the hair after treatment). Then I lost motivation and stopped.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until later in the year during normal grooming that I noticed that I was getting maybe 1 hair a month in that area. I worked it again and after about a month, no more hair growth in that area at all.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a long, long time, but keep at it. I think it&#x27;s just great I never have to worry about having that embarrassing facial hair again!</li>
    <li> I sent this item back. I was very disappointed because I could never get it to work even though I followed the trouble shooting suggestions exactly. Not worth the time to order because it will go back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this regularly but it is now 4 months and I only see some slight permanent hair removal.  far overrated!!</li>
    <li> The batteries were dead and the product kept shutting off.  I returned the product.</li>
    <li> It does absolutly NOTHING. A waste of my money. I boght it in amazon uk and I&#x60;m really dissapointed. When I use it I don&#x60;t feel it and I&#x60;ve lost no hair. I&#x27;ll stick to laser.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO GO THROUGH.  I PREFER THE BELLABE.</li>
    <li> Actually it doesn&#x27;t remove the hair .  I have tried more than one following instructions and it is not what they advertise it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady, DS</li>
    <li> Their products fall apart!!!!!!!!!!!  And if you buy from their site they tell you that your card didn&#x27;t go through when it clearly did!</li>
    <li> After reading so much about this eGlide I was sold that it was just what I needed. After all those years of shaving I thought I had finally found something to make life so much easier and the task of removing unwanted hair less time consuming. I guess the best description I can give this product is all Hype and NO Action. A real disappointment!!!</li>
    <li> was not effective. Everything was as described except for the lack of results.  May work for some, didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> All those who are claiming &#x27;sham&#x27; on this device probably do not understand the electrolysis process. The US government is VERY strict on products claiming &#x27;permanent hair removal&#x27;. I am a TG and I know a thing or five about unwanted facial hair. I went through 2 years of costly electrolysis, with very little long term success, because I didn&#x27;t know the difference between thermolysis and galvanic processes. What you receive from this device is a severely hampered galvanic treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the misunderstood science behind the destruction of hair folicles. It is NOT the electrical charge, nor the heat that it generates, that kills the roots. What the electricty does, is to excite the water molecules in the bulb of the folicle, which causes a chemical reaction, thereby seperating the water molecules and converting them into sodium hydroxide (lye) It is the corrosive properties of this chemical compound which permanently destroy the folicle. This is also why products like &#x27;Nair&#x27; remove hair at the surface. Don&#x27;t believe me, then look it up! If you understand all of that, then you must realize that this thing is going to take a REAL LONG time to achieve ANY result at all. You can&#x27;t just whisk it across your face like a quick shave, and expect to be smooth and free for a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s my personal experience with the product. I have used it about 15 times on my upper lip. I&#x27;d like to use it more, but i pretty much need to shave daily for my job, and don&#x27;t get the opportunity to get enough growth so that i can tweeze the hair afterwords. i have CONSIDERABLY less dense stubble throughout the treated area. I used to let it grow in for a few days about once every 3 months so that i could tweeze the entire area. Otherwise, the area would just become too rough to maintain a feminine appearance. I haven&#x27;t had to do that in over a year now, because of the NOTICABLE improvement I have experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product (and I&#x27;m sure there will be many better followers to come), is probably going to make professional electrlysis obsolete, but it&#x27;s going to TAKE SOME TIME! Unfortunately, this thing is cheaply made, and sometimes my &#x27;contact&#x27; light doesn&#x27;t come on, but it still appears to be doing the job. The science behind it gets a &#x27;five&#x27; ...  and i can&#x27;t wait until higher quality devices begin to show up to replace the &#x27;three&#x27; rating that i had to give to this particular product.y better followers to come), is probably going to make professional electrlysis obsolete, but it&#x27;s going to TAKE SOME TIME!

    <li> The good news is on my last week of use I dropped it in the toilet and after taking it apart and letting it dry out over night it still worked! Although that probably just tells you how simple and non extensive this thing is and it probably takes alot more than this to permanently remove hair. Any way im a guy with an average amount of chest and stomach hair to get rid of. My stomach I waxed and shaved while my chest I just shaved while using the e-glide. I did contact verso asking if the e-glide would still work if you just stick with shaving, and they said it would it will just may take a little longer. Well after using it on my stomach 3-4days a week and 6 times a week on my chest for 3 months I have.........not noticed a single bare patch of skin while regrowth rate and thickness remained the same. I think they&#x27;ve got a GREAT idea with roller electrolysis however I dont think this flimsy little thing is powerful enough to do much at all for most people. Yes I know it should take more than 3 months to achieve good results but after 3months and nothing at all I think I can safely say this will not work me. If you seriously want at home permanent hair loss I would (and am) look into a more powerful device. People in my case with lots of hair to get rid of might be interested in at home laser or ipl devices such as, the tria laser, or the silk&#x27;n senspil, or remington ilight just to name a few. My last words would be keep an eye out for an improved version of roller electrolysis but pass on the e-glide, only giving it 2 stars because it survived a plunge in the toilet.</li>
    <li> Ordered This Item For My Mom And She Said She Loved It, Works Where It Is Needed And Very light</li>
    <li> Since electrolysis is so expensive I thought this might be a good alternative but the product didn&#x27;t work and I missed the return deadline by a week or two</li>
    <li> I never saw any lessening of hair in any part that I treated.</li>
    <li> I did some research after using this a few times and even hooking it up to a multimeter, the output is nowhere near enough to kill hair follicles.  All this does is circulate low level DC voltage through your skin.  It does not stop hair growth.  What this product does not tell you up front is you have to tweeze every single hair after every use, and the very nature of tweezing your hair that many times in a row will make your hair thinner because hair grows in stages.  Bottom line:  save your money and have a professional with a lifetime guarantee remove unwanted hair.  Unfortunately, this is not one of those things that you can do yourself or cheap out on.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that does what it says it will.  I have a drawer full of gadgets and waxes.  Every time I saw a product that said it would work to remove facial hair I bought it.  Verseo is the least expensive product I have purchased and have gotten the best results.  I carefully studied the directions and started on my mission to rid my face of hair.  I have only been using this for three weeks ( 5 days / week) and I have already seen remarkable results.  There is definely a reduction in hair.  I do one section at a time and focus on careful tweezing to remove the hairs.  It is very time consuming.  The gliding is the least of the time I spend.  The tweezing is the time consuming part.  I did not like the tweezers that came in the set.  I found it too difficult to use.  I use my own Tweezerman. I also found that if I roll a section and then roll another section giving the first a chance to do its thing and then went back and did the tweezing, it was easier to remove the hairs.  Keeping the tweezer clean while tweezing helps too.  I have never had a problem with burns on my fingers as others have said.  I just keep my fingers damp.  I have only used the face setting on my face.  I will never part with my Verseo.  I forsee my problem finally being solved.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this thing for 10 months now for my facial hair, upper lip and chin.  I&#x27;ve become very frustrated that after 10 months now of what I think is \\&quot;regular use\\&quot; I honestly can&#x27;t say if I&#x27;ve had a reduction of hair growth or not.  Whenever my hair starts to grow back, I use the eglide again, so I don&#x27;t know how fully the hair would grow back if I were to let it go.  Is that what I&#x27;m doing wrong, waiting too long between applications? Should I be using it before the hair grows back for it to be effective? I&#x27;ve been using it about once a week or every 2 weeks.  I want this thing to work so badly, and that&#x27;s why I haven&#x27;t given up yet, but I&#x27;m starting to feel like my determination is just insane behavior, and should maybe come to terms with the fact that I was thoroughly ripped off.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m more upset about the fact I&#x27;m out $99, the wasted countless hours, or the fact that I still have facial hair without any kind of solution that I can afford.  Can anyone give me some guidance?</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my sister so I cannot write much on it I can only say that she is very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I would have to say that the eGlide works to a point. however in order for it to work it takes a very long time. It takes many weeks in order to remove the hair. even though it said it would take a long time I didn&#x27;t think it would take this long. I would not recommend getting the product if you would like your hair to be removed fast on your legs, underarms, and feet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m slightly skeptical.  I think it must take a long time of daily use to see a difference in hair removal.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT WORK. DID NOT REMOVE HAIR.WOULD LIKE TO RETURN IT. XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX</li>
    <li> Verseo (on their website) states &#x27;100% satisfaction guaranteed no hassle returns and easy exchanges&#x27;. Having used the product and finding it burning the skin we contacted the company and they returned our email stating the product was still in warranty and that if we returned the item they would send us a refund. We have this in an email...&lt;br /&gt;Later they sent another email stating that since we did not purchase the item through their company directly we were only eligible for a replacement even though they previously stated they would refund the payment if that was what we wanted. If the item is being returned because it burns the skin, why would we want a replacement?&lt;br /&gt;When we returned the item they advised us to get a shipping receipt (we returned it via UPS) which cost us money not them. They definitely received the return and here we are weeks later going from one email to the next and getting nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;Once again, please DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend buying this product. I bought it for my daughter and it did absolutely nothing at all.</li>
