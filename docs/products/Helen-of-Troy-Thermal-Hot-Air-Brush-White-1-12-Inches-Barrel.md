      <li>Too hot, Too stiff-PAINFUL!</li>

      <li>I wish the warm setting was the same speed as hot and cool.</li>

      <li>I start out on the hot setting then switch to cool setting because the hot is too hot on my scalp.</li>
      <li>It provides the soft curl I like for the fine hair that I have.  </li>
      <li>Revlon&#x27;s hot air brushes instead.</li>
      <li>The first one died in a fire.</li>
      <li>This air brush works like magic on my short curly hair.</li>
      <li>A smaller barrel works better.</li>
      <li>I love it and plan to buy a second one.</li>
      <li>I love this for short hair.</li>
      <li>THAT ARE MORE LIKE A REGULAR BRUSH.SOFTER  </li>
      <li>I have been searching for a product like this since Revlon abandoned us short-haired seniors and instead made larger, heavier curling irons more suited to teenagers.  </li>
      <li>JOHN FREIDA HAS A HOT AIR BRUSH THAT HAS THE SOFTER BRISTLES</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the 3/4\\&quot; air brush, gives me just the right curl in second.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and its short; so this hot air brush worked extremely well in giving my hair more body and shape.</li>
      <li>I really like the convenience and versatility of this hot air brush.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very thin/fine, and quite unruly.</li>
      <li>It makes it MUCH easier.</li>
      <li>It really does give my hair body.  </li>
      <li>THAT I REALLY LIKE.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve previously bought the John Freida one &amp; LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this one for my Mom &amp;</li>
      <li>I had a stroke and have no use of my right arm/hand so a regular curling iron does not work for me.</li>
      <li>FOR A QUICK DRY AND WAVE</li>
      <li>but I did not think it was hot enough</li>
      <li>This is my second Helen of Troy Hot Air Brush.</li>
      <li>so much I wanted to have the second on hand in case</li>
      <li>and then it stopped completely.</li>
      <li>The circumference of the handle is a little large, not as easy to manuever as the last one which was a tad smaller.</li>
      <li>It got to me less than two full days after I ordered it..</li>
      <li>I have very fine thin hair.  </li>
      <li>The problem is not enough heat/power to combat my natural wave.</li>
      <li>Not at all what I expected it does not get hot enough and</li>
      <li>Helen of Troy has done it again and as usually the price is super also.</li>
      <li>Larger overall than I thought, but not heavy.</li>
      <li>The curl-release button does not work very well, and the other day, while on low setting, the thing just stopped running.</li>
      <li>One of the few 3/4\\&quot; barrel hot air brush.  </li>
      <li>It cuts in half the time it takes to get my hair ready for the day.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone, especially those with fine, thin hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It function well enough, and seems sturdy, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold the hair in place/  The bristles somehow miss the mark</li>
    <li> Not as good as my older one, but the best that is available now.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and its short; so this hot air brush worked extremely well in giving my hair more body and shape.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago. The low setting sounded like the product was low on battery power, but I gave it a try. The curl-release button does not work very well, and the other day, while on low setting, the thing just stopped running. It is frustrating to use.</li>
    <li> This is my second Helen of Troy Hot Air Brush. The first one died in a fire. I start out on the hot setting then switch to cool setting because the hot is too hot on my scalp. I wish the warm setting was the same speed as hot and cool. I suggest for those whose air brush will quit because it gets too hot to switch to cool setting. I just love my Helen of Troy Hot Air Brush!</li>
    <li> I love my now hot air brush! it has just the right size barrel. I had a stroke and have no use of my right arm/hand so a regular curling iron does not work for me. This is very easy to use and does a great job at styling my hair. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Good power.  One of the few 3/4\\&quot; barrel hot air brush.  Works great for shorter hair.</li>
    <li> What I expected but this newer model does not let you remove the brush head for cleaning.</li>
    <li> First of all I chose this product because I have had Helen of Troy products for many, many years.  I will just add another product to the list of things I love.  I have very fine thin hair.  It really does give my hair body.  I was so excited when I first tried it.  I would recommend this product to anyone, especially those with fine, thin hair.  Helen of Troy has done it again and as usually the price is super also.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected it does not get hot enough and hair does get tangled.  It is also very clumsy to use.</li>
    <li> Looked for some time to find an air brush instead of a curling iron.  It is just the right size for my hair. Works great. We are going to Europe and it will not run on the 240v current there. Some hair tools will run on 110 v or 240 v, but this one is 110 v only. I am still happy to have it for use here.</li>
    <li> Larger overall than I thought, but not heavy. I&#x27;d guess about 15&amp;#34; long. I wanted something I could use one handed, as I have weakness in my left hand which makes holding a blow dryer difficult. In that light, this unit fits the bill. Barrel is a perfect size for short hair. Swivel cord works well. Easy to twirl into hair, even one handed. The problem is not enough heat/power to combat my natural wave. My hair is very thin/fine, and quite unruly. Brush picks up hair easily, holds and releases OK, but the unit is just too wimpy to fight mother nature in my case.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a product like this since Revlon abandoned us short-haired seniors and instead made larger, heavier curling irons more suited to teenagers.  The Helen of Troy is smaller, lightweight, travels well and the 3/4&amp;#34; barrel is perfect for short wiry hair.</li>
    <li> The brush pulled my mom&#x27;s hair out.</li>
    <li> Too hot, Too stiff-PAINFUL! Hair gets caught in it-RIPS OUT! I&#x27;ve previously bought the John Freida one &amp; LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this one for my Mom &amp; we&#x27;re both thoroughly disappointed. Return is limited to 30 days, so now I&#x27;m stuck with&lt;br /&gt;it &amp; am out $25.00!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Does NOT rotate nor &amp;#34;removable barrel&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I really like the convenience and versatility of this hot air brush.  It cuts in half the time it takes to get my hair ready for the day.  It is handy, easy to use, lightweight and was priced reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Size was perfect for my hair length but I did not think it was hot enough so I sent it back.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GOOD AIR BRUSH EXCEPT I REALLY WASN&#x27;T THRILLED WITH THE BRUSH BRISTLES . I LIKE THE BRISTLES THAT ARE MORE LIKE A REGULAR BRUSH.SOFTER  NOT SO BRISTLY . JOHN FREIDA HAS A HOT AIR BRUSH THAT HAS THE SOFTER BRISTLES THAT I REALLY LIKE. ALAS HE DOESN&#x27;T MAKE A 3/4 INCH BARREL THAT I NEEDED FOR MY SIDES.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS AIR BRUSH ALOT.  I HAD IT BEFORE AND I GAVE IT AWAY.  I BORROWED IT FROM THE PERSON AND DECIDED TO ORDER ANOTHER ONE.  THE ONLY THING IS THIS ONE CAME IN A LITTLE LARGER THAN THE ORGINAL.  I FINALLY TRIED TO RETURN  IT BUT I WAITED TO LONGER.  IF ONLY THE BRUSH CAME IN 1/2&amp;#34;.  MY QUESTION IS THERE A DIFFERENTS BETWEEN 1559 MODEL AND THE 1559V1.  I DID ORDER THE 1559 AND RECEIVED THE 1559V1.</li>
    <li> Perfect for short straight hair - love this hot air brush.  Works great, packs and travels well too.</li>
    <li> I love it and plan to buy a second one. It&#x27;s easy to use and the 3/4\\&quot; air brush, gives me just the right curl in second.</li>
    <li> Great on my very fine hair.  doesn&#x27;t get tangled.  adds some needed body in a few minutes.I would recommend. Good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve written a review already. The product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> The minute I turned it on it started to smell like it was burning and then it stopped completely. Might have been a defective item or it might just be a piece of junk.&lt;br /&gt;The seller was very nice about it and issued a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;Try Revlon&#x27;s hot air brushes instead.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in this curling brush.  It takes a lot longer to dry and curl my hair.  Ended up going back to my hair dryer and separate curling iron.</li>
    <li> Great idea to combine a brush with hot air that dries damp hair. It provides the soft curl I like for the fine hair that I have.  It does not handle wet hair well, so I partially dry my hair with a regular hair drier and then use it for the final  drying/curling.</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money, since it does not work. Tried waiting for it to heat up, after 20 minutes gave up. Would return it, but it will cost me more in time, I&#x27;d rather call it buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I love this for short hair. Very easy to slip in a bag for traveling. Soft bristles are better for the hair.</li>
    <li> I like this for the money. I was under the impression that when the description said it swiveled, that the body of it did too and not just the top. It works fine and if you don&#x27;t want anything fancy that is affordable, I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The product states it is a rotating brush and it does not rotate the way I could figure out how to use it and I asked about 5 other people and they could not figure it out either.  it was a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> It was perfect.  I have short hair and the bigger hot air brushes are not effective. A smaller barrel works better.</li>
    <li> I always buy these - they last a long time and get the job done.  I hope they never stop making them!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet because this is my second one and haven&#x27;t needed to use it.  But I really liked my first one so much I wanted to have the second on hand in case I needed it.</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product if you&#x27;re not good at styling your hair like your beautician does....It makes it MUCH easier. Couldn&#x27;t face the world without it.  SO happy Amazon stocks it. It got to me less than two full days after I ordered it..</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE GO TO FOR A QUICK DRY AND WAVE..IF YOU HAVE SHORT HAIR IT WILL NOT GIVE YOU CURLS, MORE LIKE WAVES, THIS IS THE 2 ONE IN 5 YEARS</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous hot air brush.  The wire bristles hold the hair without any tangling.  You can get a smooth look, body, curls, whatever style you want. I was so glad to find I can still get this product I bought 5 just in case they would ever be discontinued!!😄</li>
    <li> This air brush works like magic on my short curly hair. It drys quickly and never over heats.</li>
    <li> My hair is short, so I probable should have got only a 1/2inch one, if they make one!  Other than ithat, it is great!</li>
    <li> This item was useless, plugged it in and started smoking and then died</li>
    <li> I like this dryer, though not as much as my last Helen of Troy.The circumference of the handle is a little large, not as easy to manuever as the last one which was a tad smaller. The jury is still out on the flexible bristles vs.the rigid plastic ones.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, short, fine hair and I found my hair tangling and pulling out hair with this brush.  Also, the box showed a different model but the air brush was 1559.  I could not figure out how the barrel could be removed and cleaned.  Anyway, I decided it was not for me and returned it.  I think it might work with thicker hair.</li>
    <li> my wife says this is the best hot air brush she has ever used .. product description is perfect .... will buy more in future</li>
    <li> Broke after only six uses</li>
</ol>
