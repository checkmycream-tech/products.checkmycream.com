      <li>A sure winner!</li>
      <li>but I still own it and use it at times.  </li>
      <li>Although this is a nice smelling musk.</li>
      <li>Not my kind.</li>
      <li>Excellent smelling classic from Jovan.</li>
      <li>this product has a very cheap smell.  </li>
      <li>It was kind of too strong of a smell for me.</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed Jovan Musk for many years.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had more drinks thrown in my face.</li>
      <li>I loved it and it has a fresh cirus fragrence.</li>
      <li>This product has a scent which smells better after 5 or so minutes.  </li>
      <li>The package is appealing and application is easier compared to others.</li>
      <li>This is one of his favorite colognes.</li>
      <li>I love the scent.</li>
      <li>I prefer the orginal better.</li>
      <li>The scent is very nice, but too much can be quite overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I liked Jovan&#x27;s original musk.</li>
      <li>Ok, but don&#x27;t jive with my body chemistry like the original</li>
      <li>...and so far it&#x27;s been completely successful.</li>
      <li>A BIT CHEAP.</li>
      <li>So I guess its all relevant.  </li>
      <li>Smells okay, but good smells only lasts for 40min max?  </li>
      <li>Neither too mild, nor too strong...</li>
      <li>Having tried neither, but knowing about its original product, I opted accordingly.  </li>
      <li>NOT BAD</li>
      <li>I like this one, but I wish it would last longer with a more potent scent to it.  </li>
      <li>His new favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>Christmas present for my husband, but I wear it more!</li>
      <li>It has a classic masculine smell, that is not tear jerking but pleasant to be around (unless too much is used).</li>
      <li>He was surprised by the scent and he love it...</li>
      <li>Still way worth the money</li>
      <li>Just right</li>
      <li>I typically buy him the original version, but this one smells just as nice.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product at a reasonable price verse the overly expensive ones.  </li>
      <li>Others males in house have made positive comments about smell.</li>
      <li>Not too good small doesn&#x27;t stay longer</li>
      <li>Presents itself a bit strong initially but then softens and stay with you throughout the evening, though hinting of its original application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the three, this was my least favorite</li>
      <li>But it didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
      <li>Next time, I may invest a few bucks more and see if I can get a better product; no complaints about the product and its almost over now.</li>
      <li>Got this for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
      <li>Just not as often as the White Musk and Original.</li>
      <li>Smells great and only a small amount needed.</li>
      <li>This Joavan Musk Black has a subdued and satisfying fragrance.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on a cologne, however wanted a decent cologne and this serves my purpose.</li>
      <li>Complimenrs from friends, family or female acquaintences will get a very high recommendation from me.</li>
      <li>Jovan has always done Musk well &amp; this is an unusual one- definitely musk, but with floral earth undertones.</li>
      <li>When I purchased the original Jovan Musk, I was offered a &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; which included bottles of Black Musk and White Musk.  </li>
      <li>Its not a bad scent, just not strong enough.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have tried the Black Musk.  </li>
      <li>This new Black Musk seems to be watered down and doesn&#x27;t last very well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Although this is a nice smelling musk. I prefer the orginal better. The scent was underwhelming. Its not a bad scent, just not strong enough.</li>
    <li> My husband wears this and it is yummy. I can&#x27;t stay close to him long enough when he wears it.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed Jovan Musk for many years.  This is the first time I have tried the Black Musk.  A great fragrance.</li>
    <li> ...and so far it&#x27;s been completely successful. I often travel throughout the US, and the last time I was in Cincinnati I went to a few clubs with this cologne on. I&#x27;ve never had more drinks thrown in my face. This is the perfect douche cologne! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> The price is to buy for, great value there. The scent is very nice, but too much can be quite overwhelming. It has a classic masculine smell, that is not tear jerking but pleasant to be around (unless too much is used). If I ever run out, I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Smells okay, but good smells only lasts for 40min max?  After that time passes, cologne starts to smell very bad.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband.  I typically buy him the original version, but this one smells just as nice.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on a cologne, however wanted a decent cologne and this serves my purpose. Next time, I may invest a few bucks more and see if I can get a better product; no complaints about the product and its almost over now.</li>
    <li> I was so used to regular Jovan Musk and I could barely smell what I wear everyday. So, I bought this one. It was kind of too strong of a smell for me. No. Not my kind.</li>
    <li> Nice price, great value. Excellent smelling classic from Jovan. Always a great stand-by when you just don&#x27;t know what to wear for the evening. A sure winner!</li>
    <li> Neither too mild, nor too strong... Just right</li>
    <li> This Joavan Musk Black has a subdued and satisfying fragrance. The package is appealing and application is easier compared to others. It invites favorable comments and enquiries as to what it is from aquaintances.</li>
    <li> this product has a very cheap smell.  But it didn&#x27;t cost much. So I guess its all relevant.  So if cost is the bigger issue for you over scent.  Then this may be for you.</li>
    <li> I liked Jovan&#x27;s original musk. Thought it lasted well and was a good value. This new Black Musk seems to be watered down and doesn&#x27;t last very well.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy. I love the scent. It is different. I never owned a product like this one.</li>
    <li> Not too good small doesn&#x27;t stay longer</li>

    <li> Christmas present for my husband, but I wear it more!</li>
    <li> I like this one, but I wish it would last longer with a more potent scent to it.  Still way worth the money</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad.  This is one of his favorite colognes.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this- Jovan has always done Musk well &amp; this is an unusual one- definitely musk, but with floral earth undertones.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very good fragrance, I am very happy with the purchase and the price is pretty good.In my next purchase I&#x27;ll have in mind.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my son. He likes Musk to start with. Smells great and only a small amount needed.His new favorite cologne. Others males in house have made positive comments about smell. I know what to buy for gifts now.  He is very happy with this item. Therefore I am happy with the item and the purchase.</li>

    <li> Got this for my husband and he really likes it. This is an excellent product at a reasonable price verse the overly expensive ones.  I would buy it again from this seller.</li>
    <li> It is just a great product. The smell is great. I will continue to use this product. My advice is to try it.</li>
    <li> Ok, but don&#x27;t jive with my body chemistry like the original</li>
    <li> NOT BAD BUT THIS ONE SMELLS A BIT CHEAP.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchase this Jovan Black Musk as a gift to my Dad... He was surprised by the scent and he love it...</li>
    <li> Wonderful.  I loved it and it has a fresh cirus fragrence.</li>
