      <li>me, the SPF 8 is a good &amp;#</li>
      <li>Works, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t leave you oily.</li>
      <li>Nice lotion, great Hawaiian Tropic scent- absorbs nicely without an oily or sticky feel.</li>
      <li>Even my husband, who doesn&#x27;t like the feel of sunscreens (either too oily or too sticky) liked the smoothness of this one.</li>
      <li>I have always used Hawaiian Tropics and love it.  </li>
      <li>Cocoa or coconut scent would be better.</li>
      <li>I like this lotion much better than others that I have tried</li>
      <li>I love this product - have used it for years.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and how it feels on my face.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff :-)</li>
      <li>Hawaiian Tropic is definitely my most favorite.  </li>
      <li>it would&#x27;ve been better if I hadn&#x27;t used this.</li>
      <li>Goes on like most lotions without leaving an oily feel.</li>
      <li>but I think I&#x27;ve found a better alternative.</li>
      <li>very light-not greasy feels good on your skin-use it every day when a higher SPF isn&#x27;t needed and has that great Hawaiian Tropic fragrance.</li>
      <li>This tanning lotion is very good but it leaves white smears all over your skin.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this product for our beach vacation and liked it so much that I ordered more.</li>
      <li>The lotion seems to work fine.</li>
      <li>I am light skinned but tan easy.  </li>
      <li>I can also usually find great prices on Amazon!  </li>
      <li>Good product with enough spf.</li>
      <li>I rarely ever burn with or with out sun screen or tanning lotion, I just tan, I am bright red and in pain.</li>
      <li>I spend a lot of time outdoors and this works well as long as you give a good 15 minutes for it to soak in.</li>
      <li>Now I drive a convertible and have a patio that gets direct sunlight most of the year, so I need sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>although I rarely burn unless over-exposed).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always my first choice when it comes to sun screen.</li>
      <li>I have mostly Eastern European with some Mediterranean ancestry.</li>
      <li>Notably, the SPF 4 has retinyl palmitate, which has been shown (in large quantities) to actually increase the risk of skin cancer.</li>
      <li>Because I&#x27;ve been in the acquatics world for most my life, I have always tried new and different brands of lotion.  </li>
      <li>; It&#x27;s possible the SPF 6 didn&#x27;t meet the requirements for this label, so Hawaiian Tropic just discontinued it and figured the SPF 4 was fine for those who don&#x27;t care about sun-induced premature aging.</li>

      <li>The SPF 4, 6, and 8 also have the same rich cocoa butter/coconut oil smell, whereas the Ultra Radiance has a very floral, feminine smell.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t sweat off easily like other brands</li>
      <li>As I get older, I tend to use the SPF at a higher effectiveness, but now I will go as low as SPF 8.</li>
      <li>I live in the Caribbean, I took this to the beach,  </li>
      <li>The SPF 4 also contains oxybenzone, which has also been shown (also in large quantities) to mimic estrogen and disrupt endocrine function (but the concentration is so low compared to high-SPF sunscreens it probably doesn&#x27;t matter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wish it had been clear.</li>
      <li>Having said that, I purchased this Hawaiian Tropic lotion with a low SPF factor and was really blown away by how well it worked.</li>
      <li>Plus, when you smell it and makes you feel like you are on some Hawaiian island far away.  </li>
      <li>For one; it smelled great, secondly it didn&#x27;t go on as thick as paste, and lastly it protected me enough so that I could get some color without burning (</li>
      <li>Whether the SPF is low or high, it always does the job.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find suntan lotions with lower SPFs, I&#x27;ve only been able to find this on Amazon, not in the stores.</li>
      <li>generally use SPF 4 or 6, but I use this sunscreen on very sunny days or long drives, or the day after a lot of sun exposure.</li>
      <li>My skin was left feeling very soft and nourished.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For background, I&#x27;ve used Hawaiian Tropic SPF 4 Tanning Lotion Sunscreen, Broad Spectrum SPF 6 Sheer Touch Lotion Sunscreen, Broad Spectrum SPF 8 Lotion Sunscreen, and Broad Spectrum SPF 15 Ultra Radiance Sheer Touch Lotion Sunscreen.</li>
      <li>The only tanning lotion that gives a &amp;#34;Miami&amp;#34; natural tann to my white skin.</li>
      <li>only difference between the SPF 6 and SPF 8 Hawaiian Tropic Sheer Touch sunscreens is a slightly higher concentration of active ingredient octocrylene (1.0% vs. 0.7%).</li>

<li> The SPF 4, 6, and 8 come in the same dark brown bottle, whereas the the SPF 15 Ultra Radiance comes in a beige bottle and the flower illustration is shiny.</li>
<li> The SPF 4 is the thickest and has a slightly stronger smell, with the SPF 6 and 8 the same medium thickness/smell, and the SPF 15 the runniest.</li>
<li> To be expected with # 8.  </li>
<li> Every other ingredient is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Active ingredient comparison:  SPF 4: 1.0% octocrylene, 0.5% oxybenzone SPF 6: 0.7% octocrylene, 0.5% avobenzone (this product) SPF 8: 1.0% octocrylene, 0.5% avobenzone.</li>
<li> I moved to California a year ago for the sunshine because I&#x27;m usually vitamin D deficient and got depressed in New York winters.</li>
<li> /&gt;There are a few differences between this and the SPF 4 Tanning Lotion.</li>
<li> I have always used Hawaiian Tropic products for tanning, usually the dark tanning  spf 4.</li>
<li> I you can give this less of a star I would!</li>
<li> I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this product.  </li>
<li> I will never use this again, money wasted!</li>
<li> I would only recommend this to those with a base tan or who don&#x27;t burn in the sun.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Hawaiian Tropic.  </li>
<li> this bad boy on to protect your skin.</li>
<li> Was disappointed that I could not find number 4 &amp; 6 of this product.</li>
<li> This is terrible!</li>

    <li> I have always used Hawaiian Tropics and love it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy, and it smells so good!  I order products like this from Amazon instead of going to the store for convenience.  I can also usually find great prices on Amazon!  I would definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> Works, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t leave you oily. Perfect for the day outdoors.</li>
    <li> Good product with enough spf.</li>
    <li> Excellent for people with sallow or darker skin who don&#x27;t need a ton of sun protection. It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find suntan lotions with lower SPFs, I&#x27;ve only been able to find this on Amazon, not in the stores. Smells like summer in the 1980s, stays on in the pool, A++ would tan again!</li>
    <li> The only tanning lotion that gives a &amp;#34;Miami&amp;#34; natural tann to my white skin. It&#x27;s grease and smell like &amp;#34;vacations&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> When it&#x27;s sunny slap this bad boy on to protect your skin. I love the smell and how it feels on my face.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion, great Hawaiian Tropic scent- absorbs nicely without an oily or sticky feel.</li>
    <li> used this for years its the best!</li>
    <li> Smells great!  I am light skinned but tan easy.  I was out in mid 80 degree weather for several hours and burned.  To be expected with # 8.  I like this lotion much better than others that I have tried and I recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product - have used it for years. Was disappointed that I could not find number 4 &amp; 6 of this product. I like to use all 3 depending on the time of day and time of year.</li>
    <li> Always good to have in your pack.</li>
    <li> I know that any kind of UV exposure is bad but I am an outdoorsy person and refuse to avoid the sun at all costs. Having said that, I purchased this Hawaiian Tropic lotion with a low SPF factor and was really blown away by how well it worked. For one; it smelled great, secondly it didn&#x27;t go on as thick as paste, and lastly it protected me enough so that I could get some color without burning (although I rarely burn unless over-exposed). My skin was left feeling very soft and nourished. I used to spend a ton of money on sun care products but I think I&#x27;ve found a better alternative. This is a great product for a great price. I would only recommend this to those with a base tan or who don&#x27;t burn in the sun. All others use with caution.</li>
    <li> very light-not greasy feels good on your skin-use it every day when a higher SPF isn&#x27;t needed and has that great Hawaiian Tropic fragrance.</li>
    <li> 40% off compared to Walgreens</li>
    <li> I have mostly Eastern European with some Mediterranean ancestry. I&#x27;m pale without sun exposure but tan very well (skin type 4, maybe 3.5). I moved to California a year ago for the sunshine because I&#x27;m usually vitamin D deficient and got depressed in New York winters. Now I drive a convertible and have a patio that gets direct sunlight most of the year, so I need sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally use SPF 4 or 6, but I use this sunscreen on very sunny days or long drives, or the day after a lot of sun exposure.

The SPF 4, 6, and 8 also have the same rich cocoa butter/coconut oil smell, whereas the Ultra Radiance has a very floral, feminine smell. The SPF 4 is the thickest and has a slightly stronger smell, with the SPF 6 and 8 the same medium thickness/smell, and the SPF 15 the runniest. Because of the smell and consistency, I&#x27;m not a fan of the SPF 15 at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference between the SPF 6 and SPF 8 Hawaiian Tropic Sheer Touch sunscreens is a slightly higher concentration of active ingredient octocrylene (1.0% vs. 0.7%).

Even my husband, who doesn&#x27;t like the feel of sunscreens (either too oily or too sticky) liked the smoothness of this one. Protected us well since we already had a good base tan. I will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> I always use this. I spend a lot of time outdoors and this works well as long as you give a good 15 minutes for it to soak in. Doesn&#x27;t sweat off easily like other brands</li>
    <li> The lotion seems to work fine. Goes on like most lotions without leaving an oily feel. Big drawback is the smell. Kinda citrusy and not my thing. Cocoa or coconut scent would be better.</li>
    <li> This is terrible! I have always used Hawaiian Tropic products for tanning, usually the dark tanning  spf 4. I live in the Caribbean, I took this to the beach,  it would&#x27;ve been better if I hadn&#x27;t used this. I rarely ever burn with or with out sun screen or tanning lotion, I just tan, I am bright red and in pain. I will never use this again, money wasted! I you can give this less of a star I would!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is very good but it leaves white smears all over your skin.  Wish it had been clear.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Hawaiian Tropic.  It&#x27;s always my first choice when it comes to sun screen.</li>
    <li> Because I&#x27;ve been in the acquatics world for most my life, I have always tried new and different brands of lotion.  Hawaiian Tropic is definitely my most favorite.  Whether the SPF is low or high, it always does the job.  Plus, when you smell it and makes you feel like you are on some Hawaiian island far away.  This is always a good thing.  I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this product.  It has been nothing but good for me.  As I get older, I tend to use the SPF at a higher effectiveness, but now I will go as low as SPF 8. I love this stuff :-)</li>
