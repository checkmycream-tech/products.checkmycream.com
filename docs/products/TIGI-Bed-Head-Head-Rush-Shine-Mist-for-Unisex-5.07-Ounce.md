<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I buy this exact product in the salon for double the price. It works so well as a heat protector if you flat iron your hair! When I saw the price I had to purchase</li>
    <li> I use this when I let my hair stay curly, and it keeps it from looking like a frizzy disaster, and it has a sweet scent to it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  It smells very good and leaves my hair nice and shiny!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Once you spray it on, you see the shine immediately. It is light weight and not sticky at all. I wash my hair every other day. If I use this shine mist the first day of washing my hair, there is no detectable residue the next day. I highly recommend you try this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and love it. But the smell is completely different in this bottle compared to all others prior. It makes me a little suspicious of the source (seller)? Not sure what happened but I&#x27;m hoping I just got a dud or old bottle and that TIGI didn&#x27;t change the formula. Otherwise, I love this product. I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars since I can&#x27;t be sure what the problem is.</li>
    <li> Word of advice: use in a well-ventilated room or you may die of asphyxiation. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge increase in shine after using this product. The smell is nice but that&#x27;s the best thing about it.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks!!!  The shine you get is unmatched by any other product I have ever used.  My hair looks fabulous after I use this &amp; I always get comments on how good my hair looks.  I am a blond &amp; when applied my hair shines like \\&quot;spun gold\\&quot;.  Note: you will not be able to take this in your carry on: TSA rule: they will confiscate it.</li>
    <li> I absolutley love this product! I always use it after straightening or curling my hair and it makes my hair shine</li>
    <li> Expected better from this brand.  I prefer Umberto shine spray that I can get at Target.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all.  I ended up throwing it away.  I used the BigSexyHair shine spray but wanted something a little more affordable.  The only thing this did was cloud up my bathroom from the spray.  I don&#x27;t think any even stuck to my hair.  I could not tell a difference at all.  There was absolutely no shine.  I ended up trying Fruitis spray for under $4.  It is amazing.  As good as BigSexyHair.</li>
    <li> Great product, works well- last thing I put on before going out the door. Helps on the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair to still look clean and shiny.</li>
    <li> This product is great for hair that doesn&#x27;t like humidity! And the bottle lasts me almost an entire year. I couldn&#x27;t leave the house on a rainy day without it.</li>
    <li> The product does what it says.  It leaves a shine but I have found for my blond processed hair it leaves a greasy residue.</li>
    <li> Love the sleek shine and how smooth it makes my hair look and feel. QUICK shipping and GREAT PRICE all through Amazon!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look shiny without looking oily. Feels very light on my hair and is a nice embellishment if I want my hair to look particularly bright.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, have recently gone &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; (read gray) and find my hair is somewhat dull, this product makes it look so shiny and healthy. I get compliments on how pretty my hair is all the time!</li>
    <li> my hair feels so good</li>
    <li> I buy this product from my salon and use it on a daily basis.  However, I believe this item that I ordered was outdated - it had a terrible smell, and left my hair greasy.  I will never order this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to use a whole lot of hair product; I&#x27;ll usually set my hair with a quick spray or two of hair spray and call it a day. So this product is perfect for me. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair all that shiny, though I&#x27;m sure it would if you use the right amount. And the hold is flexible, so it makes your hair still touchable. And, it smells awesome.</li>
    <li> Just ordered more, a great product for shine.  Smell is good.  Doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot to get a nice look.</li>
    <li> This product is a small hair miracle in a spray can. It smells so amazing and makes my hair shine like no other product I&#x27;ve tried. Most of the other products weigh my hair down and make it look oily. Not this product. It&#x27;s super light weight on your hair and instantly makes it feel soft.</li>
    <li> Shines your hair nice</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is delicious!!  And it gives my hair a really beautiful shimmer.  I also loved the price.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> It is okay, but I&#x27;ve had much better shine sprays.  This one gives okay shine and absolutely no change at all to your hair texture.  I was looking for something that gave more of a silken feel to your hair.  This one is shine, and shine alone.</li>
    <li> Great smell and seems to make my hair shine!  I like to use a spray of it everyday as it seems helpful when combing hair as long as mine.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS BEEN USING FOR YEARS CANT BEAT THE PRICE . SMELLS SO GOOD AND DOESNT WEIGH HAIR DOWN .</li>
    <li> Buy it for family member</li>
    <li> Love to use this to finish up my hair style. The shine is very fine not any big chunks of glitter just a nice sheen. Leaves a faint sweet scent to hair. Controls fly always. Nice pick me up for threw out the day if you need a little shine in your life</li>
    <li> Works well and smells wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. My hair stylist used this on me but I couldn&#x27;t find it at any beauty supply place here in Phoenix so I went online and found it on amazon.  It is a wonderful product and really has added a lot of shine to my hair but does not weigh it down like a stay in product might.</li>
    <li> I have a Lisa Rinna/Meg Ryan short-ish shag (thx, Sally @ T&amp;G Tampa). My thinning, over 50 hair can get dull from blond highlights, gray streaks and the molding paste I use to piece out the ends. I spray Head Rush for a soft, youthful shine without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For extra bounce---blow dry hair upside down w/fingers until 95% dry. Next, stand up and LIGHTLY spray Head Rush Shine all over (pick up a few random pieces and spray underside for a dimensional look)...LIGHTLY. SPRAY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, use a 2&amp;#34; round brush w/metal barrel to smooth hair and give it some some lift.  Florida humidity is BRUTAL &amp; I drive a vintage (old--Ha!Ha!) convertible so I finish with a semi-strong hairspray... Aveda&#x27;s Pure Abundance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head Rush Shine has been my secret weapon for over 6 years.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well, it doesn&#x27;t give me quite the shine I want but it is very lightweight and smells great. I will continue to purchase this one because I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a similar product that didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and/or have a heavy scent that lingered in my house for hours after using it.</li>
    <li> Love!  This product gives hair a beautiful shine without the greasy feel!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product daily to &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; my hairdo for several years.  It adds a beautiful shine to my gray hair.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair shine spray. It smells so good and works great if you straighten your hair. The price is also right!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product and my hair becomes extremely shiny (in a good/healthy way) after just one use. Moreover, it smells like a hint strawberries!</li>
    <li> Not how I remember it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to add much shine or smell as wonderful as I remember. Bummer</li>
    <li> The next time I need this product, you can be sure I won&#x27;t waste gasoline and time going to pay retail.</li>
    <li> i love this product for texture and shine (great scent too) and what a great price on here compared to stores.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  The shine is wonderful and I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good product that gives a lot of shine.  Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
    <li> This product is like magic.  I&#x27;ve bought so many laminators and shine products that have gone into the garbage after one or two test runs, I had almost given up.  I&#x27;m so glad I laid down my money one more time to try out \\&quot;Head Rush\\&quot;.  I can&#x27;t even begin to describe the glow this gives my hair- it&#x27;s not oily, or sparkly, or anything like that.  It looks natural, and leaves my hair very soft.  It&#x27;s like my hair is luminescent.  I have to use this every day...</li>
    <li> I love this mist! It is super light weight and works great to give your hair that extra shine. I use it after curling my hair and my hair looks healthy. Something I need since my hair can be a little dull from all the dying it has gone through. I am forever sold with this product!!</li>
    <li> A very good product for shine and smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser used this on my hair when she flat ironed it. I could not believe how shiny and smooth my hair was, so I ordered some to use at home.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find in stores, but of course Amazon had it! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Came very fast! Makes your hair smell so good, and shiny!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite TIGI products in great price compared to hair saloons and hair product shops. It makes the hair smell lil starwberry and shines them very nice.</li>
    <li> Really great product. I LOVE how shiny this leaves my hair.</li>
    <li> Great for adding shine. Lasts a while. Does weigh down curls however. An does make hair pretty dry after long wear.</li>
    <li> GREAT hair product, really adds shine without hair looking greasy and weighed down.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!! I have thick hair that I straighten often and this stuff does the trick without weighing hair down! A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Love this.  Gives a wonderful shine and a nice texture.  I don&#x27;t use or like hairspray. This really gives your hair a nice hold.</li>
    <li> Shines pretty well. Smells amazing. Haven&#x27;t used it much but it works better than any other shine sprays I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Love this, smells good and shiny hair without greasy!!</li>
    <li> I have wavy/ curly hair that frizzes very easily.  After flat ironing my hair, I use this and everyone things I have naturally straight hair.  It really helps when it is humid or rains which is great for me bc I live in Florida.  This has been my favorite hair care product for years and Lord knows I have bought my share if products!</li>
    <li> This product (received from vendor promptly) works as advertised -- it smells great and does put a shine on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I want my hair all light an puffy, it think it could tend to weigh it down a bit . . . . but not bad!  I love it and recommend it --- I use it almost every day now.</li>
    <li> This is a very light and fine mist that you put on your hair after it has dried; I tried to put it on my hair when it was wet and didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference. When it&#x27;s dry like the directions tell you to use it though, it works. Also, it&#x27;s important not to put too much in your hair - make sure to spray as far away from your hair as possible so the mist doesn&#x27;t concentrate in one place and make your hair look greasy. The smell reminds me of strawberry candy or something. If you&#x27;re bothered by strong smells or are afraid it&#x27;ll clash with your perfume, no worries - the smell fades pretty fast after application. So, happy spraying!</li>
    <li> I have a big problem because I still dont have my product&lt;br /&gt;I bought it weeks ago, and in the tracking system it says that it was already delivered, but I didnt get it</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing !!!! It keeps the shine in and keeps the hair shiny all day long. I get so many compliments on what I so to my hair to make it so shiny...</li>
    <li> This stuff it the best!! My cousing got me hooked on it several years ago. Gives your hair a nice sleek shine</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It makes my hair soooo freaking shiny! If I apply it heavy it makes my hair kind of clump together - think beach waves and casual… love it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff when I flatiron!  Calms down the frizzy stuff, has a light, pleasant, sweet (not fruity or floral) smell and gives just a little shine.  Don&#x27;t use too much because it can make my hair a little stringy looking, but I&#x27;ve been using it for so long that I don&#x27;t make that mistake anymore.  I do still have to use a leave-in conditioner or de-frizz oil.  I have long, medium thick, wavy hair, if that helps.</li>
    <li> have used for several years. love the smell and results.  great delivery time.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  Makes your hair shine!  It&#x27;s a light fine spray.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Makes any style look more polished with the subtle shine. It also reduces fly aways but with no heavy oily quality. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have been using it for almost 10 years. It smells great and makes your hair just look a little more put together at the end. I style it first and add this as a finishing touch.</li>
    <li> My girl likes this stuff</li>
    <li> Delivers great shine to my dull old hair!  Smells terrific!</li>
    <li> im in love with the smell!!!!&lt;br /&gt;give you shine also</li>
    <li> Great product and great price. The cap broke during shipping...as it wasn&#x27;t packaged very well...but the nozzle works....and it is a great price for Bed Head.</li>
    <li> You have to shake it like crazy to get anything to come out and it really doesn&#x27;t have much effect. I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> All I know is don&#x27;t buy from THESMARTLOOK, first the bottles had dry glue on the outside, I decided to overlook because they worked, so what the heck; well they stopped working after a week, didn&#x27;t spray at all; horrible damaged products</li>
    <li> I purchased this stuff because of all the good reviews and I tend to like TIGI products but this actually made my hair frizzy :/  I tried using a smaller amount but I still got the same result. I used it while my hair was straight and after I curled.. Same result. My hair isn&#x27;t usually frizzy and I had high hopes for this product so a little dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I have naturally frizzy/wavy hair so I flat iron my hair almost daily to make it look straight and soft.  I wanted something to put on my hair as soon as I finished flat ironing it, but nothing that was too heavy because it would then make my hair look greasy.  This shine mist was the product I was looking for!! It&#x27;s a light mist that adds just the right amount of shine to my hair, but without that oily look.  I really hate feeling hair products in my hair; I want to use products that help my hair without it feeling like gobs of sticky stuff is clumped in my hair. I can&#x27;t feel this mist in my hair at all, but I know it&#x27;s there because it makes my hair soft &amp; shiny...love it. Oh, and it smells amazing! I will keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> when my hair looks dull and dry, Rush makes it shiny without added weight.</li>
    <li> Love Bed Head products! This shine spray is light and leaves your hair super shiny!! One of my favorite products!</li>
    <li> Great! this really works! Finally a great product for hair that really works and I can count on. Thanks !!Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Best shine product I&#x27;ve ever used. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy and adds a really nice shine to my hair!</li>
    <li> I have frizzy, thick brown hair that decided to give up halfway between &#x27;straight&#x27; and &#x27;wavy&#x27; and naturally settles into a disheveled, rumpled mess unless I provide heavy intervention. I managed to learn how to tame its frizz and shape, but no matter what conditioners I use or how I flat iron or curl it, it still looks very dull and matte in texture. This shine spray is the first product I&#x27;ve found that actually helps it look soft and glossy instead of making it look like I haven&#x27;t showered for two weeks. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it noticeably more greasy, either. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Make my hair pretty and shine</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair &amp; also gives the hair a nice shine. ..reasonably priced  I will buy it again</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time and love it. I bought a couple for stocking stuffers and it went over well!</li>
    <li> Usually love Bed Head products....but I am not a fan of this at all. I sprayed it on my hair from a reasonable distance but instead of making it \\&quot;shine\\&quot; the spray made my hair feel greasy. Will not purchase this again. The shine spray from Paul Mitchell works better and smells way better.</li>
    <li> The smell is fan tas tic! The shine is incredible. I will be telling every one about this great purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes your hair shiny &amp; soft.  The smell is wonderful!  Just don&#x27;t spray too much or you will have a wetter look.</li>
    <li> I spray a small amount on my dry hair before using the flat iron.  It really gives hair an instant shine and silky feeling.  My hair frizzes and waves in humid weather, but this product does quite a good job of keeping it smooth.</li>
    <li> Hands down this is one of my favorite hair care products. I have been using it for 5 years at least &amp; use it daily. I even have a baby bottle for traveling. It works great for my hair type (a lot of hair, but strands very fine), but I also have recommended it to friends with different hair textures (e.g., thick, curly) &amp; it has worked great for them as well. This product gives great shine without weighing your hair down at all. The best part is that you never have to worry about using too much product. If you apply to much you can turn your blow dryer on and do a quick run over your hair and the excess product is gone. When overused many other shine products can make your hair look oily/greasy &amp; weigh your hair down, ultimately requiring you to re-wash and re-style your hair if you use too much. .</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair and I loved it!  Buying it on line is easy and saves money since I buy more than one.</li>
    <li> I used this several times but I find it no better than other products to impart shine.such as Morrocan oil spray.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for an aerosol shine spray for a while, and I have no idea what took me so long to find this. Answer to my prayers! I had an expensive aerosol shine spray before, but I wanted something cheaper. This spray may be even better than the salon one I had! It smells so freaking good, and adds instant shine to my blonde hair. Love it :)</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of this to make your hair shine. I&#x27;ve found that if you spray it close to your roots, then the top of your head looks greasy, but if you just keep it on the body of your hair, you have a beautiful, silky shine!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!!! Makes my hair shiny without being greasy. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on me and I love the way it make my hair shine.  I had to order some for myself.  It is much cheaper online than at the salon!</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these. They came banged up, and 1 of them is missing the sprayer so I can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
    <li> Just tried this product. The smell is wonderful</li>
    <li> This product adds a very nice finish to blow dried hair! Nice smell, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. Great price too!</li>
