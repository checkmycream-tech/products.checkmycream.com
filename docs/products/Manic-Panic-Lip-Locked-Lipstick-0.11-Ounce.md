      <li>It&#x27;s quite purple in color, without being so PURPLE that you look as though you&#x27;ve swiped a magic marker across your lips.  </li>
      <li>The cute design is a miscellaneous plus.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS AS U CAN TELL.</li>
      <li>and i love the design of the case also .you</li>
      <li>(I prefer plum and this is more violet)</li>
      <li>This lipstick was a lot better</li>
      <li>I have fair skin with yellow/golden undertones, and this lipstick just did not look right on me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>lipstick feels luscious, is perfectly royal purple, wears long, and doesnt chap lips.  </li>
      <li>I had been searching for a long time for the perfect purple lipstick to match my skin tone....</li>
      <li>This lipstick is very true to color and is long-lasting.</li>
      <li>It is a true purple rather than the reddish purple that most lipsticks claim to say are purple.</li>
      <li>The color and shade are perfect... and it really compliment my dark skin... love it!</li>
      <li>I feel very confident wearing it, and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments from many different kinds of people.</li>
      <li>The color is a rich beautiful purple that stays put for several hours without a touch-up.</li>
      <li>the color is and it applies smoothly and it isn&#x27;t oily</li>
      <li>The color goes on smooth and remaines Purple.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of shimmery or sparkly things, but my boyfriend thinks this lipstick looks great on me, so I&#x27;ll keep it.  </li>
      <li>(LOL) TRUE DEEP PURPLE.</li>
      <li>its actually a very eep strong purple more suited for haloween...</li>
      <li>It goes on very smoothly and lasts very long on its own.</li>
      <li>the case is even cool.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy with this lipstick I didn&#x27;t need to reapply as often as with other lipstick</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for when I don&#x27;t want my makeup to be too outlandish, but I want a subtle uniqueness.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bold color though so you&#x27;ll need to work it with some confidence.</li>
      <li>I would like the texture of this lipcolor product to be more slippery and moisturizing and creamily opaque, but the color is the main thing.  </li>
      <li>Look--Neutral eyes and Bold lips-Matte</li>
      <li>Bold eyes and Bold shinny lips</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth the time.</li>
      <li>This went on very smoothly and kept a nice vivid color for a long time.</li>
      <li>and I wa snt willing to spend a lot of money on it when i rarely wear lip stick.</li>
      <li>On second thought, will purchase two more tubes and refrigerate just in case.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a different color than most wear</li>
      <li>but it comes out looking exactly like the picture.</li>
      <li>and when I did, it looks exactly like I wanted it to look.</li>
      <li>This was my first Manic Panic lipstick</li>
      <li>I would say this is a good buy if you want to sample a dark purple lipstick and don&#x27;t want to spend too much money on something you might not look good in (then again, you could just buy a Wet &amp; Wild lipstick...</li>
      <li>super love its so dark</li>
      <li>Normally when I purchase really interesting colored lipsticks they have sub par texture, little staying power, and are blatantly more for costuming then decent wear.</li>
      <li>I really wanted a purple lipstick.</li>
      <li>and I found it to be very drying.</li>
      <li>this is a deep rich purple..</li>
      <li>Bought for a Mardi Gras party and I am getting compliments left and right!</li>
      <li>I was a little worry that the color might not be bright enough...</li>
      <li>I love this Deadly Purple Lipstick.  </li>
      <li>price is attractive, but the coverage on this lipstick is pretty bad.</li>
      <li>The lipstick is very creamy and moisturizing and it REALLY LAST.</li>
      <li>I wear it frequently with an urban decay lip primer and it lasts all day.</li>

<li> As a dark skinned Black woman who wears ONLY purple, I have a hard time finding purple lipsticks which do not look garish and costumey while at the same time providing true purple pigment which does not turn pinkish.  </li>
<li> However, it&#x27;s not really practical to wear on a daily basis and</li>
<li> Really pops out with a little black lipliner.</li>
<li> When I found other brands they tended to be not only pinkish but also drying.  </li>
<li> They&#x27;ve browned the purple down just ever so slightly, making the lipcolor look a bit toward natural, while still being assertive and usable for, \\&quot;In your face...</li>
<li> Went on matte, but I added a little gloss to give it my extra punch.</li>
<li> Now....don&#x27;t be confused, this lipstick is PURPLE, but it is a VERY wearable  purple.</li>
<li> This purple doesn&#x27;t compare to any other purple I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> I am so looking forward to trying other lipsticks from this brand.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s sheer and streaky, which is too bad because it really is a pretty color.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not as dark as I would like it</li>
<li> It is not so dark</li>
<li> it looks black or brown, not is it glow in the dark glittery like halloween makeup.  </li>
<li> Sometimes I wear a little lip gloss over it.  </li>
<li> I have tried it in the house a few times but have not worn it out yet.</li>
<li> I bought this because it is hard to find purple in the pharmacy</li>
<li> for some reason i thought this was a subtle purple color.</li>
<li> cant go wrong with this</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a purple lover and when I find this lip color I went crazy.  </li>

    <li> I was a little worry that the color might not be bright enough...turn out I was worrying for nothing. The color and shade are perfect... and it really compliment my dark skin... love it!</li>
    <li> As a dark skinned Black woman who wears ONLY purple, I have a hard time finding purple lipsticks which do not look garish and costumey while at the same time providing true purple pigment which does not turn pinkish.  When I found other brands they tended to be not only pinkish but also drying.  To get the best almost perfect shade took mixing two colors with a gloss.  Whew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lipstick feels luscious, is perfectly royal purple, wears long, and doesnt chap lips.  It is not so dark it looks black or brown, not is it glow in the dark glittery like halloween makeup.  Bought one tube one day, it arrived the next day, ordered another tube that day.  One in purse, one on vanity.  Hopefully this will last me through the summer.  On second thought, will purchase two more tubes and refrigerate just in case.</li>
    <li> I like this lipstick a lot. The color is nice, and it glides on well. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is awesome!  It was just what I was looking for to finish off my costume.  Its a great shade of purple and the case is even cool.  So excited!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS AS U CAN TELL. (LOL) TRUE DEEP PURPLE. I CAN&#x27;T GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT SOMEONE ASKING ME THE NAME.. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as dark as I would like it (I prefer plum and this is more violet) but it comes out looking exactly like the picture. I wear it frequently with an urban decay lip primer and it lasts all day. I think this would look good on anyone regardless of skin color. It&#x27;s a bold color though so you&#x27;ll need to work it with some confidence. Will definitely buy again and try out different colors as well.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is amazing I have a darker skin tone and it looks great the color is and it applies smoothly and it isn&#x27;t oily</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m screaming---BEAUTIFUL COLOR. I love this Deadly Purple Lipstick.  I&#x27;m a purple lover and when I find this lip color I went crazy.  The color goes on smooth and remaines Purple. Went on matte, but I added a little gloss to give it my extra punch. This will look great on any skin tone.  Women of Color--GET It.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Look--Neutral eyes and Bold lips-Matte&lt;br /&gt;The Look--Bold eyes and Bold shinny lips</li>
    <li> I wear this all the time, have to fight the daughters for it too. Got the item on time too.</li>
    <li> Like the case and the shade, I would recommend this but I do not know if this is for everyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a different color than most wear but it isn&#x27;t too out there. It takes a couple coats to get it to the correct color but it&#x27;s worth the time. It is a true purple rather than the reddish purple that most lipsticks claim to say are purple. I would definitely repurchase this should I run out. It&#x27;s perfect for when I don&#x27;t want my makeup to be too outlandish, but I want a subtle uniqueness. Love this color!</li>
    <li> This purple doesn&#x27;t compare to any other purple I&#x27;ve tried. Great with any outfit, love this color against my complexion!!</li>
    <li> Love this! Bought for a Mardi Gras party and I am getting compliments left and right! Absolutely love Manic Panic!</li>

They&#x27;ve browned the purple down just ever so slightly, making the lipcolor look a bit toward natural, while still being assertive and usable for, \\&quot;In your face... Yeah, my lips are purple--what&#x27;s it to you?!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I was so happy with this lipstick I didn&#x27;t need to reapply as often as with other lipstick and it didn&#x27;t smear</li>
    <li> I bought this because it is hard to find purple in the pharmacy and I wa snt willing to spend a lot of money on it when i rarely wear lip stick.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a long time for the perfect purple lipstick to match my skin tone....I have finally found it!  The color is a rich beautiful purple that stays put for several hours without a touch-up. Sometimes I wear a little lip gloss over it.  Manic Panic makes the best PURPLE lipstick on the market!</li>
    <li> this is a deep rich purple..super love its so dark and i love the design of the case also .you cant go wrong with this</li>
    <li> I bought this shade on a different account almost a year ago. Trust anybody when they say that this is the perfect purple. I feel very confident wearing it, and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments from many different kinds of people. It goes on very smoothly and lasts very long on its own. The cute design is a miscellaneous plus.</li>
    <li> This lipstick was a lot better then I thought it would be. This was my first Manic Panic lipstick and I was impressed by the quality. Normally when I purchase really interesting colored lipsticks they have sub par texture, little staying power, and are blatantly more for costuming then decent wear. This went on very smoothly and kept a nice vivid color for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the best color ever. The lipstick goes on smooth and looks great. Really pops out with a little black lipliner. Requires reapplying but you&#x27;ll look great!</li>
    <li> I like the color, but I didn&#x27;t realize it had a shimmer to it until I put it on.  I had thought it was a solid purple when I bought it, and I didn&#x27;t see anything in the product description to say otherwise.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of shimmery or sparkly things, but my boyfriend thinks this lipstick looks great on me, so I&#x27;ll keep it.  I also wish it lasted longer, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on through eating or drinking or kissing.</li>
    <li> I really wanted a purple lipstick. This brand purple has great pigment. I have tried it in the house a few times but have not worn it out yet. I am sure it will look great with the right outfit.</li>
    <li> for some reason i thought this was a subtle purple color. its actually a very eep strong purple more suited for haloween...</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I went ahead and ordered this lipstick! I could not wait to try it on and when I did, it looks exactly like I wanted it to look. Now....don&#x27;t be confused, this lipstick is PURPLE, but it is a VERY wearable  purple. It looks great against my NW45 skin too. I am so looking forward to trying other lipsticks from this brand. The lipstick is very creamy and moisturizing and it REALLY LAST. I ate, kissed my man, and drank  and it was STILL there! Now...I just need a BLUSH TO MATCH!! CAN ANYONE  HELP ME WITH THAT??</li>
    <li> This lipstick is very true to color and is long-lasting. However, it&#x27;s not really practical to wear on a daily basis and and I found it to be very drying.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin with yellow/golden undertones, and this lipstick just did not look right on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is attractive, but the coverage on this lipstick is pretty bad. It&#x27;s sheer and streaky, which is too bad because it really is a pretty color.
