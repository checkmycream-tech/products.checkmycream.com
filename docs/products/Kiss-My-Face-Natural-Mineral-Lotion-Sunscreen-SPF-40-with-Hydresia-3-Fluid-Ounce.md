      <li>My Face has the best soap but forget about the sunscreens</li>
      <li>This is the best Kiss</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>This is an excellent sunscreen.</li>
      <li>best sunscreen ever for the face!  </li>
      <li>Best I have found....</li>
      <li>Yes, there is some rubbing involved to avoid the vampire look, but once applied it&#x27;s the best ever.</li>
      <li>This is the best I have used.</li>
      <li>Very happy with the product.</li>
      <li>what worked best for us?</li>
      <li>the perfect</li>
      <li>I am very fair and have not burned using this on my face.</li>
      <li>Or maybe, because I&#x27;m so fair, I just didn&#x27;t notice it after a while!</li>
      <li>It is  natural/mineral with a list of great ingredients.</li>
      <li>This is a great sunscreen.</li>
      <li>It seems to have great staying power.</li>
      <li>That would have been a deal-breaker, so we were so happy to discover that the sunblock wasn&#x27;t greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works great for me!I</li>
      <li>This worked great for my toddler.</li>
      <li>Great Hope my allergies don&#x27;t kick in</li>
      <li>I thought this product was great do to the reviews.</li>
      <li>It is great under makeup though</li>
      <li>As for performance, since it spreads great I haven&#x27;t missed spots and neither of us have any burns.  </li>
      <li>It worked great, because I followed the directions, and re-applied it when i was supposed to do so.  </li>
      <li>Petroleum and lanolin are even welcome, in my book.&lt;br /&gt;But&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
      <li>A great product, I recommend this purchase.</li>
      <li>and it feels great on our skin.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>I wish it worked, because it smells and applies very nicely.</li>
      <li>In fact, once it dries it leaves virtually no sheen at all, which is very nice.</li>
      <li>Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, which Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, then for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best.</li>
      <li>This is a fair price with great SPF.  </li>

      <li>good product…..</li>
      <li>But good EWG ratings and a clippable coupon got me to try it.  </li>
      <li>but it is good to know that there are fewer chemicals in the sunscreen.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Check out the 2013 reports and you will find out that this did not offer protection in compare to the Target brand regardless of all their claims and all their good ingredients...</li>
      <li>We are quite fair skinned and find this sunscreen to work well.</li>
      <li>This is a really good sunblock.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not that good as a mosturizer, however.</li>
      <li>but it is good to know that there are fewer chemicals in the sunscreen.</li>

      <li>Great sunscreen without all the toxic chemicals found in most sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the price &amp; the seller.</li>
      <li>but I hope they enjoyed it!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I love the texture and works amazing!</li>
      <li>Our favorite sunscreen-a must for beach trips!</li>
      <li>I looked this up via an ingredient list since most sunscreen have cancer causing ingredients!</li>
      <li>This seems to help GREATLY in getting a smooth, even application.  </li>
      <li>, it would have been nice to try.  </li>
      <li>We were very impressed with how it rubbed in VERY well on everyone.</li>
      <li>(makes your skin kind of whiter)</li>
      <li>No product is perfect for everyone, but this one gets really close for me.</li>
      <li>I could never get the Goddess Garden sunscreen to rub in nicely on my kids</li>
      <li>I bought this sunscreen at the whole foods store and Loved it!!....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest...</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s effective.</li>
      <li>the ingredients are very safe and kept my fair toddler burn free all summer</li>
      <li>Great product from a quick seller.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying a bunch of all natural, non-aerosol sunscreens this summer, and I like this one best.</li>
      <li>I bought this because EWG recommends it as an effective and safe sunscreen.</li>
      <li>i love this and it blends in nicely</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also used Loving Naturals sunscreen and it works a lot better.  </li>
      <li>Out of all the natural sunscreens I have tried I like this one the best.</li>
      <li>Cool Sport 50 Spray was a nice addition this year, smells good and worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think it is the best of the bunch so far and will be buying more.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably try something different when I&#x27;ve used it up, just because it doesn&#x27;t look so good on my face, especially in bright light.</li>
      <li>I wore this to a fair where I was out in full sun for 4-5 hours</li>
      <li>It has a good safety rating on Environmental Working Group website, and it has a mild scent if any.</li>
      <li>Had to buy more on Amazon because I can&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
      <li>My husband and I use this and love that it is 40</li>
      <li>I feel like it goes on smoother than most.</li>
      <li>I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t contain all the chemicals</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the sunscreens on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s safe sunscreen list and this is one of my favorites.  </li>
      <li>It is touted as being \\&quot;food grade,\\&quot; that is, you could safely eat it, because it is derived from vegetable oil.</li>
      <li>I think this product is one of the better ones.</li>
      <li>: Many cosmetic companies are also substituting this preservative for carcinogenic parabens.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> is to put it on after your regular cream or lotion so it goes on smoother. That way it doesn&#x27;t leave that white residue that others have mentioned.</li>
    <li> Strange consistency -- very watery. Will be returning.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write Amazon reviews, but I have to say that I&#x27;m SO pleased with this product.  My face is normally combination and I have found my t-zone to be far less oily when using this sunscreen.  It evens out tone (makes your skin kind of whiter) BUT it makes for a nice makeup primer prior to application.  Plus, its EWG approved, whoop!</li>
    <li> This zinc-based sunscreen gets a good EWG rating--but as many others have said, it&#x27;s very thick and hard to rub in.  Also, while it may be less allergenic, I really missed having a scent!  ThinkBaby has been a much better choice for us.  It rubs in better with no white film on your skin, and smells nice.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen. I normally don&#x27;t like the way sunscreen feels on my skin. It is sticky and generally just icky. This is the best I have used.</li>
    <li> but be prepared....it&#x27;s like putting white zinc oxide on.  it is thick and works extremely well as a sunscreen.  recommended to me as one of the all natural sunscreens.  love it.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before choosing this sunscreen. It has the best ingredients and works extremely well. I&#x27;ve never been burned while wearing it. It smells nice and goes on smoothly, but it takes a little work to rub in the white.</li>
    <li> Smooth and protecting</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen at the whole foods store and Loved it!!.... Had to buy more on Amazon because I can&#x27;t find it anymore. I&#x27;m a runner and cyclist..(mid 40&#x27;s) so taking care of my skin is No Joke!.... This stuff works!!... No redness....no scent... Not sticky... It is a thick white cream so it can leave white areas if you don&#x27;t smooth on evenly. I use on face neck arms and hands!</li>
    <li> I made a mistake and ordered this based on packaging, not paying close attention to the description; I didn&#x27;t realize it was the mineral lotion form. I decided to give it a shot anyway, but didn&#x27;t care for the smell, the feel (a little bit of stinging on my sensitive skin), and it definitely wasn&#x27;t easily rubbing in clear! I can&#x27;t return it, so I&#x27;ll see if it works for a friend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love this product. The product seemed half empty upon arrival and there was no safety seal. Also, it goes on very dry and hard to spread on the skin.</li>
    <li> In the beginning i did not like it. It is watery, and very white when first put on skin. I have to rub its hard but after a few minutes, it seems to settle and looks quite natural. The skin feels smooth and not greasy or oily. I have another sunscreen/lotion which really feels greasy at touch. Updated after a few weeks, it becomes liquid like and hard to use. So I downgrade the rating from 5 to 3</li>
    <li> I have used this product many times and love it.It works great for me!I will buy it again as long as they sell</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product.  The lotion is thick so you need to use a ton of it to cover yourself.  It is very hard to spread evenly.  Even when spread evenly and thinly it makes your skin pasty white.  The lotion then dries into a flaky crust that gets stuck deep inside your pores.  It then becomes hard to wash away even with liberal use of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used Loving Naturals sunscreen and it works a lot better.  It goes on easily, dries clear and is easy to clean.  I don&#x27;t know where Loving Naturals stands in the hierarchy of natural sunscreen brands, but it&#x27;s a much better product than Kiss My Face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest... I use mineral sunscreen because I have a skin sensitivity to most synthetics. That&#x27;s all. I don&#x27;t really give a crap about phthalates or parabens or gluten. Petroleum and lanolin are even welcome, in my book.&lt;br /&gt;But&lt;br /&gt;BUT&lt;br /&gt;OMG this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are not kidding about it blending in clear. It goes on with a nice, light moisturizing feel that dries fast, with no sticky or oily residue. At all. &amp;lt;i&gt;In a mineral sunscreen.&amp;lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside: This stuff separates. I recommend storing it standing up, cap down, and giving it a couple good firm shakes before using each time.</li>
    <li> I wish it worked, because it smells and applies very nicely. We spent 3 hours at the beach and reapplied this sunscreen 3 times, but our faces and necks were burned in the evening. Usually that&#x27;s more than enough when we use Seventh generation baby sunscreen or California Baby one. Going back to those again.&lt;br /&gt;I will try to  use this one in spring, we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Good coverage, lightweight, not as white as most mineral sunscreens tend to be. Pleasant scent and decent price. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and am also currently using Obagi Nu-derm an expensive but wonderful line of skin care.  It contains Retin A (tretinoin) and so using a sunscreenn every day is a must.  I actually like this product better than the $50 Obagi sunscreen they recommend.  This is so moisturizing and I find after about 5 minutes it settles in and I am able to apply my BB cream over it beautifully.  Obagi can be very drying to the skin in the first phase and this sunscreen saved me.  My derm says physical block sunscreens are the way to go in preventing age spots and sun damage.  I am sold on this one!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband based on Environmental Working Groups&#x27;s (EWG) good scores for effectiveness and being low on the harmful scale. However, once applied it did not absorb well, but seemed to mostly stay white on top of his skin. I returned it, and would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I try to stick to natural mineral sunscreens and as some of you might already know they can leave you a little bit white.  As everything is relative, I can only compare this to Badger and Goddess Garden sunscreens.  Badger was always too thick for me and I had to rub hard to get it rubbed in and it felt too heavy on the skin.  Goddess Garden (adult/kids/baby/and face)- I like it on areas that you can do long quick strokes to rub it in.  It feels very nice on the skin, but I always got white little chunky bits on my face and neck.  I could never get the Goddess Garden sunscreen to rub in nicely on my kids faces.&lt;br /&gt;I love the Kiss my Face mineral sunscreen.  It rubs in \\&quot;relatively\\&quot; clear - slightly white and it doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy.  The main plus is when I sweated a lot while mowing the lawn it did not turn back to white, like some sunscreen can (I can not say how effective it was after sweating).  This is the only mineral sunscreen I feel I can rub into my kids faces.  The big con of this sunscreen is the price - it is almost twice the price of Goddess Garden.  A family of 4 could go through a whole tube in a day.  Because of this I plan on using this product for faces and stick with the Goddess Garden for bodies.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Its affordable, non greasy and pleasant scented natural mineral sunscreen that moisturizes. One of the few makeup goes on smoothly without feeling oily and like I have a thick mask on. Also doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Absorbs quickly so hasn&#x27;t stained any of my tops since I also apply it to my neck and chest daily as well.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was great do to the reviews. However, it leaves my face really really white, much more than all the tens of sunscreen I have used in the past. Additionally, when it comes out of the bottle it has lots of little lumps, which means that the liquid solidifies and it is annoying. I suggest buying Anthelios which is the sunscreen I had before buying this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of \\&quot;safe\\&quot; sunscreens from EWG&#x27;s list.  I think this product is one of the better ones. Yes, it does not completely soak in and leaves a bit of a white tint on your skin, but that&#x27;s the point.  Overall, for this type of sunscreen, it is not greasy and spreads well.  I also like California Baby, but it&#x27;s considerably more expensive.  I would stay away from Badger brand, it&#x27;s super greasy.</li>
    <li> This product works just fine, but its not easily applied... you really have to pay attention to how you apply this sunscreen. It&#x27;s got a weird dry feel to it and it tends to make the area look more pale than it would be naturally. It also comes on streaky ... I&#x27;ve had a couple friends end up with white marks on their faces even. I really like that its all-natural but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d personally purchase this product again. Will finish the bottle though, so 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Has a bit of a chalky finish.  This doesn&#x27;t bother me since it barely shows on my daughter&#x27;s fair skin. I can only compAre it to California Baby sensitive but the Kiss My Face brand is much easier to apply.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m rubbing my child&#x27;s skin off to spread it around!</li>
    <li> I was looking through Environmental Working Group site in search of a safer sunscreen and this one was listed as 1. I hope their ratings mean something. Anyway, I bought it and although it does dry clear on my body, it still leaves white tint on my face. It is less than some others but the stuff gets in my pores and I end up having tiny white spots all around my face and especially near the hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has good consistency, not wax-like but not too liquid, spreads easily and feels much less oily than other sunscreens that I have used before. In fact, once it dries it leaves virtually no sheen at all, which is very nice. It has almost no smell. I&#x27;ll use it for my body but will have to think of something else for my face. A hat perhaps.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this is a mineral based sunscreen. HOWEVER, it does not rub in clear as advertised. People have noticed white residue on my face every day that I have worn it so far.</li>
    <li> This is a fair price with great SPF.  I bought it because of its natural rating.  It does leave little white lumps on the skin upon initial application.  I have to remove the lumps as they do not absorb into my skin.</li>
    <li> I recommend the squeeze bottle over the spray as the spray pump broke. A great product, I recommend this purchase.</li>
    <li> made me break out, didn&#x27;t like it. I am now using Kimberly Sayver moisturizer with spf 30 and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> its white and MESSY....but...it works...I&#x27;m VERY pale and I was out in the sun for 9 hrs and didnt burn with this on!!!&lt;br /&gt;Shake it well, keep it OUT of the sun, and rub it in well (or you&#x27;ll be a ghosty on the beach!!)</li>
    <li> Environmental Working Group (EWG) recommended this brand.  It&#x27;s a little to runny, but I&#x27;m trying it.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic sunscreen.  It has titanium dioxide and zinc oxide which are great natural sunblocks and it is water resistant.  It goes on thick but can be rubbed in and has always provided me and my family great protection, especially on much needed days, for example a long day on the beach!  I do reapply after a few hours playing in the water.  Unfortunately, it is not sold on the kiss my face website any more.  It is very difficult to find a water resistant sunscreen with the zinc oxide and titanium dioxide that provide such excellent blockage.  Maybe the reason is because of cost.  Please if you are like me and a big fan of this combination - let kiss my face know your preferences!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the best Kiss My Face Sunscreen since it has the highest zinc 12% but it comes with titanium 6% which is a carcinogen. Kiss My Face has the best soap but forget about the sunscreens, that is a whole world by itself. This is still better than most brands out in the market only if titanium is not an issue to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the 2013 reports and you will find out that this did not offer protection in compare to the Target brand regardless of all their claims and all their good ingredients... I use many brands and I will not use Target&#x27;s formula but there are many other brands out there with good ingredients and great protection. Target, Hawaiian Tropic, Copper tone, etc. may offer protection but offer many unwanted chemicals as well. Bottom line, what ingredients are you looking for and how well it protects you for what you pay per ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens. Producers write whatever they want and it really consumes time to read up and compare facts. Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, which Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, then for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best. What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by my skin. I don&#x27;t intend to have the sunscreen for snack but it is good to know that there are fewer chemicals in the sunscreen. Usually those SPFs will not be over 30 for any safe sunscreen ingredients and it will be for BABYs. I just happen to be a baby who tries to read ingredients. I wear a rash guard when surfing which covers my upper body so I am protected all the time. What worries me is my face. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in order to protect my skin and control the needed ingredient which is zinc oxide, I make my own sunscreen since I double the amount of zinc where I apply it on my nose and more importantly costs me less with only few USDA organic ingredients as well.er a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens.

Vanicream 30 and 35 have less zinc so those are worthless, unless if you want to go by what Consumer Report recommends which rates protection without any consideration for ingredients in the sunscreen then in that case, I can get roofing tar for less money, so we might as well consider that... Zinc is the solution, more zinc for less money with organic ingredients that are not carcinogen or harmful to me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in order to protect my skin and control the needed ingredient which is zinc oxide, I make my own sunscreen since I double the amount of zinc where I apply it on my nose and more importantly costs me less with only few USDA organic ingredients as well.</li>
    <li> At first I was very impressed with the list of natural ingredients and the claim of blending into your skin evenly. It definitely does NOT rub in to your skin. It leaves a very heavy, silvery-white coating on my skin.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re still looking for a replacement for the now discontinued Neutrogena SPF 30 zinc/titanium oxide sunblock we had been using. This stuff does block the sun, but it&#x27;s a bit thicker than we&#x27;d like, and, worse, it has an oily smell. Someone should come up with a sunblock matrix - SPF versus carbowax number. Carbowaxes are organic compounds used to control how thick a product is. Then we could just say SPF 30 and Carbowax 42 or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, you can do worse than try this, but if you want something a bit more liquid and with less odor, keep searching. We sure are.</li>
    <li> We all wore this at first on our trip to Mexico, kids and adults with same coverage and time in the water, but kids quickly burned the first afternoon.  We realized the big problem is that we can put it on our face and ignore it, but the kids are always rubbing their face, especially when water splashes, and so this healthier topical barrier-style sunscreen is ineffective for them and thank goodness we brought along the toxic chemical (banana boat) sunscreen too which then worked fine for them the rest of the vacation.&lt;br /&gt;I did continue to use kiss my face and it was just fine for me.  I didn&#x27;t think I was much whiter, and it was easy to apply and spread.</li>
    <li> good product…..decent price….and does the job….full of zinc oxide that may turn your face a little pale after application…but no additives that are unhealthy like other sunscreens</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen it&#x27;s great! It is working very well, not oily or smelly. If your looking for a natural sunscreen look no further!</li>
    <li> DOES NOT BLEND CLEAR.&lt;br /&gt;I am tan and I tell you every time I wore this people could tell bc they would see a splotch. I wanted this bc it was ewg ok but if you are tan... man i was trying to blend this for 5minutes or more any given time. I won&#x27;t buy again despite the ingredients and subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Goes on very &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; but absorbs quickly and then skin is smooth. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I like to use physical barrier sunscreens, but most are really thick and white. This does rub in much better than most.</li>
    <li> Great Hope my allergies don&#x27;t kick in</li>
    <li> We have some family members here with sensitive skin that itches and rashes easily.  This product doesn&#x27;t bother anyone&#x27;s skin here, and it seems to do its job of protecting us from too much sun when we are enjoying our summer days outside.  I was slightly worried about it not blending in well or feeling either greasy or cakey on our skins, but it blends excellently and leaves no feeling of residue whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This is a really good sunblock. I ordered it because when I looked it up in the EWG website it was rated very low in toxicity (a 2 I think) and has no parabens and no chemical sunscreens. I am a VERY fair person (strawberry blonde, blue eyes, and freckles) and at mid day on a sunny summer day I can get a light sunburn in about 20-30 minutes if I&#x27;m not wearing any sunblock. I wore this to a fair where I was out in full sun for 4-5 hours and I had just the barest hint of color the next day. It works well! It does leave a white tint, but I found that that faded away as the lotion &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; into my skin. Or maybe, because I&#x27;m so fair, I just didn&#x27;t notice it after a while! It also is not as greasy as other sunblocks I&#x27;ve tried. It has a dry feel to it. It rubbed in pretty easily. Compared to other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunblocks I have tried it is about half the price. The thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars (and what has me continuing to look for something better) is the smell. It&#x27;s not too strong, but it does have a weird smell. To me it smells a little like plastic off gassing. My husband also noticed it. So even though the SPF works well, it rubs in well, is low toxicity, and doesn&#x27;t cost as much as other brands... I am going to use up this tube and keep looking for something I like better.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s one of the \\&quot;safe-ish\\&quot; sunblocks as rated by the Environmental Working Group. It&#x27;s also reasonably priced and actually spreads on pretty smoothly, unlike a lot of mineral sunscreens that just kind of sit there. It seems fairly effective; I use it on my daughter and myself, and though we do get some sun (we live in Florida so it&#x27;s an unavoidable fact of life) we have not gotten sunburnt.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this sunblock on a couple of recent trips to the beach for everyone in our family--us parents and our young&#x27;un--and we&#x27;ve been very satisfied, with a few caveats explained below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, by way of background, my wife doesn&#x27;t use gluten-containing products on her skin; she acknowledges the controversy in the gluten-free community as to whether this even matters, but her switch to gluten-free (or perhaps just to natural products in general?) has made her skin much clearer and smoother. She swears that she breaks out after just one application of a regular sunblock. She also has oily skin, so there could be a double-whammy effect going on here. Because she&#x27;s using gluten-free products for herself, that means the whole family&#x27;s doing the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I love the Mineral Fusion powder sunblock, but we knew that wasn&#x27;t going to be enough for our young&#x27;un at the beach (and we were right: he still got a healthy glow even after using the Kiss My Face sunblock). So we purchased this sunblock, and it worked out well for everyone:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) We were very impressed with how it rubbed in VERY well on everyone. Our son did NOT like having us put sunblock on him, but we didn&#x27;t even have to go over the same spots again: the sunblock was already rubbed in his skin after one quick swipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) We did not experience any weird white tint, except for on my beard stubble from not shaving that morning. We were surprised by this after all of the reviews mentioning this, plus the fact that we didn&#x27;t have to rub in the sunblock very much at all. We are all fair-to-medium skinned, so I&#x27;m not sure if this makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) The sunblock stayed on and did its job. We were in the water and on the sand and out in the sun for several hours (not the entire day, but several hours). We all got a small glow from the sun but, happily, no burns whatsoever, and this was after spending two minutes (max) applying the sunblock to three people total, including a squirmy toddler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) The sunblock is NOT greasy at all. That would have been a deal-breaker, so we were so happy to discover that the sunblock wasn&#x27;t greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(5) The sunblock has little to no scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the whole experience of putting this sunblock on and having it on was surprisingly painless for all three of us. As I alluded to earlier, my wife and I prefer the mineral powder, in part because we don&#x27;t like having to deal with the mess of getting sunscreen on our hands, so we were pleasantly surprised by the lack of the \\&quot;ick\\&quot; factor with this sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product four stars because we were in a rush when we purchased this sunblock, so we&#x27;re still open to finding \\&quot;the\\&quot; sunblock, which may be this product, and it may not be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why might this product not be \\&quot;the\\&quot; sunblock for us? Our only two concerns are (1) the price and (2) the titanium dioxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the price, I realize that price is always going to be a factor when you&#x27;re buying premium natural products like this, but I have read that there are other natural sunblocks out there that aren&#x27;t as costly. Also, I know that my wife had good experiences with Alba Botanica (less expensive and gluten-free) before we had a kid, so that&#x27;s a product we&#x27;re going to look into again now that we have a kid, along with other comparable products. The Kiss My Face was a small tube that we received that would not have lasted a couple of days; that&#x27;s why we had to buy two of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the titanium dioxide, some say it doesn&#x27;t matter; others say it does. Some other reviewers have named some other natural sunblocks that don&#x27;t contain titanium dioxide, so we&#x27;d like to try those out to see if they perform as well as this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a bunch of all natural, non-aerosol sunscreens this summer, and I like this one best. It is easy to apply, which is huge in my book (some of the others I tried are so thick, my daughter would cry when I tried to spread it on her skin). So it goes on smooth and works just as well as any other sunscreen. I burn very easily, but haven&#x27;t burned at all during my last two all-day beach trips, and this is all I used.</li>
    <li> Really, really heavy and makes me look like I have a white mask.</li>
    <li> This product did protect my skin from the sun however, I do not like the smell and it is extremely difficult to blend into my skin and wash off.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice smell, spreads on easily, dissolves into the skin as much as is possible for a product made with titanium dioxide and zinc oxide (more on that below), and it works well to prevent sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two main types of sunscreens, physical and chemical. Chemical sunscreens are absorbed by the skin, where they deactivate the effect of the UVA and UVB rays of the sun. Examples of chemical sunscreens are benzones, aminobenzoic acid and cinnamates. This particular sunscreen utilizes a physical block to the sun, which most dermatologists consider both safer and more effective than chemical sunscreens. Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, which are inorganic compounds, sit on the surface of the skin. Titanium dioxide is highly reflective, meaning that, like a mirror, it bounces UVA and UVB rays of the sun away from skin surfaces it is applied to. Zinc oxide provides a physical block primarily to UVA rays by absorbing it into itself rather than reflecting it. It also has the added advantage of being healing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are interested, I have included a list of the ingredients of this sunscreen and, though many are safe and even healthy--and there are no dangerous nano-particles--some of the ingredients are problematic. I have provided explanations for those ingredients that aren&#x27;t self-evident, natural ingredients, such as vitamin E and coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this particular brand of sunscreen, at that time it was the safest product I could find. I have since found several better options which I have listed at the bottom of this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide (6.0%), Titanium Dioxide (6.0%) (Guaranteed by Kiss My Face as \\&quot;non-nano minerals\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients: Water, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Juice, Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Acrylates Crosspolymer, Lecithin, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Agaricus Bisporus (Mushroom) Betaglucan, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Retinyl Acetate (Vitamin A), Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyglycerin, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Titanium dioxide: This substance has recently been classified as a possible carcinogen for humans. Fortunately, since it is included in a huge amount of cosmetics--and in essentially all sunscreen products--it appears that it is mainly carcinogenic when breathed in as a powder. The potential danger is also mitigated by the fact that dermatologists claim the skin does not absorb it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc Oxide: This substance is used as a sunscreen and to treat and prevent diaper rash and other minor skin irritations such as mild burns, cuts, and abrasions. It works by forming a barrier on the skin to protect it from irritants/moisture. Dermatologists claim the skin does not absorb it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acrylates Crosspolymer: This is a lab-derived, white powder appearing in just about every topical cosmetic and medication on the market. It is also used in chewable and sublingual tablets. Though considered safe enough to consume internally, some people develop an allergic reaction with long-term use leading to rashes and swelling (contact dermatitis).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cocamidopropyl Betaine: This is an organic compound derived from coconut oil and dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA). It is employed by the cosmetic industry in shampoos, bath gels, and hand soaps to increase foaming and as a medium-strength surfactant. It also works as an emulsifier and thickener and an anti-static agent in hair conditioners. It has some antiseptic properties, as well, and it is sometimes used on sanitary napkins. The DMAPA used to prepare cocamidopropyl betaine is itself produced via a chemical reaction between dimethylamine and acrylonitrile with a subsequent hydrogenation step. These two ingredients are anything but \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;safe\\&quot;: (1) Dimethylamine is an organic, colorless, flammable gas which smells like ammonia. It is utilized in vulcanizing rubber. Several industrial solvents are derived from it. It is a raw material used in the production of many agrichemicals. The chemical weapon tabun is created from it, as is the rocket fuel unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine. (2) Acrylonitrile is a chemical compound used primarily in the manufacture of plastics. It is highly flammable, toxic and is a known carcinogen, whether inhaled or absorbed through the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxyethanol: This is an organic glycol ether frequently used in cosmetics, vaccines and pharmaceuticals as a preservative. It is also used as a topical antiseptic, as an insect repellent, and as a solvent for dyes, inks, and resins. When information about the dangers of parabens became widely accepted, quite a few cosmetic companies switched to this preservative which initially seemed safe. Unfortunately, research has begun to reveal that it also may be toxic. Many people develop dermatitis from prolonged exposure to it. It can worsen skin conditions like eczema, and there is growing evidence that it may be a xenoestrogen like the parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethylhexyglycerin: Many cosmetic companies are also substituting this preservative for carcinogenic parabens. It is touted as being \\&quot;food grade,\\&quot; that is, you could safely eat it, because it is derived from vegetable oil. That claim is questionable in that the original vegetable oil is put through multiple chemical processes before arriving at the end product, ethylhexyglycerin. In addition, this preservative is relatively new and untested. Of the four studies so far published in the National Library of Medicine on this chemical, two of them have found it to be a skin irritant, even at low concentrations. This means that if you have sensitive skin, it may give you contact dermatitis. It can also be an eye irritant. So far, though, it has not been found to promote cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some alternatives to this product, which have healthy, natural, often organic ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0012ZMBDQ Badger]].

    <li> Spreads fine and the white tint disappears after a few minutes, but it leaves my face shiny and greasy. I&#x27;m giving my tube to a friend who has dry skin. Maybe she&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Out of all the natural sunscreens I have tried I like this one the best. I feel like it goes on smoother than most.</li>
    <li> Hydresia for clearer application, Natural ingredients, safe and very effective.  What a great product and what a selection - Continuous Spray, Sport, Kids, no hands necessary stick, face only.... Kiss my Face knows what they&#x27;re doing with sunscreen.  I wish our local stores would stock.</li>
    <li> This worked great for my toddler. It doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a white sheen on her, I would buy this again for sure.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it that much. It doesn&#x27;t rub in that well and it leaves a filmy feel throughout the day. (Probably because it is waterproof)</li>
    <li> i love this and it blends in nicely</li>
    <li> For blocking the sun, this product has great ingredients, but it is a bit thick and white to use as a facial sunblock.  I end up cutting it with a bit of a thinner sunscreen so I can look a bit less ghostly.</li>
    <li> I wanted to switch to healthier sunscreen and tried a couple before ending up with this. This goes on smoothly and provides great coverage (we life in Africa), but it does leave a white residue. I haven&#x27;t found a mineral based one that doesn&#x27;t, though. When I do, it will get 5 stars</li>
    <li> Thick.  Hard to spread.  Leaves a white film (and I&#x27;m white to begin with but it&#x27;s whiter).  It collects on neck lines and looks totally weird.  Won&#x27;t use it.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money.  It was a total waste.  I love the regular 30 SPF Kiss My Face, but this stuff is just awful.</li>
    <li> Goes on great even when wet!</li>
    <li> best sunscreen ever for the face!  no greasy feel, no smell.  Does leave a slightly &#x27;chalky&#x27; look (like face powder), but this goes away  after 10-15 minutes, and would not show at all if you used makeup.</li>
    <li> Best I have found....no odor</li>
    <li> I was looking for a all mineral sunscreen that did not contain oxybenzone. This works very good, though it does leave a white tint. It is worth a little tint to protect myself sufficiently.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t so sure about the sunscreen since it has a different smell to it. But it&#x27;s not a chemical smell, and you get used to it. I love that the sunscreen didn&#x27;t feel greasy and I didn&#x27;t have to use very much. It does leave a little bit of a white haze on your skin if you don&#x27;t rub it in well, but that&#x27;s the only slightly negative thing I can say about it. It definitely doesn&#x27;t last much over an hour - but most sunscreen you&#x27;re supposed to reapply occasionally, so that&#x27;s not a problem for me. I haven&#x27;t broken out from this, like I said previously it isn&#x27;t greasy, so my skin doesn&#x27;t look like I have sunscreen on, and it&#x27;s safe for you. Overall I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because EWG recommends it as an effective and safe sunscreen. All my research indicates that it&#x27;s quite safe and the primary sunscreen ingredients Zinc and Titanium Dioxide are both effective and safe. It seems to be doing a pretty good job as a sunscreen because I have sun allergy and when I have this cream on, I don&#x27;t get rashes even when I spend all day in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not that good as a mosturizer, however. My skin gets flaky and stays that away throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it leaves this whitish cast on your face, especially if you have brown skin. The effect stays for about an hour and then slowly fades away. To counter this, I put this on at least an hour before I go out and I check it in direct sunlight to blend in any white spots/streaks,especially near the hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this sunscreen, but I&#x27;ll probably try something different when I&#x27;ve used it up, just because it doesn&#x27;t look so good on my face, especially in bright light.</li>
    <li> got this for a winter trip to the Baja area.  We were out in the sun a lot both on land and in the water and did not get burned.  I dislike most suntan lotions and use them only out of necessity, but this one does not feel oily and stayed on well in water.  Actually (seemed to me anyway) helped as a skin softener too.  Would buy again</li>
    <li> Smells strongly of mayonnaise</li>
    <li> I did&#x27;t care for this product at all. I still have the bottle, I only tried using it once.</li>
    <li> Also bought the Sport Spray, so my reviews will be very much the same.  My daughter and I both have eczema and skin allergies and this is the ONE line we can use without a rash or hives.  IF you&#x27;re like us and can&#x27;t use anything else, and want a product that actually keeps you from getting burned, you might have good luck with this product line.  It IS a bit thick coming out of the tube, but we just give the tube a serious shake before dispensing.  I also let whatever I dispense into my palm sit there for a few moments to really warm it to body temp before applying.  This seems to help GREATLY in getting a smooth, even application.  It may be a bit thick in your hand, but I think it spreads and rubs in very well.  Plus on dry skin like ours, it moisturizes really well and soaks in fast.  It certainly beats premature aging and skin cancer.  When our supply runs out, I will definitely be reordering.</li>
    <li> I love the texture and works amazing!</li>
    <li> Goes on fairly smooth and clear. I still prefer md solar science but this is a nice alternative for when you don&#x27;t want to spend as much. I am very fair and have not burned using this on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this product may work well for some, but it does not go on clear like the label says.  I am brown skinned and this product leaves a white mask on my face each time.  It is also very dry.  I feel that I wasted my money, maybe I&#x27;ll just give it to a white friend or something.</li>
    <li> I now prefer to use Thinksport Livestrong as it is goes on even better over the long haul. This product has had a tendency to clump more after it had gotten hot (car, bag, etc) while the Livestrong did not.  The clumping did not go away after cooling down either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orginal review:&lt;br /&gt;We have been using Zinc Oxide (No Titanium) products for the last couple of years and have found a couple we like (Badger and Livestrong) and was hesitant to try this one.  But good EWG ratings and a clippable coupon got me to try it.  I think it is the best of the bunch so far and will be buying more.  It spreads easy and uniformly, the &#x27;white&#x27; disappears quickly and feels a little less greasy than the others - This may be attributed to more water and less oils, but it is much easier to apply to our 2 year old.  As for performance, since it spreads great I haven&#x27;t missed spots and neither of us have any burns.  It seems to work better than others when sweating also.</li>
    <li> I was planning to use this on my face and the body... I found it to be perfect for the body but not very suitable for my face as I have quite sensitive skin (keep in mind that products is not advertised to be used on the face I was just trying to save money and not buy a separate facial sunblock). Overall, it spreads \\&quot;comparatively\\&quot; easy, not too white, and absolutely non-greasy (on the body). It is  natural/mineral with a list of great ingredients. I like it.</li>
    <li> This is very thick, and makes my face sweat, but so far it&#x27;s one of the better sunscreens I&#x27;ve found without the extra chemicals.</li>
    <li> the ingredients are very safe and kept my fair toddler burn free all summer</li>
    <li> This does not spread on evenly. It leaves small dots of white lotion on the skin.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to trying this since I know it&#x27;s a pretty clean product.  I thought it was overly drying and it tended to go on thicker in some places than in others.  There&#x27;s very little product in this big ole tube too, I thought someone had accidentally sent me a used one but it was just little bit of lotion in a big ole tube.  I prefer Badger baby sunscreen by far.</li>
    <li> My husband and I use this and love that it is 40 and it feels great on our skin.</li>
    <li> This product leaves a white film on your skin and the film last until you shower, looks ridiculous. I would recommend it if you don&#x27;t care what it looks like.</li>
    <li> We recently took our toddler on a 3day camping trip that consisted of alot of 4wheeling and being in the sun for hours on a stretch, very sweaty.  We reapplied after the recomened amount of time and he came out of the weekend sunburn free.  It does rub in eliminating about 90% of the white color that you would see on your skin in traditional mineral sunblocks which is 100% better than looking like I am wearing a papermache mask and the smell is very neutral.  I plan to use ALOT of this in the upcoming weeks for swim lessons and general outdoor fun.  Will rebuy all summer long.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The mineral lotion sunscreen was recommended by Dr. Oz. I also like the fact that it is a SPF 40 for my face. I am very pleased with the price &amp; the seller. Definitely would buy this item again &amp; from this seller.</li>
    <li> Yes, there is some rubbing involved to avoid the vampire look, but once applied it&#x27;s the best ever. Sunscreens usually make my face look like an oil slick but this could be a makeup primer it&#x27;s so matte once absorbed. Also, and more importantly, it is ALL NATURAL!!! Will stick with this from now on!!!</li>
    <li> Love the ingredients, but its very thick.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen. Goes on easily, doesnt leave too much white on the skin and seems to work well.  I wish it was a bit more affordable and came in larger tubes for the amount we use.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s thick, so I don&#x27;t have to use a huge amount to get a good, even coat of it on my face. EWG rates it a 2, which is good, and it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive for what you&#x27;re getting. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes if it gets in them. It irritates them, but it doesn&#x27;t sting like other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used. The downsides are that it does go on white and stays that way for a couple hours. I don&#x27;t mind that much because I&#x27;m already pretty pale, and I don&#x27;t mind looking paler, but it does happen. Another issue is that it stays whiter longer in the areas of face in which I have facial hair (I keep it trimmed because I don&#x27;t like shaving). I end up having to wipe a little off from my upper lip and chin if I plan to go out (I wear it daily). But it&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
    <li> This product works very well, rubs in easier than most others (like Badger brand) doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor (like the sunflower oil based kind) and doesn&#x27;t leave the ghost look on kids faces.  Best of all, it was great for my very sensitive facial skin and my two kids who have very sensitive skin can use it with no problems.  Our favorite sunscreen-a must for beach trips!</li>
    <li> Thick, leaves a white coat, pasty and contains Titanium Dioxide which has a bad reputation for being toxic to skin.....very dissaponited.</li>
    <li> Great product but really pricey.  You can get a physical sunscreen from other stores for much less.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Offers a non-greasy, non-oily sunblock that lasts for hours. It doesn&#x27;t feel like I have anything on my face. Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This product arrived half full. This is the most expensive sunscreen I have bought considering that the tube maybe had a 1.7 oz in it when it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed with it considering the price of it.</li>
    <li> I got the kids the blue lizard sunscreen with mineral ingredients, and got the KMF one for myself.  The KMF smells nice, but that&#x27;s the only good part.  It gets crumbly, and is only stored in the house at room temp.  This happens over the course of the day on my face, which is not cool at work.  I suppose it&#x27;s possible that if I spent another 10 minutes rubbing it in, it would be fine, but the blue lizard doesn&#x27;t require that so I won&#x27;t be buying this brand again.  Now we all just use the blue lizard!</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in this product.  The cap broke quickly on both of the bottles I purchased.  Application was typical for a cream sunscreen so fine. My main dislike is that the duration of water resistance is shorter than some other &amp;#34;non chemical&amp;#34; brands.  You really have to be diligent in reapplying every 40 minutes of water play or you will likely burn if you are sensitive to the sun.  Given that and the fact that we are primarily using it on kids who swim all day long, I prefer the Thinksport sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This goes on evenly, my very allergic daughter has no reaction, and it smells nice.  Will purchase for our family again.</li>
    <li> Great product from a quick seller.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this sunscreen after reading the reviews, but I can&#x27;t quite recommend this for the face. It is quite thick since it is a natural mineral lotion (instead of using chemicals). Since I have combination skin it is too oily for parts of my face so I only apply to certain parts that I know would not break out. I use it on my body too since it&#x27;s quite a good mineral lotion regardless but if I applied heavier it leaves a white sheen. You have to carefully patiently layer one at a time in order to avoid the sheen.  There are also small white scrubbing bead sized particulates each time I dispense so I&#x27;m not used to that.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen without all the toxic chemicals found in most sunscreens.  It takes a little longer to rub into the skin but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I picked this product based on its evaluation by the Environmental Working Group.  I use sunscreen profusely and I figured it makes sense to find a product that is safer to my body  (I was shocked to find that the Neutrogena sunscreen I have been using was considered to be a high risk product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few issues I have with this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The texture is a bit watery and uneven.  The lotion at the opening of the tube is always a bit crusty and not easy to even out.  If not applying in front of the mirror (which is quite often in my case), you risk leaving a few white crumb on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It said &amp;#34;it is enriched with hydresia for ultra moisturizing water resistant&amp;#34;.  I must say I don&#x27;t feel it is moisturizing at all.  In fact it feels quite dry minutes after applying on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is an inevitable trade-off of opting for a safer product but I will try other safe brand after using up this one.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the consistency. It had separated in the tube and was difficult to apply. It did smell better than similar sunscreens. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> No product is perfect for everyone, but this one gets really close for me. At first the thickness of the product took some getting used to, and I remedied this by mixing it with a little water before I applied it (making sure not to apply too little still, because after all, it&#x27;s sunscreen and should be applied liberally). Soon I noticed that this is not only a superb sunscreen but also a magnificent moisturizer. My skin is generally very oily and prone to acne and irritation. This product is gentle, it moisturizes without feeling heavy or increasing oiliness, and it even calms irritated acne. It&#x27;s also pretty cheap for the quality! And need I mention the recycled container and lack of animal testing? So, all in all, I highly recommend trying this product for yourself.</li>
    <li> I took this to Florida with me and did not get burned at all! I really worked very well.  The only bad part to this sunscreen is that it is kind of greasy and left my hands with an odd coating to it. I did not like the feel of it as I rubbed it onto my skin.</li>
    <li> I like the product it blends in ok.......but the tube was half full when it arrived!!! Very misleading and expensive!</li>
    <li> So far it seems to be a great product. It rubs on kind of thick but soaks into my skin pretty quickly leaving it smooth. I put it under my makeup everyday.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this lotion after reading EWG&#x27;s data base. Unfortunately, it arrived half empty. The bottle itself doesn&#x27;t look like empty, but if you look at it through the light you&#x27;ll notice that the lotion is in the bottom of the tube.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that the sunscreen is without all the chemicals and it works very well.  It does leave a white streak on the body, but this helps to see where you covered.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be better, @ first no matter how much I shook it it would still come out like water .  It finally hardened up after the fourth time use.  Other than that I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s natural! Works well, but is VERY hard to spread. Won&#x27;t be buying again, going to try their spray on.</li>
    <li> This is good for people with sensitive skin or people who question the safety of the chemicals in traditional sunscreens. These zinc oxide sunscreens also do a much better job of shielding UVA rays as well as UVB. If you are looking for a tan, you won&#x27;t bronze with this (and you probably won&#x27;t burn much either). If you are looking for a product to protect your skin so you look radiant at age 50 instead of like a paper bag, you should probably check this out.</li>
    <li> I use sun screen a lot and was looking for something without any potentially harmful substances.  Kiss my Face is supposed to be one of the better products, not as easy to use as my prior brand but it does not have the same amount of controversial ingredients</li>
    <li> We are quite fair skinned and find this sunscreen to work well. It has a good safety rating on Environmental Working Group website, and it has a mild scent if any. Absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin looking whiter than it was before you put on the sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t feel as thick or heavy or greasy as many sunscreens do. It&#x27;s our go-to sunscreen now!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get burnt, but this product does not &amp;#34;blend in clear&amp;#34; as stated on the label.  Also, the package was only about half full - which seems to be consistent (I found this at my local Sprouts and all of the bottles there were filled the same).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does have a nutty smell to it, but it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
    <li> This is the second Summer we have used Kiss My Face sunscreen products, including Kiss My Face Natural Mineral Lotion Sunscreen SPF 40 with Hydresia, 3 Fluid Ounce, Kiss My Face Natural Mineral Sun Spray SPF 30 Sunscreen Lotion, 8 Ounce and this year, Kiss My Face Cool Sport Continuous Spray SPF 50, Coconut, 6 Ounce. Prior to that we have tried TruKid and Badger. Years ago I had a huge box of Piz Buin samples, one of the original physical barrier sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the lotion products can be difficult to apply and spread evenly. With the KMF 40, (this years seamed to be a bit thinner than last years) we found that to spread evenly, you need to make little dots about half a pea, every 1.5 - 2 inches apart and then spread thin. If you put a blob on your hand and try to spread like you would moisturizer, it will be very difficult to spread which results in looking very white and using way too much product. With the dot technique, you should get full coverage and minimize the white factor, but because this is a physical barrier, it will never completely disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used correctly, all of the KMF products we have used worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emphasis the \\&quot;use correctly\\&quot; because they must be applied and RE-APPLIED, as directed. Time flies at the beach so skipping or going way over time on the re-application is easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other KMF sunscreens we used, I would add this to the review. The Kiss My Face Natural Mineral Sun Spray SPF 30 Sunscreen Lotion, 8 Ounce works well and applies easier than the KMF 40 with this caveat ... it is NOT WATER RESISTANT and states so on the label and in the description. It will wash off in the water. I have seen in other reviews that it sprays out in globs (or whatever) I believe the fact that the ingredients include the suspended particles of Titanium and Zinc, you need to shake it. It is not a mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kiss My Face Cool Sport 50 Spray was a nice addition this year, smells good and worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what worked best for us? Prior to leaving for the beach, we applied the KMF 40 lotion and and since the lotions can be a bit of a challenge to apply at the beach because of the sand, for reapplication at the we used the KMF Cool Sport 50 Spray. Shortly after we got out of the water and had a chance to dry off, we used the spray, with probably 45 - 60 minutes between applications. The KMF SPF 40 never completely washed off and the Cool Sport is incredibly easy to apply, the perfect combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five straight days of beautiful, clear, sunny weather, 2 adults, one tween .... NO SUNBURN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiss My Face products are great.</li>
    <li> It happens to be too runny.</li>
    <li> The product I received was watery and it looked as if the cream had separated. Put it on my son who has medium tan skin and he was sunburned in a few hours. About to toss it and go back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get burnt while wearing it, and I was in the water, so I believe it is waterproof for awhile. I took a star away because it really is difficult to rub it in. Also, make sure to shake it before you use it - it separates and you need to mix it back up.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I received it in the mail.  It had obviously been used and there wasn&#x27;t much left in the bottle.  I would love to have had this new, it would have been nice to try.  I don&#x27;t know who used it but I hope they enjoyed it!</li>
    <li> I like this for my face, its not greasy and lasts all day, But I find it hard to rub in, its like it dries the second it touches your skin. Also it does not dry clear, it leaves a very white film on skin. It is great under makeup though so I dont mind the white.</li>
    <li> I had to knock one star off because if i remember correctly, Kiss my Face said this product went on clear. It does not. It goes on white. What I have done to make sure this blends in a bit more is I use a moisturizer underneath (Lush&#x27;s Charity Pot) and then use the product over that. Other than that, I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is a very high rated sunscreen in terms of good for your body (less chemicals, etc.).  I bought it for that reason.  This sunscreen works very well but I don&#x27;t like the slightly white residue.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t contain all the chemicals and it&#x27;s effective. Took this on a trip to Mexico and used almost the entire bottle in 6 days. Not a trace of sunburn and that says a lot when you consider how much time we spent in the sun and the majority of time in either the pool or the ocean. It seems to have great staying power. There were 8 of us and we used it mostly on the highly sentive areas, face, neck, ears.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent sunscreen. It does blend in easy and is not greasy at all. I have sensitive skin and I have no reaction to it at all.I love it. I did not like a lot of sunscreens as they made me real greasy. It protects my skin very well.</li>
    <li> Yes, you have to shake it up before you squeeze it out, and yes, it goes on thick and white, so you have to rub it in, but that was so worth it to  me, to know it was safe for my skin.  It worked great, because I followed the directions, and re-applied it when i was supposed to do so.  I will use this again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural sunscreen and this has high quality ingredients, but unfortunately it is really chalky and seems to dry my skin out. I will continue to use it for my kids until it runs out, but I need something less drying.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I disagree with another reviewer that complained of the white chalky face.  I found this stuff absorbent with only a very faint whitening effect. You want a total white-face, try the Badger brand (which I like too). The main point is that it does a good job of blocking the rays on myself and my three year old and holds up well in pool and ocean. The only problem is that the stuff is pretty liquid and you will go through it fast. But then again, sunblock is not meant to be savored!!</li>
    <li> This goes on with a whiter film than another physical sunscreen I use. Also, it is not as moisturizing as it says it is. My skin still felt dry when I put it on. I am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I like Livestrong&#x27;s \\&quot;Thinkbaby\\&quot; much better (does not leave a chalky white film) and is also all mineral. See my reviews for it as well as other physical mineral sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised other people gave it higher ratings because it was disappointing. I originally gave it 3 stars, but now I am lowering it to 2 stars because I&#x27;m suspicious that the seller is tampering with reviews by submitting false reviews.</li>
    <li> I looked this up via an ingredient list since most sunscreen have cancer causing ingredients! I love it and it works well on all of us, despite having that super light Irish skin that burns so easily. I smells great, you can sweat and it doesn&#x27;t burn the eyes, and actually leaves you softer &amp;#60;3 couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the sunscreens on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s safe sunscreen list and this is one of my favorites.  While it does leave a very small amount of white residue on my skin, it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as many of the other sunscreens that contain zinc and/or titanium dioxide.  I have dry skin and this product feels moisturizing on my skin.  I would recommend to others and I would order it again.</li>
    <li> While this doesn&#x27;t feel as silky and smooth as a regular commercial sunscreen, it was way better than the mineral sunscreen I tried last year that felt like a pure zinc oxide paste. I used Kiss My Face recently for a two hour visit to the beach near Florida in peak sun. I went in the water twice and applied it twice. I got just a touch of sun -- perfect. I will purchase this again.</li>
