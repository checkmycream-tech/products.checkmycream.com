      <li>Put the tiniest bit on after hair is dry rather than putting it on wet hair for the best result.</li>
      <li>and this is the first success I&#x27;ve</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this brand</li>
      <li>I can only speak for this one, but this one is magic.</li>
      <li>So far I use it in my face and it felt smooth and not greasy</li>
      <li>I use it first thing in the morning on my hands and face.</li>
      <li>I have had many different brands.</li>
      <li>and I was really interested to hear what she had to say about it.</li>
      <li>her hand became red and more itchy, so we&#x27;ll use to de-frizz hair instead.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a hot oil treatment but without the greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I first came across this Argan oil on my work colleague’s desk.</li>

      <li>I feel compelled to share because this is the magic tonic we’re all looking for but never expect to actually find, and we girls have to stick together and share these secrets.</li>
      <li>then I was spending the night at a friend’s house and all she had was this pretty brown bottle of MARRAKËSH Argan Oil.</li>
      <li>Since using it, my skin is now much younger looking, and also has a vibrant healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love that this is 100% pure because I don&#x27;t like putting strange chemicals in my hair or on my body.</li>
      <li>It’s pure, and that’s part of the secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>’s important to note at the start that results are totally dependent on the quality of oil used, and</li>
      <li>Skin feels so much softer now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried my whole life to grow nails</li>
      <li>It holds both curls and straight looks in place.</li>
      <li>My wife developed a rash from using Gold Bond Lotion ... that has a long list of chemical ingredients, many alcohols, including chamomile (in the ragweed family).  </li>
      <li>Bought mainly to rub in my hair to nourish and control.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an extraordinary product for my skin and especially for my hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this Argan Oil</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just started using this Moroccan oil on my nails and I genuinely like what I&#x27;m seeing. It leaves a shine that’s nicer looking than polish, but what I&#x27;m really starting to appreciate is the strength it’s providing. I have naturally weak nails that I can’t grow. Polish just seemed to make them more brittle and prone to split and crack. The argan oil is penetrating my nails and preventing that brittle breakup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rub the oil into my cuticles and nail bed, and already I can feel the new growth becoming thicker and stronger. I&#x27;ve tried my whole life to grow nails and this is the first success I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I&#x27;m going to follow some of the other reviewer’s suggestion and use it on my hair. If it has similar results, I&#x27;m going to be very, very pleased.</li>
    <li> I feel compelled to share because this is the magic tonic we’re all looking for but never expect to actually find, and we girls have to stick together and share these secrets. That said, I have been reading lately that argan oil is becoming less and less of a secret. I may regret sharing because the best argan oil, like this one, is produced by hand, so it’s becoming harder to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s important to note at the start that results are totally dependent on the quality of oil used, and I can only speak for this one, but this one is magic. It’s cold-pressed 100% argan oil, so no filler, no perfume, no alcohol. It’s pure, and that’s part of the secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s just the most appealing of things I’ve discovered you can do with this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: It revitalizes hair. It not only makes dull hair look shiny, it fills in the damage and makes hair thicker and stronger which results in a fuller look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2: Restores collagen. Naturally filled with omega oils and vitamin e, argan oil feeds and plumps the collagen under your skin which in turn results in a youthful appearance. Wrinkles smooth away into nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3: Nails are strengthened. Rub it into your nails and cuticles and you’ll see them growing out stronger with less cracks and breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4: Stops acne. With natural antibacterial agents, argan oil stops acne and heals the skin of scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5: Diminishes and prevents scars. Rubbed on stretch marks and other scars, the healing properties in this oil slowly fades away even deep scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6: Prevents infection and helps quickly heal burns, rashes, scratches, and cuts without scarring. Again,  it’s down to argan’s natural antibacterial agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7: Makeup removal. It deep cleans and moisturizes without leaving any oily residue. Then read #2 again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, let me reiterate, these effects are only possible with a high quality 100% Morrocan Argan oil that has been cold pressed and stored so as not to oxidize. The only way to know what you’ve got is by trial and error, and I’ve tried and erred. This is by far the best and most effective argan oil I’ve found.d stored so as not to oxidize. The only way to know what you’ve got is by trial and error, and I’ve tried and erred. This is by far the best and most effective argan oil I’ve found.</li>
    <li> Good purchase. Arrived in plenty of time with packaging intact. Seems to work well when hair is heat treated after use - i.e. do not just towel dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed such a difference since I&#x27;ve been using this oil. It&#x27;s an extraordinary product for my skin and especially for my hair. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else now that I&#x27;ve discovered it.</li>
    <li> While I also use this oil on my skin and nails, I got it for my hair. It does a few things you would be hard pressed to get a conditioner, hairspray, and styling gel to do, and it does it naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First it makes damaged and dull hair shine again. It fills in the brittle pores and coats the hair is a fine sheen, but it is not in the slightest bit oily. I know of no other oil that will do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, while it is filling in the pores, it gives volume to hair. Thin and aging hair will especially benefit, but so will basic limp and lifeless hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works as an excellent styling product. It holds both curls and straight looks in place. And if you&#x27;re going to style with heat, like straightening irons and blow dryers, this just further enhances its benefits. It&#x27;s like a hot oil treatment but without the greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s great for skin and nails, but as hair is my primary problem, that&#x27;s what I am most impressed with. Just put a small amount in the palm of your hand, rub your hands together and then run them through your hair. If you have long hair with more damage on the end, do a second application there, and then style as normal. You&#x27;ll see the first amazing results in a day, and then in a week, you&#x27;ll see the health of your hair improve further.</li>
    <li> Does it supposed to smell this bad??? is not nutty, is not olive oil, is not non-smelling either... it has a strange scent.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  Bought mainly to rub in my hair to nourish and control.  Found that putting it on my dry arms has helped tremendously.  Great product.  Good supplier.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This oil has been the best thing I have used for my face. I wash with honey and use the Argan oil as a moisturizer. At night I&#x27;ll use frankincense or lavender essential oil with the Argan oil.  It cleared up my small acne bumps and my skin complexion looks more even.  My skin looks better than it has in a few years.</li>
    <li> I first came across this Argan oil on my work colleague’s desk. She’s from Morocco and I was really interested to hear what she had to say about it. She’s very familiar with how Argan oil is supposed to feel, smell, and look, and she told me this was the best she’d seen. Considering she used to eat this oil, I figure she knows her stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was so glad to find it on Amazon. I use it because it fulfills all the criteria I require in a moisturizer, such as rejuvenating skin by replenishing collagen, but I also like that it helps with my arthritis. I use it first thing in the morning on my hands and face. I find it helps my fingers ache less within 15 minutes of applying it. Since using it, my skin is now much younger looking, and also has a vibrant healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have enjoyed using this product so much that I recommend it to all my family and friends. I hope you too can enjoy the same benefits I have with this lovely Moroccan oil.</li>
    <li> This product has made a huge difference in the health of my nails and cuticles.</li>
    <li> This 100% Pure virgin Argan Oil is wonderful. I received this at a discounted price, during a promotion for my honest and unbiased opinion. The oil itself is amazing quality. I tried it out on my hand first, and it made my skin feel amazing. I also put a tiny bit on my hair after I styled it, to keep the frizz away and it works like a charm. I love that this is 100% pure because I don&#x27;t like putting strange chemicals in my hair or on my body. I also use this to moisturize my tattoos as they look faded without some moisture on them. Even after this Virgin Argan Oil from Lagoon Essentials is soaked in, my skin stays bright and soft/ It absorbs quickly so no worries about it staining my cloths or feeling sticky. Can&#x27;t go wrong with a product from Lagoon Essentials. I highly recommend this Argan Oil</li>
    <li> I use this every day on my face and the results are amazing. It absorbs so fast!!! I&#x27;m really enjoying my experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this brand and I&#x27;m never going to look back to anything else. Nothing I&#x27;ve tried even come close to comparing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day, once in the morning after my shower and again before going to bed, and I could not be happier with how my skins feels and looks.</li>
    <li> My wife ask where did buy this for such a great price,on a really good site they have every thing you want for your body for sure. Thank You Golden Bird</li>
    <li> I am truly pleased with this product. It is non greasy and I feel as if I am doing something righteous for my skin when I use it.</li>
    <li> This is as good as what Josie Marin sells on QVC, but more reasonable!</li>
    <li> If you want nice hair, this is the stuff for you! It transforms frizzy hair into an enviable sleek mane. Put the tiniest bit on after hair is dry rather than putting it on wet hair for the best result.</li>
    <li> I use this as a cleanser,leaving it on my skin for about five minutes then either rinsing with warm water or using a tissue.It is great for getting off all of the grime and cleansing the pores.Then I apply a bit as moisturizer, especially at night.Skin feels so much softer now.</li>
    <li> Great oil!  I use as a moisturizer on my face and love it!</li>
    <li> I became an Argan oil convert by accident, and I’ve never experienced a better one. I use waterproof mascara, and everyone who uses a good brand knows the only thing that fully removes waterproof mascara is oil. The problem with most oils is you’re left with a film of grease on your eyes that prevents properly using mascara the next morning; and the only thing that removes oil is alcohol, but then you have alcohol in your eyes. Tears of pain were the dramatic end to most of my days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I was spending the night at a friend’s house and all she had was this pretty brown bottle of MARRAKËSH Argan Oil. Wow. Just wow. So many wows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First it removed my super-duper waterproof mascara, and all other eye make-up as well, but the wow was because it did not leave behind a film of greasy oil. It absorbed directed and smoothly into my skin. It felt like velvet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was instantly sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And really, that would have been good enough to make me happy for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then, second bigger WOW: a week later I noticed the wrinkles around my eyes had faded. The skin was plump and firm. This little bottle did what other eye tonics promise but never deliver. To say I blown away does not even begin to cover my happy surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, I expanded for bigger results, and now I use it as an allover anti-aging tonic for my face and neck. It is beyond brilliant.</li>
    <li> Still experimenting with this product. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Finally found an Argan oil that moisturizes my hair and make it shine. It&#x27;s great on the cuticles too.</li>
    <li> I have been using Argan Oil for over a month now.  I love it.  I am 69 with all grey hair.  I use the oil on my face as a moisturizer both in the morning and at night. My skins is so soft now, and my grey hair glistens with shine when I add it to my hair.  I am happy to see these different uses customers have discovered and found helpful!  I look forward to trying them!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my curly fine hair. The oil is light and fragrant and adds shine and definition to my hair. It certainly is soft and no longer straw like - hurray! I&#x27;ve used argan oil but found it on the heavy side, I much prefer to use this.</li>
    <li> Best Argan oil I&#x27;ve used. Authentic. Great results. Good value for money.</li>
    <li> My wife developed a rash from using Gold Bond Lotion ... that has a long list of chemical ingredients, many alcohols, including chamomile (in the ragweed family).  She wore many bandages on her right hand with many skin-cracks, plus red rashes.  She tried this Argan oil and loved it ... it absorbs instantly, and doesn&#x27;t make the PC mouse greasy like almond oil, avocado oil, coconut oil, or olive oil.  It&#x27;s clean, light myrrh scent that evaporates, and absorb 100% into the skin.  It&#x27;s great on dry &amp; cracked feet, and doesn&#x27;t make socks greasy like Aveeno or Vaseline.  UPDATE:  After a few months, my wife developed a rash from Argan oil:  her hand became red and more itchy, so we&#x27;ll use to de-frizz hair instead.</li>
    <li> Has a slight smell. Not sure if that is its natural smell or if it has gone rancid. I have had many different brands. Some had had this smell while others don&#x27;t. It seems to dissipate after a few minutes on the skin. Great moisture with one single ingredient. That&#x27;s fantastic for me!</li>
    <li> I looooove this oil. I have used all types of skin care, for organic to La Mer, etc. I love this stuff. I put it on my skin every night, on the tips of my hair, and during the day, I put it over my serum and location. The consistency is perfect, and I hope they never change anything about this product.</li>
    <li> love it on my face and  hands, use often also as carrier oil for essential oils.</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes my hair soft and shiney. I also used it in my homemade lip balm. Awesome and authentic.</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE this oil!!  I use it when I give myself a color.  A few drops and voila&#x27;, the hair has instant shine!</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil is brilliant stuff! It has a lightweight, non-greasy texture keeping my face hydrated throughout my day. I can also remove my eye make-up because it doesn´t irritate my eyes like some of the chemical stuff that is being sold around the drugstores these days. I have been using it also on my cracked heels an it´s working pretty damm fine! I love it, really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like this product has kind of a nutty smell. I have not been using it for that long to give a full review. So far I use it in my face and it felt smooth and not greasy just one drop is all you need. Will keep you posted for an up to date status on the product.</li>
