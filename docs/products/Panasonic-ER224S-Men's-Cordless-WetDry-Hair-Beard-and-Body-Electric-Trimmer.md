<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Worked well. Broke the comb on the second day. I dropped it on carpet but man is that plastic light.</li>
    <li> I like it except that it is difficult to take the plastic guard off for cleaning plus you have to oil it periodically which is a mess. Had one before that was self sharpening and never needed oiling but can&#x27;t find the brand now. I really like having each level in one without changing heads and like how it clips. I would probably buy one like it again if lasts for 2 to 3 years.</li>
    <li> awesome for manscaping</li>
    <li> Not as good as my old one, I ended up using it for spare parts to my old one</li>
    <li> Worked well but made weak on the trimmer teeth and it broke where the plastic is too thin.  I threw it away and both a differnt make.. Too bad, Panasonic is usually great and bullet proof.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this clipper set. Everything you need without taking up a ton of space. The adjustable trimming length feels fragile, but I&#x27;ve used it a ton of times without it breaking, like others are saying. I suggest just being a little more cautious. Charges fast, and lasts long. I would buy these clippers again.</li>
    <li> Save your money. I bought one and really liked the way it cut. After a few months the guard broke. I figured I was just a little rough with it. I bought a 2nd one. Even being genial with it the guard broke in weeks.</li>
    <li> Great, work like a charm</li>
    <li> Well received, Good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit works very well. The Quick adjust dial is very usefull.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice but i can&#x27;t shave my under my chin.</li>
    <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;working well</li>
    <li> I used it for 4 or 5 times and it&#x27;s not working anymore, no power, charge it for 8 hours and still not turning on :(</li>
    <li> Received this couple months ago and so far so good. I usually cut my hair ever two weeks and have had no issues with it. The quick dial allows for easy adjustable settings. Only issue so far is some pieces of hair get stuck inside the trimmer and need to be cleaned out thoroughly each time.</li>
    <li> Comb isn&#x27;t that easy to get off but they are very functional</li>
    <li> Very few complaints.  The clipper doesn&#x27;t come off easily and it&#x27;s necessary to do so if you want to use the side trimmer for sideburns.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for an identical model that I have had for over 9 years that is starting to have its battery run down.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have purchased a lot of beard/hair clippers over the year&#x27;s &amp; this is my all-time favorite. Quick charge, cordless, doesn&#x27;t rip hair out, easy to clean, &amp; price was great. Excellent product, would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> i thought it was wonderful until a couple of weeks ago.  i purchased this item less than 3 months ago.  i&#x27;ve used it maybe 10 times.  the 11th attempt it will not work.  it&#x27;s fully charged but appears locked...not a hum, nothing.  i&#x27;ve consistently used Wahl brand plug in electric shavers for over a decade and when they fail after a year or 3 i feel like i got my money&#x27;s worth.  this one was oiled for every use and still failed.  it&#x27;s beyond 30 days so i can&#x27;t even return or have it replaced</li>
    <li> I was quite pleased with this product until I tried to recharge it;  unfortunately, the battery and/or charger failed to work.  I probably got 10 uses out of the initial charge, and then it did not operate.  I had it on the recharger for approximately 26 hours (the manual said it could take 16) with the indicator light on red, and nothing.  I really don&#x27;t know if boxing everything up and sending in on a parts warranty, then waiting for it to be returned, etc. is worth the hassle for a $30 item.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer mentioned the adjustable comb that messures the required length is flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;It is required to remove it to access the smaller trim tool that pops up, but it doesn&#x27;t come&lt;br /&gt;off easily and ultimately breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another flaw I discovered is that when using the small pop up trim tool, the full&lt;br /&gt;trimmer is still running and if your not careful can attack other parts of your beard&lt;br /&gt;while you are fine tuning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb is broken so I have to throw it away.</li>
    <li> The product is nice, silent and works perfectly for me: the only (BIG) disadvantage is the rating of the charger (100-120V AC ONLY). If you are planning to travel for long period of time better to tell the family that you may come back with a long beard so they can recognize you at the front door! It is totally unacceptable that a lessa than 0.2W (55mA at 2.6V!) charger is shipped with a single AC voltage when chargers for smartphones are shipped with 1/4 of the size, more than 10 times of the wattage and multi range input. Aside of this inconvenience ... I am happy!</li>
    <li> I bought this years ago and I had it for a few years before I bought another type.  I bought this Panasonic All-in-One again because it works well for me.  I like the simple design and the adjustable lenght.  It´s easy to use and adjust!  I have read the the top part/removable tip breaks on people.  Mine has not.  Maybe I´m lucky, or I´m gentle with it, I´m not sure, but it works fine.  I do light trimming and wash out the head in the bathroom sink.  I like the fact that you can charge it, and use it without the cord: a simple idea that makes it easy to use.  A year ago, I had another wet-dry body trimmer and I wasn´t happy with it.  It didn´t work well in the shower, the hair stuck to the blade.  The battery didn´t last long and the hair settings wasn´t good for my liking.  Overall, I´m happy with this Panasonic for the ease and settings.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer- I use it to give my fiance haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I knocked a star off is because the comb attachment fills with hair very quickly.  I have to pull it off to empty the hair out every few seconds when the hair is long, then dial it back to the right length.  This has, on more than one occasion, resulted in him getting a buzzcut because in my haste I forgot to dial it back to the length he wanted.  The attachment does not come off very easily, either, and I think I am going to break it every time I need to pull it off.  However, we have had it for over a year and it hasn&#x27;t broken yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I love that I can rinse the whole thing out with water.  The clippers come out really easily to allow you to clean it pretty thoroughly.  Of course, I am pretty much incapable of putting the clippers back in, but my fiance can do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and he says he can&#x27;t use it to trim his beard.  He keeps it pretty short so the shortest comb length is too long, but without the comb it is too short.  Plus it&#x27;s too wide.  He has a different trimmer he uses for his beard.  He has used the beard trimmer pop-up on this device to clean up the edges of his beard or make ridiculous patterns in his facial hair, though.  So there&#x27;s that.</li>
    <li> This is my second one thank god they still make it, I wore the first one out ! This is best trimmer you will ever buy.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. The trim length is easily adjustable with the turn of a dial so there&#x27;s no more fumbling around trying to find the right attachment. And the cover comes off for a closer shave and makes shaping a breeze.</li>
    <li> Just as described.  My husband had already owned this same razor for almost 10 years.  This is an even better version!</li>
    <li> We luv the convenience of the design and recharging capabilities. Adjustments are done with ease. We have to be careful with the head, in that it is a bit fragile, and may be broken easily.</li>
    <li> Very nice, value for money. This is the second one, the first one I purchased  in 2006, but still works well.</li>
    <li> Totally not what it seems. First off, the clip does not come off and all the hairs get stuck in the clip. Secondly, I tried rinsing the hairs down the drain just as the nice picture indicate and it was a disaster. You will need to spray this machine with a HIGH PRESSURE HOST in order to remove the hair from unremovable clip.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second set of these.  The first set lasted about 2 years and worked perfectly for that time.  For the price, I&#x27;m satisfied with that.  The absolute ONLY criticism I can provide is that the plastic trimmer guard is a pain.  It works like it should, but is very difficult to remove and replace when trimming with the bare blade.  I&#x27;ve read elsewhere that they are prone to breaking...presumably due to how difficult they are to maneuver taking on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, my previous one didn&#x27;t break until recently.  I could have replaced it for a few dollars here on amazon, but the blades and battery were beginning to ware and it&#x27;s cheaper to buy a new one than to rejuvenate an old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the design, quality, functionality, and build of these trimmers.  I use them for shaving my face, trimming a beard or goatee when I wear one, and for cutting my hair.  All with one device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this one, don&#x27;t waste your money.  1) Due to the design defect, the hair will be held in the comb attachment, it&#x27;s very difficulte to take it out, and the clipper does not cut anymore. 2) The adjust dial is loose, even a little pressure on the comb attachment will cause a length setting   change when you cut your hair, think about that, a disaster! 3) The battery charge time is way more than 8 hrs which the seller claims.</li>
    <li> I owned one of these for a while until it broke, then I got the same one again. I like the versatility and that it is so easy to clean and rinse under water. The only caveat is that the hair can clog the trimmer, and to clean it the adjustable guard needs to be removed. When you put the guard back on to continue, it is easy to dial in a wrong (too short) setting by accident. But eventually I learned to look out for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now here is the reason why I am writing this review: The rechargeable battery on my trimmer was getting progressively worse, so I decided to try and replace it. It is possible to carefully open the trimmer with the right screwdrivers. Inside, you will discover a single NiCd AA cell. I tested it with my trusty LaCrosse charger, and was told it had around 580mAh capacity left, which was barely enough to last through a single use of the trimmer. Also, the battery would usually self-discharge in a day or two, and combined with the very slow charger, it meant that I needed to charge the trimmer a day or so in advance to actually use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed the NiCd AA cell and soldered a single NiMH AA Eneloop in its place instead. This new cell has around 1850mAh and virtually no self-discharge. This means the shaver will now run 3x as long as before, and when I leave it in the drawer for a week or a month, it will not have lost its charge. The motor turns faster too. I took some care to make sure that the case was properly water-proofed again during assembly, and all is well now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why can&#x27;t Panasonic put a good battery into their trimmers to begin with?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of these over the last 10 years. Works beautifully for managing beard and, in my case, buzzing a tragic pate into uniformity. Every time I use this thing, up I am gratified by the hundreds of dollars tat it saves me each and every year. A great deal.</li>
    <li> Works great for the price.</li>
    <li> When buying a pair of clippers you have to think, $20-$30 for something that will save you a ton of money in the end.  I watch poeple get $10 haircuts every 2-3 weeks, insane.  Think about it, saves about $25 a month for a year equals $300.  After 5 years I saved around $1500 on haircuts.  That covered alot of books and such during school.    So I have had this product for over 5 years, all through college, and it has been wonderful.  I cut my hair every 8-10 days, I like to keep it short, and shave my face with it every 3 days...no problems at all.  Plus the adjustable length is really nice, no switching the clips all the time, just dial it and go to work.  I will be buying it again here shortly.</li>
    <li> If you intend on using this to cut any amount of hair on your head, let me save you some time and shipping charges:  Move directly to Step 3.    If your hair is already incredibly short (think less than 1/2 inch), this will do the job for you.  If you have let your hair grow out and you want to use this to shave that, forget it.  Don&#x27;t.  Why?  Because, every pass with this shaver clogs the guard and you will need to remove the guard, shake it out, and reattach.  After EVERY pass through your hair.  What usually takes 4 minutes, took me at least a half hour.      I wanted a cordless trimmer so I could go outside and keep the hair there and not all over the bathroom.  However, since this trimmer was such a piece of garbage, I had to go inside for the mirror (and on my way inside, I was laughed at because my hair looked ridiculous) and now, voila ... hair all over the bathroom.    This is NOT an all-in-one trimmer.  It&#x27;s a one-in-one -- short hair ONLY.</li>
    <li> One quick test is all it takes to learn how to use this trimmer to get the results you want. Would like a zero setting for the top of my head but 1 is close.  Not yet enough use to comment on battery life.</li>
    <li> I have used it for several years and there are goods and bads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It works fine except battery. Workmanship is good except for cons. For $20, it is worth it. If it is more than that, not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Battery was dead very soon right after the warranty period--I need to charge it for a few hours before it becomes usable, and it lasts only for a short time even when I do not use it. Amazon web site says \\&quot;Cordless operation of 40 minutes on a 8 Hour charge\\&quot;. There is no code available. Plastic guard is fragile and very easy to break--but there is a generic replacements available (Panasonic ER224 Beard Trimmer Comb Attachment $5.38 at Amazon). I would not try washing the guard each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is if you are patient charging for a few hours each time, it will be ok. If $20 is not bothering, it will be fine to buy a new one.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this item along with a Panasonic shaver. I used them both for about 5 minutes. two days later I turned this trimmer on again and it did not work. I first thought it was out of charge and recharged it and nothing! The shaver works pretty good but this product cannot be a Panasonic or must be the bad apple. Very disappointing! I thought of sending it for a repair and I read the details of the warranty and I have to pay for shipping both ways and insure and all that. The item itself is less than $30. I would probably end up paying more for shipping it for repair and besides I have to chase it around; lots of headache! I would say be cautious!</li>
    <li> Mechanically the shaver works just fine. However the guard is made of a flimsy plastic, is hard to remove from the shaver and breaks easily.  Regardless of how well the shaver works if the guard breaks it&#x27;s useless.  I will not be purchasing another one.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT IT FROM BEST BUY AND RETURNED NEXT DAY. IT DOES NOT CUT HAIR. IT IS NOT HAIR CLIPPER.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after using Philips/Norelco units for the past 10 years. My most recent trimmer suddenly died after the rechargeable battery gave out, preventing me from using it plugged into AC as well -- what a great design feature! This unit has a good feel in the hand, the blade seems to be of decent quality, and I really like the way the trimmer guard setting locks when the unit is turned on, preventing the setting from changing by pressing too hard on the guard while using. The only gripe that I have is the guard seems to be rather flimsy, as others here have noted. Aside from that, this looks like money well spent.  ** update ** 11/05/2011  I have been using this trimmer now for a few months, and I need to revise my original review.  Pros:  - motor has descent power  - high quality of main cutting blade  - descent quality rechargeable battery  - excellent design of comb length lock -- unit will power off if it moves while in use  Cons:  - comb attachment is very flimsy and will not last as long as the trimmer itself  - detail pop-up trimmer is NOT nearly the quality of the main trimmer cutting blade. Detail work (mustache and beard trimming) requires more work than it should  - the design of the comb attachment doesn&#x27;t adjust to the changing curves of your face while in use, leading to uneven trimming length. A trimmer shouldn&#x27;t leave you with a beard that looks untrimmed!  I like the quality of the main unit and the price. In general, I like Panasonic products. However, there are a number of design issues with this unit, which is why I just purchased another one (Braun Cruzer6). The big issues for me are: 1) the uneven trimming length, leaving a beard that looks unkempt and a mustache that needs further trimming by hand. The design of the comb attachment makes it impossible to trim your mustache, as the blade simply isn&#x27;t at the right angle or distance for the job, regardless of the settings, 2) the quality of the detail trimmer is far below that of the main blade, causing more work than it&#x27;s worth. The cheap quality of the comb attachment is inexcusable for a name-brand item. I like the unit, but due to some inherent design problems, this isn&#x27;t a long-term solution for me. I moved on to the Braun, which I will use this weekend and review shortly.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Battery is great!</li>
    <li> I will echo the comments of others on the difficulty in removing the comb attachment, and I feel that even with careful attention, at some future time the plastic attachment will break.  The clipper itself performs well and I&#x27;m pleased with the results as a beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Flimsy blades collect hair and are a nightmare to clean. Spend the money on a professional clipper.</li>
    <li> I liked this trimmer for the most part.  However, the plastic guard cracked really easily and broke in half in less than a year of use.</li>
    <li> I see some reviews mentioning that this isn&#x27;t for body grooming. I&#x27;m from a region of Earth where we men grow very large and thick beards pretty much all over the body. I regularly trim my armpits by removing the plastic guide so it gets very short and clean. For the \\&quot;other\\&quot; region, I use the plastic guide and go against the grain at 5. I&#x27;m a man, I like to flaunt my chest hair, I like to BBQ, I like to court women, and I like beer. IF I wanted to, I can either move it to \\&quot;1\\&quot; or take off the guide as I do for my armpits and simply make it look practically bald and thus awkward. My hair is very tough and it doesn&#x27;t get tangled at all. I DO take off the guide when trimming the \\&quot;base\\&quot; as I don&#x27;t think that should have any hair.     For my face, I got this in the winter as I grew a beard. It trimmed very evenly and nicely. I&#x27;ll say this, going against the grain will cut MUCH shorter than you anticipate. Just go with the grain at a high setting. Lately I&#x27;ve just been doing it against the grain without the guide and it gives me a nice stubbled look. I used to use a 1939 Gillette Tech with Treet Blue Special blades and my badger hair brush with Ingram or Speick cream because Mach III&#x27;s left me with razor bumps and tugs. This Panasonic does NOT irritate my tough as nails beard hair.    As for taking the guide on and off, WATCH DANIEL WILL-HARRIS&#x27; VIDEO REVIEW RIGHT HERE ON AMAZON. When taking it off, go to 20 and then pull it off. When putting it back on, go to 1 and push it back in place smoothly. ALWAYS oil up the blades before you use it or after a session, this is the same concept of keeping your motor oil topped off, it prevents unnecessary wear and tear. It charges an insane amount. I went to New York for two weeks and used this to trim my face to stubble nearly every day and my \\&quot;body grooming\\&quot; twice a week (try walking around in the summer heat with a bunch of hair). I never took my charger out of my bag. I&#x27;ve never tested how long it lasts but another preventative maintenance tip, don&#x27;t keep it on a charger. Charge for a day and then let it sit until you need to use it a few times. Constant charges are bad for the batteries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for just two weeks shy of a year now.  I use it to cut my hair about once every two weeks.  This morning, while using it, the plastic at the base of the comb broke, rendering the trimmer useless for anything involving the comb now.  I loved this trimmer.  It was quiet, powerful, the battery lasted for ages.  But if comb breaks, as mine just did, then it&#x27;s not very useful, is it?  I&#x27;ve never dropped it, banged it or stressed it in any way.  It just snapped from fatigue, I suppose.  Disappointing to say the least.</li>
    <li> Shute gets plugged up easily.</li>
    <li> I bought the ER224S and liked it so much I bought another for my cats (for the long haired one mainly).  If you tend to break fragile things, perhaps this one is not for you, as the removable guide seems quite thin.  The run time seems to be about a month, when using it once or twice a week.  The charger station is the worst I have ever seen, I have to recharge it in the front room cause it doesn&#x27;t fit in the bathroom socket with the medicine cabinet above it.  Very bad design on the recharger, good thing it lasts so long or I would have chucked it by now.  And the kitty is not afraid of it, in fact she loves it now, cause those knots hurt.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great beard trimmer for a low cost from Panasonic.  It will handle any any beard trimming assignment with ease and needs no additional combs.  Rechargeable and gives an hour of use with each charge.  It is a great deal.</li>
    <li> I received one of these as a gift and I liked it so much I bought another!  After about a year and a half the plastic guard broke.  Tape isn&#x27;t working well so far.  I&#x27;m pretty bummed.  Now I have to search for an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;How do I rate this?  It&#x27;s a great idea and works well.  I am even tempted to buy a 3rd one, but a critical component is too weak for the job.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, maybe it&#x27;s best to say I hate it, only because I can&#x27;t recommend that anyone buy one of these.</li>
    <li> Love it! My last clipper was a rechargeable Phillips and lasted a long time but the comb broke and I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement so I went looking and fount the Panasonic ER224S. The Panasonic cuts very good for me making me think the old Phillips was dull. I like the comb on this one. Seems a bit stronger than the Phillips and the good news for me is that you can purchase replacements for it if you need it. (Part# WER224S7398) I may purchase a few more just in case. Yes! I know that they are plastic and have a chance to break. Not a big deal to me because I like this clipper. I looked at other clippers and there combs didn&#x27;t seem as strong to me. The battery seem to hold up good for me and I love the small charger. On the ER224S, when you set the comb to the length you want, when you switch the power on, the ER224S locks the comb in place so you can&#x27;t accidentally change it while cutting your hair. Love that feature. My old Phillips would slip if you touched the wrong area. I cut my hair on the 3.5mm setting. I don&#x27;t know how the ER224S is when cutting longer hair but short hair on this clipper works very good. All in all in my opinion this is a very good clipper.</li>
    <li> Only open at Christmas and doesn&#x27;t hold a charge!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband as I was tired of his beard and mustache not being trimmed well.  Works great for his beard, is a bit big and bulky for the mustache area.  We have had it over a year now and don&#x27;t yet need a new blade, but checked prices and new blades are very reasonable.  Is absolutely waterproof as it sometimes gets used in the shower.  Cleans up easily.  Lasts quite a few days on a charge.</li>
    <li> My youngest son is happy with it</li>
    <li> Thanks, it is a good trimmer...</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:35590911]]Panasonic, so you know it&#x27;s reliable, wet/dry so you can use it in the shower and not get hair all over, one comb with many settings means you don&#x27;t need 17 attachemnts you&#x27;ll lose. Quiet, trims very evenly (and comb locks in place when you turn it on so it can&#x27;t move). WATCH VIDEO TO SEE HOW TO USE IT (because that&#x27;s the only thing, you have to hold it just right or it doesn&#x27;t cut anything at all--that&#x27;s probably a safety feature, and it&#x27;s not going to ever gouge you, but I&#x27;ll show you how and save you time.</li>
    <li> doen&#x27;t trim well.  hair stuck, cutter is not sharp enough.  battery is horrible, last 3 min w/full charge.  cann&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s panasonic brand.</li>
    <li> Great for trimming beard, body and head. Works in the sink or the shower. Great price! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this machine for around 1 month and it works just great. The only thing is that you have to oil it before and after each use which seems a little inconvenient. Overall, it&#x27;s very good to get a nice good trim. I haven&#x27;t tried washing the blades in running water yet.</li>
    <li> I was given a beard trimmer for Christmas with all sort of attachments. However, it was a terrible trimmer and was constantly catching my beard hairs, but that&#x27;s for another review. The point is I needed a trimmer that was more powerful and didn&#x27;t catch my facial hairs as the one I had gotten for Christmas did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After quite a lot of on-line research I came across the Panasonic ER224. It looked great from the pictures and reviews, and since I&#x27;ve had good luck with Panasonic in the past, I decided to go ahead and buy it. I bought it from Amazon for only $32 with shipping and had it a few days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually only shave once a week, but I&#x27;ll still trim my goatee and mustache as needed to keep it looking well groomed. By the time I had received this trimmer, I was in need! The first thing that struck me was it was much larger than I had expected. The pictures certainly don&#x27;t do it justice. Then I realized that this trimmer is actually designed to be used as a trimmer for both facial and top of the head hair. I have used it on my own facial hair, and then used it on my 2 yr. old son&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The entire trimmer is washable. However, you must regularly oil it to keep it in good working order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. There are 14 separate length adjustments, even though the dial will show the max numbered length is 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Very sturdy and well built trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. When on, the trimmer adjustment is locked down, and takes a great amount of force to push the trimmer guard down. If you are able to push the guard down, it immediately turns off the trimmer. Excellent safety feature, for your hair that is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The trimmer guard is removable, and beneath it is a smaller trimmer that can be extended to be activated and is to be used to help get at those smaller and hard to reach areas, like under the nose, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Relatively quiet operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Quick charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The smaller trimmer beneath the trimmer guard works, but is slightly better than the one located on my electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyday Use Experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve said I used this trimmer right away on my goatee and was very impressed. It didn&#x27;t catch any of my hairs once and that&#x27;s very important to me! The guard was larger than I expected, but works great, and that&#x27;s all that matters. The trimmer comes with a small tube of oil and a hair brush, which I thought was helpful. I also was impressed that it was washable, however, the brush thus far has been adequate. Especially since it&#x27;s no problem to remove the guard. After just a few passes with the trimmer, my goatee looked great. That is a good thing about having such a large guard, you only need to go over your beard a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I used it on my son&#x27;s head. His hair was growing over his ears and my wife was at work. So I sat him in the bathtub, turned the dial to a 5 and began... Then I left my wife a message telling her what I&#x27;d done. She came home, and the first words out of her mouth was, \\&quot;What have you done???\\&quot; However, I thought it went great. Granted his head was all one length, and maybe a little shorter than I was expecting... But besides all that, the trimmer itself worked flawlessly! I was able to trim his hair and again no snags or pulling. He was quite content to let me use it on him as it is a rather quiet trimmer anyways. I have not used the trimmer on my own head because I&#x27;m not that daring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a great facial hair trimmer, or any other body part trimmer for that matter, then I highly recommend you buy this trimmer. Again, I have not used it on my own head, so I can only attest that the trimmer works great on my son&#x27;s head, but don&#x27;t ask my wife... However, that had nothing to do with the trimmer itself, just my ability to use it and choose the correct length, but that&#x27;s a different story.</li>
    <li> The plastic &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; that covers the cutter head is poorly designed and readily breaks rendering the trimmer useless.</li>
    <li> The product is really worth buying, easy to work with. The only problem i face was, it may pull the hair causing pain while directly using without the outer comb.   Overall it is good to have thing</li>
    <li> As a former owner of Norelco and Wahl trimmers, I did my research before buying a new beard trimmer, and I think that the Panasonics  are the best reasonably priced trimmers available today.  This one is a great choice and a good balance between features and price (it&#x27;s cheaper at Target than here). The best things about this trimmer is that it&#x27;s cordless, very adjustable, there&#x27;s a mini trimmer for detail &amp; touch-up work, it&#x27;s quiet, and it goes for a for a long time on a charge.  It does take a little time to get used to though.    Definitely worth a look.</li>
    <li> I would probably like this trimmer more if I knew I was using it correctly. The instruction manual sucks (technical term). It does not tell you how to remove the comb -- I just have to yank it off. The pictures are wonderful miniatures!    It&#x27;s too soon to know about longevity.    Pros -- it looks good!</li>
    <li> wonderful product.  does what it says it will....reasonable price....help up well for a couple months now.  would buy again.</li>
    <li> Used for about 5 months now. Simple to operate and cuts/trims beard fine. I have had no issues using it.</li>
    <li> I had the previous version of this, and loved that it was so easy to set the depth without different combs, and rechargeable; however the battery no longer holds charge. Replacement battery seemed almost as expensive than a new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new version has NiMH battery (not LiOn which I&#x27;d have preferred, but better than NiCad of the previous version). It sounds like it runs faster/freer/better than the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, all the same great features, at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I knocked off a star is the charging connection. It comes with a goofy angled plug-base which best I can describe allows you to turn your outlet into a wall-mount for your trimmer! Can&#x27;t plug anything else in at the same time, and in my case, can&#x27;t open the medicine cabinet with the trimmer stood up in front of it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d far rather have had a cord and plug. I ended up using a short extension cord which plugs onto the back of it, but still has 3ft cable on the vanity to the outlet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s powerful and easy to use but just when you want to take off the trimming head, it&#x27;s pretty tricky to get it off and not easy. Other than this, Panasonic has been making great stuff here.</li>
    <li> may be an outstanding beard trimmer, but I wanted an outstanding goat trimmer.  It is not that!</li>
    <li> Pros:  1) Rechargeable  2) wet and dry  3) adjustable guard  4) cordless    Cons:  1) Slow charge  2) Blade is not full width of head  3) guard adjust doesnt seem to lock adjustments very well    This is a great little trimmer if you want to use while wet.  i liked the fact that it was cordless so you wont have any cord to tangle when your trimming the back of your head or other locations.  Easy to clean, you can just flush it under running water. The built in adjustable guard means that you can adjust the length of hair without taking the guard off.  However the locking mechanism doesnt seem very strong for the adjustments. if you push too hard on the guard, it will lower the cut length.  Charge time seems to be a little long, 16 hours for a full charge!  This is of those great all in one packages. theres only two pieces, charger and the trimmer. great for short trips if you need to trim all the time with out lugging around a large set.</li>
    <li> Several other posters stated that there is a breakable part in the comb.  Mine lasted about a year before I broke that part.  Otherwise it worked well wet or dry, charged without hassle, and wasn&#x27;t too much of a hassle to clean.  The battery seemed to be getting slightly tired at the end.  I will probably purchase this same item and just treat it as a consumable good.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product when it worked, but there was a major default , which was the charger. I lost the charger, and it was absolutely useless and buying a new charger was going to cost me as much as buying a new trimmer, so I got rid of the product altogether.</li>
    <li> This trimmer throw the hair everywhere. And cleaning it is very difficult, the hair will be stuck inside the blade.</li>
    <li> The trimmer itself is great, the settings allow for the best selection of trims.  I am on my third one and totally agree with the reviewer who stated that the plastic piece is flimsy, as each of mine has broken.  I switched to another device but wasn&#x27;t as pleased.  Too bad the ER224S is so flimsy as the main body of the shaver would work much longer.</li>
    <li> The ER224S has been in use for about a year now. It works as advertised. I enjoy the versatility of its cordless design and the various trim settings. The settings, however, do not translate into what my barber understands: for example, a \\&quot;1\\&quot; isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;size 1 clipper\\&quot;, and the settings skip numbers, for example: there&#x27;s a 5, then a dot, then 8. The manual provides a chart with the actual measurements in fractions of a inch, but I&#x27;m more of the hands-on type of guy. I have used this on my mustache/beard as well as my head. I can usually get a pretty decent cut (I like it close, a but longer than crew-cut) by myself, though I usually ask my wife to help me with the back for a more even final result. I have not used it in other body parts as advertised, nor have I used it in the shower or used it under running water. Like what other reviewers have mentioned, the fact that it \\&quot;locks\\&quot; the trim length, once you set it and turn it on, is a plus. The one inconvenience is that the comb attachment has broken (brittle plastic), so I&#x27;ve had to order replacements. With shipping/handling and taxes, two attachments came close to $10. That&#x27;s less than a quick haircut at the local barber. I just hope they don&#x27;t break as easily as the first one. In short, the ability to cut my own hair has saved me an incredible amount of time, and the trimmer has paid for itself within a month.</li>
    <li> every thing is good and worked great   the charger is realy good with out any wires and stuff we can directly plug it</li>
    <li> Product is fantastic except for one HUGE flaw. The comb attachment is made of very soft plastic that will break after about 2 months. It happened to me and it happened to a friend of mine.   Once that happened there&#x27;s absolutely no way you can get a replacement part. Panasonic says that the part is back ordered and they don&#x27;t know when it will become available again. Also, this part is not covered by the warranty since it&#x27;s a consumable part.   Well yes. It&#x27;s extremely \\&quot;consumable\\&quot; and once it&#x27;s been consumed you are stuck with nothing more than a zero length shaving machine.    Keep in mind my bearded friends, unless you don&#x27;t mind ending up with massive,Zizi Top beards this product is not worth even the low price it&#x27;s going for.</li>
    <li> I bought this two years and a half ago, and it worked fine - until the (very flimsy, as another reviewer pointed out) plastic blade guard broke.  In addition, the battery will no longer hold a charge.  As I only use the trimmer about every two weeks, this means it lasted about 125 uses.  If the blade guard were made just a little better, this would be a much better product - as it is, it now needs to be replaced.</li>
    <li> Very good - glad it&#x27;s an &#x27;all in one&#x27;</li>
    <li> it was working well for first charge, then when i recharge it for the second time it didnt work any more. i went to the pansonic agent and they told sorry  there is no map for this item to fix it.</li>
    <li> After first trying a Wahl model (http://www.amazon.com/Wahl-9906-2001-Mustache-Cordless-Operated/dp/B000I1TNBS/) that I had to return, I bought this trimmer instead.  I have been very happy with it.  It would be perfect if it used AAA batteries but other than that I find it almost faultless.  It has a dial with lots of settings for trimming at various levels of closeness, has a tapered shape that feels good in the hand, runs for quite a while on a single charge, and is easy to clean.  One minor inconvenience is that to use the pop-up detail trimmer requires you to take off the silver-colored ribbed blade guard, but unlike some reviewers I found that easy to do.    The popular video review by Daniel Will-Harris points out that it can be confusing at first glance as to which side of the blade guard you should press against your face while trimming.  The key is this: the guard has only one flat side, and that&#x27;s the side you press against your face.  When the dial is set for the closest trim its even more obvious.    Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver Nov. 2011 and have NOT broken the comb attachment. Allow me to explain how I do it.&lt;br /&gt;To remove the comb attachment:&lt;br /&gt;1. Turn the dial to 20. See? It&#x27;s practically off already.&lt;br /&gt;2. Hold shaver in your right hand hand with right thumb at the bottom right of the comb attachment. Push up with your thumb while gently holding the comb attachment with your left hand and pulling up and guiding with left hand.&lt;br /&gt;3. Easy peasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To replace the comb attachment:&lt;br /&gt;1. Turn the dial to 1.&lt;br /&gt;2. Slide the comb attachment on. It&#x27;s almost on already at this point. Only about 1/8-inch to go.&lt;br /&gt;3. Gently press down until it snaps into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying another trimmer because the battery isn&#x27;t holding a charge for very long anymore and it&#x27;ll just be a matter of time until it dies. The old comb attachment appears to be interchangeable with the new one so I&#x27;ve got a spare now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my instructions aren&#x27;t clear enough, let me know and I&#x27;ll try to improve them.</li>
    <li> I replaced an older Norelco with this one. I like it better. Easy to adjust and offers an even shave. Also easy to clean. The only possible negative is the charger mounts on the electric plug. No big deal, except when need the space and must lift off the whole unit. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> After a long search, I bought Panasonic ER224S Trimmer to replace my old broken trimmer. The reasons I bought this one: 1) the Trimmer looks nice in the pictures, 2) It has good reviews, 3) It is rechargeable and 4) It is a Panasonic (a reliable company). Since I just shave once a week, I though it was a good product to try.    The Trimmer arrived in a nice and safe package. My first impression as soon as it arrives was that it is far from being a Panasonic.  Goods:  1) It is light and relatively small. Perfect for traveling.  2) It is pretty silent and recharges quickly.  3) It works for both beard/mustache and head.  4) It is washable and easy to clean (oil and brush are provided).    Bads:   1) It looks cheap-plastic made (it is terrible).   2) The trimmer combo is hard to remove(it looks like its gonna break if you try harder).  3) The height adjustment system looks loose and it seems it is gonna change the height of the trimmer combo when you use it. Although it did not do this so far.  4) The instruction manual is almost useless, with small letters and it is hard to follow. I would like to check if the manual explain how to remove the combo, for example, and just couldn&#x27;t.    In conclusion, It has a good cost/benefit ratio. However, I would not recommend this product for every day use.</li>
    <li> Pros:  Quiet operation  Wet/dry  Easy to adjust.  Adjustment is locked during operation.  Cuts well.  All in one operation.  Don&#x27;t have to mess around with separate combs.    Cons:  No overcharge protection.  The unit doesn&#x27;t go into trickle charge mode when fully charged.  This is a huge negative!  Hair gets clogged in the comb very often.  I have to remove the comb frequently to unclog it.  The plastic used for the comb feels very fragile.  This will eventually break.  Charging base is a bit bulky.  It doesn&#x27;t have prongs that retract or fold.    For the price, this is a good trimmer.  I would have given it a higher rating if the unit had overcharge protection.  You need to make sure you do not keep the unit on the charging base too long or it will die prematurely.  It&#x27;s 2014, all electronics with rechargeable battery should have overcharge protection.  This is plain old cost cutting/planned obsolescence.  Come on Panasonic...</li>
    <li> OKay - So here is my take on the Panasonic beard Trimmer: I have a full beard and when the weather gets warm I need to crop it closer to my face.  OVERALL I RECCOMEND IT !    The price is really good for this trimmer; I compare it to my brother&#x27;s Norelco which is more money, he paid about 100 bucks or more.      The Panasonic is much quieter when using ( big plus), and I have to say for me that&#x27;s a plus because I find loud humming noises super-annoying.      The trimming settings on the Panasonic are pretty good(not excellent), good selection, although a bit misleading because there is a jump in length size from one number length setting to another, for instance you will go from the number 11 length to 14 and between the 11 and 14 is another setting indicated by a dot, no number, so there is no inbetween number between 11-14.  This may not seem relevant to other men depending on your trimming needs, but for me its important since I now wear a beard year-round.    The Cut -- the quality of cut is good ( not very good, or excellent) but good enough to be well groomed and use every other day for maintaining a well groomed look for those guys out there that want to sport a beard and dont realize you need to trim your beard regularly to look sharp, otherwise you look bummy without trimming it. BUT You&#x27;ll need to run it through your beard several times to get all the hairs cut evenly.     Okay so overall in terms of quality cut it almost as good as the more expensive Norelco. I only paid about 25 dolars for it from Amazon so I really got alot of value for my money -- I am still considering upgraing to a better trimmer but for now this one form Panasonic is pretty good for the price - actually when you consider the price its excellent -- go get one!!</li>
    <li> Used for 1.5 months, and the plastic clipper guard broke!  This renders the clippers basically useless. From reading other reviews, it turns out that this is a common problem.  I called Panasonic, and they stated that this is NOT covered by their product warranty (?!?!).  They recommended I buy a replacement.  BUYER BEWARE</li>
    <li> I used this to cut my hair every other week for two years.  About that time I dropped it and the comb part broke.  It was still usable but by that time the battery couldn&#x27;t hold a charge as well, so I replaced with the same model.</li>
    <li> I have not had this long but to the present I have no complaints.  It seems to be of good construction.  It does not pull hairs.  Easy to adjust to different lengths,  Oiling is no problem.  Cleans up easily.  Does not seem to clog up. .</li>
    <li> This thing worked alright for the first year or so, but now I can&#x27;t count on the battery to last long enough (especially if it&#x27;s just been sitting around for a few weeks since the last charge), and the plastic guard broke (now completely unsalvageable after multiple super-glue fixes) even with being careful during attaching/detaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and invest in a corded trimmer or one with a lithium-ion battery that won&#x27;t crap out in a short order of time.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this product. Few parts, All in one design, rechargeable, even a simple recharger/stand made for high hopes. Unfortunately, I was quickly disappointed. Trying to cut hair with this is frustrating. The clip continually collects your hair, requiring you to remove it and tap it to try to get the hair out. A normal 15min buzz took 30min+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought I had finally found the perfect clippers but will sadly be returning them asap.</li>
    <li> It works really well and is quite reliable. It is a solid design, and is fairly quiet when working -- which is a plus. Panasonic makes some good shavers/trimmers really and this one is no different.</li>
    <li> Will buy again. I trim hair and beard constantly with this trimmer. Works nicely. Lube blade every other use foe good results. Like i said 2nd I have bought, satisfied. Advice- rinse guard- do not tap trimmer on sink bowl, guard will crack in same area ( weak spot). Guard broke again bc I did not follow my own advice. RINSE the guard!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great razor but needs constant lube.  Shave daily and holds a one week charge for me.  I like it and recommend to guys who like to keep a beard in shape.</li>
    <li> Buzzer batter is only good for about 10 minutes before it totally dies. I am usually rushed when buzzing my head to prevent needing a recharge with only half my head buzzed, and end up missing some spots more often than not.</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair. This does everything and recharges just fine. For the price I think it is an excellent value.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works although longer hair easily jams it (about every 5-7 seconds  of continuous trim).    As all longer hair is inside the \\&quot;comb attachment\\&quot; (CA) or the plastic guard, one needs to frequently take the CA off, take out the hair and put the CA back. It requires certain force to do that every time but that same force is often enough to break the flimsy marvel of poor engineering. Mine got broken after 5 uses on the longer hair (1.5-2.5 inches). A call to Panasonic led to a discussion with a tense sales guys Jack who has revealed that I need to buy this item from them. Have not bought yet, as \\&quot;other people have that in their database\\&quot;.    Short hair (1/4 inch) is OK.    In the complex world of hair trimmers a comb attachment often separates a good product from a poor one. And vice versa.</li>
    <li> Kinda slow, good batery life... I would try another model next time</li>
    <li> Does not reach top half of mustache, under nose, because of length of guide comb. Goes from a \\&quot;5\\&quot; to a \\&quot;3\\&quot;, so if you want beard to be \\&quot;4\\&quot; it will be too long, or too short. Other than that it is good. I just don&#x27;t like to have to have a beard trimmer, and then a mustache trimmer- wasted money.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Nice tight trim.  I agree with other users, cover plastic is weak and probably break easily.</li>
    <li> Panasonic quality, enough said!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second ER224S... I enjoyed using my first one for two years until I dropped it in the shower and the guard broke, rendering it useless. The rest of the trimmer was unscathed after the drop, however- a testament to its durability. I&#x27;m not sure why, but I replaced it with a Norelco vacuum model (39.99), enticed by its upscale features. There were too many moving parts which felt easily breakable, it was extremely loud from the vacuum (seriously, it could wake the entire house with no exaggeration), and was not waterproof making it a pain to clean.     The Panasonic, on the other hand, is a solid, simple design. Everything you need to keep your beard trim is right there, and there are no accessory blades to add or remove or inevitably lose. The blades are sharp, smooth, and very quiet. It feels solid in your hands, and gives an excellent trim. My beard is kept very low, and this does the job with ease.     Because it&#x27;s waterproof, just rinse it off when you&#x27;re done. Be sure to oil the blade once a week to keep it running perfectly, but that&#x27;s the extent of any maintenance this thing needs. Another plus: a wall-dock style charger... The trimmer charges on the outlet, making travel easy (no cords to worry about), and keeping the shaver handy at all times in the bathroom. An excellent, well-rounded product.</li>
    <li> Does the job very well, less expensive than most, has great range of adjustment in 1 mm. increments, and the comb is replaceable - at least 2 vendors on Amazon have them for about $5 apiece.  The comb attachment is a weak point in the design that will eventually fail, as other reviewers have pointed out, but the original one on my last ER224 lasted 7 years.  Anyway, it is worthwhile to get a couple of spares.  One star off because the charger design makes this version cordless only.  My old ER224, which is still usable, can be operated cordless or corded so it still runs corded after the non-replaceable batteries inevitable died after a few years.</li>
    <li> $18.90 w/FREE shipping*?!  Are you serious?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 24 and I&#x27;ve been to your cheap SuperCuts and Master Cuts all the way to your expensive $20 hair cut whole shabang barbers that you find in the hood that take 45 minutes for a cut.  I feel like I can do what the pro&#x27;s do with these clippers/trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used my dads version of these clippers/trimmer for a few months already then liked it so much that I decided to buy my own set.  The difference between mine and his is that his doesn&#x27;t come with a wall charging base like mine and instead has a corded wall adapter.  The newly designed unit with charging base is a lot more convenient and space-saving; check out the picture I attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw some posts complaining about the included trimmer under the guard and I ask myself what their problem is.  The trimmer is sharp and strong enough to give you a razor sharp line up all around including your mustache and goatee.  It&#x27;s WAY BETTER (sharper and stronger) than those trimmers that come with the Wahl or Con Air clipper packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers itself are nice.  They&#x27;re built great and nice and light.  Like the trimmer, they&#x27;re stronger and sharper than those Wahl (Chrome, etc.) and Con Air clipper sets you can find on Amazon and Wal-Mart for about $40+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these clippers/trimmers so much I&#x27;m considering buying an extra set just in case they discontinue it.  Buy them now and don&#x27;t look back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Free shipping if you buy other stuff along with this that total more than $25 like I did.</li>
    <li> Had two and the adjustable measuring guard broke in the same place in just over a year on both. Fooled me once - I should have never bought another one.</li>
    <li> This is a disappointment because the plastic comb device broke in the first week of use.  It is hard to remove to get to the small trimmer underneath the guide.  When it came off, the end piece of plastic snapped.  I suppose I could have super glued it, but I felt that it would be better to call Panasonic to replace it.  They refused to replace it as a defective piece.  They said I would have to pay for it.  I said that I would rather send it back to Amazon.com and that I would write a bad review about their product if they didn&#x27;t send another plastic part.  They refused to stand behind their product, so I am telling everyone now that this is a piece of garbage and if Panasonic customer service is this bad, I will never buy another of their product of any kind again.  The designer of this product has the IQ of plankton.[[ASIN:B000F4USF8 Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Cordless Hair and Beard Trimmer (Silver)]]</li>
    <li> The product worked well, by the build quality is not up to par.  The plastic guard broke after less than a year of use, and the trimmer can&#x27;t be used without it.  The product was not mistreated, and was never dropped.  This is a build / design issue, and the part is just not strong enough for ongoing normal use.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for a couple of months and it works great.  I especially like the feature that prevents the cutting height adjustment from changing while the motor is running.  It is quiet, comfortable, and produces consistent results.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I agree with other reviewers that it is a bit of a pain to access the detail trimmer.  I would have preferred a pop-up detail trimmer rather than one that necessitates removing the main blade guard.  Nonetheless, I would buy another one of these if I ever needed a replacement... or a gift.</li>
    <li> great shaver my boyfriend loves it. the settings are taking a bit to get use to though</li>
    <li> I bought two of these and both times the comb attachment broke! When I called Panasonic to get a replacement attachment, they wanted to charge me more than I paid for the clipper! When I told them that the clipper was only 2 months old, they told me that I still had to pay for the attachment and the shipping! I know that I am not the only person to have this problem and I will never buy another Panasonic grooming product! This attachment is super flimsy and made to break and the clipper is absolutely worthless without it. I have never broken a comb attachment in my life and I have been cutting my own hair for 30 years. My next clipper will be a quality clipper from a quality company, instead of a piece of junk with even worse customer service!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t open to use this item yet. It is ok for cut general hair everyday.</li>
    <li> Works well but are to bulking for accurate trimming!</li>
    <li> Trimmer works great but the plastic guard needs to be re-engineered.  See from my and others&#x27; experience that the design is too fragile.  Lasted 6 mos.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews for this one with users griping about the guard being frail- and I can&#x27;t argue with it. It&#x27;s a little flimsy. Especially when you have to remove it for the fine trimmer which is located under the guard...not sure why. But it&#x27;s not that bad. Really, if you&#x27;re not a total hulk that has to rip everything apart, or not someone who throws their clippers around, this should not just work fine but wonderfully. The clippers themselves cut extremely well and the adjustable guard is amazing. No more stupid removable guards that get lost. Plus...and I have no idea how, the battery holds an amazing charge. It took forever for me to have to recharge this thing. It trims my beard, my neck, all areas of my body I want &#x27;scaped and does so well. Plus, it&#x27;s not expensive. If you can take care of your toys, buy this one. If you find that everything you lay your hands on breaks...move along...and keep your hands off my stuff.</li>
    <li> this shaver sucks..wont hold a charge after a few months and does not shave down very short for facial hair and it hurts.&lt;br /&gt;recommend going a different route</li>
    <li> I needed something to replace an older clipper, it had to have a smallish trimmer for the beard and be cordless.  This model fits both needs and works as described in the manual.   No complaints so far.  Unlike others mine takes and holds a charge for an acceptable amount of time.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. He mentioned that he was very happy with how much precision the razor has. He can both shave and trim easier than any other razor before. Great razor.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Trims very well.  Not afraid it will gnash my face like some trimmers. Charges well and keeps charge for a long time (for now). Don&#x27;t like that I have to pull the plastic-sizer to get to the detail-trimmer.</li>
    <li> When my wife broke my former beard trimmer I attempted to find a replacement at various local stores and was sadly disappointed at the lack of selection.  Amazon offered the best selection and this product caught my eye mainly because Panasonic is a brand I trust.  Having used the item for several weeks I&#x27;m adjusting to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Holds a charge and offers MANY trim settings!&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Recharging base is bulky, the blade angle requires adjustment when operating without the trim guard and removing the trim guard is somewhat challenging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all the trimmer works great and I&#x27;m hoping will prove to live up to Panasonic&#x27;s reputation for longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit worked great, but the plastic piece that adjusts cracked and recently broke...which makes the shaver unusable.  Too bad Panasonic doesn&#x27;t offer a replacement piece.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the trimmer for about one month and so far I am pleased.  The comb is flimsy, but other than that I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. Works as advertised. Sharp blades, powerful quiet motor. My only drawback on it is the attachment is kind of difficult to remove and put back on...and I normally wouldn&#x27;t be removing it too often, but the way it is made (unlike my last one), you have to remove the attachment quite often when cutting hair with it because the hair wont just fall or shake out like you would like-therefore you find yourself tussling with removing and putting the attachment back on to get the hair out. After you get used to that aspect of it, it is a very good product.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic trimmer product is a wet/dry trimmer which impressed me as my earlier trimmer was a no water trimmer. I wanted a trimmer which equals a close shave. Though it does not reach my expectations its still a good trimmer. I would give it a 4 out of 5 rating.</li>
    <li> Love it. Able to give the perfect shave. Its weak point is the battery - though it does last 4 or 5 shaves. This is a classic - works well clipping hair as well as trimming a beard, etc. Excellent quality. Has lasted years.</li>
    <li> I just got this last couple days and I couldn&#x27;t wait to give a try. The initial use was not very pleasant; the blade stuck in the middle of cutting and it HURT! In terms of the quality and the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; is totally not what I have expected from Panasonic at all. I got a Panasonic electric shaver for my X&#x27;mas and I am still very happy with it...So I guess the difference between them is quite clearly where it is made in. This model is \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; and the shaver I have got is \\&quot;made in Japan\\&quot;. So next time I will look for \\&quot;made in Japan\\&quot; for the new one!</li>
    <li> works well. would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;spaces comes off and on a bit rough.</li>
    <li> I went through four cordless trimmers (Wahl, Remington) whose guards broke during travel, blades got dull, or batteries stopped holding a charge before I found this one - and I love it!  I&#x27;ve had it for a year and a half now and use it several times a week for cutting my hair and trimming by beard.  Very thoughful design throughout.  The adjustable guard means you don&#x27;t have to pack several guards when traveling.  The blades ave stayed sharp.  The batteries easily last for several cuts.  The waterproof feature is nice for trimming in the shower.  The guard is removable for close trims.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is ok except for one huge flaw, the plastic guard is flimsy and the tines break off very easily.  I used this trimmer to buzz my head and while it did a decent job, the plastic guard quickly started losing tines and eventually the whole thing snapped in half.  You can kind of use the unit (just for buzzing) without the plastic guard but it is not very comfortable.  For most people this trimmer would be completely unusable without the plastic guard so it is a big problem.  A couple of the tines broke off mine when I tried to buzz my head while I was sweaty.  For some reason this prevented the unit from gliding like it normally does and the plastic pieces are so thin they just broke right off.  So for months I was using it with a big gaping hole in the middle of the plastic guard.  Then recently the whole guard just snapped.  I&#x27;ve only had this unit less than two years so considering the price I paid for it, I just don&#x27;t consider that a good deal.</li>
    <li> I have used this trimmer for about a month.  The charge lasts just fine. The \\&quot;dial adjustment\\&quot; for hair length is really a great feature since it is encased and prevents the possibility of the guard coming off during use.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised by this clipper- for the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but the quality, features and performance earns it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I actually quite like the clipper itself, but the comb/guard attachment is junk.  I have had the trimmer 3 weeks and while the trimmer itself is doing a great job, I have already broken the guard.  Looking through reviews more carefully now, I see that this is a pretty common occurrence.</li>
    <li> Cut hair fine first 3-4 uses, then began to pull hair out and not cut.....Settings did not seem to stay in place while shaving head. Dropped it onto the bathroom counter ( 1 ft! )and it totally fell apart...pretty flimsy item...</li>
    <li> This works great for keeping my hair trimmed.  Love the fact you don&#x27;t have multiple attachments, you just turn the dial.  Also it&#x27;s shortest setting seems to be much shorter than others with snap on attachments.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again, it&#x27;s not easy to use</li>
    <li> I have a 20 year old panasonic trimmer which is made in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy a new one after the battery died.&lt;br /&gt;My old trimmer does a much better job than this new one (which is made in China ...)&lt;br /&gt;I used the blade without the plastic adapter, and the blades get clogged with hair after a second or two, and then the blades become completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t return this item because I used it once, and amazon won&#x27;t take it back ...&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t expect them to sell it to another guy, but it kinda sucks to get a $5 refund on it ...</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer. Great settings, rechargeable, and waterproof. It works great, love it</li>
    <li> This is an okay trimmer, I actually use it for my head hair it works good, but could use finer adjustment, each increment has a little to much adjustment between.</li>
    <li> My order arrived in December 2009 and I&#x27;ve regularly used it since. The trimmer did a great job on both my face and my head until two days ago when I jinxed it by thinking to myself how well it had lasted me so far. The plastic comb attachment broke on the side and even super glue couldn&#x27;t keep it in place.     To sum it up in one sentence:    It is an excellent trimmer until it breaks.    I need a new one now.</li>
    <li> I had this trimmer for approximately 8 months and it broke at the same point indicated in the picture.  The battery life was also waning towards the end of it&#x27;s life.  I use this to shave my head so perhaps it wasn&#x27;t designed to last anymore than a few minutes but I am once again in the market for a beard/hair trimmer.  I was going to buy the plastic piece as a replacement part but hard troubles locating....</li>
    <li> This shaver looks very nice, but it does not perform as well as it looks. On average my beard stays about a 1/4\\&quot; thick not a whole lot there but this shaver still has a tuff time for me and pulls alot of hair. I also have an issue when I get to my mustache as I cannot get just under my nose because the tip of the adjuster sticks out a little to far. I also am losing power after only 2 full face shaves. I kind of wish the adjuster was easier to remove for cleaning and that it came with a bag to keep it in.</li>
    <li> Fortunately Panasonic still produces one of the last remaining clippers with a comb-lenght adjustable mechanism, in this case a wheel. At first I got frustrated in my online search finding an array of clippers that mount a number of interchangeable \\&quot; clip on \\&quot;  combs... that I knew in advance I would have lost after a few weeks of my extensive traveling. This clipper carries all the comb lengths in a single, very practical,  adjustable wheel.&lt;br /&gt;The only relevant CONS of this device is the the LACK of a DUAL VOLTAGE (110V ~ 240V) electric charger for traveling purposes... I travel extensively back and forth to and from Europe and I am forced to awkwardly  plug the charging base in an adapted 110v outlet since  it&#x27;s solely designed for the US standard outlets/voltage. Is it possible that Panasonic can have forgotten about this very important technical feature?</li>
    <li> We have had these clippers for over a year now. My husband uses this every few weeks to cut his hair at home (he&#x27;s military). It works very well. We particularly like the little blade that pops up for edging and finer cuts. My main concern is the charger base. I always feel like the base and the clippers are just too heavy to be sticking out of the socket the way it does, but so far it hasn&#x27;t fallen out of the socket. I really wish it came with a long cord so that we could keep it plugged in while using it and without having a bulky base attached to the bottom. That would make these clippers a 5 star, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Great product, does as stated. Gotta love the adjustable clip.</li>
    <li> Easy to use,even under water,easy to clean ,low maintenance,for beard,hair cut and manscape&lt;br /&gt;Content with this purchase,,,good for the money.</li>
    <li> Bought one about two years ago at Target,and it worked fine for beard trimming,the perhaps 8 or 10 times I used it.I lost the beard for 8 months and stuck the trimmer away in a drawer.When I pulled it out a couple of weeks ago(have a beard in need of trimming)the battery was dead and it wouldn&#x27;t take a charge.I tried contacting Panasonic,and they haven&#x27;t responded in any way.I guess if you like a substandard product,this is the one to buy.</li>
    <li> Right out of the box, this product felt flimsy and seemed poorly designed. Though it may not look like it in the product pictures, the comb attachment on the top of the clipper is detachable, and it has to be because the built-in trimmer is *underneath* the comb attachment. However, it is an absolute pain to get the comb attachment off, and everytime I tried to do it, I feared that I would damage the plastic because of the huge amount of resistance. The instruction manual, which is the typical horrible series of comic strips on a piece of paper folded over 47 times, depicts no other way to get the attachment off than to just yank it off. This clipper seemed like a great idea in concept, but that concept wasn&#x27;t well executed, in my opinion. It&#x27;s going back.</li>
    <li> Having used a Norelco model for years, but frustrated with how quickly the non-replaceable batteries wear out, I decided to give this Panasonic a try.  Plus, it was half the price of the comparable Norelco trimmer.  To my disappointment, the Panasonic lacks the features that made my Norelco a breeze to use.  For one thing, the comb attachment seems very flimsy, and requires a good yank to remove it.  It slides into a little notch on the trimmer, and I have some serious doubts that it&#x27;s going to last very long before breaking.  Another inconvenience is that you have to turn the trimmer off in order to adjust the comb height.  Plus, unlike the Norelco which has a built in charge meter, so that you know when the charge is complete, or when you&#x27;re about the run out of juice, the Panasonic just has a simple charge light that provides no info at all.  Finally, the Norelco&#x27;s comb attachment flexed to fit the contours of your face or head, while the Panasonic&#x27;s comb attachment is fixed.  In my opinion, the flexible attachment on the Norelco was able to provide a closer and more even cut.  All in all, maybe for a Panasonic model, this is a good trimmer; I really can&#x27;t say because I haven&#x27;t owned a Panasonic before.  But compared to the Norelco, well, there really isn&#x27;t any comparison.  Like I said, it is half the price of the Norelco, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> A couple of months and counting so far so good the blades on this trimmer stay sharp and the charge time keeps up between charges I get a good cut from this trimmer each time.</li>
    <li> I had bought this as a replacement for my old Norelco T960, which was wonderful until the battery died. I have currently gone back to the old Norelco (keeping it plugged in while grooming) until I can find a suitable replacement.    The guard and blade design of the Panasonic make it almost impossible to trim your beard or other body hair. The cutting blade is in the middle of the huge guard. Making it impossible to position the trimmer in any direction that will allow it to trim your mustache while your nose is still on your face... :)      The guard itself is so large that my slightly curly beard hair will not follow the guide to the cutting head. Trying to use this trimmer was an exercise in futility.    Might be good as a head/hair trimmer, haven&#x27;t tried it for that, but for a beard/body hair groomer it is useless to me. I think I will give it to charity.</li>
    <li> Tried a couple of non-panasonic brands and decided to come back. This one works smoothly. Can go as short as 0.04\\&quot; without a problem. A bit wider than I thought and that&#x27;s why the 4 stars.</li>
    <li> On time, good product, it does what it says, 4 star because the comb is fragile sure i will have to replace it on the future, but the combs are cheap anyway.</li>
    <li> I like it thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A.Barros</li>
    <li> Product works excellant  Great product for the price. would recommend to everybody. easy to operate and results are great and professional looking</li>
    <li> Wow i am impressed.  Yes if your hair is long you will clog the trimmer and have to remove the guide to clear. But once you get it down to highest setting you can go to town. And it works great. I like that it lockad the guide when you turn it on so no accidental mishaps can happen.  I took the sides and back down to about 7 on dial and top at 20.  Blended the area between by using different settings till i got to longest. Looks great.  Had my wife do neck line.  Now i can keep my hair looking good bi-weekly this should work great. I even  did my beard and if you like thst stuble look set it on 1 and shave now you have that after five look...for me i just finished with an electric shaver nice no pull.  I purchased two different trimmers to compare this 22 dollar model and the norelco 40 plus adjustable head. 35 dollar model.  But the panasonic did so well i just sent back the norelco.  22 bucks ....thats one haircut for me i save over 270 a year awsome never again going to barber. Buy this you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> blade guard is clunky makes this clipper useless.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this beard trimmer. It works very well, and has the necessary adjustment to trim a beard to any desired length. One cautionary note - if you push the end of the comb/guide to make sure it is seated, the trim length setting will inadvertantly be reset to a shorter setting. I almost ended up running a very short trim path through my beard.</li>
    <li> This is a nice gadget to cut body hairs. It is rechargeable and cordless trimmer, it does what it suppose to do, after all its from Panasonic so I believe it would run last long in terms of durability and blade, battery. It can be cleaned by water or brush provided in box. The setting does well to make adjustments for different size/place of hairs. Manufacturer says blade will last long close to 3 years depending of uses. Packing was really huge and good, easy to open and store, but a large box packed. The only problems I feel are:   1) its too heavy to hold and operate   2) Cleaning takes a little time. Leaves long hairs even after adjust it on shortest.  3) Charger is not for international use, it support only US (120V) and very specific to this unit only, so actually you have to have its won charger to get it work. it could have been a universal.    But overall its really nice must have trimmer.</li>
    <li> Worked rather poorly for a hair clipper. I keep my hair short (1/8 inch), The guide would fill with hair clippings and render it useless until I totally removed the guide and cleaned it out. As other reviews noted - the guide is quite flimsy. Mine didn&#x27;t get a chance to break - I threw out these clippers after just 3 uses.</li>
    <li> I really liked the product.  It was easy to use and lived up to billing.  It does not have multiple size grooming heads which are always an annoyance.  The single adjustable head on the razor works well.      The only small issue is that the design makes it a little difficult to get to the hair immediately next to the nose.  This is a small annoyance and I would recommend this device without a doubt.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace an ancient Wahl plug in trimmer. {that still works}  Does everything I need it to and it&#x27;s cordless..</li>
    <li> The design of the plastic guard creates weak spots where the material is thin. It broke. Not good. Looking at it after it broke, the bad design becomes very obvious.</li>
    <li> I have an amazingly thick beard and this by far the best trimmer I have ever used. No pulling at all. It took me a fraction of the time it usually does to trim my beard.</li>
    <li> I have a corded Wahl hair trimmer for 10+ years.  I thought corded trimmer will always be superior compared to cordless ones, boy was I wrong.  First thing I did when I got the new cordless Panasonic trimmer was test it for myself didn&#x27;t even bother charging and started trimming right out of the box. Worked flawlessly without hiccups.  Since the Panasonic is cordless I would think it to be less powerful and more reruns trimming but this was not the case.  It trimmed with precision and cut closer then my Wahl when using the closest attachment setting \\&quot;number 1\\&quot;.  The Panasonic feels solid and has a well balanced weight to it not heavy duty feeling like my Wahl.  The reason I went ahead with this purchase is because I will be traveling soon and didn&#x27;t want to lug the a corded trimmer plus attachments and accessories around the world.  This is solid product and exactly what I was looking for.  Amazon did not lag on shipping either.  I highly recommend this product.    7-28-2011   Change my opinion of this product the adjustable plastic frame for cutting it closer or longer broke off after using it for 6 months.  I tried glue it back together but just fell apart again after a few uses.  It was great while it lasted.</li>
    <li> my hair grows faster than this clipper will cut it.  I have very little hair to begin with, these clipper bogs down, have to make 3 or more passes to get a semi-clean cut.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer for the purpose of maintaining a short stubble look.  For this, it works wonderfully.  The setting wheel goes all the way down to 1 mm.  After reading the positive reviews on Amazon, I ended up buying it at Target for $30.  Have not regretted the purchase.</li>
    <li> The bulbous design really does make this trimmer easier to hold and use, and I *love* that it is submersible so I can bring it into the shower with me to shave and clean it (instead of getting a &#x27;vacuum&#x27; trimmer which many people have complained about).  I do need to be careful about making sure that it is on the right setting before turning it on, though.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT body trimmer! But it&#x27;s fragile &amp; the battery sucks. I roasted the first one by dropping it. The second one had a very short battery life. I tried to get other products but this trimmer is so good I feel like I&#x27;m paying $20 to rent it for a couplea years before it craps out &amp; I get another one. I use it to trim my sideburns and everywhere else I can reach.</li>
    <li> This is the third trimmer I have purchased and by far the best. It has more settings than any trimmer I&#x27;ve seen. I also like the charger a lot. I did find it a little difficult to clean as the guard doesn&#x27;t come off as far as I can tell.</li>
    <li> One adjustable attachment does it all. Works week</li>
    <li> I purchased this beard trimmer ~ 2 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did a decent job of trimming my beard, though I wish it it&#x27;s lower (closer shave) settings were a little finer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately though the Li-ion battery&#x27;s longevity left a lot to be desired. obviously any Li-ion battery is going to be limited to a certain number of charge/discharge cycles (and capacity will degrade over time), but it just seemed like this puppy&#x27;s life was inordinately bad....within 6 months I noticed a difference. I&#x27;d much rather pay 20% more for a quality battery, yes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse than that though, now the unit won&#x27;t function even when it&#x27;s plugged in. Really disappointing...</li>
    <li> Cuts my beard hair and doesn&#x27;t come alive to try to kill me.  So that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> This thing works OK, but takes all day to charge and lasts only 15 minutes till needs recharging. does not seem to fully charge</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer!  My husband uses it for his hair and beard and we actually cut my son&#x27;s (he&#x27;s almost 2) hair with it as well.</li>
    <li> Useless for buzz cuts, waste of money.</li>
    <li> the best all- in -one hair clipper of all time. water proof also.</li>
    <li> Works like a champ!  Takes care of my facial hair as well as head hair (clean shave look).</li>
    <li> The only reason im writing this review is because of all the negative reviews i read. I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for at least 3 years now and its still going strong. Battery holds charge, blades still sharp and guard works as it should. A note about the blades, i do clean them and oil them a couple times a year, that helps alot. Mine came with a charging cord not like the wall charger i saw in one of the pics. I&#x27;d recommend this trimmer in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> The Head piece keeps braking, and I need to glue it since I can&#x27;t find a replacement. Also its too bulky to trim your mustash . its just not built well.</li>
    <li> A very nice trimmer !</li>
    <li> Worst product I have bought for a while. Sure, 20 bucks is not much. So I guess you cannot expect much. These looked good at first. Seemed very efficient and versatile compared to my 20 something piece set. However, I found a lot of issues with them. For one, the teeth on the guard are too thick and too close together. Making it nearly impossible for the hair to get to the clippers. Next, the clipper blade is not parallel to the guard! I have no idea who designed that, but the blade should be parallel to the surface of the skin. And therefore the guard should be parallel to both. The guard also has teeth that cover both sides. Forming a cage that traps the hair. The guard must be removed ever few seconds. Which makes it feel like it is going to break. And it resets it&#x27;s number setting. Which is another thing. It uses an odd number system. What would normally be a, say #4, is a number 11! So if you set it to 4, you will be bald! You also cannot remove the blade. Removing the blade is necessary. For cleaning the components of hair, skin, and oil debris, as well as for sharpening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my hair twice a month or so. After reading many good reviews on here I thought this was worth a shot. 20 bucks is not a lot of money. But that is $20 I am down, that could have went towards other things. Cheers.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about an year. There were no problems and it still works like new with regular oiling. The battery life is good. There is nothing to complaint and I bet the owners love it.</li>
    <li> Just got a few hours ago and it works great. This is the first beard trimmer I&#x27;ve used, and it worked wonderfully. It was easy to use and adjust the lengths as well. I definitely recommend it, especially for the great price.</li>
    <li> Practible and proper for home-use - not for professional employement.  8-hour charging time allow about 45-min continuous operation.  Blades allow precise trimming.</li>
    <li> Trims evenly. Multiple settings are an advantage. This is my third Panasonic trimmer in 5 years.  Better to get a new one when either battery stops holding a charge or trimmer blade starts cutting unevenly because of the parts cost.</li>
    <li> Works better dry than wet for me, but still a solid purchase!</li>
    <li> I needed a second cordless trimmer for another home and was surprised that this model was still being made. I went ahead and purchased it as I had been so pleased with the original one I had purchased...especially as the price remains so reasonable. It looks exactly the same and works as well as the original and so far I have been very satisfied with it...however I do feel that the quality of the plastic is not quite as strong as the original and feel that I have to be very careful not to break any of the tines on the new one. For that reason it only gets 4 stars..whereas the original would get the full 5 star vote.</li>
    <li> Great clipper,  highly recommended</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t recommend it for cutting a full head of hair. Ideal for trimming. Does not cut hair very well and the problem with cutting full head of hair with it is that the hair builds up very quickly in the plastic guard and then it&#x27;s a pain to remove the hair. It just doesn&#x27;t cut hair very well; you have to press down firmly and go over same spot multiple times. Again, can&#x27;t recommend this for cutting full head of hair, just for trimming.</li>
    <li> good product for the price and does the job.  Easy to clean and nice weight. Would buy it again</li>
    <li> IM IN LOVE WITH MY NEW TRIMMER, I havent cut my hair yet because its short right now, but i tryed it on my beard and it was great,</li>
    <li> I have had my trimmer for two years now and I believe for the cost ($20 from Amazon (with S/H) - it&#x27;s by far the best in the market!    For all who have commented about the comb attachment breaking; go to [...] to order a new comb (comb part number is: WER224S7398).  The Comb will actually cost you less than the S/H charge.  New Comb costs $1.45 each (as of Jun 15, 2012) - I recently ordered 2 new ones - delivery took less than one week (to Georgia).    New Addition: Amazon wouldn&#x27;t allow me to write-in the entire web site address above, go to: [..]</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as if I bout it in the store... nothing wrong with it, it works and serves it&#x27;s purpose like a charm...</li>
    <li> Good price and good product</li>
    <li> Great product would recommend and buy again.  Light, efficient, easy to use, well designed.  Does the job it was intended to do.</li>
    <li> If you look at the items description that there is no mention of the docking station which is great but, when you look at the customer attached pictures you&#x60;ll see that there is a pic with a docking station to charge the item. Since this is not an expensive item I did not read the description in detail and ordered the item and was suprise to see there is no docking station. I like the item however; not happy due to fact that the same item have a docking station .</li>
    <li> the wife and i bought this to replace a small battery powered trimmer that we shared for \\&quot;bodyscaping\\&quot;...i used it for the first time yesterday and loved it...wife used it and said it is just too large for her to use...i will be keeping it for a couple reasons, first the old one we had ate up batteries so i love that this will hold a charge, second i love all of the settings which allows a lot of versatility in cut length...the product is made well and looks good too</li>
    <li> Great seller and a great price</li>
    <li> I liked this product very much while it worked.  However, the plastic guard is VERY flimsy.  It broke after about 20-25 uses.  I can&#x27;t find a replacement part, so the product is now non-functional.  I am VERY careful &amp; gentle with my things, and this is totally rare for me.  In my opinion, this is a design failure.  Very unfortunate, because if that part held up, I would like the product very well.  A shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I uploaded a photo, with red circles around the breaks, at the top of the page, under the main product pic, so you can see.</li>
    <li> This is an OK machine for awhile but the flimsy head broke about 8 months after I bought it. I tried to super glue a repair but that didn&#x27;t work. I have sent three emails to customer service for Panasonic and each promises me an answer in 48 hours. I have been waiting for a month now. Lots of other just-as-good machines at this price that will last a lot longer with less aggravation. Skip this one.</li>
    <li> The plastic guard/adjustment attachment is poorly designed. Cheap flimsy, POS. Broke on me just taking it off to clean. Worked when new. Didn&#x27;t last a month. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS Product. You have been warned. I am normally somewhat of a fan of Panasonic products.</li>
    <li> Refer to RW&#x27;s pictures at the top.  Panasonic needs to lose some points on the style of this thing to reinforce those weak spots.  My guard broke on the second use, leaving me with a nice bald spot.  I would have sent it back to the manufacturer for a warranty repair but considering it was a design flaw and not just a bad one I couldn&#x27;t possibly have trusted the replacement.  I just went ahead and ordered a nice Wahl one instead, with those replaceable comb guards.</li>
    <li> I brought this product are carefully weighing it&#x27;s cost, advertised functionality, and customer reviews. Although I have only had it for several weeks, I am quite pleased with its performance. I like how many settings are available, its easy-clean design, and general ease of use. My only issue that the length of the razor guard means you have to use the trim the whiskers under your nose with the included (and attached) smaller trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have had same problem like others that the plastic breaks after a few weeks... will buy Remington againg, no more Panasonic for sure</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair clipper, but the comb attachment will break for sure. I have purchased 2 of these units in the past 18 months and in both occasions the comb attachments have broken. The last one only lasted 6 months...    Update--07/13/11   I called Panasonic and they do offer a replacement comb attachment. Call Panasonic at 1800-833-9626--Part # WER224S7398. Price $1.45..plus shipping of $5.95..You can order up to 5 with the same SHP/HANDL fee of $5.95...</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great until the plastic guard breaks, then it&#x27;s useliss.  I even tryed gluing it, but it did not work.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the guard broke after maybe 15-20 uses. Cleaning it often required moving the guard, and it shattered upon removal.     But even before that happened, the razor never really followed the contours of my face very well and left a lot of curlier beard hairs outlying. Definitely do not recommend.</li>
    <li> 4/1/11: I just called Panasonic warranty to verify whether or not the comb falls under the warranty, since numerous people have complained that the comb breaks easily and that Panasonic does not honor a warranty on it.  I was told by someone in the Phillipines that the comb is not warrantied, \\&quot;because it is a replaceable part.\\&quot;    However, the warranty on this product is now allegedly 2 years, so you will now have 2 years during which the broken comb will not be warrantied.</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble keeping my beard trimmed to the longer length that I like it at. This great waterproof trimmer cuts my beard perfect every time. I plan to use this trimmer for years to come. It is one of the best things I have ever purchased to improve my overall looks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I got it. It&#x27;s light, looks nice and works well.  And the smaller head on the backside really makes a difference when you&#x27;re trying to trim your mustache, etc.</li>
    <li> My old Wahl trimmer was not working right so I purchased this item based on all the positive reviews. What a disappointment! Hair gets caught very quickly in the comb and I have to keep removing the comb to empty the hair. It also periodically catches hair causing my partner to wince. Not good for a trimmer. Even using it corded it was not powerful enough and needed several passes to get a decent cut. We have been cutting each others hair for over 15 years (and saving lots of money in the process). This hair trimmer is one of the worst ones we have bought. I am going to look for another Wahl and will return this product if I can.</li>
    <li> VERDICT:    Good trimmer that is worthly of the Panasonic name, but keep the receipt just in case you don&#x27;t like the design.     PROS:    - Quiet  - Sharp blades  - Light weight  - Versatile Wet/Dry design  - Excellent battery life (holds a charge for weeks at a time)  - Compact design  - Single height adjustment (no need for multiple attachments)  - Reasonable price    CONS:    - Mini trimmer involves removing plastic beard height attachment  - Beard height attachment removal procedure must be performed a specific way to prevent damage  - Does not groom all hair at consistent height on shortest setting on my face    SUMMARY:    I&#x27;ve purchased two of these trimmers over the past few years. One stays home and the other is for travel. I can recommend this trimmer, but it does take some time to get familiar with how to manipulate it for a consistent trim. I&#x27;ve only used it on my anchor beard and some body hair. It works fine for both. Use a light touch with this trimmer. If the height adjustment piece is removed, be warned that you will eventually get cut if trimming a very contoured part of your face or body. The mini trimmer behind the main trimmer is nice for ear and nose hair, but don&#x27;t press too hard or it will cut into your skin. It&#x27;s nice to know that it is a Wet/Dry design (no need to worry about shocks or rust,) but I prefer Dry and can&#x27;t comment on Wet performance. Keeping the blades lubricated once a month to maintain sharpness will easily double the life of the blades and improve overall performance.     ATTACHMENT REMOVAL PROCEDURE:    Extend the attachment by turning the adjustment wheel to the highest numerical setting. Grab the corner of the attachment that is directly above the plastic adjustment slider that moves horizontally when the dial is turned. In the same motion, pull up on the corner while pulling the attachment away from the trimmer.    ATTACHMENT REINSTALLATION PROCEDURE:    Turn the adjustment wheel to the lowest numerical setting. Replacethe attachment by aligning it with the trimmer and slide back until you reach the horizontal adjustment slider. With a quick motion, push the attachment into the horizontal slider. It will click into place without harm to the trimmer.</li>
    <li> This trimmer runs smooth and cuts affortlessly. Has easy to use adjustments and panasonics often last long time. great buy!!</li>
    <li> It is now 2009 and still using this unit... A GREAT BUY... It is now December 2010 STILL GOING! GREAT BUY -- TODAY October 30, 2011 Still working -- Todays date December 15, 2012 - Still working and nothing has broken yet...    Head BUZZ -- I like the feel of the shaved head but HATE doing it everyday. So Back to the BUZZ... Started about 10 years ago and have been using a corded trimmer at my sink. After a shower I clean up the mess at the sink and floor. I have been looking for a clipper that would BUZZ my head in the shower. Vedial Sassoon (sp) made one some time ago that was water proof (wet/dry) and it has been off the market for a few years now. I looked at other wet/dry tools but found nothing that would work for me. I bought this one and LOVE LOVE it...    I use the shortest setting - sometimes I use #2 setting if I feel like a bit more hair. I BUZZ my head every Monday AM in the shower. I do not use it wet while the shower is on as it states that it is water resistant and not a true Wet/Dry unit. After I get done I clean it in the shower stream (while off)and place it in a holder that I purchased - after I shower I dry it and let it set for a few days then I plug it back in and use it again on Monday.    This is a perfect item for me. Been using it for a few months and so far it does what I need it to do. I like the built in adjustable slider, it locks in place when you turn it on and DOES NOT SLIP. My corded trimmer has replaceable spacers and they have fallen off after a few months... Have to be careful, but this one is in place and will not move.    The head is a bit narrower than my Wahl Electric Clippers; Considering the convince of being in the shower and cordless makes it a great buy. I would purchase this item again.    Waiting to see now how long it last. Now 2010 December --- Still going GREAT BUY!!! It is now October 30 2011 Still working and no problems at all, again... GREAT BUY Glad to see it is still on the market today    ***** February 2015***********   Been using this for many years now, (still working) but I think I have something new and different, some of you might want to check this out... Used it twice now and like the way it cuts.

    <li> There has been a great deal said about this trimmer in quite a number of reviews, so I won&#x27;t go into great detail. I&#x27;ve had my ER224 for 5-1/2 years and wouldn&#x27;t consider using another product. I use it every week on my hair, and a couple of times a week on my beard and mustache. All parts are original, including the blade and comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after more than 800 uses a piece of the comb broke. I have no idea how I did it, but there has been a great deal written about how fragile this part it. Not that fragile for me. I have no idea why the blade has held up this long without replacement either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Checking Panasonic parts, the comb appears to be under 1.50, and the blade under 20.00. At under 25.00 here, I&#x27;ll buy a new unit. It&#x27;s a steal as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Don&#x27;t forget, for me, I was able to retire my barber as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;m curious about if someone can help me. My ER224 (Not a ER224 S) has a separate corded plug in power supply. I prefer that arrangement to the ER224 solid plug in. Does anyone know if the base of the newer ER224 S will accept the plug from the corded charger I have ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks. Don&#x27;t think twice about buying this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer it&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Adjustable portion is flimsy.</li>
    <li> This is the second trimmer of this model.  The first was given to me used and this one I purchased because it does such a great job with my chin beard.  I like to keep the beard very short and the minimum adjustment fits the bill.  The trimmer is light and fits the hand well.</li>
    <li> I ended up with screwing my head badly and had to go to hairdresser.  The comb is too soft and you will cut uneven, plus cutting performance is very poor. Returned it.</li>
    <li> Only had this a few weeks but so far it works fairly well. Seems like good value for the money. Can be a little hard to use in certain areas but overall it works well. Don&#x27;t know how long it will hold up since its plastic.</li>
    <li> dont buy piece of junk barly shaves anything dont waste your money or beard. have better luck picking hair with twessers.  and thats a fact so please dont buy</li>
    <li> This is a must for every home that want to save on expenses.  I had to get a second one for stand-by.  it is special because wet or dry wash cause no harm to it.Quite durable too.</li>
    <li> Fell off counter and shattered</li>
    <li> Got this for myself.  It&#x27;s mainly for trimming my out of control side burn like the last days before hair cut.  The quality is very nice, and it can be used wet or dry.  I love the fact that you can have different length set.  The only complain is that it has yet another charger and different from other ones from Panasonic... can&#x27;t the companies have a more universal approach when it comes to chargers???</li>
    <li> I shave maybe once a week, sometimes more, but I mostly like letting my beard grow out. The first full charge lasted 3 months. When it finally comes time to trim my &#x27;stache, I usually detail and edge it quite precise and this trimmer does an excellent job of that. A strong motor is everything to a fine trim and it is certainly not lacking in this department. I&#x27;ve read about the comb attachment&#x27;s tendency to break and I can definitely see how that can happen. I&#x27;ve been very careful removing it and thus far haven&#x27;t had an issue.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  Bought it for my husband and he is picky about quality.  We would highly purchase this item as a gift for family.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> If you want a clipper that will break while trimming your beard and cause you to accidentally shave off half your beard, then this is the right one for you!&lt;br /&gt;I had one of these that lasted quite a while until the guard broke.  I figured it was a fluke thing and I ordered another hoping for a different outcome.  This time, after only a couple months of not-all-that-much use, the guard broke and I shaved off half my f*cking beard.&lt;br /&gt;Nope.  This thing sucks.  Do. Not. Buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this so I can get my son&#x27;s hair cut by myself.  It worked really well!  Worth each $$$.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> After searching hi and low for a good machine for my husband, he loves this one so much, we bought one for his brother too . . . he also loves it. They say it does its job without tugging and love that they can shave in the shower with it.</li>
    <li> I have used Panasonic beard trimmers continuously over the past decade.  This model, while adequate in most regards, is not the best of the lot.  First off, it is bulky, long, and heavy compared with predecessor models making it problematical as a travel trimmer; it is simply too big and heavy.  Secondly, the cutter comb is too wide and not very well designed for fine trimming.  It is also more difficult to remove the cutter comb for fine trimming as compared with previous models.  This is truly an instance when \\&quot;newer model\\&quot; does not equate with \\&quot;improvement.\\&quot;  It does hold a charge well and does an adequate, though not outstanding, trimming job.</li>
    <li> I had one of these previously and it broke eventually from pulling the top off so many times, but I had it for quite a while before it finally broke (maybe a year or two of constant use). I bought a different one after this one broke (one of the types that comes with a handful of standard length head attachments) and I soon found I missed not only the ability to dial up many more lengths with the Panasonic, but also the fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable (I hated the fact that the one I tried was not rechargeable and the cord would constantly be batting things off the sink while I was using it. Also the standard length heads weren&#x27;t always the length I wanted for either my beard or my head). So I bought another Panasonic. If it lasts a year or two then I&#x27;ll be happy enough.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and I have no complaints. Very good value.</li>
    <li> The product is very good, only problem is, is kinda hard to keep the inch number u wanted on hold, sometimes it slips and then u can damage all your hair cut.</li>
    <li> I purchased this bearm trimmer for utilizing on a frequent basis.  I had no problem with the overall quality of the item.  What I had issue with was the trimmer did not trim the hair as closely as stipulated.  I like to keep a very close trim, it leaves the hair quite prickly, not as short as the Wahl I presently own and was replacing.  I returned the Panasonic, now am seeking another brand.</li>
    <li> I hope this helps:    The comb on my trimmer broke exactly as pictured above, after about a year.    The good news is that replacement combs are available from Panasonic at the following adress:    [...]    The part number is: WER224S7398    The repalement combs cost about $1.50 each, and there is a $5.00 shipping charge for orders up to about ten dollars, so you may want to order more than one.    My combs arrived less thana week after I ordered them.    I haven&#x27;t taken time to read all the reviews, so I hope I&#x27;m not repeating information that has already been posted.    Happy trimming.</li>
    <li> Really like the single adjustable comb design.  Has good battery life a nice charger and just enough power to get the job done on my pretty thick head of hair.</li>
    <li> Not yet used this product but I believe itr shud be great for beards.</li>
    <li> I have not used a better trimmer!</li>
    <li> Pleased with the purchase</li>
    <li> Trimmer works very well. My only real complaint is the adjustable head feels pretty flimsy, and I&#x27;m a bit afraid it might break. But so far, after about six months, it&#x27;s been holding up.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s exact model of this hair clipper died - after about 18 years.  It&#x27;s longevity was remarkable.  While searching for a replacement, we were quite surprised to see that the exact model was still available - and at a reasonable price!  He was thrilled to receive the replacement for his birthday !</li>
    <li> I started to cut my own hair since 2 yrs ago, but suddenly my old hair cutter broke. Found this one on Amazon and it works so well. The battery lasts for hours of use.</li>
    <li> The clipper itself is a bit underpowered, but the real problem is the guard design.  It was constantly getting hair built up under the guard - so much so that I could do about 2 passes over my head, then I would have to shut it off, remove the guard and knock out the hair.  Haircut would take 15 minutes, and up to 20 minutes with my son.  Used it maybe 5 times before buying a real clipper.</li>
    <li> So far I have used this Trimmer for six months and it has done a great job with my beard.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Used it on my goatee and full beard. Used while in the shower the water did not slow it down at all.  Great product</li>
    <li> Its got all i need, its cheap and durable i would most definetly recomend it to a friend for sure</li>
    <li> The exterior is cheap and made out of some flimsy plastic. The cover over the actual blades broke after low use. It&#x27;s a shame because when it was working, it worked really well.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair. I tried this 4 times &amp; the cutting power just didn&#x27;t do a clean job. Now, I&#x27;m trying to return it, but it&#x27;s too late. I&#x27;m past the 30 day window. Oh well, I guess it&#x27;s trash bound.</li>
    <li> Really good product, just be careful when taking off the guard, feels like it snaps and could break.  Other than that, long battery on a charge, cuts great and the lock for the guard when turned on is great!</li>
    <li> This what I wanted, I deal with the best of cause its a Panasonic product always the best and it will always be the best</li>
    <li> works well, holds a charge quite awhile</li>
    <li> Can not trim my mustache all the way to the nose.</li>
    <li> No more hair stylists for me. This unit by Panasonic is all I need. If you have just a little knowledge of the skull, that&#x27;s about it. That&#x27;s all ya need.</li>
    <li> It works okay, but I was disappointed I can&#x27;t use it (or at least I haven&#x27;t figured out how to use it) for a very close buzz cut. I also don&#x27;t like the fact that when you charge it, the charging light does not change color, so you don&#x27;t know when it is fully charged.</li>
    <li> I had this for almost two years, and it was decent but not great. It cut hair okay. My kids didn&#x27;t like it because it would catch on theirs, but I didn&#x27;t notice anything more painful than most when cutting my hair. The guard is a little large which made it hard to do some beard trimming in areas around my face specifically the chin area even at a low setting. It was nice to have so many lengths to choose from, but ultimately like other reviewers have pointed out, the guard is to flimsy and broke for me. Once the guard breaks its basically useless to have it lying around. It was worth it when it worked, but I wonder how much more I could have paid for something that would last longer.</li>
    <li> Works Fine as expected.</li>
    <li> Perfect all in one... I am very pleased with the brand.  I had an older set that I used all the time to trim with and finally broke the guard off and the charger cord was warn out so instead of buying the new parts for almost the same price I purchased the newest one which comes with a nifty wall adapter cradle charger no cords to deal with anymore!!!  I am very happy with the quality as my other set lasted for years and I was disappointed when I dropped it and the guard broke into peaces.</li>
    <li> I bought this primarily as a beard trimmer.  I have a corded trimmer that I use for cutting my hair.  When I saw that this could also cut hair, I thought I might be able to use it do both functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a the beard trimmer, it works well.  It&#x27;s not too aggressive in the cutting department--and that&#x27;s good for me.  I like to keep my beard a little longer than the guides, so not being too aggressive allows me a lot of control.  Sure, I might have to go over an area several times to get it where I want it, but, for me, that&#x27;s a safety feature.  It&#x27;s small enough to get my mustache and around the ears.  The guides work well for trimming up my side burns to match the hair cut of about 1/2&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I decided to try it on my hair, I found a pretty major issue.  If you cut any appreciable length of hair off in a pass, it just gets caught in the guide and doesn&#x27;t fall away. The guide completely encloses the blade.  So the hair just get&#x27;s stuck in the guide and you have to remove the guide to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several reviewers have stated that the guide length adjustment would change while cutting.  Apparently, that issue has been fixed.  When you turn on the clipper, the guide is now locked.  So, you have to turn it off to change the length.  I discovered this while feathering my side burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are looking for a good beard trimmer, this will work great.  If you think you can use it for beard and hair, my experience was that it would not be good for that.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair trimmer after watching Daniel&#x27;s amusing review.  I have to say it works great.  I can cut my son&#x27;s super thick head of hair with it, with no problems- providing I do hold it in the way that Daniel had suggested.  I also take the guard off and use it shave my head. It gets pretty close.  Not as close as my corded Wahl balding clippers, but much more convenient since I don&#x27;t have an outlet yet in our bathroom.  The only gripe I have, is one that has been previously stated by others:  The charging light never turns to green.  Most rechargeable things have a light that changes colors to let you know when it&#x27;s done.  This only stays red.  Kinda odd.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s cordless and compact but hair get&#x27;s trapped, and I always had to remove the guard to clean in, which finally led to it breaking after only a couple months.  Most trimmers allow you to shake off hair or it falls off naturally, this shaver traps it in.  Terrible design!</li>
    <li> I use it about once per week in the shower to shave my head.  It has worked great for the last 6 months.  Rechargeable and easy to clean. I would buy one again.</li>
    <li> I like this trimmer!  But I have to buy one every 3 years because the battery wears out and won&#x27;t charge.  The battery is not replaceable.  So I have a pile of these old trimmers in a drawer.  I know that&#x27;s what Panasonic wants me to do.  I should find a better trimmer that is more reliable, but that would mean starting from scratch.</li>
    <li> Very nice; and easy to use.  I had a big corded clipper before it quit working. This is all you need. I trim my hair and beard quickly with ease.</li>
    <li> Love it.. Works perfect!</li>
    <li> Works great, great price</li>
    <li> I think it is an all around good tool just think my boyfriend would have liked a straight up trimmer better instead of one that cuts hair too.  He is too afraid to cut his own (or let me do it) or the kids&#x27; hair with it and prefers to spend money on a professional.  But that is just him.  I think it works just fine.</li>
    <li> My second one the first one lasted oh 15 year&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Ok so I am buying this AGAIN!! This is my 3rd one so far.  The clip has broken in half 2 times so I have 2 trimmers, one for each bathroom.  Now I will have 3!! LOL There should be a warranty though.</li>
    <li> It works better as a dry clipper than when wet which is the complete opposite of my experience with panasonic wet/dry products.  being a battery clipper it cuts slowly but faster than my old rechargeable anyway so I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> it very good by it made in china</li>
    <li> The trimmer has been working well and is easy to use.  I like the fact that it has both a corded and cordless feature.  My only critism is that I feel that the instructions could on maintenance could have been written in a little more detail.</li>
    <li> The features I like are that it is ergonomic and easy to handle and change settings. Also I like the option of operating it with or without the cord (to conserve battery life when you can). The only addition I would like would be a convenient drop-in charging platform which would ease the hassle of charging. Overall highly recommended.</li>
    <li> thought it would be great because the attachments would never get lost but it fell and the hair length ajustment piece broke. also its a pain having to charge it and losing the cord all the time. battery life is low and its not  powerful at all. if you shave your head all the time i would get a set of pro clippers for more money. its worth it . they cut faster and cleaner like the barber shop.</li>
    <li> Would use this seller again.  Great experience.  The item is great as well!</li>
    <li> I used to dread trimming my goatee. The last couple of trimmers I had would catch hairs and pull them (very painful). This one doesn&#x27;t do that. That alone makes it the best trimmer I have ever used.    Pros  Cuts without snagging hairs  Easy to adjust depth settings  The size of the guard looks misleading, this can give a very close trim  Easy to clean  Charger plugs into the wall and the trimmer sets right on it  Can use in the shower (wet/dry)  Since it doesn&#x27;t snag my hairs, my last trim took 15 seconds!    Cons  The detail trimmer comes straight out of the top, so I have to hold it perpendicular to my face to trim my mustache. Still getting used to this.  I almost feel like I am going to break the guard when taking it off to use the detail trimmer.</li>
    <li> I received the Trimmer promptly.  It works wells and gives a close stubble cut.  It also works well around the neck and ears.  I was a little disappointed with the guard which is actually a bit sharp and will gouge your face and neck if you use firm pressure.  Taking the guard off is difficult since it is light plastic and just snaps in place.  I&#x27;m afraid if I am not careful it will break.</li>
    <li> My first review.    I like it. great price for me.  good battery life. waterpproof.  easy to recharge.  quiet.  improve the comb for easier to clean hair cuttings.  I hope this thing lasts a long time Amended review.  This cheap plastic comb to trim where ever is simply  poorly designed junky plastic adjustable junk. It breaks because the corner combs are thin and the plastic is unforgiving junk.  Mine has broken multiple times, tried to repair with super glue, plastic cement, and lastly with epoxy.  I&#x27;m spending as much to repair this junky piece as to buy a new one... I can&#x27;t get a break.  Otherwise...I like the hair clipper...the beard trimmer part is just junk.  Improve the product.  End of story...for now.</li>
    <li> Husband decided I could cut his hair in a burr, so we bought this and I actually was able to make him look as good as when he goes to the barber shop, and he was pleased.  Reasonably priced,...so pretty good value....about the same price as his normal haircut.  I will get a lot better on the next try!</li>
    <li> does the job &lt;br /&gt;somewhat awkward design.....took a while to figure out which was cutting surface &lt;br /&gt;cutting length dial must be carefully used......easy to slip back to minimum length which could cause a disaster.</li>
    <li> Oil blade before first use. Have to use extension cord to charge if charging base is loose in socket to prevent from falling out of socket and possible damage to clippers.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this trimmmer, but I do have one bit of advice for potenitial purchasers.  Before using, you must check that the face guard is in the proper position for the desired setting.  It does tend to fluctuate on mine, and does not always line up properly when replacing after cleaning.  Last week&#x27;s setting #2 might line up to this week&#x27;s setting #5 if you are not carefull when replacing the face guard.  Other than that, no other complaints and no other problems.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the same product  (about 6 years old) and which had developed a battery problem -- it would only run when connected to 110VAC. The battery on this guy is not  replaceable.  But at this price, who cares?</li>
    <li> Just like another reviewer on this site my trimmer guide has broken in the exact same poistion.  How do I get a replacement???</li>
    <li> just for only 0n week</li>
    <li> A handle would be nice, but other than that, this is very good for general purpose manscaping. The comb locks when the motor is on, so no mishaps. Included oil to lubricate the blades. Nice. Cleans up easy. Wet/dry functional. Really good price compared to the rest of the options.   The charger is a little wonky  - no cord, just plugs in to the wall and the base of the shaver. Not sure why they did that.</li>
    <li> There is an obvious design flaw with this clipper. When you rotate the guard dial and raise the guard, it doesn&#x27;t lock into place. This means that when you apply pressure to your head/beard at that level, the guard simply drops to its lowest setting. It&#x27;s completely useless as a multi-level clipper. I guess it could be used if you only ever wanted one length of hair: 0 guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> Perfect! Really Great Product!</li>
    <li> crap....adjustment for height would not stay in place when using it to trim....useless!!</li>
    <li> Bought a few plastic replacement heads.  Recommend if you buy one order a few heads with the order because they crack&lt;br /&gt;often.  The shipping cost more than the plastic head/comb. The battery didn&#x27;t last that long less than a year approx. No receipt&lt;br /&gt;no warrantee period. It&#x27;s very easy to use which is a big plus</li>
    <li> The plastic cover that adjust the clipper size broke and there is no replacement part available. I called panasonic, and they said there is nothing they can do.</li>
    <li> Too big to trim under my nose.</li>
    <li> I like it very helpful and convenient setting the level for hair cutting.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and clean. It feels good in the hand and is well built. It works exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Panasonic does it yet once again!  They have the best personal grooming gear out there.</li>
    <li> my second one, they are great for beards.</li>
    <li> This product worked fine until the guard broke.  So I found a replacement part on amazon, purchased it for $5 plus shipping, and used it for two months, and that guard broke.  Same spot.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as I expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried it on a relatively long beard. It did not work at all.</li>
    <li> It works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;better than my expect ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it really safe to cut hair by my self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah</li>
    <li> this product is not worth purchasing for beard trimming. it does not cut evenly. The plastic clips bend causing an uneven trim. This product is costs too much when you can buy something equivalent for a lesser price.</li>
    <li> this is a great trimmer at a great price and WOW does it work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took it out of the box and tried thinning my sideburns. Don&#x27;t be misled by the size of the trimmer - it manages a very fine trim at the 1 setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This model ok.. Dont expect too much from this. Its not giving the clean trim for Beard compared to LG basic trimmer. You can use this as a hair trimmer for sometime that too not very impressive. Unable to unpulg or replug the adjuster frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any other option go fot this otherwise please dont..</li>
    <li> I have a short haircuit (not by choice if you get my meaning :-), so after a week or two after getting my haircut at the local shop (close to the sides and back and long in the front), my hair starts to get bushy on the sides and I just want to trim it down myself to get a cleaner look and at the same time delay another visit to the haircut place.  I have gone through many self hair cutting trimmers and so far this one is the best.  Granted I haven&#x27;t used the FLOW VEE yet (do they still have those around anymore?), however I have gone through several other trimmers that didn&#x27;t last as long or just didn&#x27;t give me that clean cut (with or without the built in guards).  I still prefer those trimmers like this one with the built in / adjustable guards due to convenience.  This unit has good power and cuts nice and clean.  It cuts evenly on both sides for a person like myself that has no idea how to cut hair.  Just be careful when shaking the unit to get the cut hard out. I have had the unfortunate experience of shaking it up against the sink and not realizing that I reset the adjustment back to Zero, so when I proceeded to trim my hair again, it carved out a massive, uneven patch of hair, which tooks me a couple of week&#x27;s to grow back while experiencing some unusual looks.  Overall this is a solid, convenient hair trimmer for those like myself that have no idea how to cut hair, but can use this tool to clean up a bit in th meantime and also delay the next visit to the hair cut place.</li>
    <li> I travel A LOT for work, and I needed a shaver that was low-profile and could handle it all. I stay in hotel rooms and off in the wilderness as well and this shaver has been a great tool for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this unimpressive looking shaver in a pinch at Target thinking I might use it every now and then. It turns out it&#x27;s all I ever use. The charger is small and doesn&#x27;t involve cumbersome cords or a pointlessly large base. It is great in a shower, on all parts of the body, and holds a charge for a remarkable amount of time. I&#x27;m not uber-precise when it comes to my beard length, but if you are, there are like 17 settings plus a detail trimmer. Also, you can take the guard off if you really want to go to town on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At only around 25-30 bucks this razor outperforms any electric razor I&#x27;ve owned in both durability, portability, and performance. I have thick facial hair and I&#x27;ve never encountered any snagging issues. TSA stole my last one and I bought another without hesitation right away.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this shaver, until it broke. As has happened to others, the guard broke within 6 months of first use.  In my case, the guard split at the bottom through the thickest part of the guide.  I was extra careful with the unit based on other revieww: no drops, no abuse, no forcing things, just a weekly trimming of my beard for 6 months. Dang.</li>
    <li> *update* I bought this trimmer a second time in Jan 2012. I&#x27;m downgrading my rating from 5 to 3. The (new) guard broke after I had it for just 1 year &amp; 1 month. I don&#x27;t think it ever got dropped or anything, just broke using it on my face. I can still use mine because I saved the original guard from the one I got six years ago and it&#x27;s still not broken yet (it was the motor that finally started sounding funny on the old one). Deliberate or not, the result is planned obsolescence because the new guard is more flimsy than the old one (quality of the plastic since they look identical). Buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Panasonic trimmer in 2006 after both Norelco and Wahl rechargeable batteries gave out after barely a year. I&#x27;ve had good luck with Panasonic products. Yesterday it started making kind of a funny noise and wasn&#x27;t cutting very well, so I decided it was time to replace it. That&#x27;s way more durable and reliable than most of the competition. The rechargeable battery still holds a reasonable charge for at least a few trims if I travel which makes the battery 500% or 600% better performance than Norelco and Wahl.  I paid 39.99 for this in 2006 and it now sells for considerably less today, and I notice most of the \\&quot;broken guard\\&quot; reviews are from 2010 and 2011, so it&#x27;s possible they&#x27;ve cut corners and cut quality the last couple years. OK, I&#x27;ll buy this one again and save the guard from my old shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer worked well for me, I usually trim my beard with the \\&quot;8\\&quot; setting (I have a pair of scissors I&#x27;ve always used when I want to trim my mustache.) I was frankly surprised to find I can buy the exact same trimmer model again six years later, because most companies are constantly dropping a good product so you never know what you&#x27;ll get next time and have to spend the time to do comparison shopping all over again. It&#x27;s a solid product and only looks a bit scuffed after over five years of use and it got dropped more than a few times. Attention to the little things too - with most products like this the words and writing are wearing off within a year or two, but not with this trimmer. And yes, the one I bought in 2006 was made in China, not Japan. I could see how the guard could break, but in general it&#x27;s a very well-made product (or at least it was in 2006).</li>
    <li> Panasonic is my absolute favorite company of all time. They make so many unique and really well thought-out products, such as wet/dry shavers, TVs, really durable computers. You name it, they have it.  This trimmer is no exception and the only thing I don&#x27;t care for about this trimmer is the battery that is included with it. It definitely does not stand up to the test of time and requires a complete and somewhat difficult replacement to keep enjoying it again.  But the price can&#x27;t be beat. If you look in stores, you can&#x27;t find this specific model any longer. I like the fact that you can clean it under running water and let it dry. Charge time is not bad, especially for a quick 5 minute or less trim. So a great job.  My first Panasonic Shavers were made in Japan and you can see a DRAMATIC difference in the quality from that shaver to this current model.  All in all, Panasonic does a great job of making high quality products that are indeed &#x27;Ideas for life&#x27;.</li>
    <li> hi i just got this  4 my husband 4 valentines day  output electricity plugfrom here but im wondering if its going 2 b an amarican or on australian</li>
    <li> I bought this hair trimmer about 2 years ago and I am not disappointed. It is good quality product and cut my hair weekly and so far the  battery is still good.</li>
    <li> The Trimmer Comb Attachment is very easy to break. I bought it for my husband as a bday gift. We both watched the video clip of one of the reviews of how to attach the comb gently. My husband follow the instruction completely but after a month of use it broke. What a piece of junk. I hope they can improve the durability of the comb attachment.</li>
    <li> I bought this for beard trimming and now I also cut my hair with it. This was on sale, and much cheaper than trimmers in local stores. It works better than I expected. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I wish there was a little more versitility but it works great</li>
    <li> Four buzz cuts so far and works very well. Better than the Remington it replaced. Like other reviewers have written, the comb attachment is not easy to remove and does seem it could be easily broken if you&#x27;re not careful when removing it. Otherwise it&#x27;s a solid product. Also be sure to charge for the full sixteen hours before first use.</li>
    <li> I love that you don&#x27;t have to change out sizes; the dial works very well. Cleaning it out is a pain though!! Hair gets stuck inside and is extremely tough to get out after using. Overall, a very good value for the price paid (you get what you pay for). Product description is pretty accurate - I got what I expected. I also really like that&#x27;s it&#x27;s cordless and charges easily. I recommend to buy it if you won&#x27;t need to use it frequently, don&#x27;t mind taking extra time to clean it out, and want a good value that is Prime eligible.</li>
    <li> Love the wide range of lengths you can cut to. The only downside to this product is that you have to take the adjustable comb off to access the small trimmer. Otherwise a great product!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying a new beard trimmer, &amp; it seems that most of the Panasonic beard trimmer&#x27;s are the best one&#x27;s available today instead of the usual names such as Norelco, Wahl or Remington. This particular model seemed to be the best choice based not only for it&#x27;s features but the price was reasonable too. The best things about this trimmer is that it&#x27;s cordless, there are MANY settings for the beard length, there&#x27;s a mini trimmer for detail &amp; touch-up work, it&#x27;s quiet, &amp; the charge holds for a long time---I&#x27;ve had this trimmer about a month &amp; it&#x27;s still going on only 1 charge! The drawbacks are that the blades (except the mini trimmer) aren&#x27;t very sharp, you can only adjust the settings when it&#x27;s off, there is more maintenance required than some trimmers require, &amp; you have to be careful when removing &amp; attaching the beard comb. I would say it&#x27;s worth checking out, but it definitely takes a few good uses to get used to it.</li>
    <li> Several years ago I purchased a Panasonic C282 trimmer which, at the time, was the only cordless hair trimmer I could find.  I had to get it from Canada as it wasn&#x27;t marketed in the US.  I wanted a cordless because I found it cumbersome using a corded trimmer to do my own hair.  I just bought the ER224S as my C282 recently broke after I carelessly dropped it.  I just used the new trimmer and have to say, I feel pretty good about it...  Since my old trimmer had broken, my hair was much longer than usual and the new trimmer had no problem going through it, as some other reviews suggested.  I did have to stop a couple of times and remove the comb to clear out the built up hair, but that won&#x27;t be a problem if you keep your hair short.  The old trimmer had a smaller comb and it was easier to flick the cut hair out of it without having to remove it but this seems minor unless you are often cutting long hair, which I do not.  That is the only slight knock I can give the new trimmer compared to the old one.  Otherwise the motor seems stronger and quieter on the newer one.  The larger comb and cutting head is easier to hold and I like the adjustment knob better than the slider on the old trimmer.  Despite some reviews it does not seem easy to accidentally change settings in use as it seems to lock down the setting once the power is on.  The old trimmer could occasionally slip settings during use, though it wasn&#x27;t too bad - the new trimmer seems to improve on that as well.  The setting numbering seems odd as they have 1, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17  and 20, with half step settings between each position.  The 2 setting is roughly equivalent to the 2 setting on my old trimmer and the 5 seems to be about what the old trimmer&#x27;s 3 was so I don&#x27;t understand why they didn&#x27;t just number them sequentially.  I personally do not like traditional corded trimmers with separate attachments for each length.  I had a Conair trimmer for a while and just didn&#x27;t like it.  It is much more convenient todial in my desired cutting length instead of having to switch out different combs for each length step.  Cutting without the cord is much easier as well, obviously.  So I am very happy with this trimmer so far and would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** Update about 10 years later!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using this trimmer since 2007!  It is a great trimmer and I just purchased it again because the original one finally died outright.  Not bad I say for 10 years.  So my experience with this trimmer has revealed two things to look out for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, as some reviews have mentioned, the plastic comb can break.  If you drop the trimmer, the comb will probably break depending on how it lands.  I have only dropped my trimmer once in 10 years so unless you are a klutz, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a big issue.  However, if you take the comb off incorrectly it can also break.  The comb clips in on one side but the other side kind of free floats a bit.  If you pull from the free floating side and are not careful, you can can cause it to crack.  I have found if I only pull on the connected side and do so with firm but careful pressure, it comes off easily without breaking so this isn&#x27;t really an issue either.  Also replacement combs are relatively cheap I keep an extra one or two just in case but haven&#x27;t had to replace them very often at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other issue,  also mentioned in a bunch of reviews, is that the battery in the trimmer does not last forever.  Shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise, rechargeable batteries only have about a 2-3 year expected life in general.  Should Panasonic have made it easier to replace the battery?  Sure, but I don&#x27;t put too much of a knock on this trimmer because of it.  If you want, you can get a replacement battery if you search.  And while not very easy, it is possible to replace the battery.  My experience was that the battery lasted a decently long 5-7 years.  I don&#x27;t remember exactly when it stopped taking a full charge but I did use it forthe last 3-4 years as mostly a corded trimmer and it was still a good experience.  However, just this past week it stopped turning on at all.  It appeared to be fully charged, but wouldn&#x27;t turn on even while corded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I looked at a bunch of different trimmers but realized for the price, under $30 now, it is such a great trimmer that I decided to just go ahead and order it again.  The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this model now is that it came with only the stand charger and not the cord.  So when the battery does go you can&#x27;t use it as a corded trimmer.  For me that&#x27;s not an issue because I saved my cord from the first one and it still fits the new one.  Anyway, a great trimmer.  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco AccuTrim Beard and Moustache Trimmer T765 for a little over a year before I lost the charger. After looking for one both in town (San Diego) and on the Internet, I decided to just buy a new trimmer all together. At this point, I began to do some research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally, I looked exclusively at Norelco trimmers though my rational was solely based on name recognition. After reading many reviews and comparing prices, I decided to look at other brands as well. That is when I came across the Panasonic ER224S. The reviews for this product were overall excellent, and the price was appealing as well: only 5 dollars more than my old Norelco when bought at Best Buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before we proceed, I should let you know that I am more of a beard growing enthusiast than a beard growing professional. While I have been growing a beard for about a year now, I don&#x27;t now, nor have I ever had aspirations to have a ZZ Top caliber beard. With that said, for my needs, this beard trimmer does everything I could hope for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer improves over my old Norelco in so many ways. The adjustment setter has 14 settings for a beard length up to 20 mm over the 9 setting my old Norelco offered, and the setting becomes locked once you power the trimmer on. There is an additional detail trimmer that offers the flexibility that my old Norelco could never offer, and it hides away when you aren&#x27;t using it. The ER224S also allows you to operate the trimmer while it&#x27;s charging. This was something that drove me nuts concerning my old Norelco. It&#x27;s just as quiet as any other trimmer out there and in my opinion, it&#x27;s the best looking trimmer you can buy. It simply looks classy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a built-in vacuum, but I really don&#x27;t see that as necessary. From what I have read, they most often break or the performance is sub-standard. In the grand scheme of things, how difficult is it to rinse out the sink after you are done? The trimmer is also rather easy to clean. And the manual was very thorough explaining the ins and outs of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, the only con I can think of for this product is the rather large charger. However, I trim my beard 2-3 times a week, and the charge seems to keep for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.thorough explaining the ins and outs of the trimmer.

    <li> Great clipper for both beard and hair (on your head, that is!).  It&#x27;s a few dollars more than some of the competitions&#x27; models, yet well worth the (slight) extra expense in terms of build quality and ease of adjustment.  One nice feature is that when the trimmer is running, an internal mechanism prevents you from inadvertently changing the length setting.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE SECOND ONE I HAVE OWNED. THE ORIGINAL WHICH IS IDENTICAL LASTED FOR 8 YEARS. NO  COMPLAINTS. LAST TIME I WENT TO A BARBER WAS 2004</li>
    <li> Having cut my husband&#x27;s hair with scissors for many years, we finally decided to change to clippers and go with a shorter style.  I had a corded Norelco that I loved and did a good job but I wanted a cord-free one.  I shopped and found this Panasonic ER224 and liked the idea that it was cordless and could be washed off with water.  What a disappointment!  I have tried to use it for 3 haircuts now, and have come away frustrated every time.  The hair gets stuck in the guard after just a couple of passes and I have to stop and clean it out.  It takes many passes to get all the hair the same length which means the haircut time is much longer.  I cannot see a child sitting through this process.  I will be replacing this product as soon as possible.  Thumbs down and not recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer in the world! I am a girl and I use it frecuently to do my fashion hair cuts and my boyfriend use it too... it is quiet, precisely, even if you want to shave you body you can use it or your face! you will get the best machine and you can clean it with water, it is wireless! i really recommend this product</li>
    <li> This product is a good idea, the attachment is good for really long hair, not too good for Afro American hair. The clippers don&#x27;t get that close on a fade cut. Bought it for my son to cut his own hair great starter.</li>
    <li> An awesome product!  BUT the guard broke somehow.  I didn&#x27;t bang it on the counter or throw it down to break it either.  One day, it just broke!  I got it for X-mas too:( I would like to continue to use it--but I can&#x27;t.  I tried to superglue it, and also wrapping a rubber band around it...nothing worked!  If anyone knows how to get ahold of another plastic guard--let me know!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for cutting my own hair for years. After two or three haircuts it has paid for itself. The first few times you&#x27;re a little clumsy, but after a little practice, a trim only takes a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;This clipper is perfect because you never have to change cutting combs, a new cutting length is just a dial adjustment away. I have used this trimmer for about ten years. I buy a new one every few years just to get a fresh sharp blade. I have probably given myself hundreds of haircuts and have never broken a plastic blade comb. I am at a total loss to explain the many comments about the fragility of the blade combs. It&#x27;s never happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to buy a new one about every two or three years for as long as they make these.</li>
    <li> I like this machine, I used the older version and I moved to US but it doesn&#x27;t charge here because of voltage difference. I decided to go with this one and its amazing. Water proof, easy to wash with adjustable head and a great trimmer, I use it for my beard and I get the style I want.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old Phillips Bodygroom.  Firstly I tried it out on my beard which I keep short, be careful. I set it at 2 and nearly ended my beard, A week later at a 4 setting did the trick. To those that say it can&#x27;t do corners - I say horse hockey. After beard I did sideburns, gave myself a decent hair trim and then figured heck with it let&#x27;s manscape. Upon conclusion I promptly gave away my corded Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, not Panasonics highest end but more than enough horsepower unless you&#x27;re a wookie. Oh and the dude bitching about the comb being fragile, maybe should try being reasonably gentle... tho they sell the replacement comb here on Amazon if you are unfortunately ham fisted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10 rating -2 points for comb detachability issue and overall build quality - would recommend.</li>
    <li> this is a very good product with good design and easy to use, i like it so much, I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I usually spend $20 for hair cut and every since I bought this trimmer, I haven&#x27;t been to my hair dresser and already saved 2 times the trimmer cost. It is an excellent trimmer for both beard (not too long) and for hair cut. It takes little while to find correct angle for close shave of short beard. Very pleased with this product hence deserving of 5 stars *****</li>
    <li> Seems to be lacking proper instructions..All works as promised</li>
    <li> For the price I guess I can&#x27;t complain too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery is good and the charge holds for a long time.  The charger is convenient to use.  It plugs directly into the outlet.  There are no cords to string across the counter top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is a little too large for my needs and the blade doesn&#x27;t cut as well as my old one.  The small pop-up trim blade works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably would not buy this model again.</li>
    <li> This panasonic beard and hair trimmer is great. It has all the functions you need in one item. You can select the length of cut you desire for your hair or beard with just a turn of knob. Also easy to clean and maintain and its wireless and charges fast.</li>
    <li> the best full beard cutter/trimmer that I have ever had; it also is the least expensive. (go figure)  No comb needed, it comes with a removable comb function piece that you dial in for the amount of hair to be removed.  Love it.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have noted, the attachment breaks easily. I called Panasonic to get replacement and they flatly refused to send the replacement attachment citing that the attachment is not covered under limited warranty.  If you are not going to remove the attachment then this is a really good trimmer but not removing the attachment reduces its use by 75% for me.  There have been so many complaints about this attachment, I expect that Amazon would stop selling this unless Panasonic fixes the issue or recall the trimmers or provide replacement free of cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer since I was a child. I have a very simple crew cut and since the age of 15-16 I&#x27;ve been using this to trim and clean up my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: rechargeable and cord free operation, ultra light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: adjustable head breaks very easily! Replaced it about 5 times now.</li>
    <li> I have had these just over a month and am very happy with them. i am careful not to break the trimmer guard as many have said happened to them. i have not had a problem. it is very quiet, more of a hum than a loud buzz. they were just what i was looking for. great price 10x better than the last pair (wahl&#x27;s) i had.</li>
    <li> Durable, does everything well, detail trimmer useful yet unobtrusive, great battery life, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy one if you have a beard or love someone with one.</li>
    <li> works good, but doesn&#x27;t cut as short as I would like</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Many adjustable length settings from Hipster to Clean Shaven&lt;br /&gt;Wet and dry&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Quiet and easy operation -- meaning quick shaving time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Careful on lowest setting and angle you use it or you&#x27;ll nick yourself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently trimmed up my hair and was looking to do the same with my beard. I didn&#x27;t want to completely shave and have baby face with my new &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;. I bought this hoping to get a close shave and it works wonders. It&#x27;s quiet, easy to use, easily rechargeable, and has many areas of use. I would recommend this clipper to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great for trimming my puppy and my brother is using it also.  His shaver broke and he likes this one.</li>
    <li> Just purchased my second one of these. The first one has lasted almost three years, and lots of abuse. I haven&#x27;t used a razor since the day I bought it because my wife likes the thin stubble look.  Waterproof, so I use it in the shower on face and all other body parts that require grooming to keep the wife happy :) One note - with the guard at its lowest setting, I was getting too long of a cut.  I removed it completely (just pull it off - it goes back on) and it gives you the \\&quot;not so close\\&quot; shave look, rather than a trim beard. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This has a nice ergonomic design and  has a quality feel.  Great that you can clean it easily under the tap. I like the fact fact that you are never stuck with a dead charge as you can can use it plugged in for an emergency trim. The power switch is small; a little bit difficult to find if you&#x27;re not looking at it. The trimmer length cannot be adjusted while powered on, which is a minor inconvenience.  Overall an excellent Panasonic product</li>
    <li> this trimmer is all that was advertised and more. i have very short hair and use the trimmer to keep it that way. so far it is the best trimmer ive had and ive had a few. i would tell my friends to purchase this item. very good deal with competitive price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer only twice, but my initial opinion will lead me to return it.  When trimming my moustache, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get the areas close under the nose.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I used it to cut my sons hair, but it kept binding up and pulling his hair.  I ultimately gave up and returned to the old Oster clippers I have.  They buzzed right through with no problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be sending this item back.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this product from Amazon, but through another retailer (cheaper). I did do my research first and came across all the reviews for this product on Amazon. Since it was less than $40, I decided to give it a shot. I own this product for roughly two months now. I am stationed overseas and decided to cough up the $40 vs. $8 haircuts once a week. It more than paid for itself in no time. I give myself a simple haircut once a week (just one length throughout). Some of the user comments on Amazon did not affect me and I felt compelled to tell about it: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. Binding. Just keep your hair short and trim often and it won&#x27;t bind. What else can you expect from a cordless trimmer. They do not put out power compared to a corded electric one. Even with the trimmer plugged in, it still will bind. I found this out the very first time I used it. My hair was about 1 1/2 inches long. Yes, it did bind (the first time). After keeping my hair at setting 8 (roughly 1/4 inch), it does not bind anymore. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2. Setting dial gets accidently turned. I never had a problem. Besides, the way I hold the shaver my thumb is permanently planted on the dial anyway so it will prevent it from turning. The other reviewers who had this problem may have been holding it the wrong way. It does require a little finesse, but you&#x27;ll get the hang of it by the second or third time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3. Ease of cleaning. The description does not lie when it says submersible. Easy to clean removable blades. Water does not affect this trimmer at all. Very good water-proof design by Panasonic. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4. Comes with a little oil bottle and small brush. I clean the thing every single time I use it so it&#x27;s ready to go the next time. Just oil the blades after every use (Panasonic recommended oiling before and after). I found too much oil will make it harder to clean because the hair sticks more and water can&#x27;t simply wash it out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3. Overall this trimmer is good to go. Will save me a lot of $ during my 1 year deployment. Plus the good thing is I don&#x27;t have to wait in line anymore to get a 5 minute haircut!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> ASIN:B000KEAA2Y Panasonic All-in-One Cordless Hair and Beard Trimmer Washable Grooming Trimmer - Silver [Model ER224S]--    While the cordless feature is convenient this device does NOT provide the precision necessary (especially on short men&#x27;s cuts) and will not cut well without pressing it further into the hair and then it will TAKE OFF MORE THAN YOU BARGAIN FOR !!!!! Have tried to work with this device more than once without success... and there is more maintenance required of this device than the device noted below.     I have used the remington that have combs that need changing out with no problems whatsoever. This is the one that you can get from the drugstore. [[ASIN:B0001ZMXSQ Remington HC-8017 Precision 18 Piece Haircut Kit Corded]]. Even if you are an individual trying to use this on your own head for a quick trim, there is much less chance of an error with the remington.     Anyone with suggestions on how to use these new models with the dial a combs- I&#x27;m all ears...</li>
    <li> very good not too sure how long the charge will last</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Works as advertised and works very well in the shower! Love the adjustable head and that you can remove the safety guard for cleaning. I&#x27;m worried the safety guard might eventually break with repeated removals but so far we&#x27;re great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good battery life as well.</li>
    <li> Ok before the battery dies.  First one lasted a year second lasted slightly less than 10 months.  Time to find something better.</li>
    <li> Feels good in the hand. This was purchased to replace an older wahl trimmer, and I wish I had replaced it sooner. This one feels much better in the hand and is easy to maneuver. The blades are sharp, and it seems that this will be a great little work horse.</li>
    <li> This is the first cutter that does it all and I have used over 8 different ones keeps my beard shirt cuts the hair and keeps parts clean.</li>
    <li> My fiance has fine hair, and it will not cut it the way it should.  I usually end up having to pull out my scissors.  Waste of money for us.</li>
    <li> Nice little gadget, not as good as a double edged Gillette razor for beards, or that plastic razor cutter I got for less than $1.00, but it comes closer than most electrics to doing what it says. When you are trying to cut your thin, grey old crown though, swipe the thing up your head instead of down. It takes off more hair that way, but watch out for the angle you are holding it at. No matter what setting you use, if you are holding the entire clipper horizontally to your head, you will end up with about ½ inch of hair on your already thinning scalp.</li>
    <li> This is a good trimmer at an affordable price. It functions well, safe and easy to use.</li>
    <li> use it all the time,  great price for what it does...  bought more then one as a back up (in case they go out of stock)&lt;br /&gt;Even if it only lasts a year (had my first one for over 2) it&#x27;s worth the price....  saves me the cost of a haircut every few weeks and just one pays the cost of this clipper.</li>
    <li> purchased to replace an identical trimmer that only gave up the ghost after 5 years of daily abuse from the reviewer.</li>
    <li> I have given 3 starts because I wish it had a longer setting and battery life.  In Italy, my trimmer goes up to 2” long, and lasts like a month or more on one charge but I couldn’t find the Phillips/Norelco anywhere.  I have had this Panasonic trimmer for 3 years already, and just ordered this one to replace the one I gave to a friend.  It is pretty good though.  Battery life could be A LOT better. Basically there’s nothing else out there comparable.</li>
    <li> this is my third one of these over the years. Usually the battery gets to where it won&#x27;t charge anymore after 3 or so years. For the price, I am fine with that. I can&#x27;t find any flaws. The comb breaks a bit easy, but Amazon has replacements available for cheap.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to a trimmer for quite some time. Finally after searching, found this one. I&#x27;ve used it twice and am very happy with it.  Especially cordless.</li>
    <li> I first began growing a beard three years ago while living abroad. I bought a babyliss for men e842xe there and it worked well enough but three years later the adjustable length guard has snapped and I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement so after doing research I found this one by Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Panasonic for one trim so far and like other reviewers I think one must be careful with the adjustable guard but it seems solid and does a great job trimming the beard and is quite affordable. There are also replacement guards you can buy for $1 on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Excellent beard trimmer</li>
    <li> product is  versitility and ease of use also the value for price is pretty good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons ; Its hard to remove head to clean but otherwise not a big deal</li>
    <li> Comb broke after 3 months.  Never dropped or abused, clearly a poor design.  At $12 + shipping it&#x27;s basically totaled.</li>
    <li> I AM DISAPOINTTED WITH PANASONIC BECAUSE THIS PRODUCT. THE DESIGN IS AMAZING AND PRACTICAL FOR HANDS, BUT DON&#x27;T WORK WELL. I LEAVE IT IM THE GARBAGE.</li>
    <li> This is the first beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I&#x27;ve used it just once so far; today in fact.  I enjoy the results very much.  I have a full beard and I love growing my facial hair out for that handsome three day shadow look, but up until now I had to shave my beard clean off once it got to a certain length.  I dislike being clean shaven so this trimmer does the trick quite well - it has 14 adjustable lengths and can trim to as short as .04\\&quot;!  From my experience today I&#x27;m certain I can perpetually create the beard shadow look whenever I want, and I enjoy that!  So far I have no gripes about this trimmer whatsoever.  This one beard trimmer comprises all of my experience with beard trimmers, so there may be many others out there that are better or worse, but so far this one works fantastically.</li>
    <li> This has a nice ergonomic design and has a quality feel. Great that you can clean it easily under the tap.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these quite a few years ago, and used it regularly to trim my beard, moustache, and hair.  I finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge so, instead of trying to replace the battery I just purchased a new one.  Lots of models available, but I just stuck with the one I knew and liked.</li>
    <li> I gave it back. I had an Oster for the last 15 years and it was just great. This one is just bad. The hair has to be removed again and again or it will stop cutting. I really do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned one of these before and it lasted for a really long time. The design and functionality has not much changed much. This is an easy to use product that works great.</li>
    <li> Ergonomically, this is a very nice shaver.  Unfortunately, it broke after minimal use in less then 2 months, which is just past the Amazon 30 day return policy.  Motor still works, but the shaving blades do not move.  The shaving blades pop off and snap back on easily, they are seated correctly, and I oiled them and can move them easily with my fingers but they still won&#x27;t move by the motor. Oh well,</li>
    <li> I received this in one day. When I opened it and used it it worked really good ! I would recommend this product 💯%</li>
    <li> A nice piece of equipment -- I think it will serve us well/</li>
    <li> Great little unit for trimming your beard. Light weight and easily used anywhere. I don&#x27;t use it for hair trimming only because I choose to leave that to the professionals, so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but I am very pleased with it as a bread trimmer. There is a video under the review area which I looked at before buying it that gives good insight in using the trimmer effectively. I suggest you check it out if you&#x27;re interested in purchasing this unit.</li>
    <li> The need: To save money by cutting my own hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;The product&#x27;s performance:  By no means a professional tool, however, it does the job.  It is mostly plastic, yet surprisingly sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Who should buy: Especially good for those looking to maintain a lower cut, a 1 or 2 guard. Should be comfortable using a second mirror, or asking for help from a second person if not.&lt;br /&gt;The bad: The shaver can change the height position at times if you&#x27;re pressing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  Product lasted two years.  It was probably used at least 50 times, saving me $750 (50 cuts @ $15/pop at the barber).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few months and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> everything that was expected!</li>
    <li> Is a very bad product. It doesn&#x27;t cut any hair.I will not recommend to anybody for sure. Very very bad product and really really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just fine, no problems at all. Not an issue, arrived, I used it and it works. Okee dokee, artichokeee. Not bad.</li>
    <li> Outstanding trimmer.  I have a nice Wahl for my head and this for my beard, but now find myself using this one for everything.  Cleans under running water, I love how easy it is to change lengths and how that locks in once you turn the trimmer on.  As other reviews have mentioned, I also wish the plastic combs were stronger as they do seem fragile, but knowing this I try to be very careful.</li>
    <li> Simple and works well</li>
    <li> Works great! Have given myself two hair cuts since getting it.</li>
    <li> this trimmer is awesome. Many different guard settings. Once you turn it on, the guard locks into place so it wont slide while you&#x27;re trimming. Has a secondary fine tip trimmer built in that you can pull out and use. Trims all the little stubble off your face. Makes it look like you shaved rather than trim. Its that close. Waterproof-ness is no joke. you can dunk this in water and nothing happens. Excellent shaver!</li>
    <li> Great, and convenient. Battery runs down more quickly than anticipated.</li>
    <li> Battery charger without cable feature, long charging time short operating time. Blade not smooth</li>
    <li> Kinda cool that you can use it in the shower but hairs bind up in the guard</li>
    <li> Our family has had several trimmers over the last 20 years.  This one is by far the best quality - hand grip is nice and the length setting is great.  Only issue is wish it held the cut hair instead of letting it fall.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying a new beard trimmer, &amp; it seems that most of the Panasonic beard trimmer&#x27;s are the best one&#x27;s available today instead of the usual names such as Norelco, Wahl or Remington. This particular model seemed to be the best choice based not only for it&#x27;s features but the price was reasonable too. The best things about this trimmer is that it&#x27;s cordless, there are MANY settings for the beard length, there&#x27;s a mini trimmer for detail &amp; touch-up work, it&#x27;s quiet, &amp; the charge holds for a long time---I&#x27;ve had this trimmer about a month &amp; it&#x27;s still going on only 1 charge! The drawbacks are that the blades (except the mini trimmer) aren&#x27;t very sharp, you can only adjust the settings when it&#x27;s off, there is more maintenance required than some trimmers require, &amp; you have to be careful when removing &amp; attaching the beard comb. I would say it&#x27;s worth checking out, but it definitely takes a few good uses to get used to it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great, cuts better than expected, and operates with a minimum of noise. I&#x27;ve trimmed my beard and cut my scalp hair several times. And, the cutting action is very effective with no snagging or pulling of hair - utterly ouchless. Combine this with the quiet operation and I will have to agree with another review that this is ideal for cutting children&#x27;s hair, leaving them nothing to be afraid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only major problem I have with this trimmer is that it has no path for hair clippings. They quickly collect inside the guard and hinder cutting performance unless continuously emptied every 10 to 30 seconds. On a light beard, this might equate to only 1 or 2 interruptions per trim. But, when clipping scalp hair, it makes for a very busy session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will reiterate another review by saying that removing the guard is less than intuitive or easy. But, success using a suggested technique makes in manageable. The technique involves leaving the trimmer on while removing the guard. Leaving it on effectively locks the guard pin from moving with the guard while removing and reattaching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technique for Easier Guard Removal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the trimmer is on, clasp the trimmer upright in both palms with the dial facing you. Place your thumbs on both corners of the guard closest to the dial and push the guard outward (away from you) using your thumbs. You should hear the guard pin click once released. Then you can easily pull the guard off. One quick shake of both the guard and trimmer should release any clumps of hair clippings. Reattaching the guard should be easy enough. Just listen for the guard pin to click back into a secured position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: If you use the trimmer on the shortest setting, you may find it difficult to get your thumbs behind the corners of the guard for a push. So, I recommend a minimum setting of 5 while removing the guard.</li>
    <li> Considering the pprice and the functionality of it i think this is the best shaver i have boughten in years. i will def keep an eye out for this brand</li>
    <li> My husband had two razors before this one...one that was a beard trimmer with the comb and another with the small trimmer to edge and clean up the lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one takes care of BOTH of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I miss his old beard trimmer is it had a built in vacuum to suck up the whiskers before being transported to the trashcan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this one is great.  It&#x27;s quick and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;v had mine for several years now (purchased at a higher price) and I am very happy with the product.  I used mine for my goatee and mustache which works wonderfully.  The mustache part can be a little tricky due to the width of the shaving head but it is certainly workable.  I&#x27;d definitely buy another when mine dies or it&#x27;s upgraded trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have had this for several months, keeps a charge a very long time, even using it every couple of days</li>
    <li> I have had three of these.  Every time, the battery starts to get weak and dies after about one year.  And the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very well, even when it is new.  They are still using the old NiCad&#x27;s and they really need to switch to hybrid NiMh or Lithium ion.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m very happy with the way this trimmer works. it gives a smooth finish and shaper is really good and works well</li>
    <li> Works perfect!!!  Is very versital.</li>
    <li> Completely stopped working after about a month and a half and a couple of uses. Piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I had the same product for about nine years and it worked great until I dropped it. This seems a little less powerful than the previous one. It also doesn&#x27;t work on the old ones base, which is strange, but not really relevant since it comes with one. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> New to beards.  this puppy does the  trim well and i like the small popup trimmer.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. Great price point and he loves that you just turn the dial for the different combs and you don&#x27;t need extra pieces lying around!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my wahl groomer and unfortunately the head is just way to big to get my goatee just right. Had to replace it with an actual goatee trimmer.</li>
    <li> Did not work well. I bought a great one from a competitor</li>
    <li> I like this trimmer, cut hair, beard and trim other hair with the pop out. At first I thought that as you adjust the head it could slip and push in while cutting your hair, it does not, it locks in place when the trimmers are turned on.</li>
    <li> Very good product for a very good price. It&#x27;s fuctioning efficiently. I had one minor issue (my mistake) that I didn&#x27;t note that the voltage of the product is 110v whereas the voltage in my country is 220v. Just bought a transformer and I&#x27;m perfectly ok.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Good quality trimmer at a fair price. I am writing this post well over 2 years after purchase and it is still going strong.</li>
    <li> I like this trimmer. It&#x27;s strong and it does the job, plus the small trimming blades are a useful bonus. All the other sub-40 trimmers I bought broke within a week. It&#x27;s cheap and well built, I think k it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> Update: After almost three years of using this trimmer, I&#x27;ve grown to like it more and more. I now wear my hair clipped very short and have found this trimmer to be just right for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review: If you&#x27;re only using this as a beard trimmer, you&#x27;ll probably like it a lot.  It works pretty well despite the fact that the tines on the guard are a bit too thick.  Where it fails is as a hair trimmer.  The design of the guard traps hair inside and makes it so you have to disassemble the front of the unit every few strokes and clean out the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the charger has no cord--it just plugs in and the trimmer clips into it.  I also liked the way the guard setting is locked in place by the power switch when it&#x27;s in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position.  There&#x27;s lots to like here, but it isn&#x27;t perfect.  I imagine a guard redesign could turn this into a five-star product.</li>
    <li> This product does not work well. At best, this clipper is best suited for minor dry cuts.</li>
    <li> returned this trimmer before I even tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if Panasonic is trying to save a buck but this really bugs me...&lt;br /&gt;the trimmer comes with a charging base that has built in prongs to plug into a socket. the charging base stands on your bathroom counter perfectly with trimmer, but that&#x27;s not how you have to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;the charger base does not come with a cord to plug it in so it can sit on the counter. you can only charge the trimmer by first placing it onto charger base, and plugging both directly into a wall socket !!!&lt;br /&gt;who was the genius who came up with this idea. try plugging both into a wall socket without the weight of both hanging in socket causing it to lean and eventually loosen and fall out of the socket.&lt;br /&gt;who ever heard of a counter top charging stand that doesn&#x27;t sit on the counter obviously the folks at Panasonic. no you plug into the wall socket with the trimmer standing straight up.. hey this is a hair trimmer not a night light !!!&lt;br /&gt;of course you can always opt to use your own extension cord and leave base/trimmer on the counter charging... try using a 50&#x27; orange one you could also plug in some appliances, or a string of lights too.&lt;br /&gt;okay I am finished....  oops I forgot if by any chance your bathroom wall sockets are under a medicine cabinet, a mirror, or anything that sticks out above the socket you will have to use an extension cord period for that matter because you wont have the clearance to plug the base/trimmer into socket.&lt;br /&gt;here&#x27;s a thought you can just plug the trimmer in your garage when you need it go in the garage, and fetch it.</li>
    <li> Past trimmers I bought pulled hairs out of my beard and bogged down, even stopping while trimming.  I bought this one largely because another reviewer said, \\&quot;At least it didn&#x27;t pull my hairs.\\&quot;  They were right.  At first, it seems too large and bulky to get into tight places of effectively trim close to your nostrils, but it does a great job in tight places as long as you work the angles.  Most importantly of all, I can trim my goatee and mustache in less than five minutes without a single hair being pulled.  Quick and painless was what I wanted, and this trimmer fits that bill.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It is ideal for maintaining a short beard and works just as well for a quick hair cut.  I like that it is able to cut multiple lengths with just the one attachment.  The attachment locks firmly in place while the motor is running and cuts consistently at the desired length without any difficulty.  The only disappointment is with the instruction manual which is poorly organized and lacking in detail.</li>
    <li> I have had a beard for 30 years and have tried a variety of beard trimmers. This one ranks up there with the best. It has a wide trimming edge which allows for a more consistent beard length with less possibility of gouging the beard. It also has a wide variety of beard heights to choose from. This product is so easy to use I find myself trimming my beard more often which results in a more groomed appearance.</li>
    <li> great product.this is my second one.cuts and trims great.a+</li>
    <li> This clipper is the worst buy I have ever made. Thought \\&quot;panasonic\\&quot; brand is good, but the clipper catches all the hair and you have to remove it every 5 sec, otherwise you cannot cut. To do that you have to remove the comb, which is another headache, the design is just not working. Do yourself a favor and buy a simple clipper, or if you want to spend 120+ $$ get an oster...</li>
    <li> Good points.  It has good power and plenty of battery.  Cuts clean.  Fits the hand well.  Plastic guard allows you to trim but allows for longer hair for beards and such.    Bad point.  I have only been using this trimmer since the first of May (2.5 months) and the plastic guard is broken in two places on the sides.  This renders the guard useless.  I tried to glue with crazy glue but it will not hold.  This is truly a pity since this trimmer/guard combo had so much going for it.</li>
    <li> Very upset. Flimsy attachments battery life is terrible. A bad product.</li>
    <li> Probably a great unit at an excellent price but did not have a setting I could use.  Returned.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product few days ago, but it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations at all. I was so disappointed by this shaving machine. Save your money and buy something else</li>
    <li> Panasonic,,Again,,,A &amp;#34; G R E A T &amp;#34; Brand....Can&#x27;t Go Wrong...&#x27;&amp;#34;Will / Would &amp;#34; Purchase Again,,And Again,,And Again etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Sam :)))))</li>
    <li> It would be a fine product if not for one serious flaw -- the brittle plastic that is used to form the guide comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned two of these and they have both failed when the sides of the guide fractured and it could no longer remain attached to the body of the trimmer. The first one I have repaired with super-glue a number of times, finally gave up and got a second. It failed also, glued it, it failed again, now I give up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame, the motor and cutter head run fine.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is flawless.  I have a Panasonic shaver...it is 10 years old and doing well.  I think this trimmer will be with me for a longtime,</li>
    <li> Has worked perfectly for years.  Use with the straight side facing your skin, or it will barely work at all!</li>
    <li> Good shaver but impossible to get close with it due to permanent guard</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer for my nephew and sent it to India. The bad thing is, this trimmer worked only couple of days. then it is stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;I will be very happy, If you send me a properly working piece. But I cannot return the damaged piece as it is there in India&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Prakasham Maheepathy</li>
    <li> My dad has alzheimers so trying to shave him or giving him a haircut is all about timing and moving fast when opportunity presents itself. These clippers  great! They are very quiet and hold charge well. The cordless nature makes it easy for me to go to him instead of trying to get him to come to me.  The adjustable guard allows for quick transitions in length, and the fact that they are quiet (not silent, but a low hum) seems to not frighten my dad the way his other electric shaver does. I can remove the guard and do a one-day scruff look on his face and it doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull the whiskers (just be careful if you do this -you&#x27;re still working with a blade). I would definitely recommend this for someone in a similar situation or with young children who aren&#x27;t quite ready for a trip to the salon.</li>
    <li> This was a great product for a while. Then the adjustable (and removable) comb part snapped making it only usable as a trimmer. The battery also only lasts for maybe 1.5 uses.&lt;br /&gt;I do like how it is wet/dry for use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it more starts, but it just does not last long enough.</li>
    <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
    <li> When using to cut hair (less than one inch) needed to constantly remove trimmer attachment to clean it (which isn&#x27;t an easy process and had fear of breaking it) otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t cut the hair. I would not recommend this produce, and I returned mine.</li>
    <li> I really like these clippers. I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair and trimming my beard for a couple of years now and this trimmer is really quick and easy to use. It&#x27;s also dead easy to clean and since it&#x27;s cordless, you can even take it into the shower, which makes cleanup even simpler. I wish it had a longer setting for my hair, but I like to keep it pretty short anyway. The shape of the extension makes it impossible to give yourself a divot (well, not impossible... by very unlikely).</li>
    <li> Excellent as a beard trimmer. Saves a lot of time I spent trimming with scissors. Careful not to cut hair when the head setting&lt;br /&gt;is between the 1 &amp; 2 setting. Thinking it is set at 12. Extremely short hair.</li>
    <li> Great at cutting my 3 year olds hair.  My corded Wahl clipper worked well, but was very noisy and intimidating for my son.  This cordless Panasonic clipper is great because:  1.  It&#x27;s cordless  2.  Guards built in and are easy to dial into a different lengths  3.  Long lasting charge    It&#x27;s not as powerful as my corded Wahl - but it&#x27;s definitely good enough to cut a toddlers hair.</li>
    <li> I found this at Ross for $16 and I have used this to cut my hair (yes no trip to the barber, just do it all over on setting - between 5-8 closest to a #2 on barbers clippers) for over 2 years now and its still going strong and the hair looks fine, no one has ever commented on it looking messed up or patchy, Mine is just a plug into the bottom not a fancy base. One thing I might mention, you mention worrying you&#x27;ll break the guard one day.. I dial it all the way to 20 then I \\&quot;pinch\\&quot; it or lift it off the peg. this works great and no worries about breaking it (or stripping the lock on the dial) but just make sure you put the dial back down (the peg will scratch you).</li>
    <li> Panasonic made a good trimmer in this unit. Takes a bit of time to learn to hold the cutting head in the proper angle. Adjustable head is some nice engineering, except removing the head is puzzling at first and I was fearful I might break it. Video review guy has a good method - turn unit on, grasp head on both sides and pull. Nice product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to at a fair price.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Practical and easy to use and above all SILENT!  The voltage could be BIVOLT, mas&#x27;só found in 110 volt version.  Otherwise, the product is very good.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4USF8/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
    <li> This clipper is well-designed and easy to use. A nice feature is the lock on the depth setting that engages when it is turned on.  However, its depth setting is useless when I try to cut a long beard back to a more trimmable length. The close-spaced teeth collect the hair and shield the cutter from any further action after the first sweep.</li>
    <li> I bought this several months ago, but already I need to look for something else to replace it with. The plastic trimmer guide is just too fragile. I have been through THREE replacement plastic pieces (they are available to order on [...] and aren&#x27;t too expensive), but removing and putting it back on strains the weak plastic. (The first time it broke was my fault for knocking it on the floor). If they would have made it out of a stronger material, this would have been perfect. It would also have been nice if they included a stand for it. It sits in the charger in the wall, but there is no on-off switch on the charger, so you must remove it when charging is complete or risk ruining the battery. Good concept, but is just not sturdy enough for my use.</li>
    <li> I had this for just over 3 years and really liked it. It has broken recently in the place mentioned by others and where the picture represents it in red. I&#x27;m using some superglue right now and its working but came back to put one in my cart again in case I need it fast.</li>
    <li> It has a little mini razor if you detach the silver gauge from the top. It&#x27;s working well so far, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Clunky - too wide and big.  Good for large areas.</li>
    <li> I bought this almost 4 years ago because it was cheap, waterproof, and cordless.  The battery life on this thing is amazing for someone like me who likes to not shave for a week or 2 and it&#x60;s always ready from the last time I charged it unlike other battery clippers I have that is always dead every time I need it.  The plastic attachment-guard is nice, but I never use it anymore.  I just use it bare to shave my face and hair, it does not shave you bald, I would compare it to uses clippers with a 1/4 or 1/8th attachment, which is perfect for me.  The little side trimmer I honestly always forget about and I can&#x60;t remember if it is good.  This is very good if you are on the go and need a trim, it&#x60;s light, reliable, and easy to clean.  It does the job that I used to have to use 3 different trimmers for all in 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing about it is it is super powerful, if you have really thick hair on your head it may take a while if you use the guard.  If you are just shaving your head clean or beard off with no guard and like a little stubble, or do not mind having to use a regular razor to remove stubble it&#x60;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 more thing, I did drop it, the guard busted into pieces, but I bought a replacement on Amazon for less than 5 bux.  No big deal considering I do not use it anymore</li>
    <li> The guard broke off the clippers right after our 30 day warranty ended.</li>
    <li> Works great. After a couple of years I have to buy a new one... this is my second. I always use it in the shower and rarely oil it. Unless something better comes along I&#x27;ll buy another one in a few years.</li>
    <li> Works good enough for beard and head hair. Guards don&#x27;t break as mentioned. If they do you can get a pretty cheap replacement here on Amazon. Only downside if it&#x27;s hard to cut beard under nose and make a clean side burn cut if you have a  shorter beard.</li>
    <li> This is my third ER224S and they have all worked extremely well.  The first one was lost. The second worked for a year until I dropped it onto concrete and although it still worked, something broke inside and it was very loud and shaky.  This is a very durable unit and it travels with me everywhere I go.  I use it every two days for shaving my head and face since I don&#x27;t like to razor shave that often. Battery life is excellent and the wall charger is easy to use.</li>
    <li> this is really handy and trims very well, i  just dont like removing the trimmer guides and replacing it, it kinda is weak in that aspect, but over all a great product, i can rinse it under the tap.</li>
    <li> I think the first one of these I bought was about 12 years ago.  I dropped that one so bought this one.  Much less expensive but still works very well.  I did like the adjustment and angle of use on the older one better but this gets the job done very well.</li>
    <li> it works very well, it has all the creatures I required for cutting hairs (not so good for beard), simple, essential, silent. very inexpensive compared to similar products. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I said it before and i will say it again. this is one of the great trimmers of all time, for the price. Great blades, great adjustments, great feel and balance and great power.The problem is, it has the worst trimmer comb of all time. The quality is so poor it will crack, if you holler at your wife. I am not kidding, anything will break this thing. several years ago when i had my original er224, as i finished trimming, i rinsed the unit off under hot running water, and the comb head cracked. The unit is wet and dry. If you order a er224s be sure to order an extra comb ( about $5 bucks), you will need it. I have to admit this is the second one i ordered as i dropped the unit and broke the first one. The drop was less than a foot, but it was still my fault. I wish panasonic would either include an extra comb or make it out of metal and charge more. Still for around $20 bucks the er224s remains a good value.</li>
    <li> Great value for price....</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re reading this review, there&#x27;s probably a 60% chance you&#x27;re wondering &amp;#34;will this work on my junk too?&amp;#34; Yes it will. Be careful if you remove the blade guard, it might nick you a little.  IT&#x27;S WATERPROOF! You can use it in the shower.  Works very well as a beard trimmer. You can remove the plastic blade guard and snap off the blade assembly (see the instructions.) I recommend cleaning it out after every use and re-oiling the blade with a few drops of the included oil (realistically takes about 5 minutes.)  It&#x27;s completely cordless, and comes with a nice little charger. The whole unit is wonderfully compact, and takes up next to no space.  EDIT: I have now been using this trimmer for almost 2 years. No issues at all. I still highly recommend it. Still not a good idea to use it on your junk, though.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality clipper.  Panasonic remains a brand you can depend on for quality and longevity in its products.  Cleaning is a breeze.  I would give it a 5 if the charing unit had a cable/coord rather than restrict itself to being a socket insert unit.</li>
    <li> So far, this is a pretty decent little trimmer. I needed something that was easily adjustable, and the trimmer that this is replacing had a comb that could be adjusted without changing combs or attachments, so that was one feature I really wanted. This trimmer has that feature, the comb is adjusted to the right length via the little dial on the front with no attachments to deal with or lose. There is a detail trimmer built into this, too, which is nice, but the detail trimmer is behind the comb, making it hard to use and awkward. I can see I&#x27;m going to be pulling the comb off to use the detail trimmer, which is a drawback for me. The charger for this also has no cord, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing but it did feel weird. The charger is a little box that plugs into the wall, and the trimmer snaps into the charger like it is hanging on the wall, so if you don&#x27;t have a lot of room around your outlets, this will not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;But so far, this is a nice little machine and it does what it should without over-complicating things.</li>
    <li> I got this trimmer for my husband to use on his beard. He loves it and says that it works well. There are a few attachments with it so that you can trim different lengths. He&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
    <li> i just bought it month ago, it is good until now, but i dont know how is it as a long time device. i hope if they change the colors</li>
    <li> The written instructions are sketchy as far as how to trim your beard. No guidance as to which setting to choose and when used for the first time one wonders if it will be too short-not long enough. Possibly, a chart to relate to the numbers on the dial.  The product is easy to use, attractive and the combination stand/charging is a clever feature. Should be clearer instructions regarding cleaning.</li>
    <li> I bought almost the exact same trimmer several years ago and got a good year or so of use out of it, then the comb broke.  I bought a complete replacement and the comb broke after just a couple months.  I will say that it does work pretty darn well when it&#x27;s not broken, though.  I guess you should try to avoid taking the comb off if you can.      I just ordered a replacement comb.  Hopefully it&#x27;s the right one.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised but have only had it for a month.  Quiet, does not pull at my beard and battery is lasting for a number of trims.</li>
    <li> The trimmer Works as expected and as described by the manufacturer. Also found a short video where some customer explains the right way to use the shaver. So far so good.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is as described by most, works well and holds a charge. The blade guide is a little strange but seems to work.</li>
    <li> Got for our son in law for his birthday and it was much better than we hoped. Water proof and compact. No clutter on the sink top - daughter&#x27;s complaint. A lot of shave and trim for the buck!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be real sharp. Have to go over my beard several times to get an even cut.</li>
    <li> works gr8 no problems. this is my 2nd 1 from amazon in 7 yrs &amp; I love this just terrific</li>
    <li> ...simply excellent. Cuts hair pretty well. Charger that plugs directly into wall is a very big plus, no cords on bathroom sink, and small enough for travel. Would be better if also had a light showing when fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic adjustable comb is prone to crack, but you can order a new one.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd try to find a great hair and beard trimmer.  When compared to my other trimmers ER224S does by far the best job.  It is sharp and and provides a variety of trimming options.  It is the perfect answer for keeping a neat beard.  The price makes it even better.  DJ</li>
    <li> Works great in or out of the shower.Dont like that you have to remove the guard to get to the fine trimmer</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> My 2nd shaver!,, love it and very good for reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I should have bought two! (One for my son and one for me!!). This is a great beard trimmer and allows for a variety of beard lengths. It is perfect for my son who have a nice beard, but who also on occasion shaves it off and starts it again. It was the best choice and remains perfect for him!</li>
    <li> this is bad trimmer,dont buy it,brunt,no good at all.&lt;br /&gt;drive me crazy,buy some philip,or something else.&lt;br /&gt;i want to return it.</li>
    <li> I had a similar Panasonic beard trimmer for years and was happy with it until the battery recently wore out.  I was pleasantly surprised to find this new one to be of equal quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that it&#x27;s all-in-one with no extra attachments, and that was the main criterion I had in choosing a new trimmer.  I don&#x27;t want a bunch of attachments and parts in my bathroom drawer!  I also like the way the charging adapter is designed without any cord (more stuff); the small adapter plugs directly into a wall outlet with the trimmer attached directly to the top of the adapter. The trimmer fits comfortably in the hand, it trims well, it is well-guarded against gouging accidents(!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my new trimmer, I wanted something simple yet well-made with good functionality and this trimmer is all that.  5 stars because I have no reasons to subtract any stars.</li>
    <li> Did my hair, beard, sideburns, mustache and eye brows in about 3 minutes due to the easy dial height !!!</li>
    <li> Wife talked me into growing a beard.  I thought that meant less prep time in the morning - so I agreed.  Not True!  Having a decent looking beard takes a bit more attention than shaving.  This trimmer is PERFECT.  It is as close to &amp;#34;fool proof&amp;#34; as I can imagine.  Mistakes are virtually impossible. It did take me some time to trust using it in the shower without a mirror, but it worked flawlessly.  For anyone new to growing a beard, I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely delighted by this product and cannot imagine a better unit. I am mainly using this trimmer to cut my hair, which I keep very short and cut once a week. First I am very pleased with the design. It is very comfortable in the hand and is not heavy. It is not very noisy either. The trimmer is cordless, but so is the charger, which is a small block that you plug in the wall with the trimmer inserted on top of it when it needs to be charged. What I like most is that we can select among 14 different settings, which makes it easy to find the desired length. And all we have to do is turn a wheel knob. Very neat! There is an additional small trimmer that can be used for the finishing touch or hard to reach places. I use this feature all the time and find it very convenient and easy to use, like the trimmer itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have complained about the plastic comb, which they say is fragile. Personally I have no problems with it and think it might be a handling issue. When you need to remove it I would advise you to set the trimmer to position &amp;#34;20&amp;#34;, and when you want to insert it back in you should set the trimmer to position &amp;#34;1&amp;#34;. Just make sure it is properly engaged before sliding it down and don&#x27;t force it. If you do this right the comb should last for ever. And like for most electric razors and trimmers, it needs to be oiled before use or after you are done with the shaving and have cleaned the unit. This will make the blade last much longer. The only real complain I have is that once the trimmer is fully charged the red light does not go out. The red light comes on when you plug the unit in the charger and remains on until you remove it, regardless of the charging condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought it I could not find a better trimmer for the price. But later on the price went up. Yet it remains an excellent value. I have not tried other models or other brands recently but if I needed another unit I could easily make the wrong choice. So I would almost certainly buy the same one again.d almost certainly buy the same one again.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my head for 9 years now and this is by far the best cordless trimmer/beard trimmer on the market period. I went through 3 different pairs of clippers with cheap breakable parts or motors that would burn out or plastic guards that would slip off during use. This trimmer has all the features a man like me could want, waterproof, cordless and very little maintainence. The clipper guard stays on during use and doesn&#x27;t slide off. I get that the main issue with this trimmer is the cheap breakable trimmer comb that does break from time to time, but it is a cheap and replacable part that you can order off here.The replacement comb attachment is really cheap as well, order a few of them at a time. I ordered 2 last week and in the 4 years I have had this trimmer the comb just broke for the first time last week.  I have had this trimmer for 4 years now and I use it at least 3 times a week both to shave my head and to trim up my beard which is a full beard. I love that I can use this in the shower and not get hair all over the floor/sink and mess up the bathroom. I love that the trimmer comb stays on when during use even if you push down on your scalp to get a closer shave. For years I have always wanted a cordless, waterproof trimmer for shaving my head which I do on a weekly basis and for trimming my beard and time and again it always came down to a high price and stupid attachments which slipped off during use, so I never was able to really get my hands on a good quality reliable trimmer until I found this trimmer on Amazon.com. It makes more sense to me at least to be able to order a few of the replacement combs once every 4 years than to throw out a perfectly good trimmer that is not only reliable but also dependable for the money. I also really like the pop up trimmer which I use to clean up the back of my neck and get the stray hairs that come with cleaning up the back of my neck every week when I shave my head. I keep the clipper attachment at a level 2, sometimes I will go down to a level 1. Wall dock charger is a great touch as well, frees up much needed space on my bathroom sink. The replacement attachment plastic comb will break but in my honest opinion for me anyways I have thrown out enough trimmers over the years and started from scratch spending $30 or more on a new trimmer each time and in the 4 years I have had this trimmer not only has it lasted this entire time over 4 years but the plastic comb juet broke for the first time last week. I ordered 2 replacement combs the other day and the total with shipping came to $11. $11 for 2 replacement combs in 4 years or a new trimmer that would burn out and attachments thst would slip off during use and wasn&#x27;t waterproof at the tune of $30 or more every year or two.....I&#x27;ll take the $11 replacement comb thank you very much! Fairly quiet operation as well, quick charging as well.I havent had to buy a new trimmer in 4 years and for me that&#x27;s been the best part. If your looking for a trimmer that covers all bases, is waterproof, easy to clean, doesn&#x27;t eat up a lot of space on your sink and can stand up to weekly use pick this devil up. I would honestly order a couple 2 or 3 replacement combs while you are at it just for a backup. I&#x27;ve only had to replace the comb once in 4 years.</li>
    <li> Fast and Good Service.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic Thanks.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this one. He was very excited to find that it was still available even 3 years after he purchased the original.</li>
    <li> Died after 7 months when used as specified in instructions. Don&#x27;t buy Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Cheap and Easy .  Cut adjustment locks in place when switched on.  Although I have a fog-less mirror in the shower, I don&#x27;t need it when using this.  Once-a-week cut, no drama.  Use in the shower, no mess to clean.  Oil the blade after dry.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I have been looking for. I was getting sick of cleaning up the sink and floor after cutting my hair and wanted something I could use in the shower. I have used this every day for a little over a month and it is perfect. I am a balding guy who likes to keep it as short as possible without taking a blade to it. The guard comes off completely and it gets as close as I expected. I use the attachment for trimming my beard and it goes on/off very easily (just one little notch that holds it on this little slider thing that moves with the dial/selector. It does not seem as flimsy as some other reviews report, maybe they changed the design since some of these older ones. I don&#x27;t expect it to ever break unless I drop it head first while it is still attached. As mentioned, I have used this every day to keep it short. Each time takes about a minute or 2, and I have only had to recharge this once so far, so I am pleased with its ability to hold a charge. It does not come with a cord to be able to use as a corded trimmer if it happens to die mid-cut, but this isn&#x27;t an issue for me, as a day&#x27;s worth of growth isn&#x27;t noticeable. The charger is a little brick with a built-in stand that it sits on right on the wall outlet.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for the same trimmer which I had for years...it died recently and so I bought the same model (updated)...very pleased.</li>
    <li> This trimmer uses 20 year old tech for the battery-nicad.  Nickel cadmium batteries are the type that need to be drained almost completely before charging,  are destroyed if overcharged and develop a \\&quot;memory\\&quot;.  Mine lasted a little over a year and wouldn&#x27;t charge enough for a one minute trim.</li>
    <li> Works well. Because it is cordless, it can be taken outside to cut hair -- avoiding cleaning hair from the floor.&lt;br /&gt;The charge is enough for several haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a small container of lubricating oil.</li>
    <li> Bought this about a month ago. I was a little afraid based on the 50/50 reviews, but after watching the video another reviewer posted gave it a try. After a few trims with it I am happy - for the money its a great value. Used an old metal Wahl for the last ten years which I let rust out and though it still works,  thought i would finally retire it. Was a bit shocked to see the price of cordless razors now ...well over $50. This one on sale/clearance for $25 made me give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression is that it looks good. I wanted a cordless one since i was tired of the twisted cord everything I pull my razor out. BUT I didn&#x27;t want one of those that sit on a corner dock taking up half the counter- after all how often do you use a trimmer maybe once a week? I dont need it out all the time. This one has a nice compact wall charger which can be left plugged in and it will hold the weight of the trimmer as well. So its off the counter and always charged. PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One down side I&#x27;ve noticed is that though it is waterproof, it doesn&#x27;t function well in the shower. Seems to need the hair to stand up in order to grab it. So the waterproofness is more a safety feature than a selling point. Other point, as many have noted, is that you need to set the trimmer guide from the get go. I didn&#x27;t realize that and in my eagerness to try it shaved my goatee off first time i used it. No big thing, but i should have looked or read the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good trimmer at a good price, dont listen to the negative posters on here- this thing works fine. To get something better you would need to spend $60 or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;follow up: when i dropped the thing for the first time, i broke the guard. VERYYYY Fragile. Its easily available for around $6, which is still a bummer. Despite that, i am still very happen with the trimmer after all this time. No other issues.</li>
    <li> When I first started using this product I was very impressed. I trimmed my beard every few days, and even had my girlfriend give me some nice haircuts. I was saving time and money and looked great. The battery stayed charged and mechanically was easy to use.    Then, less than two months after I bought it, the trimmer became unresponsive. Switching the power button on and off did nothing. The trimmer had been in the charger for 12 hours, with the charging light on, to no effect. Amazon tells me I cannot return the product because it&#x27;s been over a month, so I might try and contact Panasonic.     So, very disappointing to say, but do not buy this product if you would like it to work after 50 days.</li>
    <li> I have owned these clippers for about six months and use them once a week to maintain my buzz cut (5mm) and trimmed beard (2mm). Overall, I am quite happy with this product considering the price and performance (i.e value).  I wouldn&#x27;t consider them professional grade, but they get the job done with decent construction (except for guard), clean cutting performance, and easy use.  I have already saved over a hundred dollars and counting on hair cuts with these clippers; therefore, if the plastic guard breaks over time I wont really be too upset to by another guard or even clipper.    Pros: I get a nicely trimmed cut in the shower (water not running) without dealing with cords.  This makes cutting my own hair easy and I wash away the trimmings.  The clippers work just as well as the low-priced electric clippers I used before and I only have to charge the unit once every two haircuts.  The unit provides a good variety of short settings for beards and buzz cuts without a ton of attachments to store or misplace.  Note: the clippers do not allow for long hairstyles.    Cons: As others have noted, I would prefer for the fine trimmer to be accessible without having to remove the somewhat flimsy and breakable clipper guard.  I purchased a separate cordless trimmer in order to avoid having to remove the clipper guard often. Additionally, the fine trimmer is tiny and I have found it hard to accurately use by oneself.  An aluminum clipper guard would be more durable.</li>
    <li> VERY uneven cut, likes to pull hairs.  Actually had this at 2 stars (because I dont like leaving bad reviews), but then while typing this realized I had nothing good to say, so changed to 1 star.  Don&#x27;t buy unless you like being disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging now, but seems good to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy..</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver. He even got his hairdresser one for Christmas so that she would use her&#x27;s on him.</li>
    <li> works great, shaves close, awesome in shower. have to clean out attachment when wet alot but works great.  the trimmer comes out but at wrong angle you could cut off hair you wanted to leave with the large blade cause the detail er only comes out so far. the angle could cause you to loose your beard as it did to me.. oh well. No shave November _ conquered by the Panasonic, in January.</li>
    <li> Works really well! No problems at all so far!</li>
    <li> The charger doesn&#x27;t allow much clearance if you are connecting it to an outlet with a light switch. It does the job. Seems like an ok prize. I don&#x27;t expect it to last for ever since I go through these once or twice a year.</li>
    <li> It does a great job on my beard</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give a zero shave, the guard come off all the time.  Wish I had returned it, not happy with it at all.  Difficult to use by yourself, not very powerful.</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t a lot of great options in this space.  This one is handy that it has the adjustable clippers and wireless freedom.  The battery is the weak spot, it takes 15 hours to charge, doesn&#x27;t last long, and degrades capacity quickly so that you have to buy a new one every year or so.</li>
    <li> I got this to trim my beard in the shower as my wife constantly complains about the little beard hairs in the sink.  I figured this way I could trim with little to no mess.  I constantly clogs when dealing with wet hair which is inevitable while in the shower.  So I am back to using it on a dry beard in the sink.  Sorry honey.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on something like my 4th one of these in the past several years. Aside from eventually getting dull with regular use, I tend to drop them in the shower, which cracks the plastic cutting height adjustor. But my clumsiness aside, these things are great. Charge quickly, no cord (not even the charger), battery lasts a long time, and easy to clean. Given the low price and high reliability, I will just keep buying these things until one of these years Panasonic stops making them. One word of advice -- keep a spare handy. If you drop one and crack the housing, as I did, you might find yourself midway through a trim with no easy way to finish. Which could result in your going off to work (or wherever) looking quite ridiculous.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has proven to be one of the better investments I have made. For the last two years I have been cutting my hair and trimming my beard without a problem. No more visits to the barbershop for me.   At first I was concerned that the battery would discharge before I had the chance to finish my haircut, but now I have found out that it goes on and on and there&#x27;s plenty of charge left when I am done. Just take good care of it by cleaning and oiling with the provided brush and oil, and this should last you a long time. Also make sure to recharge it as soon as you are done using it.   The only con is that at first it will take you a while to figure out how to completely remove and then replace the hood that adjusts the cutting length (needed when you want a close trim, and to clean the unit after using it). You have to be careful doing this until you get the hang of it, as it is not intuitive or user-friendly.   I highly recommend this trimmer unless you are one of those persons who seems to botch even the smallest repair job. I would buy this trimmer again if it ever breaks, as I find it extremely useful and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> The big trimmer works well, but I really like the pop up trimmer. I also like the snap on charge adapter.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to clean, good value</li>
    <li> Think I got a bad one as I have always had good luck with Panasonic. Pulled more hair than it cut. As always in my case, Amazon made it right. ! star to trimmer, 5 stars for service.</li>
    <li> Had many different shavers and this once takes the cake.  I can trim everything and always look fresh!</li>
    <li> Its an awesome product! Plus its battery is long lasting. Worth buying it.</li>
    <li> Still trying to get better at using it....not what I expect.</li>
    <li> I tried two other clippers.  This is the best, by far.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about plastic clipper attachments.  Just turn the dial to get the length adjustment you want.  It is much less expensive, much lighter and much less noisy.  I could recommend this one over all the others.  There is one thing the folks at Panasonic could do: change the LED light to &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; when the battery is fully charged.  Otherwise. I recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Fantastic clippers.  Especially like that once you set the guard it locks in place when you turn the motor on.  No chance of gouging yourself as I have done with other clippers.</li>
    <li> This shaver works great for head and face.  Some say it gouges out hair and leaves bald spots.  However, I think that is due to the way they hold the shaver.  The forward combs have spring, while the rear combs are rigid.  As long as you base the shaver on the rear combs, you get an even shave.  If you roll it forward onto the front combs, they move out of the way and you get a gouge.  The gap between the front and rear combs make for an even cut.  The small trimmer is great, even for ears, because it does not bite you.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this thing. He says it&#x27;s so convienent to be able to shave cordless and straight out of the shower. The blade doesn&#x27;t pull his hair at all. He loves that you can have different lengths perfect for his sideburns. The trimmer makes it super simple to shape and shave his neck and cheeks. He uses it everyday and thanks me everytime!</li>
    <li> Very difficult to use and does no more than average at best in trimming my beard..</li>
    <li> Great price and it works great!</li>
    <li> Nice clipper, I was used to other clippers that didn&#x27;t need maintenance, so this is a bit strange for me, but if it&#x27;s your first clipper, or you&#x27;re used to it, zero problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also taking out the trimming accessory makes me have fear of breaking it every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But besides that, everything is fine with it. Also, the price is very low, I&#x27;ve saw lots of clippers on shops and they start on almost twice the price!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.....Can&#x27;t say enough. Easy to use, I&#x27;ve used it about 10 times and it&#x27;s still on it&#x27;s first charge strong as ever.</li>
    <li> It works great. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it can&#x27;t be plugged in while using it. My last one like this can be charged at the same time. This one needs to be charged before you use it.</li>
    <li> wonderful product cant say enough. i was skeptical when i got it for christmas from my wife, but it turned out to be way better than my old trimmer</li>
    <li> It could be a good product but there is a real problem with the hair comb which breaks on the two sides. And it&#x27;s impossible to find a replacement comb.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is OK, my old Norelco trimmer works much better, and that is the one I was trying to replace. The design of this trimmer is flawed. You have to hold it in a very precise angle to get it to work, and when it does work, the closest it can trim is about 10mm. It will not give you a closer trim unless you remove the plastic cover guard, but if you do that, the metal blade will pull on your hair. So really, if you want to trim anything closer than 10mm, look for something else.</li>
    <li> Probably the best trimmer/hair cutter I&#x27;ve ever used. Easy to charge, easy to use (face, neck, chest, not my back though...yet), easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All parts attached, not sure how I would lose anything.</li>
    <li> Previous Panasonic that was around same price worked better for everything. Not that hairy and it still misses at least half of any hair it goes up against. Its junk imo.....</li>
    <li> I have been using these clippers for over 10 years to cut my own hair. The ease of use is better than any other clippers I have tried. The only negative is the plastic guard breaks frequently (I have went thru at least 1 set per year).</li>
    <li> I cut my hair once a month, $ 10 per hair cut. I bought this product ,after 4th months I earn $10 every month.sometime more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for at least four years now, and love it. Got it for thirty dollars and it&#x27;s proven to be one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in years. I have to admit I haven&#x27;t even oiled it or replaced the blades! Not once!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to not only trim my beard, but I also cut my hair with it. It gives a reliable haircut every time, and I have so much experience with it now that I&#x27;m done in ten minutes. With the trim guide adjust wheel, it produces a more than acceptable fade cut. I take the guide off and use the bare blades to shape the sides and back of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is a snap. I&#x27;m going to use it until it dies! After four years the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge nearly as long as it used to, but these days I just keep it plugged in when doing anything more than a quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I use this machine for haircuts only. It gives a great cut but the plastic attachment is not very easily disconnected to remove hairs that get caught underneath it. After about a 10 uses the plastic attachment fell and broke. I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for over 15 years and I&#x27;ve dropped the plastic attachments numerous times before and never had an issue until now. I am still willing to give Panasonic another shot since I have been using their various trimmers for a very long time and have had much better luck in the past.</li>
    <li> I liked this trimmer for the year or so that I used it.  The adjustable settings used with the guard allowed me to clipper my arm and leg hair to a comfortable level while removing the guard let me get up close on my head and face.  I expected the unit to last longer than 1 year in terms of battery life cycle as it will now no longer take a charge.  Being a sealed unit, I am not going to attempt to replace the batteries (probably ni-cad AA equivalents.)  I hope to have better luck with a different brand and battery technology (lithium ion.)</li>
    <li> After about 6+ years of faithful and regular service my Panasonic clippers finally stopped holding a charge long enough for me to cut my hair. I was so happy with how this product performed, I bought another one.</li>
    <li> It has very fragil breaking points. Hard to replace the broken parts.&lt;br /&gt;Work well untill it breaks.&lt;br /&gt;Non Functional product!</li>
    <li> Very difficult to get replacement heads for this device and they break often.  I would look for an alternative product.  re Panasonic ER 224S</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this machine! I have three of them at home. One for me, my wife, and my brother.&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest it to everyone.</li>
    <li> battery will no longer take a charge after 8 months of infrequent use. wasn&#x27;t great when it worked, much less so now.</li>
    <li> Functions as described .</li>
    <li> i used to buy this product on best buy for more than $40.00,but i bought it here for less than $20.00 .i like this product to groom my beard.</li>
    <li> You simply cannot get a better beard trimmer for the money. I have spent far more on far crappier trimmers. This thing is clearly well built and well designed. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my dad and he is absolutely satisfied with it. Good price, good battery, great precision &#x3D; good buy</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. It&#x27;s adjustable, works pretty good. I used two of this trimmer and blades dull after a year, but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
    <li> The trimmer would be fine except for one major flaw: the plastic trimmer guard breaks under normal use.  And that&#x27;s a big flaw.  To access the sideburn trimmer or to clean the unit, you must remove the plastic guard.  But the plastic is CHEAP!  And after taking it on and off maybe thirty of forty times, it&#x27;s now snapped in two and completely useless.  Reading the other reviews, it seems I&#x27;m not the only person experiencing this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic has made it on my \\&quot;do not buy from\\&quot; list recently.  Their products have degraded in quality recently, and please take the time to look at my Panasonic Viera TV review.  They released a $4k HDTV to the market knowing full well it has fluctuating brightness issues in the darks, but refuse to fix it.  And now even their beard trimmers are garbage.  They are turning out to be a company to skip entirely.  Go with Samsung.  Or by Braun or Norelco for a beard trimmer.  Panasonic is just ripping its customers off.</li>
    <li> Easy to use trimmer, easy to clean. After it&#x27;s fully charged you can use it for a very long time.[[ASIN:B000F4USF8 Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Cordless Hair and Beard Trimmer (Silver)]]</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the trimmer... it performs exactly as advertised! The video posted on the Amazon review site was very helpful and prevented a lot of potential wasted time. The written instructions are not clear and the video tells you how the trimmer works and how to use it. Suits my needs well.</li>
    <li> I find this trimmer easy to use- easier than other trimmers I&#x27;ve had, though it does have two finnicky bits: the comb and the charger.  But neither of those is a deal breaker.  It&#x27;s very quiet.  The adjustable comb works well.  I get consistent length everywhere.  Removing the comb is a little dodgy, but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s fine.  You just have to pull it straight off with just a little more effort than seems prudent.  And don&#x27;t squeeze.  The detail trimmer thing seems like a great idea, but in practice I wind up just using the bare main blade.  Being able to use this in the shower is the real winner.  It keeps the beard mess in the bathroom to a minimum, which keeps the marriage healthy  :)</li>
    <li> I got this hair trimmer back in 2009 and is still in use in 2014. I use it roughly once a month oil the blades and fully charge it after each use. Lately the battery went bad and I need to charge it a few hours to get 25 minutes of use so it&#x27;s soon for replacement. The blades still cut as new, great design , strong materials and good engineering, overall great product. I purchased a Remington (blinded by their advertising I guess) and is definitely inferior , wish I would of sticked with this same model …</li>
    <li> Now I have always bought inexpensive $30 trimmers at drug stores etc. This trimmer was in that same price range and to my surprise this trimmer is so so great.  It is light weight, so easy to use, cordless and I now give my sons and husband flawless haircuts!  I would recommend this trimmer to everyone!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product.  I have had two Norelco trimmers and both had battery failure after about a year.  Hoping to find a quality item that would last, I opted for the Panasonic.      My research found that this offered superior trimming.  I have found that the trim is not all that even - certainly no better than the Norelcos.  Maintenance as well is somewhat difficult.  You are supposed to oil the blades after each use - a slightly messy, inconvenient process.  I&#x27;m used to using a trimmer and being done with it.  And unless I&#x27;m doing something wrong, the oil spread through the blades, making cleanup even harder.  I wouldn&#x27;t say this is terrible but given the chance to do it over I would buy something else.</li>
    <li> In less than a year 3 of the plastic hair guards self-desctructed. The flimsiest thingies I have ever seen and they are covered only by a 30 day warranty. Otherwise, the trimmer is excellent.</li>
    <li> Simply said this trimmer is a real piece of junk !  It has no power; the comb catches all the hair so you have to remove it every 10 sec, also the plastic teeth are so flexible if you press to much you go down to size 0 (not bad for the summer otherwise...)!  Trust me this is my fourth trimmer and by far the worse !  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  I am going for another one.</li>
    <li> This is the first trimmer I have bought and I would say its just amazing. Elegant, easy to use, very effective and accurate. I specially like the small blade which can trim the edges of beard and Side locks. Since its washable I can clean it easily after using. Other thing I like about this it doesn&#x27;t have N number of attachments to carry around, the adjustable comb(with a Quick Adjust Dial) does all the job and can be detached. Great battery backup too ! Last but not the least Amazon is offering it at a great bargain.     A couple of things I have noticed; Instruction Manual doesn&#x27;t explain clearly how to remove the comb[just has a drawing]  and use the small blade. Be very careful while detaching/attaching the comb as the lever holding it appears to be delicate. Its 110V only so you would need a voltage converter if you want to charge it outside US.    I would strongly recommend this product to anyone looking for a reliable trimmer. A great value for money !!</li>
    <li> I have used this to shave my head several times in the shower. It works great.</li>
    <li> Good product.works as said.Had few problems in 1st use but I changed the angle of trimming a s suggested and got closer to a clean shave.Will definitively recommend to a friend.This is the 2nd product I m buying from Panasonic.They rule  men&#x27;s grooming products as always...</li>
    <li> I find the product as per my expectations&lt;br /&gt;easy to operate and maintain</li>
    <li> Its bulky and on the shorter end it lacks precision that I feel a beard trimmer should have. OK overall. Oh yea, if you travel make sure to get a converter or else it will blow up!</li>
    <li> Product is as described, working perfectly and was a speedy transaction.</li>
    <li> was a gift.  He liked it.</li>
    <li> Perhaps the best clippers I have ever used in the past the twenty years of actively using clippers several times a week.</li>
    <li> I am taking a moment to say this shaver is excellent. I use it to trim my beard and give myself haircuts..it is perfect in every sense. I highly recommend this unit for someone that travels a lot and does not have time for haircuts.</li>
    <li> I love this product I bought it for my husband since his trimmer was awful. This trimmer has great battery power and cuts clean and precise. The only thing I did not like was the guide any hair you cut with the guide on gets trapped in the guide and you have to continuously dig it out. Not a major problem but a small inconvenience.</li>
    <li> The voltage of my home is 220 while the voltage of the device is 120 .&lt;br /&gt;panasonic was supposed to tell us that in its device discription at amazon website.</li>
    <li> Worked like I wanted.</li>
    <li> This is good for body hair but not trimming your beard.  The smaller blade rips your hair out and doesnt cut even after following the cleaning before and after instructions.  This is good for cutting your hair on your head and trimming body hair but NOT facial.</li>
    <li> It does a job well and easy to clean. Good price!</li>
    <li> My husband already had one which he loves so we bought one for our son as a gift. It was perfect.</li>
    <li> Great clippers!  They cut smooth and the adjustment locks when you turn them on, so you don&#x27;t start cutting on setting 5 and finish on setting1!  The comb comes off, but it looks like it could break if you yank and pull. If you push it off from behind it works fine. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best unit on the market if you like your beard short.</li>
    <li> Verdict day one - NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO******************Wasted my money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought of waiting a few days before really posting my comment...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict today - Keep away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS -&lt;br /&gt;**Cordless. So need to be sure it is always charged before use. The other product I was using before this one had the corded and cordless option.&lt;br /&gt;**Not getting a uniform cut even when using at the &#x27;1&#x27; setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried various products over the years and always trim my beard rather than a complete shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System was my all time favorite. But they stopped making this exact model and now what ever remains in the market sells for 10 times the original price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big disappointment Panasonic and I don&#x27;t want to bother returning this.</li>
    <li> I used this to shave my head (as a replacement for my Whal clippers). The blade felt very flimsy and it didn&#x27;t shave as closely as I would have liked. However, with this being said, if you don&#x27;t like a shave that&#x27;s too close to the skin, I think these would be perfect. Just not for me.</li>
    <li> Great wall mounted charger, if you have a well placed plug, no cords running around the countertop.  Love the adjustable height, locks setting in place once power turned on.  Another review commented on the guard being flimsy, I admit that in packing for a trip it did get damaged, now I remove before packing no problems since.  I found replacement from Panasonic for a few dollars without much problem.  Would recommend based upon design, price &amp; quality (have had over a year now).</li>
    <li> I had one of these for years. It served me well and worked better than anything else I have used. It finally took a hard drop and the top broke and rendered it useless. I figured that they were no longer made, until I stumbled across it while perusing Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It adjusts to your desired length, it holds a charge for a good while and it is very versatile.&lt;br /&gt;It simply works perfect.</li>
    <li> Nice precision clipper. I used it for various body hair for quite a while and was happy with it. I grew a beard recently and found it to be very useful. The variety of lengths you can dial in is amazing. Start much longer than you need and dial down until you get the perfect length for the job, I recommend.</li>
    <li> I have had several of these trimmers over the past years. I only use it \\&quot;dry\\&quot;, not in the shower, etc.&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, this trimmer does a nice job at trimming and shaping your beard, etc. The trim depth is easily adjustable and has 20 different settings. The pop up small trimmer is nice for smaller jobs like trimming the stash, getting those unsightly ear hairs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;However, I agree with other users that the cheap, flimsey plastic comb is a definite negative. The plastic comb needs to be removed to use the pop up trimmer. The action of removing it and reinstalling it leaves it prone to breakage. When it breaks, good luck getting help from Panasonic. I have tried calling them several times to get a replacement comb. They list a \\&quot;replacement comb\\&quot; on the parts list, but it is not clear if this is the right part for this trimmer. When you call them, the customer service people do not know if this is the right part either. From here, you are transfered to an endless loop of unhelpful people. After spending over an hour on the phone one day, I resorted to super gluing the broken comb. This works for a while, but unless you are super careful, the comb will break again.</li>
    <li> Have to re-evaluate because the plastic teeth broke off while packed in my carry on luggage last night. The unit itself has worked well until this happened. I realize it&#x27;s a cheap appliance, but cheap is expensive when it only works for a few months! :(</li>
    <li> Great, inexpensive option to keep my head clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great shaver. I owned one for 6-7 years and the battery just gave out. I plan buying one again. You can use it while it&#x27;s plugged in. It works great in the shower. It&#x27;s super easy to clean. The head adjustments work well. My only complaint about this unit is it doesn&#x27;t get super close. If you plan on using it to trim a beard, goatee or &amp;#34;man-scaping&amp;#34; it will live stubble you&#x27;ll have to break out a razor for and the blades are not very forgiving on skin.</li>
    <li> Nice hair trimmer unit. It does a good job and holds a charge for a long time. Easy to clean and handle.</li>
    <li> A nicely designed trimmer.  Read the manual - it has features that you may not notice without doing so, like the micro trimmer hidden under the trim comb.  This trims hair efficiently and evenly, and with the micro-trimmer, does a great job on mustaches and (sigh) ear hair.</li>
    <li> Did not cut evenly and the motor would slow down when I would shave my head. I&#x27;m bald on the top and front of head. I also don&#x27;t let my hair grow more than an inch, and the trimmer would bog down with that little bit of hair. It also doesn&#x27;t cut close and leaves the hair uneven, on my face as well. The guard on the unit is flimsy and difficult to remove from the trimmer. I have been shaving my head for 20 years, I hqve also cut amd trim friends and my families hair and this trimmer doesn&#x27;t do what I need. The idea and premise is great, however this unit doesn&#x27;t work for me and can actually hurt a littlebit during use.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it for hair trimming and beard trimming.  Can get really close, but sometimes pulls beard hairs and hurts.  Works best on full charge. Mostly use it in the shower and haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
    <li> Very good, battery life is unbelievable</li>
    <li> Before I bought this trimmer I have been using a Panasonic ER508 trimmer for eight years.  It worked really well.  But the battery was starting to fail and I could not open the unit to change the battery.  So I decided to buy another Panasonic, this ER224S.  It turned out to be an absolute disaster.  The motor on ER224S is grossly under powered.  My eight year-oldER508 with a fading battery has more cutting power than this new ER224S.  Besides, the attachment was so badly designed that the hair keeps on getting jammed in it and I have to pull the attachment out every few SECONDS to clear out the hair.  I am really surprised that Panasonic marketed such a poorly designed product after a previous decent one.</li>
    <li> it is a great little machine</li>
    <li> For $20, this product is a good deal.  The trimmer runs smoothly and doesn&#x27;t tug or pull at my beard as some others have in the past.  The only complaint I have is that the guard is a little difficult to pull off when I just want to use the small mustache trimmer...always feels like I am going to break it.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The battery in my first one wore out after 4+ years, but when it was time to replace it this still seems the best option out there, particular given the convenience of being able to store/use this in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is what $20 buys: it&#x27;s nothing special but it&#x27;ll do the trick.</li>
    <li> Amazing tool for all purposes. Works wet and dry. For beard and hair. Wireless. Heavy duty and Panasonic&#x27;s high quality.</li>
    <li> Not holding a change very well, need to charge after sitting for a week or so.</li>
    <li> It does it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, look no further for a proper close shave: http://amzn.com/B0050HO9MI</li>
    <li> This system cuts well and cleans easy. You just have to run the blade under water. The only problem is that the guide is not made well. Mine cracked in about four months.</li>
    <li> It is working as expected. However, it is hard to take attachment off and I feel it is very easy to break it... Guess it is better to have 2 trimmers - one is attachment off all time...</li>
    <li> easy to use and does the job but the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; is hard to remove and I fear that the &amp;#34;release&amp;#34; will wear out</li>
    <li> This was a gift for someone who had the model before this one.  He is very particular about his beard and seems very pleased.</li>
    <li> My second pair, first pair lasted about 10 years. Keeps charge for about 5 trims, fast blade speed, stays lubed and sharp. Excellent buy.</li>
    <li> As far as I know, there aren&#x27;t many products comparable to this, in particular the numerical cutting length adjustment wheel.  I use it at setting 5 (about 1/8&amp;#34;) to keep my nearly bald head looking neatly trimmed.  Battery life is very good.  This is my second trimmer; the first lasted a long time.  The trimmer&#x27;s only shortcoming is the extremely flimsy sliding grooming cover, which must be removed at least once with each use.  I expect it to eventually crack like the first one I owned, but luckily a replacement can be purchased online.</li>
    <li> This trimmer looked awesome when i first got it, but from the first glance, it looked it was made from cheap plastic, the attachment comb was absolutely fragile. i was really careful when using it, i knew it would break, which happened after 20 use or something, the attachment comb broke in 2 pieces, however, before it breaks it was trimming very nicely, very sharp, i would have loved a bit more power , but it is good overall .</li>
    <li> I decided to write this review because one of the top reviews on these clippers shows an easily broken guard. I&#x27;ve been using mine for two years now and the guard is still in one piece. Of course I haven&#x27;t dropped them or used them to ward off any intruders, which is the only way I see enough force ever being exerted on the guard to cause breakage. That being said I&#x27;m about to order my second clipper because the battery is finally giving up the ghost. After two years I have to say I&#x27;ve gotten more life out of these than any other cordless clippers I&#x27;ve ever used though! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Hubby did not like it. I returned it and got a new one.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these, after the first lasted me around a decade. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it. I really like the adjustable guard. I broke it towards the end of the life of my old unit, but you can buy replacements cheaply. On this one I&#x27;ve naturally been more ginger, and had no problems. It works well either wet or dry.</li>
    <li> If you want to spend all day going over the same spot you&#x27;ll love this piece of crap.</li>
    <li> Comb could be made of a more durable material---Very, Very-- easy to break!</li>
    <li> On time and as described</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second one.&lt;br /&gt;(First one died after 8 years.)&lt;br /&gt;It has everything I need.&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Also love the small trimmer to get the tight spots.</li>
    <li> Worked okay, but the plastic guard broke. I figured I must have abused it, so I bought another (they&#x27;re cheap!), but after a couple of weeks its guard broke as well. If they fixed this, it would be a great product. As it stands, it&#x27;s pretty much useless.</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer since March 7.  When it arrived I charged it for 8 hours - I used it 4 times on that charge and as it appeared to be running low I plugged it in - at that point it was past the 30 day return.  I have tried over and over to charge it, and this unit is dead.  Totally dead.  The red charge light comes on, never charges.  I now get to toss this $20 in the trash.  Test this over and over - drain and charge etc before your 30 day to return it is up.</li>
    <li> Awesome purchase. Everything i wanted .</li>
    <li> I use it to shave my husbands head and it works great!!!!  The cordless feature sold me on the shaver.  It is very light and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Had one and the guide broke after a couple months. I decided maybe just a fluke so I figured I would purchase a second one. Not even one week while I was traveling on business it broke in the same exact place. I still use them when I need a haircut but not on the goatee. Very bad engineering on the guide for the trimmer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works on hair, but for beards, it&#x27;s useless.  the only setting that cuts is #1, all the other settings are useless, at least for a short beard.  it&#x27;s not at all what I expected.  clumsy and poorly conceived</li>
    <li> As others have stated, the comb is flimsy and I think poorly designed.  Once the comb is broken, you are out of luck.  Get something else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my beard a couple of times now and my girlfriend has cut my hair with it. Does a great job on both instances. Easy to clean as well. My one complaint is that the guard seems to be a little bit cheaply made at the point where it connects to the clipper, so I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to break it one of these times taking it off. Also it takes quite a while to charge, but not a real big deal.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  Really easy to switch lengths.  No cord to get in the way.  It also gets really really short, almost completely bald, on its lowest setting.  Be a little careful with the plastic piece at the top though.  It can crack if you drop this or bang it against something too hard.</li>
    <li> The fact that I do not have to change from one comb to another is a great design feature of Panasonic ER224S among others.&lt;br /&gt;I cut my hair with comfort. Great product.</li>
    <li> I was attracted by the design concept; turn the dial and change the cut depth.  This negates the 8 different guards clattering around a drawer or basket.  Two trips to the Barber Shop, and it pays off.  It&#x27;s great for thinning-hair guys who trim everything in 5 minutes with minimal tapering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The model I tried was a flop; the guard comb split apart almost a month into use, by falling onto the bathroom counter.  Gluing it back bought me another two months; customer service was non-existent.  Panasonic/National makes GREAT shavers, with high RPM motors and sharp blades, but they fell down here, big time.  I hope the make some improvements to the guard, making it from a more flexible HDPE.</li>
    <li> Everyone has bought a crappy Conair clippers before. Either they make too much noise or they pull hairs out of the root. This one is slim, quiet and cuts well. There&#x27;s no need to keep changing clips or losing them. It&#x27;s cordless and washable and says charged on the wall</li>
    <li> I have had a beard for over 35 years and have had varied success in shavers and beard trimmers.  My goal has been to find a shaver that does not have a lot of attachments which are a pain to keep track of especially when a case is not provided.  This Panasonic razor is a little bulky, but has some great features.  The adjustable length head has a wide range and the adjustment wheel locks in place when the razor is turned on.  The power is great and lasts for 5 shaves of 20 - 30 minutes each before needing a recharge!  The extra pop up trimmer is great for the ears and detail work.  It seems easy to clean, but I wish it had blades you didn&#x27;t need to oil every so often.  The negatives; Taking off the head to use the main trimmer or the pop up is tough.  You need to pull fairly hard.  I worry about squeezing it or cracxking it in the process.  The main trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut very close around the neck and so the pop up finishes it off, but a little goofy.  Over all I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for more than a month, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.  I haven&#x27;t had the issue with the guard breaking, though I also haven&#x27;t been using it with any real force either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tiny brush that comes with the shaver is just long enough to get the device cleaned up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other trimmers that have vacuums and this one doesn&#x27;t need one.</li>
    <li> simple and effective trimmer that does the job.  Really like the wall/outlet mounted charger.  Seems durable enough and the price was right.</li>
    <li> I was able to charge the battery for the trimmer only once. Charged for more than 24 hours after running down the battery, and the trimmer is dead. I returned the first shipment for exactly this reason, and now I&#x27;m told I&#x27;m too late to return the replacement that was also defective. This should be marketed as a disposable trimmer as the battery won&#x27;t ever recharge. $20 wasted.</li>
    <li> Plastic head broke 3 times already.</li>
    <li> the instruction sheet is terrible. it doesn&#x27;t tell you how to remove the trimmer adjuster for the closest trim. I have to pull it off by brute force. so far it hasn&#x27;t broken after a few months of use. if the battery dies you cannot use the adapter/charger to use the trimmer. no battery, no trimmer.</li>
    <li> Great product!  The fact that it&#x27;s waterproof makes it easy to use with shaving cream or in the shower and, it&#x27;s so easy to clean.  It&#x27;s also cordless with great battery life.... I can shave the entire week without a recharge (but that will depend on you and your style of beard).  And, it&#x27;s ultimately quiet, just a comfortable &amp;#34;hum&amp;#34;.  I use it for the &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; look and am quite satisfied.  Have not used it for hair cutting, but the adjustable comb is made well, calibrated, and sturdy, appearing to be easy to use.  This is a very well made, comfortable to hold product. I have absolutely no reservations about recommending this all-in-one!</li>
    <li> comp breaks, then ur scr*wed. buy something else. disappointed by panasonic on this one.</li>
    <li> It works much better dry than wet.  I use it to cut my hair since I&#x27;m in the military and have only a little hair left on top anyway.  It takes some work to get my hair cut evenly when I&#x27;m doing it myself.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and the battery lasts long enough to get my hair cut.  It paid for itself in just a few uses, since a hair cut was usually $10-$15.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE AND PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer.  I received it quickly and have used it numerous times.  It&#x27;s fairly easy to clean, though you do have to remove the plastic guard to clean effectively and when adding oil to the blade.  It is very effective and I am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best trimmer I have ever owned. Charge lasts well over an hour of continuous use. Easy to set trim lengths with a simple twist of the dial (1-12): no more lost length clip-ons or having to fuss with those. Fast and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the same experience as many others with this shaver. The guard is very thin plastic that, by design, must be forcefully removed from the shaver with a fairly hard pull. Mine lasted a few months prior to breaking. The whole case is actually a thin plastic that will not withstand any sort of impact whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all fairness, I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the shaver prior to the guard breaking. Because it is so bulky, it&#x27;s impossible to use the guard on the upper portion of my mustache, just below the nose. I realize there is a pop up trimmer but I don&#x27;t want to freehand an area that is uniform elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first waterproof shaver I&#x27;ve purchased and will be the last unless it just happens to be an added feature. I found it impossible to get any kind of even cut (face or head) with wet hair. I had hoped it would replace a beard/stache trimmer and a separate hair trimmer. In fact. the only thing I&#x27;ve been able to use it for with any level of satisfaction has been my chin. It&#x27;s too large for full face use and too small for use on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the Panasonic ER224 is poorly designed and made. I would not recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I love the all-in-one aspect of this! Quality is solid! Ergonomics are great! Love having the ability to adjust it to any desired length while not keeping track of 20 attachments like other comparable trimmers. I would recommend this item to anybody. Panasonic has designed a great product here. I use it often to trim my own nogan, about once a month as well as my mug a couple times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only frustration is that I&#x27;ve gone through 3 of them in the past 6 years because the rechargeable battery diminishes after so many charges and discharges. After the first one died I was pretty careful the second time around with battery maintenance; not overcharging and letting it completely die before recharging. Getting ready to purchase my 4th one because there is nothing comparable on the market in terms of quality or features; not to mention price. Please Panasonic - fix the battery quality of these. I would be willing to may another $10-$20 for a better quality battery that has a longer lifespan. Or even the ability to replace the battery alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5-stars if the battery was better, otherwise this is the best trimmer in the market - probably in a class of it&#x27;s own for its list of features.</li>
    <li> I had one of these before and it worked great to shave and fix my beard.  It is great and the best thing is that you can clean it with water so it can get wet and then be utilized again.</li>
    <li> Trims, cuts, some others mentioned problems with the guard, I&#x27;ve used it for several months with no problems, never runs out of power.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband after seeing it at the Art of Shaving. It works great to keep the stubble and keeps a charge for a long time. Great tool for the price.</li>
    <li> Works just like you would want it to. Very easy to use and battery lasts a long time and charges easily</li>
    <li> the product is good and easy to use .it is strong and perfect in use .i advice every one to buy it and enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> I bought the trimmer in order to cut my children’s&#x27; hair. Needless to say, it did not succeed.&lt;br /&gt;It was unable to cut their hair. After 5 pass throughs I gave up....&lt;br /&gt;It clogged up within 30 seconds of use.&lt;br /&gt;I had no choice but to revert to my old corded shaver.&lt;br /&gt;This is nothing more than a cheap piece of plastic and an under-powered motor.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and purchase something else....</li>
    <li> I have owned the same trimmer for several years and the battery did not hold a charge anymore. I was very happy with the last one so I wanted to replace it with one that I knew worked very good for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this one to replace a Phillips trimmer I previously had.  The Phillips trimmer worked great, but the plastic blade guard (also an on-board adjustable type) was too delicate, and in my travels, the plastic fingers of the blade guard easily broke after a few trips; I then learned a replacement on-board adjustable guard was more than this entire Panasonic trimmer.  This Panasonic trimmer is better than the Phillips trimmer in that cheaper (I paid $20 &amp; got free shipping) it is more durably constructed (waterproof, stronger blade guards, etc), and the single-piece charging unit for this Panasonic trimmer is more convenient than the plug &amp; cord type that comes with most other trimmers, like my old Phillips trimmer.  From my searching there is no perfect trimmer out there, but this is the best trimmer for me, I travel all the time, and this one is durable and gets the job done, and if it breaks... it was only $20 to begin with.  But if you&#x27;re just trimming at home and not traveling with your, check out the Phillips trimmers, which are about 3X the price, but charge faster and run faster (the Phillips model cuts hair about 30% faster than this one).</li>
    <li> Old one died had to get new one stores no longer carry this model witch served me perfect for over 5 years I may buy a few more to keep on hand I will be set for rest of my life</li>
    <li> Guard broke once... super glued but broke in another location. I gave up on it. A few more words to get 20</li>
    <li> This is my second unit, spanning five years. It&#x27;s a great tool but just don&#x27;t let it slip out of your hand when it&#x27;s wet. The integral trimming comb is breakable and without it, you&#x27;re done. Hence why I bought another...</li>
    <li> &#x27;Very good product. I really like it very mucho. I have previously used a similar product with more or less same quality.</li>
    <li> If you want it for shaving body, don&#x27;t buy it. Because it doesn&#x27;t shave a body well.</li>
    <li> There are many things I like a lot about the clipper. It holds a charge for a long time, the variable length settings are really great and easy to dial. And, though I have not used the clipper in a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; situation, I&#x27;m glad to know it is made to be used wet and so it doesn&#x27;t matter if it inadvertently gets wet. Also, the comb locks in place once the clipper is turned on so you won&#x27;t accidentally change the clipper setting in mid-use. However, the comb is difficult to remove (not impossible but just more effort than it should be). AND, and this is its biggest flaw, the comb breaks very easily. A simple drop on the floor was enough to break the comb. I ended up doing some research in my efforts to find a replacement comb and discovered that this was a very common complaint. (BTW, I did find a replacement comb at Shaver Outlet and ended up buying two, just to have a spare.) All in all I&#x27;m still happy with the clipper but wish that they&#x27;d redesign the way the comb attaches and that they&#x27;d use a more resilient material for the comb.</li>
    <li> GREAT SHOWER RESISTENT</li>
    <li> Works great for a quick haircut the only downside is that the plastic comb is a little flimsy and feels like it can break when i take it off to clean it out.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver.  I had the exact same one before but it died after 5 minutes of use.  This one is doing great so far.</li>
    <li> works well this one replaces the one i broke.</li>
    <li> My wife bought me my first ER224S as a gift several years ago.  As my sons grew into young men, they began using my trimmer as well.  I bought a 2nd one - relinquishing the original to their use - so that I could have my own trimmer again.  I&#x27;m going to order a 3rd ER224S as a gift to my son departing for college!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! It has a ton of different lengths and a decent foil shaver. The only issue with this trimmer for me is I only use it for my beard so the width is not as necessary. But all in all this is the best trimmer I have ever used!!!</li>
    <li> Its pretty good for the amount paid...&lt;br /&gt;its durable and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Works good for the clipping hair as well.</li>
    <li> Well I bought this and was in love at first !! I left great reviews on this before on another site.  After owning this for 4 months it stopped working and would not hold a charge. Had to toss it out. Also the guard broke after 2 months and had to buy a new one for around 9.00 I think.  If panasonic could make another one with a option of having it corded and a better battery, it would be the best out there period.</li>
    <li> I love it works great, one flaw.... When you change the numbers for the leneghth you want it to trim, well you have like (1|3|4|6 ...) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So one time I left it at 11, but didnt realize i pushed it down (the top).... well it went to 1, and i could see the 1 and the line so I figured it was fine, well guess what, I lost my beard LOL...... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They could have made it more user friendly, but once you screw up once you realize never to do it again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;otherwise works great!  Wish there was a catcher for all the trimmed hair :-) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kosher1</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is so nice not to have to concern myself with all the different combs that have to be changed with a regular hair cutting instrument</li>
    <li> The shaver has an overall Panasonic attractiveness. &lt;br /&gt;I hve owned previous similar models and all were first rate in quality. &lt;br /&gt;In fact the most recent lasted YEARS.. i even replaced the batteries which were technically not replaceable because i did not want to let it die. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is one major drawback to this shaver.  The cutting head is not at the frontmost position when you have the guard on.  Meaning if you are shaving tight curves on your body then it actually does not perform well since the shaving head is at mid point inside the plastic guard.  I think this flaw is a major one but i do use it still, considering.  Otherwise the water repellant build and battery life/looks/performance is fine.  I do orry about the flimsy plastic guard and the seemingly flimsy notch that holds the height position.  So far it has not failed but it could be a BIG BIG problem if you are shaving and it pops to a lower position suddenly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recommend this but i also expect more from Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I use the hair trimmer only for close cutting around the back neck area, and the hair trimmer did a great job. I loved being without the hassel of an electric cord, too.</li>
    <li> This is overall a great product. Does everything very well at a good price. Seems quite reliable too.</li>
    <li> As usual very good quality in a Panasonic product. This is the second unit in the past 7 years and again the same good quality in this product.</li>
    <li> I am have been using Panasonic Hair and Bear Trimmer over 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;This is quite reliable product.&lt;br /&gt;Keep It up!</li>
    <li> I had this shaver for some years, but I apparently left the charger in a hotel room somewhere.  Since it was several years old I never thought I could find the same one again.  In the course of deciding on a new shaver, I tried several.  None had the comfortable feel and adjustable features of my old ER224S.  One seemed to be pulling my beard out rather than cutting it. Then I had the brilliant idea of checking Amazon to see if I could buy a charger for my ER224S.&lt;br /&gt;Not only did I find the charger on Amazon, I found that for a very few dollars more I could buy the whole kit including the shaver.  If I had one concern about my old ER224S it was that after years of use the motor seemed to be slowing down a bit.  For about $20 I have a brand new shaver that does a better job than any of those that I tested.</li>
    <li> The first time you use it watch to see how close the blade is to the attachment when you change the setting. You can judge better which is best when you see how close it cuts at each setting. When I first tried it, it didn&#x27;t seem to be cutting so I set the dial lower Then I accidentally changed the angle I was cutting at and BAM... too close. It grows back, but this problem can be easily avoided.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll tell you frankly the flowbee works better but it&#x27;s a pain to set it up and this is much more convenient and works well when you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt; I had poor results when I tried it on my head hair The flowbee works much better there.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer for it&#x27;s money.</li>
    <li> The last beard trimmer I will ever buy.  The built in adjuster setting works great and you don&#x27;t have to worry about extra pieces.</li>
    <li> So when I lost my first charging cord to my original Panasonic ER224S, it was only a $5 difference just to order another shaver.  What always drove me crazy about other trimmers were always losing the different pieces that they come with.  This one is super simple with many different levels and is pretty powerful as well.  Only downside is if your trying to trim your mustache, it&#x27;s hard to get directly under the nose because of how broad the blade setup is.  All in all you can make it work and that is the only reason I took off a star.</li>
    <li> It works fine but the attachment broke after using for about 2 months.  I am trying now to get a replacement.  I shall change it to 4 stars when I get a replacement for that part.</li>
    <li> Overall a good trimmer. Pop-up trimmer is very precise and useful. Lasted me quite a while of regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars because the comb is not well designed, breaks easily as shown in other reviews, somewhat difficult to put back on, and removal stresses the weak joints on the edges. Broke one side of the comb, glued it and used it for a bit, then the other side broke. Redesign the comb and you have yourself a great trimmer.</li>
    <li> If it ever breaks I&#x27;ll keep buying it. Super effective, good power, good battery, use it on my head, and I don&#x27;t just do a basic trim.</li>
    <li> nice product, good quality and works very good.</li>
    <li> Works great but plastic trim comb is a little flimsy. I chose this over some newer models as it doesn&#x27;t need oiling on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Used it and I love the new feature of adjusting the blade with just 1 click up or down. Easy to use and cuts really nice.</li>
    <li> Light, strong, does everything it is expected of and the bonus is that you can rinse the blade with water, wich saves me some cleaning steps if I compare to the Noreclo I also have.</li>
    <li> Underpowered. At full charge it would not make a complete cut after numerous passes. Had to finish with a previous clipper that I have to plug in after many years of use.</li>
    <li> Just really appricitae having everything at my finger tips no added clips needed</li>
    <li> great quality and ease of use</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get it. Build quality was terrible, and it did not have enough power to go through my hair. There are better options available on Amazon in the same price range.</li>
    <li> Bought it to buzz my baby&#x27;s hair, works great!</li>
    <li> Shaver&#x27;s fine, comb is crap.  As you&#x27;ll see from plenty of other reviewers, it&#x27;s made of very flimsy and apparently extremely brittle plastic.  Having read the warnings I figured i would just be extra careful.  Didn&#x27;t matter.  Given the number of times you&#x27;ll have to remove the comb to clean, you WILL break it.  You WILL need to get a replacement.  But don&#x27;t worry - Panasonic expects this.  I feel like paraphrasing Woody Allen in &amp;#34;Annie Hall&amp;#34; - their replacement parts are equally bad AND what&#x27;s more, they&#x27;re on back order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not a bug, it&#x27;s a feature.</li>
    <li> Worked great on my husband&#x27;s beard.&lt;br /&gt;The unique turn knob to adjust the height of the razor was very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing like juggling the usual adapters to these kinds of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;The charging station is great and puts the trimmer right where you need it (it&#x27;s in our kitchen but if you have a better electrical system in your home then you&#x27;ll be pleased to have this right where you want it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pleasantly pleased with the quality at a great price.</li>
    <li> My third purchase of the same device. I cut my hair weekly: Two cuts &amp; I beak even with the cost of my local barber, so it pays for its&#x27; self quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first, back when I had a beard, then a goatee. Very easy to use and kept the facial hair neat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for a year now, and the battery life is significantly lower than when new.  I would estimate that it is 50% of what it was new.  I&#x27;ve had electric razors in the past, and they don&#x27;t lose so much power.  I literally struggle to trim my sideburns with it before the battery gives out.  One other thing I&#x27;ve noticed - the gray length adjustment guides are designed to act as a cage which traps your hair inside rather than letting it fall freely out as you trim.  The result is that the blades spend more time re-trimming hair that you&#x27;ve already cut, and less time cutting the hair you want to get rid of.  Save your money and find something else.</li>
    <li> This was my first beard trimmer. All in all, not bad, but two years after purchase the battery is dying and it won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than few uses. Unfortunately, it only charges on the plug in cradle/stand, so with no cord or replaceable battery, that means it&#x27;s pretty much game over once the battery starts to go. I personally never use it in the shower as my beard becomes quite soft when wet, and I feel a beard trimmer works best when my whiskers are dry. That said, it is nice to get a waterproof one in case you drop it in the sink….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking for a new beard trimmer now, and even though these are still available, I&#x27;m looking elsewhere. The plastic comb is pretty flimsy, and I never liked how easy it was accidentally change the depth setting--more than a few times I accidentally trimmed waaaay too short because I didn&#x27;t check the trim setting first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in the future I won&#x27;t buy a trimmer that you can&#x27;t use with the cord, nor one where the trim setting doesn&#x27;t have some sort of locking feature. I only paid $25 for it, and it last 2 years, but I&#x27;ll pass on getting another one.</li>
    <li> A good hair and beard trimmer for the money, and seems to be sturdy. Previous trimmer plastic trim guard fell apart after only a year of use.</li>
    <li> VERY HANDY CHARGER....NO CORD.....WIDE ADJUSTMENT RANGE AND VERY QUIET....  EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE</li>
    <li> use it to shave my beard, head, works great.</li>
    <li> Decent item for beard trimming, but cutting hair is hard. The attachment is flimsy and flexible, which is actually good for facial hair but when it is used on thick hair on head, it tends to give way and feel like you&#x27;re cutting at inconsistent lengths.</li>
    <li> i purchase this to trim body hair on my arms and lets etc.  It just doesn&#x27;t allow me to cut as close as I wanted to.  Now if I could buy another attachment for this purpose I would be very happy.</li>
    <li> Very well designed, with a large range of adjustments. The &#x27;rake&#x27; is not easy to remove, or at least I haven&#x27;t figured out the trick of doing it, But no matter. It&#x27;s still a good product, and it holds its charge well.</li>
    <li> Poor and a. Waste of money. Does not live up to their claims</li>
    <li> Bought my first about 10 years ago, why fix something that isn&#x27;t broke? After 10 years of using this on my head and face it was still going strong, however the blades were dulling and I broke the clip for cutting hair. Was thrilled they still sold the model it is perfect.</li>
    <li> At least it is functional (as opposed to their &#x27;turbo&#x27; model which is non-functional).  Does the cutting job pretty well.  But it is difficult to remove the guard for emptying. You have to shut down the machine first, can&#x27;t do it &#x27;on the fly&#x27;.  I guess this is a new safety issue?  Then when you put it back on, you have to reset your number again - it does not return to the previous position.</li>
    <li> My husband loves them.  Hasn&#x27;t paid for a haircut in 8 years.  This is his second set and the battery is better on the newer model.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver ,ive had better for smoother trimming at finest setting but not for the price. Super quiet as well.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a good charge too. If it fine trimmed as smooth as my istubble, it would have got 5 stars but I stubble was twice the price</li>
    <li> This Trimmer didnt last long.. althought it did work well while it lasted.. I would not purchase another one in the future.</li>
    <li> It is handy and useful  for moderate hair clipping and grooming.</li>
    <li> My husband is military and uses this twice per week giving himself a haircut (yes, he does fades and all by himself). It adjusts easily and can get wet in the shower.  Perfect.  He even had it with him in Afghanistan and all was well.  A new trimmer lasts him about a year to a year and a half because he uses it so much.  We are fine with that because it performs well and is well used.</li>
    <li> I like the design and ease of use, but product quality is sub-par.  I only use it to trim my goatee about twice a month.  After 3 months it quit working completely.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is the best for the guy on the go.  Set to the length you want and just get after it - just remember to double check the setting!  I keep my beard at a professional length (think Al from the show Home Improvement), and that&#x27;s on the longest setting so this isn&#x27;t for long beards.  I&#x27;ve actually purchased this one twice.  The first wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge after about two years but I loved this trimmer so much I got another one and nothing has changed on it.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. My husband uses it weekly in the shower to do his beard. We have had it for 6 months with no problems. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This beard trimmer has been a welcome relief from my experience using other products.  It does a great job, and the extension trimmer is very useful.  While it takes a long time to charge, it lasts for an equally long time in standby.  Well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> How to replace blade, plastic guard and other spare parts? The rating by me is not official, I will rate later</li>
    <li> I use this trimmer quiet often. It holds its charge and never have any issues with it pulling due to dull cutters. Never used it wet though.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had any of the trouble listed in other reviews. I use it for trimming of &amp;#34;personal areas&amp;#34; and it works great!</li>
    <li> I can imagine a better solution, but I haven&#x27;t found it for less than $30 bucks.  for the price I think this is perfectly adequate.</li>
    <li> The clippers are great. But the guide over the end is frail and has already cracked. bad design on it</li>
    <li> It works great, the charge doesn&#x27;t last too long when you are buzzing your entire head, but its cheap so that&#x27;s expected I suppose.  The only issue I really have is trying to use the plastic guard but on the lowest setting.  Its tough to get some places with that plastic guard on and that&#x27;s the only thing stopping the blade from hitting any sensitive areas on your body.</li>
    <li> The plastic guide/comb is incredibly cheap/brittle and/or flimsy.  After only a few uses it has cracked which essentially makes the trimmer worthless.  Several reviewers have commented in regards to the same issue, Panasonic should be ashamed and recall this poorly designed device!</li>
    <li> I was quite dissatisfied. Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. I had to purchase another brand for a more precise cutting.</li>
    <li> Had this trimmer for years.  Love it.  Does a great job on cleaning up the beard tight, my sin has one and my daughter bought for the boyfriend. She will actually be giving haircuts with it.  Haven&#x27;t done that, but very happy with the beard trimming.  Charge about once a month.</li>
    <li> Generally this is very good product and very good price, in other words good idea with stupid realisation.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving only two stars because of manufacturer&#x27;s stupidity or more likely cunning,&lt;br /&gt;why don&#x27;t make it with worldwide voltage or with possibility of easy recharble battery replacement,&lt;br /&gt;finally, when the manufacturers STOP changing plug connections, this one is different from my previous Panasonic shaver&lt;br /&gt;and I think all other their shavers, also I don&#x27;t like type of adaptor supplied.</li>
    <li> This Panasonic clipper, which I use weekly to keep my scalp buzzed very close (#2), is comfortable to hold, has a nice wide head for quick clipping, it very quiet, and holds a charge for maybe 6, five minute uses.  It&#x27;s Achilles heel is the comb -- brittle, fragile, very prone to breaking.  Consequently, I never take the comb off to clean the clipper, instead using the enclosed small brush to clean it during each use.  I have ordered replacement comb heads, since carrying it in a suitcase on a trip has broken it in the past.  Other than this weakness, I&#x27;d recommend the clipper to anyone, although I&#x27;ve never used it for a beard.</li>
    <li> The way the cover is designed it is impossible to get close to an edge.&lt;br /&gt;For example the top of the ear, you can not go up or down it, you have to go across.&lt;br /&gt;I use these for my beard too. Impossible to trim under the nose.</li>
    <li> I bought a new one to replace my old one that lasted for 8 years. The old one still worked but the battery would only hold a charge long enough to get through a trim - barely. Batteries just don&#x27;t last. However, the trimmer did so I bought the exact same model that I did years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a related note, there were several reviews that said the guide is fragile or delicate - that hasn&#x27;t been my experience. I&#x27;ve never been gentle with my trimmer over the 8 years I&#x27;ve owned them (dropping from height onto a steel tub, tile, pit of lava) and mine has never broken. Maybe they got a bad batch of plastic? Either way I wouldn&#x27;t let those reviews sway you - this is a great trimmer.</li>
    <li> recently purchased this to replace an aging one. sturdy piece, well built. the all-in-one makes it great for traveling. .</li>
    <li> bought this trimmer because it seemed like the best value for the $. I was not dissapointed. It glides over your beard like a sled on snow. gives a very smooth cut and more importantly, does not snag or gouge.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative comment is the length adjustment does not stay fixed. If you press too hard, it retracts, resulting in cuting your beard too short.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would reccomend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY HAL</li>
    <li> I read reviews of this product stating that the plastic guard that adjusts the length of the cut is prone to breaking but I thought I could caress it and make it last.  I generally don&#x27;t break prodocts in normal use.  This trimmer is the exception.  It will break, just give it a little time.  One drop, maybe one too many times taking if off for a close shave or cleaning.  Either way, that little piece of junk (the guard/comb) is made of very weak plastic and will break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My history with this product:&lt;br /&gt;1st, I loved it!  Works great!  Adjustable!  I use it everywhere!  Whoops, why did that just brake?  Hmmmm, I guess I&#x27;ll find a replacement part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd, I bought another one exactly the same.  My plan this time was to use one without the guard for close shaving and use the second one for adjustable cutting.  That way, I&#x27;d rarely have to remove the guard which stresses it and then surely it would last.  Doh!!! That one broke too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with two shavers and no guard, I ordered 2 replacement guards from Panasonic.  Ok, one year later... both of those are now broken too.  Yes, I glued them, epoxied them, and gorilla glued them again!  The glue won&#x27;t even work with these things.  Sooooooooooo..... just don&#x27;t order one.  Do yourself a favor and spend a little more to find one that isn&#x27;t designed to destruct.  Too bad, would have otherwise been a great product.  Couple extra pennies spent by Panasonic to find an alternative sturdy plastic would easily solve this issue.  Anyone know someone who could machine a replacement part for me?  Maybe whittle one out of wood?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fault for ignoring the warnings.  Don&#x27;t do like I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just posting an update (10/25/12):  Just ordered and received 3 more replacement combs from Panasonic...  Maybe because I&#x27;m a sucker or maybe because I couldn&#x27;t stand to waste 2 working shavers because the combs were broke again.  In case you need a comb, here is the part number and price at the time I wrote this on Panasonic site:  WER224S7398 - COMB - $1.45 (cheap)&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Not worth it. ! The plastic attached comb is made with very  thin and cheap material and it brakes just &amp;#34;looking at it&amp;#34;.I am very disappointed  with this Panasonic product.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;s great for trimming my &amp;#34;shaved&amp;#34; head and facial hair.</li>
    <li> i love this gadget...it works very well and i love the fact that i can use it in the shower with water&lt;br /&gt;i almost bought it from THE ART OF SHAVING  store and i am so glad i didnt because it was exactly double the price of what i got here on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;great product ...highly recommended</li>
    <li> Absolutely agree with other comments/complaints: great trimmer, would be perfect if it weren&#x27;t for the flimsy plastic comb, that inevitably breaks. I&#x27;ve bought replacements that broke as well - now it&#x27;s glued, but won&#x27;t hold for too long, with frequent removal to access the bare blade for trimming sideburns!&lt;br /&gt;Does anybody at Panasonic read this, surely they must get complaints and it&#x27;s puzzling that no one has done anything to improve the design, or use sturdier plastic!</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for about 12 years now.  Nothing fancy, just a relatively short buzz cut w/ a good blend around the crown of my skull.  Sides and back are cut shorter than I cut the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased one of these as I loved how close you could set the shaving head (1/16&amp;#34;).  Not many other shavers can get that close as most only go down to 1/8&amp;#34;.  That part, and the water repellant feature are very nice.  It holds a charge well, and will stay charged for several weeks if I charge it overnight and then end up not using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the down side...  I will usually go several weeks between hair cutting so when I do cut it, I end up taking 1/4&amp;#34; to 1/2&amp;#34; off.  The clippers are not &amp;#34;self-cleaning&amp;#34; during use.  Hair builds up under the guide and I need to stop and use a comb to &amp;#34;rake&amp;#34; it out or else it covers the blades and quits cutting my hair.  This is completely frustrating and has forced me to look for another set of cordless clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s not a bad set of clippers.  However, if you can afford more, and are willing to spend more, I think there are probably better clippers out there.  The hard part is going to be finding a set that gets down to 1/16&amp;#34;...</li>
    <li> This item does what it is supposed to do. what more can i really say about it.. it works well and does an excellent job for what it&#x27;s for. thank you</li>
    <li> I read reviews of others who had purchased this shaved as well as the information provided by the seller. I was looking for a shaver that would last longer than the Remington we have. I&#x27;ve used it to cut my husband&#x27;s hair and beard. (He has Alzheimer&#x27;s and can no longer shave himself.) Tonight was the first opportunity I had to use this Panasonic that is supposed to last 40 minutes on an 8 hour charge.  I dialed it to the shortest setting to cut his beard. Imagine my dismay when it barely made a dent in his beard. Though I kept trying it barely cut anything. Even though the Remington&#x27;s battery doesn&#x27;t last long it gets the job done. I&#x27;m hugely disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have, had a lot of trimmers and for last 10 yrs I have been trimming my hair. This is best value for money I ever got! Used it during 3 months no problems! i used it once every week. Unfortunately i came back to Europe and burned adapter as power in Europe plugs was too strong and I didnt check. Anyway when I go back to states or find this anywhere else I will buy it again!&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation!</li>
    <li> I Just Love it, very easy to use and Water proof too !</li>
    <li> Superb shaver--I use it for shaving body hair. I owned the same shaver for 5 years and was very satisfied; this one is wet &amp; dry. I highly recommend it, especially for its low price.</li>
    <li> This purchase was to replace my previous Panasonic of the same model. That one had lasted me somewhere in the 5-7 year timeframe. Considering the price and longevity in my experience this product is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When speaking about my previous Panasonic the only issues I&#x27;ve had were the removable plastic piece snapping on one corner (after about 5 years use), the occasional clogging within the trimmer itself (due to not keeping up with regular maintenance), and the eventual no power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s versatile enough to take care of trimming both my beard and body and I have no complaints at all.</li>
    <li> -packaging was clean and intact.&lt;br /&gt;-trimmer worked great.&lt;br /&gt;-a lot of length settings on the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;-i do however wish it had a vacuum feature to catch the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;-very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Solid unit well priced.</li>
    <li> My device just stopped working. It woudnt charge anymore and Now i cant return it. this is burning injustice. Kindly allow me to send it back and replace it with a new piece</li>
    <li> does what its supposed to, and the dial for adjusting trim length is handy, but there are some drawbacks. as others have mentioned, the plastic guard WILL eventually break if you remove it often, as i do, and more must be ordered from panasonic. also the battery is NOT lithium and will suffer from battery memory if you charge it before completely discharging, which is a recipe for problems since you may run out of charge mid-trim because you must wait for that to happen before recharging. lastly if you trim at closer lengths like me, you may find yourself stranded a bit where the length suddenly jumps up from very short to not so short</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought several kinds in the past and none did as good a job as this one. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He already had one, but didn&#x27;t like that the one he had couldn&#x27;t be taken in the shower, plus the trim would come out uneven. So I bought his this one. His beard is very even with every trim. It works well and he can take it in the shower. Also when it is charging, it&#x27;s off the counter and my daughter can&#x27;t knock it off the counter, accidentally, and break it...</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer because I was letting my beard grow.  It works very well.  I enjoy having an easy-to-use trimmer.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as made to believe.. Good trimmer for someone who doesn&#x27;t want a close facial trim good luck</li>
    <li> Before buying this model, I had a Panasonic black one (model R389) which performed very well. The battery had gone so I decided to be loyal to the brand, but, unfortunately, this new device is designed for breaking. The plastic guard is extremely flimsy. It broke after few uses and the battery doesn&#x27;t charge anymore. I&#x27;m very disapointed and looking for the former model in second hand markets...</li>
    <li> My husband loves it! He manscapes his beard and hair every week. No complaints on this brand of trimmer like other brands in the past. Hopeful that this product keeps going for a long time. So far, a good buy.</li>
    <li> Great quality and great performance, no problems until now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply, you can rely on it easily without complaining. Trust Panasonic!@#@@!</li>
    <li> Plastic comb attachment broke after 4 months and minimal use. I would trim my Gotee with it once every 1 to 2 weeks. Now after 4 months this plastic attachment has cracked and is broken. I&#x27;ve only have the trimmer attachment/guard off twice since I&#x27;ve had it. I was able to super glue it back together but I don&#x27;t know how long that will last.</li>
    <li> Holds charge for long enough. Super easy to use. Easy enough to clean. Does what I need it to do (cut the boyfriend&#x27;s hair)</li>
    <li> Love this razor! 3rd one I&#x27;ve bought over the last 5+ years.</li>
    <li> This is my second one.  The first one lasted about 6 years and then the plastic head broke.  The new one works but the charger does not indicate when it is fully charged.  Instructions say not to charge for more than 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good device that works and does not have a bunch of head that need changing.  6 years life cycle is o.k.</li>
    <li> great product this is my second one because my first one somebody used it to shave the dog. Anyways this item is awesome and I only use this product and have been using it for years. Thank you</li>
    <li> it has a smaller trim blade that gets in the way.</li>
    <li> I am a 52 year old man that has had a moustache and beard almost constantly since I graduated from High School in 1980. During that time I have obviously gone through a number of beard trimmers and, since my hair stated going, began using them to trim my remaining hair as well. (My motto is, &amp;#34;If it&#x27;s long enough to need coombing then it needs to be cut...&amp;#34; LOL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During all this time I have found the Panasonic ER224S to be the best beard and hair trimmer that I have ever used.  It is wide enough to get a good even trim on the legth of your beard.  The adjustable guide, which is numerically marked so you can use the same length each time, comes off easily for using the full size trimmer (which feels smoothe and not like a pair of edge clippers when trimming the back of youur nect) or the slide out smaller trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How many of you men have used a similarly designed adjustable length trimmer to trim your hair or beard and have the adjustable iece suddenly collapse on you leaving you with a swath of much shorter beard across your face? You won&#x27;t have that problem with this trimmer sincr the adjustment locks into place when the trimmer is turned on. This is the only trimmer that Ihve used that utilizes tht featre and does away with the need fr multiple size comb attachments to prevent this from hppening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the trimmer is designed and works better than any of the 15 or so trimmers that I have used over the course of the last 34 years.</li>
    <li> UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE THIN HAIR AND THIS CLIPPER DOESN&#x27;T CUT IT VERRY GOOD AT ALL.  I TRIED IT ON A FRIEND WITH THICKER HAIR AND IT CUT FINE.........</li>
    <li> Best hair trimmer I&#x27;ve had and can&#x27;t lose the combs.</li>
    <li> The most fun about shopping for this trimmer was the home video a fellow posted about it. It works just like he described it, even as a Star Trek phaser :)</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says, husband uses it in the shower at least once a week. Great time saver &amp; no messy hair on floor!</li>
    <li> I was not sure if this was the right trimmer for my needs but it was and it even was better than i expected. The item ship quickly and was delivered on the exact day i was advised it would arrive.</li>
    <li> Perfect trimmer. I love it! Only thing missing is a nose hair trimmer attachment.</li>
    <li> OK, so here is the deal. This clipper kinda works but has two problems that make it a return for me. 1. the motor slows down when it his any length of hair. I have very short hair and I keep it short, but the clipper just can&#x27;t cut through with any power. 2.  the one piece clipper attachment that is adjustable for different cutting lengths is a great idea BUT as you cut your hair, the clipped hair builds up inside the length adjuster and clogs up the works on this thing. You have to stop cutting, pull the damn thing off the clipper and dump out the clump of hair. You have to do this every few cutting strokes. So in conclusion, it is going back today and I am going to buy another cordless that is more expensive/powerful and has the standard removable clipper attachments.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer to replace a 10 year old Panasonic that was great. I am disappointed in the quality of the cut. After the first use, I looked at the ER224S and it is made in China.  I looked at my old trimmer (ER389), and it was made in Japan........enough said.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to be able to say &amp;#34;for the price, blah blah blah&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s not even the case here. If you&#x27;re thinking of ordering one of these to cut hair, don&#x27;t. The trim guard clogs constantly, and you have to spend an inordinate amount of time clearing it in order to get back to cutting. The cut is very uneven and going over the same spots over and over yields limited results. It&#x27;s a little better on beards, though with the coarser hair it&#x27;s a little grabby on occasion. Another admittedly small annoyance is that you can&#x27;t adjust the length of the cut while the trimmer is turned on, so you might find yourself turning it on &amp; off repeatedly. Given the option, you&#x27;re better off saving the $ and putting it towards a more high-quality trimmer.</li>
    <li> I do like this product as it held a charge for very very long time and performed flawlessly, until the guard broke. Mine took awhile, but it broke in a weird spot. I tried to glue it but even that wouldn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s weak guard design. Disappointed because I don&#x27;t want to buy a replacement for the simple reason that I think it might happen again.</li>
    <li> I have owned one of these trimmers before and ordered another one when the original was dropped and broken accidentally.  Does everything a trimmer should do.</li>
    <li> Great clipped. Actually purchased it in a brick and mortar first then got one for all the &amp;#34;gents&amp;#34; in the family For Christmas. Watch the video that is posted on the Amazon site. It is very helpful.  We hav e purchase many of these types of clippers over the years and this one is superior!</li>
    <li> Second one I buy, great product very well built. First one lasted 4 years and never a problem to use.</li>
    <li> Battery lasts long between charges.&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly and able to easily trim my beard and hair.</li>
    <li> this was a gift.  Not as easy to use as the previous models of Panasonic all in one clippers.  But still a good unit.</li>
    <li> Bought this 7-8 years ago use it for beard trimming have never oiled the blade it always gets wet and the thing still works great. wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Terrible and cheap! The blade guide bends when I try to clip my biracial toddler&#x27;s hair.  No matter how tangle free these clippers have a hard time cutting his hair.  It&#x27;s awful and now I&#x27;ve paid for these and still need to fork out cash for a proper trim.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this item - it is difficult to use and the closest shave setting (&#x27;1&amp;#34;) does not provide a close shave. I did some research prior to my purchase and believed I made a good choice; however, I am extremely disappointed. As this is a hair clipper and, thus not used on a frequent basis, I tried returning the item after only the 2nd use (to give it another try) and have lost the window of time to return the product. What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> This is the worse Panasonic product I&#x27;ve ever bought,this thing pulls you hair while cutting it,&lt;br /&gt;it is very difficult to handle, it&#x27;s made with a plastic glossy finish that slips off your hand,&lt;br /&gt;blades need oiling before and after each use,overall a very bad product.</li>
    <li> I think Panasonic has the best hair products but this one is too plastic and broke after just a couple of months use.</li>
    <li> This is good, good price. Works well. Oil it often. Only huge issue is removing the guard to use the shaper. Doesn&#x27;t come off easy and it breaks making it useless for trimming. Replacements are expensive due to shipping</li>
    <li> not great for taking off a lot of hair at one time as the comb/length adjustment piece clogs easily with whiskers if longer than an eighth of an inch, but okay for keeping the beard trimmed tight.  Would not recommend this for any serious hair cutting--fairly light duty. cordless is nice as is wet dry use although wet cutting only makes the clogging problem worse.  you have to pull the whole comb/cover off to really rinse out the whiskers.  Tries to be good at a lot of different jobs but ends up being at best mediocre at all of them.</li>
    <li> There are better designs out there even at this price point.</li>
    <li> works great and great value price</li>
    <li> I use this to keep my beard shaped and trimmed and it work very well.</li>
    <li> Wow, was really surprised at how well this works.  Just follow the directions which are simple and what I love the most is that there are not multiple pieces to keep up with and change out like other clippers that have 10,12, or 14 guard combs.  just adjust the dial starting with a high number and notch it down until you get the desired length.  Already has paid for itself in a month with the $50 I saved not paying my regular hairdresser $25 a visit twice in a month.</li>
    <li> Just got my second one of these trimmers after 17 years of dependable service from the first unit.  Yes, the plastic guard is fragile, but it did last all that time.  Heckuva a good buy, and great technology from Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Problem with the comb, it breaks so easy.</li>
    <li> This WAS a decent clipper with a nice plug in wall charger. But I need a more refine trimmer for my stache and beard which will have a better trim blade and more refined clipper guide.  Unfortunately  the detachable clipper guide broke so it made this item unusable.</li>
    <li> Wish the motor would rotate faster - not as powerful as I thought</li>
    <li> I found it to be good and easy to use (I do a simple, short haircut).  Works like a charm.  Easy to hold and comb through all parts of the head.  I had read reviews which warned of the difficulty of pulling off the comb.  My suggestion ... click it to the longest cut position and PUSH it off from the tab side with your thumb - easy one-handed operation.  I am very happy with the product.  Used it 6-8 times so far.</li>
    <li> Device and battery is still working fine after 3 years. If needed, I found a replacement battery online for $10, but with shipping and the time to take apart and solder the new battery, it&#x27;s worth it to just buy a new one. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s difficult to design a waterproof shaver with a replaceable battery. This shaver isn&#x27;t built for fine shaving, the teeth only retract so far. This will allow me more adjustments and a closer trim: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008KEJ1LM/</li>
    <li> Still working after 4 years without any issues. I&#x27;ve used this to trim my head and facial hair. The adjustable length-comb is a really nice feature, no need to remove clips. Overall does what I need it to do, cut hair.</li>
    <li> Not a bad hair clipper mostly will be used for a beard I can understand why it is only  20 dollars but it&#x27;s well worth it what I like the best about it is the number gauge for the length to cut it locks in and doesn&#x27;t move yes there is better Clippers out there but they are more expensive this is good for the price</li>
    <li> I used this clipper numerous times during my deployment to Afghanistan,  I appreciate how the unit was compact enough to fit in my bags with out all the clipper attachments.</li>
    <li> i loved it because it is very good machine. also, i can use it wherever i want.&lt;br /&gt;it is perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great all you need</li>
    <li> Slightly worried about the guard breaking when I take it off to clean it, and hair gets clogged in there so you have to clean every few swipes for a haircut - other than that, it&#x27;s great.  I love the adjustability of it all-in-one!</li>
    <li> not very powerful for thick hair</li>
    <li> eligible, working good, fast charging  nice and quiet.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the efficiency of this trimmer! Easy to use, does not pull and cuts evenly. NO more scruffy loose hairs that can be missed using scissors. Feels and looks like professional quality and at a great price. As an added bonus I can use it to give myself a hair cut as well. No unneccessary attachments and it is not complicated. Just turn the dial to the desired setting, switch it on and you&#x27;re ready to trim. Saves time and money. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just loved it! I mostly use for my hair and I love how it goes smoothly! Its easier to clean. But the Plascit on the top comes out if you put it in higher number other than that Its a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I think this product beats out other similar products in this price range. It&#x27;s good quality and works very well</li>
    <li> It worked well for me for about a year or so before it just stopped working. I tried charging it but when I took it off the charger for use, it turned on for a second before shutting off again. When it was working, I had no complaints but disappointed it did not last though.</li>
    <li> **UPDATE - Battery stopped recharging after 7 months. Have to pay for the shipping to send it into the warranty department in Texas. Waste of time and money.**  Cheap piece of crap that barely works like most other trimmers. Someone really needs to innovate in this category because over the last many, many years I&#x27;ve been trimming my chest, face and happy place I&#x27;ve never found a decent trimmer.</li>
    <li> Good little trimmer. Wish there was a cord option.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for same item which never did work properly.  Battery wore down within a few days.  It was out of warranty so I just purchased a new one which is just as great.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Personally I love this product because it has two trimmer heads which allow you to cut close, or your average edge up from a barber!</li>
    <li> bought it april,now not working again.</li>
    <li> This is the third one of these that I have bought, so it&#x27;s safe to say I&#x27;m rather satisfied. Every time I try another clipper, I am always disappointed, so I end up returning to this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about 3 months now. I was very skeptical because of all the reviews I&#x27;d seen about it breaking very easily. Well, I can&#x27;t say anything about breaking but this last week I pushed down so hard on it that went from the 8th setting to a 0 and took off half my beard off with it. Still works great but I don&#x27;t trust it much anymore.    EDIT: A few months later, the attachment to this trimmer ended up breaking like most reviews mention. When it broke, I ended up buying a replacement attachment and not even a week later it had broke again. I really liked this trimmer but next time I&#x27;ll be more cautious and listen to people online. My review has gone down to a single star as a result..</li>
    <li> Sturdy product that is very quiet.  I use it to trim my moustache &amp; hair and it does a great job very quickly.  More power and better cut than the Norelco I had for 5 years.</li>
    <li> It works great for cutting hair and beards.  It charges fast and works great on hair.  No more barber for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with how easy this is to use, clean, charge, etc.  Have used it both dry and it the shower, and it performed perfectly both ways for my hair cutting purpose.</li>
    <li> I pretty much liked the product. It does a nice job and is pretty compact. But I am not sure if the number 0 shaving is as good as the rest, it feels like there is more hair left compared to my other machine&#x27;s number 0 but this one is definitely more compact.</li>
    <li> Nice clipper for the money.</li>
    <li> This trimmer and a pair of scissors are all I need to keep my beard looking clean and in check.  The adjustable length dial works perfectly and I already bought a replacement comb head in case mine breaks (although it seems sturdy enough).  Waterproof design makes clean up a breeze.  I definitely recommend this trimmer to anyone looking for a bargain.</li>
    <li> For around $25, you can get years of haircutting pleasure from this nifty device.  The trim adjustment locks into place when you select a length and turn on the power; you can&#x27;t accidentally scalp yourself, due to this thoughtful feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken this all over the world.  This is my third one in about ten years.  Can you tell I like it?  Eventually the battery wears out, but by then the blades are probably getting dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried enough trimmers to know a good one when I see, and use, it.  This is the best one on the market, even taking the major flaw into account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real downside is that the trim comb attachment has two weak spots; one on each side.  Eventually it will break.  But don&#x27;t panic; there&#x27;s no need to throw away a perfectly good trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like this trimmer as much as I do, you&#x27;ll get a couple of spare attachments now, before the breakage happens.  I bought a half-dozen of them (here on Amazon) a year go, and I&#x27;m on number three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need this page:  http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-ER224-Beard-Trimmer-Attachment/dp/B001DNTQTY/ref&#x3D;cm_aya_orig_subj</li>
    <li> Hair does not fall from the trimmer, It balls up  and does not drop out causing the blades to be clogged and then no even cut.&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable guide keeps hair balled up causing this.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a good design needing improvement..</li>
    <li> This replaced an older Panasonic trimmer.  My husband had used it for years and finally had to replace it.  He was relieved they were still being made.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and bought it at a reasonable price.  I recommend this Panasonic to anyone who wants a great beard shaver.</li>
    <li> Very ergonomic design, easy to use</li>
    <li> my first was great but upon charging it oe day it would not...after replacing it i noticed the trimmer must be on the on position to charge!  now i have two!</li>
    <li> Phenomenal price and works just like it is advertised&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to trim this size do the beard back of my neck you need if you do it for $20 I highly doubt you&#x27;ll find anything</li>
    <li> Works much better than the other cordless shaver that it replaced, but I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars after it cut my ball sack on multiple occasions.</li>
    <li> Good product shaves well gets close. the only complaint i have about it is its kinda hard to get right behind the ears because of the guard length...overall im not disappointed</li>
    <li> Best wet/try shaver I&#x27;ve found, at a great price.  Tried to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to fancier (and more expensive) models from other companies, but this one seemed to have the best offering by way of blade size, adjustable cutting lengths, and a line-edger so that you can actually shape and detail your beard.  You don&#x27;t realize how important the line-edger is until you don&#x27;t have one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is way more adjustable than others I tried, cutting from a very close 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, to a long grizzly beard trim.  Not the greatest battery life, but the recharging dock and charging time are good.</li>
    <li> Came back to purchase the same exact model of clippers I purchased over 10 yrs ago. The motor on mine died. I&#x27;m very happy with this new set and like the new style charger that they came with.</li>
    <li> Best darn clipper/trimmer on the market. The purring of this super powerful motor lets you know it&#x27;s gently like a pussy cat so not to rip the hairs out like so many of the other much more expensive brands and models. PLEASE KEEP MAKING THIS ONE!!!</li>
    <li> Does everything I need it to do and does it well.</li>
    <li> Battery every got charged had to return it</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and this unit takes a number of passes to cut correctly. It is of little use on my son&#x27;s thick mop. I use it for mustache trimming, too and it works great for that. Previously we had a corded model that cut better, but cordless is so convenient it seems worth the trade off in performance. WE have had this over a year. I was worried the plastic comb would break easily, but it seems to be holding up.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband about a year ago and he loves it.  The plastic guard did break after about 6 months, but I bought another on Amazon for about $5 and it&#x27;s still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Pro is that there are not individual attachments that are a hassle to travel with and that are easier to get lost. In addition, the charger is better then other chargers because the shaver plugs firmly into the charge cradle that then goes directly into the wall without extra power cords. I was concerned by the length of the cut being limited to very short but does longer hair cuts, such as pixies for women that are significantly longer while doing very short hair. Negative is the personal groomer that is attached due to it is hard to aim or get into tighter spots. It is going to take some practice but think I will sick to the MicoTouch groomer (silver and black old model). However, it will work in a bind or when traveling and need to bring only the essentials.</li>
    <li> I wish it operated on batteries.It is a bit bigger/larger than I thought it would be.BUT the trimming results are very good.</li>
    <li> ok, not very powerful</li>
    <li> Works well, like the adjustable guard feature.  Panasonic makes quality products and this one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it for my beard!</li>
    <li> IT ALL STARTED WITH A TERRIBLE HAIRCUT AT THE BARBER SHOP - IN ORDER TO REPAIR IT, THEY CUT MORE OFF, AND THE MORE THEY CUT THE WORSE IT LOOKED, SO I TOLD THEM TO JUST BUZZ IT DOWN TO 1/8TH INCH ALL OVER - THEN I REALIZED THAT IT DIDN&#x27;T LOOK THAT BAD AND I DECIDED THAT I COULD SAVE $30.00 PER MONTH BY DOING IT MYSELF. THIS WAS THE BEST MONEY I EVER SPENT!!! NOW, TWICE A WEEK, I USE IT TO KEEP MY HAIR PERFECT (FOR AN 80 YEAR OLD MAN) AND NEVER LOOK LIKE I NEED A HAIRCUT. COULDN&#x27;T BE HAPPIER!!</li>
    <li> Goods as described, fast delivery! I rather!</li>
    <li> Hi,  The charger is not Australian standard setting, I try to plug the charger to the power but it will not plug in because it has only two and straight, Austrlain Standard are three plug and sligt bend, can you please send me the correct charger AC 120v is not australian standard Australian standard 220 v Can you please send me adaptable from 220v to 120 v or tell me how to do with his Panasonic YOU SHOULD KNOW THE COUNTRY RULE and STANDARD Thanks Farouk</li>
    <li> I will give the item 5 stars but there is one drawback and that is it doesnt have any kind of internal vacuum for the hair, it just falls all over the place. It is fully waterproof though and lasts a week or more between charges.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well.</li>
    <li> great machine, i onwed one before and im glad i found a replacement</li>
    <li> The problem was the plastic comb attachment for the length of hair or beard.  The plastic comb attachment is not continuous and separated from back side from front side, and moves when press the the scalp or face, and varies the length of hair or beard.  I filled the front side of the comb but it did not make difference.  It did not serve the purpose of my intention, I had to order a cheep battery operated small beard trimer, which has a continuous comb.  The clipper itself is durable and steady, only the dialed comb is the problem.&lt;br /&gt;I used a Panasonic Rechargeable Beard/Hair Trimer ER388 for many years and I liked it as far as the comb attachment, it is worn out now and they do not make it any more.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t listen to all these people complaining that the plastic beard trimmer breaks after 10 or 20 uses. They are either idiots or way too hard on the product. I&#x27;ve had this product for years and the plastic piece was just fine and never cracked or broke. If you use it as intended and don&#x27;t drop it or smash it or hard on it then you will never have a problem just like the majority of these people who love it. I will say that I am buying a replacement because my battery just died but I&#x27;ve had it for years so I&#x27;m not hugely mad or concerned about that. If I would&#x27;ve kept the receipt from target Panasonic says they would&#x27;ve fixed it for me under warranty or something but I threw away the receipt so that&#x27;s my fault. I do have one major complaint though and that&#x27;s why I would give it either at three or four stars and that&#x27;s the minute sure tremor that extends outward. Not the main trimmer but the miniature one. I think this miniature tremor is designed for fine exact trimming of beard and mustache us so you can get something really close on the edge however when you extend it it&#x27;s equal and the links to the main tremor and so when you go to try and use it it&#x27;s too close to the big trimmer therefore it is totally useless because you will end up cutting off hair that you don&#x27;t want to cut off because the main large tremor ends up touching your beard are your mustache or your hair instead of the small tremor on my. That is a huge design flaw. However I get around this by just taking off the plastic guard and using the main large trimmer on any fine meticulous trimming. I also just use my Gillette fusion razor on the backend which has a single blade used for trimming in the bottom and top of my beard to make straight lines. Overall I would highly recommend this Panasonic product mainly because it lasted me for years, because it has a Thone of flank settings, because you can use it dry or wet, because you can use it plugged in or cordless, and because it comes with a brush toclean it and oil to keep it well oiled. This is been the best product I&#x27;ve ever bought for trimming my beard and I have all and probably three or four over the last 15 years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but not perfect</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift so I can&#x27;t give many details, but my dad said it works well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this same groomer in 2009 (over 3 years ago), and I am now ordering a second as replacement.  As another reviewer had mentioned, the plastic grey guard had broken, which could very well be a product malfunction.  However, mine did not break until after several years of usage.  I had purchased the &amp;#34;Braun body cruzr&amp;#34; and it was broken within two months, not to mention it cost $10 more than this Panasonic item.  For the price and quality you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very simple in construction, . It should be just what you need.You could pay a lot more and not get a better trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have now owned 3 of these.  I use it about 2x a week to keep my head trimmed.  They seem to last about 2 years before the plastic guard breaks.  (this most recent time leaving me with a shorter haircut than I would have preferred)  Other than that, I have had no problems with it.  It holds plenty of charge and the charging stand works perfectly in a bathroom vanity outlet.  Just plan to replace it every couple of years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on here because my Panasonic ER224 motor finally died after using it for more than 6 YEARS. Never had an issue with this fantastic trimmer. Plastic guard never broke for me perhaps because I don&#x27;t abuse it like others have. I&#x27;m purchasing my second one to replace the one that was durable for me for 6 YEARS. If your going to treat this item as if it is made of cast iron than it&#x27;s going to break. Hope this review helps you to decide to buy it.</li>
    <li> Good for multi length beards. Holds a good charge long time. Good buy the kind we do not regret.&lt;br /&gt;JR</li>
    <li> Works better than I had anticipated....very pleased.</li>
    <li> Awesome, best on the market. My last one lasted for a few years and then stopped working. I picked something else on sale which would slip and shave my beard. I&#x27;m happy I found it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer, plus cordless.  I really, really like the dial-in hair length capability.  It is easy to use on myself.  Plus, one charge gets me two complete haircuts, plus multiple touch-ups in between.  I can see that the guides might break if handled roughly,  Easy enough to avoid if one does not squeeze them when handling the trimmer.  So grip more toward the body, rather than on the ends of the guard, when removing and replacing.  Anyway, I ordered a spare (Panasonic ER224 Beard Trimmer Comb Attachment) from Amazon at the same time as this...it is in a drawer, just in case.  And don&#x27;t be concerned about the picture for the spare...it is the wrong picture.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer for a neatly groomed beard,but the small trimmer attachment is difficult to use,all in all a great product</li>
    <li> Awesome clippers!  Super easy to use and comfortable.  I loved that all the components are built in instead of having a million time parts to assemble.  Will definitely be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent and long lasting for my personal needs!  Fairly priced too!</li>
    <li> NOT CRAZY ABOUT IT,THE HEAD IS HARD TO REMOVE WILL NOT  BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> on time delivery and works just as advertised, actually works better than I expected.</li>
    <li> This trimmer cannot cut short hair/beards. Even the lowest setting is much longer than any of the images on the package.</li>
    <li> Very useful and economical!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s either been broken since I received it or it&#x27;s junk. Even the closest setting isn&#x27;t very close.  Not up to Panasonic standards...  &amp;#34;Shaggy&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Operates without problem, but since I have a curly beard I can&#x27;t let it grow too long or the trimmer fingers get caught in the tangled undergrowth and it&#x27;s a slow process, with yanking. The barber&#x27;s trimmer doesn&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
    <li> Was bought to replace an old Panasonic which had lasted for years. This one broke within a day and had to be returned!</li>
    <li> Nice cutting trimmer with a good range of lengths, easy to clean and the charge is long lasting.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair clipper for haircuts. But it does not work as well for cutting body hair. For body hair, I have found the following trimmer to be better: Panasonic ER-GB40-S Cordless Mustache &amp; Beard Trimmer Wet/Dry with 19 Adjustable Settings. The interesting thing is that the ER-GB40-S is not as good for cutting hair so I have settled to having both the ER224S and the ER-GB40-S.    The nice thing about the ER224S for cutting hair is that one does not need to change the combs. The ER224S has a dial that one turns to adjust the hair length provided by the comb. The only downside to the ER224S is that if it falls down the comb breaks easily. I have broken several combs over the past 4 years. The good thing is that the comb is replaceable as an individual part. In addition, the whole unit is not that expensive, if one needs to buy another new one as replacement. It is well worth the price!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and price! Use it to cut my son&#x27;s hair, had one for over 5 years and finally had to replace it, they last a long time and do the job right.</li>
    <li> My fiance loved this as a gift!  The charging station is plugged in so that the clipper does not take up any counter space and the settings are easy to use.</li>
    <li> Best I could find. Buy it!</li>
    <li> This is my second unit. Bought this to replace my first unit that finally won&#x27;t hold a charge anymore. I can&#x27;t say enough about the quality and function of this trimmer. I wear a goatee and trim up my own hair and used this for both for around 6 years. It never let me down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about to order my 3rd one of these. I&#x27;ve not found a better trimmer, but it has too very bad flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The dial is hard to read. I&#x27;ve three times now set it at 1 thinking it was 11. Once before giving a talk in front of 100 people. Check the dial carefully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The plastic guard must be removed to access the detail trimmer. It will break if you drop it. I&#x27;ve done this twice now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it&#x27;s worth it. I wish they&#x27;d fix the flaws, but it&#x27;s the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this to trim my beard, goatee and mustache and worked great. I just trimmed my hair as well a few days ago and works really well. My last all in one trimmer was good but had too many attachment and the attachments were easily movable accidentally. This one is perfect as there is only one attachment and it cant be moved while it is turned on. I was afraid to trim my hair with the old one but this one works like a charm. Easy to use and easy to wash as it&#x27;s a wet/dry trimmer.  I only wish it came with a cable instead of the outlet stand but that&#x27;s not a big deal for me.</li>
    <li> I have owned this trimmer for 6 years and use it regularly. I&#x27;m very happy with the trim lengths, the battery life (which still holds enough charge for about 5-6 shaves before needing to be plugged in even after so many years) This is a very reliable workhorse trimmer for beards and other body hair trimming.&lt;br /&gt;The only knock is that these blades are impossible to sharpen and require replacement. This isn&#x27;t a conservative use of the materials and seems like a money grab on the part of Panasonic. For a little more money I can replace the entire unit just because I need to sharpen my blade.&lt;br /&gt;I will be replacing my old one with the same product. 6 years is all I could have asked when I bought this.</li>
    <li> I have had these clippers since Dec 2008, and they are still in phenomenal shape, some 6+yrs later. Admittedly, I have taken good care of them, in regards to cleaning them and ensuring they are oiled regularly, but if you treat them right, they&#x27;ll treat you right. It takes me about 40minutes to cut my hair, and as long as I have given them a decent charge beforehand, they last that long with ease.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my BF for christmas.  He was previously using an older conair trimmer with several blade guards that were always getting lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is sleek, the guards are built in and the charging station is small and compact.  Takes up much less room than the old conair trimmer.  This thing can also be used in the shower, which is a nice feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:  we were concerned at first, because the dial for the guard didn&#x27;t seem to lock in place when the trimmer is powered off.  When you turn on the trimmer it locks the guard so it doesn&#x27;t accidentally push back in and trim your hair super short!</li>
    <li> the shaver is great - lasts on g on charge - good quality blades...etc&lt;br /&gt;the head is flimsy plastic and will break after any significant use....&lt;br /&gt;you can do better with remington or braun...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the clipper for a week so used it only 7 times.  I expected some change of muscle memory learning how to use a different style trimmer.  Interestingly, the beard trimmer that died was a Panasonic that I had for about 5 years.  Except for the battery not taking a charge, I&#x27;d still be happily using that one.  It had easy to adjust comb settings and could get any corners (by my nose) easily.  This new one cannot.  It&#x27;s big, bulky, and designed badly.  Since the comb straddles the blades, you can&#x27;t get in tight.  There was so much positive review about this shaver / trimmer, I thought I would go for it.  I&#x27;m regretting the decision.  Other than design, this *is* working flawlessly.  Personal choice issues, no durability problems (yet-- see other reviews).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about 7 years. I bought it at target and when I get married I put some overtime usage on it. I admit that the comb recently broke on me to my surprise but contrary to what some of these other reviewers are saying it didn&#x27;t happen in two months or something ridicuolous like that. The wet/dry feature on this is awesome. And I never oiled it so that was a huge plus.  I don&#x27;t remember how much it cost when I first bought it but for $20 this is a steal.</li>
    <li> If your thinking of buying this, do it. its a great product that is really a good deal for the price. Great all around**</li>
    <li> Recommend to have the adapter voltage range of 110V - 240V, Which can be used at my native place (for grid supply of 230V)</li>
    <li> I never had a beard trimmer before and when I started a beard I say the need for one. I did a lot of research by reading reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I went with this one. So many of the ones I read about required changing to different heads to get the hair length you wanted. With this one it is simply a matter of &#x27;dialing&#x27; in the setting you want. It has a small slideout trimmer that gives total control to do fine tuning on your beard. You can remove the slotted head and use it almost like an electric razor......my wife does a great job of trimming the rear of my neck with this. One hint, when you remove the slotted cover to clean it run the dial to the highest number and pull the cover off. When you replace it dial it to the lowest setting. This makes a very easy off and on.&lt;br /&gt;In total I can&#x27;t imagine having a handier tool than this for beard and hair maintenance.....get it, you will be glad you did!!</li>
    <li> Very efficient and powerful.</li>
    <li> I got him this trimmer for Christmas and he loved it. He left the charger in a hotel room and we couldn&#x27;t find it. I got him a couple new trimmers and he hated them. Luckily we were able to find this one on Amazon, so now he has 2 trimmers with 1 charger haha. GREAT trimmer</li>
    <li> These things are amazing.  I have owned one for years as my travel trimmer and just bought a second one to replace a puny &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; back at home with a worn out battery.  They have almost as much torque as AC clippers.  I shaved my head and face on a single charge, and that was after several years of use.  The blades say to oil them, but I never have without any adverse affects.  The trimmer sits in the charger, and the charger plugs directly into the wall, so it doesn&#x27;t take up any counter space (perfect for travel).  The guard is adjustable out to 7/8&amp;#34;, but if you yank on it, it&#x27;ll pop off of the blades and give you a true &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; length.  Also has a very fine secondary trimmer on the back.  I&#x27;ve gone through many trimmers, but I&#x27;ve never found any better than these.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> i was looking for a unit to replace my 10+ year old, plug in,  conair which was a workhorse but recently, finally, died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the conair, i got accustomed to being able to remove all attachments and adjust the depth of the blade itself with the adjustment lever to shave my face without hurting myself at all permitting me to leave a 5 oclock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was hoping to have that ability with this razor (which does get close) but i do not as the blade doesn&#x27;t really quite make it past the edge of the large, plastic, built in attachment to touch the skin right for the depth im looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that being said, it seems well built and sufficient for most lengths above &#x27;shadow&#x27;. the adjustment circle seems sturdy and the unit itself seems to be a good value for the relatively inexpensive price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;even though it doesn&#x27;t suit my current need im going to keep it because it seems worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps</li>
    <li> What a piece of trash. This is a major step down from the prior model. If you keep a short beard, you can&#x27;t get to the hairs below your nose. No matter what setting you choose, it&#x27;s really easy to erase your beard. I&#x27;m beyond very disappointed. Wish I hadn&#x27;t dropped my old model.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer recently and absolutely love it!  Adjusts to many different levels and works great.  I think the battery could be improved upon as it seemed to be starting to run low after my first haircut, but that isnt a big deal for me.  I would buy another if this one broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - Although I still like this trimmer quite a bit, it does lack power and would be perfect if it was a bit more powerful. Still very happy with it, just an observation.</li>
    <li> This product broke within weeks under gentle use. Panasonic customer service has never responded to my requests for service. Terrible product. Terrible service. Waste of money. Feels like a children&#x27;s toy.</li>
    <li> excellent product, very good at relationship between Quality vs Price, recommended 100%</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd. The 1st one, one of the &#x27;teeth&#x27; broke.  The 2nd obe, the base of the &#x27;teeth&amp;#34; broke. Could have been my fault.  See what happens to this one.  I live it inspire of the other two. My 3rd one broke at tge same place and no repplacemnet and niw I have 3 working clippers without the &#x27;comb&amp;#34;  SO I think I now give this a 2Stars... I love the product but I wont keeping buying it as I have 3!!! with all broken comb,,,,</li>
    <li> I was truly pleased when I used my trimmer for the first time. The fact that it is rechargeable and adjustable makes it a real value for my busy life. A great tool!</li>
    <li> its easy to use ad the only thing i expected to have charger with wires and it was not there. So simultaneously we cant do shave while charging.</li>
