<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have chemically relaxed bra-strap length hair that is dull and dry. This product helps a lot. I apply a quarter sized amount (I have a lot of hair) and focus on my ends, which need the most care. Then I blow dry with an ionic blow dryer and a round brush. My hair is soft, smooth, bouncy and straight that often times I can shape my hair with only the round brush, no flat iron needed! It also has a pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t give hair that burnt smell that a lot of leave-in conditioners do when you blow dry with product in. I just love this stuff because it is affordable, works great on relaxed hair and makes my hair appear shinier and feel smoother. I am so glad I discovered this product and I recommend it to everyone! Give it a try :)</li>
    <li> This is the best leave-in/styling lotion I&#x27;ve ever purchase. It smells wonderful and leaves the hair shiny and bouncy, full of life. I Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Lacio Lacio leaves hair shiny but a little dry. I found salerm 21 to be a better product as a leave in for wet sets.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sold on it after using in combination with silicon mix, but I tried it again blow dried and straightened my hair (which I only do once a week), and I can&#x27;t keep my hands out of my hair, it&#x27;s so soft, super motorized which is something I have had a battle with in my 4a/4b relaxed hair. This will become one of my staples definitely.</li>
    <li> I have medium coarse, wavy/curly, frizzy hair made worse by coloring and wiry greys.  This product made my hair much softer, though I have to use two pumps of quarter-size amounts for shoulder length hair.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy, though my hair is very dry.  And, it doesn&#x27;t have the slippery feeling of any silicones, which is what I wanted, as I will use a heat protector and a finishing serum and didn&#x27;t want to add extra cones.  I purchased this because it seemed to have the most silk of the products I reviewed, and I know silk makes my hair soft.  The price is good, it will last a long time, and it did what I was going for--softness.  Maybe it adds some shine, hard to tell with the other things I use as well.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  It came highly recommended by curlynikki.com so I had to try it. I use it on washed hair that is semi-towel dried. When I blew dry and flat ironed my hair it made my hair SUPER soft.  I&#x27;ve also recently began to use it prior to using \\&quot;Curlformers\\&quot;.  It moisturizes really well and leaves my hair very soft and I never notice any residue.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail today. I opened up package and off the bat I noticed the labeling was different from the lacio that I already own. I then compared the ingredients from my original bottle to this bottle.... Different ingredients. The picture included is what I received.</li>
    <li> I must concur with the woman who said it was OK. I am very much a person who buys good hair products so I think I can tell the difference between something good and something that is just OK. Not to say these others ladies could not but I thought it was just OK. It has a musk scent like an older woman&#x27;s perfume. I live in DC and I go to a hair salon near the Zoo called Imaj and my stylist there Franco did not like the product. He thought it made my hair to dry given I am an African American female. But I would not purchase this product again in fact I don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
    <li> I got this product two days ago and I got many complements about my hair yesterday at work. It is bright and soft like never before. I touch my hair and it silks through my fingers. I love it!!!I will order it again. Thank you, Amazon!! I hate going to the mall. I love shopping in your web site.</li>
    <li> I used to have dermatitis and have won my battle for ten wonderful years.After 2 times using this product my scalp broke out in big itchy scales.It took me almost two long months to get rid of it.My hair came out nice but I will never use this again and wanted to worn those with sensitive scalps.</li>
    <li> This product makes hair so soft and managable, it&#x27;s unbelievable. My hair is the most tangled after I wash, so that&#x27;s when I wanted to put this leave-in to the test. Lacio Lacio passed with flying colors and it also has a nice smell. I wish I could find a BIGGER bottle! Oh well I&#x27;ll just buy the a hundred little bottles, I never want to run out!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month now on my transitioning (relaxed to natural) hair and I really like it.  It makes my hair soft and manageable and the smell is not overpowering like some leave-ins that I&#x27;ve used.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have long, relaxed hair and I have found that this product works best for me when it is used on wet hair (which the directions suggest) before blow drying. After washing, I towel-dry my hair, apply this leave-in and a heat protectant serum (my personal fave is CHI Silk Infusion), and then proceed to blow-dry my hair. My hair is much more straight, soft, bouncy, and shiny than when I don&#x27;t use Lacio Lacio as my leave-in on freshly-washed hair. The smell is absolutely HEAVENLY and I cannot stop myself from grabbing the bottle and smelling it when I&#x27;m near it. It almost makes me wish that the scent came in the form of a body wash or something! I only wish that the smell lasted after the blow-drying and styling process is over, but alas, you can barely smell it once it is all said and done. (Why does it seem that only the smells of stinky products hang around?)     Another drawback is that it does absolutely nothing for my hair if applied when it is dry. (I suppose that this is why the directions suggest using it on wet hair). It even makes it feel a bit dry. Though it makes my hair soft, it doesn&#x27;t feel as if it has added moisture to my hair, regardless of whether it was applied on wet or dry hair. It does have some protein (listed sixth in the list of ingredients), so that my have something to do with it.     For those interested, here are Lacio Lacio&#x27;s ingredients: Water, Methylciclopolyslloxane, Dimethylpolysiloxane, Alcohol Graso C14-C18, Cetrimonium Chloride, (Quaternium 79) Hidrolized Wheat Protein, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Fragrance, DMDM Hidantoine, Methylchlorisothiazolinone/Methylisothiazolinone.</li>
    <li> I read so much about this product so I had to try to for myself. I was skepitcal. I didn&#x27;t think it would be as good as everyone says it is. Well, I ordered it and the same day I received the product I had to try it and I LOVED IT!!! I was not crazy about the scent but when I put it on my hair it was just so light on my hair and it made my hair so soft. The comb just glided right through. My son had just showered and he has long curly hair. I used it on him, now he is HOOKED! I am about to order my second bottle and maybe get a couple because everyone seems to love it so it&#x27;s going pretty fast. My son&#x27;s birthday is next month so I might just surprise him with his own bottle, lol. Maybe then he can leave mine alone :0)</li>
    <li> With this product, he won&#x27;t be able to keep his fingers out your hair.  The compliments you receive also make you happy you purchased this item.</li>
    <li> The product just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for. I used it but was not satisfied. It is not you , It is me.</li>
    <li> I had been using this conditioner for over a year and tried to switch to something else.  That was a fail and I am now back.  This conditioner leaves my 4b relaxed hair shiny and lays the cuticle down.  Roller sets always come out great.  I never got to try the one with mink oil, but I am very satisfied with this formula.</li>
    <li> This item had been part of my regime for a while.  When I ran out I couldn&#x27;t figure out just why my hair had reverted back to being dry and breaking off.  Since I use a few products in my hair after washing, and try different products, it took a while to figure out this was the product that was missing.  When I received the order and used it again, my hair was instantly healthy and shiny again.  I think they should advertise in its name as much as a restorative product as a \\&quot;high shine hair conditioner\\&quot;.  I happened on this product by accident and wish it was easy for others to find!  My hair is course, thick, dry, wiry; and really wants to do it&#x27;s own thing.  So, I think that really gives a positive testimony to the results it brings.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and one of the blogs stated that the Lacio Lacio was the best for shine&gt; I tried it on wet and dry hair but I didn&#x27;t see the high shine, not sure if I will re-purchase it.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product. I used it for the first time and cant say enough how good this product works. I did a roller set and used this as my leave in and the results were shiny, silky and so so soft. My hair never looked and felt so healty. I recommend this product to any one willing to try it, trust me you will love it.</li>
    <li> I have been transitioning from relaxed to natural for 7 months now. I have tried numerous products to help with detangling after I wash &amp; was just about to go back to my relaxer. I read several great things about Lacio Lacio being not only good for roller sets but good for detangling as well. I have a new found love! Lacio Lacio is the only product I have found to help me get through my frustrating detangling problem &amp; my roller set came out perfect. Thanks Lacio Lacio!</li>
    <li> I decided to use this thinking what the heck I have nothing to lose, I love this stuff.  I use it to wrap my hair and it comes out silky and shiney, this leave in conditioner is great on black hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is wonderful. I have thick textured hair that is permed, and it works so well when ever I wrap or roller set with it alone in my hair. I use to use mousse to do this, but once I started using this product, I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> Whenever i get done shampooing and conditioning my hair, i dont look forward to detangling which always results in a ball of shed hair. I have relaxed hair with very tangled ends and some splits ends.&lt;br /&gt;The deep conditioner i used did not give me much slip so i tried lacio lacio for the 1st time. I followed the instructions which recommend using it on wet hair so after i towel dried my hair i applied applied a medium sized amount throughout my hair in sections. Its important to apply it to your hair in sections to make sure it penetrates thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;The comb actually went through my hair in one smooth motion. I was shocked, like really shocked. To my surprise i combed my hair easily and detangling was a breeze with minimal breakage. No more fustration and clumps of hair on my comb.&lt;br /&gt;I left my hair to airdry and i got a soft curl pattern which was nice. I flat ironed short after and my hair is silky smooth and fine. Im writing this review a few days later and my hair is still very soft and easy to comb.&lt;br /&gt;Lacio lacio is now a must have in my hair regimen and if you&#x27;re on the fence try it. Its a miracle in a bottle!</li>
    <li> I have chemically relaxed, fine textured hair. The first time I used this product to roller set wet hair, I used it alone and the result was really dry hair (not to the point of feeling like straw). It had lightness and body, but no shine; it had a very dry hand. I had to immediately apply a small amount of  Moroccanoil Treatment to help correct the dryness. It did help and I had to continue applying it on a daily basis until my next wash day (I wash and set once weekly). I decided to give Lacio Lacio a second try, but using it with products I usually use: Moroccanoil Treatment and KeraCare Butter Cream (butter cream was applied sparingly to my ends) on my wet hair to combat the dryness. After roller setting and drying under hooded dryer like I usually do, my hair turned out worse. I had to wash and set my hair again four days later, this time having to do a pre poo with Keracare essential oils (I never did a pre poo before this experience). I went back to my usual leave in conditioner to set my hair and thankfully my hair was back to normal. This product clearly didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This product works great for my rollersets and braid outs. Also as a daily moisturizer. This product leaves my hair so shiny and silky (silk is like the third ingredient). This leave in isn&#x27;t greasy and will not weigh your hair down (Believe me, I know. I am very heavy handed with the products)... Definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much time to deal with my hair. When I want a straight look, I use this product and its fabulous. I&#x27;ve tried many \\&quot;professional\\&quot; products, but with very poor results. This product is the best. I can&#x27;t be without it. I&#x27;m glad I saw it here because I sometimes runout of it and my local beauty shop doesn&#x27;t always have it in stock. I use a quarter size amount on my toweled dry hair and then I blow dry with a big round brush and it straightens my hair out and leaves a smooth shiny finish. This is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim and I like it alot!  The entire transaction was positive; the product works great for my hair.</li>
    <li> Not happy at all. Was half empty when I received. The post man must hv taped it up. So thanks to them.</li>
    <li> hate it.The leave- in does not mix well with other products.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best hair conditioner for my African-American, color treated, straightened hair. I instantly see the difference it makes when I apply it to my hair. I can easily comb through my hair while it&#x27;s wet without any breakage because this conditioner is an instant detangler. After I blow dry and flat iron, my hair feels like pure silk. I call this my \\&quot;hair crack\\&quot;. I only wish they sold this at my local beauty supply stores. This is a MUST HAVE!!</li>
    <li> Saw review and recommendation from CurlyNikki website!  Wooow[...] just squeezed a some in a jar top, dipped end of my index finger in, rubbed between palms for a sec and smoothed on section for braid. Rubbed hair between palms, then a little dab around the roots then twirled around finger from root to end to distribute. My previously dry and rough ends (even though had a recent trim) became complete SMOOTH. Hair was soft and smooth. Completed my braids the same way, braid, twirled ends, and covered with satin bonnett. Unbraided in the a.m. BEAUTIFUL, soft, full, bouncy, healthy looking and feeling. Many complements&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 3 more bottles, would not want to run out, plus I want to share with some of my \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; friends :  ps. did NOT have problem with scalp other reviewer had, was a bit concerned.  Oh and I applied it on Day 4 of Braid-out on dry natural hair.</li>
    <li> I have used Lacio Lacio several times on my natural 3c/4a hair I was expecting a WOW factor, not so much yet. When applying the product on my hair it feels soft and has less breakage but afterwards it leaves my hair feeling stripped of moisture. I have used it with and without KCNT underneath, maybe next time I will try it on top. I seal with coconut oil or argon oil. I would like to incorporate Lacio Lacio into my regular hair regimen but I have to find a way to retain some moisture. I read where a previous rater added olive to the product with great results maybe I will try that.</li>
    <li> Good product makes hair soft to touch, but I really don&#x27;t see any shine.</li>
    <li> I purchased this looking for a good leave in. It leaves my hair hard, dry and there is no shine. I now use it when I slick my hair back (hair is still hard and dull) but when it&#x27;s gone I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> I dont like this product at all. it makes my hair frizzy and not silky at all, especially after i roller set. I use salerm silk and its better. However, i do use the remaining stuff of lacio, on my daughter&#x27;s naturally curly non colored hair and it made it really soft and silky. my hair is bleached and dyed so maybe it works best for non chemically treated hair. But i dont like it for my hair at all. Salerm is best for me.</li>
    <li> This really like this product, my hair is relaxed and color treated and it makes it feel so silky. It is perfect for roller sets like you wouldn&#x27;t beleive. Its on my list of products to help me stretch my relaxers.</li>
    <li> After reading the the product summary and the reviews, I was disappointed when I finally tried this conditioner. I used the product a total of three times, and parted my hair down the middle and used it on one side to determine it effectiveness. Horrible results. It made my hair extremely dry, even crunchy. The texture completely changed, and I was so worried that I would have to cut most of it off. My hair is type 4, so I&#x27;m not sure if Star works better on less a less kinky hair type. In any event, would not buy this again or recommend it for people with kinky curly hair.</li>
    <li> Works best for me on my roller sets. The shine and conditioning are amazing. You do not have to use much to have a wonderful glossy look to your hair. This product also helps to protect your hair from breakage. It&#x27;s one of the best leave-ins I have every used on my thick hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about this product, but it didn&#x27;t do wonders for my 4a/4b natural hair. It left my hair sticky and gummy (with white flakes) as opposed to soft and moisturized. Maybe I got a bad batch? I also didn&#x27;t like the smell of the product.     I&#x27;ve heard a lot of women with chemically relaxed hair rave about this product, and I&#x27;m not saying that it won&#x27;t work for you. It just didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.    INGREDIENTS: WATER, METHYCICLOPOLYSILOXANE, DIMETHYLPOLSILOXANE, FATTY ALCOHOL, C14-C18, CETRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, QUATERNIUM-79, HYDROLIZED SILK PROTEIN, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, FRAGRANCE, DMDM HYDANTOINE, METHYLCHLOROISOTIAZOLINONE/METHYLISOTIAZOLINONE</li>
    <li> I hav been using this product with the BOE CRECE PELO products and trust me.Only wen i got to the hair dresser the comb goes rite thru like that. I was in AWWW wen the comb jus went thru my hair like butter. OMG it makes your hair feel so soft afterwards.WILL B BUYING IT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I thought this would be a great product for my natural hair, I applied this to my freshly washed hair, it made my hair soft,but that was it. My hair stayed dry as ever!! So I gave this to my daughter who is relaxed, and her hair loves it! she flat irons and blow dries her hair on an constant basis so this has become part of her reggie. I have noticed that my hair does not do well with Salerm21 and Lacio Lacio I&#x27;m thinking maybe its because of the cones in the products, Both left my hair soft, but I had to remoisturize my hair every night or my hair would be a dry tangled mess! So needless to say, I&#x27;m back to the curly girl method.</li>
    <li> After using just one time, I had itchy white flakes around my crown area. It did leave a shine, but so does my Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine leave in conditoner.</li>
    <li> I am about 11 weeks out from my last relaxer so needless to say I am pretty thick at the roots. I washed my hair and used a conditioner and washed it out. My hair was very thick and slightly difficult to comb through. I put in this leave in conditioner and even though my hair was thick, it was very soft and I was able to comb through it immediately. I then blow dried my hair with the attachable comb and then flat ironed it. I was absolutely amazed at the shine but esp the fact that my hair now looked like I was only a couple weeks post relaxer. I have gone to several Dominican shops in my area and wondered what in the world they were putting in my hair before they roller set it. After a little research, I have the answer and can save myself time and money doing my own hair!</li>
    <li> This stuff made me fall in love with my hair again. My rollersets come out so soft, shiny and full of body! My staple hair product now</li>
    <li> this product is the best and only leave in conditioner i use. I add some olive oil to it and shake it up, because the olive oil gives it moisture. I can comb through my hair with not one single tangle and not oly is my hair extremely manageable but its soft and i can wear my hair curly or straight and still comb through it. Its wonderful just add olive oil to it as a moistuirzer, pour some in and shake up the bottle. I will use this forever. it is a permanent part of my hair regimen. I have a hair regimen that works for me and my hair is growing long, strong and healthy the way hair should. African American hair can grow!</li>
    <li> stops or greatly reduces hair breakage.</li>
    <li> I am relaxed. I love this product. It has been a staple since I began my hair journey (March &#x27;13). It leaves my hair very soft and moisturized. I agree it does not give shine so I proceed to use a hair serum or coconut oil after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;A major draw back for about this product is its availability. I wish it was readily available at beauty supply stores. However, I like that it lasts me about 3 months.</li>
    <li> Offers no real softness or anti frizz protection. Feels like watered down conditioner. However, shipping was quick and came in a perfectly sized carton that fit in my mailbox.</li>
    <li> This was ok. If you use too much it leaves your hair dull. A small amount will hydrate and provide a lil protection for heat. Not sure if this is a must have in my arsenal .</li>
    <li> I do like this product but only wished that they made a bigger size.  I went through one bottle quite quickly, but it does do a good job of keeping curls manageable.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything special for me. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair .</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. I have had it for a little over a week and I will definatly be buying more. I have only used it on wet hair once and it was in combination with another product so I dont really know how it works on my wet hair. However on my dry hair (chin length and relaxed) it is a wonderful moisturizer and mixed with water it helps to set my jumbo rollers when I throw them on dry hair. My hair moves, feel moisturized and there is no build up!</li>
    <li> I am writing a review on this and the Silicon Mix...I am not sure if it&#x27;s both products but I love this as a leave in when I roller set my hair. My hair has slip with no product buildup. I use a nickel size on my shoulder length hair. I am now addicted to Dominican products!</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in I&#x27;ve ever used! It smells nice and leaves my hair very moisturized, shiny, and soft. This is a must have staple in my hair regime. Athough I&#x27;m natural a wear my hair straight most if the time and this leaves my hair looking like I got a perm! This also work awesomely on my curls as well. Dominican products in general are wonderful and definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I should have ordered more than one bottle, but I&#x27;ve been burned so many times and have way too many expensive products under the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for daily use and doesn&#x27;t leave a build-up on my hair like some other products.  I found that I couldn&#x27;t use it without the oils, as once it&#x27;s dry, my hair didn&#x27;t feel moisturized.  Therefore, I mix it with different oils (Olive, Argan, and Ouidad Mongongo) for additional moisture.  This process works great.</li>
    <li> Do you think you would get the same results just using an oil (olive, avocado, jojoba, etc) and hydrolyzed silk protein (which can be purchased online from &#x27;From Nature with Love&#x27;)? Because the water and the hydrolyzed silk protein or silk peptide powder are the only two ingredients that are worth anything and would give you the silky, soft, manageable effect. The other ingredients listed in the product are really suspect. I decided not to purchase this because of them. Just a thought.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used it is so creamy and my hair loves it.  I am African-American and it did wonders for my hair!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Leaves my hair nice and soft. Delivery was quick too!! Thanks again!!</li>
    <li> I just dont like this stuff. Maybe its too runny. It left my hair hard. I applied on dry hair.</li>
    <li> This leave-in is, by far, the best leave-in conditioner I have ever used. For reference, I have very thick, tightly curled, mid-back length, multi-ethnic hair. For those interested in curl types: 3b-3c. Lacio Lacio leaves my hair so soft and silky. It is very easy to detangle after I apply this conditioner. It smells heavenly, and my hair will not settle for any other leave-in ever since I bought this one. I recently ran out and had to use a back-up moisturizer, and my hair did not like this. Without the Lacio Lacio, it was more difficult and time-consuming to detangle, and it felt a bit coarse. My Lacio Lacio order from Amazon finally arrived, and my hair would&#x27;ve thanked me if it could talk! You definitely won&#x27;t regret this purchase. However, if you have sensitive skin or skin problems, this product may irritate your scalp because of the preservatives they use. I have no problems with it, but if you have sensitive skin, you may just want to use a little at first to test it. The only thing I hate is that I can&#x27;t find it in any beauty supply stores around here, so I always have to order it online. I definitely recommend this to those with thick and/or curly hair!</li>
    <li> Love this leave in, I use it after washing, before using heat. Apparently the silicons in this product act as a heat protectant. My hair gets so straight but still feels strong and healthy. And its a light product so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It smells really good and it really makes your hair very straight. It doesn&#x27;t matter how curse your hair is this product will make it straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this!</li>
    <li> The best for my natural kinki hair. I use it for wash and go and I get the best curls!</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair..I use this with olive oil to straighten my hair..comes out looking shiny and healthy. Love</li>
    <li> The product is wonderful. My hair was soft and shiny. I used it along with Crece Pelo. Together they make a wonderful team for healthy looking hair.</li>
    <li> This product has so much slip, which is what my hair needs as it is easily tangled. It did not leave any residue or anything in my hair once dried. I consider it a staple item. Only problem is that the small bottle doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I would like.</li>
    <li> I am AA with relaxed hair. The closer I get to touch up time, the more I dread having to wash my hair as I find my hair more prone to tangle, break and/or shed at that point. Before I was using Wen Fig Cleansing Conditioner as my leave in, which did a serviceable job. It wasn&#x27;t perfect but it didn&#x27;t soften up my hair but dang is it expensive. After some research I saw that Lacio Lacio seemed to be a popular choice so I decided to give it a shot. WOW! This puts Wen to shame. My hair is a dream to comb through whether 1 week post relaxer or 10. Like Butter! A little bit goes a long way too.</li>
    <li> It seeps into hair almost immediately. Nothing has ever made my coarse 3C hair feel so moisturizer and soft. Perfect for dry and damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Great product for all hair types. I am balks with grade 4a. I use this product as a setting lotion. It leaves my hair soft, manageable and healthy. No flaking and I like the scent.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for nearly a decade and when I purchased it recently from Amazon, what I got was in the correct bottle, but everything else was different. The texture of the product was not thin; it was thick and clumpy. The smell was not fresh and clean; it was metallic and really disgusting. It did not make my hair feel soft; it caused flakes and made my scalp intolerably itchy. I bought TWO bottles thinking that I was going to get my usual product and I got something terrible and alien - not the product I&#x27;ve loved for years at all! I am extremely shocked and disappointed at this purchase and I think Amazon needs to do some quality control.</li>
    <li> Great when my hair was relaxed.  Awesome for rollersets. Does nothing for my 4a natural hair though.</li>
    <li> This stuff made my scalp itch idk y maybe because its hydrolized protein or something but I had higher hopes for this product:(</li>
    <li> I bought this to try as a leave in conditioner. I am African American and very particular about the products that I use in my hair. This leave conditioner is awesome. You don&#x27;t have to use very much of it and as such it lasts a long time. It smells nice and leaves my hair soft, manageable and frizz free. When I use it prior to blow drying and flat ironing my hair, it gives me that shine and bounce that I love. The price is right too....</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long period of time, so i would be able to tell just by the smell  that this is not the right product, when i opened the package there were some of the product spill out, i think it wasnt well closed, but i decided to give a try anyway.  As soon as i applied to my hair i realize this product wasnt the real one, i almost used the whole bottle trying to soften the hair but it was useless, when just a little b is enough for my hair. Im glad i had some of this product left from my last purchase and i was be able to compare, and let me tell u, the one i got now smell like saop and feel  like cheaply dollar store conditioner, i cant even comb my hair i had to wash it again and use lots of my regular conditioner bcs my hair was looking so dry and unmanageable, i dont really know what they been selling to the customers but this is not the lacio lacio leave in conditioner, so stop lying to people and selling fake stuff just for make money, so i want my money back or an authentic product , bcs this sh...t aint cheap, it really fost me 18 bucks , so come on u dont treat customers like that</li>
    <li> Gives a nice temporary shine but it doesn&#x27;t list ingredients on the label..not good for those looking for natural products</li>
    <li> Its Just okay. Kind of heavy on my hair.i stopped using it and gave it away. So...depends on the individual</li>
    <li> I love Star lacio High shine leave in Hair Conditioner, leave your hair very soft and shine and smells very good, I&#x27;ll always recommended</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! It really does wonders on my hair. I always use this product because, it does what I need it to do! If you thought about buying it, don&#x27;t think too hard, just get it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this leave in for years and I love it. I was relaxed in the beginning and now I&#x27;m natural, but I apply a little of this after I was my hair and my rollersets come out great. I don&#x27;t use it as my daily leave in due to the consistency.</li>
    <li> This leave in is the best that I have used for shiney bouncy rollersets.  I have using Lacio Lacio since 2007.  It is one of my staple products!</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner is SO AWESOME...it left my hair extremely soft and manageable. I am an African-American Woman with course, thick, kinky curly natural hair. I suffer with dry brittle hair and most &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; products don&#x27;t penetrate my hair, they just sit on the hair. This, coupled with &amp;#34;Lacio Silk Protein Concentrate Ampoulle&amp;#34; can&#x27;t be beat for moisture and conditioning, and the price it die for! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, it!</li>
    <li> OMG!  My hair is damaged due to heat and chemical use.  I am now on the journey  to get my hair healthy again.  This was recommended. I tried it for the first time and it made my hair shiny and soft.  Usually when I blow dry I need oil on it to give it that luster shine, however, with this, no oil is needed.  For me, that is unheard of.  This is a keeper and will be part of my new hair regimen.</li>
    <li> One word for it : Fantastic!</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer for the value! The product does not leave a greasy film and keeps my hair soft. Plus, a little bit of the product goes a long way.</li>
    <li> leaves hair soft i just love it  i have curly hair and my hair is a bit dry but as soon as i used this lacio lacio it made a difference my hair is so soft and just love my hair</li>
    <li> This leave in is beyond any measure.  Worked wonderful on my hair and fell in love with this conditioner.  I recommended this to all my family because its just that good.</li>
</ol>
