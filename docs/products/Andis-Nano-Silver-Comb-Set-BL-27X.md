      <li>These work great for a variety of clippers and the magnet keeps the comb nice and tight.</li>
      <li>I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t fit my Andis Master, but they fit like a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>Love the 2 magnet version larger combs</li>
      <li>I used this product last night and was pleased with the results</li>
      <li>large,...</li>
      <li>These have only one magnet and they fit the Oster Fast Feed.</li>
      <li>i have the fast feed clippers 76023-510, and the clips stick to them like glue.</li>
      <li>They fit big and move around a bit.</li>
      <li>They do the work and can be place in Andis and fast feeds</li>
      <li>But its not noticeable unless you are really looking at them.</li>
      <li>Really looking for sturdier metal option.  </li>
      <li>But I got these to use on my oster fast feeds and my wahl seniors.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got a poodle mix with very curly hair.</li>
      <li>the difference is very noticeable.</li>
      <li>They are very sturdy and do not budge.</li>
      <li>Clippers are quiet without the comb, but the comb magnet just doesnt hold strong enough and the magnet bouncing against the clippers make a terribly loud sound.</li>
      <li>This particular product worked as described.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend these clipper guards</li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>I highly recommend purchasing these.</li>
      <li>These are high quality combs.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>These guides (the single magnet version) as well as the larger set will fit on the 000 Oster blades perfectly without any slop, but they may not fit on other (larger) Oster changeable blade sizes.</li>
      <li>Make sure you find out if you are getting the single magnetic or the double magnetic</li>
      <li>The other was the fit.</li>
      <li>After you break the black original andis combs you really appreciate these magnetic break resistant ones.</li>
      <li>Not sure but being a girl I love</li>
      <li>You may read on some sites that these guides won&#x27;t fit on an Oster 76, but that is not entirely true.</li>
      <li>They LOOK well made and the magnets certainly SEEM strong, so I don&#x27;t want to give the attachments a bad rating, just wish the seller had posted more information about the models.</li>
      <li>Professional attachment.</li>
      <li>These attachments work week with my Andis Speed master II&#x27;s and Later Fast Feed clippers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m busy and don&#x27;t like any problems when working.</li>
      <li>The double magnets happened to be positioned right over the screws on the blade and won&#x27;t seat properly.</li>
      <li>ONLY ONE MAGNET, not like the older ones w/2.</li>
      <li>They are easy to clean haven&#x27;t had a issue with them while cutting hair.</li>
      <li>From what I have researched, only the double magnet version works with the fast feeds.</li>
      <li>When you take them off, use the sides and no other angle.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They are the best.. I love these.</li>
    <li> Professional attachment. Gives the best haircuts</li>
    <li> Good product and Great price</li>
    <li> Did not fit my T-Outliner...</li>
    <li> Real easy to use, fits almost all andis blades</li>
    <li> I always wondered about these when a classmate bought some in barber school. After you break the black original andis combs you really appreciate these magnetic break resistant ones. I&#x27;m busy and don&#x27;t like any problems when working.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great but for some reason I got 2 number 0&#x27;s I didn&#x27;t get the #1</li>
    <li> i have the fast feed clippers 76023-510, and the clips stick to them like glue. very happy with the product and price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t own an andis clipper besides the t-outliner. But I got these to use on my oster fast feeds and my wahl seniors. They fit big and move around a bit. No big deal cause it has the magnet. Now, the magnets on this are great, super strong. But they seem to be only glued on. It&#x27;s been only 2 weeks and all of my magnets have fallen off the guard itself. Please invest in another product. I sure will. I will attempt to glue them back on my self but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to become a habit.</li>
    <li> Missing #1 guard! Delivery came with two &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; guards.</li>
    <li> I purchased small and they sent me large,...Only reason for the bad review.Very disappointing as for I was waiting for a week to cut my hair only to receive the wrong item.</li>
    <li> Blades are great to use, very compatable with most clippers. The downside is they break easily.</li>
    <li> These are the ones you want to buy if you want to go from a bald fade to a #4 attachment. These have only one magnet and they fit the Oster Fast Feed.</li>
    <li> perfect.  a must have</li>
    <li> Fits my Andis Masters. No problems</li>
    <li> The negative review is for misleading the consumer. The product I received only has a single magnet instead of the two shown on both of the images for this product. I have used the various clips and they work well, no problems. It is still an inferior product to what is being advertised. Update your images. Stop misleading consumers!</li>
    <li> Fits all of my andis clippers, i was concerned about the strength of the magnet. No worries magnet is strong, guard will not slip!! if you cut on a regular.... great investment</li>
    <li> It locks secure to clippers without feeling as if it may become detached while cutting, but does not save time connecting when compared to standard guards without the magnet.</li>
    <li> Fits great for the Master Andis (ml). Some of the comb teeth bend a little. But I would buy again</li>
    <li> I cut my hair and the hair of my siblings and I was looking for a set of combs for my Andis Master. These are high quality combs. I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t fit my Andis Master, but they fit like a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a little difficulty at first putting them on, but all you have to do is put it on the cutting end of the blade first then snap it into place at the magnet end.</li>
    <li> Flimsy plastic. Not good.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best set of guards I&#x27;ve owned. Was skeptical about the strength of the magnets but they are very strong..no problems there. The other was the fit. They fit my Andis Masters perfectly. in addition, they will fit the 000 detachable blade for oster or andis. WONT WORK ON ANY OTHER DETACHABLE BLADE.</li>
    <li> It shows 2 magnets but I got the ones with 1 magnet. Also, the magnets popped out on the second client that came in.</li>
    <li> Compared to the original Andis Nano with the two magnets, these are sorta flimsy. The original appear to be more solid.</li>
    <li> I got sent two #4 gaurds instead of a #3 and a #4.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Magnets are really strong.</li>
    <li> Good product but the number 4 magnet fell out during first use.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Fits my masters, delievered on time, and works perfectly as I expected! Great item!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t able to tell they were plastic.  Really looking for sturdier metal option.  I&#x27;ve got a poodle mix with very curly hair.</li>
    <li> I used this product last night and was pleased with the results</li>
    <li> These are awesome on my andis clippers. They are very sturdy and do not budge. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I liked these OK until i got the a set of the 2 magnet version. The 1 magnet one amazon sells here doesnt hold that well and makes a slight buzzing to bad buzzing sound depending on how well you push them down. The 2 magnet ones pop right on just how you&#x27;d expect.    EDIT: downgraded to one star. The one magnet just doesnt hold these combs to the clippers. Clippers are quiet without the comb, but the comb magnet just doesnt hold strong enough and the magnet bouncing against the clippers make a terribly loud sound. The only way these things are even usable if you jamn them down so hard that the back plastic tab is helping the magent. It works itself loose fairly quick and i have to push down really hard again. over and over. Absolutely hate them. Love the 2 magnet version larger combs i got elsewhere, work perfect.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my hair for a few years now and used the RED combs before. These work great for a variety of clippers and the magnet keeps the comb nice and tight.</li>
    <li> They do the work and can be place in Andis and fast feeds</li>
    <li> Awesomeness! I highly recommend purchasing these. Great quality. They fit my Andis Beauty Master perfectly.</li>
    <li> It was really nice!!!</li>
    <li> Fit is perfect for the andis master. The guards stay on until you want to take them off. Great product and wish I had these years ago!!! Fast delivery as well!</li>
    <li> These attachments work week with my Andis Speed master II&#x27;s and Later Fast Feed clippers. The go on real easy and stay attached.</li>
    <li> They were great!!!!!  Thank you</li>
    <li> My husband loves this</li>
    <li> Fits the andis masters perfectly and goes with ease. Only issue which is small, is when you adjust and close the clippers to zero gap the teeth tend to cut into the guard. You just can&#x27;t close all the way.</li>
    <li> Does NOT fit all Andis models! Fits only models MBA, MBX, MC-2, ML, MA-1, RACA, US-1, PM-1, PM-2, PM-3 and PM-4 according to the tiny print on the insert. So going back tomorrow. They LOOK well made and the magnets certainly SEEM strong, so I don&#x27;t want to give the attachments a bad rating, just wish the seller had posted more information about the models. So I went with a neutral 3 stars. BTW -  Did NOT fit Andis Plus model AG2.</li>
    <li> no need to hold your finger on these guards.</li>
    <li> these are probably the best guards. I recommend these because they dont fall as easy because they are magnet powered which make them stick to the clipper very tight! This fits almost any andis clipper.</li>
    <li> You may read on some sites that these guides won&#x27;t fit on an Oster 76, but that is not entirely true. These guides (the single magnet version) as well as the larger set will fit on the 000 Oster blades perfectly without any slop, but they may not fit on other (larger) Oster changeable blade sizes. Do not, however get the Andis blade guides with the double magnets. The double magnets happened to be positioned right over the screws on the blade and won&#x27;t seat properly. Oster 76 owners fear not; this set will fit perfectly on your 000 blade snugly and firmly. The only downside I see is the weird purple color of these guides, but then again color doesn&#x27;t affect their performance, right?</li>
    <li> Snap on quick and easy. When you take them off, use the sides and no other angle. It&#x27;s the easiest way. Fit on my Oster Fast Feeds perfectly and don&#x27;t move at all while I cut. These are just blades 0-4. If you want bigger, select the bigger portion.</li>
    <li> Got it for my oyster it moves a little bit on the blade. Make sure you find out if you are getting the single magnetic or the double magnetic the difference is very noticeable.</li>
    <li> This particular product worked as described. It likewise is a well made product. I would highly recommend these clipper guards</li>
    <li> ONLY ONE MAGNET, not like the older ones w/2. Best gaurds out. Solid. Buy the larger ones too. These will be the only combs you use in the shop from now on.</li>
    <li> Great for homecutting</li>
    <li> Received quickly. Attachments work great with my Andis clipper. Great quality... Durable,</li>
    <li> These are really solid attachments. With a magnet and a clip they will never fall off. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Just the right Guards I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more than what I got they fit my Andis masters perfectly. Have no issues with them at all.</li>
    <li> Great guards for andis masters improved, I am awaiting for my oster fast feeds to come and when they do I willl see if they fit as well. From what I have researched, only the double magnet version works with the fast feeds. So I will check to see if my single magnets work them as well.</li>
    <li> Great item fast delivery</li>
    <li> These are such a great buy! They are very durable and the magnetic part is strong yet easily removable if needed. They are easy to clean haven&#x27;t had a issue with them while cutting hair. They are purple as shown in pictures with specks of silver glitter, why the glitter? Not sure but being a girl I love glitter lol. But its not noticeable unless you are really looking at them. They are stackable since the magnets keeps t hem together nicely, so convenient for storing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Although these are made for Andis they fit my Oster fast feeds perfectly. These guides have helped me so much as I&#x27;m a beginner made me feel like a pro :p Best investment yet.</li>
