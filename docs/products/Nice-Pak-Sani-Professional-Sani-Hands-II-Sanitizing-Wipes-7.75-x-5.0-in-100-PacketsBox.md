      <li>It is easy to use and we are very satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>I was glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Sometimes you need more than just a gel for cleaning.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve used these for years and love them.</li>
      <li>and I prefer to carry these better than sanitizer bottles or sprays-</li>
      <li>Also, a research was done on restaurant menus and it was shown that the lower portion of the menus had a lot of germs (some people don&#x27;t wash their hands after using the restroom) and it was safer to handle the menus towards the top.  </li>
      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these wipes.  </li>
      <li>Even though these wipes have expired, they still seem to be ok.  </li>
      <li>I love these better than carrying a bottle of hand sanitizer.</li>
      <li>When I needed more I went online and bought these.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought these.  </li>
      <li>They are really handy to have when I need to clean my hands.</li>
      <li>They really went out their way to ensure I felt good about the purchase.  </li>
      <li>No perfume - just the strong alcohol smell which dissipates quickly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pretty effective when you can&#x27;t get to soap and water.</li>
      <li>Because the interior of each hand wipe is made of foil, these have an incredible lifespan and won&#x27;t dry out easily</li>
      <li>These are great, especially for their price!</li>
      <li>they are primarily alcohol, which is what does the job.</li>
      <li>It is light and compact.  </li>
      <li>We used them on a Scout camping trip as tinder to start the campfire as well as to clean up the boys&#x27; hands and faces.</li>
      <li>Just have a clean amonia smell.</li>
      <li>before you touch your peanuts on a plane...use a Sani-Hands to clean those germs away</li>
      <li>I had the pleasure of using these wipes on a recent American Eagle flight and was happy to find online at such a great price.  </li>
      <li>There are cheaper brands out there, but these are very moist and easy for two persons to use with one packet.  </li>
      <li>This product offers a better value than the name brand alternatives.</li>
      <li>Definitely something nice to have in your car or office.</li>
      <li>Sani-Hands Sanitizing Wipes, at 65.9 percent alcohol, exceed the 60 percent minimum, are very large</li>
      <li>Great to carry in briefcase, especially when traveling internationally.</li>
      <li>Good amount of liquid - not dripping wet but very close to it.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
      <li>Great to use on the go, especially if you take the train daily.  </li>
      <li>I have been meaning to get a box for home since we have a new little one and it would be nice when out of the house to wipe up our hands as is needed before and after many baby maintenance tasks.  </li>
      <li>anyone interested, here is the ingredient list from the box:&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredient:&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol 65.9% by volume</li>
      <li>Good size (5\\&quot;x8\\&quot;) while still being in a small package (2\\&quot; x 2 1/4\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
      <li>It came in a very timely manner also.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so they don&#x27;t take up much room, but they unfold into a decent-size wipe.</li>
      <li>Very convenient.</li>
      <li>and very moist.</li>
      <li>The green ones biodegrade easier or something; the cleaning agent is still good old alcohol based stuff.</li>
      <li>We only use them rarely, and they&#x27;re still fresh.</li>
      <li>They have many other uses</li>
      <li>these are much better than the other brand.  </li>
      <li>we got them for the youth at church to clean their hands before food prep and such.  </li>
      <li>Yet when you open them they are a decent size and have a lot of sanitizer on them so easily clean both your hands twice over.</li>
      <li>These packets are awesome for air travel and inconspicuous restaurant use (not to mention as single use, they are not mistakenly left in the restaurant (with small bottles) as I have done).  </li>
      <li>In addition, if you frequently go for travel, it is very convenient for using it.</li>
      <li>However, the alcohol content of the handrub must be at least 60 percent to be effective.</li>
      <li>The towelettes have a good amount of moisture and allows a few minutes to scrub your hands before they dry out.</li>
      <li>I found them in a big box store and bought my first box there.  </li>
      <li>These wipes are not scented or drying--you can easily put a few in your purse or the glove box of the car.  </li>
      <li>The small packets are easy to take with you.</li>
      <li>They dry off fast with no residual stickiness.  </li>
      <li>Only pure, germ killing, fast drying alcohol with a little fragrance thrown in.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve left these in my car during major heatwaves and direct sunlight, and they&#x27;re still moist on the inside.  </li>
      <li>Small enough to fit anywhere on bike or in luggage.  </li>
      <li>Because my husband and I usually go to buffets quite often, I depend on SANI-HANDS to wipe my hands before I start eating my meals because so many people touch the serving utensils and, due to my health, I cannot take any chances of various germs on my hands getting onto my eating utensils or any finger food I might have.  </li>
      <li>Large enough towelette to rip in half and share.</li>
      <li>They are heavy and strong enough to wipe down a surface if you need to, as well as your hands and face!</li>

<li> Can&#x27;t say that about Wet Ones.</li>
<li> Not much to say about that.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We use this product prior to in home INR test to determine how thin or thick your blood is. With the results the clinic or hospital can regulate the amount of medication you take. It is easy to use and we are very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s what you do -- put these in your glove compartment with disposable gloves. You will look weird when you pump gas -- but you won&#x27;t smell like fuel or get Lord knows what crud on your hands. Out amongst humanity you need to germ proof your hands -- escalators, handrails, doorknobs  -- I&#x27;m telling you that if we could see the germs we would scream ---carry these Sani-Hands with you.</li>
    <li> I already bought it twice. They are convenient to use. Especially on beach, or during hiking, when washing hand is not easy.</li>
    <li> I bought a big box of these several years ago.  We only use them rarely, and they&#x27;re still fresh.</li>
    <li> These are great for in the car or in my purse and also my picnic bag, love using them no nasty smell either.  Great for after picking trash for our adopted highway too!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these wipes.  They don&#x27;t smell like baby wipeds. Just have a clean amonia smell. I keep them in the car and my purse.</li>
    <li> Bought these to take when went on two-week motorcycle camping trip.  Works great to keep the hands cleaned after cooking, cleaning, or getting grime off the hands when finished washing mud off of bike or doing repairs.  Small enough to fit anywhere on bike or in luggage.  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> We like the size and ease of use and the price.&lt;br /&gt;These are hard to find in a local store.</li>
    <li> According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hand sanitizer is considered as effective at killing germs as washing your hands with soap and water, unless hands are visibly soiled. However, the alcohol content of the handrub must be at least 60 percent to be effective. Sani-Hands Sanitizing Wipes, at 65.9 percent alcohol, exceed the 60 percent minimum, are very large (7.75x5.0 in.) and very moist. The small packets are easy to take with you. They are perfect when dining out as you can clense your hands right before dining. They have many other uses and I don&#x27;t leave home without them. They are inexpensive and very easy to order through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Excellent wipes with alcohol. No fancy chemicals, prooven way to disinfect. Those are correct size and work great as cleaning tool as well.</li>
    <li> These are great, especially for their price! I carry some in my purse all the time and they come in handy a lot, like at picnics. Also cheaper than a lot of the other options I saw on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t be without these guys. They are small packets so fit in a small purse or pocket. Yet when you open them they are a decent size and have a lot of sanitizer on them so easily clean both your hands twice over. I also like them because they don&#x27;t contain benzalkonium, which I am allergic to - they are primarily alcohol, which is what does the job. But they also have aloe so are not overly drying. They make a version which is about twice the size and also a kid&#x27;s version. It&#x27;s a good company!</li>
    <li> These are ideal for those occasions you need to wash your hands but there is no water available.  I carry some in my purse always!</li>
    <li> Bought these for travel in SE Asia.  I don&#x27;t use sanitizers, but wanted a multi-purpose product for the trip.  They are great because they don&#x27;t leave residue on our hands like gel hand sanitizers do. Large enough towelette to rip in half and share. We also used them to wipe silverware and dishes when we were in areas with poor sanitation(like the place in Indonesia where the chickens stood in the dishwashing sink!)  I carry a few in my car and purse. Very good product!</li>
    <li> Great to carry in briefcase, especially when traveling internationally. No goopy sticky feeling, has plenty of moisture. I use them to wipe the armrests and lap tray on airplanes; lots of germs there they say.</li>
    <li> All very good, I am very happy with all my purchases trough Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;Dick Matthews</li>
    <li> Very convenient. Works as advertised. The paper helps scrub off any grime on your hands. The towelettes have a good amount of moisture and allows a few minutes to scrub your hands before they dry out. Pretty effective when you can&#x27;t get to soap and water.</li>
    <li> For some reason these seem difficult to find now that my local Costco stopped carrying them.  Because the interior of each hand wipe is made of foil, these have an incredible lifespan and won&#x27;t dry out easily (I&#x27;m glaring at my dried-out box of Purell handwipes as I write this).  I&#x27;ve left these in my car during major heatwaves and direct sunlight, and they&#x27;re still moist on the inside.  These come in very handy for cleaning hands before meals (or if you get something sticky on your hands) while on the go.</li>
    <li> These wipes are basically alcohol soaked paper hand towels.  There is no perfume, hand conditioner or other stuff.  Now that is not a detriment, but an advantage.  Only pure, germ killing, fast drying alcohol with a little fragrance thrown in.  They dry off fast with no residual stickiness.  Obviously, you are warned to keep them away from open flames as they are quite flammable.  We used them on a Scout camping trip as tinder to start the campfire as well as to clean up the boys&#x27; hands and faces.</li>
    <li> product was just as I hoped it would be. It came in a very timely manner also.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this vendor.</li>
    <li> This product offers a better value than the name brand alternatives. These wipes are every bit as good as any we have used. They smell good, too.</li>
    <li> As the rating says, I like it.  It came when ordered and the product performs as promised.</li>
    <li> Even though these wipes have expired, they still seem to be ok.  The packing job, though, was not so good...box was crushed and torn due to sloppy packing.</li>
    <li> I have these in my purse all the time. They are really handy to have when I need to clean my hands. I use them all the time.</li>
    <li> just a really great handy thing to carry around!</li>
    <li> I looked all over for this product after having finished the last of the previous package we had purchased at Costco.  Costco no longer carried it, so I googled it and found some local stores which, according to them, had it.  They didn&#x27;t.  Some time passed, and I decided to try again.  This time I found Amazon carrying through another vendor.  I was delighted.  It came but the packaging had been crushed in the mail, so I wrote a review about that. Later the vendor contacted me to refund the price of the package and the shipping cost.  They really went out their way to ensure I felt good about the purchase.  I have always felt good about the product.  I was pleased I wrote the original review and feel very good about correcting it now.</li>
    <li> I love these things!  I have them in my purse, car, truck and in my saddle bags!  I found them in a big box store and bought my first box there.  When I needed more I went online and bought these.  They are heavy and strong enough to wipe down a surface if you need to, as well as your hands and face!</li>
    <li> I had the pleasure of using these wipes on a recent American Eagle flight and was happy to find online at such a great price.  Definitely something nice to have in your car or office.</li>
    <li> these are much better than the other brand.  I haven&#x27;t come across a dried out pack.  Unlike the other brand I had dried out packs a lot.  They might be cheaper but what use is there if it was dried out.  Will definitely reorder these.  Great to use on the go, especially if you take the train daily.  The handleS of all the trains are gruesome!  I love these better than carrying a bottle of hand sanitizer.</li>
    <li> These wipe packages are perfect for the car, pocket, purse, etc. They don&#x27;t dry out like the canister wipes or baby wipe dispensers. They are small packages (sized like a condom package) so they don&#x27;t take up much room, but they unfold into a decent-size wipe. They are pleasantly scented as well. Sometimes you need more than just a gel for cleaning. These do the trick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not Detective Monk, but I am a bit of a germiphobe.  Sani-hands wipes are a bit more expensive than hand sanitizer, but it dries out my hands and the scent is sometimes overpowering.  These wipes are not scented or drying--you can easily put a few in your purse or the glove box of the car.  I first bought them at a membership only, big-box store, but have had a hard time finding them since.  I was glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I usually carry with me, small liquid sanitizer bottles.  These packets are awesome for air travel and inconspicuous restaurant use (not to mention as single use, they are not mistakenly left in the restaurant (with small bottles) as I have done).  There are cheaper brands out there, but these are very moist and easy for two persons to use with one packet.  I have not used other products, so I can&#x27;t compare them.  Although, pricier than others, I was very happy with the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> These are equally usable as the GermX wipes.  Use in Airplanes, Resturants and after shaking hands with anyone.</li>
    <li> we got them for the youth at church to clean their hands before food prep and such.  They work well.  I have been meaning to get a box for home since we have a new little one and it would be nice when out of the house to wipe up our hands as is needed before and after many baby maintenance tasks.  good wipes.</li>
    <li> Actually in  a green package now, and comes in a ziploc style bag instead of a cardboard box now. The green ones biodegrade easier or something; the cleaning agent is still good old alcohol based stuff.</li>
    <li> The product is good for sanitizing the hands before meals.  In addition, if you frequently go for travel, it is very convenient for using it. It is light and compact.  I really love this product.</li>
    <li> Because my husband and I usually go to buffets quite often, I depend on SANI-HANDS to wipe my hands before I start eating my meals because so many people touch the serving utensils and, due to my health, I cannot take any chances of various germs on my hands getting onto my eating utensils or any finger food I might have.  Also, a research was done on restaurant menus and it was shown that the lower portion of the menus had a lot of germs (some people don&#x27;t wash their hands after using the restroom) and it was safer to handle the menus towards the top.  Because my husband and I also eat at various restaurants, I, again, use my SANI-WIPES for my protection.  Even my husband asks me to hand him a SANI-WIPE so he can also sanitize his hands.  SANI-WIPES also come in handy after he fills the gas tanks of our vehicles with gasoline to get that residue and smell off his hands.  I always keep plenty of SANI-WIPES in my purse and in our cars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought these.  Here is what I like about them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Texture is not too papery but is not that fuzzy texture that I have seen with other wipes.  Has the perfect texture to remove grime instead of just spreading it around.&lt;br /&gt;2. Good amount of liquid - not dripping wet but very close to it.&lt;br /&gt;3. Sturdy packages that hold up to being carried around without drying out.&lt;br /&gt;4. Good size (5\\&quot;x8\\&quot;) while still being in a small package (2\\&quot; x 2 1/4\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;5. Does not leave your skin excessively dry but also does not leave any sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;6. No perfume - just the strong alcohol smell which dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone interested, here is the ingredient list from the box:&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredient:&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol 65.9% by volume&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Propylene glycol, Glycerin, Carbomer, Aminomethyl propanol, Alow barbadensis leaf juice, Tocopheryl acetate.</li>
    <li> I bought these at Costco several years ago and they don&#x27;t sell them there anymore.  On the inside, they are a sani-wipe.  Not much to say about that.  The thing I like about them is that they don&#x27;t get micro-holes and dry out.  They STAY MOIST in the packet.  Can&#x27;t say that about Wet Ones.</li>
    <li> Best way to prevent flu when traveling...think about everything you touch...and the germs...before you touch your peanuts on a plane...use a Sani-Hands to clean those germs away</li>
    <li> I travel quite a bit (airplanes, developing world) and I never go without these! They don&#x27;t dry out your hand and I prefer to carry these better than sanitizer bottles or sprays- this just feels cleaner. i am sensitive to smells, and I don&#x27;t think this has any unpleasant odor. i was so disappointed when Costco stopped carrying this, but so glad i can find them here!</li>
    <li> A great portable wipe.  We&#x27;ve used these for years and love them.</li>
