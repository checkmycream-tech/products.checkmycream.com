      <li>I purchased this product to get more shine in my hair and it has helped to relieve the dullness.</li>
      <li>My sister gifted me this product at Christmas and paid much more for it at a salon.  </li>
      <li>I kept touching my hair... will def buy again.</li>
      <li>If you shampoo more often, you might need to use the product more often as well.</li>
      <li>So, I can&#x27;t tell you whether it would require additional applications if you wash more than twice per week.  </li>
      <li>Makes the blow out so easy and hair looks so healthy.</li>
      <li>This is easy to use and leaves my aging hair more manageable and thicker feeling.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or gooey; and Amazon has it for the best price anywhere -- far cheaper than Drugstore.com&#x27;s Beauty.com, where I bought it the first time.  </li>
      <li>It is very good in the dry winter indoor humidity.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and colored and have a lot of breakage.</li>
      <li>does it give my fine hair strength, control and shine</li>
      <li>how it looked like I had just got fresh highlights!</li>
      <li>I was sooo excited to get</li>
      <li>Or even better, one of those really crappy bottles of conditioner you get from motels.</li>
      <li>A+ shopping experience; top quality product; super fast service.</li>
      <li>Wanted something to use upon shampooing to help bring out color &amp; calm frizz.</li>
      <li>, I use it to calm my frizz as well as bring out my color</li>
      <li>I recently bought the 3 minute shine, I really liked it.  </li>
      <li>It certainly makes a huge difference for me and hair looks amazing flat ironed!!</li>
      <li>I really didnt want to spend so much on a full bottle but thought it would be worth it.</li>
      <li>not only looked gorgeous but ultra soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>This is definitely one of the better vendors.</li>
      <li>My first impression using this product was when I came in for just a trim, my stylist used this</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>I love the product, not only</li>
      <li>It works pretty well, however it&#x27;s pretty pricey.</li>
      <li>and I really noticed a difference after my first try.</li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;m of a &#x27;certain age&#x27;</li>
      <li>She says it&#x27;s a pretty decent stuff and recommends it.</li>
      <li>I try to keep it in my hair for around 10 min to really let it absorb.</li>
      <li>I really like Alterna Caviar products.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I did recommend this to a friend that has straight hair and she loves it too.</li>
      <li>but once I buy the full size bottles, they are completely different.</li>
      <li>I have better results from just putting a tiny dab of pure coconut oil in my dry hair.</li>
      <li>I bought it with high hopes after using a sample I received.</li>
      <li>I just started using this and after one use my dull looking Hair had a nice shine to it ,This is not ment to be used as a Conditioner you use this after washing and conditioning your Hair than put this on ,I keep this on for 3-5 minutes rinse and style</li>
      <li>Unless you have VERY dry hair in dire need of shine, one should really consider whether or not the cost is truly worth it.</li>
      <li>It gives my fine oily hair lots of shine without weighing it down or making it oilier.</li>
      <li>I would compare it to a $1 (or less) bottle of cheap conditioner from the grocery store.</li>
      <li>Though the shampoo and conditioner were very pricey, I thought maybe I could receive a similar effect from this shine boost.  </li>
      <li>My hair is shiny and soft.</li>
      <li>My hair felt so silky and soft.</li>
      <li>how the shine last through the whole day.</li>
      <li>it gives the hair a shine that looks completely natural.  </li>
      <li>This product leaves out a lot of nasty additives (many, but not all), does not weigh hair down, and makes it much more silky and smooth in one use.</li>
      <li>This product didn&#x27;t due much of either.  </li>
      <li>when I don&#x27;t flat iron &amp; to wear my natural curls.</li>
      <li>You use it after you condition your hair and my hair felt less soft, less smooth, and definitely didn&#x27;t seem any shinier.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is super thick and creamy.</li>

<li> I like the product because a little goes a long way and you don&#x27;t have to use it everyday to achieve the shine or keep the shine.</li>
<li> It is supposed to last 7 days but by the end of the week, the effect has decreased and I like to use the product every 5 days or so.</li>
<li> This is my first bad review on a product.</li>
<li> Not only does that look tacky, but they drew the line horizontally instead of vertically, rendering it useless in their attempt to disrupt the scan bar.</li>
<li> This product adds shine to my over processed and dull hair.</li>
<li> My hair is thick, course, wiry, greying though i color it</li>
<li> I have thin frizzy wavy colored</li>
<li> May be just because she wasn&#x27;t overexcited...</li>
<li> I have thin hair but lots of it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m really confused by all the reviews on this site and others with people saying it made there hair feel soft because it made mine feel horrible:-( I guess what works for some don&#x27;t work for others.</li>
<li> but I am always disappointed.</li>
<li> I was totally disappointed.</li>

    <li> The product was received in a timely manner, and in great condition. It works pretty well, however it&#x27;s pretty pricey. Unless you have VERY dry hair in dire need of shine, one should really consider whether or not the cost is truly worth it. It DID do what it was meant to to do. My hair is shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> NOT THE SAME PRODUCT IN TUBE THAT I ALWAYS USE</li>
    <li> This is junk. I bought it with high hopes after using a sample I received. The sample was amazing. I really didnt want to spend so much on a full bottle but thought it would be worth it. I have used it many times always thinking it will do something but I am always disappointed. I would compare it to a $1 (or less) bottle of cheap conditioner from the grocery store. Or even better, one of those really crappy bottles of conditioner you get from motels. It does NOTHING. No softness, no shine and lots of tangles.  On the subject of samples... I have received multiple samples from a health and beauty website. The majority of these samples are amazing products but once I buy the full size bottles, they are completely different. I cannot figure this out. Is it just a scam?</li>
    <li> I bought this at my hair dressers insistence. I was totally disappointed. It basically did nothing for my hair. My hair is fine and colored and have a lot of breakage. I have better results from just putting a tiny dab of pure coconut oil in my dry hair. (gives awesome shine!)</li>
    <li> This is my first bad review on a product. I was sooo excited to get and I did receive it in a great timely manner. The packing was nice and sealed. I have thin frizzy wavy colored hair(bright red). I&#x27;m really confused by all the reviews on this site and others with people saying it made there hair feel soft because it made mine feel horrible:-( I guess what works for some don&#x27;t work for others. I tried.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says. It gives my fine oily hair lots of shine without weighing it down or making it oilier. It only has to be used once or twice a week. I&#x27;ve gone through several bottles and will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Wanted something to use upon shampooing to help bring out color &amp; calm frizz. This product didn&#x27;t due much of either.  Will stick with Caviar&#x27;s Overnight Repair, I use it to calm my frizz as well as bring out my color when I don&#x27;t flat iron &amp; to wear my natural curls.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to get more shine in my hair and it has helped to relieve the dullness. I have been very pleased with it and I will keep using it for now</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of the better vendors. A+ shopping experience; top quality product; super fast service. I would recommend them without reservation.</li>
    <li> Wow, one of the best conditions I&#x27;ve ever used. This stuff is super thick and creamy. I used it about 1-2 a week when my hair is feeling a bit dry. I try to keep it in my hair for around 10 min to really let it absorb. My hair felt so silky and soft. I kept touching my hair... will def buy again.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use and leaves my aging hair more manageable and thicker feeling.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very mild but pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I get tons of compliments on my hair when i use this. You get that just left the salon feel and look.</li>
    <li> Great product!  This helps seal the hair with softness and shine.  Makes the blow out so easy and hair looks so healthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised the amount of negative reviews. I have thin hair but lots of it. I get highlights about once every 6 to 8 weeks. My first impression using this product was when I came in for just a trim, my stylist used this and I was blown away how it looked like I had just got fresh highlights! I get blonde/brown colors and my color not only looked gorgeous but ultra soft and shiny. The only thing I can imagine is maybe some users are using the product as a conditioner? It is intended as an added bonus to your already shampooed &amp; conditioned hair. It certainly makes a huge difference for me and hair looks amazing flat ironed!!</li>
    <li> This product leaves out a lot of nasty additives (many, but not all), does not weigh hair down, and makes it much more silky and smooth in one use. It is supposed to last 7 days but by the end of the week, the effect has decreased and I like to use the product every 5 days or so. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and this keeps the fuzz out. I did recommend this to a friend that has straight hair and she loves it too. It is very good in the dry winter indoor humidity.</li>
    <li> I like the product because a little goes a long way and you don&#x27;t have to use it everyday to achieve the shine or keep the shine.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of the caviar shampoo and conditioner.  After one use, I noticed a difference in my hair.  Though the shampoo and conditioner were very pricey, I thought maybe I could receive a similar effect from this shine boost.  Well, I was underwhelmed.  You use it after you condition your hair and my hair felt less soft, less smooth, and definitely didn&#x27;t seem any shinier.  I saw no difference with this product and will try to return it.</li>
    <li> I just started using this and after one use my dull looking Hair had a nice shine to it ,This is not ment to be used as a Conditioner you use this after washing and conditioning your Hair than put this on ,I keep this on for 3-5 minutes rinse and style and i am amazed how the shine last through the whole day.I will be using this once a week .</li>
    <li> My sister gifted me this product at Christmas and paid much more for it at a salon.  It works as well as the conditioners found in boxes of hair color.  My only criticism is that they used a Sharpie line through the UPC code in an attempt to discourage resale of the product.  Not only does that look tacky, but they drew the line horizontally instead of vertically, rendering it useless in their attempt to disrupt the scan bar.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, and it&#x27;s no lie:  it gives the hair a shine that looks completely natural.  Now that I&#x27;m of a &#x27;certain age&#x27; I shampoo twice a week; I use Shine Boost once a week, and the shine lasts till the next application.  So, I can&#x27;t tell you whether it would require additional applications if you wash more than twice per week.  The product doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or gooey; and Amazon has it for the best price anywhere -- far cheaper than Drugstore.com&#x27;s Beauty.com, where I bought it the first time.  I recently bought my second tube of it through Amazon, and will keep buying it from Amazon.  One tube lasts me around 4 months, but again, that&#x27;s with shampooing twice per week and using the product only once per week.  If you shampoo more often, you might need to use the product more often as well.</li>
    <li> I am surprised at the negative comments.  I love the product, not only does it give my fine hair strength, control and shine, it is most impressive with reviving my color.</li>
    <li> I tried this product last week. It did the trick. I used it again last night, did the trick again.  This took away any and all frizz, it immediately strenghtens the hair follicle the minute you apply it. I could feel the change.  I proceeded with my styling lotion to blow  the hair out, and then flat ironed it.  Perfect when i got up this morning, i didnt have to do a thing to it. It is a glaze and is very healthy for the hair.  My hair is thick, course, wiry, greying though i color it, this does the trick for seeing me thru until the next stylist appointment. I go every 8 weeks.  This is week 6. Try it, i love it.</li>
    <li> I do not use it myself but bought it for my wife. She says it&#x27;s a pretty decent stuff and recommends it. Why 4 stars? May be just because she wasn&#x27;t overexcited...</li>
    <li> I really like Alterna Caviar products. This product adds shine to my over processed and dull hair. Would recommend highlighted hair.</li>
    <li> I recently bought the 3 minute shine, I really liked it.  It is truly anti-aging.  I got manageability, sheen and softness.  I&#x27;m in my mid forties and I do color and highlights every six weeks and I really noticed a difference after my first try.</li>
