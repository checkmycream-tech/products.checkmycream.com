### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Calendula Ointment is great!!)</li>
      <li>The ointment worked well, just need alot of it for the eczema breakout I had but someone bought the cream for me in the store &amp; that one tube cleared my skin &amp; stopped the itching for good!</li>
      <li>The lady at the health store said that this was good.  </li>
      <li>Amazing ointment -</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a super great product out also works great on all skin conditions even psoriasis of the scalp I wish they made huge container of this stuff</li>
      <li>The best on the market if you&#x27;re looking for natural healing formulas instead of the commercialized products like Neosporin.</li>
      <li>Works well and arrived very quickly!</li>
      <li>I tended to use the heavier ointment more and because of that</li>
      <li>Love Boron.</li>
      <li>I continue to use the lighter cream and love it.</li>
      <li>but I couldn&#x27;t get anyone to understand me &amp; after many emails that contact my contact number NOBODY called to talk to me, then after I returned my item they missplaced my return.  </li>
      <li>I use a hand fan to make sure to remove all moisture and then I generously apply the calendula ointment to the affected area.  </li>
      <li>Love this ointment for healing all sorts of skin conditions.</li>
      <li>I use this on my toddlers mostly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for another ointment that I used many years ago.  </li>
      <li>It is amazing for quickly curing diaper rash.  </li>
      <li>Discreet and excellent for burns and dry areas</li>
      <li>Calendula is fabulous stuff.</li>
      <li>I first used it in Mexico and so glad it&#x27;s sold through Amazon.</li>
      <li>love this first aid cream.  </li>
      <li>It heals their skin quickly and the scars are almost nonexistent.  </li>
      <li>The ointment is really greasy but works like a charm!!  </li>
      <li>The most amazing this is that I am a Type 1 diabetic and typically heal very slowly- not with this.  </li>
      <li>I make sure that the area is clean and dry...</li>
      <li>First I give my toddler a baking soda bath (lukewarm bath with one cup baking soda).  </li>
      <li>I really like calendula products, they sooth and calm skin conditions.  </li>
      <li>However, this ointment didn&#x27;t seem any better than regular Aquaphor which is much cheaper.  </li>
      <li>It works really well.  </li>
      <li>I use this stuff on my cracked feet &amp; it works very well.</li>
      <li>My girls even said this much better than the other ointment that starts with a &amp;#34;N&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Same basic thing except this is more water-resistant and works very well also.</li>
      <li>When I notice my eczema starting to flare up or notice that my knuckles are getting drier than normal, I dab a small amount on my hands (usually when I&#x27;m at home as the greasiness is not so pleasant at work or out) and by the next morning I can see a huge improvement.  </li>
      <li>Its gentle on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film like other first aid creams..</li>
      <li>Apply the Calendula ointment on her hands and arms right away, but a wet sock over her hand and up her arm (make sure sock isn&#x27;t too tight i.e. leaves marks when you take it off), then put a dry sock over the wet sock and keep on for 3-5 hours.  </li>
      <li>I use it for my four year old&#x27;s scrapes and scratches, rashes and bug bites, and even for dry lips.</li>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than in the stores an it came sooner than expected it&#x27;s a super great product out also works great on all skin conditions even psoriasis of the scalp I wish they made huge container of this stuff I&#x27;d spend money for a jar with lots in it cuz these are medium sized but they still pack the potency of an ointment you see on commercials especially scars</li>
    <li> I use this stuff on my cracked feet &amp; it works very well.</li>
    <li> Love this ointment for healing all sorts of skin conditions. I use it for my four year old&#x27;s scrapes and scratches, rashes and bug bites, and even for dry lips. Works well and arrived very quickly!</li>
    <li> I use this for EVERYTHING! Rash babies, pimples, dry skin, hang nails, cuticles, EVERYTHING! burns... etc. Love Boron.</li>
    <li> I purchased this ointment to be used on some patches of eczema that I occasionally have on my knuckles.  The ointment is really greasy but works like a charm!!  When I notice my eczema starting to flare up or notice that my knuckles are getting drier than normal, I dab a small amount on my hands (usually when I&#x27;m at home as the greasiness is not so pleasant at work or out) and by the next morning I can see a huge improvement.  It also stops the eczema itch.  And it only takes a tiny dab!  Would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I will never purchase another item from AmericanWholesale again, their customer service is the worst, you can only contact them via email (no number to call at all), I tried to explian my reason of returning this item ((don&#x27;t get me wrong the product Calendula Ointment is great!!)( I will go to the health food store for now on))  but I couldn&#x27;t get anyone to understand me &amp; after many emails that contact my contact number NOBODY called to talk to me, then after I returned my item they missplaced my return.  If someone called me we could have resolved my issue in one day vs. 1 month.</li>
    <li> See my review under Boiron&#x27;s listing for their GEL product.  Same basic thing except this is more water-resistant and works very well also.</li>
    <li> works well on cuts and scrapes</li>
    <li> I got a pretty bad scratch on my leg.  It got very infected, hot , red, swollen and painful.  I used this for 2 days and could not believe the difference. Swelling gone.  Pain diminished.  I told my ND that neosporin wasn&#x27;t doing anything and she told me to try this.  The most amazing this is that I am a Type 1 diabetic and typically heal very slowly- not with this.  I will keep it onhand from now on.</li>

    <li> I really like calendula products, they sooth and calm skin conditions.  However, this ointment didn&#x27;t seem any better than regular Aquaphor which is much cheaper.  The tube is quite small, and didn&#x27;t seem concentrated Calendula.</li>
    <li> When I was undergoing radiation treatment, this ointment along with the cream version was given out liberally by my radiation oncologist.  I tended to use the heavier ointment more and because of that, I had very little skin problems arising from the radiation treatment.  Amazing ointment - I would recommend it to anyone with skin issues.  I continue to use the lighter cream and love it.</li>
    <li> I use this for my daughter&#x27;s Eczema when we do &amp;#34;wet wraps&amp;#34; on her hands and arms at night.  First I give my toddler a baking soda bath (lukewarm bath with one cup baking soda).  Have her soak for 15-20 minutes.  Apply the Calendula ointment on her hands and arms right away, but a wet sock over her hand and up her arm (make sure sock isn&#x27;t too tight i.e. leaves marks when you take it off), then put a dry sock over the wet sock and keep on for 3-5 hours.  I re-wet the wet sock when needed (every 3 hours) and repeat the process for sleeping at night.  It works really well.  My only complaint is that the ointment goes fast when you use it like I do.</li>
    <li> I first used it in Mexico and so glad it&#x27;s sold through Amazon. It&#x27;s not oily, nor gives a smell. Discreet and excellent for burns and dry areas</li>
    <li> love this first aid cream.  Its gentle on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film like other first aid creams..</li>
    <li> This product is a &amp;#34;miracle worker&amp;#34; for the healing of pierced ears.  For months, I used antibiotic ointment that did not result in healing.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for another ointment that I used many years ago.  The lady at the health store said that this was good.  I tried and only use this now.  My girls even said this much better than the other ointment that starts with a &amp;#34;N&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have used this for all three of my kids.  It is amazing for quickly curing diaper rash.  I make sure that the area is clean and dry...I use a hand fan to make sure to remove all moisture and then I generously apply the calendula ointment to the affected area.  This treatment has cured the rash overnight!  You know how painful diaper rash can be for your little ones!  This is the miracle treatment for diaper rash!  I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> Calendula is fabulous stuff.</li>
