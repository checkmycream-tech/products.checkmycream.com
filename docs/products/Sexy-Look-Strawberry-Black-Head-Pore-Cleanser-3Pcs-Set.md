      <li>The blackhead mask smells just like delicious strawberries.</li>

      <li>Also the product smells SO GOOD!</li>
      <li>good!</li>
      <li>but my skin feels great</li>
      <li>good purchase cause</li>
      <li>Totally FAIR comment here------did not work at all.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good product</li>
      <li>Is really good works well like bubz said</li>
      <li>quite good.</li>
      <li>But the smell is nice.</li>
      <li>It is decent at best, but no miracle worker.</li>
      <li>When applying, it does tend to get goopy after a while, and isn&#x27;t a very smooth application.</li>
      <li>Product does the job (the strawberry smell is really strong), but I feel kind of ripped off.</li>
      <li>Great set and super fun!</li>
      <li>#34;save up&amp;#34; some blackheads so it can pull it out more.</li>
      <li>This stuff does work :) go it for my brother, just wish i read the language it is in (went by the pictures)</li>
      <li>The box says to peel from the bottom going up, but I found it removes more junk if I peel from top to bottom.</li>
      <li>hope do more jobs</li>
      <li>my nurse and myself LOVE using this.</li>
      <li>It has nice package but not as useful as I</li>
      <li>feel smooth after use it</li>
      <li>Works well but leaves my pores huge and super oily.</li>
      <li>shake the number 2 mask bottles, then apply with clean finger tip to where you need to clean out your pores.</li>
      <li>The plus side is that it&#x27;s pink and smells good :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll just say the expensive strips, plus it smells good and who doesn&#x27;t want a good smelling skin care product :)</li>
      <li>so I would need to keep reloading on the liquid for the full 2 min massage.</li>
      <li>If you live in a warm area or it&#x27;s summer and hot, sit in front of a fan.</li>
      <li>, I would say it&#x27;s worth a try nothing ventured</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a fun thing to do on a rainy day, or to pick-up your spirits.  </li>
      <li>didt worth it for 18.00</li>
      <li>It doesnt work as good as expected but it smells like strawberry</li>
      <li>For the price it&#x27;s well worth a try</li>
      <li>I been using this stuff over 3 years at first</li>
      <li>The first couple of times I used it, it did manage to pull out some gunk, but after the first couple of times, it didn&#x27;t pull out anything.</li>
      <li>Just be sure to order a month ahead of when you need it because it is shipping from an asian country.</li>
      <li>Its good at getting dead skin off, and the product moisturizes the nose (</li>
      <li>The first bottle also dries out really fast while you&#x27;re massaging it into your skin</li>
      <li>you won&#x27;t see amazing results you will see a few</li>
      <li>it did so much.</li>
      <li>(I used for like 5 minutes to really soften the sebum and any plugs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So much junk came out of my pores.</li>
      <li>The whole set smells like strawberries and the scent lingers on the skin for a post nose strip princess feeling.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really relaxing with the strawberry scent.  </li>
      <li>It was okay at first, but it&#x27;s not worth the price I paid for it.</li>
      <li>I use this as a full facial mask instead of just my blackhead area.  </li>
      <li>Definitely works better than regular nosepack strips.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product to help cleanse my blackheads, but it wasn&#x27;t all that it cut out to be.</li>
      <li>But we must do it seriously in accordance with the instructions on the steps to be effective.</li>
      <li>Since then I only use my daily face cleaner to keep my face clean now I reuse it to maintain blackheads from reappearing on the surface.</li>
      <li>After it&#x27;s good and dry, peel it off slowly.</li>
      <li>It does tend to run out of the tube every time I open it, so I have to make sure to open it upside down making sure the product doesn&#x27;t go everywhere or is wasted.</li>
      <li>If you you put a light coating of it on it breaks apart while drying &amp; you have a 100 little air bubbles that you never you had.</li>
      <li>It absorbs a little more dirt and oil than Biore but the difference is not very obvious.</li>
      <li>I have Biore and Boscia pore strips as well, this product hurts as much and works not so different than Biore but is stronger than Boscia.</li>
      <li>then when you go to take it off no black heads come off.</li>
      <li>Unlike biore, this product full fits his nose, and for me it can get any little blocked pores around my chin.</li>
      <li>it smells great and usually after using something like this I would be breaking out like crazy for the attempt to clean the pores out</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super difficult to smooth around -- it smears but won&#x27;t stay where you smeared it.</li>
      <li>The mask itself takes forever to dry (literally, over half an hour!), and even then it doesn&#x27;t dry hard enough to actually pull anything out, and that&#x27;s after you figure out the perfect layer amount to use in the first place.</li>
      <li>/&gt;3- after the mask is all removed, massage bottle 3 liquid into the skin as an astringent to kill bacteria and also to calm the skin down so your face doesn&#x27;t start weeping oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>: 1) massage with pore dirts softener for easy removal 2) apply thick coat of mask 3)</li>
      <li>The only downside to this is that the first and third bottles need to be cut open.</li>
      <li>Mine personally is very annoying and doesn&#x27;t allow my pores to clean out easily though this product does have the stuff you put on first to open them if you have stubborn pores</li>

<li> it&#x27;s gentler than Biore and my nose doesn&#x27;t get all red and dry after using it.&lt;br</li>
<li> this product doesn&#x27;t work for my skin but after using it 5 times my black heads came completely off</li>
<li> , I do not know my pores are so many dirty things, I will repurchase.</li>
<li> The regime doesn&#x27;t take long</li>
<li> This kit works only as well as any other blackhead peel off mask I have tried.</li>
<li> Rinse with water and pat dry.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t last that long for me since I use it for the entire face, but for the price, it&#x27;s definitely less than a lot of other peeling masks out there that doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
<li> If u put too much of pink mask on it takes forever to dry</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not sure how long it&#x27;ll last thus</li>
<li> but it still come back after few days.</li>
<li> little bit of the black heads came out with the strip.&lt;br /&gt;the rest remain the same.</li>
<li> I think this product is like any other it depends on skin types.</li>
<li> It did pull out some black head for me but not a whole bunch.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to describe; it&#x27;s like it pulls back on itself.</li>
<li> Not worth it.</li>
<li> The size is also very small, only 20 ml for the serum bottles.</li>
<li> is waiting is a little bit long (always 30mins average, and depending on how thick you put on, may take longer)&lt;br</li>
<li> Definitely a must try if you have tough unmanageable skin.</li>
<li> Waste of money &amp; I will buy it again.</li>
<li> Dont waste your time or money.</li>
<li> /&gt;i used a lot of other product to reduce black head, it is not fair to say they are working,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
<li> yes I&#x27;m about to try it out as an all over mask ) but not a great \\&quot;black heads solution\\&quot;</li>
<li> Also when you take it off whether you pull slowly or rip it off like a bandaid it hurts either way.</li>
<li> did work that much, and the gel is very hard to put it on:(  </li>
<li> Not only did it not work, the learning curve for how to apply it is terrible.</li>
<li> can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s expensive or not.</li>

    <li> So, this stuff is awesome. So much junk came out of my pores. For those that can&#x27;t read the instructions I&#x27;ll write them below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- use the bottle labeled 1, put the liquid over where you plan to use the pore mask and massage in for 2-3 minutes. Rinse with water and pat dry. (I used for like 5 minutes to really soften the sebum and any plugs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- shake the number 2 mask bottles, then apply with clean finger tip to where you need to clean out your pores. Leave it on for 20-30 min. If you live in a warm area or it&#x27;s summer and hot, sit in front of a fan. This way you don&#x27;t start sweating under the mask. After it&#x27;s good and dry, peel it off slowly. The box says to peel from the bottom going up, but I found it removes more junk if I peel from top to bottom. Also, I apply it with upward strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3- after the mask is all removed, massage bottle 3 liquid into the skin as an astringent to kill bacteria and also to calm the skin down so your face doesn&#x27;t start weeping oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my nurse and myself LOVE using this. Unlike biore, this product full fits his nose, and for me it can get any little blocked pores around my chin.</li>
    <li> It doesnt work as good as expected but it smells like strawberry</li>
    <li> did work that much, and the gel is very hard to put it on:(  didt worth it for 18.00</li>
    <li> I bought this as a cheaper alternative to the St. Clare brand of the same 3 step-type sebum set. Not only did it not work, the learning curve for how to apply it is terrible. The mask itself takes forever to dry (literally, over half an hour!), and even then it doesn&#x27;t dry hard enough to actually pull anything out, and that&#x27;s after you figure out the perfect layer amount to use in the first place. It&#x27;s super difficult to smooth around -- it smears but won&#x27;t stay where you smeared it. It&#x27;s hard to describe; it&#x27;s like it pulls back on itself. Basically, it&#x27;s no biore replacement. The size is also very small, only 20 ml for the serum bottles. The plus side is that it&#x27;s pink and smells good :)</li>
    <li> Great set and super fun!</li>
    <li> It has nice package but not as useful as I thought.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend people to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Only little bit of the black heads came out with the strip.&lt;br /&gt;the rest remain the same.</li>
    <li> This product may not \\&quot;do it\\&quot; for blackheads but it&#x27;s a fun thing to do on a rainy day, or to pick-up your spirits.  The whole set smells like strawberries and the scent lingers on the skin for a post nose strip princess feeling. The regime doesn&#x27;t take long and it&#x27;s really relaxing with the strawberry scent.  Its good at getting dead skin off, and the product moisturizes the nose ( so...yes I&#x27;m about to try it out as an all over mask ) but not a great \\&quot;black heads solution\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This kit works only as well as any other blackhead peel off mask I have tried. It is decent at best, but no miracle worker. I give it 3 stars though because it smells wonderful, and who doesn&#x27;t appreciate that?</li>
    <li> This stuff does work :) go it for my brother, just wish i read the language it is in (went by the pictures)</li>
    <li> Is really good works well like bubz said</li>
    <li> I finish using one box of this and I have to admit skin is 10x smoother than before. I use this as a full facial mask instead of just my blackhead area.  I use this after using my clarisonic mia 2 times a week. The only downside to this is that the first and third bottles need to be cut open. The first bottle also dries out really fast while you&#x27;re massaging it into your skin so I would need to keep reloading on the liquid for the full 2 min massage. Definitely a must try if you have tough unmanageable skin. It doesn&#x27;t last that long for me since I use it for the entire face, but for the price, it&#x27;s definitely less than a lot of other peeling masks out there that doesn&#x27;t work as well. Just be sure to order a month ahead of when you need it because it is shipping from an asian country.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product to help cleanse my blackheads, but it wasn&#x27;t all that it cut out to be. The blackhead mask smells just like delicious strawberries. It does tend to run out of the tube every time I open it, so I have to make sure to open it upside down making sure the product doesn&#x27;t go everywhere or is wasted. When applying, it does tend to get goopy after a while, and isn&#x27;t a very smooth application. The first couple of times I used it, it did manage to pull out some gunk, but after the first couple of times, it didn&#x27;t pull out anything. Overall, this product just didn&#x27;t work for me in the long run. It was okay at first, but it&#x27;s not worth the price I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I been using this stuff over 3 years at first I&#x27;m like this product doesn&#x27;t work for my skin but after using it 5 times my black heads came completely off I was like omg my blackheads are GONE !! Since then I only use my daily face cleaner to keep my face clean now I reuse it to maintain blackheads from reappearing on the surface.</li>
    <li> All the dirts and blackheads were removed with the mask! Definitely works better than regular nosepack strips. Follow the steps: 1) massage with pore dirts softener for easy removal 2) apply thick coat of mask 3) apply pore tightening essence after peeling the mask off</li>
    <li> I think this product is like any other it depends on skin types. Mine personally is very annoying and doesn&#x27;t allow my pores to clean out easily though this product does have the stuff you put on first to open them if you have stubborn pores you won&#x27;t see amazing results you will see a few here n there but nothing to write about. it smells great and usually after using something like this I would be breaking out like crazy for the attempt to clean the pores out but my skin feels great, I would say it&#x27;s worth a try nothing ventured is nothing gained it&#x27;s a good product just isn&#x27;t a OMG it did so much. For the price it&#x27;s well worth a try over I&#x27;ll just say the expensive strips, plus it smells good and who doesn&#x27;t want a good smelling skin care product :)</li>
    <li> part of it smells like glue. I try it total three times. Totally FAIR comment here------did not work at all. Not worth it. Dont waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> If I could give it zero stars I would have. I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference after using this. If u put too much of pink mask on it takes forever to dry then when you go to take it off no black heads come off. If you you put a light coating of it on it breaks apart while drying &amp; you have a 100 little air bubbles that you never you had. Also when you take it off whether you pull slowly or rip it off like a bandaid it hurts either way. Waste of money &amp; I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works well but leaves my pores huge and super oily.</li>
    <li> I guess it does what it suppose to. It did pull out some black head for me but not a whole bunch. I guess I have to &amp;#34;save up&amp;#34; some blackheads so it can pull it out more. Also the product smells SO GOOD! Smells just like strawberry~</li>
    <li> I have Biore and Boscia pore strips as well, this product hurts as much and works not so different than Biore but is stronger than Boscia. It absorbs a little more dirt and oil than Biore but the difference is not very obvious. Also I&#x27;ve used this only once so I&#x27;m not sure how long it&#x27;ll last thus can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s expensive or not. But I think it&#x27;s good purchase cause it&#x27;s gentler than Biore and my nose doesn&#x27;t get all red and dry after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effective, sexylook&#x3D;biore&gt;boscia&lt;br /&gt;Gentle, boscia&gt;sexylook&gt;biore</li>
    <li> Used just once, didn&#x27;t work at all. But the smell is nice.</li>
    <li> quite good. feel smooth after use it but it still come back after few days. but it works. hope do more jobs</li>
    <li> This mask is very good, there was a strawberry flavor, I like strawberry flavor!Before you use it, I do not know my pores are so many dirty things, I will repurchase.But we must do it seriously in accordance with the instructions on the steps to be effective.</li>
    <li> there was a tv show (taiwan tv show) recommend this product,&lt;br /&gt;so i started to my search on internet, then find it in amazon.&lt;br /&gt;i used a lot of other product to reduce black head, it is not fair to say they are working,&lt;br /&gt;but this product works the best. very good attachment to your skin since it is creamy liquid when you applied,&lt;br /&gt;it can cover all corners of your nose vey well.&lt;br /&gt;cons is waiting is a little bit long (always 30mins average, and depending on how thick you put on, may take longer)&lt;br /&gt;smells good!</li>
    <li> Product does the job (the strawberry smell is really strong), but I feel kind of ripped off. On the package there was a cardboard wrapping around the box that said &amp;#34;buy one get one free&amp;#34; in Chinese so I feel like I missed out on something.</li>
