<li> I&#x27;m seeing a lot of improvement when other products haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
<li> had hoped this would do a good job because I hate dealing with Proactiv and being required to order kits on a recurring basis, but this just wasn&#x27;t up to par in the least.</li>
<li> I bought this for my boyfriend who has pretty bad back acne.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
<li> I shower everyday and use this, but I cannot say this product provided any improvement.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive and made me break out more red and painful pimples!</li>
<li> No more breakouts.  </li>
<li> Some of the pimples would get very big and painful.</li>
<li> there- not only has this stopped her worst breakouts, it has also helped with the dark spots and blackheads!!  </li>
<li> Grrrr, I think of all the money and time I wasted.</li>
<li> My 14 year old has been with struggling with horrible &amp;#34;bacne&amp;#34; for 2 years, and we&#x27;ve tried every wash and system out</li>
<li> Expensive</li>
<li> She went off the pill and her skin went crazy.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have suffered with severe acne my entire life, ever since I was 9 (I&#x27;m 25 now) and I have yet to find an acne product that is aggressive enough to fight my acne on my chest and back. I bought this stuff with a lot of doubt in my mind because it has &amp;#34;natural elements&amp;#34; in it, and anything that I used previously that was natural didn&#x27;t work at all. I was VERY surprised when I noticed a &#x27;dent&#x27; in my acne a week later, and my sensitive skin wasn&#x27;t flaking. Admittedly I don&#x27;t use it every day, even though I should, so my acne isn&#x27;t 100% gone. But by golly, I am loving this stuff, and I am loving the fact that my skin is clearer than ever before, and I don&#x27;t even have to use harsh chemicals!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I am currently on my 3rd bottle. I use it as a face and body wash.</li>
    <li> The smell is good which gets it two stars, but after using it for 3 weeks I find the only way I&#x27;m getting results is by using Proactiv body pads as well... as in the body pads are the only thing that get the results.  I actually think the spots on my shoulder and back got worse when using only this product but can&#x27;t be certain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had hoped this would do a good job because I hate dealing with Proactiv and being required to order kits on a recurring basis, but this just wasn&#x27;t up to par in the least.</li>
    <li> i like the smell. after 3 weeks of using this product i saw a difference on my chest and shoulders. still no difference on my back.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SO MUCH WORKS LIKE A CHARM very very amuse from this indeed I am I will&lt;br /&gt;Be buying again</li>
    <li> Expensive but it works so so what.  Over the past 18 months my skin has had a mind of it own.  Break out after break out.  Tried several products nothing worked.  Went to the dr for antibiotics but even those had minimal success.&lt;br /&gt;Give this 2 weeks before passing judgment.  I also bought a activated charcoal sponge to go hand in hand with the exposed skincare&lt;br /&gt;I got the works and am glad i ordered every product bc they all play their part thanks exposed skincare</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my son. He loves it. And what&#x27;s really important his shoulders and back are clearing up.</li>
    <li> I use the kit and this product and I never have breakouts anymore....I tried many and I am so happy to have found a product that cured my acne. Grrrr, I think of all the money and time I wasted. Don&#x27;t waste either and just buy there products and follow the very easy instructions. Thank you Exposed creators....</li>
    <li> so great!! you must use it for more than two weeks to see results, but the results are impressively amazing</li>
    <li> The product smells minty refreshing. It does not dry the skin, its composition feels good on the skin is not aggressive. Calm but actually calms skin while not gone through full granites. Maybe should accompany with any changes or diet more ... Would buy the product again yes!.</li>
    <li> In my 40s and getting back acne, especially in the summer.  Tried several store products and even Rx from dermatologist.  Nothing worked. Started wading with Exposed and by the second week I started to see a big difference. No more breakouts.  It&#x27;s non drying too.  I used it in conjunction with a salisic topical.  Really impressed with the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She went off the pill and her skin went crazy.  She now has acne on her back and chest.  So far it has helped.  She has sensitive skin and so far it hasn&#x27;t irritated her skin.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all for me.. Not to say that it will not work for you. I shower everyday and use this, but I cannot say this product provided any improvement.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, got the acne off my back! In love.. Ordering more soon! Would recommend to anyone who has mild to moderate back acne.</li>
    <li> Only giving it three stars because i bought it then literally found out i was pregnant after soo couldnt use it lol and still can&#x27;t because i am nursing!</li>
    <li> I religiously use this body wash. i break out easily on my upper back. Within 1 week I saw results!</li>
    <li> Has cleared my backne almost completely. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and it&#x27;s cleared breakouts on my back that I&#x27;ve been trying to get ride of since I was a teenager. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> This really works!!!! Really, Really!!</li>
    <li> I think its just not for my skin because I broke out in hives. But smells very good.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!  Seeing results after 2 weeks!!!</li>
    <li> When you use it, there&#x27;s a noticable difference. Dermatologist was trying to put me on accutane but i decided to try more over the counter products first and am glad i did.</li>
    <li> Works great awesome price</li>
    <li> Thank goodness for this body wash!  My 14 year old has been with struggling with horrible &amp;#34;bacne&amp;#34; for 2 years, and we&#x27;ve tried every wash and system out there- not only has this stopped her worst breakouts, it has also helped with the dark spots and blackheads!!  She&#x27;s happy- and she wore a strapless dress to MS graduation with a clear back. THANK YOU EXPOSED SKIN CARE!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and it seems to have a small affect so far.  He has only been using for a short period so maybe with  longer use the affects will be better.  We are not giving up on it yet.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product but unfortunately rather than helping increased my back acne! It&#x27;s expensive and made me break out more red and painful pimples!</li>
    <li> My back and chest were covered in breakouts and with the warmer weather I did not want to spend the summer trying to hide my breakouts.  I use a little bit of this body wash every morning on my back and chest and they cleared right up!</li>
    <li> Works better than anything I&#x27;ve used before.  Will be using it from now on.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who has pretty bad back acne. It breaks out in large patches mostly on his lower back area leaving large dark spots for 2 weeks afterwards. Some of the pimples would get very big and painful. He&#x27;s been using this body wash for about two months now. The acne hasn&#x27;t cleared up completely but the breakouts are much smaller in area and less frequent. Also he isn&#x27;t getting any of the large/painful pimples anymore. I think the body wash does a good job of treating the acne without drying out the skin. I&#x27;m seeing a lot of improvement when other products haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my acne.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband. Seemed to work pretty quickly, but even after using for a while, not completely gone. Still, very noticeable difference.</li>
