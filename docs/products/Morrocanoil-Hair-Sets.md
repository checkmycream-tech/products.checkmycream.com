<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best volumizing shampoo/conditioner I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Did not like this, it dried my hair out, made it wispy and fly away. It was recommended by my hairdresser, I actually gave them to her and she was nice enough to give me another brand that Works better on my hair. Amazon&#x27;s delivery was terrific.</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Max123</li>
    <li> great product - arrived on time and as expected&lt;br /&gt;i love Moroccanoil</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner smell amazing and feel great in my hair. A little goes a long way, which is especially good for conditioner which I tend to run through. I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic volume change, but my hair is feeling soft and healthy. Downside is the price and relatively small size.  Note: I have a lot of curly hair, it is fine and a little damaged.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. You only need 1/4 of the amount of other shampoos, and it smells amazing. my shampoo was broken open when I got it. It wasn&#x27;t bad enough to return it though</li>
    <li> Perfect product, perfect delivery. Thrilled!</li>
    <li> I tried this because of the generally good ratings I read.  I have very fine hair and have been using Nioxin for years.  I am not impressed with what this does in the way of &amp;#34;extra volume&amp;#34; and will return to using Nioxin.  The conditioner definitely weighed my hair down which is NOT what I am looking for in an extra volume product.</li>
    <li> Moroccanoil products are great. I only wished it smelled like the hydrating shampoo and conditioner. Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo - conditioner a bit too perfumed - but the shampoo rocks.  The conditioner also seems to cut down on the volume-effect.</li>
    <li> I really like their oil and after using Fekkai for along time I decided I needed a change so I went with Moroccan oil&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner and I was very pleased! My blowout felt really nice and voluminous and it even lasted a little longer. I know it&#x27;s pricey so I use this when I&#x27;m actually going to blow dry my hair or want it done nicely, I&#x27;ll use the store sulfate free stuff if I&#x27;m just going to put it in a bun. One more thing, I knew it was worth it the moment before I started to blow dry my hair my curls had naturally dried a little and they looked great! usually it&#x27;s frizzy but they looked so healthy!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner does volumize, but makes my scalp feel unbearably itchy.  I bought and will not be using any more.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of fine hair, it&#x27;s very very sick but fine nonetheless. And my hair tends to get very oily. I personally love the shampoo and how it made my hair feel. It gave it volume without drying it out. However shortly after using the shampoo I noticed my shoulders, back and chest started breaking out. I would have loved to continue using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and have trouble finding products that do not weigh it down. This shampoo and conditioner are great for my fine hair and the smell is strong but pleasant. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo, but think the conditioner makes my hair soft, need more body in my hair.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner are great products.  Your hair will feel so smooth after using.  When using the shampoo, though you need to add water to get it to lather in your hair.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner. Makes my hair easy to comb out and style.</li>
    <li> Very good product and smells beautiful.</li>
    <li> My hair was dull and flat. I tried many shampoos and conditioners before trying Moroccanoil Extra Volume Shampoo and Coditioner. Wow! What a difference. Excellent body and wonderful shine. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell. Product does exactly what it says it does....adds volume to my thinning hair. I&#x27;m nearly 50 years old and my hair has been thinning due to my age and hormonal changes taking place. I love this product, it gives me the confidence to wear my own natural hair and not be embarrassed about the thinning hair that is growing thicker with each wash.</li>
    <li> My husband always comments on how good my hair smells when I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo gives my hair great body and helps with dryness from coloring my hair.</li>
    <li> not sure if I will order this again. I do not see that it adds much volume. It seemed to have given my hair less volume.</li>
    <li> While a house guest in the very Southern part of the United States, this duo was generously provided by my hostess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the way my hair behaved and responded to styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having heavily highlighted hair, I rely on my own products.  But the Moroccanoil Extra Volume Shampoo and Conditioner were amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming back North, I wondered if it could have been the water supply at her home.  Nonetheless, I went for purchasing this set and hoping for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is quality.  After a few days of using it, my hair is just lovely and responding well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all shampoos and conditioners, it is good to switch off once in a while.  However, the end result of using Moroccanoil is exceptional.  Light fragrance, no harsh cleaning agents, low sudsing...it is A plus!</li>
    <li> everyone should have these. I ahve to admit they are a little expensive but well worth it. i just don&#x27;t use mine every day. my grandaughters have thick curly hair and the cream rinse is a miracle worker!!!</li>
    <li> Love this!!!! Smells great.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It smell good and leaves my hair soft and healthy.  No need to use much.  Product lathers great.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping,  great products</li>
    <li> Not so sure... It smells nice but it doesn&#x27;t lather. It also does not leave hair as shiny or silky as the original Moroccan oil shampoo and conditioner does. Had me questioning if it&#x27;s authentic or if I just received a bad batch...</li>
    <li> Not what I expected from this line, which I have been using for years.  Will not buy it again, left hair drab.</li>
    <li> Loved the shampoo and the conditioner. The smell is amazing and it does give you volume to your hair</li>
    <li> this is not the real Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner. So disappointed from this product.I  will never purchase from this seller!</li>
    <li> I love these products.  Not only do they have a delicious aroma, but they really make my hair more manageable and gives it body.</li>
    <li> Wow...bouncy hair!  Love the smell.  Glad I got it</li>
    <li> The product is good. But I found the conditioner has been used.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is really nice. The shampoo though, its really THICK, almost impossible to get through all your hair. ;/ The product itself it pretty nice, but I bought a different Moroccanoil from Sallys cheaper and works better.</li>
    <li> I have absolutly nothing bad to say about any of the Moroccan oil shampoos and conditioners.  This product has been the best thing EVER for my hair.  I have very fine delicate long hair and it is hard to keep it in good shape.  When I started using this product, my hair has broken and dry.  After suing this product, almost immediately I could see and feel a huge difference.  Over a short period of time, my hair dresser was impressed with the excellent condition of my hair and how healthy it was.  My hair has never looked healthier and it feels great!  It is also safe for any hair extensions you may be wearing as well. I will never stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I have very fine thin hair and it definitely makes it feel thicker.  Smells wonderful too!</li>
    <li> I used the conditioner at a friends house and fell in love so I bought the 1L of it and I am disappointed in this product. The shampoo is very hard to spread over your hair and it makes it feel very dry and straw like. Hair does not feel clean afterwards. Will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> These products are worth the money.  My hair is looking so much better.  I ordered all the products for fine hair.  I found a great hair product for my hair</li>
    <li> These are the  best and  the safest products I have ever used. My hair is left full, soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I only had used it for three times so I haven´t seen results but I know the brand and I trust it is going to give my hair volume that no other  shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  picture of the product didn´t show me the real size of the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I don´t know much about measures ,so I thought it was bigger, they are  too small for my needs .</li>
    <li> This was advertised as a set, but only the conditioner came in.  I got a credit really quickly, but had to order the shampoo from a different entity.  I like the product, but it wasn&#x27;t the miracle I had hoped for in giving my hair volume.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and cream rinse. My stylist recommended it and I have used it ever since. Arrived in good shape and on time.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Love the texture &amp; smell it leaves my hair. Will definately buy again!</li>
    <li> The duo of shampoo and condition stengthens the hair from the root out and yet is light and lifting in volume.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is exactly what I wanted.  Love it and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My hair feels great when using the shampoo and conditioner together. My hair seemed to have more fullness to it. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> Great Product. I have been using it for 2 years. It gives my fine hair the extra body I have been wishing for over the years. I have tried lots of products and this has by far worked the best.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with dry frizzy hair for years. After trying product after product, a friend told me about Moroccanoil.  Nothing else had made much of a difference,  so I went ahead and tried this product.  Incredible! My hair changed after using it for the first time! I have used it now exclusively and it has made my hair soft, no frizz but full of body and shinny. I would recommend this shampoo and conditioner to anyone even if you don&#x27;t have frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat them!!! This product is not to heavy but makes your hair feel amazing!!!  If you ever have any damage the Moroccan oil mask are unbelievable!!</li>
    <li> this product just makes my hair fell healthy</li>
    <li> I normally buy these at the salon, and I was told there that if I buy it anywhere else, it will not be the real product. I was tempted by the lower price, and ordered it here. The shampoo did not have as nice scent as the first one I bought at the salon. I have finished using this product purchased here, but I will buy it at the salon only next time. The consistency and the scent were not as the original. I agree with previous opinions that this might be a counterfeit product. Also, the box leaked when I received it, so some of the shampoo was gone.</li>
    <li> Love this product, because I have fine, thin hair.....this does give me more volume, but the salons in California can&#x27;t sell it here anymore!  :-(&lt;br /&gt;Glad to find it on line.  I buy it whenever I drive to another state.</li>
    <li> I love this product does great with  my hair I have long blonde hair and it smells wonderful. Leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> I have used the original Moroccanoil products for several years and they are superb.  Have also tried other companies versions with moroccanoil and have been very disappointed.  They can not compare to the &amp;#34;original&#x27;. Worth the price for results.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair shiny and manageable.  Love it.  Great for Holiday gifts.</li>
    <li> All the old shampoo/conditioners have been replaced by these products. The best moisturizing duo for my naturally gray hair</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this for volume.  My hair is fine and permed; it is really dry using this product.  Will go back to the hydrating shampoo and conditioner.  It smells better too.</li>
    <li> This combo works very well for fine/limp hair.  After chemo when my hair grew back, it was very thin and fine.  These products are about the only ones that help build volume.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever tried! Will stick with this line and planning on buying more items soon. I&#x27;ve tried alot and have enough stuff to stock a Trade Secret! Well, almost. HA</li>
    <li> item as described, shipped fast</li>
    <li> THis made my hair very soft and added more volume.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. It is the best.</li>
    <li> Not happy with the product at all. It made my hair look greasy, nasty and it doesnt give any shine to it. I&#x27;m very dissapointed.:(</li>
    <li> thickened my hair but weighed it down, too, so don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again--&lt;br /&gt;need more words for this review so here</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner for my fine hair...especially in the humidity of the south!  Product and shipping as expected from seller.</li>
    <li> Perfect for fine hair. Great smell!</li>
    <li> My hair was silky smooth and smelled wonderful.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> this product fells great on my hair and isn&#x27;t too heavy feeling. Makes my hair so shiny and silky but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Love this!!!</li>
    <li> I Love This Stuff!!!  The fragrance is unbeatable an my hair feels like I just came from the salon each time I use it.  Totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> The liquid leaked out the bottle and the shipping box was soaked. The supplied did not check to ensure the tops were screwed on tight.</li>
    <li> I really love-love-love the Conditioner and will buy it again..... but the shampoo, nah....not a fan.  Didn&#x27;t like the smell nor the texture of the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner.  It is weightless in your hair.  I will definitely buy these products again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fine, limp hair, to give it volume.  If anything, it made my hair look thinner, with no volume at all.  It made my hair MUCH too soft, which is great for thick hair, not fine hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It smell wonderful.  Your hair feels so soft after you use it. The volume gives you a lift and I have very flat hair</li>
    <li> why not list all the info before i fork out my money for product?? I really love this product, works well on fine hair, good volume and shine at same time.</li>
    <li> I find that I have to use more shampoo then when I use the restorative shampoo.  I also prefer the sent of the other in comparison to this one, though it does not have a bad scent.  My hair is thin and thinning and I have not found it to be more full due to the shampoo.  I do like how my hair lays when air dried.  Not as frizzy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner has a light scent.  I find my hair does not get oily as fast as it does on the restorative products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I would buy this again as I don&#x27;t see any major improvement and you use more.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST shampoo &amp; conditioner by far! My hair has never looked healthier.</li>
    <li> The only bad thing I can say about this product is I wish it came in bigger bottles, 8.5 oz doesn&#x27;t last very long. But this product is great even for the price, my hair is normally very fine and thin, this product smoothed my hair and made it incredibly soft! I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent combination. Great service.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Moroccan oil products. This is a diluted or otherwise adulterated version. THIS IS NOT THE REAL THING. So sad. I wonder who thinks, &amp;#34;Hey, I think I&#x27;m gonna pour some crap shampoo in this awesome shampoo&#x27;s bottle and sell it?&amp;#34; Really?!</li>
    <li> As to some comments about lathering shampoo lathers because of chemicals and soaps this is all free of that u are getting a gd clean on all of the hair.. I use shampoo condition intense hydrating mask (once a week) ohhhh my god it&#x27;s fantastic!! Then ghd heat protection then Morrocan oil then frizz spray I style then spray two pumps of glimmer spray onto my brush and brush above my ear not straight onto my roots then when there not to much product on my brush then go to the roots.my hair is amazing so shiney soft and always getting touched.this can get annoying ;) I&#x27;m asked what do I use do I tell them? no!! Never let ur beauty secrets out lol!!  not unless they vist my bathroom :). I must say I have used used shop brought products before and I can honestly say I never will buy these again as I use half throw away and buy new stuff as I was not happy with the products these are pricey but a little does go a loooong way :) and u get what u pay for quality over quantity is now a law I live by!!</li>
    <li> After reading all the 5 star reviews on this product, I had to try it. My hair has been unusually dry and tangled lately. When I used the shampoo this morning, I honestly thought it was going to make matters worse. I just wasn&#x27;t getting much moisture out of it, but as soon as I used the conditioner, my worries subsided. My hair was instantly manageable and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Heavenly smell&lt;br /&gt;Silky, managable hair&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Moderate volume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pricey (but well worth it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this product again in the larger size.</li>
    <li> I have very fine and oily hair and I expected more from this shampoo especially for the cost. It didn&#x27;t give me any more volume or softness that I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo &amp; conditioner set after over a year ago I had gone through liter bottles of the set. During that time, I was regularly highlighting my hair and had overall blonde (and dry) hair. So this stuff was amazing for that style of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that my hair is medium length, and top half is my natural light brown, and the bottom half is my grown out blonde highlights, I have mixed feelings about this set. My natural brown hair finds this product far too heavy, After using these products, I blow dry my hair and my roots feel heavy. Towards the ends, its nice and healthy, I assume the oils saturate my dry, brittle blonde ends. But for natural hair, I would advise using sparingly. Also to note, I alternate this S&amp;C with Traders Joes Tea Tree Oil S&amp;C which is very cleansing and removes any buildup, every time.</li>
    <li> best shampoo in the world.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this is the best product I have ever used. A little goes a long way. I have short hair and I wash my hair 3 time a week and it lasts 10 months</li>
    <li> My hair is so soft and shiny after using this. My hair did feel like straw after the first use but the feeling went away after a few uses. It doesn&#x27;t smell very great in the bottle but my hair smells AMAZING once dried. I really love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like the conditioner more than the shampoo - the shampoo is too thick and doesn&#x27;t &#x27;bubble&#x27; enough for me, but both products rinse out easily and I have noticed my hair is softer, shinier and more manageable.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It leaves a beautiful, soft shine and scent on the hair. However it is too heavy for my fine hair, leaving it weighted down.</li>
    <li> It did not give any volume to my hair.  This shampoo and conditioner was a waste of money.  Don&#x27;t try it.</li>
    <li> I like both the shampoo and conditioner, but the masks are what work best for my hair.  I have thin-medium thickness, half curly, half straight, unruly and limp, so I battle it all!  These work fine; It is an adjustment to get used to &#x27;no lather&#x27;.  But they do leave your hair silky and shiny, not oily or dry.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This was the second time I ordered this item. First time I really liked the product but this time the shampoo was not the same.&lt;br /&gt;My hair were so dry and frizzy, I think the product was counterfeiter. I remember reading the reviews about this product and did not believe it. Ironically, I went through the same experience.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on me and I kept smelling my hair.  Love the smell had to have it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner ever!&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting, great smelling, no build up ....just lovely smooth and silky hair !</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner combination is great. It leaves your hair feeling soft and manageable and hydrated. It also has a wonderfully refreshing smell. My hairdresser uses it at the salon and I liked it so much that I bought it to use at home.</li>
    <li> Moroccanoil extra volume shampoo and conditioner works perfectly for me, I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and don&#x27;t get the same results.  Extremely happy with it, and love the fact that I can just go online at amazon order it and its here in a few days.</li>
    <li> This particular shampoo and conditioner I didn&#x27;t like.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like it should. I have ordered before and it was great.  I wouldn&#x27;t get the extra volume.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my fine hair look. But, surprisingly, most people will remark how wonderful this shampoo and conditioner smells. I&#x27;ve had so many compliments.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is GREAT! I have fine and oil Lee hair with dry and</li>
    <li> I know they tried to keep the bottels from leaking, but both the shampoo and conditioner leaked all over themselves.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner gave real body and volume to my thinning hair.  I actually feel like my hair is thicker when I shampoo with it, unlike when I use other products.  Love it!</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean and it dries in a dull lifeless hard to style way. Would not purchase again</li>
    <li> I Loved the shampoo and the conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent purchase!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find this product in Brazil ...&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair and this product makes may hair look thicker . I use moroccanoil oil treatment light  as a leave-in .</li>
    <li> Bottles came and looked kinda old. The shampoo I HATE. it doesn&#x27;t lather and I feel like I&#x27;m not washing my hair enough. Cond. is fine. I think it&#x27;s pretty heavy. Probably wouldnt buy both together again</li>
    <li> The smell is really strong. The shampoo made my hair feel like straw. The conditioner was way to heavy for my fine hair and made it really flat and greasy feeling. Couldn&#x27;t use it more than a few days before I gave up on it. Would not buy ever again.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner- smells wonderful and does a great job of adding volume to fine hair while leaving it soft</li>
    <li> Tried many, for many years and THIS is the one you need if you have fine hair. Tried a sample from a beauty shop and was immediately convinced. The scent is long lasting and very nice. yes it&#x27;s pricey, but don&#x27;t need more than a dime size or so to get results on shoulder length hair.  I found that I don&#x27;t even need to shampoo daily as I always did before !  So glad I found this on amazon at this great pricing compared to elsewhere.  Shipping was very prompt as stated.</li>
    <li> Like the conditioner better than the shampoo</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and was sold on the wonderful fragrance.....but with this particular order (the extra volume), I am very disappointed in the fact that there is no fragrance and it seems to be watered down.  I am not happy with this since these are expensive items.  Will not be purchasing items from this particular seller again.</li>
    <li> the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried them ALL!!!! Definitely worth the high price!  BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Moisturizes without making hair heavy or flat! Leaves hair soft, smelling great and full of body. Smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> I always buy this for my girlfriend and she loves it so I guess it is good quality and good outcome. I can say her hair looks beautiful, healthy and shiny...maybe this helps maybe not but she is very happy so....worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It met and exceeded my expectations. My hair feels so soft and smells amazing. I get so many compliments on how my hair smells. I received it very fast. I am 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have been using Moroccanoil products for over 2 years and will never use a different extra volume shampoo and conditioner, luminous strong flexible hold hairspray, hydrating styling cream or hair oil treatment. All products are amazing! The hair oil treatment is a must. A small pea sized amount distributed through your hair after towel drying and then left in keeps your hair soft and shiny throughout the day!!&lt;br /&gt;I have male pattern baldness on the top of my head. I barely have any hair up there and have to wear a human hair wiglet. You would never be able to tell and I wash my human hair piece in Moroccanoil products as well. It stays very soft and manageble along with my own hair. I have found it has made my existing hair stronger and it has less breakage which is very important when I want to keep every strand I have!!&lt;br /&gt;Actually for me the very best part of any of the Moroccanoil products is the scent. As soon as I smell that in the shower I have a permanent smile for the rest of the day!!&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited that Maroccanoil has announced that they are coming out with a beauty line that will include soap and lotions. I&#x27;m sure they will be awesome and of course the smell will be the best selling point!!</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely mannor and I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Great price compared to salons and is a product I will purchase over and over.</li>
    <li> Just received today, first thing I did was smell. NOT the same smell as product sold in Salon. I suspect a knockoff.</li>
    <li> What my salon recommended</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and it came fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> Thanks! It&#x27;s my love))</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner.  Hair smells great, soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  I get many compliments on the way my hair looks and smells.  Love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair and love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner.  It has a great smell, although it is slightly different than their other formulas I&#x27;ve tried.  More woody smelling, like sandlewood, but I like it.  It&#x27;s been great with my oil hair/scalp.  I have been able to cut back to shampooing/conditioning just twice a week from shampooing every other day.  So, even though the product costs more, I&#x27;m using less, so it&#x27;s still a good deal for me.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price for salon quality hair care. Smells wonderful! Have used for well over a year now. Lasts a while.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to scetns and this one really bothered me.</li>
    <li> I have thin fine hair that tends to be really dry no matter what I do.  This stuff is amazing, it makes my hair far shinier than anything else ever has; plus the shine lasts.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t give my hair any volume at all.</li>
    <li> Not worth it.  Doesn&#x27;t make hair feel clean.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Not only does it smell wonderful, it leaves my hair silky smooth, but not too silky that i&#x27;d consider it limp.  love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really think this is the actual product! I am a Moroccan oil junky and have many of their products. All by authorized sellers/hair salons. For some reason this does not seem like the real thing!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife who battles with dry lifeless hair. This made her hair shimmer in a natural looking way and gave it body!&lt;br /&gt;She and I are well pleased. I will buy this regularly for her from now on.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and easy to work with, having curly hair is hard to manage and this makes it easier. Came on time and would buy again,.</li>
    <li> So far I love this shampoo and conditioner-- you get what you pay for with this product. I only use sulfate free shampoos and some can be quite terrible even at higher prices....moroccanoil has perfected all their products to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; and I will continue to purchase their line of products! P.S. I have very long thin hair that goes into shedding mode annually, and this keeps my hair full of volume as well as looking shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> The conditioner smelled funky. Like it was old or something.</li>
    <li> Great product for fine hair.</li>
    <li> It is a perfect shampoo and condioner. My hair has more volume every time  I use it. I am totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great product, rather spendy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my fault for thinking they&#x27;d be bigger at $18 a bottle, I just overlooked the volume measurement. They smell great and work well, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy them again at that price, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> This was everything I expected and more.  It conditions without greasiness and leaves my hair shiny.  I like the smell.</li>
    <li> It smells very well, for about 1,5 days I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair. It&#x27;s good shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t give that extra volume that I expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the exact one that I bought from a salon and cheaper. I love this shampoo and conditioner because my hair is much smoother and healthier since I started using it.</li>
