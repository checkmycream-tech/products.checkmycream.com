      <li>I am sure this one is the best brush in the world!  </li>
      <li>I had never heard of copper being good for dandruff.</li>
      <li>Just give your  hair a good brushing with it, and it will get rid of the flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it feels so good while combing</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good quality</li>
      <li>More people should know about this product!</li>
      <li>It is amazing.....</li>
      <li>Feels great on the scalp &amp; handle is comfortable in the hand.</li>
      <li>original Paul Mitchell 413 Hair Brush was a very nice Brush.</li>
      <li>Dandruff is all gone and it so easy to brush!</li>
      <li>The handle is lovely and it does not tear out my hair.</li>
      <li>While its copper effects I am sure have long-since worn off, I do love how this brush feels against my scalp.  </li>
      <li>When i combine it with this brush i almost never see dandruff any more.  </li>
      <li>I love this brush and I have noticed a difference since using it.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>This is my husbands favorite hairbrush.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size for my long hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this really helps with my psoriasis, but it feels damn good to brush my hair with it.</li>
      <li>Plus he had fine hair like mine.</li>
      <li>Received it very fast!!</li>
      <li>But as a regular hairbrush  It does a nice job on my hair, it looks nice and smooth  </li>
      <li>Like this Goody Brush was not like the original Brush.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush.  </li>
      <li>It does a remarkably good job and removing any lose scales that are left on my scalp after washing.</li>
      <li>Rec&#x27;d quickly &amp; packaged well.  </li>
      <li>, the firm copper bristles also feel really nice, and give your head a nice massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought it 4 years ago at our local store and fell in love with it!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this brush!!!</li>
      <li>I have fine, straight hair, and a lot of it.  </li>
      <li>but they actually feel really nice.</li>
      <li>But man is it worth it.  </li>
      <li>The soft action of the bedding is what makes a good brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At first I was worried that the metal bristles would hurt my head</li>
      <li>This is a nice brush , but it has not really made a difference in the dandruff situation.   </li>
      <li>so it might last for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>copper bristle brushes are hard to find and they were at a good price too</li>
      <li>a scale from 0%-100% for how much i believe this brush alone reduces my dandruff</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would go so far as to say that this brush is just as effective as the shampoo because if i dont use dandruff shampoo and only the brush then the brush alone keeps it to low levels and my head will rarely itch now.  </li>
      <li>This brush is a much healthier way to get rid of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After reading about these new Goody brushes in a magazine, I decided to give it a try -- and it really works!  </li>
      <li>and you actually feel squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I also get dry flaking in the winter, and this brush does all the right things for me!</li>
      <li>We have seen a marked improvement since we have been using them!</li>
      <li>I use it first thing in the morning, and last thing at night.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Oct 2013 rec&#x27;d my 2nd brush,(wore out my 1st), husband now wants one.</li>
      <li>This brush surprised me.  </li>
      <li>I am surprised I have not seen it in stores yet.</li>
      <li>We bought this to replace his old one.</li>
      <li>I was very skeptical but all the reviews seemed great.</li>
      <li>and it was really rough on the first brush.</li>
      <li>But this Therapy Copper Brush really works, and it didn&#x27;t take very long to get results.  </li>
      <li>I was skeptical, but it works amazingly well.</li>

<li> The bedding that the metal bristles go into was very stiff with no give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I had always brought the brushes from Europe, because I could not find here the brush with soft base and metallic teeth that does not create statics.</li>
<li> Was not happy was this product,gave the hair brush away.</li>
<li> I use to have it so bad that my head would itch</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are very fragile and I have to replace them every two to three months.  But man is it worth it.  I used all sorts of products to get rid of the itchiness in my head.  Products helped some, but these copper brushes are the bomb.  I brush thoroughy several times a day, and if my head starts itchy in between.  Itches vanish.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> After reading about these new Goody brushes in a magazine, I decided to give it a try -- and it really works!  After using it just twice a day for four days, my flaky scalp issues disappeared.  To maintain these benefits, I&#x27;m still using it:  I use it first thing in the morning, and last thing at night.  Just give your  hair a good brushing with it, and it will get rid of the flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I&#x27;ve used a coal-tar shampoo to get rid of flakes, but using that always strips my hair color and leaves my hair feeling dry and coarse for days afterwards, even if I deep-condition.  This brush is a much healthier way to get rid of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a warning, you can&#x27;t use this brush when you&#x27;re blow drying your hair since the copper bristles will heat up and can burn your scalp.  I didn&#x27;t know that until I opened the package the brush came in and read all the directions.  I mention this only because I looked all over to get the smaller \\&quot;styling\\&quot; paddle brush (thinking I could use it when blow drying my hair), but any size would have been just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the anti-dandruff properties of this brush, the firm copper bristles also feel really nice, and give your head a nice massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush.  I was skeptical, but it works amazingly well.</li>
    <li> I never answer this stuff.  But this Therapy Copper Brush really works, and it didn&#x27;t take very long to get results.  More people should know about this product!</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush , but it has not really made a difference in the dandruff situation.   That seems to be the same. But as a regular hairbrush  It does a nice job on my hair, it looks nice and smooth  But my dandruff is the same as ever.</li>
    <li> I had always brought the brushes from Europe, because I could not find here the brush with soft base and metallic teeth that does not create statics. Finally, I found the Goody Styling Therapy Copper Styling Brush. I am sure this one is the best brush in the world!  Such a pity I could not find any in the stores!    Dear Goody,  Do you have club for this brush?</li>
    <li> I love this brush and I have noticed a difference since using it. It&#x27;s the perfect size for my long hair. I am surprised I have not seen it in stores yet.</li>
    <li> It started falling apart after a couple of years.  My prior brush lasted well over a decade.  The copper gimmick is just that.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything for dandruff.  A gyp.</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite hairbrush.  We bought this to replace his old one. He won&#x27;t let me buy him anyother hairbrush but this one! Received it very fast!!</li>
    <li> This brush surprised me.  All my life i have suffered with tons of dandruff that is soooooo itchy.. so i use dandruff shampoo, which works great but never stops it all.  When i combine it with this brush i almost never see dandruff any more.  There is still a tiny bit once in a while but it&#x27;s low enough that people would probably never notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would go so far as to say that this brush is just as effective as the shampoo because if i dont use dandruff shampoo and only the brush then the brush alone keeps it to low levels and my head will rarely itch now.  I use to have it so bad that my head would itch and i&#x27;d scratch til it bled and it would still itch. but not any more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a scale from 0%-100% for how much i believe this brush alone reduces my dandruff i would say 85% reduction.  and if i combine shampoo it&#x27;s around 98% gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase again if and when this wears out one day.  it&#x27;s a good quality so it might last for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i did research and it turns out what causes dandruff is a fungus that grows on everyone&#x27;s skin but affects different people to various degrees.  It just so happens that this fungus does not thrive in environments where it is exposed to copper.&lt;br /&gt;If you have noticed copper tends to have a strange taste and smell to it.  i guess that some things find that poisonous.</li>
    <li> i bought this brush thinking i&#x27;d use it for detangling and while blow drying.  read the instructions and they say not to do either.  it is strictly for minimizing dandruff which i don&#x27;t have.  was going to return it, but used it once and it felt great on my scalp.  only reason i decided to keep it and give it any stars.  i don&#x27;t understand why goody calls it a styling brush though, it is not.</li>
    <li> This is actually my second time buying this brush. I bought it 4 years ago at our local store and fell in love with it! I had dandruff when I got it and didn&#x27;t have a problem after using this brush. At first I was worried that the metal bristles would hurt my head but they actually feel really nice. Now I can&#x27;t use any other brush without it hurting my head. The only reason I am having to buy another one is because my hair is really thick and it was really rough on the first brush. I was so sad when they stopped selling it locally but it is actually cheaper to order it from amazon than it was to buy it in store!!! I highly recommend this brush!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you for the great product.</li>
    <li> This brush has somehow managed my dry scalp with just a couple brushes per day.  Great price for a great item.</li>
    <li> Was not happy was this product,gave the hair brush away. These may or may not be a generic. The bedding that the metal bristles go into was very stiff with no give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original Paul Mitchell 413 Hair Brush was a very nice Brush. Bought one of the newer so called Paul Mitchell 413 brushes. Like this Goody Brush was not like the original Brush. The soft action of the bedding is what makes a good brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These spin offs look the same,but are not of the same quality. Seems you get what you pay for. In the future,will buy any hair brushes at a local beauty saloon. Can try before you buy.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d quickly &amp; packaged well.  Feels great on the scalp &amp; handle is comfortable in the hand. Very happy with product &amp; seller.&lt;br /&gt;Oct 2013 rec&#x27;d my 2nd brush,(wore out my 1st), husband now wants one. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a magazine. I was very skeptical but all the reviews seemed great. I tried looking at walmart and target but it is not available anywhere so I took a deep breath and bought it on amazon and paid the S&amp;H.  It is amazing.....it feels so good while combing and you actually feel squeaky clean. These copper bristles work.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of copper being good for dandruff. I use a great hair product and dandruff hasn&#x27;t been a big problem. However my scalp does sometimes itch and then I do have flakes. I just got my brush today and have used it twice already. My scalp feels great while brushing and seems to tingle pleasantly afterward. I will report again later on further effects.</li>
    <li> This is for a gift.  She LOVES these as she said.  She has long hair &amp; uses a brush twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased these for her before.  From what she&#x27;s said they are terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has one too &amp; likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> great buy ! copper bristle brushes are hard to find and they were at a good price too i bought three</li>
    <li> This is the nicest brush I have ever owned. The handle is lovely and it does not tear out my hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these brushes, one for me, and another for my daughter. We have seen a marked improvement since we have been using them!</li>
    <li> I had the Paddle, than found out they made a styling one. Bought it to keep in my travel bag, because my job. A male friend of my was complaining he used everything to get rid of his dandruff. Plus he had fine hair like mine. He had long hair because he does a lot Medieval Fairs and SCA. I bought him one for Xmas and he just loves it! Dandruff is all gone and it so easy to brush!</li>
    <li> This brush is great. While its copper effects I am sure have long-since worn off, I do love how this brush feels against my scalp.  I have fine, straight hair, and a lot of it.  I also get dry flaking in the winter, and this brush does all the right things for me!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this really helps with my psoriasis, but it feels damn good to brush my hair with it. It does a remarkably good job and removing any lose scales that are left on my scalp after washing. I don&#x27;t like to use it to style my hair with, but overall I like this brush.</li>
