      <li>The delivery was very quick.</li>
      <li>Strongly recomend it.</li>

      <li>The red bottle is amazing!</li>

      <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found it on Amazon - and for almost 50% LESS than what they want for it in the salon!</li>
      <li>And it makes it very soft.</li>
      <li>As soon as I start using the original Uniq, my hair feels softer and is way less dry/frizzy.</li>
      <li>After blow drying it left would leave my hair soft and silky for days</li>
      <li>My hair smells like coconut all day long; helps stop the frizz; detangles, moisturize my hair like no other product</li>

<li> As with the other Uniq, when it is half empty the atomizer won&#x27;t work or will be hard to activate.</li>
<li> If you have dry brittle hair and its hard for you to brush out the tangles after washing it I recommend you get this product.</li>
<li> and I am not sure why!</li>

    <li> My hair smells like coconut all day long; helps stop the frizz; detangles, moisturize my hair like no other product</li>
    <li> I have used the product before and I love it. Cheeper than salon and delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> Great smell and leaves hair easy to comb and style.  Let my niece borrow and it did a great job of smoothing out her frizzies.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! A must have!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, smells great, and really leaves my hair baby soft.</li>
    <li> Loved the predecessor in the red bottle but had a masculine smell, this one smells great!  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Already loved Uniq One but HATED the smell- this product was the perfect answer! Feels like I&#x27;m at the beAch all the time with coconut breezes.</li>
    <li> The red one has a better smell</li>
    <li> The best!!!  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I tried it to vary from the Uniq Red, the smell is good at first (right out of the bottle) but after applying it to the hair it does not smell the same way. As with the other Uniq, when it is half empty the atomizer won&#x27;t work or will be hard to activate.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this product and I love it!!  The best product for dry &amp; damaged hair. I put highlights in my hair and my hair remains healthy because of this product.  I hope it&#x27;s never discontinued.</li>
    <li> I love the original red bottle of &amp;#34;Uniq&amp;#34; so I figured I would give the coconut one a shot because I love the smell and its summer time! I found that this one dries out my hair A LOT and I am not sure why! As soon as I start using the original Uniq, my hair feels softer and is way less dry/frizzy. It smells good but does not work well on my hair!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!! I am so glad I found it on Amazon - and for almost 50% LESS than what they want for it in the salon! I highly recommend this product to everyone! I only wash my hair twice a week - Sunday and Thursday - and only with shampoo and so when I get out of the shower, I spray this all over my hair and it is so soft and smells good until I wash it again.</li>
    <li> Buy the red Uniq One bottle instead!  This one doesn&#x27;t even come close.  The red bottle is amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this item!!!  Makes my hair smooth and very shiny.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Really makes hair silky and looking full.</li>
    <li> This has been by far the best live-in treatment for my extremely damaged hair.  After blow drying it left would leave my hair soft and silky for days (I cannot wash my hair every day as my hair is extremely damaged).  I will buy this product as always they sell on Amazon.  I have tried so many expensive, salon-quality name-brand products, paid hundreds of dollars and none have delivered results as this treatment.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love the product!! Love the scent even better!</li>
    <li> love the way it makes my daughter&#x27;s hair smell. And it makes it very soft.</li>
    <li> My hair loves it! I would definitely keep buying it.</li>
    <li> If you have dry brittle hair and its hard for you to brush out the tangles after washing it I recommend you get this product. it stays in stock at my house I love it!</li>
    <li> Great smell.  Eliminates the use of multiple products. Doesn&#x27;t cause static.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Besides this product is very good this new scent is wonderful. The delivery was very quick. Loved.</li>
    <li> Loved this product on my sun/pool dried out hair.  Wish I had it for the entire vacation.</li>
    <li> Has a gorgeous coconut scent, is very light, and does most of the things mentioned on the bottle. It moisturizes,detangles, adds softness and shine. I don&#x27;t use heat on my hair in the summer, so I don&#x27;t know how well it serves as a heat protectant. But this product is really kind to my shoulder length relaxed hair and I will continue to use it in my regimen. :)</li>
    <li> I liked the original Uniq One a little better.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great product with a nice smell. It protects the hair when you blow dry it. Strongly recomend it.</li>
