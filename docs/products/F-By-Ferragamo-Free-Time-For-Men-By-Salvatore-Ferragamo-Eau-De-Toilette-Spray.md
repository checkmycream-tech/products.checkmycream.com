      <li>/&gt;Check this link for a good primer and classification of fragrances.</li>
      <li>Authentic and smells great, amazing price too!</li>
      <li>Most of the perfumes that I bought are very good quality and have never had any kind of complaints about that.</li>
      <li>It is a great scent and I am confident the compliments waiting to happen.  </li>
      <li>It comes out of the bottle with a blast of citrus/lemon, but the beauty is, it settles into a scent of aquatic and citrus that is pleasant without overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>This EDT smells quite nice out the box (FYI:</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own way.  </li>
      <li>smell really nice</li>
      <li>Great summer clean smell.</li>
      <li>great price with fresh and aqua smell</li>
      <li>its a GREAT alternative to the ever soooo popular and over use Acqua Di Gio, Issey Miyaki, 212, and cool waters to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;free time\\</li>
      <li>Before purchasing any fragrance, request samples at the major department stores in your area (Macy&#x27;s, Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, etc. are excellent choices).  </li>
      <li>Great product, fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Fresh and crisp, this a perfectly balanced cologne.</li>
      <li>Well, I bought this for my son, but when I smelled I gifted to my brother.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not an expert at describing notes, but the blue packaging makes perfect sense for the cologne.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed with the fragrance that I have placed it in my Top Ten.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE THE SMELL</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments since I started to use it.</li>
      <li>However, most are Julian-based codes which identify the month, day and week or year of manufacture with a series of letters and/or numbers.  </li>
      <li>but I still love it anyway.</li>
      <li>Not to overwhelming at all.</li>
      <li>I know with most colognes its body chemistry.  </li>
      <li>Most senior sales associates at the stores should be able to obtain this information for you....</li>
      <li>With this in mind, I sampled most of the popular fragrances available and selected Ferragamo F Free Time Eau De Toilette (EDT).  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what words use to explain exactly how good it is,</li>
      <li>This means it may be more challenging to locate or obtain a free sample</li>
      <li>So all in all pretty pleased with this Flanker, and best of all since most of Ferragamo Colognes are totally underrated and probably unheard of,  you won&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like everyone else.</li>
      <li>I like it even more than the original-</li>
      <li>this helps and wishing you a sweet smelling year!</li>
      <li>kaging is first class and the bottle is nicely designed.  </li>
      <li>packaging is first class and the bottle is nicely designed.  </li>
      <li>A bit cumbersome, but unique and easy on the eyes.  </li>
      <li>A bit cumbersome, but unique and easy on the eyes.  </li>
      <li>Free Time is easy on the nose and unique in</li>
      <li>Best choice for everyday use.</li>
      <li>It is great and a nice soft summer scent, not to loud and fruity.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another beauty about Free Time is the price/value.  </li>
      <li>Given the type of fragrance, I would suggest that Free Time is a summer scent, but for any occasion.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is fantastic and for the money - go for it..</li>
      <li>The fragrance is fantastic and for the money - go for it..</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Free</li>
      <li>Bought this at duty shop free in Japan it was $60 a bottle for 1.7Fl</li>
      <li>Very good would recommend to other buyers</li>
      <li>&quot; starts off with a blast of grapefruits and lemons, and stays that way for quite some time, and if your familiar with Ferragamo colognes you know that each one has that signature pepper scent.</li>
      <li>It has unique smell.</li>
      <li>I tested it, and ordered the significantly cheaper version from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>The smell is still true.</li>
      <li>Store in a cool room at all</li>
      <li>My brother loved the scent and will continue to purchase it in the future!</li>
      <li>Store in a cool room at all</li>
      <li>Loved it so much that I had to get a new bottle.</li>
      <li>Research has shown that EDT&#x27;s that possess more delicate scents (i.e. \\&quot;notes\\&quot; in the lexicon of many manufacturers), tend to be both preferred and remembered compared with fragrances having stronger or more potent scents.</li>
      <li>Although sold in many upscale US department stores, its marketing and promotion remains tepid compared to many of its competitors with larger promotional and marketing budgets.  </li>
      <li>Since this item has been discontinued, vendors will be quick to sell these units-oldest stock first!  </li>
      <li>Last long and smells great!</li>
      <li>I am giving it to a relative: it may smell better on him!</li>
      <li>Most men&#x27;s fragrances are either too conspicuous and \\&quot;in-your-face\\&quot; strong or have peculiar notes that change based upon one&#x27;s individual body chemistry.  </li>
      <li>better way to come back than with Free Time..</li>
      <li>For those who have not tried Ferragamo fragrances, go for it - perhaps a best kept secret.  </li>
      <li>They will often help you decipher their date code to insure that you are purchasing fresh product.</li>
      <li>Okay well i guess i&#x27;m showing a little bit more enthusiasm</li>
      <li>This is because, like many things used frequently and consistently, your body may \\&quot;adapt\\&quot; to the fragrance over time and you may find that you need to use more of the EDT to obtain the same level of effect.  </li>
      <li>Most EDT&#x27;s should last 1-2 years from DOM (date of manufacture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>This Is my first time I bought fragrance with out test</li>
      <li>cologne is a definite must try for those who love Aquatic/citrus scents.</li>
      <li>When package arrived I open and spray on it my boyfriend he just love it also, so u don&#x27;t have to spend lots of money on buy some where else.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not too light but not overpowering either, and it&#x27;s got lots of interesting notes that remind me of soft woods, dark florals, and (somehow) water.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Longevity is just average about 4 to 6 hours, projection could be better, but most aquatic scents dont tend to last anyways.</li>
      <li>It also arrived extremely fast through the mail.</li>
      <li>THE SENT IS VERY PLESENT</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>final tally for Free Time is 4.5 stars out of 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Stays with me the whole day.</li>
      <li>final tally for Free Time is 4.5 stars out of 5 stars.</li>
      <li>then i really should be, but</li>
      <li>A local retailer claimed to be selling the original to justify a very high markup.  </li>
      <li>I just wish my game were better..!!</li>
      <li>The same is true of medications and supplements.  </li>
      <li>Its unique delicate citrus, marine and gentle floral notes remains distinctive in the huge fragrance arena and will set you apart from the rest of the pack.  </li>
      <li>I am exceedingly particular when it comes to selecting a men&#x27;s fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
      <li>Tried this on a few times at some retail stores and really enjoyed it.</li>
      <li>the prfeume is ok but it doesnt last long for a day.after spraying</li>
      <li>Sweetie likes it, but she prefers the more heavy leathery, spicy, or woodsy scents.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s crowd-safe, and a great go-to option for casual wear.  </li>
      <li>Keep it in the short grass, right..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Tried this on a few times at some retail stores and really enjoyed it. Stays with me the whole day. Its a great summer scent too. Amazon was selling the 3.4 oz bottle for considerably less than the retail stores were charging for the 1.7 oz bottle. It also arrived extremely fast through the mail. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> It is definitely not my favorite. I know with most colognes its body chemistry.  I am giving it to a relative: it may smell better on him!</li>
    <li> Citrus blast and on the lots side.</li>
    <li> SOME SAY THIS ISN&#x27;T LINGERING THEREFORE FALSE OR FAKE...REMEMBER THIS IS &amp;#34;EDT&amp;#34;  NOT &amp;#34;EDP&amp;#34;In perfumes, the acronym EDT stands for &amp;#34;eau de toilette.&amp;#34; The other acronyms in perfumes, EDP, A/S and EDC, stand for &amp;#34;eau de parfum,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;aftershave&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;eau de cologne,&amp;#34; respectively. The strength of the fragrances from strongest to weakest is: EDP, EDT, EDC and A/S.&lt;br /&gt;I like it for what it is AND what it does.</li>
    <li> the fragant isnot lest longer than before i bougjt at tj maxx,&lt;br /&gt;and the cap of it is not work(not tightly)</li>
    <li> Best choice for everyday use. It has unique smell. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments since I started to use it.</li>
    <li> Well, I bought this for my son, but when I smelled I gifted to my brother. This fragace is so delicious that you can stop smell it. I don&#x27;t know what words use to explain exactly how good it is, the only thing that I can say is that is TOTALLY different. Thanks.</li>
    <li> MUST HAVE FOR GUYS THAT WANT TO SMELL GOOD FOR THE LADIES!.VERY DIFFERENT AND I WILL BE BUYING ANOTHER BOTTLE WHEN IT GET HALF WAY!</li>
    <li> EL PRODUCTO LLEGO BIEN SOLO QUE EN LA PAGINA DESIA  K. BENIA CON CON UN REGALO Y NO FUE ASI.</li>
    <li> Great product and speedy service!! My brother loved the scent and will continue to purchase it in the future!</li>
    <li> great deal great price</li>
    <li> Very good would recommend to other buyers</li>
    <li> Okay well i guess i&#x27;m showing a little bit more enthusiasm then i really should be, but&lt;br /&gt;what can i say? Although the title of the cologne \\&quot;Free Time\\&quot; is a bit childish and somewhat lame&lt;br /&gt;i can&#x27;t say the same for the Fragrance. Granted this is NOT a unique in terms of scent, come on its a&lt;br /&gt;citrus fresh scent which pretty much dominate in the world of fragrances, buuuuut regardless of it&#x27;s unoriginality&lt;br /&gt;this cologne is a definite must try for those who love Aquatic/citrus scents. its a GREAT alternative to the ever soooo popular and over use Acqua Di Gio, Issey Miyaki, 212, and cool waters to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;free time\\&quot; starts off with a blast of grapefruits and lemons, and stays that way for quite some time, and if your familiar with Ferragamo colognes you know that each one has that signature pepper scent. Although its not as pronounced as it is in Black and the original F, you still get a small hint towards the end or \\&quot;dry down\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Longevity is just average about 4 to 6 hours, projection could be better, but most aquatic scents dont tend to last anyways. So all in all pretty pleased with this Flanker, and best of all since most of Ferragamo Colognes are totally underrated and probably unheard of,  you won&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like everyone else.</li>
    <li> This Is my first time I bought fragrance with out test I  purchase because  good review. When package arrived I open and spray on it my boyfriend he just love it also, so u don&#x27;t have to spend lots of money on buy some where else.</li>
    <li> Ferragamo does it well and continue to do it with a new line. The smell is still true. Last long and smells great!</li>
    <li> I am exceedingly particular when it comes to selecting a men&#x27;s fragrance.  Most men&#x27;s fragrances are either too conspicuous and \\&quot;in-your-face\\&quot; strong or have peculiar notes that change based upon one&#x27;s individual body chemistry.  With this in mind, I sampled most of the popular fragrances available and selected Ferragamo F Free Time Eau De Toilette (EDT).  \\&quot;Free Time\\&quot;  has been recently discontinued by the manufacturer, however it may still be available from some third party vendors.  Its unique delicate citrus, marine and gentle floral notes remains distinctive in the huge fragrance arena and will set you apart from the rest of the pack.  My wife loves this fragrance-I would bathe in it if I could!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few suggestions to take into consideration before making your fragrance purchase:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Ferragamo remains an understated and underrated player in the US market.  Although sold in many upscale US department stores, its marketing and promotion remains tepid compared to many of its competitors with larger promotional and marketing budgets.  This means it may be more challenging to locate or obtain a free sample but it also means that it is likely to remain distinctive on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Research has shown that EDT&#x27;s that possess more delicate scents (i.e. \\&quot;notes\\&quot; in the lexicon of many manufacturers), tend to be both preferred and remembered compared with fragrances having stronger or more potent scents. In fact, this appears to be valid regardless of one&#x27;s body chemistry or gender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. This EDT appears to last from 4-6 hours before fade-out.  It will blend with your body chemistry and may slightly change the intensity of the notes.  Therefore, two people applying the exact same metered dose at the same time may smell noticeably different and distinct without compromising the integrity of the cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Shelf Life:  This is an area usually not mentioned or discussed.  Each box of genuine product should have a manufacturer lot code stamped in black on the bottom of each box (e.g. \\&quot;20C65AR1\\&quot;).  These date codes are usually proprietary and definitely NOT consumer-friendly.  However, most are Julian-based codes which identify the month, day and week or year of manufacture with a series of letters and/or numbers.  Most EDT&#x27;s should last 1-2 years from DOM (date of manufacture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Since this item has been discontinued, vendors will be quick to sell these units-oldest stock first!  Be careful and purchase ONLY from reputable vendors such as Amazon, particularly since you may be purchasing old (aging) product.  Be certain that you can return stale or unacceptable product without a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Avoid wearing a single EDT or fragrance daily on a consistent basis.  This is because, like many things used frequently and consistently, your body may \\&quot;adapt\\&quot; to the fragrance over time and you may find that you need to use more of the EDT to obtain the same level of effect.  The same is true of medications and supplements.  Try to vary your fragrances by having several different ones.  Remember that variety is the spice of life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Supplied in an attractive glass decanter but the shape of the bottle is not ergonomic making it extremely cumbersome and difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Before purchasing any fragrance, request samples at the major department stores in your area (Macy&#x27;s, Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, etc. are excellent choices).  If samples are not available, request a tester sample.&lt;br /&gt;NEVER purchase a fragrance sight untested or unsampled!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Request the contact email, address and phone number for the distributor.  They will often help you decipher their date code to insure that you are purchasing fresh product. Most senior sales associates at the stores should be able to obtain this information for you....ask for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Keep the product away from heat, sunlight, a windowand any extreme temperatures.  These variables will impede and compromise the integrity and effectiveness of all fragrances.  Store in a cool room at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. EDT&#x27;s are the second strongest fragrance trumped only by a full cologne (\\&quot;parfum\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;Check this link for a good primer and classification of fragrances. [...]&lt;br /&gt;This should also assist you in making the correct purchase for yourself or for your partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps and wishing you a sweet smelling year!and any extreme temperatures.

    <li> Bought this at duty shop free in Japan it was $60 a bottle for 1.7Fl and I can get half the price here in the US for a bigger size can&#x27;t go wrong with that.&lt;br /&gt;It smell really nice that why I bought it there. Since I&#x27;m not familiar with the brand thought I couldn&#x27;t get it over here in the US.&lt;br /&gt;But for some reason it only lasted couple hours but I still love it anyway. Great summer clean smell. Now I&#x27;m gonna try the black one.</li>
    <li> Awesome shipping time and just as described!</li>
    <li> THE SENT IS VERY PLESENT HOWEVER IT DOES NOT LAST LONG. I CHOOSE TO BUY ONLY THROUGH AMAZON BECAUSE I DONT WANT TO INCOUNTER ANY FAKE STUFF. OTHER THAN THAT I LOVE THE SMELL IT JUST DOES NOT LAST LONG.</li>
    <li> I am back..!!!  It has been a while since my last review - you guys know the deal - working long hours, a couple of business trips, and the yearly golf trip to Myrtle Beach.  I just wish my game were better..!! Keep it in the short grass, right..??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What better way to come back than with Free Time.. For those of you that like aqua and citrus fragrances, this one is for you.  What is the old saying - often imitated, but never duplicated..??  Yeah, I get it that there are a number of aqua/citrus fragrances out there - Free Time is easy on the nose and unique in it&#x27;s own way.  It comes out of the bottle with a blast of citrus/lemon, but the beauty is, it settles into a scent of aquatic and citrus that is pleasant without overwhelming.  The finishing notes of musk are subtle, but detectable...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed with the fragrance that I have placed it in my Top Ten.  Free Time offers above average projection and sillage. The longevity of the fragrance is also above average, lasting six (6) to eight (8) hours on the skin and even longer on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the \\&quot;Wow Factor\\&quot;, I have not received any compliments - but I have only worn it once (today).  It is a great scent and I am confident the compliments waiting to happen.  Sweetie likes it, but she prefers the more heavy leathery, spicy, or woodsy scents.  Given the type of fragrance, I would suggest that Free Time is a summer scent, but for any occasion.  (Personally, I I like the fragrance so much, I would or could wear it during any season or for any event).  For those who have not tried Ferragamo fragrances, go for it - perhaps a best kept secret.  The only ones I have tried that didn&#x27;t care for are the original (red box) cologne and the (white box) platinum edition - the others are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another beauty about Free Time is the price/value.  Currently selling for mid-$30s for a large bottle and dropping.  For that price, you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is first class and the bottle is nicely designed.  A bit cumbersome, but unique and easy on the eyes.  I am fond of those bottles with, at least, a portion clear to see the clarity of the fragrance - kinda like fine wine or a classy bourbon (I managed to use \\&quot;classy\\&quot; and \\&quot;bourbon\\&quot; in the same sentence - wow..!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final tally for Free Time is 4.5 stars out of 5 stars. I am a fan and I definitely recommend adding to your collection. The fragrance is fantastic and for the money - go for it..

    <li> It was exactly what I was expecting and came early than expected delivery date.</li>
    <li> Smells great. People even make compliments.&lt;br /&gt;It might sound crazy, but sometimes I wear it even at home for myself.</li>
    <li> Searched all over for this cologne since smelling it in Bloomingdales. It is great and a nice soft summer scent, not to loud and fruity.</li>
    <li> great price with fresh and aqua smell</li>
    <li> Same as in big box retailer</li>
    <li> the prfeume is ok but it doesnt last long for a day.after spraying it wait for an hour and u cannot smell the fragrance u just need to spray it again unlike other cologne that last for a day.</li>
    <li> Great Service and item</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Fresh and crisp, this a perfectly balanced cologne. Not to overwhelming at all. First purchased this in Florence when I was there last summer. Loved it so much that I had to get a new bottle. Reminds me of Florence every time I use it.</li>
    <li> This EDT smells quite nice out the box (FYI: purchased from AMZN and the item was wrapped so we assume it is authentic).&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit soft smelling (on me) and good for casual wear and summer evenings.&lt;br /&gt;My main reason for giving this EDT a 3 star and not a higher rating is lack of staying power.&lt;br /&gt;I find the fragrance fades considerably after about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;I will usually apply a bit heavier than other brands; you can slightly refresh by very lightly wetting if you put on near the inner elbow and forearm area.</li>
    <li> Liking the fragrance is a personal matter, but the current price at Amazon makes it bargain (in the $30s). The smell is not overwhelming and lasts for whole day. It&#x27;s a cool bottle, but a little cumbersome when spraying</li>
    <li> Very good smelling fragrance..really good price.</li>
    <li> Do not have the lingering aroma and has signs of being a counterfeit product.Most of the perfumes that I bought are very good quality and have never had any kind of complaints about that.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;d already bought F by Ferragamo and figured I&#x27;d try another one that got good ratings on here. I like it even more than the original- it&#x27;s not too light but not overpowering either, and it&#x27;s got lots of interesting notes that remind me of soft woods, dark florals, and (somehow) water. I&#x27;m not an expert at describing notes, but the blue packaging makes perfect sense for the cologne.</li>
    <li> Will buy another one and stock.. wears it every day</li>
    <li> Loved it! Authentic and smells great, amazing price too!</li>
    <li> This cologne has a leather, woodsy (cedar)  musk which works well for daytime wear (5-10 hours).  It&#x27;s not very overpowering so it&#x27;s crowd-safe, and a great go-to option for casual wear.  A local retailer claimed to be selling the original to justify a very high markup.  I tested it, and ordered the significantly cheaper version from Amazon.  As expected, the fragrance along with the duration were identical experiences.  So, thank you Amazon, for helping foil another money-grabbing ploy.</li>
