<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Within just a few days of using this product my friends were complimenting me on how great my skin looked. They said I was \\&quot;glowing\\&quot;. That&#x27;s huge because I didn&#x27;t mention that I was using a new product and I have never had good skin as I have had acne breakouts since my teens. I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a month and my skin looks better than ever. For the first time in ages, I feel comfortable going without makeup to even out my skin tone. I love the pleasant citrus scent and way the product is immediately absorbed into my skin.  I also feel that it tightens my skin making it look younger.  I&#x27;ve tried prescription Retin A and many high end cosmetic products and nothing has given me results like this. One of my friends just started using it and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I will use it again.</li>
    <li> This product has made a huge difference for me. I have somewhat dry skin that becomes red and painful in winter weather, and not only did using \\&quot;C for yourself\\&quot; normalize my skin tone after just a few days, it has actually made me look about five years younger. A little goes a long way too, the 1.7 oz pump lasts me a month.</li>
    <li> Somehow my very oily, acne prone skin has flip flopped from my teen years to late 20&#x27;s to being super sensitive and dry. This is a fantastic serum that is light enough to quickly absorb and can be used alone or under layers of other moisturizers. I have even noticed the tightening of my pores as advertised. :) I also have \\&quot;Oh What a Night\\&quot; and \\&quot;Have a Vine Day\\&quot; moisturizers that I use in conjunction when I need a bit more softness. I love, love, love \\&quot;Oh What a Night\\&quot; which is what turned me onto Nature&#x27;s Gate. I awake with the softest skin I have ever had and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. These products are worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever found.  It is light-weight but works all day.  It has never clogged my pores or felt greasy.  Plus it has Vitamin C which is great for the skin.  I&#x27;ve told all my friends about it.</li>
    <li> Stumble upon it through a free sample. Very pleasantly surprised and it takes a lot for me to say that. Visibly reduces spots and evens skin tone. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I usually have oily to normal skin, but in the winter (the season it is) my skin gets a little dry. This product hydrated my skin, and took about eighty percent of the redness away in only about a week, and using it once daily after exfoliating my face. This is my new favorite lotion.</li>
    <li> I really like this brand........Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics C for Yourself, (1.7 fl oz) (50 ml).....nice not to heavy or greasy absorbs well....Bought 3....nice product!</li>
    <li> Best non greasy effective facial softener, toner, and it seems to help with refining pores very quickly. I don&#x27;t need to use very   much at all, only a drop or two is needed.</li>
    <li> This review is primarily written as a response to a \\&quot;one star\\&quot; revewer which made me question her motivations. I&#x27;ve been using this product together with \\&quot;Have a Vine Day\\&quot;  moisterizer for years, since the time they were still selling it at our \\&quot;Whole Foods\\&quot; store. As all women, I assume, I tried many other products as well but Nature&#x27;s Gate \\&quot;C for yourself\\&quot; and \\&quot;Have a vine day\\&quot; have always been a \\&quot;guaranteed\\&quot; back up that worked. I was not that much into organics at the time but now I am. This product is really amazing.  It&#x27;s very light, very absorbent and you feel that your skin breathes well after the application. I have a very sensitive skin but with this product I don&#x27;t need to worry about anything. I know I am repeating myself but you need to follow it with their moisterizer for best results. For me this is the best product available on the market and I even stopped shopping around. Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I just got it as a gift for my wife. She is very happy with it, and it seems very good product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least five years now I just love it, when you put this on after washing your face it smooths your face out if you have big pours and makes your face feel so smooth.</li>
    <li> Works great with my sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t have any reaction and don&#x27;t break out. It makes my skin moist and soft. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and texture so far.  It&#x27;s just to new to judge how well it works. I use this prior to using my regular face lotion. My face is to dry to use alone.</li>
    <li> a little greasy ---felt like it clogged my pores</li>
    <li> Pure organic and everything good. Iightweight soaks in quickly, non greasy. Great for mature skin or&lt;br /&gt;skin that breaks out. I now use it with the Clarisonic Opal which causes the lotion to penetrate deeper.&lt;br /&gt;I always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> This serum is very good!  Easy to absorve,and it smells good! Very fresh and natural citrus scent. Also my pores has got smaller.  It works what they say.  I like Nature&#x27;s Gate.</li>
    <li> I originally picked this up at T.J. Maxx, and just bought more via Amazon. This is by far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s not thick or greasy, and I feel like I can really see a difference when I use it regularly. It&#x27;s been a month or so since I ran out and I&#x27;m eagerly looking forward to getting this in the mail.</li>
    <li> I love products that fall under the more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; side and also not tested on animals...I have tried several other face creams and by far Derma-E was the one brand doing me more good than any other, but then I came across this lovely face cream. It is absolutely amazing. I personally love it! It&#x27;s hard for me to be really happy with a cream because I want something to help with my many acne scars (hyper-pigmentation and ice pick scars). For the time i used this product I feel like it helped me somewhat. Plus it just gives the skin a certain vibrance! I have combination skin and it worked great both on oily and drier areas.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer if you&#x27;re looking for a cream that&#x27;s not so strong with vitamin C. I used it on my face and the backs of my hands for sun spots that are coming with age.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best product ever. Its smooth and youthful and you can&#x27;t go wrong on this purchase. If your hesiitant like I was to try something new don&#x27;t be!!! Irs a great product!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It smells good.  It&#x27;s light and does the trick.  It is also a lot less expensive than the one that my esthetician  sells in her shop.</li>
    <li> I love the whole line of Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics skin care. I was not familiar with facial serums before winning $100 worth of this skin care. I love the natural light fragrances! This serum works great as an addition to their moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Love the texture and scent. I would buy again!</li>
    <li> Feels so great on your skin. It really makes your skin look amazing.  I love this stuff! Really light and not greasy.</li>
    <li> I love the product , its organic and has vitamin c in it , smells great it a great product</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, as I&#x27;ve never used Vit. C lotion. It doesn&#x27;t have any burning effect, as I&#x27;d anticipated. It does smell really great!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and find it works as advertised and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I am so happy I found the right moisturizer for my face without the parabens that used to freak me out!! I walked into a Marshall&#x27;s store when I stumbled on this paraben-free serum and decided to give it a try. I also try to look out for products that contain vitamin c because of their clarifying effects. And since it was priced under $10 bucks, I decided to give it a try. About a month has passed and so far I feel my skin has gotten tighter, toned and brighter too!! oh!! and it does diminishes the size of your pores like it says it does, and it does not make me breakout!! I would pay double of what I paid @ Marshalls if I had to since they are so hard to find....I guess I got lucky the first time! :) I recomend this to anybody!!</li>
    <li> I love the results of using this product!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product, my daughters face does not breakout anymore after using this instead of a regular face cream. It keeps my face soft, smooth, with an even tone.</li>
    <li> The C for Yourself has proved a really nice serum for me. I&#x27;ve always had large pores with combination skin. While it&#x27;s not a &#x27;miracle in a bottle&#x27; I have noticed it&#x27;s tightened up my pores a bit and helped my dry areas. It has a light non-greasy application with a very soft scent of orange creamsicle. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over two weeks now and have noticed only positive changes to my skin. I will continue to purchase this for my skincare regimen and would recommend it for those with oily/combination skin.</li>
    <li> Fantastic cream with real results. Wife absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum because all the reviews at the time said it was very moisturizing. That was not the case for me. It completely dried out my skin and made it tight and uncomfortable all day. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I only gave it 4 stars because it is alittle drying.  Definitely need a good moisterizer on top.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes nicely. Leaves my skin with a silky patina. Is not heavy and has a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Clears my skin and keeps it fresh all day.</li>
    <li> Beware!  This is a classic case of greenwashing!  I thought this was a safe line of products, but their labelling is terribly deceptive.  If you go to the Skindeep cosmetics database, you&#x27;ll find that it is loaded with nasty chemicals that are not safe, with a few organic things thrown in.  For the skindeep review:  http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/brand/Nature%27s_Gate_Organics/.  I hope I can get my money back.</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome.  it smells wonderful and works great under makeup.  not greasy and makes skin super soft.  i highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I believe the product helped my skin look somewhat better. Not sure about \\&quot;dramatically refine skin tone and texture\\&quot;, but it goes on well, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Caused blemishes. The more I used it the worse my skin become. When I stop using it my skin came to its normal state.</li>
    <li> Nice, believe it evened out my skin tone, nice texture and fragrance.  Eight more words?? what  do you want me to say</li>
    <li> I like the product but the product comes out in a squirt that shoots at you or at the wall.  I have bought 2 separate bottles and they both do it.  I have to take lid off and get product out.  I recommend if you don&#x27;t mind wasting product with the squirts..or you don&#x27;t mind taking lid off to get product out.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It smells awesome, feels great going on, and absorbs quickly. Within a couple of days, my skin looked healthier and more even. This will definitely be a permanent fixture in my daily skin care regimen!</li>
    <li> This is a highly effective serum that smells great and does wonders for the skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Even if I don&#x27;t use it since a very long time, I can tell this serum is excellent for my skin. My skin is smoother and brighter. I use it under my day cream on a clean face and it goes right in, with a natural scent of oranges. Not greasy and pleasant to use. I give 4 star because the bottle is in glass and I don&#x27;t like to use it over a bathroom floor (ceramic).</li>
    <li> Love the feel and smell of this product. I think it has helped in fading my brown spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used C for Yourself on and off over the past year or so and I absolutely notice a difference in how (I hate to use this word because it sounds so cheesy, but it&#x27;s true) radiant my skin looks. There&#x27;s definitely a glowing quality that my skin has when I&#x27;m using it regularly and my skin looks and feels smoother. I think it&#x27;s a little light weight to use alone, so I use another heavier cream along with it at night, but even on days when I just use the C for Yourself, there&#x27;s a real difference in how bright my skin looks. Glad to have found something that works so reliably and well (and naturally!).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not easily sold on skin care products but this one I will order over &amp; over. My t-zone is oily &amp; most products don&#x27;t work well to control the shine &amp; pores.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this lotion at first, because the bottle was a little strange and it was a little runny for me.  However, this lotion is excellent on my face and I have weird skin (a mix of dry and oily).  It does not make my face feel greasy nor look greasy, and it feels so light and fresh.  I also love the scent.</li>
    <li> I am a vegan and have tried most of vegan products for years. I just bought this lotion after I read all reviews and I am so happy that I made a good choice! This lotion is truly moisturizing and smells very nice. My skin just absorbs the lotion right away and I definitely feel that this lotion helps reduce pores. Good food for your skin!</li>
    <li> The Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics C for Yourself is a good product, I have bought it again second time. It makes my skin firmer&lt;br /&gt;and covers the pours nicely.</li>
    <li> I am over 50 and I struggled with acne as a teen and as a young adult. After researching the affects Vitamin C has on our skin, I purchased Organics C for Yourself. I use it in conjunction with Oh What a Night cream by Nature&#x27;s Gate. I can tell a difference in the texture of my skin after 3 weeks of using these products. I also have a PMD that I use once every 7 days so I have my on skin spa treatment in the comfort of my home.</li>
    <li> This product has been pretty good on my skin. I think I see a difference in texture-- my face looks much smoother and tighter. I like that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get in on the whole face. It has a light orange smell and doesn&#x27;t go on greasy. Since it does contain citrus, it might be a little drying, sometimes I just put a little bit of my moisturizer over it and it&#x27;s fine. Awesome packaging too!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My skin looks and feels a decade younger than what I am and this product plays a big part.  I use to buy it at Meijer but they quit selling it so now I order it thru amazon.</li>
    <li> The lotion was fantastic but the bottle was hard to get everything out at the end and shoots far when using throughout.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in my skin at all. The scent is terrific though.  but as for moisture and wrinkles, nothing much changed. I didn&#x27;t really expect it to. Vitamin C as an anti-oxident works from the inside.</li>
    <li> I am over 65 will pretty good skin.  this has amazed me!!  my skin looks so good and mostly it is firm again.  not like a miracle but this product will really make a difference.  buy buy buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics C for Yourself lotion. It is very light and fast absorbing. It smells like oranges and not greasy. It does good job moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy smelling like a burst of orange and my skin is tighter!!! Everyday it&#x27;s a reminder for me to feed my skin with all natural skin care!! I&#x27;ll probably purchase the eye cream too! Thank you Nature&#x27;s gate!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer!  Reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I gave a 5 star because for me, it made my face softer ,therefore, wrinkles looked less noticeable  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would buy this product again and recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Very nice cream, makes by face feel very soft. I would buy this product again and will tell my friends</li>
    <li> Besides doing nice things for my skin I am very happy with the very light lemony scent. I am quite sensitive to odors and most perfumes cause breathing problems for me but the scent of this lotion is so light and pleasant it does not cause any problems.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they made a cologne with that scent.</li>
    <li> Organics C improved texture of my skin.  The application produced just the right amount without  waste.  I intend to repeat my orderd.</li>
    <li> This product is really great (as are all the Nature&#x27;s Gate skincare products I have tried so far). After cleansing and toning my face, I put this on twice daily as an extra layer before moisturizer, in order to banish any dry patches. I have acne-prone and sometimes shiny skin, and I always worry that adding another product will make these things worse. However, after 3 months, this serum has only made my skin softer and smoother. An added bonus is that my pores also look much smaller. I recommend sticking with it for a few weeks, because I didn&#x27;t see these results immediately. The serum smells like oranges too, which I really enjoy!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t really see any difference.  I love Nature&#x27;s Gate&#x27;s Forget Your Lines product, though.  Definite results there, no question about it.</li>
    <li> Saw a difference on day one...only loving it more every day.  Definitely improves skin tone, smooths, and minimizes pores.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product and will purchase it again.  I use in conjunction with hyaluronic acid.  Between the two, my skin feels great!</li>
    <li> I really liked this!  I will most likely use it on my neck and decollete area, as it is light and goes on easily.  I like to moisturize with something light, as I don&#x27;t like anything heavy or sticky on my neck.  Some serums can be very expensive and I felt this was very well priced.  Added bonus is that it is very healty for your skin, no parabens, SLS, etc.  I also loved the bottle and the pump.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually not easily impressed with cosmetic products - as they never deliver what they promise and there is no magic lotion out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this one feels very good. You feel the tightening effect right away and it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s drying (so it&#x27;s not like applying mud on your face). I always follow with my regular lotion after this. It dries very fast and I think it work up to a point. nothing magical, but I think it does add some glow to your face.</li>
    <li> IT IS GREAT. I USE IT FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. IT IS THE BEST FACE SERUM ON THE MARKET. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
