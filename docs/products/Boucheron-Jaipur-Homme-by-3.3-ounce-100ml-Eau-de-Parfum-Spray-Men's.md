<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Got this for my partner, smells great and the price was better then store.  I like to wear it too.</li>
    <li> Brought back a lot of memories.</li>
    <li> Great service great product very pleased</li>
    <li> I stopped in to a perfume counter and asked a very lovely lady what perfume she would recommend. with a thick sensual accent  she reached for this stuff  and said in  a husky voice. this is earthy, sensual. tis is a mannnns cologne.  I bought the entire gift kit and she was absolutely right. the dry down in lovely like a light kiss. after putting in on give it a bit to evaporate but you WILL get compliments when you wear this cologne.  I buy the perfume in stead of the toilet because it&#x27;s stinger.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this colgne for about 10 years. It has a pleasant scent, the women I work and play with love it, and it was less expensive here on Amazon then if I bought it at a department store</li>
    <li> I buy this for my husband because I love the scent.</li>
    <li> Great scent that last all day.</li>
    <li> Such a sexy fragrance.  Highly recommended,</li>
    <li> This may have been the same product as the one I have ordered in the past, but I&#x27;m not sure. Different printing on bottle made me wonder if it was actually the same product. Seemed close to the same scent but again, I&#x27;m not sure.  Some times companies try to make changes to what is already a familiar recognized product, and end up confusing the CUSTOMER. The scent smelled close to the same, but seemed slightly different. For that I give It: (****). Thank you, Kent</li>
    <li> Good smell,,not too strong but wife seems to like it,,and expect other ladies will too,,</li>
    <li> the price was excellent. the purchase was easy and came to Puerto Rico rapidly. In PR this product dont exist.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this great and  unique eau de parfum more than 10 years ago. My wife loves it. Distinct and subtle.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as described with good bubble wrap.</li>
    <li> I really like the odor of this perfume, it lasts longer and all my friends like it. It is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colognes, and I can&#x27;t believe I got the Eau de Parfum at such a great price.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Perfume is very very good. smell lasts for few days/weeks. Nice perfume but cheap bottle cap. I received with the broken top.</li>
    <li> Very good one. I gave gave to my uncle and he loved it. Strong smell, but so good. I like it.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased as a gift for myself. I love this suff!! The price online was 50% less than at a major Dept Store. I ordered on Cyber Monday &amp; the product arrived on time for Christmas. It is more concentrated &amp; the aroma last most of the day. It has a nice sent and it is not too strong.This is my favorite!! The Eau De Parfum spray last longer than the Toiette Spray.</li>
    <li> Good Product&lt;br /&gt;Great Seller</li>
    <li> This is my favorit calogne.  I have several bottles of it and when it is on sale I stock up.</li>
    <li> Best cologne I have ever owned since this date. Its EDP and stays on for days. I would Recommend to others.</li>
    <li> this perfumes is one my husbands favorite perfumes, and i can always find it here at a great price. :)</li>
    <li> This perfume is part of my collection from while. Good lingering smell .you can feel it even after hours. Little strong  but smell so good I keep buying it and it last longer than my other perfume.</li>
    <li> good thing, depends on smell. for me it is good. very sensetive smell. big bottle. for the parfumes, it smells fine</li>
    <li> Perfect at 1/2 the price of Macys</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s all my wife will use.</li>
    <li> If order a product today when it hits me exactly?</li>
    <li> Outstanding fragrance! Jaipur is a totally unique fragrance that is a true oriental spicy masterpiece. You get cinammon and vanilla and wood mixed with flowers. It really is a beautiful scent. I warn people to go light on the trigger especially if you have sensitive skin. I own many different colognes and jaipur is the only one that ocassionally causes my skin to break out in a rash. Because of this I don&#x27;t wear it every day. I love the smell so much that I wear Jaipur anyway and just spray a little which I&#x27; ve found is ENOUGH and still works great. Jaipur is sophisticated, alluring, elegant, and versatile. You wear a suit and spray this on and women will notice. You wear this with jeans and a t-shirt and you&#x27;ll smell like a freshly baked cinammon bun cooked in a wood stove in a log cabin filled with flowers. Bravo to Boucheron. I hope they never discontinue this fragrance. 5 stars</li>
    <li> This parfum is for my husband he likes it so much.  He has using all the different boucheron since about 10 years or more and love it.</li>
    <li> I got onto Jaipur Homme after hearing a female co-worker return from a trip to the mall raving about how wonderful this stuff smelled. I have gotten many compliments on it over the years. It was delivered on time and as advertised.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to find this cologne on Amazon for my husband. This cologne has a wonderful scent. I bought two bottles and hope they continue to carry it. He has received so many comments about how good the cologne smells. I find so many of the newer colognes very LOUD. This has such a pleasing scent.</li>
    <li> It does not last just 2,3 hours</li>
    <li> arrived in a timely fashion and in proper condition. masculine scent, yet not too musky. the scent is fantastic, my lady loves it! i recommend this one</li>
    <li> Jaipur is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne. He tried many others before I introduced him to this masculine scent. Now it&#x27;s his  present from me on any occasion he runs out.  He says it&#x27;s all the more special because I was thinking about him and bought it for him to try originally. Amazon is one of the few places we can locate it and the price is always right. Now Jaipur has become his cologne soulmate!</li>
    <li> Much sweeter smell than the musky of the &amp;#34;Boucheron&amp;#34; not Jaipur. But is a good pleasant smell. I wanted a day parfum, but this is to me, straight up night time cologne.</li>
    <li> was worried that this would be a knockoff or smell like alcohol but thankfully it smelled as it should, my dad was satisfied and i&#x27;ll consider buying again from this seller</li>
    <li> I think the Jaipur Homme  By Boucheron Eau de parfum was old may be not original.  I&#x27;m unsatisfied with the product I have been using the Boucheron since 1996 but this time I&#x27;m very disapointed ............</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume for almost 15 years. Had always paid $100 to as much as $130 for the very same thing from the upscale department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this from Amazon for now on as well as turning my wife on to here special fragrances.</li>
    <li> My manager asked me to buy this item for him and he told me is a good product, but when i made the order and received the item i took it for me, lol.</li>
    <li> There are limited choices for men when it comes to EDPs (there are tons of EDTs). I find Boucheron and Givenchy as some of the best. Jaipur is a day long perfume which lingers on even after you have a shower after work. I hope they maintain the consistency and quality. 15-20years ago YSL Kouros was available as Parfum concentrate. It no longer is available. so go for it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, half the price on line. My husband has used this for years. Won&#x27;t regret the purchase. Amazing smell. Sincerely Donna Manuel</li>
    <li> Best is best,,,,,!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Kind of a womenly spicy smell. Definitely is an acquired taste. But lasts all day so it feels like you just sprayed it.</li>
    <li> Perfect and quick delivery</li>
    <li> hard to find but good buy</li>
    <li> He is all man and the Jaipur just accents who he is. I love the way it smells on him. It&#x27;s even good on my pillow when he&#x27;s not here!</li>
    <li> Strong and long-standing perfume.</li>
    <li> Best cologne I have ever used,great praise and great product. I&#x27;ve Armani and  Versace cologne that i use, but this one is better and is real Parfum because i did compare Boucheron from Amazon that i ordered week ago and one that i have in house and is almost out, both are the same real parfum.</li>
    <li> Product is great! It took a long time to receive, even with two day shipping.</li>
    <li> The package did not have a plastic seal around and the bottle was places in a ziploc bag.</li>
    <li> One of my best smelling fragrance!</li>
    <li> This item smell like aftershave. for better results, spray on for about 15 before you interact with people. otherwise, someone might just puke on you</li>
    <li> I sent this product to my brother and he loves it. This is not his first time using boucheron jaipur. I&#x27;m always buying my brother his colognes and he likes for me to buy his colognes. He knows that when I send him any colognes that it&#x27;s going to be very elegant and one of the top of the line products.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and my DW thinks it is just right for my skin chemistry. Very fast delivery and the right stuff!</li>
    <li> It\\&quot;s a good cologne. Stay for a long time. Although, it is very very strong.   I bought directly from Amazon. Buying perfume online  is a nightmare sometimes. I am happy I got the real Jaipur by Boucheron. Received on time.  .</li>
    <li> Stayed very long three nights on my clothes</li>
    <li> DAY OR NIGHT, PERFECT COLOGNE.  CLASSY.  I NEVER TIRE OF IT.  WOMEN LOVE IT.  I ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS FROM THEM.</li>
    <li> This is the best cologne I have ever used.  It&#x27;s out-of-the-ordinary and not like many European scents.  Thanks ladies for all your compliments.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and love the wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> Smells really awesome best thing about this cologne is it last longer then any other cologne I owned</li>
    <li> It is a Christmas gift for some else.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for men! I recommend it without any reservation.</li>
    <li> I had not smelled this fragrance before but was highly impressed upon receiving it through Amazon.com. If you love to smell good, this is it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s either old or it&#x27;s not real the smell from the cologne is gone within 15- 20 minutes. Very different in comparison to what I buy at the stores. this was the first time I ever bought online I won&#x27;t do it again I would advise anyone who even considers this not to do so.</li>
    <li> perfect! My husband&#x27;s favorite. Delivery and product arrived as planned.</li>
    <li> I had second thoughts about this cologne but it&#x27;s one of the best! came within 3 days and it smells really good, all the girls love it and that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
    <li> Wonderful manly scent. Given as gift.</li>
    <li> This is the I wanted, ordered and received.</li>
    <li> Its my honey&#x27;s favorite! Great price and its real not one of those fake or knock off colognes sold on some other websites. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> It was very good I have been looking for that for the longest</li>
    <li> Had a tome looking for this product until I met your site.  My Husband loves it.  The price of this product is much lower than purchasing in the store.  Shipped in a timely manner.  Love it!</li>
    <li> It smells like Pine to me or Juniper.  This is a woodsy, spicy fragrance that smells high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells what the woods smell like, pine needles, as I said above, Juniper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not sweet or floral at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Masculine&amp;#34; fragrance, whatever that means.  Not &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; or sweet at all.</li>
    <li> good ,very good-looking</li>
