      <li>Great product, keeps your hair nourished, shiny and healthy , I highly recommend it, you need to buy this shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have used this for over 3 years and buying them in this big size with free shipping is the best deal I can find.</li>
      <li>I love love love this brand and am happy to be a return customer and purchase a second set.</li>
      <li>Soft, manageable, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>Also true!</li>
      <li>and it has been a very good product on my long hair.</li>
      <li>The conditioner was fine...</li>
      <li>This product is watered down for sure!!!</li>
      <li>I can 100% guarantee that if you purchased this from a salon or authorized retailer your hair would look and feel fabulous.  </li>
      <li>it puts a great big smile on her face!</li>
      <li>If you want the real deal, don&#x27;t order this!!!</li>
      <li>The conditioner does not provide a provide a rich lather.</li>
      <li>and I still don&#x27;t feel as though my hoe is clean.</li>
      <li>shipped as expected great product.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this same product from a salon before and LOVED it.  </li>
      <li>What the others say about it being runny is true.</li>
      <li>My own experience with the product is highly favorable; but blindly publishing reviews without some inquiry is, at best, ubhelpful to your customers.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit light weight but works very well.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s economical.</li>
      <li>I love how soft and silky it leaves my hair</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo is so soft and leaves my hair so soft and smooth, and its not oily at all even after.</li>
      <li>She loves it and evidently always will.</li>
      <li>My hair stylist uses It&#x27;s a Ten on my hair all the time, and I love it, so I ordered this combo package.</li>
      <li>Actually, I question if it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
      <li>but I am not paying at hat much for just a conditioner!</li>
      <li>Should have read the reviews first.</li>
      <li>After using the entire line for about 2 weeks, my hair is in much better condition than before.</li>
      <li>Instead, used this Shampoo Combo and within a week my hair actually felt 100% better.  </li>
      <li>The same shampoo as in salons, but at a much more reasonable price.</li>
      <li>This is a good product, I have used it in the past.</li>
      <li>Also someone said their hair is more dry after using it.</li>
      <li>large sizes make it easy to keep in shower and save on smaller bottle prices.  </li>
      <li>the shampoo from Amazon is very watered down compared to my roommates.it&#x27;s nice</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a Ten shampoo and conditioner which worked just fine on my hair.</li>
      <li>I ordered this as a gift for my daughter in law and the product is very watery.  </li>
      <li>Very dissapointed with this &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; that was shipped to me.</li>
      <li>The shipper or packaging department should make sure that the bottles are securely closed before shipping.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather, it&#x27;s no creamy like the real thing</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic bargain and definitely makes the difference in the world when you haven&#x27;t used a salon quality product for a week or so.</li>
      <li>By the time all of this transpired, it was too late for me to return the products, so I am out  a good bit of money.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down and has a fresh light scent.</li>
      <li>I am sure they watered it down.</li>
      <li>Finally found one that is accentually good for the hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down in the process!</li>
      <li>the shampoo is not nearly as thick as what I have found in the 10 oz.</li>
      <li>This is exactly the same as the one you can buy at the salon and is much cheaper.  </li>
      <li>The conditiner seems normal, nice and thick.</li>
      <li>It is a brand new bottle</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My hair stylist uses It&#x27;s a Ten on my hair all the time, and I love it, so I ordered this combo package. I was not pleased with it, so, assuming the product was &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;, I ordered another type of It&#x27;s a Ten shampoo and conditioner which worked just fine on my hair. To avoid having to return these larger, opened bottles, I gave them to my stylist to use. He, too, was not pleased with the products. He took them to a beauty product supplier who examined both the shampoo and conditioner and determined that both were either watered down or were not the actual product as represented. By the time all of this transpired, it was too late for me to return the products, so I am out  a good bit of money. I am not at all able to use this product on my hair type. Amazon should reconsider using this supplier. If you want the real deal, don&#x27;t order this!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for my daughter in law and the product is very watery.  She also mentioned that it has caused her scalp to break out.  She has had this product before and knows that this is not how the consistency should be.  This appears to be a problem with the seller&#x27;s version of it as I now see other reviews with the same issue.</li>
    <li> My X hairdresser ruined my hair, She used a 40 volume bleach on my prior bleached hair.  I honestly thought I would have to have a bob.  Instead, used this Shampoo Combo and within a week my hair actually felt 100% better.  Damage is done but at least I can continue to use this product and know I can keep my long hair. I have never used a better product.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, I have used it in the past. However the shipment I received the shampoo bottle leaked. Good thing it was expedited shipment or I would have lost more shampoo. The shipper or packaging department should make sure that the bottles are securely closed before shipping.</li>
    <li> The same shampoo as in salons, but at a much more reasonable price. This product was not watered down either. If you like this product I would recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> Love this!  The best ever!</li>
    <li> Shampoo is watery and is not up to par with the rest of the It&#x27;s a 10 product line. The conditioner does not provide a provide a rich lather. Do not recommend this product at all. Actually, I question if it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
    <li> I love It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Shampoo and Condition.  I color my hair red w/ highlights every 5 weeks and the color holds really well and my hair always looks healthy.</li>
    <li> unhappy with the shampoo it is very watery just as all the other reviews had said</li>
    <li> I took a gamble on this product based on other reviews and lost. The shampoo has obviously been watered down. It&#x27;s disappointing that there&#x27;s not more regulation of this, but I take responsibility for the purchase. I do not recommend this item and suggest finding a more reputable seller.</li>
    <li> Big let down. Wish I would have paid any attention to the reviews. It doesn&#x27;t lather, it&#x27;s no creamy like the real thing, it&#x27;s useless sadly. I actually combined it with another shampoo because I refuse to throw it away after paying for it.</li>
    <li> I currently use WEN and love it but wanted another option - everyone loves this stuff - I tried it and my hair felt dried out and if I didn&#x27;t use the leave in treatment I was not able to comb my hair.  Once I dry my hair after using this product, it is all frizz.</li>
    <li> Shampoo super watered down! It pours out of the bottle like water...not exaggerating!  The conditioner is perfect.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner-it&#x27;s amazing!!  Makes your hair feel so soft and manageable .</li>
    <li> Terrible. Don&#x27;t buy.  Not even the correct watered down product.  Very dissapointed with this &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; that was shipped to me. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY on this PHONY product.  Just spend the money for the ACTUAL product.</li>
    <li> Little disappointed cause the conditioner has a horrible bad odor and i have used this stuff before but I spent the money on it so I have to figure out how to deal with it. Everything else is good  with this.</li>
    <li> My wife has curly hair that she has a hard time taming so we purchased these products with skepticism. She loves them!! Her hair is softer and more manageable than ever! Rock on its a 10!</li>
    <li> shipped as expected great product. I have used this for over 3 years and buying them in this big size with free shipping is the best deal I can find.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t suds enough. I regularly bleach my roots and fry the ends. It&#x27;s a 10 products are the only products that can save it. Plus they are real thick and can last longer by adding water. I also use the leave-in spray conditioner.</li>
    <li> I already used its a 10 Miracle&#x27;s products before and I liked them. However, I decided to purchase this one in order to save money because it was bigger and cheaper. That was a very dumb decision. The quality of the shampoo is very very bad, it seems to me that it is mixed with water because I had used the same shampoo from other sellers and it is not like that. My advice, do not buy it. Also, I have been using the product for a month now and my hair is dryer.</li>
    <li> Have not had a bad hair day since I started to use this product line. The regular shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner and spray are my staples. These products are not cheap but they are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> No sulfates and great on colored hair. Helps restructure dry hair to give it bounce. A little goes a long way so it&#x27;s economical.</li>
    <li> My roommate has this shampoo and I used hers before I actually bought it and I really l loved it, but she got hers from.cosmoprof.. the shampoo from Amazon is very watered down compared to my roommates.it&#x27;s nice but I feel like I have to use more than I did using hers.I&#x27;d try to find it from somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Love all the Its a !0 products</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and I share these and it can last us well over a month with daily showering. We used to buy the smaller amounts from salons but it was getting too costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the product itself does some wonderful things for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy and probably the last person on the planet to care about stuff like this, but now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a while I wouldn&#x27;t go to any other brand because Its A 10 doesn&#x27;t put useless chemicals in their stuff and my fro is off the chain!</li>
    <li> great price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love Its a 10 and usually buy it at the hair salon. But it is getting so expensive. This is exactly the same as the one you can buy at the salon and is much cheaper.  I love how soft and silky it leaves my hair and I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set from beauty in style.  Ugh the shampoo is awful!  It&#x27;s watered down! I love It&#x27;s a 10 products and this is not a product from them! It doesn&#x27;t lather and you have to use tons of shampoo and I still don&#x27;t feel as though my hoe is clean. Yes, the conditioner is great but I am not paying at hat much for just a conditioner!</li>
    <li> The shampoo is very watered down; I thought I was crazy at first until I read all of the comments. It seems to me that the seller is the problem here, not the \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; line. I have always bought from salons but wanted a bigger bottle to last longer, big mistake! Don&#x27;t waste your money here</li>
    <li> What the others say about it being runny is true. Also someone said their hair is more dry after using it. Also true! I can 100% guarantee that if you purchased this from a salon or authorized retailer your hair would look and feel fabulous.  But this product is no good. I don&#x27;t know whats going on here but its definitely not up to par with it&#x27;s a 10 products.</li>
    <li> My hair was breaking and appearing limp and my hairdresser suggested this line.  I&#x27;ve been using now for 4 months and what an improvement.  I have people coming up to me and saying &amp;#34;What did you do with your hair, it looks great&amp;#34;.  Will continue to purchase product!</li>
    <li> great products. hair feels and looks great!</li>
    <li> I never tried this product before now, I Love the way my hair feels. Soft, manageable, it&#x27;s great. I would recommend it to anyone, the shampoo and conditioner work great together.</li>
    <li> Love &amp;#34;it&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; products!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a 10 is soooo expensive at the beauty store. This is a fantastic bargain and definitely makes the difference in the world when you haven&#x27;t used a salon quality product for a week or so. It doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down and has a fresh light scent.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this shampoo! Finally found one that is accentually good for the hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down in the process! Will buy buy buy for years to come!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Its a 10 prouducts, I have been using them for years! I order the 33.8oz combo set, thinking I was geting a good deal. I got the shippment when they said I would, which is a plus. HOWEVER the shampoo seems to be watered down. Its hits the shower floor befor I get it to my head. I have used this shampoo may times before and it has never been like this. The conditiner seems normal, nice and thick. I sent the company a message, telling them how the shampoo was watered down. This is the response I got from them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Sorry you didn&#x27;t like the brand you chose we buy it right from the company direct ... and never had bad feedback ..were just the middle guy so not sure why u would out a negative rating \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really YOU cant spell out the word YOU! Im very disappointed and will never order from this company again.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this by my colorist. They sell it in my upscale salon although, my colorist told me to order from amazon at a better price. Which it was however, I am just not happy with this shampoo &amp; conditioner in general. Left my hair feeling dry. Great scent but I ended up giving it away.</li>
    <li> I bought the entire line of shampoo, conditioner, spray in conditioner and conditioning mask because my hair is/was in terrible condition. Spoke with my hairdresser about it and she recommended this.  I am SO glad I took her advice.  After using the entire line for about 2 weeks, my hair is in much better condition than before. It was lacking moisture big time and this has helped put that moisture back in.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone who has damaged hair from heat like I do.</li>
    <li> This is the only Shampoo I use.  Even when I go on vacation I don&#x27;t take the samples from the hotel home because I&#x27;ll never use them.  This is all I need.</li>
    <li> I use It&#x27;s a 10 shampoo and conditioner all the time. However, when I received this combo package, the shampoo was  VERY watered down and smelled like rotten milk!!  Disgusting. It was definitely not the &amp;#34;Its a 10&amp;#34; product that I usually get when I buy from a reputable store.  The conditioner seemed normal but the pump was broken.  BEWARE, BEWARE, BEWARE. Should have read the reviews first.</li>
    <li> This product is to heavy for my hair. It makes it feel sticky. I quit using conditioner to see if that would help. Will keep using leave in conditioner it is awesome.</li>
    <li> I have used the it&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner for a while. Don&#x27;t know why I did not consider using their other products before now but I am glad I did. Plus I really think the price is wonderful compared to what you pay in the hair salons or the stores.</li>
    <li> love this product,  one of the best i have used in ages.  large sizes make it easy to keep in shower and save on smaller bottle prices.  love all the 10 products!</li>
    <li> Great product, keeps your hair nourished, shiny and healthy , I highly recommend it, you need to buy this shampoo &amp; conditioner. Fast Delivery, Great product, would buy from you again, A++++++++++</li>
    <li> this had great reviews so I tried it, but I just didn&#x27;t get it. Overpriced for the results I saw.</li>
    <li> very happy to report that the product arrived quickly and without issue.  I love love love this brand and am happy to be a return customer and purchase a second set.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo is so soft and leaves my hair so soft and smooth, and its not oily at all even after. its a great price!</li>
    <li> I just LOVE it&#x27;s a ten and it has been a very good product on my long hair. It&#x27;s a bit light weight but works very well.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my hair</li>
    <li> She loves it and evidently always will. Every time I order it for her it puts a great big smile on her face!</li>
    <li> I have been using It&#x27;s a 10 products for several years. The shampoo I received in this combo pack does NOT compare. It is SO watered down that it does not even lather. Typically with a It&#x27;s a 10 shampoo, all it takes is one pump to lather up my hair (and my hair is to my mid back). With the shampoo I received, it did not even compare after 5-10 pumps. It is a brand new bottle and I feel like I will be throwing it in the garbage because it obviously isn&#x27;t the same quality. I don&#x27;t know if this is the fault of the seller or the manufacturer, but it does seem like there are other complaints. Extremely disappointed as the purchase price is not cheap. I ordered from BeautyAnd. I could not leave feedback for the seller because I had already passed the deadline.</li>
    <li> My wife truly believes this makes her hair grow thicker and fuller.  It&#x27;s expensive, but if it works or at least makes her think it works, it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
    <li> Like others have posted. The conditioner was watery. I have used this product for years and never had this issue. If you shake the bottle it sounds like it has water in it. So, I was telling my hair dresser about it and she has one in stock. She shook it, you couldn&#x27;t hear anything! This product is watered down for sure!!! The conditioner was fine... The shampoo was the problem .</li>
    <li> i love the feeling this leaves my hair. It makes it nice and healthy looking. i would buy it again even tho its expensive.</li>
    <li> This is the salon price, but you get 2x the product! Great deal!! I will not buy from my salon any more - - - Thank you Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Great buy.  We all use this and love the product.  The combo makes it easy to buy and great price.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this same product from a salon before and LOVED it.  The conditioner is as expected, but the shampoo is runny and not the same consistency as the product I purchased in the salon.</li>
    <li> The product is sooooo watered down! The reviewer who said it hits the floor in the shower because it&#x27;s so thin and runny. I am sure they watered it down. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Why does Amazon not look at the incredible discrepency in these reviews (It&#x27;s A 10 shampoo is either a 5 or a 1) and contact the manufacturer or distributor of this item?  If there is a problem with the quality of the product (many people complain about &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34;, non-standard shampoo), then is it not appropriate for Amazon to ask questions of this manufacturer?  My own experience with the product is highly favorable; but blindly publishing reviews without some inquiry is, at best, ubhelpful to your customers.</li>
    <li> My daughter swears by the product.</li>
    <li> Have to agree with others....the shampoo is not nearly as thick as what I have found in the 10 oz. bottle.  Overall, results seem the same, but I feel that I am losing some of the shampoo because it&#x27;s too &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34;.</li>
