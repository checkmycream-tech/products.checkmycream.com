    <li> The product was exactly what my son wanted and needed.</li>
    <li> Everything was as it said it was. Ink sticks great</li>
    <li> Based on the ink alone. Very pigmented. Never had to go over a line more than one.&lt;br /&gt;I even got my sleeve tattooed with this. It&#x27;s been so amazing.  I usually reject ink so much but this one is dark as day. Even the white shows clear as day. I love the pigmentation of the ink; no need to redo lines over and over. But I still prefer intenze as a better outliner. But this does the job amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;As for shipping.  Came lame. Very annoying and even a few days after the expected shipping date. If it wasn&#x27;t for how good the ink is for the price, I&#x27;d get intenze in the tattoo shop in town. But I guess it&#x27;s worth it. Will buy more soon.</li>
