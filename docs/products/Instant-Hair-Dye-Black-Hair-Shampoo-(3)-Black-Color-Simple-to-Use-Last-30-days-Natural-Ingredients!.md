      <li>OMG it turns my gray hair into a dark black nice looking hair.</li>
      <li>The packets are pretty big and pretty full, so it seems like there will be enough to cover all of my hair (I have long hair- past my shoulders)</li>

      <li>I was excited to get this Black Hair Shampoo in to try out since they are only temporary and last 30days.</li>
      <li>Great stuff, I was a little skeptical about getting it.</li>

      <li>Black doesn&#x27;t really suit my skin tone.</li>
      <li>They left on the shampoo for 25 minutes, considering that the ingredients claim to be natural and harmless, leaving it on this long shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
      <li>I normally have to color my hair at least once a month, however this paper color last much longer.</li>

    <li> Turn my gray hair just a little brown, no black as supposed</li>
    <li> Who knew you could dye your hair quickly in the shower? That&#x27;s a great concept! For the price, these are very affordable (usually when my dad dyes his hair at the salon it&#x27;s a whopping 50 bucks). With three packets of these, that&#x27;s a deal! These worked for both my mom and my dad! They both have grey hair, and one packet (they each used half of the one packet) dyed their hair with ease.  My parents both just used this as if it were shampoo, they did say it can be quite messy at first but the dye is easy to clean off the bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;My parents both said that they recommend to use different gloves, the ones provided were useless. Using these with different gloves made shampooing these things easier. The color gave them a natural hair color feel, it wasn&#x27;t pitch black. They left on the shampoo for 25 minutes, considering that the ingredients claim to be natural and harmless, leaving it on this long shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. *I bought this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE AS OF 10/20/2015: Parents ordered two more of these as they are on sale for $9.95. It&#x27;s basically how they dye their hair now lol.</li>
    <li> I loved this, i loved getting to see what I would look like with black hair without having to keep it. I like buying it from Sure Luxury because I get 3 packs for a good price.</li>
    <li> This would be great to use if you have always wanted to have black hair but don&#x27;t want to commit.  It is temporary and lasts about 30 days.  This would come in handy if you have grey hair you want to cover !!  There are gloves in each packet to use so you don&#x27;t get it on your hands.  Comes in a 3 pack so it will last for several months.  Easy and quick to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this product complimentary (or at a discount) in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review.  These are just my own opinions and based on my personal experience.</li>
    <li> This is awesome and so easy to use. I just dampened my hair in the sink let it set for 5 minutes than hopped in the shower to wash it off. It is easy to apply and even with my long hair there was plenty of shampoo to go around. it suds up well and easy to put in. I have a lot of greys because of stress and this covers it perfectly. I already have black hair so this works perfectly to cover them up. It looks great and I love that it comes with 3 packs so it will last a few months for me. I received this for product testing purposes</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! OMG it turns my gray hair into a dark black nice looking hair. Awesome, no need to buy those expensive hair colors. It is easy to apply, you take a bath and use this shampoo and it&#x27;s magic. Now, I look young as 20. Great Product</li>
    <li> This stuff is soooo good...covers stubborn grey and helps close the cuticle. Makes hair smooth..I love it</li>
    <li> So easy to use and lasts all month. I have long hair and only used 1 packet. Absolutely recommend! I didn&#x27;t leave on my hair a long time like regular hair dye.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to try it out and I thought it was going to be a joke, but it really worked. It&#x27;s  amazing how quickly it worked too!</li>
    <li> DISCLAIMER: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review. These thoughts are my own and are not in any way influenced by the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received the hair dye shampoos today and have not used them yet. I will post an update once I do! The packets are pretty big and pretty full, so it seems like there will be enough to cover all of my hair (I have long hair- past my shoulders) Each packet also comes with a pair of plastic gloves, which I love because I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hands getting dyed black! I&#x27;m about to go test it out right now so look for an update soon!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I love the concept of this stuff! If it comes in different colors, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more! Black doesn&#x27;t really suit my skin tone. At first, It didn&#x27;t really seem like it dyed my hair, but then it definitely was noticeable! The picture definitely looks black, but in person It doesn&#x27;t look black. I think that&#x27;s because my hair is pretty long hair (as I stated above) so I probably needed more than 1 packet. Overall I&#x27;m amazed with how well it worked and how simple it was to do!! The first photo was before, and the second was after! (Sorry the second one is sideways, I can&#x27;t get it to rotate for some reason! :\)</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this Black Hair Shampoo in to try out since they are only temporary and last 30days.I thought it was a great way for people to try out hair color without it being permanent.They come in a 3 pack each has a pair of gloves for application and has 25ml per pack.The directions are very simple to follow and application is easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application:&lt;br /&gt;1 - wet hair thoroughly and towel dry a little bit&lt;br /&gt;2 - apply gloves and apply the whole packet to hair&lt;br /&gt;3 - massage well for 5 minutes until the shampoo is evenly out on your scalp&lt;br /&gt;4 - Rince well with water and voila your done it lasts up to 4weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Sodium alcohol ether sulphate,ethylene glycol distearate,para-phenylene diamine,essence,pure water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I ended up using this on my Husband since he wanted to use it.It came out better than expected and definitely covered up the here and there gray hairs I spotted on his head that he still denies he has haha.It worked perfectly for him his hair is aoubt 1 inchi thick right now so it was able to cover the whole thing very well.He actually likes it and I still have 2 more packets from him.We are excited to see how long it will last.This would make a great test run if you are deciding to dye your hair a certain color but do not want the permanent results.It is also a lot more safer if you are trying to repair your hair in my opinion.Less processing of your hair and more repairing will take place so this would be a great alternative to the salon.I like that it was a quick and painless process since I did have my little one running around at the time of application.I was able to get my Husbands hair done quickly and effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for evaluation purposes.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, I was a little skeptical about getting it. However, since product was sent to me at no charge in exchange for a unbiased review I decided to go ahead and try it! I&#x27;m glad I did! I normally have to color my hair at least once a month, however this paper color last much longer. My hair was so soft and shiny. this product smells great and is packaged nicely. I got so many compliments on my hair after I use this. My coworkers couldn&#x27;t figure out what I had done differently.</li>
    <li> Not as good as black magic which covered more gray</li>
    <li> Dyed my hair about a month ago, and it has recently faded a little bit to a very dark brown. Very impressed with the product. I swim a lot, and even that isn&#x27;t washing it out. Didn&#x27;t dry or damage my hair at all.</li>
    <li> Great product easy to use I love the out come. I have really short hair this was the perfect product for me. I don&#x27;t have to use much of the product for it to work. I have some gray hairs this product covered u grays really well. I think this product would be great for touching up grays around the hairline with out having to apply hair dye all over the head. I would high recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my MIL to try out. She had no problem with application. She waited the recommended amount of time and took it out promtly as directed. She said the steps were very easy to follow and very direct. She loved that there were more than one of these to use after fading started but she has gone thru 3 Washington without the slightest bit of fading yet. We were giving this set at a discounted one time price to give our honest review. She says she enjoyed the simplicity of this and would buy more.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this product. It was easy to apply, quite pleasant smell and it was quick. Lather in at beginning of shower wash out at the end and you&#x27;re done. It also leaves your hair feeling natural. Other dyes I have used, leaves your hair feeling dry and stiff. I highly recommend this. 2 thumbs up!</li>
