<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Even though it can get kinda clumpy as your applying layers, if your not careful.</li>
    <li> I like how the bristles separate the lashes better than most mascaras!</li>
    <li> This item gives a more natural look; it isn&#x27;t heavy or clumpy.  If you want the wow factor look elsewhere, but for everyday wear, this one is a keeper.</li>
    <li> great price and fast shipment.  TY.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a great mascara but I wish more would be wiped off when pulling out the wand.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It is also one of the first mascaras I ever tried back when I was a teen. I really love the thickness and length I get with this mascara. For the price of it you can&#x27;t go wrong! Covergirl is a great brand and this product is very nice. I always get it in the &#x27;Black&#x27; color and I have yet to be disappointed! I would definitely recommend this to others! :)</li>
    <li> I love cover girl products!</li>
    <li> Second mascara I&#x27;ve tried, and I loved it. Does it&#x27;s job, and it doesn&#x27;t clump. I really hate clumping, so I definitely wouldn&#x27;t have continued to use it if that were the case.</li>
    <li> I always like Covergirl Mascara, give a nice volume and great for daily use.</li>
    <li> this product is always my go to. I have almost tried every mascara on the market, from department store to super high-end, and this is cheap but amazing.</li>
    <li> This mascara is pretty decent stuff. In my experience it dries out faster then other brands but until it does i always have great results.</li>
    <li> Really like this mascara and the tiny brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was a bargain but it works as expected not the best I have ever used but not the worst either. I would buy it again if the price was right.</li>
    <li> Super deal on this. Product is ok.</li>
    <li> great price - and bonus - didn&#x27;t realize it came in a 3 pack!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this mascara twice here on Amazon and both times it dried out VERY quickly. When it was fresh it was a nice mascara, but since it dries out after a couple of weeks (and I don&#x27;t even use it everyday!) its not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I use this one everyday and I am happy with it. I have small eyelashes and I need mascara to make it fuller and Covergirl Lashblast Mascara did it for me! I would definitely recommend this one to a friend :)</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this mascara! Its always reliable!</li>
    <li> product works sameas other mascaras I have tried, clumps slightly, but not bad.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but not my favorite....helps more with length than volume</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly, great price!</li>
    <li> Pretty good mascara and a real steal for the cost.</li>
    <li> The best mascara in my life.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Not my favorite, but I think this works great and makes my lashes look thicker, but I prefer them looking longer.</li>
    <li> wow! i love this!&lt;br /&gt;http://payhmm.com/?ref&#x3D;37470</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this mascara. I pretty much love off of Mac and urban decay makeup except for my mascara</li>
    <li> I had not tried this mascara before but Amazon was offering a great deal with a coupon -  so I figured, why not?  I have started using it and really like this product.  The wand is nice and full and the coverage is smooth and not lumpy, so I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have always had dark eyebrows and hair, but fair skin and hazel eyes. (Irish/Italian!)&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows were a positive, defining point of my face. Well, am over 50 now, and my dark brows are about half white... UGH!  I have tried coloring, eyebroww pencils, shadows - but no luck.&lt;br /&gt;This is the FIRST product that has actually worked. Covers grey hairs and blends nicely. Takes a couple practice tries before &#x27;going public&#x27; - but you&#x27;ll catch on pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> The best price of this mascara! I usually pay double or triple in stores! My favorite mascara and glad I can find it for a great price. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I probably will never switch. I have short lashes, and it gives them unclumpy volume and still lengthens</li>
    <li> affordable and works really well. It keeps about 2-3 months which works out well. I use it daily and have never had an issue with smearing or smudging.</li>
    <li> Works great and my gf loves it</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s great for a drugstore mascara. It stays on all day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve received compliments on my lashes by a handful of people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I ordered 1, and received 3 by accident.&lt;br /&gt;So that was an awesome mistake on their part!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product. Didn&#x27;t make my lashes look great. Also this clumps. The thinner brushed mascara works best for me.</li>
    <li> great product &amp; seller!</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara, makes my eye lashes look thick and long, great application brush.</li>
    <li> This is my usual mascara - I bought it here because it was on sale at such a great price and as an add on to get to a free shipping.  I&#x27;ve bought expensive mascaras and this priced mascara and there is no difference except you save about 20.00.</li>
    <li> Not the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever had but it&#x27;ll do for everyday use. One downside is that there&#x27;s always a giant clump of mascara on the end of the wand when you pull it out.</li>
    <li> Spreads evenly without clumping. Far better than the mascara I was using before buying this.</li>
    <li> This is great!  Doesn&#x27;t clump and goes on easily!</li>
    <li> I wanted an every-day mascara that didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or look clumpy/stick together by the next day. For special occasions I use Younique, but I find it harsh on my eyes and difficult to remove. So I wanted a more every day product to use. This mascara fits the bill okay, but it&#x27;s certainly nothing special. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes going on or coming off and removes easily enough. May or may not buy again. It&#x27;s not memorable.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It doesn&#x27;t clump, and washes off easily. I&#x27;ll be buying this product from now on!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my daughter. She really likes the brush applicator.</li>
    <li> Best Mascara on the market.</li>
    <li> Really does extend my lashes out to here.  Do wish it had a narrower tip to make it easier to get the tiny inner eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I really like Cover Girl&#x27;s Lashblast Volume mascara. I like how it makes my lashes look longer and fuller, and is still easy to remove at night. I&#x27;m not really thrilled with the applicator, but I&#x27;ve found that most fiber mascaras have unusual applicators. I&#x27;d definitely purchase this again, though. It really helps with a natural but healthy look, and I&#x27;m pleased with yet another Cover Girl quality product!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara I&#x27;ve used it every since it came out. I&#x27;ve tried others and nothing compares to the full look you get with this. It doesn&#x27;t clump and you get longer fuller looking lashes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the applicator but the mascara does give me lashes more volume!</li>
    <li> This mascara is the best! It gets my eyelashes real long and curly!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara it goes on evenly and lengthens my eyelashes, it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mascara because there was a coupon combined with a low sale price.  The overall value was great (I think I paid less than $3); however, the actual quality of the product was so-so.  If you are used to buying drugstore brands, it may be a winner, but if you&#x27;re like me and tend toward department store brands like Dior and Benefit, then this will not make the cut.  Pros: It doesn&#x27;t flake or smear.  Cons:  It doesn&#x27;t add a lot of volume or length.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful mascara. It does make my lashes quite a bit thicker.</li>
    <li> Such a great price. Love this mascara.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mascara. No clumps and nice applicator.</li>
    <li> This mascara is good for the price. The application brush works well, and my eyelashes curl well with it. But, because this is cheap mascara it does smudge. Not as good as Mary Kay, but decent cheap mascara.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Really makes the lashes thick and the product does not clump. Easy to remove as well, not a huge smear all over the place :)</li>
    <li> Have loved this mascara for years, its the only one I use</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother. She said it was the best mascara she has ever used! Long lasting!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product. I got it at such a good deal.</li>
    <li> This is a really good mascara.  It was everything I expected and more.  It was nice not having to go to the store just to be able to pick it up and having to pick between 200 mascaras.  I was even able to use a coupon with my order thanks to my Prime.  The coloring is nice and the color last for the duration without clumping.  Give me a nice lash look as well.  No complaints with this one!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! Doesn&#x27;t clump or feel heavy</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara I will use.  No clumping and doesn&#x27;t flake off.  The brush gives great volume as well.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara doesn&#x27;t clump and goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> Classic from Covergirl. Holds a curl, doesn&#x27;t bother my contacts and I don&#x27;t have to reapply.</li>
    <li> its alright, cheap mascara that doesn&#x27;t clog up or clump. Comes off with water.  The bottle I got this time was broken.</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to.  Slightly clumpy but nothing crazy unusual.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Not my favorite mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t give much length.</li>
    <li> Great product great price.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite mascara and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy another kind.</li>
    <li> Read the blog of the Pioneer Woman who recommended this and said it was not a paid endorsement. Since she uses the product when filming her TV show thought I&#x27;d try it. First I love Cover Girl and have always  used their Long and Lush Mascara, now Lashblast is my go too. I love water-based mascara as I like the no fuss removal. Last all day with no clumping. Wear contacts and no problem with flaking or smudging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for several years and I love it! It goes on smooth and as thick as you want it without clumping or giving you Tarantula eyes!</li>
    <li> Perfect, not clumpy. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Awesome Mascare!  I love the want, no more clumpy eyelashes!</li>
    <li> I tried this, thought I could use to replace my mom expensive mascara.  Nothing wrong with it really, just wasn&#x27;t impressed.  Used a few times and passed on to my sister.</li>
    <li> I like the thickness of it and it makes your eyelashes look thick.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> love the thick wand it covers each &amp; every lash</li>
    <li> This is okay but I had to give it to my daughter as play makeup because I didn&#x27;t like the look of it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my eyelashes look full :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but it is not as good as I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> As described, Thank you</li>
    <li> GREAT mascara!!! The brush is amazing, and this makes lashes look great!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara. It is easy to apply, looks great, and washes off easily at the end of the day. The brush also helps make sure I don&#x27;t get spider lashes, which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love cover girl products and love this mascara gives that extra &amp;#34;ump&amp;#34; that you need for your lashes without have to spend alot of money!</li>
    <li> My lashes are not &#x27;blasting&#x27; and don&#x27;t seem more voluminous with this product.  Won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this another try 10 years layer but to no surprise it&#x27;s watery and doesn&#x27;t dry at all. No volume or length. Just hard spider lashes that are clumpy. Do not waste 5 bucks on this mascara</li>
    <li> I love this lash blast volume and the clump free as well.</li>
    <li> Love it. Looks great. One of the best mascaras one owned.</li>
    <li> Not bad for drug store product. I don&#x27;t like the brush though.</li>
    <li> This is a nice mascara. I can get it here much cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I brought one from this company. I suspected this is an expired product or really old. The content smells bad, it comes out as a lump and it won&#x27;t apply to the eye lashes. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so awesome to be able to add mascara on to my bigger ticket items. Just wish a Amazon would ask me if I need add ons at the end of each transaction. It would save me a trip to Target!</li>
    <li> BEST mascara I have ever found, I have been wearing it for year and will not change!</li>
    <li> I have asian lashes and this product didn&#x27;t work for me. It didn&#x27;t hold and curl and gave me minimal length. If you have longer and naturally curly lashes it may work better for you</li>
    <li> Best mascara out there!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s messy and grayish. Takes a while to dry.</li>
    <li> Made a mistake and did not order the waterproof product.  Was my own fault.  Looked at so many and just slipped up.</li>
    <li> I think the tube I got must be old because the mascara is very thick and clumpy. And I hate the brush. It is huge and it is impossible to apply the mascara to your bottom lashes without making a huge mess. I tried cleaning and using the smaller brush from my old mascara but the stuff is too thick so I got fed up and threw it away.</li>
    <li> This product is &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;.  I do not know if it is old, or if it is supposed to apply like that.  I have tried many CoverGirl mascaras over the last 30+ years, but this one I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> caused some irritation..  Put it on one eye to try,</li>
    <li> One of my favorite mascaras.  Easy application that brings out some fullness to my otherwise boring lashes.</li>
    <li> PURCHASED AS A GIFT FOR SOMEONE.  THEY LOVED IT!</li>
    <li> I love this brand. I have used other products and I will now be using this mascara from now on. A MUST HAVE.</li>
    <li> I love it, will order again</li>
    <li> Really globby. It turns all of my eyelashes into one eyelash. If i give it one or two passes over my lashes it&#x27;s okay but anymore than that and it is very clumpy. Even when I wipe most of the mascara off, there is a very fine line between &amp;#34;wow my lashes look amazing!&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;crap it&#x27;s all clumpy now&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> works great and lasts all day</li>
    <li> All I use for makeup is covergirl, so i knew buying this mascara was a must! And I was right. I would definitely recommend this mascara to anyone!</li>
    <li> As usual, great product from Covergirl</li>
    <li> Tried this today and it work great.  Lasted all day with no irritation.  The color was as described.</li>
    <li> Great mascara! I think I have finally found a product I can stick with. Doesn&#x27;t clump and separates well.</li>
    <li> I have asian straight lashes, and am quite picky on mascaras. This is a good mascara as it does not clump and builds volume, but it weights my lashes down. Also, after it dries, it makes the lashes really hard! I don&#x27;t like that.</li>
    <li> As good as any luxury brand!</li>
    <li> love covergirl products. easy to wear, lasts for a long time, and fits me perfectly. thank you for letting me try it for little amount of money</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara. I know they have a lengthen/volume edition, but frankly my lashes are long enough, just not thick enough for me. This does the job perfectly, and it&#x27;s easy to layer for even more drama. Just don&#x27;t go for the waterproof! It&#x27;s sticky, hard to remove, and I end up pulling out lashes every time to get the stuff off!</li>
    <li> Great mascara, makes my eyelashes look really long and full</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have used in years. It applies well and easy due to its very well designed brush. It curls the lashes and defines them as you like. If you want more volume (as I like) just apply for couple of times more and voila, you got fabulous movie star lashes. I was afraid it would flake after a while but no, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love the cover girl lash</li>
    <li> Love it! Wore it to a funeral, crying, and no running!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! Makes my lashes look fabulous!</li>
    <li> Actually makes me lookl like I have eyelashes.</li>
    <li> love this mascara! I reorder every time I run out</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have this mascara in my purse! It&#x27;s perfect! It doesn&#x27;t flake off like some cheap mascaras. I prefer a dark black and this does the job. I love the orange tube because it&#x27;s easy to find in my purse. The mascara wand is unique and doesn&#x27;t allow build up of chunky mascara! I get a ton of usage out of this mascara before I have to buy a new one! I don&#x27;t feel like I ever waste any because it dries out either!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product of high quality and easy to use. Worked all day!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I had in mind.</li>
    <li> If it didn&#x27;t clump at times I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied.  I use this mascara as a base for my Younique 3D Lashes.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!  Makes my puny little lashes look great but still natural looking!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. My girlfriend is allergic to most brands and this one does not irritate her eyes. She get large lashes from this product.</li>
    <li> Besides a little clumping (as expected because I&#x27;m not that great at applying mascara), it&#x27;s great. I love love love the product, and it keeps my eyelashes fancy. The smell is kind of funny, but it&#x27;s not bad enough for me to really care. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love how my eyes pop</li>
    <li> This is my favorite &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; make up product by far. I am a die hard definicils mascara fan, however, spending $30 on mascara is not always in the budget. So I always have Covergirl Lash Blast on hand. I&#x27;ve tried the other lash blast formulas but like this one best. It goes on smoothly, lengthens, and volumes perfectly, and I&#x27;ve never had a clumping issue. The black and blackest black are both great!</li>
    <li> a great go to mascara that applies evenly and boldly with a few coats. Great for thickening</li>
    <li> This mascara is AWESOME. Comparable to the $20 mascaras I&#x27;ve uses in the past. Long eyelashes and no clumps !</li>
    <li> Good product! Easy to use! Very happy!</li>
    <li> Been using it for years. Stays on better than most mascara that isn&#x27;t waterproof.</li>
    <li> This mascara is at a great price and very effective. My old mascara would come off in 2 hours but this mascara stays up to 6 hours, for me :) It is super easy to apply :)</li>
    <li> My favorite part about this mascara is the brush. I had accidentally put this on auto-order, but now am so happy I did. My eyelashes seem to not all grow in the exact same direction and this brush does a FANTASTIC job of getting in between them and separating them. I also like that it&#x27;s tapered at one end because it makes it easy to get in the corners and to fix / make any touch ups.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t really like how the wand felt, but I got over it quickly. I only needed to apply two coats, and it lasted all day. My eyelashes didn&#x27;t clump together, and were definitely fuller. The color was as expected, black. It wasn&#x27;t a light black either. I am very happy with this mascara!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It never clumps. It dries quickly. It stays on perfectly all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I bought because Amazon had a coupon and it was on sale. It was easy to apply did not run as much as my usual mascara causing the nasty raccoon eyes. It has great coverage, truly black and looked fantastic! I would definitely recommend and buy again!</li>
    <li> Great Mascara! One of my favorites! Fuller, thicker, longer lashes is what I get when I use this stuff, I noticed it lasts a long time in the tube too.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have found. It goes on thick without clumping and makes my lashes look long and lush. I&#x27;m sure there are some that do better, but they also cost A LOT more. I will randomly try other kinds, but keep coming back to my lashblast Covergirl.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It&#x27;s been my favorite for years. I&#x27;ve tried others but nothing compares! Great price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great product and non irritating, price was wonderful with a coupon too!</li>
    <li> Love the mascara, no clumps and stayed put all day!</li>
    <li> Its amazing it really gives my lashes a lot of length,but not much of a volume but i sure love this!</li>
    <li> I find there are a lot better mascaras out there. This one just left my eyelashes super clumpy</li>
    <li> I just started wearing the mascara today!! I like it so far</li>
    <li> The title says it all. This is by far my favorite mascara - not only because it&#x27;s affordable, but because it makes my lashes look awesome.  The applicator is easy to use &amp; doesn&#x27;t get those clumps of mascara in it, the bristles don&#x27;t fall out &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave me with spider-like, clumped lashes. I get complements all the time on my lashes too.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this mascara. I normally use CoverGirl Lashblast Length mascara, which I adore, but I thought I would try this one since it was still Lashblast and it was cheaper (on Amazon). Never again! It has a wetter formula which smears and clumps. I end up with more on my face than on my lashes by the end of the day. I almost never throw out beauty products, but after trying to work with this mascara for almost two weeks, I tossed it straight in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara. It does not clump and washes off easily.</li>
    <li> I only tried it once, and was disappointed.  To be fair, I had quit wearing mascara some time ago and just decided to start again. I tried this once, and did not have the look I thought it should have.  I could barely tell I had any on, and it was just more trouble to keep applying than I wanted to go through.  So, I don&#x27;t know that the product is poor, I just think I&#x27;m really past wanting to deal with it.  I&#x27;ll keep it around and try it again for a party or something, but I won&#x27;t be wearing it every day.  Personal choice, not bashing the product.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s clumpy and the tip is blunt. I prefer a pointy tip.</li>
    <li> Great big beautiful lashes ladies. That is all I need it for and it is great. Don&#x27;t forget to remove it at night. I use make up wipes to remove it.</li>
    <li> Great mascara! Doesn&#x27;t clump and lasts all day. Couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s, but I don&#x27;t really see how this is worth more than any other decent brand. We bought it with a coupon, so it was a good deal, but I&#x27;m not sure I would buy it at full price.</li>
    <li> Makes my eye lashes stick together doesn&#x27;t make them look full</li>
    <li> This is probably one of my favorite inexpensive mascaras, it&#x27;s super easy to apply, affordable, and makes your eyelashes look amazing! I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this clumping, it always stays on, and is super easy to remove.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not some sort of mascara snob but I did tend to switch around between all the drugstore brands. Once I found this one, though, I bought it only and so I have it on order with Subscribe and Save. Subscribe and Save is perfect for me with this sort of item which I would probably use until it was no longer really good otherwise. By having it come to my door at a set interval, I know I can just toss the old one and start fresh.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth. No clumping.</li>
    <li> The quality that I have come to expect from Covergirl.  You will not be disappointed with this product. It is easy to apply and easy to remove.</li>
    <li> The best formula ever for huge lashes, just be aware that is not lightweight.</li>
    <li> These seem to make my eyelashes look perfect. No clumping issues or anything! And at $1.99 THANKS TO THE COUPON IT IS THE CHEAPEST I HAVE EVER SEEN IT!</li>
    <li> Disappointed. Really tends to clump. Throwing away.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find a mascara that I love more than this, The style of the brush helps add length while sepearting the lashes and the formula does not clump or create fall out.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite, hands down, all time, most beloved mascara, ever. I have tried other brands and types, but I always always always return to this one. It goes on with ease, doesn&#x27;t clump, and takes additional coats without matting my lashes together. It stays on all day, does not flake, and comes off easily with makeup wipes at the end of the day. The color is rich, the formula is thick, and it makes my lashes look longer and fuller. This stuff is the best!</li>
    <li> The color was okay, but I had serious clumping issues when applying this mascara. I quickly switched back to my old favorite, Maybelline Great Lash.</li>
    <li> This mascara is by far the best I have ever tried. It&#x27;s a keeper!!!</li>
    <li> EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.  MY FAVORITE BRAND.  THIS IS THE BEST MASCARA OUT THERE.  AND IT MAKES YOUR EYES LOOK INCREDIBLE</li>
    <li> I used it as soon as I opened the box yesterday and it was great didn&#x27;t smudge or burn my eyes!!!  Thank You</li>
    <li> Great mascara.  It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve used for a few years. It was better when it firs came out but is still a really great mascara!</li>
    <li> This mascara give me fuller eyelashes compared to the Elf brand I previously was using. My lashes stood out and didnt clump together at all!</li>
    <li> love this product and will buy over and over</li>
    <li> I love love love this mascara. It defined my eyelashes and wasn&#x27;t clumpy!</li>
    <li> I am not satisfied with how full it gives my eyelashes. Will keep using it but will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Pretty average for a drug store brand. No complaints but not amazing. A nice price and a nice product</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for over 6 years now, and I cannot find any other that i love as much as i love this one, it is absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> Since Covergirl did away with the mascara in the dark gray bottle, I had to try something new.  I have used the old formula and the old brush for years and years.  The old brush looks very similar to this one, with the little pointy rubber nubs, but it&#x27;s about half the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, fine lashes, so I need volume.  This was very gummy and sticky.  I hated that the brush is SO FAT.  It doesn&#x27;t allow for controlled, detailed application and it gets all over my eyelids.  Because it&#x27;s gummy and sticky, it just smears when I try to wipe it off.  It makes a mess, and I hated that part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a few uses before the mascara gets to a nice consistency.  I did like the consistency and it did stick onto my eyelashes a really well and made them appear thicker.  I tried using my old brush, but the mouth of this bottle is much larger, and it wouldn&#x27;t wipe the excess off the old brush.  So I am stuck using two brushes:  The one it came with to try and apply it, and then my old brush to de-tangle and get the mascara all the way from the root to the tip of the lashes.  The brush it comes with is so fat, I can&#x27;t apply it to the tips of my lashes because they bend back and touch my eyelid and I end up getting it all over my eyelid.  Plus it just &#x27;pushes&#x27; on the lashes, the individual rubber nubs don&#x27;t get in between the lashes to separate and apply between the lashes like the old brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still searching for the perfect brush/mascara combination.....sigh.</li>
    <li> All the reviews are absolutely correct!!!  We don&#x27;t typically buy Cover Girl but this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> So far, no irritation from product this, which I&#x27;ve experienced with some other brands in the past.  Seems to adhere to lashes well.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara. The brush makes it so there&#x27;s not too mascara on the brush when you apply so that it gives a nice light coat and doesn&#x27;t clump up much. It also keeps my eyelashes very flexible instead of rigid. It also isn&#x27;t flaky so I don&#x27;t end up with raccoon eyes by the end of the day. I would definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> Washes off nicely.  Don&#x27;t love the brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using CoverGirl Lashblast Mascara, Black 805, almost a year and I love it. No clumps, smudges or flakes.</li>
    <li> My daughter has used this mascara exclusively for years and loves it.</li>
    <li> Thickened my lashes better than more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for years and have ways loved it. Almost everyone I know uses it as well. I have tried others here and there just to see how they work, even expensive &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; mascara, and I always come back to this kind. It is THE BEST out there.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this mascara for your everyday go-to.  Gets better with a few days to dry up a little after opening.</li>
    <li> I love this. I had used a few &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; mascara products before. I actually had one make some eye lashes fall out, so I switched to a more expensive brand called benefit. A friend recommend this cover girl one to me and I will never go back. My lashes look wonderful. It&#x27;s not too pricy. It comes off easy when I want to remove it but it last through the day. This is my new holy grail product.</li>
    <li> This mascara is the best I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them!  This mascara and applicator give a full and long, but more natural look than most mascaras on the market.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price! I bought this for a granddaughter.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy to be giving it to,her - especially at this price...&lt;br /&gt;Sure makes me look good!</li>
    <li> Great quality and the price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> I didnt really like it. There eere bits of the brush from the very first use that came off while stroking your lashes with the mascara. It also smudged under my eyes before days end.</li>
    <li> This CoverGirl Lashblast Mascara did give me a boost of fullness and length, but not after one application. I did allow it to dry in between applications, and I applied it three times. (Usually only two if I&#x27;m only going to work.) The best part is that at the end of the day I did not look like a raccoon, which happens a lot with intense mascaras. I used the extra coats because I was going for a false eyelash look, and this gave it to me with a bit of effort. Nice makeup!</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara because of the price. Usually I pay $10 so I wanted to try this one out. But I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again. I curled my eyelashes high up and when I put this mascara on, it lowered my eyelashes. Like I never even curled them!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a famous tv chef. It looks great initially.  Goes on smooth. But then it flakes everywhere.</li>
    <li> I have very long lashes and wanted to try a thickener/volumizing mascara. Right away I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the wand and brush. The wand isn&#x27;t easy to hold and I just don&#x27;t think the brush does much for volumizing. It kept my lashes separated but just didn&#x27;t do much other than add color and maybe a little volume. I&#x27;ll stick to Revlon or Almay next time.</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage! Excellent color! Great quality I have grown to love from COVER GIRL!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good mascara the only problem is that it makes your lashes look grey.</li>
    <li> Best mascara on the market. My lashes are perfectly separated and full. I have been asked by several people if they are false lashes. I never leave home without it!</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara I use.  Always perfect, never clumps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this mascara. I bought the other variety with that&#x27;s designed to minimize clumps, but this one is much better at volumizing and highlighting your lashes, plus it does it with less clumping than the so-called clump crusher variety in the green bottle. So far I haven&#x27;t worn it out long enough to determine how flaky it is.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like the brush or the consistency, but works pretty well for a cheap mascara. I think Ill go back to Cover Girl Lash Exact Mascara. It has less in the bottle and costs slightly more (not a lot) but I like it better.</li>
    <li> I used to love lash blast but for some reason it doesn&#x27;t seem to last nearly as long anymore I feel like I run out of it so quick and I don&#x27;t wear very much ! Maybe it&#x27;s just me but would like it to have more product !</li>
    <li> I use lashblast everyday and have been for years, it&#x27;s my fav!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this mascara.  I love it. I didnt think much of it at first but after two coats my eyelashes look beautiful.  No flaking through the day, no clumping issues. Aside from the great price this is a great mascara too. I think I&#x27;m switching from Maybelline great lash to this.  Great everyday mascara.</li>
    <li> is the best product for the eyelashes, covers a whole and there are no clumps my eyelashes look defined and long</li>
    <li> Everything was great...shipped as expected...no problems.  Thanks for the great service.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara for when I&#x27;m not wearing eyeliner. It separates each eyelash beautifully.</li>
    <li> Awful product.  I tried it because I had a coupon but I ended up having to throw it away.  It was incredibly flaky and messy.  I constantly felt like there was something in my eye due to all the flakes, all day long.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever! It volumizes my eyelashes pretty good! I have small thin eyelashes so finding the right mascara is hard for me. Best thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t clump my lashes</li>
    <li> My favourite, my only problem it gets dry so soon</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product.  It is clumpy on the brush and it doesn&#x27;t separate the lashes.  It just clumps them together.</li>
    <li> Excellent mascara. Doesn&#x27;t smudge. Lasts forever!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara.  I have super sensitive eyes (dry eyes) and everything bothers them, tiny imaginary fuzz, wind blowing, etc.  I&#x27;ve tried the mineral kind, hypoallergenic, etc. and this is still the best. When its empty, once and awhile, I will venture out and try the new latest brand and end up kicking myself running back to the store and get more Lashblast.  I wear a couple layers and there is no flaking and doesn&#x27;t come off until I remove it.  Even if I sweat, there is no raccoon to be seen.</li>
    <li> great for thick long lashes</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay mascara, but it did not extend my lashes at all and the brush is clunkly.  I&#x27;ll stick with MAC.</li>
    <li> Covergirl mascara is an excellent product, i love it. I recomended it 100% love it love it love it love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought for girlfriend, she says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my go-to mascara. No smudges, easy to remove and the brush is great a getting all the lashes without clumping. The formula is not too wet and there isn&#x27;t excess product on the brush when you remove the wand from the tube.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara Cover Girl makes.</li>
    <li> its cheaper online,  and works just like you&#x27;d buy it in the store. totally worth the wait</li>
    <li> great product awesome price fast shipping</li>
    <li> Work&#x27;s so well darkening and defining lashes.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite mascara, I have been using it for years!</li>
    <li> Cover Girl has always been a staple on my makeup bag.  I like that their products do not irritate my skin.  I have very sensitive eyes &amp; also wera contacts and had no issues what so ever using the Lashblast Mascara!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara. It&#x27;s the only mascara I will ever wear anymore. It makes my lashes nice long, and full with minimal to no clumping. My only complaint is that it burns my eyes pretty bad (if I cry, get teary-eyed or go swimming while wearing it) but I solved that issue by purchasing the same brand in waterproof for those occasions. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> I use this mascara every day.It literally never runs out! The quality of the brush is amazing. It gives definition to your lashes and a dramatic appeal, depending on how you apply it. Otherwise, it can also give a very natural look. BEST MASCARA. Covergirl rocks!</li>
    <li> I usually buy &amp;#34;nicer&amp;#34; mascara&#x27;s (Lorac, Stila, Tarte) but after reading the reviews for this I thought I would give it a go since it&#x27;s considerably cheaper. I was actually really impressed! I love the design of the brush, it ensures that you have nice separated lashes and that there are no clumps. I definitely will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> It always forms clumps on my lashes. Did not like it.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara as of late. The brush always gives me an even coverage.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. Works great :)</li>
    <li> It looks nice for the first hour or so, and then sheds little black flakes all over underneath my eyes.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really like the shape of the brush and how it applies the mascara. Best mascara product I&#x27;ve bought in a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!  I have tiny thin lashes and it&#x27;s really hard to find a mascara that makes my lashes look great and with Cover Girl Lashblast my lashes don&#x27;t just look great they look amazing! If you want noticeably  longer lashes with tremendous volume and no clumps you can&#x27;t go wrong with Cover Girl!</li>
    <li> Clipped the coupon and scored this for .78! Awesome deal and great product!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara of all the ones I have tried</li>
    <li> Flakes everywhere. I don&#x27;t care what coupon you put on this deal, it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> love this mascara....doesn&#x27;t smudge!!!</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth application</li>
    <li> I keep going back to this mascara after trying others.  This one is still the best in my opinion.  I&#x27;ve tried about every mascara under the sun and this one still stands out.  The brush makes it easy to apply and I have no clumpy lashes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this covergirl mascara for a friend, and she&#x27;s really happy with the results! I will buy one also :) Excited to try this!</li>
    <li> Hated this mascara! It clumped my lashes, did not add volume, and was super hard to get off! Even with makeup remover wipes. Do not reccomend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with this mascara - it does a decent job thickening, but didn&#x27;t really lengthen my lashes much.</li>
    <li> Originally purchased this mascara influenced by the great price.  I has performed well and my daughter also approves.  Nice rich color and covers nicely.</li>
    <li> I like this because it doesn&#x27;t take 15 minutes of reapplication before you can see it. It is dark enough and the non-waterproof version doesn&#x27;t come off until you wash it off. The waterproof version is VERY hard to get off and after a week it builds up, but this version does not. I think it&#x27;s very expensive and I have noticed that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other brands - I have to replace it more often. But it goes on cleanly and with a couple swipes, you&#x27;re done, so if you cost out your time standing in front of a mirror trying to get your eyelashes to show up, it is probably worth the price. Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t have any fibers in it - a plus.</li>
    <li> it is a great product, however, it makes my eyes water.  I only gave it 3 stars because it makes my eyes water</li>
    <li> Received this product yesterday and the package was opened I won&#x27;t use it because we can&#x27;t be sure it wasn&#x27;t tampered with</li>
    <li> nice you get 2, would buy again..</li>
    <li> Good waterproof mascara!</li>
    <li> Separates my &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34; lashes and gives them that &amp;#34;va-va-voom&amp;#34; without the dreaded tarantula look. I was never a fan of that type of wand (I always thought it would hurt/scratch my eyelids), but I&#x27;m a convert now. And you can&#x27;t beat the price, people!</li>
    <li> This was the first mascara I used. I tried a bunch of other ones over the years, but I always come back to this. Lasts all day for me and comes off so easily. I use mild soap and it comes right off.</li>
    <li> the product meet my expectations</li>
    <li> CoverGirl Lashblast Mascara has been my favorite mascara for years. Every once and awhile I&#x27;ll try a different mascara and regret the decision. Lashblast goes on smooth, evenly, and no clumps. I can usually get away with one coat during the daytime and just two coats for a night out. My lashes are sparse and with this, they are plump and give the illusion I have full, thick lashes! The Very Black is usually my go to color, but the plain Black works very well, making my eyes pop. I&#x27;ll never go to a different mascara again!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite, go-to mascara! It is easy to apply, the brush is great, and I have never had any clumping issues. This is meant for volume, but I find that it also gives me an impressive amount of length as well. Two super easy coats, and I am ready to go. I definitely have to replace it every few months, because as soon as it starts drying out it becomes much more difficult to use, but it is so affordable compared to the fancy brands I was using before that I don&#x27;t mind!</li>
    <li> This is my first CoverGirl mascara as this brand is not available in my country. I really like it as an everyday mascara as it does not clump so it gives your lashes a natural look. It lasts all day but comes off easily when you wipe it with a remover. Definitely a great buy considering its price.</li>
    <li> As far as cheap mascara goes...5 stars all the way. But , do keep in mind this is volumizing mascara. My lashes are long but thin, so it works perfectly for me--but if you&#x27;re lashes are thicker or you&#x27;re looking for length-- you might want something different.</li>
    <li> I like any CoverGirl mascara that is safe for contact lens users.</li>
    <li> There is nothing special about this mascara. It gets the job done for daytime use, but if you want something dramatic this is not for you.</li>
    <li> my favorite mascara!!!</li>
    <li> I love it finally I found a mascara that&#x27;s perfect!!! Great price!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this mascara.  It is easily applied and is long lasting.  I don&#x27;t get any clumps when using this product and it makes my lashes long and thick.  The price is great, this product is easily one of the best mascaras for the price.</li>
    <li> This mascara is great. Its easy to apply, last all day and no smudge.. 5 stars from me!</li>
    <li> Love Covergirl products, this one has not disappointed.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this, she loves it. Says it stays on all day and does not smudge. But she got black instead of brown, but she still wears it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Delivered on time and I love it!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara, I just prefer the waterproof version.  It stays on for a while, then ends up on my under-eye area.  Makes my lashes full though, and not clumpy.</li>
    <li> Wow! First use and my lashes are flawless! Super happy with look and quality</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Can never go wrong with Cover Girl.  I love the way this makes my lashes look longer and fuller.</li>
    <li> I just got it a few hours ago and had to try it immediately.. So far it is great.. I will defiantly be using it Covergirl Lashblast from now on :D</li>
    <li> thanks love covergirl found my new mascrara</li>
    <li> very easy to use I really like the fact the brush was outside the mascara and I had to put it in!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, only issue is that the brush is a bit too big for my lashes</li>
    <li> This mascara is not waterproof but I&#x27;ve had no trouble with smearing.  I had very oily skin and non waterproof brands tend to run.  I haven&#x27;t had that problem with this item.  I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Younique 3D fiber lash mascara is SO MUCH BETTER. www.youniqueproducts.com/kierstensoreano</li>
    <li> Covergirl what can I say! I love the brush part less clumping for me. It came on time fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Yay! Finally a new mascara to switch to! Makes my lashes look longer and fuller without clumping.</li>
    <li> I have used department store name brands of mascara for years, and this outshines them all. Doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t leave dark circles under my eyes by the end of the day. Stays on well, but also washes off well. Makes my lashes look long and full, but not overdone. I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> We (myself and daughter) hardly use makeup but mascara is one we do use. I have tried all kinds and this one seems to last the longest and not get flaky by the end of the day. Really like it and daughter approves too.</li>
    <li> This mascara has a great no clump formula that extense my lashes. I will definetly be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> What a great value, love this mascara!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. Goes on smoothly, no clumping and long wearing!</li>
    <li> I had to write about this CoverGirl Lashblast Mascara. I really like this mascara. The brush makes it so there&#x27;s not too mascara on the brush when you apply so that it gives a nice light coat and doesn&#x27;t clump up much. Too I recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Package arrived on time , and damage free! Very pleased with the quality and service!!!</li>
    <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t work well for me alone. I can only use it when layering mascara. It does nothing to show off the length of your lashes. So if you dont have natural long lashes you need to use something for length first.</li>
    <li> Good mascara no clumps and makes them really long and last threw out the day</li>
    <li> Nice applicator and easy to use.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes don&#x27;t really curl up. They&#x27;re rather straight so I have to curl the hell out of them when getting ready. This mascara is a bit heavy on my lashes so if I apply it from base to tip, it weighs down and my eyelashes are back to pointing straight. My solution is to only apply at the tip of my lashes. They look great, but it sucks I can only apply it this way to keep the curl that I want. It&#x27;s also a bit chunky I noticed. Not as smooth as expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a longtime CoverGirl fan and this mascara is certainly no exception to my undying devotion! Been using Lashblast for a few years now and have had a great experience every time. I&#x27;m getting older and need a few more quality tools to help my eyes look great, and CoverGirl has been there every time with not only mascara, but shadow and liner, too.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara ever!!  A couple coats and I am good to go for a whole day.  No irritation, no clumping, and cleans off easy with soap and water.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every mascara out there- drugstore and luxury- and this is the one that I always return to.  I have naturally long and thick eyelashes but this mascara takes them to another level.  I am constantly being asked if my eyelashes are false when I wear this mascara.  The fat brush fans them out and volumizes them beautifully.  I get VERY BLACK and my eyelashes look better than Kim Kardashians ;)</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite, not clumpy and feels light</li>
    <li> It works good. It stays on very well and doesn&#x27;t need to be reapplied throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I love mascara and cover girl products! This came in a nice timely manner and packaged very well. I use this daily and love it. I high recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received these for .25 cents with a great special going on as well as a great coupon.. So for the price you really can&#x27;t go wrong.. I have used and still use this product as I have for years now. No problems no issues , no irritation... Makes my eyes look bright and wide and wide awake even if I&#x27;m hungover the next morning,, Makes my eyes look good at least.. Yes I would order again.,, not for the prices they have on this product right now.. but if its at a great price yep it will be in my cart.</li>
    <li> I usually use falsies and I found an amazing deal on this so I figred I would try it out. It works amazingly and doesn&#x27;t get clumpy. The applicator is very easy to hold due to the size of it. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Love it! Long lasting, doesn&#x27;t smear or run.</li>
    <li> Application was easy, full coverage and no clumping.  It arrived on time.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff.  With the coupon, I got it for less than $1!!!</li>
    <li> really thick left big clumps in my eyelashs</li>
    <li> What a great add-on! Have used this mascara many times and like it. Helps to make my thin lashes thicker, but not clumpy.</li>
    <li> I have been blessed with long lashes and this mascara defines them and really makes my eyes stand out.  The brush is great and I swear the mascara gets better with age.  It doesn&#x27;t clump and I never get too much on, even with multiple strokes. I don&#x27;t have any smudges under my eyes at the end of the day and it washes off easily with water.  I have been using this for years and finding it here for under $5 is awesome!!</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with Cover Girl mascara!</li>
    <li> This mascara is great! I have quite short and sparse lashes and the unique style of the brush and formula makes my lashes quite long and full with just one coat! This formula also stays put quite well, with no flaking. I highly recommend this to others that want to make their lashes stand out for a reasonable price</li>
    <li> Nice coverage. Stays on all day and wipes off easily at night.</li>
    <li> I obviously was disappointed, did they mail me expired mascara barely anything coated my lashes</li>
    <li> I was surprised because I just didn&#x27;t expect to be that impressed.  I usually buy more expensive brands at the department stores or from Mary Kay.  I really loved this!!  I&#x27;m going to be buying it again!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara 😍</li>
    <li> it was a good product for a good price</li>
    <li> awesome mascara!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara ever!</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara pretty much since it first came out. Great for model/pageant make-up. Lasts long and is smear-proof. The only think I hate is that they changed the brush and you don&#x27;t get as much coverage as before and it seems to glob up more than it did before.</li>
    <li> This is an average mascara, I like it the best of all the cover girl types.  I will most likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love covergirl lash blastin the orange tube. this is the only mascara I like to use and its cheaper on here than in stores</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister, she loves it.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara, its one of the mascaras I use daily. Its a nice soft black and if you use it right (dont pump) it doesnt clump up to bad for the first month and a half but past that point i usually rinse my mascara wand with hot water to remove the old stuff so it goes on like new again.</li>
    <li> LOVE this mascara. Not too expensive and definitely works wonders.</li>
    <li> I liked this product over all. The only complaint I have is if I reapply it seems to be clumpy on my lashes.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with cover girl mascara.  It works great!  It is always my go to brand.</li>
    <li> For the money, it&#x27;s the best voluminous mascara out there. Always a safe bet.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best.  It goes on thick without having to apply a lot of coats, and it doesn&#x27;t clump.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of different mascaras (high end and low end) and I have never found anything better than this.  I&#x27;ve actually stopped looking and starting getting this through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save program- it&#x27;s way cheaper that way.</li>
    <li> great mascara. fast shipping</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the brush/spoolie but the product is great.</li>
    <li> I liked it, other than it seems to clump a little on my lashes if I try to reapply.</li>
    <li> Not a fan due to the brush. It&#x27;s good in case of an emergency and for the low price I paid it was simply acceptable, however, I would never pay the suggested retail price on this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice, i use with a sample od Dior fabric, and my eyelashes are huge</li>
    <li> If the brush hadn&#x27;t been orange when I opened the package, I wouldn&#x27;t even know there was product on it. This is the worst mascara I have ever used. I am a long time maybelline user, but tried covergirl when I ran out. They aree going for a &#x27;barely there&#x27; approach and I might as well have clear on.</li>
    <li> Got it by the promised date. Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> The color on this always seems to vary but I still like it overall. Best mascara for the price.</li>
    <li> OMG. at last i found my favorite mascara. for me the most important thing is that it is easily removable and it doesn&#x27;t leaves black &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; under my eye. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
    <li> Made my eyelashes appear longer.</li>
    <li> It just doesn&#x27;t do what my normal mascara does for my lashes.  In fact, I don&#x27;t get the fullness or length that I have with many other brands.  Disappointed in the product when there were so many good reviews.</li>
    <li> This stuff burns my eyes and I noticed that I was losing a lot more eyelashes than usual while wearing it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all-time favorite mascaras. It provides a lot of volume for not a lot of money. I have bought it probably 10+ times and am never disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is now my moms favorite mascara! I make my sister and mom a gift basket with makeup, perfume, hair accessories, etc and they love it.  This was a first time buy for this mascara and I will be ordering again. Not clumpy, doesn&#x27;t end up under your eyes after a few hours...love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good mascara but the brush is so fat and comes to a thick, blunt end that you cannot truly get to your inner lashes. Well, you can but you&#x27;ll end up blotting mascara all over your skin that you&#x27;ll have to wipe off.</li>
    <li> Great mascara. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> The kind I use at the right price.</li>
    <li> The mascara itself is nice, but the brush is annoyingly angled--bristles are shorter towards the applicator tip, making it really hard to get mascara on the lashes close to your nose without stabbing yourself in the eye.</li>
    <li> I thought I loved it. This was the first mascara I started using. But now all I see are random flakes throughout the day, and I only but one coat at most.</li>
    <li> Will use this mascara until they discontinue it, which sadly they always do.  Love it until then.  Love the Black.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product!  No clumps, provides volume, and it&#x27;s lightweight upon application.  Also gives a more natural appearance than the previous mascara I was using (of a different brand).  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years now, and I love it! I love the length and thickness it gives me. Really makes my eyelashes stand out. I will be using this forever!</li>
    <li> perfect!!  Love my mascara</li>
    <li> The product is just like any other mascara. Nothing exciting really</li>
    <li> I liked this mascara.  Didn&#x27;t clump.</li>
    <li> Good price and delivered on time!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara!  I get tons of complements on how thick it makes my lashes.</li>
    <li> This is just great mascara that covers well, has rich, thick coating in minimal amount of passes over your lashes.  It stays all day and I love the brush.  It is nice and flexible and allows you to get in to even the tiniest of lashes.  I like the chunky container because it&#x27;s easier to control than the slender tubes.  And the fact that it is a bright orange means I can find it in my make-up bag easily, because almost everything in there is in a dark shaded container, such as black or dark grey.  If you want nice thick lashes, this is the mascara for you.  It doesn&#x27;t cause eye irritation for me like a lot of the drug store brands do.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite. She likes it. What else can I say.</li>
    <li> My eye lashes are very thin, I love this because it make my eye lashes thick long a beautiful! I have not used anything else in 5 years!!!!</li>
    <li> good mascara. covers well without clumping. i feel pretty (bats eyes dramatically)</li>
    <li> Amazing thick long lashes for such a low price!</li>
    <li> This is a good mascara for the price as it gives quite a bit of volume, especially with 2 coats. The Black color is more natural vs. the Blackest Black and good to use when I want to get rid of the eyeshadow that tends to fall on my eyelashes but don&#x27;t really want to go for a full blown mascara look. I find it perfect for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush helps avoid clumps and keep a more natural look while providing volume and length. If I want to apply a second coat I usually brush my lashes with a small head toothbrush rather than a typical mascara comb to keep the volume and fluff. For more a more dramatic look at night I typically use MAC or other more expensive mascara. But this is my most used mascara for daily daytime work wear.</li>
    <li> Waited a long time to buy it because I was using other brand and I don&#x27;t like to spend money in something I&#x27;m not going to use. I heard a lot of good comments about. Super excited to use it, it made my lashes super long and I love it.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast works great!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and for a great price!</li>
    <li> My favorite Mascara of all time. Ive tried others, but this is the best</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, it doesn&#x27;t stand out from the rest of mascaras I have tried.</li>
    <li> This use to be my favorite but I see clumps</li>
    <li> these product does make your eyelashes look thicker, however is very frustrating the fact is that it doesn&#x27;t stop your eyelashes from clumping. It also dries too fast.the brush is very flexible. I would recommend this product if you are looking for a constant natural look. I wouldn&#x27;t recommendfor trying to and hands the look of your eyelashes</li>
    <li> Will always be one of my favorite mascaras (might actually be my favorite, only to be surpassed by the purple and black versions of this one) Love it!</li>
    <li> Wish I had bought more of these because this is now my favorite mascara.  Unfortunately, I only made one order just to try it and then the price went up.  Works great, doesn&#x27;t clump, extends lashes and comes off easily in the evening.</li>
    <li> This is my go to mascara.  It goes on thick, but it lasts all day and completes any makeup look.</li>
    <li> It is not as good as the reviews I had read. It does not give much volume.</li>
    <li> Looks great and I used it for years. Long story short- I kept getting horrible cornea abrasions from literally dust getting in my eyes. My eye doctor said my eyes were completely healthy. After about the sixth time of having to be shut in a completely dark room with an eye patch, I searched the Internet for what was in mascara. Arsenic! Along with lots of other toxic heavy metals. Although I could not find anything on mascara possibly cause my eye woes,after I had switched to natural mascara I quit having these issues. I got big chunks of sheetrock in my eye last month and had no issues. I don&#x27;t wear contacts or anything and changed nothing but my eye makeup and now my cornea is much stronger and does not scratch easily.</li>
    <li> This mascara is amazing!</li>
    <li> super great quality!!! Very good purchase!</li>
    <li> Thank you for the perfect pricing and for the convenience of delivery.</li>
    <li> The snort bristles on the end of the wand help with easy application without getting mascara on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one for a while and I love it. I like its brush and I think I&#x27;m gonna be using it for a long time.</li>
    <li> Can be a little clumpy.  I think I will stick with Clump Crusher from now on.</li>
    <li> Makes my lashes look so thick and full they almost look fake. This is replacing Maybelline Great Lash as my go-to mascara.</li>
    <li> I have bought this before and really like it.  However, I really like the waterproof much better.</li>
    <li> I love how it leaves my lashes, no clumps . When I tke it off my lashes doesn&#x27;t come off . I love it and I will recomend this product.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, and just as you&#x27;d expect to see it in the store.  I love CoverGirl products, especially when I can get them for a great deal like I did this time.  :)</li>
    <li> I love that kind of mascara i just ordered some from u all thanks</li>
    <li> Thank you for the opportunity to use this great product . This product is perfect in every way .</li>
    <li> Nice applicator. Good product. Easy to apply, lasts all day, good color.</li>
    <li> Always loved covergirl mascara</li>
    <li> Love the volume it gives my eye lashes</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great price!</li>
    <li> love cover girl products!!!</li>
    <li> Works great! Love covergirl, good buy!</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best product ever! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> one of the best ive tried so far</li>
    <li> this is one of my fav. of the covergirl mascaras</li>
    <li> This is a really good mascara, goes on bold, does add volume! Love it!</li>
    <li> I got this eye liner for 23 cents, and it&#x27;s amazing. The color is exactly as I expected. A dark black. It makes my lashes look full and a lot longer. It didn&#x27;t cause any irritation, and was easy to apply. It lasted all day. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more soon. It shipped on time and I received it in 2 days!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great!! I have tried many,many different brands and types of mascara. So far, this one beats them all. It brings out my lashes without clumping and is easily removed. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Looks great and the brush makes application so easy and does not leave your lashes clumped together.</li>
    <li> Awesome one.Good quality product</li>
    <li> Love anything Covergirl!</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price. Great gift.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! It works great, makes my eyelashes longer and fuller. It doesn&#x27;t flake like many others!</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara to add volume to my thin, sad lashes. I was pleasantly surprised how well this makes my lashes, especially for the price. My lashes look fuller with more volume without the clumps. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara ever! Lashes look big and full!</li>
    <li> The color is as expected I ordered black. It is very easy to apply, and it lasts all day. It does not cause any irritation. I most like it because it doesn&#x27;t clump no matter how many layers you apply.</li>
    <li> Love it and trust CoverGirl Products!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara thanks so much exactly as described !</li>
    <li> I jumped late on the bandwagon, but the iconic orange bottle has finally made its way into my holy grail list of products. It thickens my lashes enough to forgo eyeliner and does a little bit of lengthening besides. I love that the formula barely clumps on me, and the wand separates my lashes finely enough to look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara does flake sometimes, enough to irritate my contact-wearing eyes, and it smudges minimally after time (probably around 5+ hours) + sweat. The plus is that it&#x27;s an easy mascara to take off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m not having a super intensive day, then this is the first mascara I grab out of my pouch. Otherwise, I go for my tried and true Heroine Make mascara. But most days, this one does the trick.</li>
    <li> My favorite! Little clumping and makes my lashes look fuller.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara. It makes your lashes look thick, but not clumpy and if you apply it at the base of your lashline, it gives some lift and curl too! Love this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Covergirl has never failed me and I have used their products faithfully since I was a teenager. It is a low cost product with a very high value!</li>
    <li> Great quality, exactly what I hoped it would be. The brush is perfect!</li>
    <li> This is the mascara I&#x27;ve been hoping to find for years and will be sticking with from now on! Waterproof but comes off easily with soap and water. Love it! The cool thing too, it was a special price when I first bought it, but I&#x27;ll choose this at any price!</li>
    <li> Wife and daughter love this product...</li>
    <li> Coated my eyelashes evenly - I purchased the (BLACK) CoverGirl Lashblast Mascara and it was true to color. The wand was a perfect size, allowing me to get right into the corners to apply the mascara. I was able to fully coat my top and bottom lashes easily. I apply my makeup soon after I wake up *after my shower* and this mascara is still on my eyes at midnight when I go to remove my makeup for bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any irritation with this brand of mascara which is awesome because my eyes are very sensitive and I always have trouble finding mascara that will not make my eyes water and burn. I never like to go anywhere without this mascara in my purse in case I stay overnight at a friends house I always have it with me, my eyes are one area I like to put makeup on daily no matter what is going on - It makes me feel girly and I love how much it emphasizes my eyes. The lashblast kind really lifts and curls my lashes without any extra tools or primers (I did not even use my eyelash curler and was impressed with the curl). I was provided a discounted sample for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Love the mascara wand. Does not really clump my eyelashes. Gives it more volume than length.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. A lot of mascaras irritate my eyes, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes. It colors and separates my lashes!</li>
    <li> This mascara is wonderful.It does not get clumpy and it lasts all day long, no need to reapply it during the day!</li>
    <li> This is a great Mascara. It&#x27;s not fabulous but pretty close. It does not clump and stays on for a long time. I have spent up too $24.00 on Mascara in hopes to find the most fabulous mascara. I will say the $24.00 mascara was a rip off and this mascara by cover girl is 3 times better.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! Super non clumpy and lasts all day throughout school, highly suggest buying product!</li>
    <li> I have really long lashes so this product really helps to define them without looking clumpy. I use this in my daily makeup routine - it allows me to still have a natural look without my makeup being too dramatic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every mascara in the market, my eyes are really small and asian looking, and my lashes are very short, but I just have to apply this mascara two times, and and the change is huge. Love it</li>
    <li> I like this mascara, it&#x27;s really not anything super special but it is awesome for the price.  It really makes my eyelashes stand out and lasts all day.  I like the brush, too, as it seems to coat my lashes better than others.</li>
    <li> It was kind of disappointing using this product. I usually use Maybelline mascara but decided to give this a try. I only used it once. Never again. It did not make my lashes appear to be longer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t spend a lot of money on make up.  This was cheaper than local stores and is a reliable product.</li>
    <li> Not too happy. Tubes have less and less mascara in them (manufacturers lesson the contents and raise the price) and seem to run out in just a few weeks.  I had to put several coats of mascara on to make my lashes look long with this product.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, still the best one out there and just the right price.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara and find that it goes on nicely without clumping</li>
    <li> Not a replacement for my Lancome</li>
    <li> It was a bargain at under $2.00. I like the fuller brush. It doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!! Doesn&#x27;t clump when I put it on and lasts all day!  I do use it twice on each eye though just to make it darker.  Great price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I used this before and have always loved it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them all..even the high dollar ones. I always come back to this.</li>
    <li> Great product at an amazing price!!</li>
    <li> I was really surprised at how good this mascara made my lashes look. Much longer while separating and almost no clumps.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet. Great price</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara EVER.</li>
    <li> Great mascara, great price!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this mascara. Doesn&#x27;t get in her eyes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d always bought the standard Maybelline Great Lash mascara since it is typically highly rated as one of the best values for makeup but I don&#x27;t think I can go back after using CoverGirl Lashblast mascara. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the wand or the formula but my lashes are much fuller with this product!</li>
    <li> It does what I need. I use it to fill in my edges sometimes, also for my eye lashes.</li>
    <li> works as expected and great price.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!  This makes my lashes super long (without looking weird) and super thick.  It&#x27;s perfect.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and looks great.  And I can easily remove it with make up remover.  My lashes have stayed healthy while using this and none have fallen out from getting too dry from the product.  This is a great mascara.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed at how some companies like  Cover Girl can sell great products at such a low price...like this mascara for example, is considerably priced lower than other no good stuff. It lasts all day, goes on easily , and I&#x27;ve had my recent tube for about 5 months now and the mascara still doesn&#x27;t chump. It&#x27;s as smooth and soft-textured at it was the first use. It makes my lashes look very long and thick and I love that about it.</li>
    <li> My wife is completely satisfied with this mascara.</li>
    <li> i love this. its very light so it doesnt weigh my eyes down. it does give me more length which im super happy about cause i have thin eyelashes. it seems to last all day so far and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Loved this mascara. There are some I normally don&#x27;t like but loved this one!</li>
    <li> Loved it! Will def order again!</li>
    <li> Was clumpy couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> This is an alright mascara for everyday use. It coats evenly and you don&#x27;t need 5 coats to look like you&#x27;re wearing it. This is a great product for a teen learning how to use makeup.</li>
    <li> Love this thank you so much!!!</li>
    <li> It does what I expected it to do. I would prefer it to be a bit deeper with the color but that is fine for a more neutral look. The brush applicator is wonderful and as long as there isnt residue on my lashes I have found it to work fine as long as I apply let dry slightly and then apply again and curl if needed. Usually the curling isnt needed with this brand. But something a little phoom is good.</li>
    <li> Like the wand on this brush it makes my lashes long</li>
    <li> great it glides on easy and it makes my lashes look thicker but natural.</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara...it does not flake off and it is nice and dark. I really enjoy using it and will continue to do so</li>
