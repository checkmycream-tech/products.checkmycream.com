      <li>this product get the exact name because there are many loreal products to choose from.</li>
      <li>The first day, my curls were tender and perfect, defined but not matted down.</li>
      <li>By far my FAVORITE!</li>
      <li>all you out there that are looking for a great, reasonably priced product that really does make your hair soft, smooth shiny and frizz free</li>
      <li>And by no means does it keep hair straight for more than a day, (which it also promises).Does help to control frizz.</li>
      <li>This cream really tames my hair and leaves it smooth and silky for days!  </li>
      <li>my hair further to get it straight which made me really happy</li>
      <li>Although I loved the smooth intense Shampoo and Conditioner, this creme is too heavy for my fine frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>&amp; I got a more natural look &amp; feel to my hair.</li>
      <li>This finishing product of the L&#x27;Oreal smooth Intense line of products for unmanageable, frizzy hair really works.</li>
      <li>first time I used the creme</li>
      <li>The second day, which was humid, foggy and rainy, my curls were still mostly intact with no management (didn&#x27;t cover or protect while sleeping, didn&#x27;t use hair spray).</li>
      <li>I got a sample of this creme along with the shampoo and conditioner, and after that first use I immediately bought them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>and it is no exaggeration to say that I have bought 50 or more over the last 30 years.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!!</li>
      <li>I bought this creme because I couldn&#x27;t find l&#x27;oreal&#x27;s other frizz control (the alcohol free smooth &amp; shine creme) creme which I really like.</li>
      <li>The fact that this product worked so well without making my hair stiff or brittle was pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>The difference for me is that even though it is 48 hour frizz control, my hair appeared &amp; felt more softer with good subtle volume WITHOUT the need to flat iron</li>
      <li>Certainly doesn&#x27;t make hair as straight as it says it will.</li>
      <li>have had several people ask me what I use to get my hair so smooth and straight</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>Smooths hair together without too much weight.  </li>
      <li>I immediately felt the difference even before blow drying my hair straight when I applied the creme; there is heaviness about it as I combed out my hair that I don&#x27;t get with the smooth&amp;shine creme.</li>
      <li>I find it much cheaper on wallmart.</li>
      <li>I do not understand why L&#x27;Oreal seems to have discontinued this product for a similar named product (Smooth Intense Ultimate Straight Perfecting Balm) which is very inferior to the Oleo-Keratin Smooth Intense.  </li>
      <li>I have paid much more for other products that never worked as well as this line of products.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>Shiny but not greasy, straight but not stiff!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
      <li>It does help keep your hair straight, but also soft and silky.</li>
      <li>but since I&#x27;ve started using this creme, that has been reduced to a minimum, just a few minutes touching up with the straightening</li>
      <li>Soft, shiny, no more split ends, manageable, no frizz, pleasant silky sensation, easy to comb and lasts at least two or three days without having to wash it again.</li>
      <li>But with this new creme, xtreme</li>
      <li>What it would do for straight hair I can only imagine - sleek and glossy is my guess.</li>
      <li>I use it after shampoo and it leaves my hair soft and manageable..</li>
      <li>My hair is long and straight and chemically treated.</li>
      <li>I can even just wash my hair, apply the cream, let it air dry, and my hair will be shiny and wavy without much effort - not frizzy at all.  </li>
      <li>and I had someone ask me what I did to my hair as if there was a major change.</li>
      <li>I love this product, you just need to be careful to use an small quantity when applying.</li>
      <li>I have tried many other straighteners that are much more expensive, including one that you have to join a club to use, that don&#x27;t work half as well.</li>
      <li>Usually it&#x27;s just a quick touch up with the straightening iron.</li>
      <li>I only need to wash my hair every three days now, a huge benefit with long, thick hair.</li>
      <li>Before finding this creme, I was never completely successful in straightening my hair or keeping it frizz free.</li>
      <li>It is also economical because you only need a small amount; I use about a dime size and my hair is in the middle of my back.</li>
      <li>I also wash it every day and go to flat irons and blowers all the time, after trying this product, my hair, with no effort at all and leaving it dry with natural air</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great stuff.  Tried this when Humectress changed their formula.  Miss that one!  But this is very good.  Smooths hair together without too much weight.  Not greasy.  I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> Although I loved the smooth intense Shampoo and Conditioner, this creme is too heavy for my fine frizzy hair. A little goes a long way.  I get excellent results with their other products.</li>
    <li> Even without Keratin smoothing system this product helps to maintain smoothness.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product. I have tried my WHOLE life to find the perfect after shower cream that would make my hair look healthy after I flat-iron it. My Hair actually looked like it was from a commercial. Shiny but not greasy, straight but not stiff! My fried split-ends looked repaired and I had someone ask me what I did to my hair as if there was a major change. My endless search for the perfect hair product is over!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not worth for the cost</li>
    <li> I am from north Africa so my hair is extremely fizzy and thick. A few month ago, I fried my hair by trying to straighten it on a high temperature. I went to the hair salon and the stylist suggested that I start using this cream even if I am not using any heat on my hair. This cream is marvelous. If it worked on my rebeleous, untamable hair, it can work on any other hair. It really works. The only thing, it&#x27;s a bit costly on amazon. I find it much cheaper on wallmart.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my hair and it is the ONLY cream that actually makes my hair look good! I have graying, color treated, frizzy/wavy hair. (Sounds lovely right?) This cream really tames my hair and leaves it smooth and silky for days!  I can even just wash my hair, apply the cream, let it air dry, and my hair will be shiny and wavy without much effort - not frizzy at all.  It is truly amazing. It also works great with a blow drier or flat irons up to 450 degrees. I do not understand why L&#x27;Oreal seems to have discontinued this product for a similar named product (Smooth Intense Ultimate Straight Perfecting Balm) which is very inferior to the Oleo-Keratin Smooth Intense.  I will continue to buy this product on Amazon as long as I can. Highly recommend this product!!</li>

I have paid much more for other products that never worked as well as this line of products.&lt;br /&gt;For all you out there that are looking for a great, reasonably priced product that really does make your hair soft, smooth shiny and frizz free this is it!</li>
    <li> this is the best straightener I have ever bought. and it is no exaggeration to say that I have bought 50 or more over the last 30 years. it smells great and is lightweight and it lasts for 3 or more days. I cannot recommend this strongly enough. I will never use anything else this is the best!</li>
    <li> Anyone who needs a little curl/frizz control@ look no further, this stuff is great.  Little bit of this product goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. Certainly doesn&#x27;t make hair as straight as it says it will. And by no means does it keep hair straight for more than a day, (which it also promises).Does help to control frizz. John Freida&#x27;s &amp;#34;Frizz Ease&amp;#34; works as well or better and is less expensive.</li>
    <li> Before finding this creme, I was never completely successful in straightening my hair or keeping it frizz free. I live in a humid area so sometimes just going outside for a few minutes was enough to make it frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the creme I knew I was never going back to my previous products. It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave any stickiness on your hands. I only need to wash my hair every three days now, a huge benefit with long, thick hair. On the days that I don&#x27;t wash my hair, I rarely need to reapply the creme to keep my hair looking good. Usually it&#x27;s just a quick touch up with the straightening iron. My hair still looks and feels great during those days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair tends to frizz after exercising but since I&#x27;ve started using this creme, that has been reduced to a minimum, just a few minutes touching up with the straightening iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had several people ask me what I use to get my hair so smooth and straight and when they hear the brand and the price, they get very excited that good results are possible without paying a ton of money for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was still sold in stores in my area but I am happy still being able to buy it online.</li>
    <li> Miracle in a bottle. My hair is long and straight and chemically treated. I also wash it every day and go to flat irons and blowers all the time, after trying this product, my hair, with no effort at all and leaving it dry with natural air it looks like I am in the cover of a magazine. Soft, shiny, no more split ends, manageable, no frizz, pleasant silky sensation, easy to comb and lasts at least two or three days without having to wash it again. It is a rescue therapy for damage hair and a must in my daily beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I love this product, you just need to be careful to use an small quantity when applying.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. Even if I did not purchase the shampoo and conditioned, I would still buy this product because of the say it makes your hair feel and the smell don&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream ...I use it after shampoo and it leaves my hair soft and manageable..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve use for my hair. It leaves it smooth and manageable. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other straighteners that are much more expensive, including one that you have to join a club to use, that don&#x27;t work half as well. This cream smells great, isn&#x27;t greasy and straightens while giving great body. It is also economical because you only need a small amount; I use about a dime size and my hair is in the middle of my back.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this creme along with the shampoo and conditioner, and after that first use I immediately bought them on Amazon. Why? My frizzy curly loooong hair had defined curls with no crunchy awfulness for over 2 days. The first day, my curls were tender and perfect, defined but not matted down. The second day, which was humid, foggy and rainy, my curls were still mostly intact with no management (didn&#x27;t cover or protect while sleeping, didn&#x27;t use hair spray). That in and of itself was almost miraculous. By the third day, the curls weren&#x27;t as obvious but there was still no frizz. The fact that this product worked so well without making my hair stiff or brittle was pretty amazing. What it would do for straight hair I can only imagine - sleek and glossy is my guess. Try it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this before I read the reviews online on personal care sites. The kudos match the great way the product performs. It does help keep your hair straight, but also soft and silky. The seller got it to me very quickly. I recommend the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> I bought this creme because I couldn&#x27;t find l&#x27;oreal&#x27;s other frizz control (the alcohol free smooth &amp; shine creme) creme which I really like. The difference for me is that even though it is 48 hour frizz control, my hair appeared &amp; felt more softer with good subtle volume WITHOUT the need to flat iron my hair further to get it straight which made me really happy &amp; I got a more natural look &amp; feel to my hair. But with this new creme, xtreme 72 hour frizz control, my hair is flat! (&amp; boring without the least bit of volume or \\&quot;flow\\&quot;). I immediately felt the difference even before blow drying my hair straight when I applied the creme; there is heaviness about it as I combed out my hair that I don&#x27;t get with the smooth&amp;shine creme. I did not need to flat iron my hair with this product; it cannot get any flatter.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, my hair looks fabulous after using this product, good purchase</li>
    <li> this product get the exact name because there are many loreal products to choose from. This is just wonderful use very little it goes along ways. It protects hair from heat damage.</li>
    <li> Love how this makes my hair feel! Works nicely to control frizz.</li>
    <li> By far my FAVORITE! This is the ONLY creme that actually WORKS on my hair! I have color treated, bleached blond hair. Leaves my hair smooth and silky for days! Works great with flat irons up to 495 degrees. Highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Very good product...smooths well</li>
