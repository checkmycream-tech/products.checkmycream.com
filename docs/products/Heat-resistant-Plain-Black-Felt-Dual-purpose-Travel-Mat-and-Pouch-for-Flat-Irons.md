      <li>I just wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
      <li>Great product!  </li>
      <li>Great!</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>The travel mat and pouch works great in terms of heat resistance.  </li>
      <li>This works great.</li>
      <li>Not to happy with whateva kind of material</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This has been the best invention ever, love love love.  </li>
      <li>WHich I don&#x27;t have to worry about it catching fire.</li>
      <li>It does kind of feel like a piece of felt, but I&#x27;m hoping its some kind of hear proof material instead.</li>
      <li>Also is great for when she needs to carry it and its still hot.  </li>
      <li>I have seen better products.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my croc flat iron and it fits perfectly in it.</li>
      <li>For those of you who travel and who like to pack neatly, this pouch is perfect for any flat iron.</li>
      <li>The best flat iron on the market.</li>
      <li>Good price and works very well!</li>
      <li>This seems like nothing more than a cheap piece of felt from the dollar store.</li>
      <li>And when traveling it offers great protection and storage.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but nothing special.  </li>
      <li>Instead the cord has to be wrapped around the cheap felt case.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely a wise purchase and worth the money (which is reasonably priced in my opinion).</li>
      <li>If you have a flat iron or curling iron - great investment.</li>
      <li>I really like to be able to use my straightener and pack it right away into my suitcase or drawer.</li>
      <li>Better way to keep flat irons from touching counters</li>
      <li>Now I can put my iron away hot &amp; not have to worry about my son burning himself if he touched iron!  </li>
      <li>I have the FHI which gets pretty hot quickly.</li>
      <li>My flat iron fits perfectly and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it when I lay it down.</li>
      <li>Can even put the Croc in it while it is still hot.</li>
      <li>When I put it in my drawer, I put the hot iron in the pocket and the cords in the flap area.</li>
      <li>does what it claims - holds cord &amp; hot iron.  </li>
      <li>Product came exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>I use it when I travel and don&#x27;t want to put a HOT iron in my bag.</li>
      <li>Ive tried many flat irons but this one does it all!</li>
      <li>(The top of the toilet when I had no bathroom counter space BEFORE I got my vanity table.)</li>
      <li>I always had a problem trying to pack up my flat iron after i was done leaving the gym and now its so easy just put it in its case</li>
      <li>But works very well.  </li>
      <li>And it stores really well.</li>
      <li>The material is felt but does the job very well.</li>
      <li>It would be acceptable if the flat iron cord fit into the pouch, but this is not the case.</li>
      <li>No fuss, no mess, and it doesn&#x27;t take up more than the flat iron space.</li>
      <li>Thank you, BeautyOne, for this very useful Travel Mat/Pouch for flat irons.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve constantly worried about the damages my vanity table or the the toilet top would take if I placed my hot hair appliances on them.</li>
      <li>With the mat I can put my still hot appliance it it, wrap up the cord around it and put it right back in the drawer where I keep all my hair appliances and not worry about any damages.</li>
      <li>but I wish there was a little more space.</li>
      <li>The only problem that I have with it is that I wished the whole flat iron fit into the pouch rather than having the cord hanging.  </li>
      <li>The main thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product was that every surface you put it on (counter in the bathroom, on top of clothes in your suitcase, etc.) gets covered with tiny black fibers.</li>
      <li>I use my flat iron, electric hot comb and curling irons with this product.</li>
      <li>I set my flat iron on this when it is hot.</li>
      <li>but it is soft and the closing is velcro.  </li>
      <li>I often need to leave the house right after styling my hair but with my cat running around, I always worried he would knock it down and get hurt.</li>
      <li>I only let them cool a little</li>
      <li>The flap then valcros to the other side and the cords don&#x27;t get hot from the flat iron.</li>
      <li>It goes up to 430° in seconds and stays hot until you turn it down or off, plus my hair shines after i iron it!</li>

<li> My daughter uses it with her Croc flat iron.  </li>
<li> For size reference, I use the Blaybliss Flat iron pro.</li>
<li> I bought two of these to store my curling iron and flat iron.  </li>
<li> I always have to wipe off the ceramic plates of my flat iron before I can use it.</li>
<li> That is a minor detail.</li>
<li> This is a poorly made item which they just sewed a straight line to make a rectangular pouch, and then they stuck a piece or two of velcro on it to close the flaps.</li>
<li> Other than that it does what it is suppose to do.</li>
<li> Not a pretty product.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little flimsy compared to what i expected, but sufficient.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other iron, try it, you&#x27;ll like it too!</li>
<li> It makes a mess.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t even waste your money since you have to pay for return shipping.</li>
<li> I am not crafty</li>
<li> No more scorches on the countertop.  </li>
<li> I have the Maxiglide Xpress which is about 1.25&amp;#34; thick.</li>
<li> Its a little uncomfortable to put away both irons.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed at how poorly this item was made.</li>

    <li> I always had a problem trying to pack up my flat iron after i was done leaving the gym and now its so easy just put it in its case and I&#x27;m out. Great product.</li>
    <li> Thank you, BeautyOne, for this very useful Travel Mat/Pouch for flat irons.  And thank you for your excellent service.</li>
    <li> For those of you who travel and who like to pack neatly, this pouch is perfect for any flat iron. No fuss, no mess, and it doesn&#x27;t take up more than the flat iron space.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I use it when I travel and don&#x27;t want to put a HOT iron in my bag.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed at how poorly this item was made. It is basically a felt-like material sewn together. I am not crafty but I probably could have made this item myself.</li>
    <li> This works great. I have the FHI which gets pretty hot quickly. I set my flat iron on this when it is hot. When I put it in my drawer, I put the hot iron in the pocket and the cords in the flap area. The flap then valcros to the other side and the cords don&#x27;t get hot from the flat iron. Love it!</li>
    <li> My daughter needed a place to lay her iron to keep from burning things.  Also is great for when she needs to carry it and its still hot.  Not a pretty product.  But works very well.  I purchased one for a friend for her birthday too.  Good price and works very well!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but nothing special.  I don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve purchased it if I had seen it in person.  But that&#x27;s the risk of buying online.</li>
    <li> Product came exactly as described.  My daughter uses it with her Croc flat iron.  No more scorches on the countertop.  Can even put the Croc in it while it is still hot.</li>
    <li> It works - it does what I need.  It&#x27;s a little flimsy compared to what i expected, but sufficient.</li>
    <li> I use my flat iron, electric hot comb and curling irons with this product. I&#x27;ve constantly worried about the damages my vanity table or the the toilet top would take if I placed my hot hair appliances on them. (The top of the toilet when I had no bathroom counter space BEFORE I got my vanity table.) This mat definitely put me at ease with that. I often need to leave the house right after styling my hair but with my cat running around, I always worried he would knock it down and get hurt. I used to unplug it and leave it on the kitchen counter and close the door so he couldn&#x27;t get to it. With the mat I can put my still hot appliance it it, wrap up the cord around it and put it right back in the drawer where I keep all my hair appliances and not worry about any damages. It&#x27;s definitely a wise purchase and worth the money (which is reasonably priced in my opinion).</li>
    <li> does what it claims - holds cord &amp; hot iron.  Now I can put my iron away hot &amp; not have to worry about my son burning himself if he touched iron!  Great!</li>
    <li> This is a poorly made item which they just sewed a straight line to make a rectangular pouch, and then they stuck a piece or two of velcro on it to close the flaps. It is not even finished on the ends or edges. Don&#x27;t even waste your money since you have to pay for return shipping.</li>
    <li> The mat/pouch material sheds! I always have to wipe off the ceramic plates of my flat iron before I can use it.</li>
    <li> The travel mat and pouch works great in terms of heat resistance.  The only problem that I have with it is that I wished the whole flat iron fit into the pouch rather than having the cord hanging.  That is a minor detail.</li>
    <li> This mat has saved the lives of countless towels in my house!  And when traveling it offers great protection and storage.  When I am done with my irons I only let them cool a little and then I can store them in this, pack and go with out worrying about burning anything in my bags.  Wish I had gotten one sooner.</li>
    <li> It does kind of feel like a piece of felt, but I&#x27;m hoping its some kind of hear proof material instead. The main thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product was that every surface you put it on (counter in the bathroom, on top of clothes in your suitcase, etc.) gets covered with tiny black fibers.

    <li> I bought this for my croc flat iron and it fits perfectly in it. I don&#x27;t know what the material is but it is soft and the closing is velcro.  It works well enough for what I need it for so I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> My flat iron fits perfectly and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it when I lay it down. And it stores really well.</li>
    <li> If you have a flat iron or curling iron - great investment.</li>
    <li> The best flat iron on the market. Ive tried many flat irons but this one does it all! It goes up to 430° in seconds and stays hot until you turn it down or off, plus my hair shines after i iron it! I wouldn&#x27;t use any other iron, try it, you&#x27;ll like it too!</li>
    <li> I really like to be able to use my straightener and pack it right away into my suitcase or drawer.</li>
    <li> This has been the best invention ever, love love love.  I would recommend this product over and over again.  I can put my iron in this pouch instantly with no problems at all!</li>
    <li> I cannot say whether I like or dislike this product for I have not received it as of today November 20, 2012,</li>
    <li> Not to happy with whateva kind of material this is made out of. Other than that it does what it is suppose to do.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these to store my curling iron and flat iron.  I have seen better products.  Its a little uncomfortable to put away both irons.  Not enough space for the cords.  I gave it 3 stars because it does protect the counters.  I just wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
    <li> Better way to keep flat irons from touching counters</li>
    <li> I bought this to protect my luggage and traveling items from my flatiron. I have the Maxiglide Xpress which is about 1.25&amp;#34; thick. It fits but I wish there was a little more space. It&#x27;s almost snug but works well. The material is felt but does the job very well.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy from this seller..they did not refund my money despite my returning it; Product was flimsy, cord plug fell out. All it was was a piece of felt. I bought a different one with a teflon coating made by Vera Bradley on sale, same price. WHich I don&#x27;t have to worry about it catching fire.</li>
