      <li>Its adorable.  </li>
      <li>The eyelashes are awesome, and come in tones of different lengths which I love, and who doesn&#x27;t love the case??</li>
      <li>Im glad I didnt have any clients I planned using this set on</li>
      <li>I tried mixing them to dilute the fumes, but this wasn&#x27;t much better.  </li>
      <li>which my customers LOVE.  </li>
      <li>I think about two months ago, and I&#x27;m still using and still love it.  </li>
      <li>I have had to replace more than I should.  </li>
      <li>I just have used better before.  </li>
      <li>Anyways, I really do love this product and recommend it.  </li>
      <li>However, with this kit you get so much more...</li>
      <li>Highly impressed with this entire kit.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t realize I have them on most of the time.  </li>
      <li>This is the first week I have used this product, but I&#x27;m very happy with it so far.</li>
      <li>Super cute kit.</li>
      <li>This eyelash kit offers many unique, safe and effective items/products.</li>
      <li>The lashes look really cheap.</li>
      <li>This kit is truly amazing, I would highly recommend it and you cant beat the price.</li>
      <li>The only good thing was the tweezers.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without it!!!!</li>
      <li>I will use these because I have lost most of my own lashes due to age and medications.</li>
      <li>I used this product for the first time yesterday!  </li>
      <li>I think it is worth taking the time to do.  </li>
      <li>If it helps just one person avoid what I went through, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>But there&#x27;s a lot of stuff included, guaranteed fun.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try them out but waiting for right occasion.  </li>
      <li>Oh, it also came right away.</li>
      <li>Also included with this kit is a very cute cosmetic carrying bag that can be used for carrying other items after the products are fully used.</li>
      <li>This is the first review I have done.  </li>
      <li>I like the really light natural Voluma lashes and all the lashes in this kit</li>
      <li>I own a beauty shop and have been trying adhesives, one after the other.  </li>
      <li>but this glue company works well for me ; no redness or irritated very pleased n will order again soon and all the kit so far lasted me a long</li>
      <li>The glue was so strong, I could not open my eyes while the asthetician put them on.</li>
      <li>Not to mention that there isn&#x27;t any sealant either, which is HUGE part of the lasting process of the eyelashes.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves this item.</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t really like the glue.  </li>
      <li>, there was no CD  in the pakage,also the bag had the mirror broken,and the solution for eyelashe removal doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>because it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>In fact when her client was done she had lint glued to the lashes and took her several minutes to clean them.</li>
      <li>I purchased two different sets of these fun kits.</li>
      <li>You are really just paying for the glue, it is about $45-$50 itself, but you get the chance to try out different lash sizes and figure out what really works for you.</li>
      <li>Very clear instructions were provided in the DVD as well.</li>
      <li>I ended up loving the medium sized individual lashes, so I only bought those the next time I purchased and they are super inexpensive (less than $10 for a year&#x27;s supply of lashes).</li>
      <li>I have tried Alluring ultra plus and max sensitive glues, plus an assortment of cheaper versions.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>I have had the stays on glue on myself for a week now with no missing lashes.  </li>
      <li>did not come with instruction and the glue like was old.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s obviously a learning curve for those who are new to it.</li>
      <li>I would spend hours trying to get them just right, and in the morning there would always be lashes missing.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the whole kit because it didn&#x27;t make sense to just buy the glue alone, when you got quite a bit of other needed products.  </li>
      <li>Once you get the hang of this, you can add a few in the morning on your top lashes, it literally takes a few seconds to add a lash.</li>
      <li>The thing you have to ask yourself is, if salon glue smell and burns, do I really want that on my body anywhere, much less my eyes?</li>

<li> The thing you have to ask yourself is, if salon glue smell and burns, do I really want that on my body anywhere, much less my eyes?</li>
<li> In this kit you receive 3 cosmetic bags, small, medium and extra large.</li>
<li> I purchased this product a few months ago and just moved to a new salon and spa and tried the product out on a friend.  </li>
<li> This glue you can use YOURSELF, it has no odor and it does not burn, BUT the lashes only last a few days to a week.</li>
<li> I think the most valuable part of it would be the glue, but someone said the glue will go bad in a year or something.</li>
<li> This was not the case with the other products.</li>
<li> n can not handle other eyelashes glue</li>
<li> is what you should know about me - like other reviewers, I used to go to a salon and pay $100 for a set that lasted about two weeks.</li>
<li> She just tried them for a client and unfortunately she complained that the gel eye patches were not lint free as advertised.</li>
<li> The materials itself are average made in china-mart but bend when you separate them from the container.</li>
<li> I think the glue is going to last me at least a year.&lt;br</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t even know if I can return this so $130.00 down the drain.</li>
<li> I mean I still use the glue sometimes, especially because it doesn&#x27;t burn!  </li>
<li> They are lighter than the previous glues and knotted flares I have used.  </li>
<li> my clients love how long the glue holds up and it doesn&#x27;t have an awful oder</li>
<li> I would send it back if it was not too late!</li>
<li> and it isn&#x27;t heavy feeling.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had any clients call with missing lashes either.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this over priced kit.</li>
<li> Feedback from clients is heavy feeling eyes and missing lashes.  </li>
<li> Missing items described.</li>
<li> Just received my kit an item was cracked and it was missing some items.</li>
<li> But still, it really isn&#x27;t that bad.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why some people aren&#x27;t getting the kit as outlined?</li>
<li> Glue sucks.</li>
<li> were thick and spindly ones.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll admit, I was a bit skeptical before using the glue, as I&#x27;ve had negative reactions to other lash glues, but, just as the item is described, the glue proved to be non irritant as I had no reaction at all.</li>
<li> Im not happy with what a got, the description said that it was a kit with a instructional CD</li>

    <li> I never figured out how to use this and am currently getting my lashes done now! I would send it back if it was not too late! I think the most valuable part of it would be the glue, but someone said the glue will go bad in a year or something. Anyway, it was too complicated for me to use on myself. If I am stuck with it, I will look at it again maybe for costume parties or something. I like the really light natural Voluma lashes and all the lashes in this kit were thick and spindly ones.</li>
    <li> Highly impressed with this entire kit. This eyelash kit offers many unique, safe and effective items/products. Also included with this kit is a very cute cosmetic carrying bag that can be used for carrying other items after the products are fully used. I&#x27;ll admit, I was a bit skeptical before using the glue, as I&#x27;ve had negative reactions to other lash glues, but, just as the item is described, the glue proved to be non irritant as I had no reaction at all. Very clear instructions were provided in the DVD as well. Great Product!</li>
    <li> This is a great kit for a great price! Next to this kit I would only consider the Korean Mink Eyelash Kit. However, with this kit you get so much more...In this kit you receive 3 cosmetic bags, small, medium and extra large. Plus 4 cases of mink individual lashes, a set of regular individual lashes and a set of 4 altogether lashes. You get a cleanser for your lashes to ensure no residue before application, lint brushes, application brushes, tweezers, an glue ring, 1- glue and 1glue remover. It would have been great for more glue, since everyone raves about it. Also, mascara, adhesive tape and DVD. An extremely good value! Oh, it also came right away. I ordered on a Friday and it was here Monday.It was sent priority mail and it was great to know it showed up so fast with everything in perfect order. I would order again.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time yesterday!  The eyelashes turned out beautiful!  I used it with another eyelash kit! I haven&#x27;t tried the glue!</li>
    <li> The worst glue ever. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this over priced kit. The only good thing was the tweezers.</li>
    <li> I own a beauty shop and have been trying adhesives, one after the other.  This was the last one I was going to try before giving up.  Thankfully my husband talked me into buying it.  I put lashes on myself and others as a service in my shop.  I have tried Alluring ultra plus and max sensitive glues, plus an assortment of cheaper versions.  No one could tollerate the fumes from the ultra plus.  I tried mixing them to dilute the fumes, but this wasn&#x27;t much better.  Feedback from clients is heavy feeling eyes and missing lashes.  I have had anxiety when the phone rings because I am afraid their lashes didn&#x27;t hold. I have had to replace more than I should.  My own lashes, knowing all the rules, still wouldn&#x27;t hold.  I would spend hours trying to get them just right, and in the morning there would always be lashes missing.  I ordered the whole kit because it didn&#x27;t make sense to just buy the glue alone, when you got quite a bit of other needed products.  I have had the stays on glue on myself for a week now with no missing lashes.  They are lighter than the previous glues and knotted flares I have used.  I don&#x27;t realize I have them on most of the time.  This was not the case with the other products. I haven&#x27;t had any clients call with missing lashes either.  This is the first week I have used this product, but I&#x27;m very happy with it so far. I don&#x27;t review items I buy.  Never.  This is the first review I have done.  I think it is worth taking the time to do.  If it helps just one person avoid what I went through, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> My glue (which many said was great) doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all no matter what I try...</li>
    <li> It was alright...not too impressive.</li>
    <li> This glue is the worst!! It dries before you can even set the extension in place! The materials itself are average made in china-mart but bend when you separate them from the container. I got the dvd but no lint patches or lash press tool. I&#x27;m not sure why some people aren&#x27;t getting the kit as outlined? I regret purchasing this and would not recommend it. I don&#x27;t even know if I can return this so $130.00 down the drain. I read reviews prior to purchase but they were 50/50. Im glad I didnt have any clients I planned using this set on</li>
    <li> This kit is truly amazing, I would highly recommend it and you cant beat the price. I couldn&#x27;t live without it!!!!</li>
    <li> I thought the glue was going to b great nut it wasnt</li>
    <li> Super cute kit. There&#x27;s obviously a learning curve for those who are new to it. But there&#x27;s a lot of stuff included, guaranteed fun.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a few months ago and just moved to a new salon and spa and tried the product out on a friend.  Within 5 days her lashes were falling out from the glue not holding up.  I am very disappointed in the glue.  The kit itself is nice but the glue.....NO GOOD!!</li>
    <li> Glue sucks. Missing items described. No returns. Do not waste your money. I bought glue from another company and different lashes.</li>
    <li> This is a great value for everything you get. I do lashes in a salon and my clients love how long the glue holds up and it doesn&#x27;t have an awful oder and it isn&#x27;t heavy feeling. I recommend to my clients to buy this at home kit. You get well over $300 in product</li>
    <li> So I bought this set I think about two months ago, and I&#x27;m still using and still love it.  Everything is great quality, and it comes with everything that it says.  The eyelashes are awesome, and come in tones of different lengths which I love, and who doesn&#x27;t love the case?? Its adorable.  Anyways, I really do love this product and recommend it.  However, I don&#x27;t really like the glue.  Its not like it horrible... because it really isn&#x27;t. I just have used better before.  The glue just doesn&#x27;t seem to help the eyelashes last. Not to mention that there isn&#x27;t any sealant either, which is HUGE part of the lasting process of the eyelashes. But still, it really isn&#x27;t that bad.  I mean I still use the glue sometimes, especially because it doesn&#x27;t burn!  which my customers LOVE.  So reallly, buy this product. You wont regret it.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this kit for her work. She just tried them for a client and unfortunately she complained that the gel eye patches were not lint free as advertised. In fact when her client was done she had lint glued to the lashes and took her several minutes to clean them.</li>
    <li> Bulls*** want stay on because not human hair  .......bulls***¡!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just received my kit an item was cracked and it was missing some items. The lashes look really cheap. I have not used them yet.</li>
    <li> These lashes are great!!! My clients love them! Glue I haven&#x27;t tried &amp; CD gave my computer a virus!!! Don&#x27;t use it!!! Otherwise lashes and tools are Awesome!</li>
    <li> I purchased two different sets of these fun kits. This kit was the best of the two.  What a neat kit. has every thing you need and then some. Can&#x27;t wait to try them out but waiting for right occasion.  I will use these because I have lost most of my own lashes due to age and medications. So it will be nice to have lashes once again.</li>
    <li> did not come with instruction and the glue like was old. It would not stick on lashes. so with out instructions  I&#x27;m assuming its the glue. that is bad.</li>
    <li> You are really just paying for the glue, it is about $45-$50 itself, but you get the chance to try out different lash sizes and figure out what really works for you. I ended up loving the medium sized individual lashes, so I only bought those the next time I purchased and they are super inexpensive (less than $10 for a year&#x27;s supply of lashes). I think the glue is going to last me at least a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what you should know about me - like other reviewers, I used to go to a salon and pay $100 for a set that lasted about two weeks. The glue was so strong, I could not open my eyes while the asthetician put them on. This glue you can use YOURSELF, it has no odor and it does not burn, BUT the lashes only last a few days to a week.

Once you get the hang of this, you can add a few in the morning on your top lashes, it literally takes a few seconds to add a lash. I do not even use the tweezers, just my fingers. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves this item. I would recommend this one over others I reviewed.</li>
    <li> Im not happy with what a got, the description said that it was a kit with a instructional CD, there was no CD  in the pakage,also the bag had the mirror broken,and the solution for eyelashe removal doesn&#x27;t work very well.Idid like the lashes size and quality.</li>
    <li> I luv this item / I have sensitive eyes n can not handle other eyelashes glue but this glue company works well for me ; no redness or irritated very pleased n will order again soon and all the kit so far lasted me a long</li>
    <li> awesome kit! the best one i&#x27;ve used so far and easiest and cheapest i can find.</li>
