      <li>Its cheaply made.</li>
      <li>If you need a durable, cheap wig stand</li>
      <li>Looks flimsy &amp; cheap but does the job</li>
      <li>It is a bit light even with wig on it.  </li>
      <li>Great product  Much more sturdy than other \\&quot;portable\\&quot; plastic wig stands I have bought.  </li>
      <li>This product is a very good idea for a reasonable amount of money, but the material is very fragile.</li>

      <li>A part of it snapped when I tried to assemble it, but just a layer of duct tape fixed it up nicely.</li>

      <li>Their height is perfect and open construction allows the wigs to breath and dry</li>

      <li>and it&#x27;s useful in drying wigs when you wash them.</li>
      <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is they are very easy to tip over.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this as a way to block my knitted hats. It works ok. I still need to bunch up a few plastic bags at the top so it doesnt get a &amp;#34;ring&amp;#34; at the top...but, its fine for the price</li>
    <li> This stand works great, got it in a timely manner too. I will order through this vendor again in the future.</li>
    <li> Packaged well in plastic and sealed off. Love that this wig stand it is easy to assemble and collapse for travel. The frame fits my wig well and allows your wig to air out when you take it off. The only thing is the center circle at the top of the wig popped off and I lost it (but you don&#x27;t really need that part).</li>
    <li> Much better than foam heads, compact, and inexpensive. Perfect for dressing room tables backstage. I bought 6.  I am buying more.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s an ok item.  It&#x27;s a wig/hat stand.  I bought it to display hats that I make and sell.  Due to the slight flimsiness of the product and the fact that it&#x27;s got the four side jutting out, it&#x27;s not absolutely perfect for this purpose.  I&#x27;m sure as a wig stand it would work fine, though, or as something on which you simply store your hat.</li>
    <li> This was a present for someone who just started to wear wigs.  The Brittny Professional Salon Quality Wig Stand allows the wig to &#x27;dry out&#x27; after wearing it all day.</li>
    <li> If you need a durable, cheap wig stand this is perfect! It comes together and apart with ease for easy travelling and it&#x27;s useful in drying wigs when you wash them.</li>
    <li> My dad wanted me to find him a head to display a mask he bought in mexico.&lt;br /&gt;I used to work at a hat company and so i know a tad about heads :)&lt;br /&gt;this is much better than a styrofoam head because it is far more stable.&lt;br /&gt;we are not planning on collapsing it any point and maybe that would make the rating go down and I can see that with time it might get a little out of wack packing it and folding it over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly as stated, easy to put together and serving our needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> It does its job like it&#x27;s supposed to. I have a longer wig, and it was a little difficult to keep the stand upright at first, but it doesn&#x27;t fall over once it&#x27;s situated. As far as wig stands go, there isn&#x27;t really a reason not to choose this one.</li>
    <li> I received my wig stand in excellent condition packaged very well easy to put together I wish I had ordered 2 more  will purchase again great price!</li>
    <li> Hard to put together. Wigs fall over and stand falls over.  Skip this one.  It is a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> This wig stand is not portable as it was difficult to put together and difficult to take apart. You have to bend the plastic a little to get all the pieces into place and that&#x27;s when it breaks. The $4.00 shipping is really what annoyed my as the company was very nice giving me a refund but I will not get the shipping charges back. I will continue to look for a better quality stand. But silly me, what did I expect for $2.95  I will keep looking for a good quality wig stand.</li>
    <li> I have three, and the top ring snapped on each one when I assembled it. The whole thing is strong enough that this doesn&#x27;t really matter--it still works fine--but it doesn&#x27;t really speak well for the manufacturing quality.</li>
    <li> This product is a very good idea for a reasonable amount of money, but the material is very fragile. Handle with great care!  I&#x27;ll bet this stuff is made in China</li>
    <li> I purchased this item back in March 2011, thinking it was perfect since I travel a lot to different conventions. The moment I put it together at the hotel, the ring broke. Its cheaply made. Don&#x27;t waste your money on it like I did.</li>
    <li> This stand is excellent if it is stood in space that out of the way of traffic. It is a bit light even with wig on it.  But price is great! They are easy to assemble as I assembled 2 of them in less than 10 minutes without reading directions. Received with no damage to merchandise.</li>
    <li> This wig stand is so much better than a styrofoam wig head!  It is sturdy, but folds flat for travel.  The wig has great air circulation.  Also works good as a drying stand for turbans, scarves, etc. I got two, one for the wig, one for drying turban, scarves, caps.</li>
    <li> I used this to hold a Head &amp; Eye massager from Pure Therapy. It holds the multiple pound unit with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A bit hard to take apart after putting it together.&lt;br /&gt;- Looks flimsy &amp; cheap but does the job&lt;br /&gt;- Might be too tall for your typical hat, a smaller height would be better&lt;br /&gt;- for a few bucks, who cares. It does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> Great. Easy to put together, functionable.</li>
    <li> The stand is very sturdy and is made of high-quality plastic. I would recommend this to anyone who needs an inexpensive wig stand.</li>
    <li> This works for a tiny hairpiece or super short wig, but I don&#x27;t think it would work for anything substantial.  It is like a toy.  It falls over all the time.  It is a cheap alternative, but you get what you pay for.  I am forever picking it up after it falls over.</li>
    <li> This is sturdier than a lot of folding plastic wig stands. Also seems to be taller than the norm and can hold longer hair wigs without tipping.</li>
    <li> These hat stands are great!  Besides being affordable, they&#x27;re sturdy, light and will support a heavily-decorated top hat.  The ability to fold and store them flat is fab.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Has a nice shape and does not catch on the wigs.</li>
    <li> EASY to assemble. Not the most sturdy, but perfect for the price. Strongly recommend especially for the price! Has a perfect shape to allow the wig to keep it&#x27;s shape and small enough to not stretch out the elastic.</li>
    <li> The stand is easy to snap in place and I can pack and carry it for a con. It also holds the shape of the wig well. Styling on it is harder, though it can be done.</li>
    <li> Unit is inexpensive, assembles easily, and folds compactly.  Lets the wig air out much better than plastic foam wig stands.</li>
    <li> Difficult to assemble (not conceptually, but the material is not sturdy). The stand is made of inexpensive plastic and not what I would think of as &#x27;professional&#x27;. I would, however, but this product again. It serves the purpose for which it was intended.</li>
    <li> This is terrible  .The top part comes off every single time. I literally hate it.  Need a new one.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of costume wigs and this one only works for the short, light wigs. Do not use for long, heavy wigs. It tips over a lot.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as described and I received it on time :) My mother in law loves it and can ow rid her ugly discolored Styrofoam ones!</li>
    <li> I received the stand rather quickly and although it was a bit over packaged, it worked nicely.    A part of it snapped when I tried to assemble it, but just a layer of duct tape fixed it up nicely. I guess it works well if you are gonna travel, but I would suggest buying a couple in case it snaps and you don&#x27;t have any duct tape.    I have my costuming wig on it now and it works quite nicely. I would have given it 5 stars, except that it is too easily snapped and a bit of a pain to assemble.</li>
    <li> made of sturdy hard plastic, this wig stand clicks together and stays together until you wish to take it apart. taken apart, it folds together compactly. good size. good value. very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It was a little hard to figure out to assemble, but it is very light and simple.  I love it!</li>
    <li> did not like when i put it together one side was higher than the other.do not buy</li>
    <li> Great product  Much more sturdy than other \\&quot;portable\\&quot; plastic wig stands I have bought.  A snap to put together.  Fantastic value for the price.  Will be buying more!</li>
    <li> Got it today whorls great</li>
    <li> Is a good product for the price. I reccomend  and I may order more too :-)</li>
    <li> What a wonderful purchase. I&#x27;ve been a puppeteer for over 30 years, The figures I work with are life sized - the most popular one goes by the name of \\&quot;Big Momma\\&quot;. The wigs are made by a designer and stored on a shelving system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found even the weighted Styrofoam foam heads problematic as they tip over and are cumbersome to travel with. The professional \\&quot;saw dust\\&quot; filled wig heads are far to expensive at around $50 apiece and weren&#x27;t a suitable option for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While poking around Amazon I came across these and decided to give them a try - I&#x27;m more than happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased 10 of these. They&#x27;re made of strong plastic and assemble in a few seconds. Their height is perfect and open construction allows the wigs to breath and dry if they&#x27;ve been washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus they make organization much easier. The price can&#x27;t be beat as each stand was only $5.18 Plus with my Prime membership this was yet one more order that was eligible for free 2 day shipping so they arrived lightening fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each stand is unassembled and arrived in it&#x27;s sealed retail packaging. The stands were shipped well protected in a heavy box. These are Simply an excellent purchase</li>
    <li> I love this for my wigs. It does not take up too much room. Great priduct and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I like it &#x27;cause I can hide it anywhere; it&#x27;s not bulky! It&#x27;s also simple and quick to assemble and it even comes with an instruction set just in case. Nice purchase for a good price.</li>
    <li> It works, and is easy to use. If you&#x27;re looking for those two things, then look no further. You have arrived.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a sturdy little thing.  I think it would be ideal when I travel.  Would recommend, just be careful when putting it together.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, easy to assemble, and sturdy - they work very well for storing my wigs and allowing air circulation throughout the cap when not being worn.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> I was surprised and the sturdiness of this stand.  It even stands on carpet!  Very good value for the price.</li>
    <li> These are great for cap and hat display but not for larger size hats.  The only complaint I have is they tip over easily so I recommend putting velcro on the display table. Also the top ring does not fit on some of them so that can be a bit frustrating but the concept and idea if you can do a little work on your stand is a great display item to use.</li>
    <li> This product is cheap in quality, but you get what you pay for and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I currently have a wig sitting on it and it is working just fine. Mine doesn&#x27;t sit flat on a surface (with all four legs) but it is stable enough to hold the wig up.</li>
    <li> The top piece does not snap into place, and the bottom two did not line up completely so the stand does wobble a little. I am using this for a 28 in long wig, and it hasn&#x27;t fallen yet, so I am hopeful.</li>
    <li> This was easy to put together and hold my big fur hat very well. It&#x27;s for wigs but works great for hats. I didn&#x27;t like the hat stands I saw. This works much better for the style of hat I have.</li>
    <li> These items are exactly as advertised.  They are flexible, brittle plastic that can be bent into shape. But they are low priced so how much can you expect.  I have no problems with them because I needed a cheap, lightweight, portable display. If you are planning to use these outdoors be prepared to keep picking them up off the ground. I shove them into a piece of Styrofoam and then cover it with fabric. Looks cute! And I don&#x27;t think they could take the weigh of a wig (I use them for hat stands). Overall I&#x27;m happy with them although I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll last very long. But, like I said, they are low priced and a good item for my needs.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I purchased</li>
    <li> i wold recomend a foam head i like the stand but i comes appart very easily and the gets frusterating when trying to style the hair.</li>
    <li> Product was okay but a little flimsy. Like a puzzle trying to put it together. I prefer the foam head for the wigs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nothing great.  It does the job.  It&#x27;s a piece of plastic that keeps shape to my hats.  It&#x27;s collapsible so it&#x27;ll be good if I need it for traveling.</li>
    <li> strong enough for aluminum chain mail.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble and meets my needs.</li>
    <li> light weight and flimsy, falls over easy</li>
    <li> I really like how simple this is, I don&#x27;t have any heads lying around in my room anymore(: It was very simpe to put together. I do use a lot of longer, heavy wings on them and they seem to hold up. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is they are very easy to tip over. I would barely touch the wig on it and they would fall over.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made but good for the price</li>
    <li> Great wig stand. It stands taller than most and goes together in a snap.  wigs dry in half iin the time I think because there is so much room between the diviiders.  Very impressed.</li>
