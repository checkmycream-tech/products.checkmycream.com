      <li>i love this perfume!</li>
      <li>for me I&#x27;m out of the United States has been one effective solution.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I tend to avoid overpowering perfumes so this one was perfect for me and my sensitive nose.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments on this (from women and men) -</li>
      <li>perfume smells like warm fruity taffy and it&#x27;s quite light (and doesn&#x27;t trigger my sneezing like most perfumes</li>

      <li>It seemed to be a better value than in the department stores too.</li>
      <li>My favorite fragrance EVER.</li>
      <li>but when it settles on your skin it leaves a nice sweet fruity scent which I love.</li>
      <li>When I first smelled this scent, I loved it.</li>
      <li>For me - this smells like a clean sexy dessert.</li>
      <li>and is in a very convenient presentation now i can carry with me all the time &#x3D;), and is so sweet!</li>

      <li>this fragrance is really sweet and the scent reminds me of a vanilla cake,</li>
      <li>I love the perfume and it got to me fast</li>
      <li>It has a light, fresh smell so it is not over powering.  </li>
      <li>The Fancy Nights version of this scent is much better and lasts much longer.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m almost embarrassed to admit that this is most likely my favorite fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The order came so fast!!</li>
      <li>This perfume smells very nice and lasts longer than previous  fragrances that I have bounty  from Jessica Simpson .THe</li>
      <li>Light, mysterious and sexy.</li>

      <li>This perfume is much cheaper than what I paid for it.</li>
      <li>I do not notice it much because I am used to it.</li>
      <li>and I have to say I really like it &#x3D;3</li>
      <li>This is my second bottle of Jessica&#x27;s original parfum..</li>
      <li>I loved this product but was surprised after I received it in the mail that it was the very small size.</li>
      <li>Other than that everything else was fine.</li>
      <li>It came as a new product would</li>
      <li>Next time I order I have to read a little more.</li>
      <li>(I am a 39-year-old professional).</li>
      <li>not too strong, not too weak, have had a lot of compliments on the fragrance, really like it a lot.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately it is getting harder to find but this a great price on it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t seem to figure out what exactly this smells like,lol, it sprays out a little overpowering</li>

<li> It also last a long time!</li>
<li> people may say it doesn&#x27;t last long, but the scent lasted quite a long while on me.</li>
<li> I could still smell the soft undertones after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Not my favorite scent - disappointed and giving away.</li>
<li> I had bought a small travel size at walmart since I wanted to try this fragrance out before buying a larger bottle</li>

<li> Complements everyday.</li>
<li> I must have went through 3 high-end department stores and 2 drug stores trying on fragrances the past few weeks - and</li>
<li> and people sat closer to me then usual</li>
<li> I mean everyone.</li>
<li> Just a subtle pleasantry throughout the day.</li>
<li> Notes of this perfume are:top, apricot, pear and red berries;middle, jasmine, gardenia, caramel and almond; base, vanilla, amber and sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;These notes work well with my skin chemistry.</li>
<li> I was so disappointed.</li>
<li> Horrible I wish they would return my money.  </li>
<li> smells terrible like a bug spray</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> not too strong, not too weak, have had a lot of compliments on the fragrance, really like it a lot.</li>
    <li> When I first smelled this scent, I loved it. Light, mysterious and sexy. I thought I had found my signature scent. But about an hour after applying, the scent was gone. I was so disappointed. Even layering it with body wash and lotion, it only last maybe 3 hours. The Fancy Nights version of this scent is much better and lasts much longer.</li>
    <li> Some of my co-workers and friends were surprised I have a Jessica Simpson fragrance as my signature scent for the past year (I am a 39-year-old professional). For Christmas my hubby and kids gave me the \\&quot;gift of any fragrance\\&quot; Anything I want! With my cash in hand I was determined to find a \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; replacement for my Fancy scent. I must have went through 3 high-end department stores and 2 drug stores trying on fragrances the past few weeks - and well........ I just placed my reorder here to buy the Jessica Simpson Fancy gift set because AMAZON has the BEST prices anywhere.  How does it smell?? Well with any fragrance - how it smells is a very individual experience. For me - this smells like a clean sexy dessert. Sorry, but those are the best adjectives I can think of. I get so many compliments on this (from women and men) - yet it is not overpowering. Just a subtle pleasantry throughout the day. I do not notice it much because I am used to it. I loved Jessica&#x27;s lip glosses when she came out with those years ago - and I tried this and have been faithful since. Thank you Ms. Simpson!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost embarrassed to admit that this is most likely my favorite fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfume smells like warm fruity taffy and it&#x27;s quite light (and doesn&#x27;t trigger my sneezing like most perfumes do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may say it doesn&#x27;t last long, but the scent lasted quite a long while on me. I could still smell the soft undertones after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to avoid overpowering perfumes so this one was perfect for me and my sensitive nose. It smells so yummy.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance EVER. Unfortunately it is getting harder to find but this a great price on it. Delivered promptly and in tack.</li>
    <li> I had bought a small travel size at walmart since I wanted to try this fragrance out before buying a larger bottle and I have to say I really like it &#x3D;3 this fragrance is really sweet and the scent reminds me of a vanilla cake, when I spritzed my neck and wrists while I was at at work, a friend of mine who was sitting across the table from me said I was \\&quot;making her hungry\\&quot; x&#x27;D and people sat closer to me then usual and I couldn&#x27;t even stop sniffing my wrists, it just smells to good    overall this scent is very enjoyable if you like the smell of sweet treats, something fancy and sophisticated.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite scent - disappointed and giving away.</li>
    <li> I loved this product but was surprised after I received it in the mail that it was the very small size. But I should have known for the price. Next time I order I have to read a little more. Other than that everything else was fine.</li>
    <li> smells terrible like a bug spray</li>
    <li> smells  great, i love this perfume, great staying power. not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love the perfume and it got to me fast i will be buying a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> Notes of this perfume are:top, apricot, pear and red berries;middle, jasmine, gardenia, caramel and almond; base, vanilla, amber and sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;These notes work well with my skin chemistry. I especially smell the caramel and almond. Sillage and longevity are quite good. This is a wonderful fragrance, and I don &#x27;t let age,looks or the opinions of others deter me from wearing a scent that I love.&lt;br /&gt;This has a few notes similar to Charlie Gold, but is softer, without the spice notes.</li>
    <li> I was extrememly happy with my purchase and I will reorder again. It came as a new product would and I was well please of the condition that I received it.</li>
    <li> Smells so good.  Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I had someone follow me to ask what I was wearing.  Smells great and lasts a long while. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> The order came so fast!! I was amazed, I got the urge to buy it because its all my best friend wears! It smells so good and comes in a beautiful package! It also last a long time! I while heartedly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> i love this perfume! and is in a very convenient presentation now i can carry with me all the time &#x3D;), and is so sweet!</li>
    <li> This order was somehow deceptive.  We thought we were getting 1.7 ounces of perfume, but somehow it got changed in the ordering process to 1.0 ounce of perfume.  Since it is labeled as a HazMat according to Amazon.com,  we cannot return it, but we will never get perfume from Amazon again.  This should have been 1.7 ounces.  The only reason I gave it a five star rating is because of Jessica Simpson.</li>
    <li> This perfume is much cheaper than what I paid for it. Even one loves how I smell when I spray this on. I mean everyone. And the scent last as long time. Complements everyday.</li>
    <li> Horrible I wish they would return my money.  Smells like alcohol nit perfume. The little sweetness it has is overpowered by the alcohol .  This  product is bogus.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells very nice and lasts longer than previous  fragrances that I have bounty  from Jessica Simpson .THe fragrance still does have to be reapplied more than once during the day.</li>
    <li> It has a light, fresh smell so it is not over powering.  It seemed to be a better value than in the department stores too.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly..however didn&#x27;t like smell...smells weird sweet like caramel but also like medicine, like burned sugar...not for me</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Jessica&#x27;s original parfum.. It smells luscious and really lasts! The bottle is gorgeous too. I highly recommend to anyone who loves vanilla based parfums and wants a true girly scent to add to your fragrance collection.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to figure out what exactly this smells like,lol, it sprays out a little overpowering but when it settles on your skin it leaves a nice sweet fruity scent which I love.</li>
    <li> wonderful ... 100% efficiency. speed and security. for me I&#x27;m out of the United States has been one effective solution.</li>
    <li> beautiful smelling , my favorite!</li>
