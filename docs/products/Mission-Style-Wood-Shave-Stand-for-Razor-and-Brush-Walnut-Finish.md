<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It works great, the staining job could have been a little better but other than that I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Nice quality stand for my brush and razor.</li>
    <li> SUPER NICE STAND FOR THE PRICE. SHOULD LAST A VERY LONG TIME WITH CARE. FINISH IS EXCEPTIONALLY NICE ON THE PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I’ve had the stand for just about a year with no issues. The stand holds my Parker Best Badger shaving brush and my DE Gillette like a champ!</li>
    <li> The finish and the color of the stand are good. The wood isn&#x27;t of the best quality but you wouldn&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush fit-&lt;br /&gt;I have two shaving brushes, Tweezerman badger brush and Esacali badger hair brush. It holds my Tweezerman shaving brush well but my Escali shaving brush won&#x27;t fit in. A good brush holder and 100% functional.&lt;br /&gt;Razor fit-&lt;br /&gt;I have a merkur long handle Saftey Razor [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] that sits ok vertically on the back and horizontally on the top. I however can&#x27;t figure out how to secure my Merkur safety razor in either position. It holds the razor but isn&#x27;t secured like the brush. The brush won&#x27;t fall but the razor will if you push the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict-&lt;br /&gt;It is costly from a functional aspect. However, when guests look at it in my bathroom it does look good. It is more of a showpiece than it is functional. I would recommend this all vintage loving romantics who don&#x27;t mind compromising a little of functionality for the looks.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son.  It&#x27;s very nice...looks great and good quality.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This was great for classing up my bathroom a bit. Better than just having my razor and brush just laying out/around.    It just so happened that this fit perfectly in my medicine cabinet. My new place doesn&#x27;t have much counter space so it worked out great. The only drawback is that nobody will see it in there, except of course for the snoopers.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves it! It holds his razor and brush very well. As far as aesthetics, the stand looks exactly like it does in the picture. It has a walnut finish, not chestnut, in case you want a dark brown color. Nonetheless, the stand is still a warm brown and has a nice wood grain effect. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> very nice, color was a lot lighter than shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> Beautiful piece of art but not as functional as I would like. My brush does not fit through the smallest point of the holder. I had to take a Dremel and widen the point of entry; until I can stain it, it looks weird. It should be noted that not all safety razors will fit across the horizontal top groove and that the back has a vertical groove for those shaving with disposable razors. Mission Style, to me, implies functionality first. (A Stickley chair is not great art but it is built like a tank and will last over 100 years) If you buy this, realize it may not fit your safety razor handle diameter. Realize it may not accommodate your brush handle. Be ready to tinker with it to &amp;#34;make it your own&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This item fits the brush I own well,  initially I could not get the brush to fit,  although it ended us being my mistake.  The safety razor I use regularly [[ASIN:B0017QSZY4 Parker 22R Double Edge Butterfly Safety Razor and 10 Blades]] doesn&#x27;t fit well, it is a bit wobbly in there, although I find it is no problem to fit if placed in and slid against the wall.  I imagine it may work well for other razors. I purchased this as it beautifully matches my soap bowl [[ASIN:B00161BEO8 Kingsley Shave Soap Bowl with Lid Dark Wood]] which looks great sitting in front of it for storage, taking up a small amount of real estate in my limited area. Not a bad product at all.</li>
    <li> I does not fit Escali brushes as it has a smaller diameter opening but is a very well made holder. It is not quite this dark in real-life.</li>
    <li> This Stand looks better in person. The one issue is that it will only fit the thinner brushes. This is unfortunate, however, a new brush is not always a bad idea. This works well as a Straight Razor stand also. My Dovo rests nicely in the top groove and is complemented by a similay colored shave soap bowl. An excellent deal overall.</li>
    <li> It looks like it&#x27;s solid quality in the picture but as others have stated here the stain/finish is really low quality.  It \\&quot;looks\\&quot; nice but after a short time of small drops of water dripping onto it the stain will begin to come off and then the wood underneath begins to look nasty.    Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not fancy, but it does the job.  it holds my brush (a Shavemac 177) and a razor on top.  The top groove could be a bit wider as could the brush opening.  But for the price, it&#x27;s a great stand, sturdy and it does the job.</li>
    <li> My first reaction to this stand when I open the package was - wow this thing is TINY. Yes I know the the spec&#x27;s state its size but I was still taken aback, at first. The next thing that struck me was the brush I had purchased did not fit, I was disappointed and and not looking forward to re-sizing the opening. Well, I figured out that brush knot goes in the holder with the bristles pointing down, not the handle, which rides above the opening. Now this little stand is starting to make sense. My de razor had a horn handle that does not fit in the groove on top, but I found that if I turn the head so it rides vertically then it balances quite well. So after messing around with this stand for about 20 minutes I went from 2 stars ( in my head, mind you )to my current 5 stars.       It looks great on one side of the vanity and a matching wood shave soap bowl on the other completes the look. I didn&#x27;t want a metal chrome or polished brass stand as I think they look too gaudy, though I&#x27;m sure they function well, and the wood just kind of makes a nice counterpoint to the metal of the brush handle and razor head. Subtle and classy. Another reviewer mentioned the finish looking like cheap varnish, I would say the stand that I received does have a little gloss to it in places but where this is in an area that gets wet daily I like the protection of varnish.      I am new to DE wet shaving so I am withholding reviews on my other shaving equipment until they have some miles on them. This stand however hasn&#x27;t nicked my face once and it looks great !!</li>
    <li> The arms are too close together to hold my brush by the handle as my chrome stand does and so i have the handle above the arms. More problematic is that the space in the back is too small for the safety razor- it fits my old gillette sensor cartridge razor perfectly but the safety razor is simply too big to fit properly. it balances if i hang it correctly but if i rock the stand back and forth/dont align it perfectly it will fall off. I am considering altering the stand to hold the razor better but I really shouldn&#x27;t have to. The only plus this stand gets is that the wood is beautiful and it looks great with my wooden shave bowl (although it doesnt perfectly match the mango wood bowl amazon sells it&#x27;s close enough in my opinion)    EDIT: Revising from 1 to 4 star based on response indicating the proper way to place a safety razor on this stand. Additionally, using a dremel to deepen the channel in the back helps the razor stay much more securely (hanging)</li>
    <li> This product would be great, but the brush I have does not fit on it. So I will have to adapt it a bit with a file. Not worth the trouble to return and try something else. Also I do like the look of the wood and design as it goes well in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Maybe the manufacturer is reading the reviews... I was cautious about what to expect when I ordered this, having read the reviews about finish and quality.  I ordered it anyway since it best matched what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived and felt heavy for its size -- it&#x27;s substantial, heavy wood.  The wood quality and grain are really nice and the finish is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functionally, it does what you expect. My sensor razor does prop up vertically on the back, which I like for saving space but as others note anything that doesn&#x27;t fit along the back can lie flat across the top of the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on what I received, I would highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Looks good and stylish. Option to hang razor 2 ways is cool. A bit snug for the brush, but still good. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this great stand to hold my brush and found out that it also holds my razor at the top! it is great! i love this thing and it looks so nice anf fancy anywhere it is sitting because of the wood it is made from!</li>
    <li> It holds my razor, it holds my brush, it&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s dourable. What more can I ask for?</li>
    <li> I bought this item hoping it would have decent workmanship. Unfortunately, the stain and finish were uneven and only fits smaller shave brushes (around 19mm sized knot). It felt and looked pretty cheap. I ended up returning it. I replaced it with a chrome Omega brush stand for smaller brushes, also purchased from amazon. The chrome brush stand from Omega is a much better product, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Fits the tweezerman bagerhair brush perfectly as well as having a place to hold my razor. Using a stand is very impotant because you have to be able to dry the brush with the bristles down. If you are drying your brush by placing is on the counter with the handle down, you are holding the water against your handle which leads to your bristles falling out.</li>
    <li> When this stand gets wet, the wood stain seeps out and leaves stains on your sink counter. The razor holder does not accomodate all razor types, I tried to hang my Gillette Fusion and did not fit.</li>
    <li> Nice little stand, I wish the brush holder was a little wider - it&#x27;s a little hard on my brushes as it squeezes them tightly and lets face it, a good brush is worth 10 times what this is.  The holder for the razor could be a little bigger too - unless you&#x27;re using a thin handled razor, it doesn&#x27;t really fit.  I have a merkur long classic that fits on it as long as I don&#x27;t move the stand it won&#x27;t fall off, but my Futur definitely doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> This stand is wonderful. I have been using it for over a year now. I try and get good use out of something like this before I review the product. The wood itself isn&#x27;t heavy and I assume it it is a veneer or just a stained cheaper wood. The stand holds my art of shaving brush perfectly and the lip for the razor is perfect for any style razor. This particular item is not over complicated as many stands can be with the different widths used among razors. For those dabbling into the search for the perfect shave this is a wonderful product to start with because it is just the stand and will fit all razors and most brushes. Enjoy gentlemen because dragging razor sharp blades across your face is by far one of the manliest thing you can do.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an xmas gift for hubby. He loved it. It holds his brush and safety razor very nicely, and is sturdy so it doesn&#x27;t tip over. We have a narrow bathroom medicine cabinet and it does fit. True to picture. Although his razor is not made exactly for this stand it works just fine and is pretty universal.</li>
    <li> This product is beautiful to look at, but was dissapointed when the brush did not fit into the holder.  My husband is going to try to cut away at the wood to make it work, rather than deal with the return shipping.</li>
    <li> I bought the generic steel stand that everyone starts with for my merkur and while it was heavy and well built it looked cheap. I stumbled across this wooden alternative on amazon and had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wont scratch the finish on razors (especially anodized offerings such as standard razor in black / gunmetal)&lt;br /&gt;solidly constructed&lt;br /&gt;multiple mounting options for both DE and disposable offerings&lt;br /&gt;Wood looks nicer than steel alternatives&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush holder is narrow, its hard to fit omega brushed in without pinching the bristles&lt;br /&gt;Feels lightweight compared to steel offerings (But I havent knocked it over yet</li>
    <li> love this stand the wood is pretty and it fits razor and brush perfectly. made very sturdy highly recommend this item if you want something besides the metal ones</li>
    <li> Works well with brush and razor, which I lay in the groove along the top edge.  Brush groove is a little tight for the brush but still useable.</li>
    <li> looks good and works great still looking good from being used aver day not much more to say it does the job and go well with my bathroom and hold up to a lot of use</li>
    <li> I figured since I was buying a new brush and razor I needed a stand.  I&#x27;m sure the various metal stands would have worked also, but this stand just looks so classy and holds everything so well.  Again, if you&#x27;re looking for a stand, I&#x27;m sure the others will work out just fine, but this one looks the best in my opinion.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted the typical cheap plastic brush stand thinking the wood would suffer from water. I liked this one and decided to give it a try. Wonderful. Wood is treated, shows no wear after months. And the stand is attractive. Looks great. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is nicely made, looks great &amp; very handy to keep the bathroom counter neat &amp; uncluttered. Great for air drying shaving brush &amp; razor.</li>
    <li> Once I figured out that the brush is supposed to slide in where the knot meets the handle (not on the handle itself), I really liked this little stand. It looks good, but don&#x27;t expect master-craftsman level of finishing. It&#x27;s a little on the rough-cut side, though no unduly sharp edges, and no splinters. Just keep in mind what this costs, and you&#x27;ll realize that it&#x27;s durn good value for money, even though it&#x27;s far from perfectly finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple years&#x27; use, it&#x27;s still going strong. I have no complaints at all about this little stand.</li>
    <li> This is a great item for any shaving brush.. I highly recommend this item!!</li>
    <li> This razor and brush stand is nicer that I expected. It is constructed well and has a quality finish. It was a little smaller than I anticipated and it fits neatly on the countertop near my sink.</li>
    <li> The finish is glossier than the pics show. Nice piece of wood, nicely put together. It keeps my things together and I anticipate it will do so for years. The neutral color will fit in with most bathroom decor, and the old styling is a great match with vintage wet shaving items. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with one reviewer who said this looks like something made in a high school shop class.    The one I got had rough spots where the brush goes in and a section of wood that looks like the finish had been sanded down to remove a rough spot.  The general finish looks like some cheap shiny polyurethane finish on it.  This goes along with most high school shop workers, they like using the power tools, putting a piece together, but tend to not put much effort into the finish of the product.. Sanding is too much manual work and they tend to use the fastest and easiest finish available to them (or the school provides the cheapest and fastest drying product).    I&#x27;m going to see if I can strip the crappy finish off of this otherwise solid and useful product, smooth up the rough spots (that would otherwise damage a brush in short order) and apply a nice hand rubbed oil finish to bring the finish up to a decent standard.    Would be nice if there were an \\&quot;unfinished\\&quot; option available, so one could save the time and trouble of cleaning up the messy finish first!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these holding my Tweezerman shaving brush for years now, and it&#x27;s still going strong. I&#x27;ll need to replace it soon as I should&#x27;ve put a coat of sealant on the stand when I got. It&#x27;s got some water damage on it now, but considering it lives in my shower and holds both my razor and brush, that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get one. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I Like the way it looks but I cannot use it for my razor (Gilette Fusion).</li>
    <li> At first I was disappointed that my Edwin Jagger double edge razor didn&#x27;t fit vertically on this stand. Then I figured out that I can store it horizontally. Ah! Perfect! It doesn&#x27;t really hold my shaving brush the right way because the handle on my cheap brush is too big. It does hold the brush however, I have to fit it on the bristles against the handle. Not on the handle where I would like. No matter, I&#x27;m going to buy a nicer brush anyway and think it&#x27;ll be able to fit properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand looks nice on my bathroom sink. Fancy.</li>
    <li> Well-designed brush holder.  A horizontal groove along the top and vertically down the back allows you to hand your razor and/or lay the razor across the top.  I wish the thing was really made of walnut - not sure what material is used, but it is very lightweight (actually too much so) and the finish is just painted on.  Still, for the price, a nice solution.</li>
    <li> I have this holder paired with a Colonel Conk Santa Fe shave cup and a simply beutiful badger hair shave brush.  The whole set looks awesome.  I just got into &amp;#34;old School&amp;#34; shaving about 2 months ago, and I love this setup.  It looks classy and works perfectly for what I needed.  The razor can be laid across the top or hung vertially off the back.  They have grooves in the top to support your razor in eaither direction.  With the brush hanging in the holder I have about 1/2 - 3/4&amp;#34; between the bottom of the hairs and the wood, so everything dries out quickly.</li>
    <li> It has a nice solid look and feel.  It keeps my shaving tools neat and out of the way. My wife likes it too.</li>
    <li> This is a great stand for more \\&quot;modern\\&quot; razors.  Unfortunately, I use a Parker 91R Super Heavyweight and the razor barely hangs on to the back of the stand.  If you own and use an old school safety razor, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> This stand is very nice. The finish is good, not perfect mind you but it&#x27;s quite acceptable for the price.&lt;br /&gt;It will hold any razor, and will hold most brushes, as long as the knot isn&#x27;t greater than 1 inch in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;Just a heads up, this stand is designed to hold brushes down by the knot, not by the handle.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews, and chose to buy. I could not be more pleased! The grain of wood, its colour and quality of the construction greatly exceeded my expectations. One of my better buys on Amazon. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Looks great in my bathroom. Holds my brush and safety razor. My wife likes how it looks on the counter.</li>
    <li> This stand is a convenient way to hold your shaving items, it&#x27;s a nice looking piece  and does what it should!</li>
    <li> The stand looks great exactly as expected.  Biggest drawback is that it does not hold my Escali shaving brush in the proper way.  You have to slide it in at the level of the bristles rather than on the contour of the handle.  It does not fit in the way most people would want to hang the brush.  I&#x27;d say, this stand is worth about $12-13 considering its limitations.  Even if my particular shaving brush did fit, the badger hair would be pushing against the wood and causing it to bend.</li>
    <li> This shaving brush and razor stand works great, no problems. Some brushes may be a squeeze to put on stand, but they vary greatly so this should be expected. Overall great finish, form and function!</li>
    <li> I not only fit my badger brush &amp; DE Parker, but there was also a notch in the back to hold my toothbrush.  This was a surprise they failed to mention.  Good quality also.</li>
    <li> The stand works as advertised, just large enough to hold either cartridge or safety razor and a brush.  Doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on a bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> This brush and razor stand if very lovely.  The wood and finish are beautiful--much better than I expected.</li>
    <li> Much more attractive than the cheap looking metal stands. Looks great with my antique gold Gillette Tech razor. Craftsmanship appears solid and I haven&#x27;t experienced any seeping of the wood stain as mentioned in previous reviews. It helps to shake your brush out before hanging it.</li>
    <li> Stylish, looks good with the ceramic bowl and wood handled boar I bought to go along with it.  Real wood not veneer or silver plated like my last one so should last for a long time.</li>
    <li> Good wood and quality of construction.  Holds a safety razor and badger brush very well.  Easy to remove and replace the brush on stand.</li>
    <li> Water drips down off of brush and removes the finish on the wood. It starts to look shabby pretty quickly. Maybe you could dunk it in some sort of water proofing stuff. But that&#x27;s more work than I wanted to do.</li>
    <li> Very nice looking stand. It is so nice looking it only hang dry brushes from it. Not recommended by me for actually drying.</li>
    <li> In case you do not want a metal stand, as many of them are these days, this is one of the few wooden stands available. It is not big by any means, and so far so good, not warping in a damp hot shower. Looks good overall.</li>
    <li> Just like photo and looks great!</li>
    <li> Shave stand works well, and exactly as it should. Great deal for the stand overall! No complaints and fast shipping!Looks great sitting on the sink, to show everything off.</li>
    <li> Nice finish does not fit every type of razor. Swapped with my son and it works for his razor. Good</li>
    <li> Love the look and functionality</li>
    <li> Not bad. Could have been sanded more before it was stained. Does not fit the Taylor of Old Bond Street badger brush, so I&#x27;ll be sending it back.</li>
    <li> Holds my shave brush and my DE blade rests sideways in the groove across the top.  It&#x27;ll hold a standard razor too: the head/cartridge rests in the top groove and the handle hangs down the back.  Nice enough to leave out on the bathroom counter for sure.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my brush. Or any other brush I have owned. Great idea, terrible design.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an affordable razor and brush stand for a little over a year.  I was very excited when I saw the price and read the reviews for this one.  I have been very pleased with the color, quality and size of the product.  My only issue is that the brush holder opening is WAY too big for my brush.  I purchased an &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; starter pack that comes with a brush with a rather small handle.  There is no way my brush would fit into this.  Consequently this is pretty much unsuable and doesn&#x27;t do much more than sit and look pretty next to my sink.</li>
    <li> Sure looks great...a fine addition to my shave den.</li>
    <li> this stand is nice and does not take up space in the bathroom sink. it holds my badger hair brush and my parker butterfly razor nice and neatly. they wood has an attractive finish to it that does not come of if it gets wet. i have had this for over a year and there is no sign of fading. the only issue i had if it really can be called that was that it was a bit smaller than what i had expected, but like i mentioned earlier it does hold my shaving items neatly and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Did not fit my wood handle brush, the opwning is small. It might be fine for others.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shaving brush stand for the price. I place a Merkur safety razor across the top, which fits nicely.&lt;br /&gt;After time the finish will probable wear some, but for the price I will just re-varnish it.</li>
    <li> Looks great in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Love it. Good color, Sturdy and Holds several types of razors and it stores brush perfectly. A must have for the wet shaver.</li>
    <li> Good stand.  I like that I can store both my shaving brush and my double edged razor on the stand.  The stand is too fragile to travel with, but it&#x27;s not designed for travel.</li>
    <li> I hang my brush on this and perch it on the edge of the sink to drain. The razor handle goes on the top. Not sure what else to say. Simple, attractive, and functional. Works for me!</li>
    <li> Very functional, and I love the styling. The issue I have is that the finish is not waterproof(!) and is leaching slowly onto the side of my bathroom sink. I plan on sealing this with a waterproofing agent - something I will do from the start if I ever order another one. Overall, I like the product enough to order it again, as long as the price remains below $20, but the need to seal it after arrival means I&#x27;ll probably just build something similar myself next time.</li>
    <li> The quality is nice but the brush falls out. I gave up trying to make it work.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what these other reviewers are talking about, or if possibly they somehow received a different product, but this thing is HORRIBLE. On the picture it looks like a nice quality product with a dark matte finish. The one I received looks cheap and has a lighter, uneven and shiny finish. Just so bad, it looks like someone made it in shop class.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item with [[ASIN:B002DHQUTS Genuine Dark Mango Wood Shaving Soap Bowl - High Lustre Finish]] and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The match is good, although not perfect, but the class they add to my shaving sink is unbeatable.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with soap and a brush for a while, and recently switched to my grandfather&#x27;s single blade safety razor when I decided the old fashion shave was the way for me.  My brush hangs perfectly from the hook, and the razor rests along the opposite side of the stand.  I have had no issues with the finish of the stand, with none of the water spotting I expected from a wood product.</li>
    <li> This is a very nicely made, quality stand. It holds my boyfriend&#x27;s Escali shave brush without the bristles touching the base and his long handled Merkur safety razor fits perfectly across the top so that any water doesn&#x27;t sit in the head of the razor under the blade. We are very happy with this purchase and it works wonderfully. The dark wood finish is quite attractive and this stand is very sturdy. When I bought this I felt like it would be a better choice over the stands that hold the razor by the head. It may be all in my head but I feel like in the long run, storing the razor on its side with the head upright will result in a longer life for the razor. I have seen some pictures on here of the Merkur razors with the rusted out middle prong and I got scared that water sitting under the blade when the razor is vertically stored may be the culprit. Of course I might just be crazy! Overall this stand is a great, functional product and well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Good quality, but doesn&#x27;t fit the brush well.</li>
    <li> I got this as an intro kit to wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat expensive, but it looks nice with my wooden bowl.&lt;br /&gt;Holds my tweezerman shaving brush and my Merkur 180 long safety razor</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have any idea how many brush holders there were &#x27;til I asked on the web.  Shopped and finally decided that price was the key to the decision.  I did want something with a fairly large base to avoid tipping over.  Also needed a place to balance the razor. Liked this wood model after seeing illustrations of it with the brush and razor in place. With a smooth back it would fit in the medicine cabinet shelf or on my counter top.  Chose the counter top &#x27;cause I want to show it off.&lt;br /&gt;I did make a small modification to the design after I had used it for a few times. I put some little plastic feet under each corner to keep it from holding moisture underneath.</li>
    <li> This thing is great. It&#x27;s very sturdy build and looks great on the counter top. I feel this wouldn&#x27;t hold larger sized brushes since theres not much room for the hair to hang but I&#x27;m sure the average size brush you&#x27;ll be fine. I have a rather large brush and it fits well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top holds your DE blade, but it starts to build a little soap scum in the razor holder area. But whatever, it&#x27;s manly and so are you!</li>
    <li> I could have gotten a cheaper stand. I could have tacked one together myself with some scrap steel lying around the garage. I could have repurposed a toothbrush holder, or redneck engineered something. But this adds some class to an otherwise class-less room in most people&#x27;s homes. My....shaving altar is like my own fortress of solitude in a bathroom full of beauty products.</li>
    <li> This is a good buy for the money.  It holds both the razor and the shaving brush.  The walnut color fits well with the decor.</li>
    <li> This is a nice looking stand which fits nicely for a brush and DE razor.  It&#x27;s clearly not hand-carved, and didn&#x27;t have a ton of sanding time put in before finishing but for this price, it&#x27;s not reasonable to expect something out of a fine woodworking shop (the labor alone on sanding would cost more than the price of this item even at minimum wage).</li>
    <li> The wood and finish are beautiful.  Holds my Parker badger brush perfectly.  Note that it is designed to hold safety razors sideways, and cartridge razors vertically.  This is partially true.  My Merkur Futur does sit across the top, sideways.  I still use a cartridge razor occasionally when I am in a real hurry to get out the door-and my Gillete Fusion does fit anywhere.  A friend of mine has a Merkur 34C, and it fits perfectly into the vertical position.  Essentially, if where the handle of your razor is still very narrow at the exact point where it meets the shaving head-it should fit vertically.  If your razor&#x27;s handle is round (cylindrical) is will sit nicely across the top.  If neither of those is true (as with a Gillette Fusion) it won&#x27;t fit anywhere.    That said, I am quite happy with it.  :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using the stand, but have to keep a folded paper towel under it because the walnut finish makes a mess on the counter when it gets wet. It took a lot of scrubbing to clean the counter top when I first discovered the problem. Someday, I&#x27;ll sand it off, but for now the paper towel is keeping the counter clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (7/10/12): Another reviewer mentioned how it would be nice if the stand wasn&#x27;t stained. That would be great! Another option would be for the stand to be coated with something so the wood stain wouldn&#x27;t run.</li>
    <li> Read some reviews that were less than favorable.  This worried me.  I gave this to my husband for Christmas.  He uses it daily.  Holds his straight razor w/o problem.  No tipping.  No stain problems w/ finish.  Overall, I&#x27;d say, good for the price.  Holds razor and brush well and makes countertop look neater.</li>
    <li> Bought this to go with the excellent new Parker razor my wife bought me for our anniversary.  It looks nice next to my sink.  The only complaint I would have would be the diameter of the brush holder - it is too small for my brush, and I have to work hard to get the brush into it without destroying the bristles.</li>
    <li> I love this shave stand. It appeared to be a bit lighter than on the photo but to me it&#x27;s even better. Rich surface texture is really impressive. Perfect product!</li>
    <li> Good product, shipped quickly, and I am satisfied with the purchase (as is the gift recipient). Only one complaint, the color of the item I received is not what is advertised. I expected I would get a dark mahogany/cherry colored piece, and instead got a walnut colored piece (tan color).  This is slightly irritating as I got another piece (wood soap bowl) to match this, and they are entirely different colors.</li>
    <li> Stylish, works perfectly and looks good doing it. Excellent  quality and price.</li>
    <li> Nice looking and hold my brush and razor perfectly.</li>
    <li> Not bad at all.  Not sure if I got an immaculate version or what but all of the comments about a bad finish do not apply to the one sent to me.  Was actually glad I read the bad reviews and worried, came out surprised in the end.  Will upgrade to 5 stars in a month or two if all is well still.  *******Have had this thing for months and it still is holding up.</li>
    <li> Good stand, but a little too big</li>
    <li> Nice product, doesn&#x27;t fit Power Fusion Razors though</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hold my shaving brush.  Hole was to small.  Looks cool though</li>
    <li> It is built decently. The brush holder was too small for one of my brushes and held my standard size brush by the part of the handle  near the bristles (rather than the end of the handle).</li>
    <li> I had a brush, I did not have a stand. Now I do, I bought this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- It&#x27;s exactly as advertised. Right down to the woodworking. The work itself is fine. The joints are smooth, the sealant is complete. It will hold up as is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- It holds the brush! It also holds the razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- It&#x27;s compact! I have a small bathroom/sink and this holds both items neatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad Things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- I have nothing bad to say. I&#x27;m a former woodworker, and this thing is fine for the price. There is definite room for improvement, but for the price... it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most Important Thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy again? Yes.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice looking piece. It holds the razor very well and that&#x27;s convenient. Unfortunately, the shaving brush I have didn&#x27;t fit the stand. The narrowest part of the slot where you put your brush is exactly 1\\&quot; across. Mine is a few tenths of an inch wider than that, so it&#x27;s not working for its intended purpose. At least it gives an excuse to upgrade to a nicer brush!</li>
    <li> While smaller than I expected, it is the perfect size for both my Tweezerman Brush and Futur Razor.  Only wish my razor would fit in the vertical holder.  Looks Snappy, though!  Returned one of those expensive chrome wire stands for this one.  This stand is not like a, \\&quot;shop\\&quot; project  as I have heard it described.  It is actually a beautiful unit and fits in well with the other mission style furniture I have.  Blows all chrome wire stands I have seen going for more money.</li>
    <li> I like the design and function of this stand, and it&#x27;s made out of nice hardwood. The finish however is another story. Unevenly applied, and there was what appeared to be mold growing at the bottom of the base. With a bit of steel wool and a couple coats of walnut finish/poly this is now a piece I&#x27;m proud to show off.  Fits my EJ DB89 razor and EJ badger brush like a glove. If you&#x27;re willing to give this stand a little TLC, it&#x27;s a nice alternative, and a better bang for the buck to the chrome options out there.</li>
    <li> My grandfather used to have a shaving stand just like this, and I had to have one. This stand is simple, elegant and sturdy. I had thought that the wood would not actually hold up to shaving conditions in the bathroom, but I was wrong. The finish is high quality and watertight. I also like the way the razor lays across the top in the groove, so it doesn&#x27;t fall off and even better, I don&#x27;t drop it trying to get it out of a standard shaving stand. My brush and razor fit perfectly, and every morning, I get reminded of my grandfather.</li>
    <li> The finish and the stability are decent, but I wish the top was a bit wider. My razor (Merkur 23C) doesn&#x27;t fit that well in the top groove.</li>
    <li> I have used this stand for a few years, and it&#x27;s done its job just fine-it&#x27;s not too hard to build something that holds a razor and a brush.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any problems with my brush still being wet when I got to use it again, so I assume the design allows it to dry out during the day.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that for the first few months I used it, whenever it got wet (which was most of the time--it was in a bathroom next to the sink) it would leave brown marks, the color of the finish, on the bathroom counter. I was always able to get them off, but it was a pain, and I was worried that if I ever left them for too long they would become permanent.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, probably not as nice as some of the metal stands available, but a lot cheaper, and great if you like wood.</li>
    <li> This is a well made product and is true to the pictures.  My husband has the Art of Shaving brush, which is a little wider in the handle than a standard brush.  He sanded it down a little so that his brush would fit.  Much nicer than a flimsy metal stand!</li>
    <li> this is a very well made stand for my brush and razor handle. there is not much to say about it, except that it keeps my brush clean and allows it to dry completely. it also keeps my razor handle away from other things in the bathroom and allows it to dry so that it and the blades in it do not rust. I will be using this stand for a very long time</li>
    <li> Great stand and great price, I ordered this stand with a starter kit with a cheaper synthetic brush Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush), the brush from this kit had a large handle did not fit as well but i knew that it was a inexpensive kit 10$ and if i enjoyed wet shaving that i would upgrade to a pure badger hair brush, and the stand now holds my higher quality brush beautifly. Great Buy and Great Price very simple...</li>
    <li> This is a nice shave brush stand, especially for the price.  I have used plastic models which break and don&#x27;t hold up after a time of use.  This one is attractive, useful and seems to perform well.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful and functional razor/brush stand.  This stand has passed the ultimate test- my wife doesn&#x27;t mind me leaving it out on the vanity.  It allows my brush to dry very well and neatly displays my razor at the same time.  I have really enjoyed this stand.</li>
    <li> bought this for a brush i have. Its not tall enough and the brush touches the curve of this stand. It will fit the smaller brush that i have just fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for more than a year after getting it as a Christmas gift.  I love the classic styling, but the finish is so bad that the water simply washes it off, slowly over the course of weeks/months, exposing the bare wood.  My counter gets brown stains on it that I have to wipe off frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that a product that is obviously assumed to be used in a wet environment, and specifically to dry out a wet brush doesn&#x27;t have a waterproof finish is completely unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t go with one star here is because of the good styling and the fact that it is a sturdy stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get your act together, Mr. Manufacturer.</li>
    <li> The brushes and razors don&#x27;t fit on stand.  I  have tried several.</li>
    <li> This is a solid, serviceable stand for your razor and brush.  As other reviewers have noted, the finish isn&#x27;t great and does not react well to water, which means that after a few months of service this piece might start to look a little rough.  I&#x27;ve found that a good scrubbing with an antibacterial wipe can get rid of much of the residue and restore some of the stand&#x27;s shine.  I&#x27;ve had mine for four years and it still looks pretty good thanks to this treatment.&lt;br /&gt;All gripes aside, though, let&#x27;s not forget that this is a cheap and easy alternative to some of the other ludicrously overpriced razor and brush stands on the market that are meant to capitalize on overindulgent shavegeeks.  For ~$20, this is a great choice if you want something classier looking than the dinky plastic stand that came with your shaving brush and you aren&#x27;t interested in similarly priced chrome stands that have a sterile, barber shop feel to them.</li>
    <li> I bought this stand for my husband, he was leaving his razor on the counter, now it rests on this.  It is pretty and it dries faster</li>
    <li> I knocked one start off for poor packaging because it was a gift but the product was just like it looked in the picture. Good quality.</li>
    <li> It looks exactly like the picture.  The finish is a bit rough. Fits nicely in a medicine cabinet, and the top groove holds my razor okay.  The cut out for my shaving brush (a small brush) is a little too narrow though.</li>
    <li> Nice brush stand, I have a large knot on my brush and it fits fine.  I wish they would have made the notch deeper on the top to hold a straight razor; I made it deeper myself with a router and now the straight razor doesn&#x27;t slip or fall out.  A great alternative to a metal stand.</li>
    <li> Too short to hold a brush.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas, and it was a hit.  Nice quality and nice looking too! Thank you</li>
    <li> was looking for a wooden razor holder and brush stand for a while, and came across this and it is compact and elegant.  Provided you dry off your razor and squeeze out excess water from the brush before using, it will last a long time.  Happy with this for sure.</li>
    <li> I uploaded an image also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product looks good and is shaped perfectly for my brush and razor.  Much better looking than the plastic holders. If you prefer the wood look over the metal stands, this is a great find.</li>
    <li> Ok, so my wife bought this for me a few weeks ago here on Amazon. I thought it looked great. First problem I had was my brush did not fit. I have a Van der Hagen shave set. It&#x27;s a cheap starter set and the brush is too fat to fit the stand. This is obviously not the fault of the stand. I just place the brush laying across the arms. And that works fine. After the first time i shaved, the water that dripped off the brush onto the curved slope caused the stand to leak stain onto my sink. That initial leak actually caused the stand to stick to the counter just a bit. After cleaning it up and putting it back, it kept leaking stain. I decided to send it back to amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does look nice, and it holds my razor and brush (sideways) but if it&#x27;s gonna lose color so soon, I&#x27;d rather not have it fade out in a few months.</li>
    <li> Beautiful work of art and highly functional</li>
    <li> Looks great, but the stain runs off the wood when you put a damp brush and razor on it to drip dry. I keep finding dark brown stains on my countertop.</li>
    <li> I wanted a travel shaving brush stand. I travel with a full size shaving brush. The Mission style wood stand for razor and brush looks good wherever I take it.</li>
    <li> I received a gold Merkur 34C for Christmas and needed a correspondingly tasteful stand for it and my new Escali brush. This one fits the bill beautifully. It&#x27;s like handcrafted furniture for your bathroom. The dark wood compliments the gold of my razor and light wood of my brush. Overall a great purchase at a great price.</li>
    <li> i am a really wealthy man with a lot of hair all over my body and this is good for me.</li>
    <li> Gifted to someone else who loved it.</li>
    <li> Takes a smaller brush than what I own, It still fits.  I am not worried about it.  Make sure you measure your brush.</li>
    <li> Really nice, beautiful.</li>
    <li> Good workmanship. It appears to be made of solid wood.  Looks very solid. Excellent gift for my husband.  Thanks. The end</li>
    <li> The brush handle I have  will not fit through opening, it has to be put through the bristles and crushes them.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat this. It holds standard razors as well as safety razors, and it&#x27;s made very well. Very nice addition to my bathroom.</li>
    <li> It is made of (what appears to be) solid wood, holds a razor and a brush well. It&#x27;s, unfortunately, a bit short, though, so you may find you can&#x27;t hold your brush on it by the handle, but rather, you may have to hang the brush at the point where the knot meets the handle.</li>
    <li> I saw some of the negative reviews about this stand saying it looked like a bad high-school shop class project but decided, what the hell, I&#x27;d give it a try anyway.  Am I glad I did.  The stand was beautifully finished and there was not a rough spot on it.  It looks great on my bathroom counter and holds my razor and brush just fine.  Maybe the guys who wrote negative reviews just got some bad items but mine was great.</li>
    <li> This is made of superb dark hardwood and not some cheesy plastic or resin.  I really enjoy using it and expect it to out last me. So it&#x27;s a bargain even though a bit expensive.  Quality tools that last a lifetime are always worth more.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  I love it.  It holds my shaving brush upside down so it can dry properly and also fits any type of razor in my medicine cabinet.  Useful and very beautiful.</li>
    <li> I love the color and the simple design. I would recommend this model to any new shaver as I am.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t a whole lot to say about this stand, but it looks good and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I does seem like the stain used on the stand runs a bit from the water dripping from a brush.</li>
    <li> Return Details: There is no good way to set my double-edged razor on it so that it sits stable and balanced. It sits awkwardly and the razor topples--NOT SAFE!</li>
    <li> I bought this stand because it matches the molding &amp; misc. other items in my bathroom. its seems like its constructed well &amp; feels solid enough. my only issue with it is the stain that was used on the product runs &amp; will either stain your countertops or leave a stain residue wherever you sit the stand &amp; surrounding areas. i do try to shake or squeeze as much water out of my shaving \\&quot;equipment\\&quot; as possible before setting them on the stand, but the fact is, you&#x27;re using items than NEED to get wet to use them (i.e. razor, brush....). it seems with just a LITTLE \\&quot;real life\\&quot; testing, the manufacturer would&#x27;ve noticed this, or have noticed... but just don&#x27;t care. After a few months of use, stain will wear off in areas, making it ( &amp; you) looking cheep. For the money spent on this, I would probably tell you to look elsewhere for a stand, perhaps a stainless steel or chrome one.</li>
    <li> I really like this stand. I have a chrome razor and brush and it provides a nice contrast which gives the set a very modern look. It is important to note that the brush is supposed to sit along the top of the area that holds it with only the actual bristles being inside of the opening (whereas some stands are made to go around the concave part of the brush handle).</li>
    <li> I like this for my razor in the shower. The wood is still solid and my brush and razor fit.</li>
    <li> Wife purchased this for me for Father&#x27;s Day. Please excuse the lack of purchase verification as it was ordered through her account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice piece for the price. Some of the feedback on the quality and finish is accurate. It&#x27;s not a piece of wooden art... but I didn&#x27;t expect that for $18. It looks nice, it is presentable and keeps with my masculine wooden-theme at my sink compared to the explosion of make-up and hair products on my wife&#x27;s side of our double vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets the job done. Holds my badger brush for proper drying, holds my Merkur safety razor on the back. The razor is stable and fits pretty well. I like being able to hang my shaving items neatly for drying.</li>
    <li> It looks great, although my brush barely fits in it.  I have to squeeze the bristles together tightly and then really force it in for it to work.  Could just be my brush size, of course.</li>
    <li> If this stand sits in water (which it will because it is a bathroom product), the stain will bleed and get on your stuff. These stains will clean up, but it is really annoying. Should have coated it in crystal clear or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are using this with a 2 or 3 piece razor, the guides not he bottom of the head of the razor will interfere with the little ledge the razor is supposed to sit on, so it actually won&#x27;t hold your razor. Will probably hold a cartridge razor just fine, though.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman brush first perfectly and so does merkur safety razor....i used double sided tape on medicine cabinet mirror...works well..&lt;br /&gt;and looks nice !!!</li>
    <li> This is a very attractive piece of hardwood. Holds the brush in place and doesn&#x27;t wobble at all. However, the razor holder is a bit shallow, causing the razor to fall if it&#x27;s slightly bumped. Nothing a little sanding couldn&#x27;t fix, but it loses as star for this.</li>
    <li> This really looks great combined with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000068U49 Kingsley For Men Wood Shave Soap Bowl with Lid - 1 ea]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Touch of simple elegance and does the job just fine too.</li>
    <li> There is NOTHING bad about this product.  Extremely affordable. Picture is actually inaccurate as it looks like rough unfinished wood. It has a very shiny &amp; smooth finish. It holds my safety razor and full size brush with no problem.  The brush barely touches the wood and it still dries perfectly fine.  Note: the brush is inserted where the handle meets the bristles, not at the top where there is a slight inset; this is purely for grip.  Yes it does fit in my medicine cabinet as other reviews have stated. And yes it is sturdy feeling as some reviews have denied.  It&#x27;s not heavy or light. I think it&#x27;s just right. Don&#x27;t spend $20 on a razor stand or a brush stand alone, or a combo from a retailer for $60-$100.  just get this one; it&#x27;s not fancy shiny metal but it works perfectly fine.</li>
    <li> The stand is beautiful and unique, however the craftsmanship leaves a bit to be desired:&lt;br /&gt;- the stain and lacquer has runs in multiple places, leaving an uneven coat - this is not visible from a distance, but I tend to be a little picky with the items I have sitting our for display.&lt;br /&gt;- the &amp;#34;arm&amp;#34; holding the brush is an independent piece of wood barely glued in place (mine came loose after 3 weeks of use)&lt;br /&gt;- the thickness of the &amp;#34;arm&amp;#34; snags the bottom of the bristles on my brush, causing undue stress and will probably shorten the overall life of your (expensive) brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the holder for your handle is smooth and even, and holds most sizes perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy I bought this stand, but wish a little more love had been put into rounding it off.</li>
    <li> It is a quality product</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my father&#x27;s birthday. He kept his shaving brush in a mirrored cabinet in the bathroom sitting up on its handle so, it wasn&#x27;t dripping and drying properly. This stand corrected that problem and added joy to my father&#x27;s shaving experience as well.</li>
    <li> If you like the look of hand crafted shave stands this is a great choice if the industrial look of the simple metal stands isn&#x27;t your style.</li>
    <li> Very nice. It&#x27;s been a year now since I bought it and the finish is slowly going away, but it sits on a shower shelf, so that&#x27;s expected. It is kind of a tight squeeze to get the brush into it, but it hasn&#x27;t seemed to hurt the brush. Very pretty wood grain.</li>
    <li> I got this as part of a surprise gift for my husband and he loved it! It looks great sitting on our bathroom counter!</li>
    <li> Came as expected. Shorter than planned for my razor smaller than my brush, but it is still functional and looks nice.</li>
    <li> Perfeftly matches the Kingsley soap dish. Space for razor and brush and looks great by the sink. Quality materials and workmanship.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my man but he passed away before getting to use it. I have it in the bathroom on a shelf. It&#x27;s a nice decor piece and reminds me of him daily.</li>
    <li> Looks better than the stand that came with my Parker brush. Also looks cooler than the stand that came with my Parker brush. And it&#x27;s simple and humble.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple, attractive and inexpensive. After a year of daily use right next to the bathroom sink, it looks just like it did when I bought it, with no stains, cracking, or splitting despite exposure to lots of moisture.</li>
    <li> Smaller that you realize.  Wish it were heavier but it does the job of displaying my rig nicely.  Fit into the Arts and Crafts bathroom!</li>
    <li> A handy sturdy place to hold brush and razor together.  Looks great too.  Keeps the bathroom neat.  Quality workmanship is attractive.</li>
    <li> This was a nice shave stand but it did not fit the brush or razor that I have.  The brush and razor are standard size so I am not sure why it wouldn&#x27;t fit.  Seemed to be made well though.</li>
    <li> This is nicely made for its purpose.  The fit and quality of the workmanship and the wood, is very good.  The only thing I would suggest for an improvement, is to have the base a little wider for greater stability.</li>
    <li> Arrived as advertized</li>
    <li> Husband loves his gift.</li>
    <li> As advertised prompt service.</li>
    <li> This stand looks good, has a decent finish. But it does not fit my brush, and its just a regular brush. The entry is too narrow, but once I squeeze it through it fits fine. Might have to file away a bit at the edges. The razor also does not sit flush in the groove. I have the Parker 96R. The turn-screw on top for the butterfly open is too big for this groove. Something to keep in mind.</li>
    <li> Love this thing... makes it so easy to just hang the brush on it when done to dry. It really helps the brush to last a lot longer as this is how its supposed to be done after using it.</li>
    <li> The finish on this product is cheaply done, but overall it seems well balanced. The brush and razor fit well.</li>
    <li> Looks nice, holds my razor.</li>
    <li> The stand looks very nice, but it needs something on the bottom. A brush will inevitably drip water, and when that happens a bit of the varnish will leech off.</li>
    <li> Looks great and works decently, but not the best for someone with a small bathroom and very little sink space. I would&#x27;ve bought a metal one if I had known how blocky and difficult to transport this would be. It does the job though, so I won&#x27;t be returning it any time soon.</li>
    <li> This is a handsome yet compact solution for your razor and brush.  It makes my sink area look a lot better and makes me feel organized.  The finish is a little amateur but sufficient.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Mission Style wood shave stand for my husband for Christmas. He and I both love how it looks, as well as functions. It has allowed him to keep his safety razor and brush to dry in one location right next to his shave soap. After looking at many other stands, this one was the only wood one we found that had a walnut finish as well as the clean Mission style lines.</li>
    <li> I bought the H.I.S. shaving brush, which has a slightly larger knot than most badger brushes, so it&#x27;s a tight squeeze into the holder.  After a few weeks of use though, the brush compacted a bit and it goes on fine.</li>
    <li> Wish the top groove was wider to accommodate wider razors laying sideways, and if the diameter was wider it would also be superior. This is a good product.</li>
    <li> Looks nice &amp; hold the shaver as well as the bristle brush.</li>
    <li> I took a chance on buying this, not sure how it would work. To my surprise it was perfect! It fits in my medicine cabinet with room to spare and it looks great. It holds my Edwin Jagger razor and brush. I like the fact that you have two choices how you want to have it hold your razor. Hanging down across the back or across the top. Very good design.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would say about this product on a negative note is the finish was not very smooth and had runs in the finish.  (hence the 4 stars not 5). I would not let this stop you from purchasing this product. I will buy this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Unsuitable for use with highly rated bargain &#x27;Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush&#x27; by GFT.  The hanging arm slot / hole too small for brush handle to fit - e.g. brush will not hang as deigned.  Furthermore the stand it is so short it probably damage the brush by pressing it out of shape even if the brush would fit into the hanger slot.</li>
    <li> Its alright, I don&#x27;t think I would recommend it over others if one has more money to spend, but it does work and for the price I guess you cant really beat it. it is a little small though and I have a few brushes that will not fit. also the hole is not all that well sanded so if that matters to you then deff don&#x27;t get this. otherwise go for it if you don&#x27;t have more to spend haha</li>
    <li> Very good functional design. Will hold a brush and D.E. razor, or even a cartridge razor (there is a clever slot down the center of the back that allows for a razor to be held vertically also). Attractive &amp;#34;Mission Style&amp;#34; hardwood accessory (may actually be walnut). The color/stain is pleasing and evenly applied. Where they dropped the ball on this was in the final finish. The clear coat (which I assume to be polyurethane)  is very sloppy with many runs and drips. Just an annoying detail that could easily be avoided. The next time I&#x27;m doing a project with Spar, I&#x27;ll sand and re-finish it.</li>
    <li> It does its job and looks pretty damn cool. Displays my brush and razor very nicely.</li>
    <li> Just got it and the opening&#x27;s too narrow for my VDH brush, (even at the bristle knot but not a deal breaker) but I am looking to replace it with a Semogue in the future and hopefully that one will fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something other than the chrome varieties available and it was less than 20 bucks.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift, but wish I had purchased for myself. Soon...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for close to a year now and it&#x27;s a bit of a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits most shave brushes, and yes it will hold a DE razor. However, it is too short to hold any of the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; raxors (Mach 3, Fusion, etc), so if you have one of those I recommend laying it flat on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the problems: I know that you are supposed to dry your shave equipment before putting it away, but then again, you shave in the bathroom, so water is going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;After about 4 months I noticed some small wearing on the stain near the brush mount. Now, 12 months later, most of the original stain has worn off on the entire stand (conspicuously in little water drop shaped circles).&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t mind because the aesthetic of the product wasn&#x27;t really an issue for me in my crappy campus bathroom, but for $17, you can find a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Holds brush and Razor&lt;br /&gt;-Nice design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Product is on the smaller end (~3.5\\&quot; tall)&lt;br /&gt;-Stain wears off extremely easily</li>
    <li> Works Great fits my brush and holds my razor, I wish I had found it sooner.  Looks Great. I&#x27;m going to get one for my DAD.</li>
    <li> Holds brush well, but is not so wide as I had believed at first. Somewhat lighter than I would have expected.</li>
    <li> Beautiful stand for brush and safety razor. The stand will only hold brushes will larger handles. When my current brush wears out I will buy a thicker handled brush to accommodate.</li>
    <li> Works great, dries the brush upside down so it doesn&#x27;t get misshapen, smelly, etc.  Looks very nice on the counter.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even fit my brush.  The picture online looks infinitely better than the real thing.  This thing is absolutely useless.</li>
    <li> For something this affordable, the woodworking is beautiful. I wanted to love this stand, because of how great it looks, but unfortunately it&#x27;s just not very well designed to hold a brush. The space between the arms of the brush holder is so small that it rips at the hairs of the brush as you pull it in and out, pulling out and breaking the hairs, occasionally. It&#x27;s a real pity, because all they&#x27;d have to do is open up the space a little bit and it would still hold a brush just fine, and avoid all the problems.</li>
    <li> It looks nice but only disposable razors fit well in it, safety razors dont</li>
    <li> I chose to switch from shaving jell because last couple of Gillette shaving jell cans last the pressure and I was stuck with a full unusable can. Therefore, I decided to go old school brush and soap. Did little research and learned that wet shaving is better for your skin, closer shave, less ingrown hair.&lt;br /&gt;This little brush holder will complete your set; looks much better then some cheap Chinese plastic. This stand does have a spot for razor but it is not universal.&lt;br /&gt;Overall go for it you will like it.</li>
