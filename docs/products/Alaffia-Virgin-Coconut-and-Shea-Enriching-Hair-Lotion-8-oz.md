      <li>so I was happy.</li>
      <li>So glad I did!!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more today!!</li>
      <li>The smell is very nice..</li>
      <li>I decided to try this one day and it is amazing!  </li>
      <li>This is a great product, smells amazing and is a great consistency.  </li>
      <li>Loved this lotion</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or oily, which is good.  </li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>I love the scent--like a creamsicle!  </li>
      <li>But it does also take kind of a lot to stop the frizz and give my hair some softness and shine.  </li>
      <li>it kind of smells like a dentist office.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a nice leave in conditioner without any silicones</li>
      <li>It is perhaps not the best detangler I have ever used, but it is good enough, and doesn&#x27;t affect the 5-star rating I&#x27;m giving it.</li>
      <li>It smells nice close up and won&#x27;t interfere with most types of perfumes.</li>
      <li>Love it as always.  </li>
      <li>My hair needs extra moisture and this is the perfect trick.</li>
      <li>The lotion looks more like a leave-in, so I tried to use it twice.</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair feels so much better since we started using this product.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smoothes and moisturizes my hair and adds body.  </li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>wonder if part of the issue with why it isn&#x27;t perfect for me is that I&#x27;m expecting more slip/shine of the kind that comes with silicone heavy products.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great as a leave in conditioner for natural, curly hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m off to buy the full size!</li>
      <li>My hair was moisturized when I used this, but my sister pointed out that it makes my hair kind of greasy looking even though I didn&#x27;t apply very much.  </li>
      <li>This hair lotion is like a miracle elixir which has transformed my morning hair styling from a torture session with a struggling two year old to a totally pleasant bonding time.</li>
      <li>The smell was fantastic.</li>
      <li>Really wonderful, but not overwhelming--</li>
      <li>Clean ingredient list.  </li>
      <li>I used to always supplement my leave-ins with a little mouse to get more definition, but with this product my curls look healthy and great all on their own, plus stay moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not usually loyal to any one brand of hair product, as most curly girls know our hair can be indecisive.</li>
      <li>but the company sent another quick</li>
      <li>A little overwhelming at first but perfect 20 minutes later.</li>
      <li>It was nice going on but didn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It smells lovely and leaves my hair soft and with a bit of curl.</li>
      <li>but other wise i like it alot and try to get use to the smell</li>
      <li>I would say that its only okay.</li>
      <li>I first use the Shea &amp; Coconut shampoo, followed by the Shea &amp; Coconut conditioner in the shower.</li>
      <li>It seems to be the perfect balance for my hair-type, which is usually curly and frizzy in the summer, dry,staticky and flat in the winter.  </li>
      <li>I got mine at Whole Foods</li>
      <li>I bought a sample of this at Whole Foods.  </li>
      <li>I wash and condition, gently comb my hair, divide it into thirds, then use about a quarter sized dollop for each section.</li>
      <li>I bought a sample size of this at Whole Foods</li>
      <li>with this hair lotion, I get some real curl definition.</li>
      <li>It is so reasonably priced though, that this isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
      <li>Thanks Terri for the recommendation.  </li>
      <li>I originally tried this product as a sample at my local co-op</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way and smells great.</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m done, there is nothing left to rinse off my palms -- everything got absorbed into my hair shafts!  </li>
      <li>Plus my better half really likes the smell.</li>
      <li>I then put about a quarter-size amount of the lotion on my wet hair and it makes it so easy to comb out.  </li>
      <li>The orange geranium scent is fresh and may seem a bit strong for some at first, but it fades quite a bit after hair dries so it is quite subtle.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for my natural hair.</li>
      <li>okay, leaves my hair feeling a bit heavy</li>
      <li>It smells fresh, feels light (not heavy) but definitely defines my curls nicely (long 3B hair).</li>
      <li>My newly washed hair immediately felt like</li>
      <li>I have fine hair but lots of it, that goes down to about my bra strap.  </li>
      <li>In the morning, my hair is very soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>My hair is also very soft, bouncy and shiny when it dries.  </li>
      <li>Unlike many other similar products, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or crunchy.  </li>
      <li>I bought it as a hair lotion which usually is a leave-in and also is what&#x27;s indicated by many reviewers.</li>
      <li>I bought this product to use on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a fan of natural hair products, I would definitely suggest giving this a try.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for curly or dry hair.</li>
      <li>It leaves my long, naturally curly (3b, 3c) red  hair soft and adds shines without the dreaded &#x27;cones.</li>

<li> My hair is soft, moisturized and not weighed down.</li>
<li> I appreciate the fact that this lotion doesn&#x27;t have that nasty salon chemically smell; in fact, it doesn&#x27;t smell of much at all, which is perfectly OK with me!  </li>
<li> I have dry, wavy hair, thinnish, and</li>
<li> am actually surprised that this product iis not more main-stream.</li>
<li> One of them has more textured and drier hair and the other is curly and thinner, but nearly impossible to comb.</li>
<li> You put it on your hair while wet but don&#x27;t rinse out.  </li>
<li> My other daughter, whose hair tends towards the nappy, needs additional jojoba and coconut oil before this is applied to keep it moisturized, but it still works for her.</li>
<li> by the time your hair dries, it will not interfere with other scented products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I may try other products by this company too.</li>
<li> I have quite thin, more wavy than curly hair, that can look dead-straight with the wrong conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> maybe half a day and needed to be combined with other thing.</li>
<li> Not worth my time to return it</li>
<li> But it is too heavy and greasy.</li>
<li> I use this lotion everyday as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used Wen cleansing conditioner for the past 4 years.</li>
<li> I am not sure what to do with this product.</li>
<li> but it was a little thin.</li>
<li> The directions say that it can be left in the hair, but I always rinse it - I&#x27;m afraid of the 80&#x27;s &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34;, Though it absorbs so well into the hair, it probably wouldn&#x27;t  be an issue.  </li>
<li> My bottle was broken when it came</li>

    <li> I have type 3B/3C pencil sized spiral curls.  As a devout follower of [...], when Terri recommended this I decided to give it a  try. So glad I did!!  No crunchiness and I definitely notice that my curls are moisturized.  Thanks Terri for the recommendation.  I&#x27;m ordering more today!!</li>
    <li> i like it alot the only thing is i dont like the smell of it. it kind of smells like a dentist office. but other wise i like it alot and try to get use to the smell</li>
    <li> Bought This for my wife, she loves it!</li>
    <li> This is great for my hair.  I have locs. After washing, while my hair is damp, I add this to my hair in sections. My hair is soft, moisturized and not weighed down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen cleansing conditioner for the past 4 years. I decided to try this one day and it is amazing!  I use this as my detangler.  I first use the Shea &amp; Coconut shampoo, followed by the Shea &amp; Coconut conditioner in the shower. I then put about a quarter-size amount of the lotion on my wet hair and it makes it so easy to comb out.  My hair is also very soft, bouncy and shiny when it dries.  Love it!  I got mine at Whole Foods</li>
    <li> Love the product. A little goes a long way and smells great. My daughter&#x27;s hair feels so much better since we started using this product.</li>
    <li> My hair was moisturized when I used this, but my sister pointed out that it makes my hair kind of greasy looking even though I didn&#x27;t apply very much.  I no longer use this.</li>
    <li> okay, leaves my hair feeling a bit heavy</li>
    <li> Love it as always.  My hair needs extra moisture and this is the perfect trick.</li>
    <li> Clean ingredient list.  And conditions well.  Definite difference if I dont condition after shampooing.  Plus my better half really likes the smell.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, smells amazing and is a great consistency.  You put it on your hair while wet but don&#x27;t rinse out.  It keeps my hair manageable.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great as a leave in conditioner for natural, curly hair. I spritz my hair with some distilled water and then apply this and twist up my hair before bed. In the morning, my hair is very soft and moisturized. The smell is very nice.. Like oranges with a hint of geranium. If you&#x27;re a fan of natural hair products, I would definitely suggest giving this a try.</li>
    <li> I bought a sample of this at Whole Foods.  I was looking for a nice leave in conditioner without any silicones and I found this.  I love the scent--like a creamsicle!  Really wonderful, but not overwhelming--by the time your hair dries, it will not interfere with other scented products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or oily, which is good.  But it does also take kind of a lot to stop the frizz and give my hair some softness and shine.  I have dry, wavy hair, thinnish, and so while I want something moisturizing that will control frizz, I also don&#x27;t want something too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if part of the issue with why it isn&#x27;t perfect for me is that I&#x27;m expecting more slip/shine of the kind that comes with silicone heavy products.  This doesn&#x27;t have them.  I&#x27;m going to keep using my sample (and stay away from the &#x27;cones) and will likely buy a bigger bottle after I&#x27;m done with it.  I may try other products by this company too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always trying different conditioners. I bought a sample size of this at Whole Foods and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;It smells lovely and leaves my hair soft and with a bit of curl. I have quite thin, more wavy than curly hair, that can look dead-straight with the wrong conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with this hair lotion, I get some real curl definition. I&#x27;m not that keen on the wax in the product as that can build up - but I can always clarify. I wouldn&#x27;t use this daily on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m off to buy the full size!</li>
    <li> I use this lotion everyday as a leave-in conditioner. It smells fresh, feels light (not heavy) but definitely defines my curls nicely (long 3B hair). I used to always supplement my leave-ins with a little mouse to get more definition, but with this product my curls look healthy and great all on their own, plus stay moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not usually loyal to any one brand of hair product, as most curly girls know our hair can be indecisive. But this product stuck with me and I continue to come back to it when I&#x27;m running out. Only wish Amazon would provide this on Prime!</li>
    <li> I am not sure what to do with this product. I bought it as a hair lotion which usually is a leave-in and also is what&#x27;s indicated by many reviewers. But the bottle has instruction that states to rinse it off.I asked the owner question and never received a response.    Not worth my time to return it, so I decided to try it out. The lotion looks more like a leave-in, so I tried to use it twice. But it is too heavy and greasy. My newly washed hair immediately felt like haven&#x27;t been washed for 2 or 3 days. I used it as a wash-out and it did not do anything different to my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair. One of them has more textured and drier hair and the other is curly and thinner, but nearly impossible to comb. This hair lotion is like a miracle elixir which has transformed my morning hair styling from a torture session with a struggling two year old to a totally pleasant bonding time. It has a lot of slip, is what I&#x27;m saying. My other daughter, whose hair tends towards the nappy, needs additional jojoba and coconut oil before this is applied to keep it moisturized, but it still works for her. Definitely give this a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for several months.  I love the way it smoothes and moisturizes my hair and adds body.  Unlike many other similar products, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or crunchy.  I have fine hair but lots of it, that goes down to about my bra strap.  I squeeze a couple of blobs of this stuff onto my palms, massage it into my hair, and them comb out.  When I&#x27;m done, there is nothing left to rinse off my palms -- everything got absorbed into my hair shafts!  I appreciate the fact that this lotion doesn&#x27;t have that nasty salon chemically smell; in fact, it doesn&#x27;t smell of much at all, which is perfectly OK with me!  It is perhaps not the best detangler I have ever used, but it is good enough, and doesn&#x27;t affect the 5-star rating I&#x27;m giving it.</li>
    <li> I originally tried this product as a sample at my local co-op a couple of years ago.  It seems to be the perfect balance for my hair-type, which is usually curly and frizzy in the summer, dry,staticky and flat in the winter.  Now I have ringlets year-round. The directions say that it can be left in the hair, but I always rinse it - I&#x27;m afraid of the 80&#x27;s &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34;, Though it absorbs so well into the hair, it probably wouldn&#x27;t  be an issue.  am actually surprised that this product iis not more main-stream.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave-in conditioner I have ever found. I wash and condition, gently comb my hair, divide it into thirds, then use about a quarter sized dollop for each section. It is so reasonably priced though, that this isn&#x27;t a problem. The orange geranium scent is fresh and may seem a bit strong for some at first, but it fades quite a bit after hair dries so it is quite subtle. It smells nice close up and won&#x27;t interfere with most types of perfumes. It leaves my long, naturally curly (3b, 3c) red  hair soft and adds shines without the dreaded &#x27;cones. I hope the company adds shampoo and rinse out conditioner for dry/curly hair with the same scent. Highly recommended for curly or dry hair.</li>
    <li> Loved this lotion but it was a little thin. I gave it to my sister for my nieces hair and it kept her hair moisturized. My bottle was broken when it came but the company sent another quick so I was happy.</li>
    <li> I would say that its only okay. It didn&#x27;t do much for my natural hair. 4A in the nape area, 4B everywhere else. It was nice going on but didn&#x27;t last all day. maybe half a day and needed to be combined with other thing. The best thing about it was the smell. The smell was fantastic. A little overwhelming at first but perfect 20 minutes later. I would give it 2.5 stars if  that were an option.</li>
