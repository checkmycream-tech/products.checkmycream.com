      <li>The consistency of the polish itself is great, I didn&#x27;t need to use nail polish thinner or anything.</li>
      <li>it works great.</li>
      <li>Works great for nail art and stamping.</li>
      <li>It was great and it got here before the estimated delivery date.</li>

      <li>It has a good consistency and covers well.</li>
      <li>Otherwise good color to wear.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re thinking to use this for nail art, then fine, it&#x27;s a fair nail polish.</li>
      <li>I love this so much!!!!!</li>
      <li>the paint chips very easily without a top coat.</li>
      <li>The color is okay.</li>
      <li>This is totally the perfect one!!!</li>

      <li>I really love this this nail polish.</li>

      <li>I LOVE</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed using all of these colors for stamping nail designs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that I bought it.</li>
      <li>You need to do two coats of the color to make sure the polish is opaque.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>took alittle while to come tho( chose normal shipping) besides that it was a great product.</li>
      <li>It shows up really well, like 2 coats and you are good.</li>
      <li>The Polish chips way too easily.</li>
      <li>Love it so much, it goes on nice</li>
      <li>Bright white &amp; durable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good white nail polish.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and drys super fast!</li>
      <li>Clean white color, very bright, only need one coat.</li>
      <li>However, I know exactly what I&#x27;m going to buy when I do run out!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now I can retouch my french tip on my own 😊</li>
      <li>I have not used it as it is not the right color</li>
      <li>This picture was from the first time I used this polish.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It came so fast!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>the top of the cap fell off so only the paint brush is on.</li>
      <li>I have been searching for a good white nail polish that you only have to put one coat on</li>
      <li>Dries pretty fast.</li>
      <li>Worked really well the first time I used it, just had to do 2 coats.</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re wanting solid nails of white, look elsewhere unless you want to end up with a 3 mm-thick coat of paint on top of your nails from the effort of getting it smooth before giving up.</li>
      <li>The brush that comes in the lid is easy to use and the lid is totally leak proof.</li>
      <li>This nail polish is a lot better quality than what I expected.</li>
      <li>its also a good white, youll need about 2 thin coats its not watery though, its a good opaque white</li>
      <li>but you will need at least two coats, but it&#x27;s a beautiful winter white color!</li>
      <li>The polish is more thick than thin, but it is perfect for doing a french nail at home!</li>
      <li>: the second time I used it, it was clumpy and wouldn&#x27;t spread right.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good nail polish in itself, but when I received it, the brush bristles were twisted, and remain so, and they&#x27;re in a sort of spiral so that I can never get the paint to brush on in a straight line.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absolutely everything I hoped for and more plain and simple.</li>
      <li>I bought the white nail polish, I like the fact the paint dries fast.</li>
      <li>Did not dry all the way, would rub off even after waiting 30 minutes!!</li>
      <li>I am not sure if I like this item, since I never received the correct color (First they gave me yellow, than second a light pink color.)</li>
      <li>Only needs 2 coats for complete coverage of the nail.  </li>
      <li>The only thing that kept me from giving this nail polish 5 stars is that there isn&#x27;t as much polish in the container as I expected.</li>
      <li>Nice white but its a little thin.</li>

<li> Nice white but its a little thin.</li>
<li> It did not last long.</li>
<li> But it doesn&#x27;t last very long, like maybe 3 or 5 days.</li>
<li> I got to keep the pink color, but I believe they said they wouldn&#x27;t return it for a second time.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on for too long.</li>
<li> IT IS A VERY GLOOPY THICK POLISH.</li>
<li> BUT IT TAKES SOOOOO LONG TO DRY.</li>
<li> I decided to pick up silver, black and white from Kleancolor.</li>
<li> The description is wrong and the picture is miss leading as it appears to be white but in fact is a very brownish cream.  </li>
<li> It drives me crazy and I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;m only going to use this bottle for nail art that I can dip another, smaller and straight brush into.</li>
<li> So the pink color my child likes.</li>
<li> Not very durable.</li>
<li> I added clear nail polish to make it not so thick.</li>
<li> Goes on thick and chunky and looks like white out.</li>
<li> Really thick white nail polish.</li>
<li> so the neon colors I use would pop and would need less coats.</li>
<li> I keep reading reviews about the product saying it smells really bad, but I didn&#x27;t really notice.</li>
<li> And I had to apply at least 10 layers on each nail for it to even look like I had anything on, way to watery .</li>
<li> Too thick and globby.</li>
<li> it is very thick and usually covers for me in one coat.</li>
<li> And I also got tired of the run around.</li>
<li> I thought it smelled just as bad as any other nail polish.</li>
<li> Maybe I just got a bad bottle, but this went on clumpy and uneven.  </li>
<li> and again they gave me the wrong color.</li>
<li> The brush is useless and I don&#x27;t know what to do about</li>
<li> The brush also suffers from stray bristles.</li>
<li> But it smells like bad bubble gum though.</li>
<li> I would not want anyone to be disappointed like I was.</li>
<li> I bought this as a base coat</li>
<li> AND IT SMELL TERRIBLE</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this polish. Works great for nail art and stamping.</li>
    <li> Goes on thick and chunky and looks like white out.</li>
    <li> Too thick and globby. The brush was also deformed.</li>
    <li> Worked really well the first time I used it, just had to do 2 coats. This picture was from the first time I used this polish.&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE: the second time I used it, it was clumpy and wouldn&#x27;t spread right. It works well for stamping, but not painting your entire nail.</li>
    <li> It shows up really well, like 2 coats and you are good. But it doesn&#x27;t last very long, like maybe 3 or 5 days. I keep reading reviews about the product saying it smells really bad, but I didn&#x27;t really notice. I thought it smelled just as bad as any other nail polish. One thing though,  didn&#x27;t realize I could get it for cheaper elsewhere,  buuuut oh well</li>
    <li> Maybe I just got a bad bottle, but this went on clumpy and uneven.  The brush also suffers from stray bristles.</li>
    <li> Love it! Bright white &amp; durable.&lt;br /&gt;Now I can retouch my french tip on my own 😊</li>
    <li> I bought the white nail polish, I like the fact the paint dries fast. The color is okay.</li>
    <li> This is not white nail polish it is cream colored and not white at all.  The description is wrong and the picture is miss leading as it appears to be white but in fact is a very brownish cream.  I have not used it as it is not the right color so I can not state what the quality of the polish is as to coverage or application.  It should never have been called white.</li>
    <li> The polish is more thick than thin, but it is perfect for doing a french nail at home! Clean white color, very bright, only need one coat.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good nail polish in itself, but when I received it, the brush bristles were twisted, and remain so, and they&#x27;re in a sort of spiral so that I can never get the paint to brush on in a straight line. It drives me crazy and I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;m only going to use this bottle for nail art that I can dip another, smaller and straight brush into. So if you&#x27;re thinking to use this for nail art, then fine, it&#x27;s a fair nail polish. But if you&#x27;re wanting solid nails of white, look elsewhere unless you want to end up with a 3 mm-thick coat of paint on top of your nails from the effort of getting it smooth before giving up. The brush is useless and I don&#x27;t know what to do about it.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the paint does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> Good white nail polish. Only needs 2 coats for complete coverage of the nail.  I&#x27;m glad that I bought it.</li>
    <li> I CANNOT STAND THIS BRAND!! IT IS A VERY GLOOPY THICK POLISH. NOT ONLY THAT BUT IT TAKES SOOOOO LONG TO DRY. AND IT SMELL TERRIBLE IT IS ONE OF THE SMELLIEST POLISHES I HAVE. JUST DONT BUY</li>
    <li> It was great and it got here before the estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> good quality excellent expectations. took alittle while to come tho( chose normal shipping) besides that it was a great product. will get more products of this brand. :)</li>
    <li> It did not last long. The polish chiped off in a day&#x27;s time. I would not want anyone to be disappointed like I was.</li>
    <li> it is very thick and usually covers for me in one coat.</li>
    <li> Really thick white nail polish. I added clear nail polish to make it not so thick. Otherwise good color to wear.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS ZOO WELL I LOVE I well only one problem every time I used it for dotting the dots would peel off</li>
    <li> Nice white but its a little thin. Provably should&#x27;ve chosen a different brand.</li>
    <li> I really love this this nail polish. It&#x27;s the best I EVER bought. It goes on smooth and drys super fast! I will totally buy this type again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s absolutely everything I hoped for and more plain and simple. But it smells like bad bubble gum though. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This nail polish is a lot better quality than what I expected. You need to do two coats of the color to make sure the polish is opaque. The consistency of the polish itself is great, I didn&#x27;t need to use nail polish thinner or anything. The brush that comes in the lid is easy to use and the lid is totally leak proof. The only thing that kept me from giving this nail polish 5 stars is that there isn&#x27;t as much polish in the container as I expected. I&#x27;ve used it about 5+ times and I&#x27;m almost out. However, I know exactly what I&#x27;m going to buy when I do run out!</li>
    <li> It has a good consistency and covers well. You may need two coats though. It also started chipping the next day after I put it on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really white , it&#x27;s cream. And I had to apply at least 10 layers on each nail for it to even look like I had anything on, way to watery . Also kinda looks like I painted my nails with white out</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. But you might need to use 2-3 layers of polish for the white to stand out. the top of the cap fell off so only the paint brush is on. Not very durable. the paint chips very easily without a top coat.</li>
    <li> I needed a white polish for stamping that wouldn&#x27;t break my bank. I decided to pick up silver, black and white from Kleancolor. All these colors work so well with stamping because they have a bit of a thicker formula. I&#x27;ve enjoyed using all of these colors for stamping nail designs.</li>
    <li> I love this so much!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a good white nail polish that you only have to put one coat on and it is white. This is totally the perfect one!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a base coat so the neon colors I use would pop and would need less coats. it works great. Dries pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Love it so much, it goes on nice but you will need at least two coats, but it&#x27;s a beautiful winter white color!</li>
    <li> Do not by. Did not dry all the way, would rub off even after waiting 30 minutes!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the color I wanted and I got it within 3 days of my order!!</li>
    <li> I messaged the seller about not receiving the correct color. So, I sent it back and again they gave me the wrong color. I am not sure if I like this item, since I never received the correct color (First they gave me yellow, than second a light pink color.) I got to keep the pink color, but I believe they said they wouldn&#x27;t return it for a second time. And I also got tired of the run around. So the pink color my child likes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use with nail art and it does a wonderful job of making the designs stand out. I give this product a 5***** STAR Rating because it works perfectly and makes my nails look beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definately would buy again :-)</li>
    <li> The Polish chips way too easily. It doesn&#x27;t stay on for too long.</li>
    <li> It came so fast! its also a good white, youll need about 2 thin coats its not watery though, its a good opaque white</li>
    <li> too white  looks like bandaids on my toes</li>
    <li> I love the color. This brand of nail polish do not strike when painting nails. I will be buying this product again. Thanks!</li>
