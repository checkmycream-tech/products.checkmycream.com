      <li>I&#x27;ll be posting a review on my youtube channel soon :)</li>
      <li>This is better quality than some of the palettes that I bought at sephora and had to return.</li>
      <li>two of the more neutral colors are matte...</li>
      <li>Most of the colors in this palette are shimmery rather than matte.</li>
      <li>Love this palette.</li>
      <li>I love Sleek Palettes.</li>
      <li>I am really enjoying this palette...</li>
      <li>Nice big mirror, so it is ideal for on-the-go touch ups.  </li>
      <li>I love this palette.</li>
      <li>I love these Sleek pallettes.  </li>
      <li>They are a bit lighter than the picture, and more flattering.</li>
      <li>looked absolutely stunning on me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m much more of a &amp;#34;natural</li>
      <li>but that is a shipping concern where they should have packed it with bubble wrap better and not at all about the palette itself.</li>
      <li>I just love it love</li>
      <li>Will be purchasing more of these palettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>with of course just a bit more for the matte colors.  </li>
      <li>I love, love, love my palette.  </li>
      <li>All the company could offer me was for me to spend more money to purchase another at 50% of the cost  when it was not my fault</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m definitely going to try more of these pressed minerals eyeshadow palettes as well as their trio blush palettes because I&#x27;m so impressed with this \\&quot;Storm\\&quot; palette!!</li>
      <li>If used with a primer, you&#x27;ll get a pretty good color.</li>
      <li>This was my very first Sleek palette and I am totally in love with it!</li>
      <li>The packaging is very nice for even a product of a $30 value, I would say it is true to the brand&#x27;s name and is very sleek and feels durable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really excited I purchased these :)</li>
      <li>I wish they sold these in America, but for now, I&#x27;m fine with purchasing on amazon.</li>
      <li>Good variety in colours and inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Cons: not the best pigmentation and does not last long</li>
      <li>But it is still a very lovely palette, I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I was fortunate enough to buy it for around $11 and that is great buy because sleek is a uk brand</li>
      <li>It arrived in just a bubble envelope, which I honestly don&#x27;t think is much protection.</li>
      <li>Overall great product.</li>
      <li>oh so cheap.</li>
      <li>more on the neutral/smoky side and no crazy colors.</li>
      <li>The colors are pigmented and so smooth they almost feel creamy.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be getting more, especially because of the great price!</li>
      <li>I got the storm palette and the oh so special palette</li>
      <li>This is by far the best make-up purchase I have made in a long time.  </li>
      <li>Good products for a MUA who is looking for a palettes instead of individual pots.</li>
      <li>I believe the time it took to get to me in FL was rather quick.</li>
      <li>I purchased the STORM palette from \\&quot;Lucky Girl\\&quot; and it took just about a week to be delivered from London.</li>
      <li>Colors are bold &amp; stand out.</li>
      <li>The black color is great for eye-liner alternative or to set liquid eye-liner.  </li>
      <li>When travelling, this is a good palette because it has some light colors and some dark.  </li>
      <li>They are so pretty!</li>
      <li>the eye shadow colors are so pretty!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The color pigmentation is fantastic, along the lines of MAC and Urban Decay. This is the only palette that I need along with Naked2 to recreate every look possible. I am tempted to purchase the Sleek iDivine OhSoSpecial palette from this brand as well. It has the coral and pink colors that look amazing in the summer season. With shipping, this palette isn&#x27;t as much of a &#x27;steal&#x27; as they brag about in Europe. However, I still find the price reasonable for the quality that you get over drugstore brands.</li>
    <li> I love sleek products! They are so pigmented and oh so cheap.</li>
    <li> Received the product early. Really like this eyeshadows palette. Some does smudged on my eyes, like the black one. Overall great product.</li>
    <li> Amazing palette. Loved Its Super pigmented eyeshadow!!!. Everyday looks or elegant for a special day.</li>
    <li> I completely recommend this seller RM Cosmetics! Not only did it arrive earlier than I expected but the quality is amazing I will definitely buy from this seller again and again! The colors are exactly like the pictures provided and I cant believe the consistency is similar to urban decay naked palettes.</li>
    <li> I love these shadows!  The staying power with or without a primer is amazing to me.  I own all the UD shadows and they don&#x27;t even hold this long (Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I LOVE UD!) I&#x27;m really excited I purchased these :)</li>
    <li> Much, much prettier than the pictures make it appear. The colors are shimmer or matte, and the shimmer is just the right amount. They are a bit lighter than the picture, and more flattering. I bought this palette on a whim as a gift, and I think I will be purchasing it for myself soon.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Vibrant colors that wear well. Pretty shimmer. Not too much fallout.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister in hopes that she would no longer steal my own palettes! She loved it. The eyeshadows are all very pigmented, the mirror is huge, and the packaging is pretty durable. It came wrapped in bubble wrap, and I got it within two weeks, even though I live in America. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price point - very comparable to higher end eyeshadows!  I use this as frequently as my Naked and Lorac palettes!</li>
    <li> This is great quality makeup, it lasts me all day and the colors are so pretty, and everyday wearable. I also love the packaging, good for on the go, and has a nice sized mirror. I just love it love it love it!</li>
    <li> This palette is not true to color. I only purchase this palette because of that bright blue, but that blue is not bight instead it&#x27;s a dark blue. Vey Disappointed!!!! Will not buy again. In addition,  palette was delivered physically broken and one of the eye shadow was shattered into pieces. All the company could offer me was for me to spend more money to purchase another at 50% of the cost  when it was not my fault and I just purchased three other palettes with them plus shipping.</li>
    <li> The colors are very vibrant, however the coverage is not the best. If used with a primer, you&#x27;ll get a pretty good color. Also when my palette arrived, one of the pans of eyeshadow was crushed and all over the place. I was pretty upset because this was supposed to be a gift for one of my friends. It arrived in just a bubble envelope, which I honestly don&#x27;t think is much protection.</li>
    <li> This was my very first Sleek palette and I am totally in love with it! The quality and pigmentation is A+!!! I was eyeing out this Storm one in particular for a few weeks before forking out on it and I do not regret it. The palette has 3 matte and 9 shimmery colors and they are so much more beautiful in person than in the picture TRUST ME! I have green eyes and every single color in this palette looked absolutely stunning on me. I am going to buy a few more palettes of Sleek in other shades and throw away all other eye shadows</li>
    <li> Amazing quality and pigmentation! The shadows are buttery and blendable! The price is equally as amazing. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> LOVE this palette! I take it with me when I travel! You can create a great day look and night look with this! I would definitely buy again! And the color pay off is GREAT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sad I can&#x27;t get Sleek products in the US but found it on amazon...amazing palette for its price with really nice pigmented colors, great nudes that can compete with the nude palette IMO (buying more expensive makeup doesn&#x27;t mean you apply it any better!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came nicely, seemingly unopened, in its little Sleek brand box but when I opened it, not sure what happened, there was a screw in the hinge completely missing. So now it only has one screw on the right hinge and doesn&#x27;t close properly and moves around when I try to use the mirror. :( So that&#x27;s that...guess I can&#x27;t take it traveling.</li>
    <li> Sleek palettes seldom disappoint. Beautiful colours, great pigmentation (i mean GREAT). Love this palette.</li>
    <li> I love Sleek Palettes. They are affordable and amazingly pigmented. The product was shipped form Europe and I believe I had it in a little over a week!</li>
    <li> I love this palette. I was fortunate enough to buy it for around $11 and that is great buy because sleek is a uk brand so basically I didn&#x27;t really have to pay shipping. But back to the palette... every shade is pigmented with no fall out. I love how many eye looks you can make with this with browns, gold, champagne, a shimmery pink. If you like neutral palettes with a few wearable colors of gunmetal, green, dark blue  thrown in I would get this! the only con is the matte brown broke a little while shipping but that is a shipping concern where they should have packed it with bubble wrap better and not at all about the palette itself. Oh and it can be a little hard to open the first couple times. It doesn&#x27;t really  open easily.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and perfect product</li>
    <li> Pigmentation: average&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: not all day wear, even with primer and setting spray&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: plastic and sturdy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Good variety in colours and inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Cons: not the best pigmentation and does not last long</li>
    <li> This palette has lovely colors, good saturation, nice variety and colors that compliment one another. I like the LARGE mirror and slim case. It&#x27;s a great buy! xox</li>
    <li> My first sleek palette, and it has EVERY color I want! I looked around forever, and I think this one is the best!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best make-up purchase I have made in a long time.  Love the colors... they are actually a bit lighter than they appear in the picture (not as intense!!! more subtle) and I was relieved to see that.  I&#x27;m much more of a &amp;#34;natural look&amp;#34; kind of girl.  You can go from a simple, pretty look to a more striking, dramatic look- all in one palette.  So happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> love this product the make up stays on all day ! its great</li>
    <li> this palette truly did not show up much with my dark brown eyes its ok</li>
    <li> I love these Sleek pallettes.  I have storm and sunset. They are so pigmented.</li>
    <li> This palette was recommended to me by a friend in London.  They sell Sleek in their drug stores in the UK and I had been wanting to try something for a while.  I LOVE neutrals, so this was ideal.  I had been wanting some greys as well for my collection.  The packaging rivals MAC or any other high end make-up brand.  Nice big mirror, so it is ideal for on-the-go touch ups.  When travelling, this is a good palette because it has some light colors and some dark.  It can be used for day and night looks.  The black color is great for eye-liner alternative or to set liquid eye-liner.  The brush is a typical sponge tip, but I just replaced it with a travel sized MAC brush from a set my husband bought me for my birthday.  The pigmentation is amazing and long-lasting.  Some are shimmer, some are matte.  A really great buy!</li>
    <li> I always research a product before I buy it, read reviews and look at swatches online; I researched this palette before purchasing. The packaging is very nice for even a product of a $30 value, I would say it is true to the brand&#x27;s name and is very sleek and feels durable. The palette comes in a cardboard box and mine was just thrown into a bubble mailer, so I had a broken eyeshadow in each of the two palettes I received. I believe mailing in a box with airbag filler or peanuts would prevent this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadows have a buttery texture that is much better than most drugstores level eyeshadows, but despite the texture I do not find these to be better than less costly pigmented shadows such as NYX, and a far cry from calling them just as good as high end shadows. I find the darker colors especially to appear more muddy than vibrant—the vibrant product photo is, in my opinion, a far cry from the actual shadows. The green, gray, blue and coppery shades all appear to be the same value or brightness, like they are the same color and just tinted slightly differently. That is to say, if I swatch the blue, green, and gray colors next to each other on my hand, there&#x27;s not much distinction, and upon swiping my finger over the swatches on my hand most of the color disappears and all that is left is a muddy tint. So you aren&#x27;t getting a lot of variation in this palette other than the two matte browns which I actually really like. The black is a decently opaque and dark black, but not superbly inky or black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price point I think this is a decent palette, the two matte browns are great, but as a whole the blues and greens are forgettable and lackluster, and even with a good solid primer from Nars or Urban Decay, they faded quickly.</li>
    <li> I Adore Thiss. The quality is amazing, it&#x27;s neutral but you could still make a smokey eye with the gem tones in the palette, and it&#x27;s affordable!!!! This is better quality than some of the palettes that I bought at sephora and had to return. The only con that I found is that they didn&#x27;t include a matte cream shade for highlight. If I were to take this to travel with I&#x27;d have to bring along a single eyeshadow. But it is still a very lovely palette, I highly recommend it. I&#x27;ll be posting a review on my youtube channel soon :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this palette, I use it everyday and for going out! I have blue eyes but it has colors that&#x27;s work work or any eye color!</li>
    <li> wooow the colors are gorgeous💘</li>
    <li> I love these eye shadows, very pigmented and long lasting on the eye.  This review is mainly for RM Cosmetics, they are based in the UK. I&#x27;ve ordered lots of the Sleek Makeup from RM Cosmetics, the customer service is great. All my items are shipped un-damaged, and in  timely fashion.</li>
    <li> These eyeshadows are beautiful, and they are some really great quality. I wish they sold these in America, but for now, I&#x27;m fine with purchasing on amazon. The price is also very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I love the colors. The pigments are vibrant and very soft to the skin and they go on very smooth. I get a lot of product on my brushes so i don&#x27;t have to use a lot. I own a few palettes by sleek and I have not been disappointed yet. Good products for a MUA who is looking for a palettes instead of individual pots.</li>
    <li> If you research this palette you will see how awesome it is. The color payoff is great, and I imagine that if you use a primer it&#x27;d be even better. Most of the colors in this palette are shimmery rather than matte. They last a long time, I bought this as a gift for a friend and she can&#x27;t stop raving about it. I even have the urge to buy another one, just for me.&lt;br /&gt;As far as packaging and shipping goes- that was also well. The palette comes inside it&#x27;s own box wrapped around in bubble wrap and that is put inside an envelope. Even though it is coming from UK I believe the time it took to get to me in FL was rather quick. Sleek just seems like a great cheap makeup brand.</li>
    <li> Colors are bold &amp; stand out. The shadows can all be matched. There is a lot of shimmer &amp; also a couple of matte. It&#x27;s the best of both worlds! The seller delivered befored the estimated date! Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> I got the storm palette and the oh so special palette and I&#x27;m so glad I did! The colors are great and they are so opaque! I will definitely be getting more, especially because of the great price!</li>
    <li> I love this palette! the eye shadow colors are so pretty! they go on nice and stay on all day!</li>
    <li> I love the colors! They are so pretty! This arrived a lot sooner than anticipated which was also very nice!</li>
    <li> I purchased the STORM palette from \\&quot;Lucky Girl\\&quot; and it took just about a week to be delivered from London. My palette arrived very well wrapped in bubble wrap inside a padded envelope and was fully intact. The colors are extremely pigmented with a metallic texture to most of the eyeshadows...two of the more neutral colors are matte...and although I usually don&#x27;t care for lots of \\&quot;glitter-shimmer\\&quot; in my eyeshadows, a few taps of my brushes gets rid of most of the mica glitter with these eyeshadows so that I&#x27;m left with more of a \\&quot;sheen\\&quot; of colors rather than full-on metallic. The pans are smaller than the 26mm pans that I&#x27;m used to...these eyeshadow pans are just a bit larger than the size of a nickel, but the color payoff is fantastic, so only a small dip with your brushes is needed to apply/blend them beautifully...with of course just a bit more for the matte colors.  I&#x27;ve never tried anything from Sleek cosmetics before this purchase...but I&#x27;m definitely going to try more of these pressed minerals eyeshadow palettes as well as their trio blush palettes because I&#x27;m so impressed with this \\&quot;Storm\\&quot; palette!! Hands down....some of the best pigmented eyeshadows that I&#x27;ve tried in a very long time from a brand other than my usual ones.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love my palette.  I chose this rating because it is a great product. The colors are beautiful and apply easily.  This is definitely a must buy for makeup lovers and make up artist everywhere.  Will be purchasing more of these palettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to friends and family. Thanks</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow palette is wonderful! The colors are pigmented and so smooth they almost feel creamy. The downside to this texture is that does produce fallout, so be aware. It&#x27;s a shame Sleek cosmetic products are not sold in the U.S. it really is an affordable and quality product, although ordering from the UK makes it slightly less affordable. I am really enjoying this palette...more on the neutral/smoky side and no crazy colors. I do plan on ordering more Sleek palettes in the near future. The seller was excellent with pkg arriving earlier than anticipated and very safely shipped in bubble mailer. I am thoroughly pleased!</li>
    <li> Took a chance on this palette, and am very pleased with it. Colors are very pigmented, and last all day without creasing or smudging. Will purchase again!</li>
