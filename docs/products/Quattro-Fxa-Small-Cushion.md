      <li>I have bought several thru amazon they are great.  </li>

      <li>Also if you don&#x27;t clean the cushion often , I find it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
      <li>Quick delivery and fits my small resmed mask perfectly!!</li>

      <li>It is not a good fit for the standard frame.  </li>

    <li> Worked perfect. Great product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Fits my C-Pap perfectly.  This was a godsend!  My insurance covers a new cushion every 3 months - I need one in about half of that time.</li>
    <li> Low rating because we needed to return it.  It was not the cushion we thought we were ordering, though we used the correct part number in relation to my wife&#x27;s c-pap machine and equipment.  Had to pay out of our own pocket to ship it back...haven&#x27;t yet heard if we will be refunded.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and fits my small resmed mask perfectly!!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this online at a much better price than the medical supply store.  It was exactly the right fit.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this mask for several years, so I thought I would order the replacement parts independently.  This cushion will not stay in place overnight.  It constantly pulls out of the frame, causing airblasts me in the face.  It is not a good fit for the standard frame.  I cannot get rest.  This is a bad buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice being able to replace a part of system instead of buying the whole head piece. However, it was kind of expensive for what it is. I haven&#x27;t priced around but it seemed pricey.&lt;br /&gt;Service was great.</li>
    <li> This is as described.  It fit perfectly and sealed wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Was in dire need of supplies after my company for supplies lost their bid to accept our insurance and never told us. I may of had to pay out of pocket but at least it came quick and now i can sleep again.</li>
    <li> I have a bi-pap - similar to a c-pap for sleep apnea.  I have lung infections and use my machine all the time.  I love this product as it&#x27;s compfortable, stays in place and easy to order.  THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> I order from here before and like the nasal cushion so why not again it a good product . Also I got it when promise . I will tell my sister about and my friends that need one . I will order again</li>
    <li> Just got my cushion from the PO Box.  Was immediately not happy with how it was packaged.  Have ordered from Amazon before but for a different mask and it came in a box.. This is a very light weight plastic. It has to adhere to your face for complete suction and cannot have any gaps or you will be awake all night moving around trying to get the correct flow from your CPAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEEDS TO BE MAILED IN A CARDBOARD BOX/</li>
    <li> This mask came on time and was exactly what they said. Brand new, and the right size. I am very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Less expensive than when I bought it from my doctor.  Same quality, less cost!</li>
    <li> I have bought several thru amazon they are great.  There are several comments on air leakage.  It is not the cushion-the solution that is needed you need to TIGHTEN you mask straps.  Also if you don&#x27;t clean the cushion often , I find it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  I use vinegar &amp;baby shampoo. And yes you should trade them out at least every 3months if not sooner. The straps every 6 months, they stretch out.  Also I just figured out the Quattro mirage does not fit the Quattro fx-that is what I messed up on. Just double check your order. Also nice not to have to deal with the insurances.  Bless you Amazon for making these available.</li>
    <li> Works fairly well,except, for those of us who have a very narrow bridge.  I got small air leaks around the bridge of my nose.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about this product. It fits my mask and is high quality. It was shipped promptly and arrived without any damage or other problems. If you use a CPAP mask that this cushion fits then it&#x27;s a fine purchase.</li>
    <li> Fits the mask perfectly.  Gives a real good seal.</li>
    <li> This cushion was at least as good as the one that came with the machine.  I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I was sent the cushion for the Quattro Pro, not the one I ordered.  There was no paper work and no information about returns or exchanges. Wasted time and money.</li>
    <li> I received the product within the time you specified. The product received was the correct item that I purchased.. I was glad to be able to find this product, with a reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed now that insurance doesn&#x27;t cover more than one a year</li>
