      <li>Love love love this product</li>
      <li>But for some reason my hair is now a more curly texture even after being relaxed.</li>
      <li>I have tried alot, and even thought about not using a balm because that&#x27;s what most naturals say to do, but my hair LOVES a goooood balm.</li>
      <li>and I love the results.</li>
      <li>OK, I like this product.</li>
      <li>With more hair I needed a thicker balm that was still giving me the growing power.</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m not 100% sure of the DHT blocking properties, I do like the feeling I get (probably from the menthol)</li>
      <li>i was expecting a more nutrient based product, basically this product feels like running vasoline with mint through your hair.</li>
      <li>but im sure its doing something</li>
      <li>I love the way it tingles when it gets in your scalp.</li>
      <li>I have to take some medicine and sleep for almost three hours to get better.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff</li>
      <li>tingles for about 1 or more hours love this stuff,not sure if its making my hair grow i have braids</li>
      <li>Omg i love how this product makes my scalp tingle my scalp  </li>
      <li>but I am satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>If you use shampoo, conditioner and hairdress you will love you hair.</li>
      <li>I see that my sides are growing and the top of my head is getting thicker and fuller.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m okay with the smell</li>
      <li>I have tried many products which claimed they would help with hair growth to no avail.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mostly Vaseline...  </li>
      <li>Using the Groganics system on a daily basis produces the best results!  </li>
      <li>Really works!!!!</li>
      <li>It makes your health healthy and strong.</li>
      <li>this product makes my scalp feel nice and tingly, like a breath of fresh air.</li>
      <li>I starting using it it has a nice odor and feels good</li>
      <li>I mircobraid my hair 3 years ago and lost my hairline, But GRO-N-wild is helping my hair to grow back beautiful</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel very soft and moisturized which I guess is why its so good with anti-breakage.</li>
      <li>Like this product it does what it said I enjoy use it</li>
      <li>So far it has been good.  </li>
      <li>This is a really great product to use if you have dry itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to wear my real hair in over 4 years</li>
      <li>The tingle from the menthol really hit the spot, but I do wish that it softened better.</li>
      <li>Definitely soothes the scalp, feels really good, like putting vapor rub on your scalp, the feeling, and scent.</li>
      <li>I was getting a quick weave on my hair and when I removed the quick weaves I was surprised at the amount of new growth that I experienced.</li>
      <li>I could see it being a good fit only for someone who is completely bald.</li>
      <li>These are fantastic products, I will most definitely order again.</li>
      <li>I have had some success with all of those products, but never have I seen hair regrowth.      </li>
      <li>; it was just thin &amp; I experienced a lot of shedding, so I cut it to my shoulders to even it out &amp; have healthy ends, etc...  </li>
      <li>The ad description doesn&#x27;t mention that this product contains mineral oil, petroleum, DMDMHydantoin and Methyl Paraben ingredients which eventually reap havoc on skin and hair and are unsafe when absorbed through the skin.    </li>
      <li>2 stars for the nice tingle when massaged in, but I would have to shampoo my hair before making any public appearances!</li>
      <li>overall, nice smell and not greasy</li>
      <li>it &#x27;behaves&#x27; - I normally wrap my hair at nights and using this oil makes my hair wrap easily and falls into place.</li>
      <li>Hair not dry and brittle any more.</li>
      <li>Great for african american hair.</li>
      <li>I actually mix this with my coconut oil (very little oil) and it works great!</li>
      <li>This is also my first time using this product.</li>
      <li>I would more than likely order from pharmapacks again.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;m stuck with it, I think I&#x27;ll try to make the most of it by using it immediately prior to shampooing.</li>
      <li>Love the product for using it for only two months my hair has grown and</li>
      <li>And as I stated in my earlier review that everything don&#x27;t always work for everyone but I can truthfully say that this has been, and still is a blessing to me in my efforts to  regrow my hair.</li>
      <li>it is working pretty well</li>
      <li>it takes a while to  see some change, but hair more manageable, no hair left in comb when i comb it</li>
      <li>, in fact I was could for the first time in over a year  use foam rollers  </li>
      <li>When I first started using this product 4 months ago my hair was about to the bottom of my collar.</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice the difference, but when I started using the Groganics DHT freeze shampoo and conditioner along with the Gro-N-Wild, I noticed rapid improvement.  </li>
      <li>You will feel this for the first 30mins.</li>
      <li>There is a fine line however, if you over do it and not wash your hair frequently enough it can leave you feeling, well, &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; for lack of a better word.&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to my next point about this product.</li>
      <li>i go to bed while tinges on my scalp)this way happen to give a good results and notice a feel on my scalp when touch and it as grow my hair 2 inch past 3 months)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like rubbing Vick&#x27;s vapor run all over your head, maybe not quite that intense</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working or not</li>
      <li>one of the product that i can really see results on my hair..</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>Made hair very greasy.</li>
      <li>My hair is much thicker.</li>
      <li>Very greesy.</li>
      <li>This stuff really really works.</li>
      <li>Very please with the product it help my hair to grow and thicken up like</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Groganics!</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t get that this is supposed to make your hair grow.</li>
      <li>i really like this product.</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen any real growth from this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to work for me. Only used it before wash days now I hardly use it at all. Will not purchase again</li>
    <li> it takes a while to  see some change, but hair more manageable, no hair left in comb when i comb it i will definitely use  this product again</li>
    <li> Great product that works.  I cut my hair the other day it was really short - I had to use the smallest curling iron to curl it.  Anyways, I started using groganics DHT blocker oil twice a week to oil my scalp and rub on my hair.  It makes the scalp tingly - i guess u can describe it as - like iced cold water dumped on your head.  You will feel this for the first 30mins. It has been over a month now and my hair has grown about 3/4 of an inch and it is thicker and it &#x27;behaves&#x27; - I normally wrap my hair at nights and using this oil makes my hair wrap easily and falls into place. I highly recommend!  I only have this oil, soon I will get shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> let my hair grow like crazy</li>
    <li> This is also my first time using this product.</li>
    <li> Seen a little progress</li>
    <li> This makes you hair soooooo greasy. If people have thin hair why would they want to add something greasy to make it look thinner. Even when you use it at night time the next day you hair is greasy and the pillow. I had to wach my hair with baking soda to get this stuff out.</li>
    <li> This product does make your scalp feel good.  I will keep using it to see if it provides good hair growth.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom after cancer . She swears by it and her hair has definitely grown a lot.</li>
    <li> What is this stuff??? It&#x27;s gross on the hair and does not come out with washing the hair! I really don&#x27;t get that this is supposed to make your hair grow.</li>
    <li> i dont know if it work but am keep trying</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year  and I love the results. My hair is much thicker.</li>
    <li> Great product an was delivered on time Really works!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the product for using it for only two months my hair has grown and it now thich than before. i will continue to use it. my edges have also grown. im going to purchase, the all pack of this product. one of the product that i can really see results on my hair..</li>
    <li> I am a Black female who relaxes her hair. When I first started using this product 4 months ago my hair was about to the bottom of my collar. Now my hair is almost to my  bra strap. My scalp is no longer extremely sensitive and I do not have any stress related bald spots any more. My hair grow quicker and longer than it has ever grown before, so get this it works. Use it everyday and you will be  amazed.</li>
    <li> Using this with the on-the-spot liquid and yes I can say that I am seeing less hair loss.  I am really hoping to see new hair growth with possible thickening.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I actually mix this with my coconut oil (very little oil) and it works great!</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this 0 stars. I used this one time, applied at night and couldn&#x27;t wash it out of my hair the next day. Like other 1 star reviews it left my hair greasy and weighed down. Horrible product!</li>
    <li> I use this product every other day and it brings a healthy shine and glow to my hair. It make my scalp feel good.</li>
    <li> It stinks. If you want to smell like vapor rub and have greasy hair from petroleum jelly, this is the product.</li>
    <li> I starting using it it has a nice odor and feels good but I&#x27;m going to keep trying it hope it works</li>
    <li> No good at all. Very greesy. Had to trash it after one application. Total wasted of money.</li>
    <li> Like this product it does what it said I enjoy use it I like the smell of it is a good product</li>
    <li> Was balding and now there is growth ... best purchase I ever made online.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> a little stickly but I can have grown hair again in spot that is thinner again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my hair was thinning all over. Lots of breakage when combing was troublesome. After using the product for about one month I noticed my relaxer was reversed. I stopped using the product then got a relaxer. Wow! My hair continues to thicken and grow. This product is amazing. Unfortunately I could not continue using it. When I decide to go natural again I will use this product.</li>
    <li> This I only use at night because it has a medicine smell. I&#x27;m okay with the smell but I haven&#x27;t seen any real growth from this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s mostly Vaseline...  it stinks.  It said apply and style as usual.  No way you can style your hair with this in it.</li>
    <li> To my surprise, the product works! I say to my surprise because I have tried every thing on the market. Ladies you have to find what works for you. Not every thing works for everybody. You must also eat fruit, vegetables and drink water.&lt;br /&gt;I started 2 months ago - hair has grown 1.5 to 2 inches. That&#x27; s a lot for me.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair a dirty grease slick.</li>
    <li> Product advertisement did not state that the Hair Gro-n-Wild is ORANGE in color. The seller suggested that I had personally changed the color. I finally had to mail the product back to the seller at my own expense.  What a drag!&lt;br /&gt;Footnote:  All hair, especially gray hair, cannot withstand hair products which are pink, orange, etc. Gray hair picks up these colors and it is difficult to remove the &amp;#34;stains&amp;#34;.  Sales information re: hair products would eliminate what can become ugly situations.</li>
    <li> i was expecting a more nutrient based product, basically this product feels like running vasoline with mint through your hair.</li>
    <li> this reminds me of VICKS vapor rub. (the smell, texture, consistancy) it takes a few washings to get the product out of your hair.  so if you like greasy face and pillow HERE YOU GO. i will use it in replace of hair wax. my hair cannot absorb all that grease, its not for me. I have long silky latina hair similar to Salma hyack.</li>
    <li> Did not like at all.  Made hair very greasy.</li>
    <li> Good for hair growth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product it I must say that it works really great..But for some reason my hair is now a more curly texture even after being relaxed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle product, already see results on hair growth in bald spots within a month use. I wonder if I keep using how far it can go, time will tell</li>
    <li> No new hair yet , undecided .</li>
    <li> Awful product!! It took the edges of my hair out!!! This stuff is highly potent and dangerous!! I can&#x27;t even wear a pony tail, now!! I will never ever buy from here again!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, and it was on time. I would more than likely order from pharmapacks again.</li>
    <li> i am 25 bfemale relaxed hair. this as work for me because i have very dry scalp and thin skin layer  and to say so when touch my skin in my head when poke i don&#x27;t feel it which raise a thought for me something wrong with my scalp and my hair always thin/dry never grows past my ears.so try this product like this for affective results ( apart my hair in two section and i use small amount all over my scalp i place plastic wrap on and scarf i go to bed while tinges on my scalp)this way happen to give a good results and notice a feel on my scalp when touch and it as grow my hair 2 inch past 3 months) hopefully it helps you............</li>
    <li> After a month of use, my hair grow in places that did not have hair for over 20 years. Great product for all the needs stated thereon. It works.</li>
    <li> I just started using Grow n Wild last week and I&#x27;m just praying that it works for me too. I haven&#x27;t been able to wear my real hair in over 4 years and I am sick of the weave. I love the way it tingles when it gets in your scalp. And I&#x27;m hoping that tingle means its going to work...</li>
    <li> It is to early to tell.I have only been using it for 2 weeks now.</li>
    <li> Hair growth seen in two weeks time!</li>
    <li> THIS IS LIKE A MIRACLE DRUG FOR YOUR SCALP TO MAKE YOUR DAMANGED HAIR GROW! YOU WILL FEEL A TINGLING TO LET YOU KNOW ITS WORKING!</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my mother, and she is a very big fan of this product.</li>
    <li> One of my friends recommended this product. His hair was also thinning at the crown the head. He started using and in 2 weeks from the start date he got great results. As for me, I saw results within 4 days of applying this to my head. May seem unreal but friends and family have told me that my hair is growing back. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to other. Hope it works for the next consumer/customer.</li>
    <li> its making my hair grow like trees. its great.</li>
    <li> This product has a medicinal smell to it.  I really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working or not and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month.  My hair is the same length and has not thickened.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product to use if you have dry itchy scalp. It soothes you scalp and minimizes the dryness. If you use shampoo, conditioner and hairdress you will love you hair.</li>
    <li> Really had my scalp tingling but it made my hair feel HARD &amp; COARSE!! Not sure if it grew or not?</li>
    <li> I was using Therapy G which I think helped with hair thickness.  But I started using Groganics Gro-N-Wild because my hair stylist recommended it. At first I didn&#x27;t notice the difference, but when I started using the Groganics DHT freeze shampoo and conditioner along with the Gro-N-Wild, I noticed rapid improvement.  I have had a thinning problem for the last 10 years and have tried everything.  Other products I have tried, Nioxin, castor oil, Nature&#x27;s Blessing, and other products that claim to improve thickness.  I have had some success with all of those products, but never have I seen hair regrowth.      Well, I am sticking with the Groganics system until my scalp fully recovers, then I will use the system once weekly for maintenence.</li>
    <li> I have been using the entire Groganics hair system for about 3 weeks &amp; I&#x27;m amazed!  My hair definitely does not shed like it was; regular shedding &amp; not much at all!  My hair is STRONGER, thicker, fuller, &amp; I have a lot of new growth ( I haven&#x27;t measured yet, I&#x27;m going to wait about 2 months).  The \\&quot;freeze\\&quot; shampoos &amp; conditioner also works wonders &amp; leaves your hair SOFT!  Using the Groganics system on a daily basis produces the best results!  I wash &amp; deep condition my hair twice a week as some of the daily hair products are a bit oily, however they do show RESULTS!  I also use the vitamins, but I only take one a day as my hair does grow rapidly; it was just thin &amp; I experienced a lot of shedding, so I cut it to my shoulders to even it out &amp; have healthy ends, etc...  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Groganics!</li>
    <li> I purchased the hair gro n wild along with the shampoo and conditioner in September 2013 I was getting a quick weave on my hair and when I removed the quick weaves I was surprised at the amount of new growth that I experienced. I have tried many products which claimed they would help with hair growth to no avail.  My hair started thinning in the top of my scalp and my hair was pulled out on the sides from wearing braids that were too tight. I see that my sides are growing and the top of my head is getting thicker and fuller. I have been recommending this product to everyone that I know who is experiencing hair loss. The only draw back is it is greasy and has strong smell, which seems to only last for a few hours after application.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the shampoo and I do take a biotin supplement and my hair is night and day compared to January of this year.  For the price, it&#x27;s a must try.</li>
    <li> it is working pretty well</li>
    <li> Buyer BEWARE! The ad description doesn&#x27;t mention that this product contains mineral oil, petroleum, DMDMHydantoin and Methyl Paraben ingredients which eventually reap havoc on skin and hair and are unsafe when absorbed through the skin.    A safer product to use is Brahmi Oil - Ayurvedic Hair Growth massage oil.</li>
    <li> my hair grew a lot when using this product</li>
    <li> Not really sure yet, only been a couple weeks but im optimistic</li>
    <li> used for a couple months now. can&#x27;t say that there is any new hair growth, but existing hair seems thicker and healthier. also seems that less hair coming out when coming, etc so that&#x27;s good. overall, nice smell and not greasy (the oil based version is like putting bacon grease on your hair so beware).</li>
    <li> This product is incredibly thick like Vaseline/petroleum jelly with Vicks/vapor rub. It is very hard to wash out of hair but it does leave your hair shiny and soft after shampooing it out well. If you don&#x27;t take the time to shampoo twice to get this stuff out of your hair, it leaves your hair looking greasy and very heavy. I did have new growth of hair after a month and it stopped hair loss after a few days of using it. It helps very well with dry scalp as well. I used it once a week and left it on for 8 hours. I&#x27;m in my early 20s, female, and started having thinning hair after my pregnancy so this product helped.</li>
    <li> Currently using with another product. It has been about 2 months thicker hair no new growth yet. I feel it tingling.</li>
    <li> i really like this product. and I plan to buy it again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it does what it says it will because I stopped using it after a couple applications. It stinks and makes my hair look like I put crisco in it. When I washed my hair it wouldn&#x27;t wash out. I only used about a dime sized amount each time.</li>
    <li> Very please with the product it help my hair to grow and thicken up like I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;My hair dresser even notice the difference.</li>
    <li> Product changed the texture of my hair.....not pleased</li>
    <li> Omg i love how this product makes my scalp tingle my scalp  tingles for about 1 or more hours love this stuff,not sure if its making my hair grow i have braids but im sure its doing something</li>
    <li> I have had this only for about 2 weeks. Seems to help, getting a few new hairs, little early to tell how well this product works. Definitely soothes the scalp, feels really good, like putting vapor rub on your scalp, the feeling, and scent. Just for your information been using this with Groganics shampoo, seems like this compliments the shampoo, working together. Will update over time as to the effectiveness of this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my hair was thinning around the edges after a few weeks of using I saw an improvement in my hair</li>
    <li> This product is good, The smell can be considered strong but after using for 3 weeks hair is stronger.  I will recommend this product and continue to use.</li>
    <li> I give it a five star rating</li>
    <li> This along with the rest of the Groganics family is wonderful! The tingle from the menthol really hit the spot, but I do wish that it softened better. Still, it&#x27;s a great trade off.</li>
    <li> Great product. Definitely a DHT blocker. Hair started growing immediately. Have nice grade of hair now around the edges which majority has filled in. Hair not dry and brittle any more. Very happy I found this product on Amazon by searching DHT blockers and reading the helpful reviews. Great for african american hair.</li>
    <li> Was like putting Vaseline in your hair. Could not use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now. While I&#x27;m not 100% sure of the DHT blocking properties, I do like the feeling I get (probably from the menthol) and I do think it does a semi decent job at holding my hair in place. I tend to use a small bit in the morning, then a larger amount before bed. I am also using 5% minoxidil, and I have not had problems applying both at the same time. All in all I don&#x27;t think there is anything negative about purchasing this item to block DHT.</li>
    <li> I got turned on to this by a sample.....it feels so good on my scalp. It makes my hair feel so soft. I was so impressed that I wanted to see if it would help my hair to grow!</li>
    <li> Stimulates the scalp feels like it&#x27;s working.  Helps the itch.  It appears to be greasy but it actually absorbs really well.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Have used this product for several years. It really works.</li>
    <li> it seems to be working my hair  and scalp is not so dry.</li>
    <li> this product makes my scalp feel nice and tingly, like a breath of fresh air. Love this stuff i&#x27;ll keep watching to see how it works on my hair.</li>
    <li> I started using Groganics products in February of 2014 I love these products I left a review about the Head Full of Hair along with the other groganics products that I purchased earlier and my hair has since  grown at least six inches or more, in fact I was could for the first time in over a year  use foam rollers  I was amazed and so thankful I sent pics to my daughter and she was even surprised to see the progress that has taken place since I started with the products. I have a son who uses them as well and he loves the products  it has given new life to his hair. I hope that this review is helpful to someone who is looking for help with the regrowth and or repair of their damaged hair. And as I stated in my earlier review that everything don&#x27;t always work for everyone but I can truthfully say that this has been, and still is a blessing to me in my efforts to  regrow my hair.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for one week and notice a big improvement on slowing breaking of my hair</li>
    <li> These are fantastic products, I will most definitely order again.</li>
    <li> So far it has been good.  I need at least six months to really see the results. I do see new growth , and the itchy scalp is under control.</li>
    <li> This stuff really really works. I use it and you see results really fast. You can also mix it with profective for hair growth and that dual is the bomb.com</li>
    <li> OK, I like this product. I started using the shampoo and the conditioner. I find the \\&quot;On the spot\\&quot; product of Groganics useless. I stopped using the \\&quot;Head full of hair\\&quot; because it used to make my hair look dirty after it had dried. I then switched to the \\&quot;Hair Gro-n-Wild.\\&quot; this product really works. My hair is growing fast.&lt;br /&gt;The problem that I have with this product is that every time I use it, I have a terrible headache that follows. Believe me, when I say \\&quot;terrible\\&quot; I mean it. I have to take some medicine and sleep for almost three hours to get better. I am not sure I will keep using it. I don&#x27;t know it is is because of the blood flow, but it&#x27;s a horrible feeling.</li>
    <li> The product delivered the service intended, I have even recommeded and purchased the products as gifts to friends and also purchased to product for other family members.</li>
    <li> very good product, made very well. It makes your health healthy and strong. I haven&#x27;t used it that long but I am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I have found this product to be good at lessening my hair breakage but I cant tell yet if it&#x27;s doing anything to regrow my hair. I am not a fan of the tingle that it leaves on my scalp, I&#x27;m not sure what the point of that is, seems to me it could perform just the same if that ingredient (whatever it is) were left out. It&#x27;s like rubbing Vick&#x27;s vapor run all over your head, maybe not quite that intense but you get my basic point. I give it extra points for its softening ability too. It makes my hair feel very soft and moisturized which I guess is why its so good with anti-breakage. There is a fine line however, if you over do it and not wash your hair frequently enough it can leave you feeling, well, &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; for lack of a better word.&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to my next point about this product. I hope no one will find this comment offensive, my only goal is to be informative. I&#x27;m not sure who is considering using this product but let me tell you it is a grease/oil based item. The label says &amp;#34;system, treatment&amp;#34; etc. and &amp;#34;ethic&amp;#34; people intentionally (or used to) apply grease based products to our hair and scalp while other nationalities cant stand a greasy scalp hence the daily washing, so this product is not for everyone. I understand though that there are other formulas such as drops and I don&#x27;t know what the base ingredient in it is but that may be the way to go if you don&#x27;t want to apply greasy products. The 6 ounce jar if used gingerly as I do should last you a while too.</li>
    <li> I have been natural for about 6 months with 4b/c hair. THERES ALOT OF IT! But when I started school I noticed that my edges started thinning because of life&#x27;s stresses... SADNESS!!! But after going to the doctor and using vitamin E I began to see growth. With more hair I needed a thicker balm that was still giving me the growing power. I have tried alot, and even thought about not using a balm because that&#x27;s what most naturals say to do, but my hair LOVES a goooood balm. It makes my scalp tingle and my hair is better than ever!</li>
    <li> What a shame and disappointment - I might as well rub Vicks Vapo&#x27;rub&lt;br /&gt;into my hair. I love the tingle, but truly nothing about this thick, sticky, greasy vasoline-textured salve feels like it should be a leave-on product. I could see it being a good fit only for someone who is completely bald. Since I&#x27;m stuck with it, I think I&#x27;ll try to make the most of it by using it immediately prior to shampooing. 2 stars for the nice tingle when massaged in, but I would have to shampoo my hair before making any public appearances!</li>
    <li> IT MAKES MY HAIR SOFT AND TIGGLES WHEN YOU PUT IT ON.I HAVE SEEN SOME GROWTH SINCE I STARTED USING THESE PRODUCTS.WILL KEEP YOU POSTED.</li>
    <li> I mircobraid my hair 3 years ago and lost my hairline, But GRO-N-wild is helping my hair to grow back beautiful</li>
