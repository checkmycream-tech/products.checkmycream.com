      <li>, the scent coming out of the bottle is pleasant but doesn&#x27;t leave the scent on your skin...  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is light and very pleasant.  </li>
      <li>I paired this with the Olay In-Shower Lotion and was completely satisfied with the results!</li>

      <li>I love the silky feeling on skin after bath.</li>
      <li>LOOK HEALTHY</li>
      <li>I used to love the Shea butter ribbons body wash</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed okay products for decades...</li>
      <li>but it just made my skin brighter which i love the most.</li>
      <li>I am 34 and most of my friends say i look</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I never break out on this, and instead it keep my skin moisturised the whole day and feeling clean and bright.</li>
      <li>I could accurately feel the moisture all day.</li>
      <li>Leaves a feeling of light moisturizer on skin after light towel drying and no need for skin lotion.</li>
      <li>Great for dry skin.</li>

      <li>Love this product and hope they will continue selling this for a long period of time :)&lt;</li>
      <li>This leaves my skin soft and smooth and it smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite - in another review for a variation on this product a woman wrote it made her tub slippery</li>
      <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>My skin is definitely softer to the touch, no problems with dryness (I haven&#x27;t even needed lotion), and more elastic.</li>
      <li>, it does exactly what it says it does</li>
      <li>this is my favorite body wash,so going to buy the larger size in the double pack.will stick to amazon..absolutely love amazon prime.</li>
      <li>I have used several body wash products - many of which were organic lines.</li>
      <li>I am 60 and find many of the Olay Regenerist and Total Effects (inc.</li>
      <li>So many product brands that I have tried, were overly scented and did nothing to help my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>My skin is now so much &amp;#34;less itchy&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>with Olay Total Effects Advanced....  </li>
      <li>Really like it.</li>
      <li>the Definity line) to be far better than either the organic lines I have used or the pricey dept store lines - such as Lancome.</li>
      <li>states that she highly recommends this body wash for quality</li>
      <li>I see and feel a definite improvement and fewer skin issues which were mostly caused by dry skin irritation.</li>
      <li>Just after 2 days of using, I instantly saw the diffirence right away...</li>
      <li>so I order a two pack from Amazon, free Prime shipping, and that brings the per unit cost down to about 7.00 dollars.</li>
      <li>This product makes my skin so soft</li>
      <li>I am 60 years old</li>
      <li>As far as the anti-aging claims, however, I have not seen any resuts.  </li>
      <li>It is thick and creamy and leaves skin very soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I love Olay Total Effects, but the price was as much as the larger 15 oz bottle, so not a good deal at all.</li>
      <li>But it does not irritate my sensitive skin and regular use</li>
      <li>I have a very dry and sensitive skin and this is by far the ONLY product that works on my skin type.</li>
      <li>You can get it so much cheaper at (Walmart or Target) which they always have on their shelves for 30-40% less.</li>

<li> It does not leave your skin dry, does not leave your skin oily</li>
<li> because my skin is just so very dry.</li>
<li> USED TO HAVE VERY DRY SKIN ON MY FOREARMS,</li>
<li> I have very dry skin</li>
<li> DUE TO MY YEARS OUT</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s pretty expensive.</li>
<li> It is not at all drying like alot of other body washes.</li>
<li> but it also tends to just sit on your skin, when its humid you feel a little sticky and sadly I still have to put lotion on after I shower even after using this, but I will continue to use this as its comparable to what the body butter ribbons body wash used to be before they changed it.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed okay products for decades...I love the silky feeling on skin after bath.</li>
    <li> I love this product however it&#x27;s cheaper at Rite Aid.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing body wash. I have very dry skin and I definitely require body lotion after this body wash. But it does not irritate my sensitive skin and regular use has given my skin a smother appearance.</li>
    <li> THIS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT, WAS A GREAT PRICE BUT I THINK THE SHIPPING IS WAY TOO HIGH.OROBABLY WON&#x27;T ORDER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Love this body wash.  It has a pleasant scent and makes my skin look radiant. It is not at all drying like alot of other body washes.</li>
    <li> I have used several body wash products - many of which were organic lines. This is by far my favorite - in another review for a variation on this product a woman wrote it made her tub slippery - I have not seen any evidense of that. My skin is definitely softer to the touch, no problems with dryness (I haven&#x27;t even needed lotion), and more elastic. I see and feel a definite improvement and fewer skin issues which were mostly caused by dry skin irritation. I am 60 and find many of the Olay Regenerist and Total Effects (inc. the Definity line) to be far better than either the organic lines I have used or the pricey dept store lines - such as Lancome.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love how this product feels: both in and out of the shower.  As far as the anti-aging claims, however, I have not seen any resuts.  If cost is not a concern, there is no comparison; if cost is a concern, there are many other products nearly as good (including the Olay Ribbons Line).</li>
    <li> I use this with exfoliating gloves daily instead of a loofa.  It does not leave your skin dry, does not leave your skin oily, the scent coming out of the bottle is pleasant but doesn&#x27;t leave the scent on your skin...  It&#x27;s really nice.  I don&#x27;t know how &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; it is but it&#x27;s a great body wash anyway.</li>
    <li> This leaves my skin soft and smooth and it smells fantastic. I&#x27;ve had several people complement me on the scent. Love it.</li>
    <li> I used to love the Shea butter ribbons body wash but recently its not what it used to be so I tried this, it does exactly what it says it does but it also tends to just sit on your skin, when its humid you feel a little sticky and sadly I still have to put lotion on after I shower even after using this, but I will continue to use this as its comparable to what the body butter ribbons body wash used to be before they changed it.</li>
    <li> USED TO HAVE VERY DRY SKIN ON MY FOREARMS, DUE TO MY YEARS OUT BOATING IN FLORIDA&lt;br /&gt;.MY SKIN WAS CONSTATLY BLEADING FROM ANY MINOR SCRATH&lt;br /&gt;NOW MY FOREARMS  LOOK HEALTHY</li>
    <li> I could accurately feel the moisture all day. Until I washed my face that night. Great product. Pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin. Really like it. I use all of Oil of Olay Products and use their make-ups also.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite body wash,so going to buy the larger size in the double pack.will stick to amazon..absolutely love amazon prime.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It has been an insufferable summer, the thought of putting on body lotion after a shower is a yuck moment, and yet, other body washes do nothing for me in the way of lasting moisture save for this product. Leaves a feeling of light moisturizer on skin after light towel drying and no need for skin lotion. Having tried just about every one on the market, I come back to this. It is over-priced in the stores so I order a two pack from Amazon, free Prime shipping, and that brings the per unit cost down to about 7.00 dollars.</li>
    <li> Did not like the smell.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, Wonderful Product!!  I have been using this product now for 2 years... because my skin is just so very dry. My skin is now so much &amp;#34;less itchy&amp;#34; with Olay Total Effects Advanced....  So many product brands that I have tried, were overly scented and did nothing to help my dry skin.  This product makes my skin so soft and I use it now with every shower.  It has a nice, light scent (and I do love the smell).  IF YOU HAVE DRY SKIN - PLEASE TRY THIS PRODUCT.  I am 60 years old and I wish I had known about this stuff 20 years ago!</li>
    <li> Love this body wash.  It is thick and creamy and leaves skin very soft and smooth.  The fragrance is light and very pleasant.  I paired this with the Olay In-Shower Lotion and was completely satisfied with the results!</li>
    <li> another product used on a daily basis by my wife. states that she highly recommends this body wash for quality</li>
    <li> I love Olay Total Effects, but the price was as much as the larger 15 oz bottle, so not a good deal at all.</li>
    <li> I have a very dry and sensitive skin and this is by far the ONLY product that works on my skin type. I never break out on this, and instead it keep my skin moisturised the whole day and feeling clean and bright. Just after 2 days of using, I instantly saw the diffirence right away...i couldnt believe it. I also have medium to tan skin but it just made my skin brighter which i love the most. I am 34 and most of my friends say i look 10yrs younger LoL. I&#x27;m pretty happy with that, and surely this product helps that a lot. Love this product and hope they will continue selling this for a long period of time :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.- I saw the price here at Amazon and it&#x27;s pretty expensive. You can get it so much cheaper at (Walmart or Target) which they always have on their shelves for 30-40% less. ( the shipping fee is killing you guys here... just saying).</li>
