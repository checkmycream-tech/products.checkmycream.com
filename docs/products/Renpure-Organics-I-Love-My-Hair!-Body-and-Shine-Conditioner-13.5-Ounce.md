      <li>and it shipped for free!</li>
      <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>Though this is sulfate free, it lathers well!  </li>
      <li>I need a product that does both in terms of moisturization and uses safe ingredients.</li>
      <li>safe ingredients that feel well on the scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
      <li>I love Renpure Organics products.</li>
      <li>All the ingredients are safe even if I need to use daily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love that it is organic but feel it does not do what I need in a every day shampoo.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my most favorite hair product.</li>
      <li>We had to have more so, I made a $25 purchase from this company online</li>
      <li>It works just ok.</li>
      <li>But it does NOT help my hair any better.</li>
      <li>I have really enjoyed the SHAPE of this container.  </li>
      <li>Love the idea of this product</li>
      <li>ITS  OK  </li>
      <li>THE SHINE  WAS PRETTY  GOOD  </li>
      <li>If you are sensitive to gluten, this is a great shampoo.</li>
      <li>not found cons yet, so far it is doing a great job</li>
      <li>Hair is wavy/curly, fine.</li>
      <li>I wish they are easily available is grocery stores too</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive hands and can never touch this without gloves on for sure!</li>
      <li>products they produce and are safe for my hair and body-which I really appreciate!</li>
      <li>Works very well, absolute value for no harsh chemicals shampoo &amp; conditioner that is perfect for colors.</li>
      <li>The scent is alright but not anything special.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have waist length hair, so a good conditioner is essential to keeping my hair manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall a good conditioner.</li>
      <li>This is a good solid staple conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Good for daily use.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t particularly bothered by the scent because mostly it didn&#x27;t follow me &#x27;out of the shower&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Super stuff.</li>
      <li>I still find I am able to use it without the headache most other fragrances give me but for those who are more sensitive you may not be able to.</li>
      <li>Yeah, conditioner works fine and the smell it totally reasonable....</li>
      <li>I try to use the most natural things I can find on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love the scent and how soft my hair feels after using it.</li>
      <li>This really doesn&#x27;t qualify as all natural, but it&#x27;s a nice compromise.</li>
      <li>Better than most on the store shelves but without the toxins which we all need to cut down on these days!</li>
      <li>though we preferred the red bottle more than this...</li>
      <li>This is better for someone with short hair, I believe.</li>
      <li>This works just as well as Aveda&#x27;s damage remedy and it is Much cheaper!</li>
      <li>Just wish it was available in stores near me.</li>
      <li>It does not moisturize my hair and does not detangle enough for my hair type, but I like the fact that it uses safe ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Free of many harsh chemicals</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Renpure for a couple of years and really like both the shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
      <li>found this conditioner to be gentle.</li>
      <li>and so if you are nose-sensitive it might be too much for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY</li>
      <li>It ended up straightening my hair and not being very moisturizing in the end though.</li>
      <li>Also, it actually gives me some volume unlike most natural conditioners.</li>
      <li>Only conditioner that keeps my hair soft and smooth!  </li>
      <li>so it is safe for your color, but at the same time out performs all the natural hair care products I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>Maybe it would work okay as a co-wash for some other curlies?</li>
      <li>Left my hair feeling clean and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>After several days I have noticed my hair is definitely shinier and has more body, just as the product claims.  </li>
      <li>I use several different conditioners and this one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>To my hair, it&#x27;s ok , not special.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend</li>
      <li>I was hoping for something thicker and a little more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Although I wish the bottles were a little bigger (because I love these products so much), you only need to use a small amount of shampoo &amp; conditioner to have great results.</li>
      <li>Do not use much on my hair or it will be too soft.</li>
      <li>the humidity where I live is sky-high</li>
      <li>If the cap is not completely closed the whole bathroom smells of this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>We use it on my 10 month old baby as well when we give him a bath and his hair looks thicker.</li>
      <li>He was allergic to Johnsons Natural care baby lotion</li>
      <li>house full of blondes that needs a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
      <li>I am sensitive to fragrances and while this is not as bad as most it does still have a somewhat strong fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Hydrolyzed proteins to build strength, some slip yet still silicone free, softness, and yes a little extra shine.  </li>
      <li>but after having round cylinders or tubes for so long -- I really appreciated having a container that feels right in my hands.  </li>
      <li>Enough that I decided to put all my old hair favorites in storage while I looked around for newer, gentler</li>
      <li>(I havn&#x27;t found the body and shine formula, just others by renpure)  the first and only other time</li>
      <li>RENPURE CONDITIONER was certainly gentle enough, but I didn&#x27;t feel as if I was getting enough conditioning for my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used to use the expensive salon sulfate free shampoo and conditioners but they were three times the price of this product that does exactly the same thing.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used Renpure for a couple of years and really like both the shampoos and conditioners.  They have several varieties for different hair types.  Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I love the scent and how soft my hair feels after using it. I will definitely purchase again. Just wish it was available in stores near me.</li>
    <li> This is very nice shampoo. All the ingredients are safe even if I need to use daily.&lt;br /&gt;I like there conditioners too. I wish they are easily available is grocery stores too</li>
    <li> It is organics . I can sense it by the smell. But it does NOT help my hair any better. Been using it for a month. Would stick with Nexus from Costco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up if this helps</li>
    <li> I used to use the expensive salon sulfate free shampoo and conditioners but they were three times the price of this product that does exactly the same thing. Super stuff.</li>
    <li> Loved it.  I have been looking for this in stores and I can&#x27;t find it.  It&#x27;s my most favorite hair product.</li>
    <li> It does not moisturize my hair and does not detangle enough for my hair type, but I like the fact that it uses safe ingredients.  I need a product that does both in terms of moisturization and uses safe ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is a good solid staple conditioner.  Hydrolyzed proteins to build strength, some slip yet still silicone free, softness, and yes a little extra shine.  Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> If you are sensitive to gluten, this is a great shampoo. Free of many harsh chemicals so it is safe for your color, but at the same time out performs all the natural hair care products I&#x27;ve found. This really doesn&#x27;t qualify as all natural, but it&#x27;s a nice compromise.</li>
    <li> ITS  OK  I WOULD  BUY AGAIN  BUT NOT GREAT.  THE SHINE  WAS PRETTY  GOOD  THE BODY  MAYBE  NEEDS IMPROVEMENT. IT WAS  A FAIR VALUE FOR THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> I use several different conditioners and this one is my favorite. Natural ingredients. Great slip. Great moisture. Good for daily use.</li>
    <li> Only conditioner that keeps my hair soft and smooth!  When you get this on subscription it is cheaper than the store!</li>
    <li> I have used Renpure Organic products for years. I usually get the red bottles &amp;#34;My pretty hair is parched&amp;#34; but went with this one to switch things up. I love the smell. It is so delicious I want to ingest it (but of course I won&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;Good products they produce and are safe for my hair and body-which I really appreciate!</li>
    <li> Because i feel it leaves my hair healthier  and It doesnt  leave a residue  on my hair. Creates  the strand to appear thick</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling clean and moisturized.  Didn&#x27;t feel like any residue was left behind.  Didn&#x27;t wash out my hair color either.</li>
    <li> For some reason my allergies have been on the warpath and even my scalp has been itching. Enough that I decided to put all my old hair favorites in storage while I looked around for newer, gentler products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This RENPURE CONDITIONER was certainly gentle enough, but I didn&#x27;t feel as if I was getting enough conditioning for my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW:&lt;br /&gt;--I found this conditioner to be gentle. By which it didn&#x27;t aggravate my allergies.&lt;br /&gt;--That said, it has a scent and so if you are nose-sensitive it might be too much for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;I like the RENPURE CONDITIONER. I wasn&#x27;t particularly bothered by the scent because mostly it didn&#x27;t follow me &#x27;out of the shower&#x27;. And if you want to wear perfume there won&#x27;t be a conflict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s summer and the humidity where I live is sky-high so I can&#x27;t just shine, but I did feel as if I wasn&#x27;t getting enough conditioning for my long, unprocessed hair. The conditioner was great for my daughter&#x27;s shorter hair. Didn&#x27;t weight it down and left it soft.</li>
    <li> It smells delicious and the smell lasts. Also, it actually gives me some volume unlike most natural conditioners. Only complaint is the bottle shape. I would prefer a shape that I could stand upside down.</li>
    <li> Love the idea of this product and I would have sworn it would have worked for me. It ended up straightening my hair and not being very moisturizing in the end though. Maybe it would work okay as a co-wash for some other curlies? Just wish I could think of a good way to use the rest of the bottle now...</li>
    <li> Good one though we preferred the red bottle more than this...the smell is not that great but works fine on the hair.</li>
    <li> It works just ok. I was hoping for something thicker and a little more moisturizing. It does the job but I will try another one from this product line next time. The scent is alright but not anything special. I have long hair and need a deeper conditioning. This is better for someone with short hair, I believe.</li>
    <li> Really nice conditioner...the only thing weird is the shape of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Hair is wavy/curly, fine. I get body and shine with this. Do not use much on my hair or it will be too soft.</li>
    <li> Works very well, absolute value for no harsh chemicals shampoo &amp; conditioner that is perfect for colors. Very pleasant odor.</li>
    <li> I love Renpure Organics products. I avoid using unnecessary chemicals on my hair, so I appreciate that their formula is mostly pure and leaves out all the junk. It smells amazing and leaves my hair looking healthy and nourished. Although I wish the bottles were a little bigger (because I love these products so much), you only need to use a small amount of shampoo &amp; conditioner to have great results.</li>
    <li> After several days I have noticed my hair is definitely shinier and has more body, just as the product claims.  I am sensitive to fragrances and while this is not as bad as most it does still have a somewhat strong fragrance.  If the cap is not completely closed the whole bathroom smells of this conditioner.  I still find I am able to use it without the headache most other fragrances give me but for those who are more sensitive you may not be able to.</li>
    <li> It smells really strong...like artificial fragrance. I have very sensitive hands and can never touch this without gloves on for sure! To my hair, it&#x27;s ok , not special. I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Great Conditioner!  I have a sulfate allergy and this is the only conditioner I will use.  The Shampoo is great too.</li>
    <li> This works just as well as Aveda&#x27;s damage remedy and it is Much cheaper! I run this conditioner through the ends of my dry hair and then get in the shower and wash it with the Body and Shine Shampoo. I have been bleaching my hair for years and Aveda Damage remedy has been the best thing to keep my hair looking its best and from breaking. My husband who has thin hair uses their shampoo as well and I guess the protein in it thickens his hair. He loves it as well! We use it on my 10 month old baby as well when we give him a bath and his hair looks thicker. He was allergic to Johnsons Natural care baby lotion but he has no adverse reaction to this shampoo. I try to use the most natural things I can find on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps. I can sometimes find this brand in the local grocery store but, (I havn&#x27;t found the body and shine formula, just others by renpure)  the first and only other time we tried it we got it from Wal-mart and then weren&#x27;t able to find it there again! We had to have more so, I made a $25 purchase from this company online and it shipped for free! It was a great deal considering I pay $22 for Aveda damage remedy shampoo. Aveda is only 8.5 oz. and it doesn&#x27;t lather like this. Though this is sulfate free, it lathers well!  I also pay $20-22 for Aveda conditioner and it is in a small container as well. This is a steal at about $7.</li>
    <li> This product cleans my hair but leaves it very dry. I love that it is organic but feel it does not do what I need in a every day shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product is great smelling and conditions beautifully. house full of blondes that needs a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
    <li> Better than most on the store shelves but without the toxins which we all need to cut down on these days!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used salon products that don&#x27;t measure up to this quality. Great stuff! I have long curly hair and it works wonders!</li>
    <li> Overall a good conditioner. It did weigh my hair down a bit so not sure id I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed the SHAPE of this container.  Yeah, conditioner works fine and the smell it totally reasonable.... but after having round cylinders or tubes for so long -- I really appreciated having a container that feels right in my hands.  (My hands are between small and medium when I get gloves.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have waist length hair, so a good conditioner is essential to keeping my hair manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order again!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-This conditioner has a great smell&lt;br /&gt;-Is Affordable&lt;br /&gt;-Straitens hair or brings out waves/curls&lt;br /&gt;-Has safe ingredients that feel well on the scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have not found cons yet, so far it is doing a great job</li>
