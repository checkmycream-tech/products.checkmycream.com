      <li>The kind you&#x27;d expect, gold-plated, in Trump&#x27;s penthouse suite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Battery warning through the app for your phone is nice.</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m going to spend this much money on a toothbrush, I expect EVERYTHING about it to work flawlessly.</li>
      <li>The app is also nice that it does track your brushings, flossings, mouth washings, and tongue scrubbings and will buzz you on your phone if it hasn&#x27;t recorded you brushing in a day or two if you&#x27;re having problems forming a habit.</li>
      <li>Does a great job and makes me brush longer because it is fun!  </li>

      <li>I definitely recommend this product and Amazon for they both have provided me with excellent service.</li>
      <li>With the downloaded able App you can also track your regimen progress on your device.</li>
      <li>glad I made this investment.</li>
      <li>Great toothbrush so far.</li>
      <li>Now for the best part, this item retails for $169.00, the price I paid was way below this, thanks to the great customer service representative who found an additional promotion because the color I requested was not available.</li>
      <li>, it also has a very good handle grip design even when wet.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good to look back and see that you are taking good care of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B heads seem to clean my teeth better than the Sonicare heads, I feel a more complete clean.</li>
      <li>but there is a huge a difference in cleaning between a  manual and Oral B 7000</li>
      <li>This is a great toothbrush and having the app on my phone only makes it fun!  </li>
      <li>I originally bought this after reading reviews about the bundled app and bluetooth capabilities.</li>
      <li>Initial charge time is fairly lengthy but overall very happy and highly recommended.</li>
      <li>teeth and gums feel clean</li>
      <li>I want clean teeth</li>
      <li>The separate display is great for children, as it displays the time spent brushing per quadrant as well as a child friendly smiley face.</li>
      <li>I am fully satisfied with my purchase of the Oral-B 7000 Smart Series electronic toothbrush.</li>
      <li>When I received the toothbrush, I found a lot of scratches on the top, although not affect the use, but it makes me very upset.</li>
      <li>The toothbrush has been carefully designed to offer you and your family a unique brushing experience that is both safe and effective.</li>
      <li>I like using the app better than the timer that came with the older models.</li>
      <li>The product is very pretty.</li>
      <li>This was my very first electronic toothbrush</li>
      <li>This toothbrush does an amazing job of cleaning your teeth and the charge lasts ten days with 2</li>
      <li>Great brush everyday</li>
      <li>Thanks for such a good production.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I finally replaced my old Oral-B brush and this one is great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price it costs.</li>
      <li>importantly, though: this does a better job of cleaning my teeth than any other electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;ve had a number of them.</li>
      <li>First of all, yes, it&#x27;s tech-y.</li>
      <li>Love the white color.</li>
      <li>Anyone who has kids should really get this!</li>
      <li>Quite honestly I bought this toothbrush due to it is approved by the ADA Association unlike the Phillips Sonicare.  </li>
      <li>the timer is really a fun/helpful feature.</li>
      <li>Sometimes a man of many words and other times I am not.</li>
      <li>Interesting function of bluetooth with smartphone, very useful,but little noisy when it working</li>
      <li>If I would have known this I would have most likely bought a different one and saved the money.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>This will last me a long time thats for sure.</li>
      <li>Most people probably don&#x27;t need that, but, for me, it holds me accountable and makes me less likely to bail 30 seconds into brushing because I&#x27;m in a hurry - which I very well might do at times otherwise -</li>
      <li>:-)t holds me accountable and makes me less likely to bail 30 seconds into brushing because I&#x27;m in a hurry - which I very well might do at times otherwise -</li>
      <li>Second, the brush has side lights that turn red when you press too hard - I find it to actually be a great helper, but I&#x27;d forgotten about that because I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;trained\\&quot; not to brush too hard now. :-)</li>
      <li>Thus I was left to purchase a new electric toothbrush</li>
      <li>The situation has been static for at least several months.</li>
      <li>Sure, if you don&#x27;t travel, this doesn&#x27;t matter at all, but if you *do* travel and hate having a manual toothbrush with you when you do, you won&#x27;t find a better travel case.</li>

      <li>So far, I can only pair it using Braun&#x27;s app on my phone.</li>
      <li>It is my first electric brush, so it took a little getting used to.</li>

      <li>I tend to brush for too little time, so this really helps me, and the tracking gets to my competitive side, ensuring I don&#x27;t brush too little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>

    <li> [[VIDEOID:b7140ffb3d03a667dd01d38cdb12a70d]] I know, I know... this is a really expensive toothbrush. Like, super expensive. The kind you&#x27;d expect, gold-plated, in Trump&#x27;s penthouse suite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I think it&#x27;s worth it. First of all, yes, it&#x27;s tech-y. If you hate tech like this, you might want to get another toothbrush. BUT! It actually does help. The app keeps you brushing longer. You pay attention to the time you&#x27;re brushing instead of thinking it&#x27;s time and then running off after 30 seconds. And... you can keep track of this over time, instead of just one brushing at a time. Me? I tend to brush for too little time, so this really helps me, and the tracking gets to my competitive side, ensuring I don&#x27;t brush too little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you watch the video, you see you get an *amazing* travel case. Sure, if you don&#x27;t travel, this doesn&#x27;t matter at all, but if you *do* travel and hate having a manual toothbrush with you when you do, you won&#x27;t find a better travel case. Seriously, it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, though: this does a better job of cleaning my teeth than any other electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;ve had a number of them. If I didn&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;d not have gone and bought another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to also note that mine came with zero scratches or blemishes (both this and my original one), so I&#x27;m sorry the other reviewer got a bad one, but I&#x27;ve had a couple in a row that have been perfectly good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I realized I didn&#x27;t include some info that might be helpful. The toothbrush comes with the display you can see in the video, which connects to it and provides info (which mode you&#x27;re in, how long you&#x27;ve been brushing, which quadrant to brush if you want to follow the graphic, and so on). You do *not* need to connect to a smartphone to use the Bluetooth capabilities - the separate display does that without a smartphone. However, with the smartphone app, you can track your brushing habits over time. Most people probably don&#x27;t need that, but, for me, it holds me accountable and makes me less likely to bail 30 seconds into brushing because I&#x27;m in a hurry - which I very well might do at times otherwise - because I don&#x27;t want to ruin my perfect record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the brush has side lights that turn red when you press too hard - I find it to actually be a great helper, but I&#x27;d forgotten about that because I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;trained\\&quot; not to brush too hard now. :-)t holds me accountable and makes me less likely to bail 30 seconds into brushing because I&#x27;m in a hurry - which I very well might do at times otherwise - because I don&#x27;t want to ruin my perfect record.

    <li> this toothbrush cleans well and I like the different cleaning modes. However, the android bluetooth app doesn&#x27;t work (check the reviews out for yourself in the google play store). It apparently was created several android versions ago and has not been updated. The situation has been static for at least several months. If I&#x27;m going to spend this much money on a toothbrush, I expect EVERYTHING about it to work flawlessly. it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This Oral-B is the best!I got it to replace an Oral-B I purchase in 2006,wow this is fantastic,a great and very powerful tool,LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush and having the app on my phone only makes it fun!  Does a great job and makes me brush longer because it is fun!  Anyone who has kids should really get this!</li>
    <li> Very good toothbrush. It&#x27;s worth the price it costs.</li>
    <li> I received my toothbrush a couple of days ago.  Overall, it does the job well in cleaning my teeth.  Unfortunately, what I did not know was that the Bluetooth function of this product and my phone&#x27;s operating system (Lollipop Android 5.0) are not compatible. I am simply not able to make the Oral B 7000 and my phone (Samsung Galaxy 5) communicate to take advantage of the apps benefits.  If I would have known this I would have most likely bought a different one and saved the money.  I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just receive it. The product is very pretty.</li>
    <li> Does a great job!  teeth and gums feel clean&lt;br /&gt;the battery lasts quite a while</li>
    <li> This is a great idea, but needs some follow-up work to implement the features that are advertised. The app and ecosystem need a lot of work. The app crashes every other time it is opened. The BT does not sync previous sessions (though it states it can sync 20), you can not go back and edit previous sessions for flossing, tongue brushing, or using mouthwash. There&#x27;s no way to access your logs from a web browser.</li>
    <li> This makes brushing your teeth a routine job. So simple to use.</li>
    <li> Quite honestly I bought this toothbrush due to it is approved by the ADA Association unlike the Phillips Sonicare.  I want clean teeth so I&#x27;ll try the oral b 7000 route this time.</li>
    <li> I love it. I will buy one more after use it.</li>
    <li> This was my very first electronic toothbrush so I dont have anything to compare this to but there is a huge a difference in cleaning between a  manual and Oral B 7000 and I cam glad I made this investment. The product is just amazing.</li>
    <li> Sometimes a man of many words and other times I am not. It&#x27;s a heckuva toothbrush and leaves me feeling like I left the dentist after every brushing. Initial charge time is fairly lengthy but overall very happy and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use this every day, twice a day and it has changed my life. My mouth feels great</li>
    <li> Great brush everyday,  great app very accurate,  love the travel case</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush!  I like using the app better than the timer that came with the older models.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush. It does a great job.</li>
    <li> Perfect, I love it.Thanks for such a good production.</li>
    <li> the best toothbrush i ever used. i upgraded my 5000 series with this one</li>
    <li> I finally replaced my old Oral-B brush and this one is great. Love the white color. This will last me a long time thats for sure.</li>
    <li> Its a toothbrush.  It works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this thing for a couple weeks and I have zero desire to ever use a conventional toothbrush again. It makes my teeth feel crazy clean and the timer is really a fun/helpful feature.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d rather use a traditional toothbrush</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush so far. It is my first electric brush, so it took a little getting used to. I&#x27;m also a technology guy, so of course I had to have the Bluetooth one!&lt;br /&gt;However, I do have trouble sometimes getting it to pair with my phone properly. So far, I can only pair it using Braun&#x27;s app on my phone. I&#x27;ve tried to manually pair the brush and my phone, but I can&#x27;t seem to locate the password for the brush to finish the pairing process. On the plus side, the brush does remember a fair handful of brushing sessions in between pairings so the app can catch up and keep its log of your brushing activities. The app is also nice that it does track your brushings, flossings, mouth washings, and tongue scrubbings and will buzz you on your phone if it hasn&#x27;t recorded you brushing in a day or two if you&#x27;re having problems forming a habit.</li>
    <li> Exceptional product. Very satisfied with the purchase</li>
    <li> When I received the toothbrush, I found a lot of scratches on the top, although not affect the use, but it makes me very upset.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a cheaper model that worked great. Just wanted to upgrade. I like the feature where you can create custom brushing times in a session. Battery warning through the app for your phone is nice. Brush keeps up with sessions so you can sync later to app. Excellent investment.</li>
    <li> Interesting function of bluetooth with smartphone, very useful,but little noisy when it working</li>
    <li> I am fully satisfied with my purchase of the Oral-B 7000 Smart Series electronic toothbrush. I previously owned the Oral-B Triumph 9000  Series, yes this  is no error,  lasted for over 8 years. I take good care of my electronic devices, the 9000 still holds the full charge on the battery, but will not rotate. Thus I was left to purchase a new electric toothbrush, their was no doubt in my mind that it would probably be an Oral-B, and so it was. The Oral-B 7000 has 6 speeds, bluetooth connectivity to the timer/clock display and your smartphone. The separate display is great for children, as it displays the time spent brushing per quadrant as well as a child friendly smiley face. With the downloaded able App you can also track your regimen progress on your device. While some of these features may be overkill to some, they do serve a valuable service. Now for the best part, this item retails for $169.00, the price I paid was way below this, thanks to the great customer service representative who found an additional promotion because the color I requested was not available. I definitely recommend this product and Amazon for they both have provided me with excellent service.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush has been carefully designed to offer you and your family a unique brushing experience that is both safe and effective.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does an amazing job of cleaning your teeth and the charge lasts ten days with 2 uses a day, it also has a very good handle grip design even when wet.</li>
    <li> I thought my Sonicare was doing a good job of keeping my teeth clean... and then I met this toothbrush. I originally bought this after reading reviews about the bundled app and bluetooth capabilities. After getting tired of Sonicare problems, this seems to be what I was looking for. I love using the app and the timer, the app also gives nice oral health tips while you brush. It&#x27;s good to look back and see that you are taking good care of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B heads seem to clean my teeth better than the Sonicare heads, I feel a more complete clean. I also use the tongue brushing mode every night and now never wake up with morning breath. Highly recommend this.</li>
