      <li>The Clairol hair color is a nice chocolate brown.</li>
      <li>This is the best &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; color because it has a natural complexity (not flatness) to it.</li>
      <li>This dye was easy to use, but more importantly, gave great coverage and color.</li>
      <li>Super shiny and gorgeous color.</li>

      <li>I love the product</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>as many have commented but it did nothing for me color</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good right after dyeing but starts to fade away after 3-4 washes.</li>
      <li>My hair looks beautiful and stays healthier with Natural Instincts</li>
      <li>Covers grey beautifully!</li>
      <li>When I first used this color, I loved the results.</li>
      <li>I am already having to resort to buying it online and finding a new hair color when your happy with the one you are using, is disheartening.</li>
      <li>this point, I would suggest using a strengthening product like the Herbal Essences Honey, I&#x27;m Strong Collection ([...]</li>
      <li>It provided so much slip! :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also has a more pleasant smell than other temporary dyes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true that it won&#x27;t damage your hair but</li>
      <li>Didnt cover very well for me, but then again I got a shade too light for my hair!</li>
      <li>I love the color, it looks very natural.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m lucky if I get a week out of this color.</li>
      <li>it comes straight to my door every month, so that&#x27;s easy and convenient.</li>
      <li>With this one it really looks velvety smooth and evenly distributed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has pretty good grey coverage.</li>
      <li>This color covered the blonde very well and left a nearly perfect even tone throughout my hair.</li>
      <li>to help get your hair back in better</li>
      <li>/&gt;This was my first time using box dye.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad this dye didn&#x27;t totally fry my hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Perfect for my dark dark brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but the color makes my eyes pop, very flattering.</li>
      <li>They really knocked the ball out of the park with this one.</li>
      <li>I found this here - this will save money on something I already use, and the fact that it arrived so fast is a bonus.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s safe for my relaxed hair and it leaves it soft and shiny and it lasts longer since I only shampoo about once a week.  </li>
      <li>and this is the only drugstore/grocery store brand available where I live.</li>
      <li>that the main product promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They usually last a good month, as long as I only wash every two days or so.</li>
      <li>I have naturally light brown/dirty blonde hair and blue eyes.  </li>
      <li>The black came out so rich and vibrant</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple different shades of dark dark brown in other brands, but I like this brand&#x27;s color the best.</li>
      <li>: stay far away from this \\&quot;refresher.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>When I washed it out my hair felt really soft.</li>
      <li>I have medium brown hair that I got professionally dyed to ombre.</li>
      <li>like with any dye the key is having a really high quality conditioner to apply when you wash it out.</li>
      <li>If you use a *small* amount it will just add some rich tint to your hair.</li>
      <li>for brunettes getting rich red tones under the dark brown is something that is hard to achieve so I am actually excited to have this stuff to play with since I am considering getting my tips dyed reddish.</li>
      <li>Not sure how much the 2 week re-color does, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how long it&#x27;ll last, but I&#x27;ve had good experiences with clairol natural essences hair dye, especially the medium brown and dark brown.  </li>
      <li>I love that the color is very dark but not jet black.</li>
      <li>the other thing that&#x27;s great is that it went on evenly and doesn&#x27;t have that artificial glow that a lot of box dyes with darker tones tend to produce.</li>
      <li>I am using it to cover grey and match my natural hair color.</li>
      <li>it really doesn&#x27;t cover well, and it washes out in less than 2 weeks.  </li>
      <li>If you have naturally dark brown or brown hair and you are looking for something classic</li>
      <li>I used Matrix Biolage color protecting conditioner and really could not tell it was just colored, even though the dye did sting a little on my head while I was waiting (10 mins)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this color.  I have naturally light brown/dirty blonde hair and blue eyes.  Skin tone is light/mediun. I thought it may be too dark a shade but the color makes my eyes pop, very flattering. doesn&#x27;t make me look washed out. I&#x27;m not sure how long it&#x27;ll last, but I&#x27;ve had good experiences with clairol natural essences hair dye, especially the medium brown and dark brown.  They usually last a good month, as long as I only wash every two days or so.</li>
    <li> This dye was easy to use, but more importantly, gave great coverage and color. I saw the color start to change as I was applying it. I love that the color is very dark but not jet black. I will definitely be buying it again and continuing to dye my hair this color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time using box dye. I have medium brown hair that I got professionally dyed to ombre. This color covered the blonde very well and left a nearly perfect even tone throughout my hair. Ten outta ten!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a video review I made for youtube:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good right after dyeing but starts to fade away after 3-4 washes. Leaves nice ans shiny hair after application. Serves my purpose, so will keep using it...</li>
    <li> I use this in Ebony Mocha and it&#x27;s a gorgeous brown/black color.  As dark brown as you can get without actually being black. Super shiny and gorgeous color. I color once a month, and my hair looks and feels healthier and softer AFTER I color than it was before. This leaves my hair incredibly silky. It has pretty good grey coverage. I purchase via subscribe and save, so it comes straight to my door every month, so that&#x27;s easy and convenient. Love it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> The Clairol hair color is a nice chocolate brown. I have always experienced great coverage with this product and buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> I like that minimal damage was done to my hair with this dye. I was not expecting it to be so black but I don&#x27;t mind it. I am afraid to use the color refresher as I&#x27;ve read MANY reviews on how awful it is. I may just skip it. I&#x27;m just glad this dye didn&#x27;t totally fry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I was afraid the color refresher would give me red hair as many have commented but it did nothing for me color wise.&lt;br /&gt;It did however cause a lot of breakage immediately after rising and continuing on afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Clairol and they said \\&quot;The ColorFresh Revitalizer is basically a tinted conditioner so it definitely shouldn&#x27;t be causing any breakage,\\&quot; and then said \\&quot;At this point, I would suggest using a strengthening product like the Herbal Essences Honey, I&#x27;m Strong Collection ([...] to help get your hair back in better shape.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think better advice would be: stay far away from this \\&quot;refresher.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> After my hair was decimated by a different product, I got this in a ditch all attempt to save face. The previous dye was henna and &#x27;all natural&#x27; and was disgusting and a horrible product, but this one was great. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel bad in texture, it doesn&#x27;t smell, and my only complaint is that my hair is closer to black than dark brown.</li>
    <li> When I first used this color, I loved the results. However, hard city water with chlorine really does a number on this. I&#x27;m lucky if I get a week out of this color. NOTE: DO NOT USE THE 2 WEEK REFRESHER!!! IT TURNS YOUR HAIR A &amp;#34;LUCY&amp;#34; SHADE OF ORANGE!</li>
    <li> They really knocked the ball out of the park with this one. If you have naturally dark brown or brown hair and you are looking for something classic this is a wonderful choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I have olive skin brown eyes and chestnut brown curly hair. This color was made for me. It looks like I was born with it on my head. It&#x27;s true that it won&#x27;t damage your hair but like with any dye the key is having a really high quality conditioner to apply when you wash it out. I used Matrix Biolage color protecting conditioner and really could not tell it was just colored, even though the dye did sting a little on my head while I was waiting (10 mins) the other thing that&#x27;s great is that it went on evenly and doesn&#x27;t have that artificial glow that a lot of box dyes with darker tones tend to produce. I always had lighter roots and very dark tips when I previously dyed my hair soft black or blackish brown. With this one it really looks velvety smooth and evenly distributed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly for the color refresh packet, I honestly don&#x27;t understand what people are so upset about. If you use a *small* amount it will just add some rich tint to your hair. I squeezed some out rubbed it in and left it alone while I showered. When I washed it out my hair felt really soft. No need to slather that stuff all over, in which case it will stain things and probably over saturate your hair. for brunettes getting rich red tones under the dark brown is something that is hard to achieve so I am actually excited to have this stuff to play with since I am considering getting my tips dyed reddish. I will be using this stuff in the future</li>
    <li> This is the best &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; color because it has a natural complexity (not flatness) to it. Wish it lasted longer though.</li>
    <li> This color came out like the pictures.  Per other reviews, I opted to skip the color refresh pack so I cannot speak of that.  Color faded after about 3-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> Didnt cover very well for me, but then again I got a shade too light for my hair! Thank you</li>
    <li> Why is this company selling this product? I&#x27;ve got skin irritation with gray hair. If you are Asian, this product may not work on you.</li>
    <li> if you have a lot of grey hair it really doesn&#x27;t cover well, and it washes out in less than 2 weeks.  I have now switched to a permanent hair color that doesn&#x27;t wash out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple different shades of dark dark brown in other brands, but I like this brand&#x27;s color the best. It&#x27;s very dark, but not quite that jet black you get with &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; hair dye. Perfect for my dark dark brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a more pleasant smell than other temporary dyes I&#x27;ve tried. Not sure how much the 2 week re-color does, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt. I like the conditioner, too. Plenty for the month, and it smells great leaving hair shiny.</li>
    <li> I just started using temp hair color in June 2014 and this is the only drugstore/grocery store brand available where I live. I love the product but I have a terrible time finding the No35 Brown Black. Please don&#x27;t discontinue it. I am already having to resort to buying it online and finding a new hair color when your happy with the one you are using, is disheartening. My hair looks beautiful and stays healthier with Natural Instincts and I don&#x27;t want to go back to the permanents.  It smells good too!  I am using it to cover grey and match my natural hair color.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in black and I absolutely love it. The black came out so rich and vibrant and I love the conditioner that comes with it. It provided so much slip! :)</li>
    <li> I am amazed that they are still selling this product with that crazy reddish &amp;#34;refresher&amp;#34;.  I used it once in the shower, and my neck, ears, hands, forehead got colored in the most awful rusty red color -- not even the Cool or Ash Brown color that the main product promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember that years ago this product was of much better quality, and did not have that useless refresher. I keep throwing it out when I use this product, but it annoys me that I have to pay for something I have to throw out, plus the metallic package will never decompose, so is harmful to the environment.</li>
    <li> I love the color, it looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt; And it&#x27;s great that the product doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical odor.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s safe for my relaxed hair and it leaves it soft and shiny and it lasts longer since I only shampoo about once a week.  Covers grey beautifully!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy I found this here - this will save money on something I already use, and the fact that it arrived so fast is a bonus.</li>
