    <li> Best blade I have used yet.  Sharp and precise!  I prefer Pro-Mate blades over any other brand.</li>
    <li> Blade was not all that sharp. Very disappointed in this blade. I&#x27;ve used promate before but this one is garbage. I probably won&#x27;t be ordering from them again.</li>
    <li> Cuts smooth,  doesn&#x27;t heat up and the blade being pre set reall cuts close.</li>
    <li> Smooth and Crispy Cut!</li>
    <li> Best there is,  pro-mate blades are like none other! Best blade available!</li>
    <li> I was questionable about the blade at first!!! I looked really close and notice that the blade was smooth to the touch when I ran my finger across it!!  I could tell that it was a quality blade when I looked at the screws and the polish on the blades!!! I like the contrast between the cutting blades, it made it very easy to zero-gap!!! Overall I recommend this blade to barber who do precision detailed work!!!  BLADEZ CERTIFIED</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Andis Outliner for a few years now, usually get the OEM replacement head. But after reading all the reviews for Pro-Mate, I decided to give them a try, and what a difference. Perfect fit on my clippers. Had to make a slight power output adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades are super sharp, comes already zero gap, and the most precise cut I&#x27;ve used with the exception of a straight razor. These are a must for anyone who cuts hair (professional or personal)</li>
    <li> Threw it on my GTX out of the box and it barely cuts. I zeroed out the blade and it still barely cuts. I could edge better with regular clippers... Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Above average. Stays cool.</li>
    <li> Black blades is even better. I been use promate blade which was gold color now this new black blades is even better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for over a month now and that investment was well spent.  Quick shipping and service,  the blades came already pre set,  they seem to take awhile before the get hot,  provide a very clean shave with little effort, and feels very soothing on the skin</li>
    <li> Smooth, sharp, stay cool!!!</li>
    <li> Yes. .. this blade hit so good. ..I like make my designs an line look crispy. ...I had 2 adjust my clippers 2 hit harder. ... bt I love em</li>
    <li> fantastic I stand in line to cut so well</li>
    <li> The best blade on the market. Well worth $20. Thus blade us super thin yet durable. Already zero gapped. Just place on clipper and go to work. As a celebrity barber I stand by great products. This is one that superceded expectations.  Ask me if you got questions. @reggieantonio7</li>
    <li> Fresh lines, cuts hella close to where you don&#x27;t even have to press down hardly.</li>
    <li> Horrible they barely cut only good thing about them is they look cool dont waste your money</li>
    <li> This blade is excellent right out of the package . Super sharp lines and superior shaving comfort. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> These blades suck in comparison to the Andis deep tooth blade. Figured I&#x27;d give it a try and quickly realized they were subpar.  I&#x27;ll stick with my Andis deep tooth blade.  Glad I didn&#x27;t get the trimmer because i was tempted.</li>
    <li> Much sharper than the stock Andis blades and runs very cool for long periods. Great blade. BTW- I use it for sharing and it works great. May require some adjustment, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> Greatly appreciate the product and that u were on point with the item. Love it</li>
    <li> Have a hard time adjusting the blade!</li>
