    <li> Works very well!!!  Will definitely go to this when I have issues with ingrown toenails in the future--can very likely save me painful trips to the podiatrist&#x27;s office (and money)!  I wish they would sell refills of the special bandage and retainer ring because the gel lasts almost twice as long as the other supplies.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really unbelievable.  I used it late in the evening and within an hour the entire ingrown nail was so soft I was able to just pull it out painlessly with a tweezer.  The swelling and pain vanished with the ingrown.  I didn&#x27;t need to use the cushions because there was nothing left to protect.  It does smell bad (sulfur, of course) but it&#x27;s hard to care about 5 minutes of bad smell for such effective and immediate relief.</li>
    <li> helped out with toe, for the price?? naw...</li>
    <li> It works. Use as direced, repeat if necessary, but it does indeed work. Or at least I can safely say it worked for me, no more painful toes.</li>
    <li> These should be terrific, but when these arrived, all of the band aids that were part of the kit were stuck to the paper and would not peel off for use. They had been in storage too long I guess, but they were not usable when they got here. I would recommend buying this product, but get it from a local drug store where the supply is likely to be fresh. These were useless...</li>
    <li> Did exactly what it was supposed to do. It relieved the pain and cushioned the nail bed. Very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> It does seem to soften the skin around the nail over night.  It dosen&#x27;t seem to be permant though.  I think you have to keep using it till the nail grows our or fix the problem with trimming.</li>
    <li> The only thing that worked for me without going to a foot Dr. Has an odor but used it every night until sore toenail grrw enough to deal with. Gaff used it twice on problem toenails.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this as I have a few ingrown toenails and was tired of the pain and trying to cut the toenails that were ingrown. This stuff, in about 3-4 days softened the ingrown nail enough to use the satin edge 2 sided ingrown toenail lifter and the toenail file by satin edge so that I could cut and file the nails to relieve the pain!!! One of the ingrown nails has not been ingrown since I did it about a year ago(still working on the other 2 though as they just want to be stubborn!!)</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a timely manner and is as expected. Thank you very much for this opportunity. What more can I say about ingrown toe nail stuff?? It works...</li>
    <li> Every so often I get an ingrown toenail that causes me excruciating pain. I purchased this product but had pretty low expectations that it would help out. To my surprise, the Dr. Scholls Toenail Pain Reliever Gel not only eliminated the pain within minutes, but it also enabled me to properly cut the nail within a matter of days. I would highly recommend this product, as it works exactly as advertised and is extremely easy to use.</li>
    <li> work well .. good price.</li>
    <li> the only problem with this product is its COST...too expensive!  but it does the job well and I just wish it would come in bigger size and less expensive</li>
    <li> Dr Scholls Ingrown Toenail Pain Reliever is the only remedy that works for me....it relieves the pain within 5 minutes.  The price and shipping speed were terrific. Will always buy this product.</li>
    <li> Very smart idea to get to the root of the problem!  The kit is perfect to apply with easy instructions.</li>
    <li> didnt use it..not what i thought it was..to complicated to use..</li>
    <li> Saved me from what I hear is a painful trip to the doctor!</li>
    <li> I had a very painful ingrown toenail to where even the slightest touch caused extreme burning and throbbing pain. I applied some of this stuff to the affected toenail and it relieved the pain within minutes. In less than an hour, the swelling went down and I was able to walk with very little pain. Within a couple of days, I was able to clip the affected toenail and now my toenail issues are gone.</li>
