      <li>A very good deal.</li>
      <li>They do a very good job of maintaining the whiteness of  our teeth.  </li>
      <li>These strips worked great for me.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great product as described by the seller.</li>

      <li>:) BUT!</li>
      <li>Easy to use and great results.</li>
      <li>The difference in my teeth is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Amazing how your teeth will look in just 3 wks.</li>
      <li>They tend to slip off very easily and you can not talk with them in.  </li>
      <li>Love these whiteners.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many teeth whitening products and Crest Whitestrips Supreme are definitely the best!</li>
      <li>advice is to buy them from a licensed reputable dentist.</li>
      <li>but the results are more noticeable.</li>
      <li>I cannot get the strips to stick to my teeth, top or bottom.</li>
      <li>Finding 1/2 hr from eating and brushing is interesting.</li>
      <li>excellent product convenient to use, if you drink coffee regularly a must for whiter teeth.</li>
      <li>, yes, they work, if you can get them to stay on your teeth, but there are better products out there.</li>
      <li>love this product, does what is said it will do</li>
      <li>The strips work well, much better that the OTH strips</li>
      <li>Great deal, much cheaper than from the dentist.  </li>
      <li>We are pleased and will order more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 51 now and the teeth look pretty good.</li>
      <li>It was to strong for my teeth though.  </li>
      <li>For those coming from the Advanced Seal strips, you&#x27;re going to cry your eyeballs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was getting worried that they got lost, but was happy to hear that she got a notice from the local post office that the package has arrived.</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>These strips at about $60 a pop beat getting a tune-up on my original bleaching job</li>
      <li>Really quick delivery.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>They are exactly as described!</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>My teeth gradually got nice and white.</li>
      <li>the hubby and I each tried one and noticed difference right away.  </li>
      <li>works very well, use it periodically and my teeth stay nice and white</li>
      <li>so we know it wasn&#x27;t just our imaginations  ;)</li>
      <li>I suggest Crest Advanced Seal Professional Effects.</li>
      <li>So, next time I will give the link to this site and seller to my dentist, I promised :)</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I will tell you the first day</li>
      <li>I wish I  would have read reviews first.</li>
      <li>I will certainly be using them again.</li>
      <li>I have been using these strips for several years, and they work fine for me and my wife,  </li>
      <li>so my teeth weren&#x27;t very colored to begin with, but I thought I&#x27;d give them a try.</li>
      <li>or so my teeth are especially sensitive to this product.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery ..</li>
      <li>and I just felt like I was fighting them the whole time.  </li>
      <li>The formula is much stronger so they whiten well, but they are a pain to use.  </li>
      <li>they were much easier to wear .</li>
      <li>Did the trick, visible results surprisingly fast.</li>
      <li>Finally, the results were not as good as the results I had from using the other Crest whitening strip products.</li>
      <li>Better than other over the counter whitening products.</li>
      <li>I have used other Whitestrip products that stayed on so much better.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different Whitestrips and these are my least favorite.  </li>
      <li>Yes, they slide a little on the teeth, but for the most part they stay on for the required 30 minutes.  </li>
      <li>both experienced some minor sensitivity after 1 use, so will only use them every other day...</li>
      <li>This is an older product from Crest, and they have since developed their product to be much easier to use.</li>
      <li>As described, new and expire 2016</li>
      <li>I used the Crest 3D Whitening strips with great success but am totally disappointed with the Whitestrips Supreme.</li>
      <li>They had originally used the strips in the fancy box you buy in the drug stores, and these work equally as well and cost a whole lot less.</li>
      <li>Also would recommend using one strip a day if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>My biggest issue with the Supreme professional strength strips is that they do not stick to your teeth</li>
      <li>The lower strips slide the most mainly because my tongue lays behind the lower teeth and pushes the strips off.</li>
      <li>They were exactly what was expected.  </li>
      <li>In the future, I would buy directly from a dentist and not waste my money.</li>
      <li>I purchased the same exact white strips from my dentist last year...</li>
      <li>Received my box with only 37 strips in it today and the box clearly was opened.</li>
      <li>My dentist noticed a difference between the tone of the front and rear teeth by himself and asked me where had I bought these strips (you know, they are rather expensive in Russian stores and online stores, because nobody knows about such a fast and safe method of whitening in our country)</li>
      <li>Too bad, the results were good</li>

<li> I thought I would give these whitening strips a try after using several other of the Crest Whitening Strip products (1 hr express, 2 hr.</li>
<li> I have used professional bleaching trays and other crest white (advance seal) strips in the past,  </li>
<li> EXPENSIVE AND NOT GETTING FULL VALUE.</li>
<li> No problems with sensitivity or slipping.</li>
<li> Just as expected.  </li>
<li> I ordered two boxes, one for myself and the other for grandson that just had braces removed.</li>

<li> Plus it&#x27;s not much more than the store ones</li>
<li> It&#x27;s clumsy to get the thin strips positioned just right, but not so bad once they are on.</li>
<li> Would recommend like the dentist not to brush your teeth for at least 4 hours before use.  </li>
<li> I would say our teeth are a couple of shades lighter at least.</li>
<li> These are so thin and flimsy, very hard to keep in place.  </li>
<li> You poor dear...</li>
<li> but they were just too frustrating.</li>
<li> Unfortunately I will not be purchasing these again because of the hassle of trying to keep them on.</li>
<li> These strips came to my cold faraway Russia in one or two weeks</li>
<li> Needless to say these whitening strips disappointed.  </li>

    <li> EXCELLENT product! My teeth look amazing now! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different Whitestrips and these are my least favorite.  They tend to slip off very easily and you can not talk with them in.  The formula is much stronger so they whiten well, but they are a pain to use.  Unfortunately I will not be purchasing these again because of the hassle of trying to keep them on. You need to use them an hour a day and I just felt like I was fighting them the whole time.  I have used other Whitestrip products that stayed on so much better.  Too bad, the results were good but they were just too frustrating.</li>
    <li> Ce produit est génial !!! Au top !!!</li>
    <li> The product was delivered as advertised.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but they do help a little. It&#x27;s clumsy to get the thin strips positioned just right, but not so bad once they are on.</li>
    <li> These strips came to my cold faraway Russia in one or two weeks and I started using it immediately. After after the tenth strip I went to the dentist not about my whitestrips but concerning the hole in the tooth :) BUT! My dentist noticed a difference between the tone of the front and rear teeth by himself and asked me where had I bought these strips (you know, they are rather expensive in Russian stores and online stores, because nobody knows about such a fast and safe method of whitening in our country) So, next time I will give the link to this site and seller to my dentist, I promised :)</li>
    <li> excellent product convenient to use, if you drink coffee regularly a must for whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> As others wrote, these do NOT adhere to teeth--slide off...even swallowed one!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered two boxes, one for myself and the other for grandson that just had braces removed. I wish I  would have read reviews first. These are so thin and flimsy, very hard to keep in place.  I have used professional bleaching trays and other crest white (advance seal) strips in the past,  they were much easier to wear .</li>
    <li> WILL NOT STICK TO YOUR TEETH.  EXPENSIVE AND NOT GETTING FULL VALUE.</li>
    <li> Received my box with only 37 strips in it today and the box clearly was opened.</li>
    <li> I have been using these strips for several years, and they work fine for me and my wife,  In fact, we split the one box between us. They do a very good job of maintaining the whiteness of  our teeth.  Yes, they slide a little on the teeth, but for the most part they stay on for the required 30 minutes.  The lower strips slide the most mainly because my tongue lays behind the lower teeth and pushes the strips off. Therefore,  I make a concerted effort to keep my tongue still for the precribed length of time. These strips at about $60 a pop beat getting a tune-up on my original bleaching job I got back in 2006 from my dentist. I use these strips once a year for maintenance.</li>
    <li> Worth the money. Amazing how your teeth will look in just 3 wks. I used it 30 mins before work and 30 mins before bed.</li>
    <li> Although the expiration date was not expired ... the bleach was defective because it did nothing.  In the future, I would buy directly from a dentist and not waste my money.</li>
    <li> Works quite well. Better than other over the counter whitening products.</li>
    <li> works very well, use it periodically and my teeth stay nice and white</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many teeth whitening products and Crest Whitestrips Supreme are definitely the best! I get compliments on my white teeth all the time. Great product as described by the seller. I was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> I cannot get the strips to stick to my teeth, top or bottom. The strips seem too thin, not rigid enough.  I used the Crest 3D Whitening strips with great success but am totally disappointed with the Whitestrips Supreme. Can I exchange?</li>
    <li> My wife and I shared the package, so we each used half. I would say our teeth are a couple of shades lighter at least. We are pleased and will order more.</li>
    <li> Great deal, much cheaper than from the dentist.  They were exactly what was expected.  The strips work well, much better that the OTH strips you purchase locally.</li>
    <li> Did the trick, visible results surprisingly fast. Definitely would buy again if needed to.</li>
    <li> Really quick delivery. Great product. Value for money. I will be ordering from this seller again. The difference in my teeth is amazing.  Would recommend like the dentist not to brush your teeth for at least 4 hours before use.  Also would recommend using one strip a day if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I will order again from seller ...</li>
    <li> love this product, does what is said it will do</li>
    <li> These strips are worthless, don&#x27;t adhere to the teeth, and can&#x27;t be returned.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> This is an older product from Crest, and they have since developed their product to be much easier to use. Why did I purchase them anyway? I DON&#x27;T KNOW. Reviews, maybe?? Reviews from 2006!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should know: these don&#x27;t stay on your teeth without a fight. For some coming from regular strips, you won&#x27;t mind - slippery strips is the only world you know. You poor dear... For those coming from the Advanced Seal strips, you&#x27;re going to cry your eyeballs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR, yes, they work, if you can get them to stay on your teeth, but there are better products out there. I suggest Crest Advanced Seal Professional Effects.</li>
    <li> Love these whiteners.  Easy to use and great results.</li>
    <li> It worked to some degree. But I hoping for whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> After some research, I ordered a box of these.... the hubby and I each tried one and noticed difference right away.  We took &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; pics, so we know it wasn&#x27;t just our imaginations  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both experienced some minor sensitivity after 1 use, so will only use them every other day... not twice a day like the instructions say you can.  Can&#x27;t imagine doing that unless you had a photo opp coming up soon.... not many of those on my calendar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a bargain, especially compared to buying way smaller boxes of a lower strength Crest product at the local drugstore.</li>
    <li> I get comments from people asking if I whiten my teeth after finishing a box. I will tell you the first day or so my teeth are especially sensitive to this product. The same thing happened the last time. I almost stopped. But I went the next day and forward with no problems. Finding 1/2 hr from eating and brushing is interesting. I use the ride home from work and my morning shower. In the shower you have to watch breathing thru your mouth so you don&#x27;t take in water and have the strips move around. I don&#x27;t drink coffee or tea all day so my teeth weren&#x27;t very colored to begin with, but I thought I&#x27;d give them a try. This is my second box. I will certainly be using them again. I&#x27;m 51 now and the teeth look pretty good. Plus it&#x27;s not much more than the store ones but the results are more noticeable.</li>
    <li> Ordered November 2014, just noticed the Best Used Date on the bottom is SE/2014 which I assume this means September 2014.  Will try to return but I am not getting my hopes up.</li>
    <li> I thought I would give these whitening strips a try after using several other of the Crest Whitening Strip products (1 hr express, 2 hr. express, etc).  Needless to say these whitening strips disappointed.  My biggest issue with the Supreme professional strength strips is that they do not stick to your teeth (basically it&#x27;s a cellophane strip with some peroxide gel on one side).  All of the other Crest strips have some sort of adhesive property which allows them to stick firmly to your teeth.  Also, since I have never seen these for sale at a pharmacy or available in a dentist&#x27;s office, it makes me skeptical about where these come from?  Finally, the results were not as good as the results I had from using the other Crest whitening strip products.</li>
    <li> Terrible. I purchased the same exact white strips from my dentist last year...and they worked beautifully-however when I purchased them from Amazon they didn&#x27;t work at all!&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t know if they had counterfeit ingredients but they were terrible.&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to buy them from a licensed reputable dentist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand off and on for years whenever I need to refresh the whiteness of my teeth.  Love them!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my grandsons.They had originally used the strips in the fancy box you buy in the drug stores, and these work equally as well and cost a whole lot less.</li>
    <li> Just as expected.  It works as well as all the other Crest Whitestrips Supreme Professional Strength strips I have used.  Something I can count on.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> WORKED WELL AT WHITENING BUT DO NOT STICK TO TEETH...</li>
    <li> Bought these Crest whitestrips for my girlfriend who lives in Europe at the end of January and she finally got them March 5th a couple of days after the deadline. I was getting worried that they got lost, but was happy to hear that she got a notice from the local post office that the package has arrived. Asked her recently what are her thoughts on the strips, and she likes them.</li>
    <li> The best whitening strips out there</li>
    <li> These strips worked great for me. My teeth gradually got nice and white. No problems with sensitivity or slipping. Now I use one treatment a week or so to maintain. A very good deal.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery .. As described, new and expire 2016</li>
    <li> They are exactly as described! Not expired!</li>
    <li> The strips definitely worked! Without a doubt!!  It was to strong for my teeth though.  The sensitivity of my teeth went through the roof after 2 times.  I had to stop using them.</li>
