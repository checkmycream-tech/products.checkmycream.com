      <li>Great workout for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It looks like a great, affordable product and seems to have a consensus among reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>great</li>
      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>This product is AMAZING!</li>
      <li>and I have to say it wasn&#x27;t a pleasant feeling.</li>
      <li>The seller processed my order very quickly and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>good purchase  </li>
      <li>And ahhhhh does it feel good.  </li>

      <li>Its a good product and cheap&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good product, prompt delivery</li>
      <li>Good for lymph drainage</li>
      <li>Impressed by product - worth owning</li>
      <li>After using the face-up roller I noticed my skin feels tighter and more energized!</li>
      <li>It works much better than massaging my face with my fingers!  </li>
      <li>The rollers feel really good, Just make sure you cleanse and moisturize your face before using it.</li>
      <li>use Nozema to wash my face with  warm water,&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
      <li>Even if it just helps me to ease some tension in my face, I will consider it well worth the purchase, as the tmj can cause my jaws and ears to hurt, and it would be a great boon</li>
      <li>Anyway assembling the roller for the neck is easy!</li>
      <li>Overall, it was a great experience and I am happy with my product.</li>
      <li>and the results are pretty great.</li>
      <li>I bought this roller from Ebay and it is very cheaply made.</li>
      <li>, I know that in six more weeks that I will see collagen</li>
      <li>I like it so far because it does give a good massage and good circulation to my face.</li>
      <li>Maybe if I used it more.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I am buying more to have a stock pile of them.  </li>
      <li>For my purposes it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>, I wish it could provide a bit more pressure.</li>
      <li>I will have to post an update sometime, I want to give it a month, but if nothing else, I sure do find it soothing.  </li>
      <li>The muscles feel more relaxed.</li>
      <li>make sure I Roll all the way from my cheeks to my Temples of head,&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a toy than an usuable roller...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very fun to play with and just to roll all around your face when you have time lmao</li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughter who was very excited about it</li>
      <li>Well this thing, in one upward stroke, puts a good amount of pressure on your cheeks, and you can continue to massage it effectively and easily for a good ten minutes if you were up for it.  </li>
      <li>But it would make a good gift for your girlfriends because it is an unusual massager that works so well!</li>
      <li>I received it quite quickly which was great, and for the price it was just as great as I expected it to be.</li>
      <li>This thing doesn&#x27;t come very nicely packaged, so don&#x27;t send it directly from Amazon as a gift to someone.  </li>
      <li>(only roll upward; downward causes longterm sagging&#x3D; a &#x27;no-no&#x27;)Good luck!</li>
      <li>And I found this, reasonable price + free shipping&#x3D; Happiness :</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and seems to be doing the job.</li>
      <li>This tool looks and feels a bit cheap</li>
      <li>It was worth the buy :))</li>
      <li>Continued use has provided fantastic results.</li>
      <li>Now that is fantastic.</li>
      <li>This may seen to fit and everything</li>
      <li>it came, it was cheap plastic</li>
      <li>I put my night cream on before using it and it seems to have helped the cream be absorbed more quickly.</li>
      <li>Took so long time for mine to arrive that I forgot I had ordered this thing lol.</li>
      <li>So worth it!</li>
      <li>I received this item quickly, and so far love it!</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference after a good month of daily use.</li>
      <li>A really good invention actually, because when I get sore in my jaw, trying to massage with my hands is both tiring and ineffective.  </li>
      <li>overall, the product is good.</li>
      <li>I use this to massage the neck, inner forearms and cheeks, I think this can give good results</li>
      <li>It is fun to do while watching TV and the results are amazing so far.  </li>
      <li>The item is an easy and quick two step assembly and ready to use.</li>
      <li>I did try what another reviewer said and tried it with moisturizer on my face after my first try, but I think I like the way it feels better without the moisturizer, but would certainly use some after wards.  </li>
      <li>Her Stuff Is VERY COSTLEY !!</li>
      <li>I used a metal nail file to smooth these out, and now it feels really soft.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t worth your money.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so worth it</li>
      <li>It would be worth it for that alone if it helps, and I will want to post an update after I have used it for a while.  </li>
      <li>Worth the price to try and see.</li>
      <li>fun item  </li>
      <li>But you can somewhat  control the pressure, so maybe for the price it would be worth a try.</li>
      <li>was really excited to receive it and the package came fast.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It helps to do this after you&#x27;ve washed your face, and right before moisturizing.</li>
      <li>...just do it the right way.</li>
      <li>Went right into the trash</li>
      <li>Nice little facial massager that feels good.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m forty-five years old with fair Irish skin.  </li>
      <li>Just pay close attention to the illustrations on the packaging, start the stroke where the picture indicates (not lower or higher) and do fast quick motion on clean, freshly moisturized face, use extra moisturizer to make it roll fast and smooth.and smooth.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>that  broke the first time she used it</li>
      <li>:) use it ever night in combination with facial exercises (which sped my results (eventually).</li>
      <li>It works just as well as the more expensive ones and even if it breaks in the future, it&#x27;s ok since the price was really nice!</li>
      <li>I plan to use it at bedtime, as I carry a lot of tension in my jaws, also first thing in the morning.  </li>
      <li>First off, I have done</li>
      <li>I really want to return it!</li>
      <li>It was my first time trying any type of massager for my face</li>
      <li>When the packaged arrived, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect or if to believe that what I&#x27;d read was really possible, but it was.</li>
      <li>The product arrived EXTREMELY fast!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s pretty alright.</li>
      <li>It broke on the first try (</li>
      <li>This thing is weird and awesome.  </li>
      <li>tried everyday, good massager but did not work to shape the jaw</li>
      <li>They work better on moisturized skin, plus it will not only help with the blood circulation in your face and neck,  but it will help really infuse your moisturizer into your skin.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m having instant results, but I did enjoy using it for the first time today, and will keep trying for a while.  </li>
      <li>This face roller arrived pretty quickly for the price (half a month + free shipping from Singapore).</li>
      <li>his is something that overtime will really help.</li>

    <li> I use it every night at the end of my motioning routine. Not sure if it slims my face but it does feel good. The muscles feel more relaxed. It&#x27;d a bit painful at first but I imagine it&#x27;s why it works.</li>
    <li> tried everyday, good massager but did not work to shape the jaw</li>
    <li> the quality is bad. doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> :D it actually works....and works well.I noticed a difference after a good month of daily use. I&#x27;m not saying it takes a total month or more to see results, u can see a subtle change after 1 or 2 weeks...or at least I did. I love it. I noticed softer n tighter skin :) use it ever night in combination with facial exercises (which sped my results (eventually). After a couple weeks of rolling habitually I rolled harder for 10-15MAX. Going over 15mins can cause breakouts(honestly going over 10mins is pushing it!) Tips: I found rolling harder works well when ur face gets used to the routine.(rolling harder for 10min or less) depending on how hard u roll. (only roll upward; downward causes longterm sagging&#x3D; a &#x27;no-no&#x27;)Good luck!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this new 2-in-1 Face up Roller, because my original face up roller was borrowed by a relative and haven&#x27;t been returned. This product is great. I can massage my face and chin and get rid of extra fat at the same time. Now that is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Good product, prompt delivery</li>
    <li> It is fun to do while watching TV and the results are amazing so far.  I am buying more to have a stock pile of them.  Better than dangerous surgeries.</li>
    <li> OWW! It hurts to massage my face with this because its so tight and not flexible or bendable, it just pushes my cheeks together painfully and the bottom massager stick pushes against my throat and also hurts... I don&#x27;t know if this works but it might give my face bruises if i did this for 10 minutes every day! also The plastic on it is sorta rough and scratches my face...All in all, I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> I just got this today, and tried it out for a few minutes.  I find it very soothing to massage with.  After using it for a few minutes, I felt as though the roller stimulated my skin, and felt like my mouth was lifting at the corners.  I looked in the mirror, and there was definitely blood flow to the face, such as I might see after using a facial mask.  I plan to use it at bedtime, as I carry a lot of tension in my jaws, also first thing in the morning.  I have mild tmj  (which is short for a medical term that means my jaws don&#x27;t quite work right), and my dentist says that I grind my teeth.  I am hoping that using it at bedtime will help to relieve the tension in my jaws, and help to relieve the tmj.  It would be worth it for that alone if it helps, and I will want to post an update after I have used it for a while.  I&#x27;m 54, and also hope that it will ultimately help to tone my skin, and smooth it out some.  I won&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m having instant results, but I did enjoy using it for the first time today, and will keep trying for a while.  Even if it just helps me to ease some tension in my face, I will consider it well worth the purchase, as the tmj can cause my jaws and ears to hurt, and it would be a great boon if loosening them up with a massage might help me to quit grinding my teeth at night.  I will have to post an update sometime, I want to give it a month, but if nothing else, I sure do find it soothing.  I did try what another reviewer said and tried it with moisturizer on my face after my first try, but I think I like the way it feels better without the moisturizer, but would certainly use some after wards.  The only problem I have with it is that the instructions are in Chinese, but there are illustrations on the back of the package that show what parts of the face this product is intended for, and how to use it.  See you in a month!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty cheaply made but it cost me so little that I can&#x27;t complain! But it really did help, I tend to hold a lot of fluid in my face and this really helped disperse that</li>
    <li> I guess, this product needs to be used everyday to achieve the result you are looking for. I like it so far because it does give a good massage and good circulation to my face.</li>
    <li> This thing is weird and awesome.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using it enough to show so much of a difference in my cheek size, but I do feel that it does help drain some built up subcutaneous fluids and help to relax any knots from clenching.  And ahhhhh does it feel good.  A really good invention actually, because when I get sore in my jaw, trying to massage with my hands is both tiring and ineffective.  Well this thing, in one upward stroke, puts a good amount of pressure on your cheeks, and you can continue to massage it effectively and easily for a good ten minutes if you were up for it.  There is also an attachment for your chin, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on that well.  But I don&#x27;t really care because I prefer the cheek parts anyway.  I can see that it could be painful to some, but so is deep tissue massage so if you prefer swedish massage then maybe I would pass.  But you can somewhat  control the pressure, so maybe for the price it would be worth a try. This thing doesn&#x27;t come very nicely packaged, so don&#x27;t send it directly from Amazon as a gift to someone.  But it would make a good gift for your girlfriends because it is an unusual massager that works so well!</li>
    <li> I was watching Suzanne Somers On tv, &amp; she&#x27;s Great,&lt;br /&gt;But Her Stuff Is VERY COSTLEY !!&lt;br /&gt;The way i do this  is,&lt;br /&gt;Before Bed,&lt;br /&gt;I use Nozema to wash my face with  warm water,&lt;br /&gt;Then dry It good,&lt;br /&gt;Then i use a Anti aging  creme  on my face,&lt;br /&gt;then i take these ROLLERS &amp; ROLL HARD ( NOT TO HARD TO BREAK )&lt;br /&gt;&amp; I almost Fall Asleep  Standing up  Doing this !!!  REALLY,&lt;br /&gt;I make sure I Roll all the way from my cheeks to my Temples of head,&lt;br /&gt;Then i roll it Over my chin  ( about 5-6 min )&lt;br /&gt;Day  &amp; night.&lt;br /&gt;It Makes my skin Glow,&lt;br /&gt;It tightens My skin,&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE IT WITH OUT ANY CREMES !!!&lt;br /&gt;Ponds Cold Creme Is also Great for this as well,&lt;br /&gt;I change off with my cremes &amp; I NEVER use the same one !!&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps &amp; im a open book to ask me About it !!</li>
    <li> When I first ordered this product, I was a little weary. On other sites, tools like this are much more expensive and really cheap prices have got me bad products, or not receiving my order at all, in the past. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised! This tool wasn&#x27;t cheaply made, works so very well, and arrived long before the deadline! My jawline looks tighter and my skin is softer around that area. I am very happy with this product and the seller.</li>
    <li> I got it yesterday and only used it once with instant results!  I&#x27;m forty-five years old with fair Irish skin.  First off, I have done self finger collagen stimulation face massaging in the past, and it takes time and you do get immediate results in the sense that you can manipulate the fluids and shunt them away down the neck. But it&#x27;s tedious and time consuming whereas this only took a minet or so and it served the dual purpose of massaging in my moisturizer.  I know that technique works, which is why I was hopeful when I ordered this product.  It works much better than massaging my face with my fingers!  I saw INSTANT results, I know that in six more weeks that I will see collagen increase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay close attention to the zones and direction in the illustrations on the back.  I found that if I use it on dry unclean skin it can make the skin look a bit drier looking and crinkly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, make SURE you wash your face and follow with EXTRA moisture prior to use, then it glides crazy smooth and infuses the moisturizer at the same time!!!  Do it for your am cleanse/moisturizer and for your pm cleans/cream.  I found that doing hard (not too hard as to break the device) short, very rapid motions about, fifty or so, real fast in each zone produced instant results.  The subcutaneous fluids were shunted away and my skin felt &#x27;alive&#x27; with circulation.  About a half hour later I could feel my facial muscle twitching slightly and lifting upwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a delicate product, so I wish I would have got two or three and paid only once for shipping.  Oh, well, live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t take the rollers all the way up and over and PAST your cheek bones, as that can push the fluids back into the nasal fold and jowls.  Just pay close attention to the illustrations on the packaging, start the stroke where the picture indicates (not lower or higher) and do fast quick motion on clean, freshly moisturized face, use extra moisturizer to make it roll fast and smooth.and smooth.</li>
    <li> Really, how can this possible help? A little pressure rolling up, a little rolling down . . . I feel silly for buying it. At least this one arrived with instructions and only slightly battered. The other one, from different vendor, was unwrapped and broken. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Nice little facial massager that feels good.  I use it for 10 minutes at a time and my facial muscles get a nice little workout.</li>
    <li> First assembling the two pieces was harder than it looks. It was my first time trying any type of massager for my face and I have to say it wasn&#x27;t a pleasant feeling. Not only did it hurt but it irritated my skin. The pink numbs are made out of plastic and hurt as hell when I&#x27;m trying to massage my face. So I use it for 15 minutes then starting noticing that my jaws were turning red so I stopped, couples hours I noticed small bumps forming along my jaws that weren&#x27;t there before. That freak me out. Conclusion I&#x27;m never using this again.</li>
    <li> I had been recommend a face roller by my fave youtube beauty guru! And I found this, reasonable price + free shipping&#x3D; Happiness :D!&lt;br /&gt;I was supposed to originally get it 2 weeks from now but got it WAY earlier! Which is great, so when I opened the package. It was way bigger then I though but then again it is for the face. Anyway assembling the roller for the neck is easy! I tried it out and could instantly feel my face tighten!&lt;br /&gt;Buy the roller it&#x27;s so worth it</li>
    <li> This face roller is one of the worst things I have ever gotten. It&#x27;s cheaply made and feels horrible on the skin.</li>
    <li> This is very simple I use this to massage the neck, inner forearms and cheeks, I think this can give good results</li>
    <li> I got this to massage my face as my jaw muscles have been hurting a lot lately. For my purposes it&#x27;s ok, I wish it could provide a bit more pressure. No matter how much pressure I use it doesn&#x27;t transfer due to the design of the item. Also the little &amp;#34;petals&amp;#34;  aren&#x27;t completely smooth, it seems that the seam of whatever mold they&#x27;re made from is right at the edges of them and thus there are places that are almost sharp.</li>
    <li> ...just do it the right way. This may seen to fit and everything but it isn&#x27;t worth your money. Dont fool yourself.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING! When the packaged arrived, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect or if to believe that what I&#x27;d read was really possible, but it was. The item is an easy and quick two step assembly and ready to use. The three rollers work together to generate a rowing motion along your cheeks and neck, generating a tingling sensation. Continued use has provided fantastic results.</li>
    <li> I took the time to read the customer reviews and to compare this product to similar ones. It looks like a great, affordable product and seems to have a consensus among reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to receive it and the package came fast. However, I did not receive the face roller. Instead, I got fake nails. Hundreds of them. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed and to top it off, the seller will not respond.</li>
    <li> I bought this roller from Ebay and it is very cheaply made. It broke on the first try (one of the plastic pieces just came off) and the rollers had sharp edges that scratched my face. What a bummer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and I felt like i wasted my money on this. it doesn&#x27;t do anything at all..no changes on my face</li>
    <li> My face a little big, that can make me face-lift effect may be liquid back nose wrinkles and double chin. Good for lymph drainage so I tend to use it in one direction!</li>
    <li> Impressed by product - worth owning</li>
    <li> My face is looking thinner,I&#x27;ve been getting compliments!But my product was half open when it arrived!Roll for 10 min each night and you should see results.</li>
    <li> I paid the price for &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; cogit cellulose roller for face up, but Jubujub sent me the old/used one with visible scratches all over it. It wasn&#x27;t worth it for me to ship it back to the seller and pay the shipping fee. I ended up throwing it away. Who knows what it would do to my face.</li>
    <li> not sure if the back and forth motion is good for lymph node drainage so I tend to use it in one direction and wonder that question about the lymph nodes everytime I use it as it says on the packet....</li>
    <li> Does it work? Eh, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. Maybe if I used it more. I roll it starting at my chin, along my jawline, and then I turn it so it rolls down my neck. This way, I&#x27;m not rolling it back toward my chin, if that makes any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I wanted to add in a tip. Yes, it does have plastic edges that will hurt your face. I used a metal nail file to smooth these out, and now it feels really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy rolling, I guess?</li>
    <li> I really like it but Im not really sure if its actually working</li>
    <li> I only used it twice but it&#x27;s pretty alright. I like it aha It&#x27;s very fun to play with and just to roll all around your face when you have time lmao</li>
    <li> The product arrived EXTREMELY fast! I&#x27;m 28 and over this last year started to notice my face is beginning to sag a little around my jaw and neck area. After using the face-up roller I noticed my skin feels tighter and more energized! The rollers feel really good, Just make sure you cleanse and moisturize your face before using it. They work better on moisturized skin, plus it will not only help with the blood circulation in your face and neck,  but it will help really infuse your moisturizer into your skin. And at a great price!</li>
    <li> a little chintsy plastic but a fun gift.  good to help apply creams et cetera  good purchase  fun item  great</li>
    <li> I brought this item not so long ago and it has shipped to me. It is damaged and non-refundable! It&#x27;s more like a toy than an usuable roller... This is crap item! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! IT&#x27;S WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
    <li> I received it quite quickly which was great, and for the price it was just as great as I expected it to be. There were a few rough edges on the plastic but nothing a nail file couldn&#x27;t fix and the results are pretty great. My face is less puffy, and it really helps define my cheekbones when I detach the smaller one and role it around.&lt;br /&gt;it is almost as if it drains he fluid from my face lol. And I know that t his is something that overtime will really help.</li>
    <li> I received this item quickly, and so far love it! It&#x27;s easy to use, and seems to be doing the job. I already feel the results!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who was very excited about it&lt;br /&gt;when it came, it was cheap plastic that  broke the first time she used it</li>
    <li> I see it working!!!! Hurts a little at the beginning, but I feel it&#x27;s giving my face a workout.</li>
    <li> Took so long time for mine to arrive that I forgot I had ordered this thing lol. This tool looks and feels a bit cheap but it SERIOUSLY works! Usually when I use my hand to massage my jawline, I would feel bumps but after using this tool for a couple of days, the bumpiness on my face smoothed out! So worth it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Worth the price to try and see. It does not hurt like some others have said and I don&#x27;t have any edges that I have to file off.</li>
    <li> I thought it was something different</li>
    <li> It was worth the buy :)) I got this as a face massager cause i have tmj an it works for me LOL</li>
    <li> This face roller arrived pretty quickly for the price (half a month + free shipping from Singapore). It works just as well as the more expensive ones and even if it breaks in the future, it&#x27;s ok since the price was really nice! The seller processed my order very quickly and I am very happy with my purchase. Overall, it was a great experience and I am happy with my product.</li>
    <li> I expected this to be junk based on the price and photo, I was right. It arrive broken, pieces were missing inside the sealed bubble packaging. Went right into the trash</li>
    <li> There are some sharp edges to it, but not enough to cut through your skin. overall, the product is good. Havent seen any effects of it yet.</li>
    <li> There is a lot of sharp edges on those roller. I would not recommend to use it on the face.</li>
    <li> it doesnt work trust me！！！！ And the quality is not very good too!! I really want to return it! its a joke!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen dramatic effects, but I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days and it massages your face well. It does hurt at first, especially on unmoisturized skin, but you get used to it. Arrived in the expected time interval as well. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Its a good product and cheap&lt;br /&gt;And I think it might work&lt;br /&gt;It feels like it is working but im not sure yet</li>
    <li> I cannot give 5 stars yet as very early as i just started using this, will give my ratings after a month or so. Like it as even you&#x27;re watching TV, you can use this roller and hopefully my face gets  smaller (especially my chin) as I have gained few pounds recently.</li>
    <li> The roller brightens skin by increasing bloodflow and I now that I have tried it I am a believer. My skin does not look as puffy and seems to be firmer.&lt;br /&gt;The device comes with two sizes of rollers but I preferred the smaller ones. I think it is personal preference. It was simple to use and I only used it for 15 minutes while I was watching TV and will continue to do it everyday. I put my night cream on before using it and it seems to have helped the cream be absorbed more quickly. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Great workout for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps improve jaw/cheekbone lines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps to do this after you&#x27;ve washed your face, and right before moisturizing. (helps keep from clogging pores)</li>
