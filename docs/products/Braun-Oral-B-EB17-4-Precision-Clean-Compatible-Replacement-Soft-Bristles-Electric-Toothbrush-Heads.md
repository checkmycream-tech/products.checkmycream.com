      <li>Seem like a perfect substitute for the name brand.</li>
      <li>Works perfectly as my costco Braun heads.</li>
      <li>Great bargin</li>
      <li>Great price.</li>
      <li>These tooth brush heads fit our Braun Oral B electric tooth brush perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Good replacement heads for good price.  </li>
      <li>Good</li>
      <li>the brush head does not rotate effectively after seven uses.  </li>
      <li>They work very well and are a great price!</li>
      <li>Good cheap brush heads.</li>
      <li>Ordered my second set of these because they work perfectly and are so inexpensive.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t tried all 5, but the first one sets up a good expectation.</li>
      <li>The bristles are fine, it is the running gear that broke.</li>
      <li>Fit well into my Oral B electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I do not understand how a great company like Amazon can continue to sell such a product.  </li>
      <li>Great deal for unbelievably low price!</li>
      <li>I ended up ditching the oral b all toghter, and buying a cheap spin brush instead.</li>
      <li>These may be good if this is your only type of tooth brush</li>
      <li>Not one of these heads has lasted more than seven days of normal use.</li>
      <li>Some of them don&#x27;t fit very well on the brush, requiring quite a bit of pressure to install or remove them.</li>
      <li>These NEVER failed, even after 3-4 months.</li>
      <li>Why spend more for the same product.</li>
      <li>The first one lasted 30 uses.  </li>
      <li>but I will not try them again - no matter how much I can save.</li>
      <li>These seem to be identical in quality to the Braun brand at a much cheaper price.  </li>
      <li>I was worried about ordering a generic version of the bristles, but they fit and rotate well in my toothbrush.</li>
      <li>After the first two lasted for a total of 10 weeks, I used the third one mostly on the low power setting of my Braun Oral B toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Some the heads stopped working on their first use, some after second use.  </li>
      <li>I replaced them because the bristles got soft.</li>
      <li>On the third brush so far in a month.  </li>
      <li>thought, when I bought these that, even if they last half as long as the name brand heads, they&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
      <li>1 worked as expected the other 3 broke the first week.</li>
      <li>They stop spinning after a few weeks, and the gap between the head and body is large enough to suck in your lip while brushing.</li>

<li> My wife used two of the Oral-B heads in the time it took me to use the other Oral-B head and this entire four-pack of generics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Almost the same review as Crystal wrote on 9/1/13:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Two out of four gone in less than a month.....</li>
<li> Such a waste.</li>
<li> I can use it, but it&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
<li> ordered your Braun Oral-B EB17-4 Precision Clean Compatible Replacement Soft Bristles Electric Toothbrush Heads and noticed within a week that your toothbrushes stop starting to rotate oscillate very bad money badly spent and wasted you should talk to manufacturer and tell am to stop making selling defective money wasting toothbrushes</li>
<li> Bristles were not soft and did not fit the handle well.</li>
<li> First one lasted a week and internally failed so the head wouldn&#x27;t oscillate.  </li>
<li> Not worth it.</li>
<li> Two out of four gone in less than a month.....</li>
<li> One lasted less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
<li> After a few weeks the gear broke and stop rotating.</li>
<li> Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on these.</li>
<li> Same problem as others, broken head stops spinning.</li>
<li> This product has been repeatedly complained about and two emails from me to the seller have gone unanswered or acknowledged in any way.  </li>
<li> I expect the other two to fail in the same manner after a few weeks.  </li>
<li> What a waste of money !</li>
<li> The third one still failed after three weeks.</li>
<li> They are a lot less expensive than the name brand replacement heads cost.  </li>
<li> I was a little worried I would damage my expensive brush</li>
<li> A \\&quot;broken head\\&quot; is when the brush stops working, i.e. rotating.  </li>
<li> /&gt;These products are made so poorly that it is an insult to customers of Amazon to have them listed.  </li>
<li> All of them have broken and stopped spinning prematurely.</li>
<li> sorry I bought it.</li>
<li> All of them failed to rotate.</li>
<li> I tried to save money as these are so expensive when buying name brand.  </li>
<li> It failed immediately!</li>
<li> /&gt;Maybe this was a bad batch</li>
<li> The plastic they&#x27;re made of is thinner than the Oral-B heads, and you&#x27;ll get a nasty pinch if you rest the opening on the front of the brush against your lip.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
<li> Terrible product.  </li>
<li> Horrible.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Awesome . Perfect. Why spend more for the same product. Works perfectly as my costco Braun heads.</li>
    <li> Horrible.  Some the heads stopped working on their first use, some after second use.  None lasted longer than that. Meaning the head made noise but the bristles did not move so I was left with a standard toothbrush.  I tried to save money as these are so expensive when buying name brand.  I ended up ditching the oral b all toghter, and buying a cheap spin brush instead.</li>
    <li> Bristles were not soft and did not fit the handle well.</li>
    <li> Great deal for unbelievably low price!</li>
    <li> 1 worked as expected the other 3 broke the first week. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Stopped spinning after one day.  Changed head, worked once and stopped spinning. Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on these.</li>
    <li> Good replacement heads for good price.  They are a lot less expensive than the name brand replacement heads cost.  Good</li>
    <li> Fit well into my Oral B electric toothbrush. I was worried about ordering a generic version of the bristles, but they fit and rotate well in my toothbrush. Haven&#x27;t tried all 5, but the first one sets up a good expectation. Great price.</li>
    <li> Junk!  Same problem as others, broken head stops spinning. 3 out of 4 had this problem.  DO NOT buy!</li>
    <li> Good cheap brush heads.</li>
    <li> the brush head does not rotate effectively after seven uses.  I would not recommend this product and sorry I bought it.</li>
    <li> I can use it, but it&#x27;s not what I expected. The brushes do fix properly on the handle, and when you change to a new one it&#x27;s really hard to get the used one off.</li>
    <li> These tooth brush heads fit our Braun Oral B electric tooth brush perfectly.  Seem like a perfect substitute for the name brand.</li>
    <li> I bought a two-pack of Oral-B toothbrushes from Costco. They came with three Oral-B heads. My wife used two of the Oral-B heads in the time it took me to use the other Oral-B head and this entire four-pack of generics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• All of them have broken and stopped spinning prematurely. One lasted less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;• The plastic they&#x27;re made of is thinner than the Oral-B heads, and you&#x27;ll get a nasty pinch if you rest the opening on the front of the brush against your lip.&lt;br /&gt;• The sizing of the heads is inconsistent. Some of them don&#x27;t fit very well on the brush, requiring quite a bit of pressure to install or remove them. I was a little worried I would damage my expensive brush handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought, when I bought these that, even if they last half as long as the name brand heads, they&#x27;ll be worth it. They didn&#x27;t last that long, plus, they hurt me and could potentially damage the brush handle. Not worth it. I&#x27;ll buy Oral-B from now on.</li>
    <li> Some it works, others don&#x27;t. Not even the same ones.</li>
    <li> Two out of four gone in less than a month.....the circular part on the end breaks and quits spinning.  Do not recommend.  This second one lasted a week.</li>
    <li> These seem to be identical in quality to the Braun brand at a much cheaper price.  I would definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> I broke 2 heads within 3-4 uses.  A \\&quot;broken head\\&quot; is when the brush stops working, i.e. rotating.  All it does is just shake in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are made so poorly that it is an insult to customers of Amazon to have them listed.  I will be requesting a refund immediately.</li>

    <li> Not one of these heads has lasted more than seven days of normal use. Such a waste.</li>
    <li> Bought this item recently. Me and my wife  used all them  for the last 3 weeks  All of them failed to rotate. What a waste of money !</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  They stop spinning after a few weeks, and the gap between the head and body is large enough to suck in your lip while brushing.</li>
    <li> I do not understand how a great company like Amazon can continue to sell such a product.  This product has been repeatedly complained about and two emails from me to the seller have gone unanswered or acknowledged in any way.  Of the four brushes, I&#x27;m using the third.  The first one lasted 30 uses.  The second lasted 4 uses.  The third, I&#x27;ve got my fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> A fraction of the price of the name brand ones. I will definitely order them again once I&#x27;m done with this set of four.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my family.  The different colored bands help us know who each one belongs to.  They work very well and are a great price!</li>
    <li> On the third brush so far in a month.  First one lasted a week and internally failed so the head wouldn&#x27;t oscillate.  Second one lasted about 3 weeks before having the same issue.  I expect the other two to fail in the same manner after a few weeks.  Also, there must be a tiny gap on the attachment of the bristle head where it moves as it would pinch my mouth now and then.  Never had these issues with actual Oral-B brushes.  I will stick to the name brand from now on.  These may be good if this is your only type of tooth brush and you need to let a guest use.  Throw away item.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product the heads stop rotating after a week or so,you might as well buy a regular tooth brush</li>
    <li> Ordered my second set of these because they work perfectly and are so inexpensive. Great bargin</li>
    <li> How can Amazon sell (or partner in the sale of) these junk toothbrushes? After the first two lasted for a total of 10 weeks, I used the third one mostly on the low power setting of my Braun Oral B toothbrush. The third one still failed after three weeks. Today I pulled out the fourth and last brush. It failed immediately! Before this, I had used no-name brand brushes from Walmart for several years. These NEVER failed, even after 3-4 months. I replaced them because the bristles got soft.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. It works and fits well but does not last. The bristles are fine, it is the running gear that broke. After a few weeks the gear broke and stop rotating.</li>
    <li> Says it fits Vitality toothbrush but it doesn&#x27;t. It went back.</li>
