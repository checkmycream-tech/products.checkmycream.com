<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Working just fine so far. The blades are a different design than previous one ordered, but fit O.K.</li>
    <li> Its not the same as the original, but it still works nontheless.</li>
    <li> the item received does NOT fit my shaver. the description was deceptive when i ordered.&lt;br /&gt;further research indicates the cartridge I need is Series 70S ,9000 Series Pulsonic.&lt;br /&gt;I hope you can rectify this , I am a good customer of Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you. Richard R Jencen</li>
    <li> I replace the cutter block and foil set for my Braun shaver every year on my birthday. It&#x27;s like getting a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year I got a cheaper set that was probably counterfeit. It shaved worse than the old worn one. This product OTOH was high quality - the right stuff.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time in new condition. Easy replacement and excellent results.</li>
    <li> Not much to say other than it&#x27;s a replacement razor head and it works.  If you have a Braun 7000 series and you need a replacement razor head, you should buy this.</li>
    <li> What else can I say other than the product was as advertised. The shipping was fast and the package was in perfect shape. Once again I have a smooth face with out the burn from old blades.</li>
    <li> This has been the best electric razor I&#x27;ve used - the replacement parts worked like they said and I am very pleased with this product. Will buy again as needed.</li>
    <li> This bladed replacement adds new life to a wonderful product. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Braun.  Keeping it going like new is just a sound strategy!</li>
    <li> It works great!!!! turns your old razor into a brand new one for little money.</li>
    <li> Ive had my Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro since 2003 and its been a great shaver. These replacement packs make it work as good as the day I bought it. Don&#x27;t buy a new shaver just replace the important parts!</li>
    <li> A good choice to re-furbish one&#x27;s own razor. [ASIN:B000050FDX Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro / Syncro Replacement Combo]</li>
    <li> The replacement product does not seem to work as well as the original.  There are certain places that it misses that the original didn&#x27;t.  Other than that it works well.</li>
    <li> Ordered the older version and they sent the new one but works great!</li>
    <li> Even though the Braun shaver says replace every 6 months I usually put it off much longer. This was a fine replacement for my previous set which had started to pull when cutting. Glad to see these parts are still available as I bought the shaver nearly 6 years ago.</li>
    <li> This product fits perfect in my 8000 series Braun but works so much better than the listed cutting block and foil made for it.  Get this and save $$ along with a better shave!  If you have to have the same color razor parts then you are out of luck.  If you want that old Braun shave quality back enough said.</li>
    <li> A lot of folks who use electric shavers tend to take them for granted. They seem to feel that the cutting parts will last forever with no maintenance whatsoever. Then, when the shaves aren&#x27;t as close as they would like, they tend to blame the machine rather than their own inattention. Braun provides a little sticky label that you can put on your shaver to remind you to change the foil and cutter blocks, and to put the approximate date around which this should be done. It&#x27;s recommended, and extremely easy to do, even for a manually-challenged lawyer such as myself! Everything is provided, all you have to do is a few short moments of labor, and your shaver is as good, and as close, as new. What more can anyone ask?</li>
    <li> As with two other reviewers here, my foil developed large holes within 6-9 months of purchase.  I can&#x27;t imagine how Braun claims 12-18 month lifetimes for this part.</li>
    <li> Thought I was going to be up for quite a few bucks when the button refused to stay down to start the cleaning process.I must have had the shaver about 8 years and I like it.The replacement top shell was very finicky to re-attach.After some delicate alignment I was able to put it all together again.Definitely worth the effort.A shame there is no instruction guide somewhere on line to make the assembly easier.Maybe Braun should help out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun 7526 for 6 months before the hole appeared in the foil. Well, if you do not press hard, it doesn&#x27;t hurt your face. However, after a couple of weeks the hole became larger and, finally, the sharp pieces of foil suddendly started to stick up. I scratched my face badly. Before the hole the shaving was very nice, though. Braun&#x27;s warranty doesn&#x27;t cover the foil and cutter block, but they agreed to replace mine free of charge. Nice customer service.</li>
    <li> I have recently purchased my 3rd replacement combo. A major annoyance with my two previous foil blocks (including the one that shipped with my shaver) was that it would very easily pop off my shaver, sometimes even just from the vibration of shaving. I was pleasantly surprised that the foil block has apparently been redesigned, because the latest one I bought sits solidly on my shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While Braun suggests that you replace the foil and cutter block every 18 months, very likely you will want to do it much sooner. &lt;br /&gt;For me about replacing it about once a year seems right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars instead of 5, because it just doesn&#x27;t last as long as advertised. But perhaps I am luckier with my newest replacement in that aspect as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent cutting head and great razor.  I&#x27;ve been using Braun for about 8 years now.  Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a &#x27;regular&#x27; razor, but I get no razor burn with this electric razor.  I crunched the numbers and it costs the same or less to use the electric over regular razors.</li>
    <li> The best razor I have ever used, as long as you replace the cutting block and foil. They have also updated the design of the foil to the newer design in the newer razor.</li>
    <li> Braun has always been one of the best shavers.  I&#x27;ve had mine for several years now.  I almost bought a new one when I realized I could replace the head and blades fairly inexpensively.  I was a little skeptical at first, but that changed when I switched out with the new head and blades.  Thats all it needed.  It is as good as new and I saved about 100 bucks over relacing the whole thing.  It is a no brainer in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Same problem others are reporting.  The blade is OK but the cutter block is not wide enough.  It is not really even close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Braun&#x27;s 800 number on the package and described the problem, and they are sending me a new blade/block which should arrive \\&quot;from 14 to 21 days\\&quot; from now.  The service rep did not know about this issue and seemed to assume it was unique to me...  So I have a suspicion the replacement will not fit, either.  Maybe if enough people call Braun and complain, somebody will notice and fix the underlying problem.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know who to blame: Amazon or Braun. The foil piece does not fit my Braun 7505 electric shaver. Earlier models of the replacement package must have fit the 7505 based on the earlier happy customers, but not now.    Addendum:  I called Braun customer service (1-800-272-8611). They were very helpful and offered to send me a replacement combo. I was afraid I&#x27;d get the same exact combo, but today it arrived via FedEx and both parts snapped in perfectly. Hopefully Amazon will read these reviews and switch to the correct part number (which, by the way, is Braun P/N 5491356).</li>
    <li> Braun products are largely recognized as excellent ; I hope their shaver line (and replacement sets) will come back soon to be available in Brazil, where I live.</li>
    <li> I found the new replacement kit to be excelent.  Shaving was taking longer and longer and then the screen developed a hole and  I decided ti replaced it.    The new shave is 10 times better.  Price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> This replacement combo was exactly what I needed to make my Braun 7505 like brand new. Payment and shipping couldn&#x27;t have been easier and I received the parts in a timely manner. Amazon even sent emails to keep me informed and allow me to track the shipment as well. Great transaction, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> As others already said, every 5 to 6 months the metal foil brokes and you feel that the shaver is hurting your face. The last piece I installed has worked for 7 months and I&#x27;m waiting a failure shortly. I wish it could last for one year or more, in this way I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.    However, when in perfect condition, it works perfectly. My beard points to whatever direction, nevertheless, I can still cut it with no effort, smoothly and fast. I suggest to clean the blades using the brush once a week for better performance.</li>
    <li> I already owned this item.  I needed to replace some parts.   It is very good.</li>
    <li> The product pretty much is what it is. It&#x27;s a little expensive, but it has given my razor it&#x27;s &#x27;edge&#x27; back.</li>
    <li> The heads have been slightly re designed and are better than they were.  Product arrived early. Better price than in local stores although the price has gone up. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Purchased new blades and blade cover for my Braun razor. Now after going a couple of weeks with it pulling and biting me (prior to the purchase) I&#x27;m pampered by a close and painless shave each morning. I should have done this months ago.</li>
    <li> This product is an original replacement and I wouldn&#x27;t trust my face to anything else. It is also very durable. In a nutshell, I trust Braun products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this Braun shaver for the past 4 years.  The first set of heads that came with the shaver lasted 3 and this set has lasted just one and is now worn out again.  These things bite you when they wear out.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product and the delivery.  My old one had a rip and was scratching up my face. The replacement is so smooth ... I should have ordered one long ago.  It came very quickly after I ordered too ... thankfully.</li>
    <li> I put a recurring reminder on my Google Calendar every 18 months to replace the cutter block and I am always glad I change it as I can tell the difference with the new blade and screen.  Results: A smoother, closer shave.The one I just got even seems to be a little more sturdy than the previous one, with the blades being slightly thicker, and the block more cushioned.</li>
    <li> I have had my Braun 7000 series for over 5 years and love it. After trying all the other brands, I found the Braun to be the best. This is why I have purchased the replacement heads and blades year after year.</li>
    <li> Went from a bad diffucult shave to a quick sharp shave in a minute just by replacing the blade and screen.  Easy to install.</li>
    <li> It is always nice to get these every year, even though the manucacturer recommends only every 18 months. They are always sharp and clean and ready to go. I still like to run them through the cleaner before first use. It feels better that way. The best price is $30 for these, SO KEEP AN EYE OUT whenever they&#x27;re less.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000050FDX Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro / Syncro Replacement Combo]]    Bought this one in late 2007 and just ordered a replacement. Shaved at least once per day and always loved it.</li>
    <li> Getting this new blade is like having a new shaver -- at a fraction of the price. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> My shaver is 5 years old or older. Still these folks were able to get the replacement parts, Shaver is working great again.    Thank you</li>
    <li> This same item was $10 more at the local Walmart.  Its pays to research.   The product is great!</li>
    <li> After a months use the close shave has deteriorated to a poor shave. My beard now feels like I have shaved 12 hours ago right after shaving ... not good for a new cutter and foil. The original lasted two years. Cheap Chinese junk!</li>
    <li> Lucky for me I have a thin beard.    But wow; first time I&#x27;ve had to buy a replacement for my Braun shaver and boy it&#x27;s pricey. Recommended to replace every 6 months? yikes.    Anyways; best price I&#x27;ve seen so far is this amazon deal. I bought a new blade because my old one was starting to pull at my hairs. So far so good on this replacement. I didn&#x27;t really need a new netting though... wish they had just the blade for sale. I didn&#x27;t see it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 8595 after reading multiple reviews about the new replacement models and how they were not as good as the older style. I purposely bought this 7000-series replacement for my 8000-series razor because I wanted to get the older style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, seems like they have run out of the old style and are now sending the 30Bs without any warning. So buy at your own risk, this product is not being sold as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, it fits my 8595, and the initial shaves are ok. We&#x27;ll see how it is after 6 months, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 2 years later and I&#x27;m still getting good shaves out of this. Wow. I&#x27;m getting close to replacing, but will be doing so with another 30b when I do.</li>
    <li> It was right on time.  Packaging was awesome and the product was received quickly.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> There was no way I was going to buy another one of the now low quality 8000 series replacement foil/cutter blocks for my Activator. I purchased this one on the advice from another user who posted a comment on the 8000 series product. Works great! I took a very close look at the cutter and you can EASILY see why the older 7000 series is better. Much more solid to begin with, a full circular piece of metal, the 8000 series looks like its trying to save on metal, its only a hemispherical cylinder. On top of the the cutter edges themselves are much slimmer in this one.  The 8000 series are fat metal rings where as the 7000 has very slim metal rings. Anyway you won&#x27;t go wrong getting the 7000 series mentioned above!</li>
    <li> Shaves like a new razor.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> After reading some reviews that recommended this replacement instead of the newer one for my old Braun 8585, I gave it a shot. It works perfectly. I&#x27;ve had my shaver for about five years and I don&#x27;t remember the last time I replaced the cutting block, but this is giving me a noticably better/closer shave. Highly recommended as a replacement for use on the 8585 model.</li>
    <li> These are genuine Braun replacement parts. I have been buying them for years from Amazon. The vendor is reliable and usually ships in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this for the 8000 series and I&#x27;m soooooooo happy to have bought this replacements instead of the \\&quot;new\\&quot; design we&#x27;ve had in that series for about 3 years now!  This original cutter and foil design (thin cutter blades) gives HANDS DOWN the best shave ever, much preferred to to the lousy \\&quot;new\\&quot; design (thick cutter blades, or however you want to describe it).   [Braun, are you listening? Why would change a winning product? ]  I&#x27;ll be using these replacement in the future, had almost forgotten how nice it is to shave w/o pulling your hair... I was about to change brands, after about 20 years on Brauns...  Oh, and as some other reviewers have pointed out: don&#x27;t use the base / auto-cleaner!   Just remove foil and cutter, and manually brush away hair rests from both. If you also manually [generously] apply the cleaning liquid with a brush, then you get a much better shave and they last MUCH longer. The cleaning liquid will also last longer since you will cover it again with the original lid - no evaporation.   My base unit (i.e. the auto-cleaner / charger) has gone to recycling years ago...</li>
    <li> I left 1 star because that is the lowest rating.&lt;br /&gt;Braun &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; to make an excellent razor.  I was always impressed at the quality of the shave and that you hear every hair being snipped off.  when I couldn&#x27;t hear that sound, I knew it was time for a new cutter and foil.&lt;br /&gt;but some genius at Braun decided he could do this cheaper and now my Braun Synchro shaves like crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wife got me a new panasonic raor for xmas.........I LOVE IT....IT SHAVES LIKE MY BRAUN USED TO!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with price after shopping locally.  I never realized how bad the razor was until replaced blades and screen.</li>
    <li> I have a 5 year old Braun 8585 shaver.  It worked great until I had to order a replacement foil/cutter combo.  For some reason Braun introduced the garbage 8000 Combo Pack for the shaver that 1) doesn&#x27;t work well and 2) costs more.  I am writing to confirm what another review stated about using a 7000 Series cutter on an 8000 series shaver.  IT WORKS GREAT!  My shaver now cuts as well as it did when it was new.  There are only 2 differences: 1) it costs ~$10 less and 2) it&#x27;s black instead of silver...  so what?  Thanks to a fellow reviewer for a great tip that hopefully other Braun users can benefit from as well.</li>
    <li> Even though this replacement combo was for another braun model, it worked well with my older 8585 shaver.  The only problem was with the existing plastic cover.  It didn&#x27;t fit over this head.  but it was sharp and does provide a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I gave a bad review to BUY A ELECTRONICS and it was partially my BAD! Although the item shipped did not match the picture shown on the Amazon website, I still ordered the wrong cutter/foil for my Braun 7000 Series shaver. This shaver does NOT take the 2 part series 7 cutter/foil but a single unit replacement. It gets confusing because of all the mismatched models and replacement part numbers.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun SyncroPro 7505 shaver which is now about 4 years old. This is the 3rd Braun that I have owned and have always had wonderful service from this brand. I bought my first Braun, many years ago, when I was on a diplomatic mission to Omsk, Siberia. I did not know what kind of power outlets I was going to find, so after some experiments, I leaned that the Braun shaver will perform for many more days on a battery charge than other shavers.&lt;br /&gt;As for the replacement head, it fit my shaver perfectly and it does, indeed, shave closer than my 4 year old original head. Perhaps the next time I won&#x27;t wait quite as long. :)&lt;br /&gt;April 18, 2012: I just replaced the shaver foil on my Braun after 2 1/2 years of use on the previous replacement. The old foil was still doing the job, however, due to a slight change in design, the new head does a better job. My Braun 7505 shaver is now about 6 1/2 years old and still functions perfectly. You can&#x27;t beat that kind of durability. I shave 2 or 3 times a day and still manage to run about 2 weeks or more on a battery charge.</li>
    <li> My Dad takes Coumadin and is not allowed to shave with a razor. I purchased a Braun electric razor. This item is needed to maintain maximum working  condition of the electric shaver. It is wonderful to find an on line store to order it and have it sent to my father&#x27;s home. It is from Braun and I am assured that  my Dad&#x27;s shaver will continue to work well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the second time that I buy this product, simply it&#x27;s great to obtain a soft and elegant shave.</li>
    <li> Nice performance difference when you replace these regulary. They are inexpensive and do a good job.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace and these parts make my electric work so much better. Took me all of 5 minutes to pop the old ones out and replace them (just don&#x27;t forget which ones are the old and new like i did) will keep my razor working for a long time and at a much cheaper price than buying a new one.</li>
    <li> Order was completed and shipped right away, will order from this vendor in the future. Many thanks.</li>
    <li> This shaver is the first one I  bought and kept.  Usually I find them, try them, take them back and back to the razor.  This time I did keep this shavor.   It cleans itself, its cordless, and its close.  Im a bit overweight so it takes a few runs to get real close on parts of my face but I love it.  Its well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my original blades were.  I mostly bought this kit to replace the micro screen.  My old one had a hole worn in it and the shaver was cutting me.  Since it came with the new blade, I replaced both.  What a difference!  If anything, the shaver works better than new now.</li>
    <li> This replacement is not as good as the original head that came with the razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my synchro 8585 based on other reviews.  The plastic color is black where the original was silver so I deducted one star but fit is perfect.  I cannot remember what came with my Braun originally but this is definitely a better shave than the 8000 Series replacement I bought last time.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d this &amp; noticed it looked different from the Syncro foil I was replacing.  Upon looking at it with a magnifying glass, it has the \\&quot;honeycomb\\&quot; pattern used on the Activator series of shavers!  It gives a better shave and I was pleased to be able to update and upgrad my Syncro to the new Activator performance.  Cutter block looks the same (but has for years).</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my original screen and cutter.  It is far superior to the original pieces and I would definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> This is weird. The foil part didn&#x27;t fit my 7505 Braun razor. The shape of the actual foil I got is slightly different not only from my old piece, but it is also different from the picture on this site and even from the picture on the package it was in!</li>
    <li> Back of the packaging: \\&quot;Fits all 7000 series shavers\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Frustratingly, not the case at all. Does not fit the 7526.</li>
    <li> They defenitely changed the design.   I purchased this item, disappointed and returning the item back.  I guess it is razor and shaving creams and burning after shaves after all.  I wish I read the comments before I purchased.  All I thought was 4 stars, got to be good.</li>
    <li> My husband requested I buy a new set of foil/cutters for his synchro and this made the razor just like a new one again!</li>
    <li> This replacement blade/screen fits my 7526 model Braun shaver - no problem.  But, I find the precision of the product has dropped over the last 2 years.    Removing (to clean) the blades and then replacing them and replacing the screen overtop, the fit seems less sure; i.e., before I could snap the blades and screen  right into place. But, the last 2 replacement set of parts take more effort to keep the parts from jamming or mis-assembling.    I guess it&#x27;s just a sign of the times.  The parts work, but the quality has not been there in the last 2 years or so.</li>
    <li> When should you buy this? When your Braun razor foil cover is wearing down after a year and a half of use. If you shave and it feels like the razor is pulling your hair out, then this will do the trick.  Subscribe-and-save with this to get a 15% discount and shipped free!</li>
    <li> I had been shaving with my original screen (7-8 years), which had a small hole in it that was getting bigger.  The new cutter that came with this screen, which I didn&#x27;t think I really needed, has proven to be the key to my \\&quot;like new\\&quot; razor now.  I don&#x27;t remember having a smoother shave before, even when my razor was brand new.  I would recommend this replacement combo to anyone with this series of a razor over buying a new razor. Great quality, great price (better than local stores).</li>
    <li> fast and convenient not blood</li>
    <li> I love this replacemnt! IT&#x27;s absolutly fantastic! I got it on time, it came to me in one piece (although they could have wrapped it a little bit better..), but I enjoy it now and it really needed this replacmnet, my Braun shaver. It shaves my face a lot better and closer now. Good going Partsbiz! Keep up the good delivery!</li>
    <li> This replacement razor works well with my razor and so far has been great.  As long as it lasts just as long as the original razor (5 years!) then I&#x27;ll be a very happy guy.</li>
    <li> Not sure why everyone else has such bad results from the foils.  I am now buying new ones after owning the originals for 13-14 months, and I am buying only because it&#x27;s time for me to get new cleaning fluid.  Only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it shaves REALLY close for a shaver, just not as close as a blade.  Otherwise, extremely happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have shaved with a blade for many years and about four years ago it began to really irritate my skin. Bought a Remington and was not really happy with it, but it was acceptable. When that razor crashed and burned, big time, I got smart and researched electric razors eventually settling on the Braun 7680 which uses this 7000 replacement foil &amp; cutter. &lt;br /&gt;For me the shave is great. While I do seem to make more passes over my face than with the Remington, the shave is closer. As another reviewer has said, a blade will give a closer shave, but I am extremely happy with this system. The shaves are close, the battery last significantly longer than the Remington&#x27;s did, and even given the evidence here, the foils last longer than the Remington&#x27;s and are less expensive. Of course the cleaning cartridge is an additional cost, but I am certainly happy with its results.</li>
    <li> Maybe it is my face. I have thick facial hair and it takes only 2 days to get real thick. The Braun Syncro blades do a good job of getting the hair close to the face. Unfortunately I still need to use a razor for that baby bottom feel. I don&#x27;t mind using the electric and the razor together because I have less irritation using both. So all in all these blades do the job. They work perfectly for my dad who has finer facial hair than me. Thumbs up to Braun for they always make  great products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had various Braun razors since I was in bootcamp almost 15 years ago and my company commander required my face to be cleanshaven at all times.  This meant I had to shave 4 times a day.  The toll that took on my face with even a good blade razor was awful, and I only survived by eventually switching over to a Braun rechargable that shaved almost as close as a blade but with far less damage.    I&#x27;ve been a solid Braun customer ever since. Unfortunately, while consumer magazines tout electric razors as a money-saving tool, Gillette (the owner of the Braun brand for several years) has done a marvelous job migrating Braun customers to buy disposable replacement parts.  The cleaning system that comes with most new Brauns is a great way to get an annuity stream from customers who mistakenly thought they could buy a Braun and be done with spending money.    While the value of the cleaning system replacements is sketchy, the 7000FC replacement combo isn&#x27;t.  After anywhere between 6 and 12 months of use, the foil on a Braun typically gets one or two small holes.  These end up giving you nasty, painful small cuts.  The cutter too wears down a bit.  I notice when I replace both shaving my entire face takes probably 30% less time and is generally closer.  Well worth buying.    One other note.  This product is a great reason to sign up for Amazon Prime.  Repeated free two day shipping on a product at a substantial discount to stores - I don&#x27;t know how Amazon makes money on these transactions, but I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;re letting us do them!</li>
    <li> The old parts were well past their prime and the foil screen began to develop larger holes so the razor was performing surgery on my face.  The new parts were easy to install and my razor behaves like it did when it was new.  Oh Happy Day!</li>
    <li> works better than the foil/cutting block that came with the product. the new foil seems to let more hair in at each pass which allows for fewer passes to get the same results.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun razors for years. I have never replaced the foil before. My foil began to wear out so that it had holes and the sharp edges would cut my face. I do not know if they are making the foils thinner. In any case, it was an easy fix.</li>
    <li> I have to shave my husbands beard each day.  He is handicapped. The Braun is the easiest shaver I have used.  It was getting dull and pulling his whiskers.  The new replacement combo has eliminated this and I am about ready to order another replacement to have on hand. &lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This was the best price after searching local and internet sellers. Fast service and exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Just got it few days ago.  The blade can fit in my Braun 7526, but the cutter block won&#x27;t fit.  So, if you want to buy this to replace yours, maybe you are going to have another useless cutter block. It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> THE FOIL DOESN&#x27;T FIT MY SHAVER AS THE AD SAID IT WOULD. HAD TO BY A FOIL ELSE WHERE. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT FOR THE BRUAN 7526</li>
    <li> I purchased the new combo set because the original screen would not stay locked in on my 7526 Braun Shaver. The shave is fine...takes a little longer than a razer but, I have a tough beard!</li>
    <li> Great purchase makes my shaver like new again. This is the second set I have purchased. Should change parts about every 18 months. Cheaper than a new shaver.</li>
    <li> The blade was very easy to replace and works well.  It is not exactly like the one that came with my Braun 7526, but it fits well enough.  The mesh over the top is in a different pattern that I don&#x27;t think works as well as the original one, but you can&#x27;t go wrong with a fresh blade.</li>
    <li> Although the part numbers have changed over the years, this foil / blade combination fits my Braun shaver. I typically get two or three years of use out of these blades. This new set made the shaver feel like brand new again. I always store the shaver in the charger / cleaning base. The programed cleaning probably addes to the longevity of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changing the blades is super simple. Pry off the foil by the plastic base. Pull on the coiled cutter cartridge. Snap in the new cartridge, and snap the foil over that. Takes all of two minutes even when I haven&#x27;t done this for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0009RL86E Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refills (3 Pack)]]</li>
    <li> Purchased the kit for the long overdue replacement (according to the manufacturer)of the original blade and comb set, to find that the new  required considerably more time and effort to shave as closely, as the old. Guess I should have ordered the parts specifically for my Model 7526  instead of going for what appeared to be a newer (at least the comb portion) kit, which is probably for the newer models.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for my old razor head. Cant beat it. It just snapped right on and I was off shaving again!</li>
    <li> I got this for my Braun 7505 shaver.  It fit perfectly and shaves like new.  I could not believe the difference from the old shaver head and the new one.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace my current foil and the new design gives me an even closer shave then the previous foil I had and the product arrived days before Amazon said it would.</li>
    <li> Good replacement blades.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the original blade and foil on my Braun 7680, and it made it better than new! The revised irregular pattern makes for a much more consistent shave with fewer missed hairs. Just don&#x27;t forget the &#x27;lectric pre-shave face conditioner.</li>
    <li> Of course I&#x27;ve been using my Braun for 5 years and did not replace the head once ... you know how it goes. I finally replaced it few weeks ago - it was very quick and easy. I&#x27;m beating my head that i did not replace it years ago - it really improves the shaving a lot.</li>
    <li> First, two stars probably isn&#x27;t fair since I put this on a model this is not intended for.  I followed the recommendations of several others here at Amazon reviews and purchased this for my 8595 shaver.  Supposedly this would improve the performance of the shaver like it was originally.  It did fit the 8595 but the clear plastic cover no longer fit over it to protect the head when not in use.  At first it seemed like an improvement as the blades are in fact like the original replacement (very thin cutters versus the thicker cutters now in use), but after three months of trying to like this set, I purchased the correct 51S model for my 8595.  The problem for me was that this cutter would miss longer hairs unless I really stretched my skin tight.  I also saw no improvement in speed - it still took the same amount of time to shave each day.  This cutter did seem to irritate my skin less, but I am thinking that this might have been because it was not getting as close...    Now I do have very coarse hairs on my face, so that may be part of the problem, but I figured this info might be helpful to others too.  So if you have a 8000 series, this cutter will fit, but it may not get the great results that others here are reporting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problems with using this replacement combo from Braun.  It seems to last about 9-12 months before needing a replacement.</li>
    <li> I was looking for cutter and foil replacement for my Activator 8595 and could not find the original one any more. Braun has replaced that with a foil &amp; cutter from series 5 shavers and as you read the reviews the shape of the cutter is different from the original series 8 cutters. Somebody suggested to use series 7000 foil and cutter instead, which is this item. The cutter is exactly looking the same as the original 8595 cutter but the foil BODY is colored BLACK (for 7000 series) instead of SILVER (for 8000 series) which was not an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;Now my 8595 shaver is back to its original performance and I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to all who put useful reviews on Amazon.</li>
    <li> After over a year using the original head, the superb close shave was restored by replacing the original with this head (foil &amp; cutter). Like a new razor!</li>
    <li> When I was looking for a replacement part for my 7000 series Braun electric razor, the part I ordered stated that it fit ALL 7000 series Braun electric razors as a replacement head and the picture looked the same as the head I needed to replace.  The connectors on the head would not fit my razor and I had to return an opened package.  Without opening the blister pack, there was no way of knowing whether or not it would fit.  This of course affects the amount of refund available.</li>
    <li> I bought this replacement cutter and foil on Ebay, and it didn&#x27;t fit my 7505.  Thinking the seller had made an error, I purchased another one, only to see that it didn&#x27;t fit either.  I called Braun customer service, as someone suggested in a previous review.  They said it was probably a packaging error, and they would gladly send me a new cutter &amp; foil for free.  Two weeks later, I received a letter in the mail from Procter &amp; Gamble (I suppose they own Braun now) saying it was good to be able to serve me, and a $2.00 coupon for a Fabreeze Candle was attached.  Nice.</li>
    <li> I purchased a 7000 series Braun back in 2001.  I used the cleaning system for about a year, but started to just clean the razer with dry methods, (brush, take foil off and tap, etc.).  I change the blades about once a year.  I use it daily on a thick beard.  Over the weekend I typically don&#x27;t shave and revert back to a wet blade shave...the Braun just can&#x27;t get through after 3 days growth.  I could not make a higher recommendation for the Braun Syncro.  The battery will even last several shaves which is amazing being that it&#x27;s over 10 years old, but I typically keep it plugged in for the extra power.  Take care of the razor, replace the foil and cutter once a year, and you will not be disappointed.  I&#x27;ve probably saved hundreds in standard blades and shaving cream over the years....and my face doesn&#x27;t get sliced up when you try to hastily use that blade when you&#x27;re running late.</li>
    <li> Braun razor replacement parts for this particular model are difficult to find.  Amazon is one source that I rely on.</li>
    <li> I bought this one to replace my orginal set but they are not as good ! After three weeks of use I think the are becoming less and less sharp. Also, the color is different. My shaving machine is grey but these are black.</li>
    <li> Braun recommends replacing these items every 18 months. The original set that came with the razor only lasted about 11 months before a hole appeared in the foil that resulted in painful pinching and pulling of my skin. The replacement combo fixed it right up like new.</li>
    <li> The new 7000 series blad I purchases was better then the one I had. Its a smoooth experience</li>
    <li> I replace mine about every 5 months to make sure i keep a close shave going</li>
    <li> This replacement is almost as good as the original the razor shipped with. It&#x27;s very easy to replace.</li>
    <li> VERY PRICEY!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just as ordered. Perfect.</li>
    <li> Its always like using a new shaver.  I guess I should change them a bit more often, huh?  Works great.  Arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> I replaced my foil and cutter this week, and I noticed that they&#x27;ve changed the design of the foil.    The older ones have staggered holes. The newer one has more of a honey-comb pattern, the result is there is more area for hairs to get cut!    This is also the design of foil they use on the newer \\&quot;Activator\\&quot; shaver, and quite frankly, the only significant design change between the old \\&quot;Syncro\\&quot; and the new \\&quot;Activator\\&quot; and even the new \\&quot;5-series\\&quot;    So by offering us this new foil desin, Braun has effectively upgraded our shavers at no additional charge. Score!    I do see somebody else has noticed this change. They are complaining, saying that the old foil is better, and less prone to breaking. I guess we&#x27;ll see if my foil develops small holes in it or not, but so far I&#x27;m happy.    If it does, there actually *is* a place on the web that sells Braun parts, and will sell you just a foil, for about $12. I know because I accidently broke one of my other foils when the cutter-block was only a week or two old.</li>
    <li> My razor works like new now!!</li>
    <li> Product came 2 days quicker than stated.  Fit my razor perfectly and now my razor is as good as new if not better.</li>
    <li> I am prompted to comment on my shaver system because on ordering replacement parts I happened to read other users remarks. The shaver is great, but the cleaning part is garbage. I notice that they are now selling a replacement cleaner for 50.00. I take some comfort in knowing that I&#x27;m not alone, being one of many who is dissatisfied with this product. Meanwhile I will clean my razor by hand.     Harold E</li>
    <li> This should have been a very simple purchase of replacement parts.  However, Braun has seen fit to redesign the screen pattern on the foil.  This provided a noticeably less close shave in combination with the new cutter block as soon as I used it.  I put the old foil back on (but kept the new cutter block), and the closeness of the shaver improved immediately.    So, looks like I&#x27;m using the old foil until it gives up the ghost.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for my 8000 series and was not happy on the reviews of the new style. I came across Jason Klein&#x27;s suggestion that we use this assembly instead and thought I would give it a try. The cutter worked very well for me.  I still have to see how long it lasts. I&#x27;ll try to update. At this point I am happy I tried Jason&#x27;s advice.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quick and without any problems.  I recommend this site for future purchases.</li>
    <li> I love the Braun electric shavers.  Needed to replace the cutting block and foil.  Saved approx. $8.00 by purchasing this item.  Would order again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Syncro shaver--it&#x27;s the first one that I&#x27;ve owned that doesn&#x27;t rip up my face and still keeps everything close.&lt;br /&gt;However, these foils are junk.  This is the third foil I&#x27;ve had to buy in the past six months.  I use it only in my bathroom, so it&#x27;s either shaving my face or sitting in the cleaning apparatus--it&#x27;s not bouncing around in a glove compartment or anything like that.  Nonetheless, it develops holes in the foil that allow the blades to make contact with my face, which feels GREAT.  Bloody mess, anyone?...</li>
    <li> I like the Braun Synchro shaver because it cleans itself and is cordless, etc. However, I am a bit disappointed with the cost of replacement cleaning fluid and replacement foil/cutter. I am now replacing the foil and cutter because the foil has developed large holes, even though I clean regularly as instructed per the manufacturer. Also, I do not get as close of a shave with the Braun Synchro as I do with a cheap, disposable razor and shaving cream.    Update 6/19/2005:  I switched over to a Norelco Specrta 8895XL one year ago. I am still using the original cutter heads, and it has been a breeze to periodically clean with just running water. Also, the battery lasts over a month between charges. I am quite happy to no longer be replacing the cutterhead (and cleaning solution) so often, as I needed to with the Braun.</li>
    <li> The foil I got does not fit my 7570.  This is annoying...</li>
    <li> I really needed a new blade/screen for my shaver but the local retail stores either didnt have the correct part or it was overly priced... Out of curiousity I browsed Amazon for the part and saw it was available (for cheap!) I placed an order and I received the parts within a week...I will def be purchasing more parts in the future!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my 5-year-old razor that tore it&#x27;s screen.  The part arrived on schedule and in good shape.  It installed easily and worked flawlessly.</li>
    <li> Never let it be said that electric shaving saves you money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But, as one that can&#x27;t really be bothered wet shaving, plus when I do I cut myself to shreds, I have to say this is the best system I&#x27;ve owned and it&#x27;s worth swapping the foil way more often than the 18 months mentioned in the manual; I tend to only go 3-6 months before swapping and I can really notice the difference. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The other way I generally extend the life of these foils is, if like me you don&#x27;t shave over the weekend, when Monday morning comes, use the clippers on the shaver to cut your growth down to a stubble and then shave; I find this gives a better cut and a cleaner shave after that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So - a good product but could be tougher (it should last longer than 6 months) and could be less expensive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Happy shopping &lt;br /&gt;JB</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the other reviewers had such bad luck with their foils.  Mine never crack or perforate.  The cutter block is the limiting factor; it does get dull after no more than 18 months, and sometimes as few as 12.  I&#x27;ve been using shavers with these foils for about 8 years now, so I have a fair amount of experience with them.</li>
    <li> The new blade makes a shave as quick and close as when the shaver was new. My only concern is whether the blade will provide this performance for 18 months as suggested and some earlier blade replacements and the original blade did, or has my beard toughened as I have further matured since the previous blade only provided good performance for about 6 months. The blade that provided about 6 months of good performance was my third or fourth replacement, so at least you can tell the shaver itself has good longevity.</li>
    <li> I received the replacement cutter and screen today and they fit just fine in my Syncro 7526.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement. Makes your shaver as good as when you first purchased it. For everyday light use, I&#x27;d say my last one lasted more than 12 months.</li>
    <li> Current combo is definately a significant improvement over the original foil and does a better job shaving.  With free shipping (you may need other items to get to $25) it is the best deal I could find</li>
    <li> It can be really hard to find these replacement parts so when I found them on Amazon I was thrilled.  This shaver is the best I have ever owned and I only need to replace the heads every 18 months or so, and having them delivered to my door is great!</li>
    <li> My husband does not like them. They are too expensive and last only a short time. They must have been made in China!&lt;br /&gt;Inge B.</li>
    <li> I had to replace mine after only 6 months of use (not 18 months like instructions say) - it had large holes in the screen.  I called Braun (1-800-braun11) and they said the only way that happens is if you apply too much pressure when shaving (which I don&#x27;t).  They will send a free replacement if you call though.</li>
    <li> You get exactly what you&#x27;d expect from the new blades!! They work great, and now you don&#x27;t have to go out and spend another $200+ on a new electric razor!</li>
    <li> OEM Replacement or spare razor foil, works like new easy to replace.</li>
    <li> These parts replace my shaver cutting block and foil.  The biggest thing for me is that even with shipping and handling it was considerably cheaper than anywhere else (Online and in-store).  It&#x27;s also easier to find some parts online anyway due to stores not stocking everything you may need.</li>
    <li> I got my Braun 7000 series shortly before the 8000 series came out, and the only shortcoming was the difficulty it had picking up the flat-lying whiskers on my neck.  The first time I replaced the foil, I wondered if the redesigned foil for the 8000 series would fit, but opted not to chance it.  So I was pleasantly surprised when my second replacement had the new design, and I&#x27;m amazed how much better it works.  No problem with neck hairs, and much more comfortable overall.  I suspect that the new design is less prone to developing gaps as well.  Good on you, Braun!</li>
    <li> Really works just as it is supposed to.  Second time I have bought this kit and have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I noticed the advertised 25% improvement in shaving closeness.  I have had my Braun Syncro shaver for about 10 years.</li>
    <li> They sent me my razor replacement combo the same day I ordered it and it arrived in the mail a few days later.  You cannot beat that speed. The product itself was as advertised and it is working great.</li>
    <li> Arguably the best foil model(my preference) electric since Sunbeam. However, I use it before a cartidge type blade razor to cut against the grain, since my blade razor is too painful against the grain.  The combination leaves my face smooth and refreshed. Synchro alone is moderately OK especially since I don&#x27;t go dancing cheek to cheek anymore.</li>
    <li> This product was great once I could get it. Amazon wouldn&#x27;t ship overseas so I had to have it sent to a stateside address and then have it shipped to me in Iraq. I will order it through someone else next time I need it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband and he liked it.  I watched him changed the new Syncro on his old shaver and it took less than a minute.  The replacement process was very easy and simple.  My husband tried the new Syncro immediately and he said it felt like a new shaver.</li>
    <li> This is the third screen that I have put on my Braun shaver. Braun changed the design of the screen openings and the result is a much more comfortable shave than before.</li>
    <li> Not sure why a few folks post that it did not fit the 7200.  It was a perfect fit and now no more scratches on my face from the worn foil.  I&#x27;m happy with the price</li>
    <li> the trimmer part of the shave has broken because a spring popped out, so I discarded the entire the razor.</li>
    <li> This is the second or third time I have ordered the replacement blade and screen. Every time they have arrived on time and in great shape.</li>
    <li> Be warned Braun changed the item. It comes in the same package, but now the foil head is smaller. It no longer fits my 7505. I notified Amazon.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is so frustrating. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Like previous reports - The blades are OK but the screen has new design and will not fit the 7680 model I have. I&#x27;ve bought this same item in the past with no problems. Apparently Braun did a mistake or a careless redesign.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t wait until your current blade breaks (like I did):  this replacement combo restores the razor to its original cutting ability.  My bet is you&#x27;ve forgotten how efficient your razor was when you first purchased it.  Buy this replacement (it&#x27;s cheap) and you&#x27;ll be reminded.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the replacement combo pack, the pieces fit like a charm and the shipping was prompt.</li>
    <li> great item it was cheaper than if i went to a local store and bought it</li>
    <li> Got this replacement for my shaver, which I had for about 2 years. The foil is different, and works about ten times better! It is so awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice.  The shield piece I was using had broken and was starting to scratch my face.  Nice to know you can order replacement parts w/o having to purchase a whole new razor.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for a while and stopped using it because it was starting to hurt. I didn&#x27;t realize I should have replaced the blade a while ago. I bought this replacement and feel in love with this razor all over again. I think it works better then when I bought it. The new foil design and higher quality blade design make this so much better than the OEM version.</li>
    <li> This is a must to keep your Syncro working great! Everytime I change this, it cuts like brand new! And I&#x27;m sure you all remember what that was like!</li>
    <li> Easy install, stays sharp, probably good for a couple of years of daily use before it starts to show signs of dullness.</li>
    <li> These replacement parts were easy to snap in and use and now my razor works great again.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied when using vendors associated with Amazon.  Speed with delivery and knowledge that my purchase is secure is always priority one.</li>
    <li> I purchased some really CHEAP ones from one vendor. They fell apart on use. Be sure to get genuine Braun parts.</li>
    <li> Was a perfect gift for my son. It was like getting a new razor. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> The Braun replacement was everything as advertised. Purrfect match. It replaced a 10 year old foil that had sprung holes.</li>
    <li> Braun&#x27;s foil is very fragile, but for a reason.  The foil is very thin to give a closer shave.  It&#x27;s simply too thin to clean with a brush, even the one supplied with the shaver.  My advice: Don&#x27;t touch it with anything.  Clean it with the automatic cleaner that comes with most of the shavers.  If you&#x27;re traveling light and don&#x27;t have access to the cleaning apparatus, carefully remove the foil by the plastic sides, then tap it gently on a counter.  Use the brush on the cutters, but not the foil.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like shaving in the morning as much as the next guy.  Having a great rechargeable like this Braun makes it as painless as possible and gives me a great shave everytime!  Best electric I have ever used with regularity.</li>
    <li> What else are you going to buy if you have a Braun shaver (The best shavers out there)?</li>
    <li> I have changed cutters on my shaver 3 times so far and it does make a big difference and the cuts in the head have to be replaced since it realy does hurt your face when you shave with it. So you either have to buy a new one or replace the head, I don&#x27;t know why mine has been cut every year or so but it sure beats spending about 100-120 for a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Replaced my shaver foil and blades - very quick easy work.    The foil is the new design, holes aren&#x27;t just round...more triangular for making it \\&quot;better for grabbing hair from various angles\\&quot;.  So that was a nice surprise.    Made my shave faster and closer.   My first set lasted like two years+.</li>
    <li> The Braun 7000FC Syncro Replacement Combo pack makes it easy and convenient to get your Braun into like new condition. Just unsnap the foil head, pop off the old blade, snap on the new and replace the foil head. In seconds you will have a like new shaver and you will be shaving with much less time and effort. What could be easier. Buy two and save on shipping that way you will have a spare on hand in case you need to replace a part.</li>
    <li> If you like this razor, an annual replacement of this combo is important; otherwise you just have an expensive noisemaker/hair puller.</li>
    <li> the holes have been redesigned from the original (uniform,  circular) to be more random and oval.  This seems to allow for a smoother shaving experience with less burning.</li>
    <li> I have been using this new foil for about a dozen times now. It&#x27;s like having a brand new razor all over again, a much closer and smoother shave than with the old foil.</li>
    <li> Reviewer&#x27;s are correct. The original replacement part for the Braun SyncroPro 7505 has been replaced at least twice by other models. Most appliance parts stores are wrong with what they try to sell. Contact Braun (The Essentials) directly for the replacement combo &amp; get the Braun Series 3, 30B for this SyncroPro. The rep on the phone knows this stuff inside out. The bar code # is 69055 85400.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation is a snap &amp; it works great.</li>
    <li> Seller did not send the 7000 series. I received the series 3 which also fits my shaver, but not what I ordered. If I wanted the series 3 I could have purchased this for $19.26. So I would call this a bait and switch rip off. The series 3 is a much lower quality replacement. It will snag your mustache if you get too close, not at all like the 7000 series.</li>
    <li> Works Well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a direct replacement for the cutter block on my 7256, and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this.</li>
    <li> Hey, it&#x27;s a razor cutting head; how exciting can it be? It is made by Braun and fits the Braun.</li>
    <li> did not seem to be as good as orginial when razor was purchased but was a good value for the money</li>
    <li> I love charging up my old braun electric razor and putting new blades in it. It&#x27;s like a buzzsaw!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of little pieces on these and I can see why they are expensive. They are made in Germany and hold up well over a year. I used to use the cleaning solution on them but hitting them against the inside of the sink bowl keeps them in service well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying these as long as my braun holds up. It&#x27;s almost 15 years old now!</li>
    <li> This blade set is better thant the orignal blades that came with my razor. I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and would tell anyone who needs a replacement to get it</li>
    <li> This is the most convenient way to get this item. Very good price as well.</li>
    <li> My husband prefers this product and appreciates that he could order and receive it so promptly.</li>
    <li> My electric shaver is again working like new after buying this product. I received it promptly and I was happy with its quality and price.</li>
    <li> I have purchased these replacements for my 7526 twice now. once in 2005 and recently in Dec 2008. I have gotten the correct part each time. The reviews that state that this will not fit are old and it seems as if the problem has been resolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I decided to go the rout of replacing the blade and foil instead of buying a new razor. the 7526 is the best razor that I have had. Those new razors are expensive so I plan on using this one until dies.</li>
    <li> I should have done this long ago. I&#x27;ll change them out every year from now on. It&#x27;s like having a completely new razor. I think i have a 7050 or something like that. Replacement parts worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  The Braun 7000 razor series is awesome and with a new blade &amp; foil, you&#x27;re back to that nice, clean, comfortable shave.    This product works as adverstised!  Great value!</li>
    <li> This replacement pack used to work with Braun Series 7 (799CC model) and I&#x27;ve ordered it multiple times. I used this one because it was better than their other advertised replacement pack. Sometime in about the last year and a half, this part has changed (but the name of the item has stayed the same) and it no longer will fit the razor. So, not pleased with this of course...</li>
    <li> As there are no other options, one has no other choice than to like this replacement set. I bought my Braun shaver in Germany some 15 years ago and the only repair to date was a renewal of the chargeable batteries and the foil/cutter set every 18 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for more than 15 years, and it just keeps on ticking! I love it! All it needs is a cutter block and foil combo occassionally!</li>
    <li> Great product. I love the fact that the blades and screen seem to be improved over the factory installed combo. Shaves very well and does not pull hairs whatsoever. Provides a very smooth shave indeed!</li>
    <li> Easy to replace and works like new. I&#x27;m very satisfied. Beats buying a new shaver. I&#x27;m going to buy one on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Durability and close shaves for 11+ years without irritation associated with standard razors. Ease of use and maintenance is also a plus.</li>
    <li> This product was just what I needed to get my razor back to new. I will order again in 18  months</li>
    <li> This fit my son&#x27;s 7000 series razor perfectly.  I shopped the best price and was surprised to find that was from Ireland!</li>
    <li> To keep my Braun shaver, and my face - happy - having these parfts available and replaced every 18months is essential.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by numerous posters as a better replacement for the new block and foil for the synchro shaver. It delivers a closer shave than the &amp;#34;redesigned&amp;#34; block/foil set intended for use with the 8585.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve had many shavers that were so so. Three years ago I got a Braun through Amazon and WOW! is it great. After using it every year and a half I get the cutter replacement through Amazon and it goes back from great to fantastic.</li>
    <li> This product truly renews the ease and effectiveness of the razor when replaced regularly every 18 months.  I have been able to use my electric razor for close to 10 years now with no maintenance other than replacing the cutter block and foil regularly.  A large return for such a small investment!</li>
    <li> Love the closeness these new blades give my morning shave.  No need to Feel the Burn.  Perfect fit for my 7526.  Love It!</li>
    <li> THIS COMBO IS WHAT I NEEDED (THE FOIL ON MY RAZOR HAD A HOLE IN IT) AND I LOOKED TO AMAZON AS I HAD IN THE PAST TO REPLACE IT.....THANKS</li>
    <li> This is a necessary replacement to keep shaving clean and smooth. If you use your Braun razor a couple of years you will need it.</li>
    <li> Braun used to be a German company.  German company &#x3D; high quality.  Now it has been bought out by Proctor &amp; Gamble, a big American conglomerate.  American companies are cost cutting zealots.  Their motto is &amp;#34;the cheaper the better&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s basically a race to the bottom.  I used to think Braun was a great company.  The first version of their razor heads lasted nearly 18 months, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, the outside foil (or mesh looking curved metal sheets) had a specific pattern.  Well they changed that pattern in the 2nd (cheaper) version.  Yes, the 1st version was a long time ago, perhaps, more than 10 years.  However, for 2nd version of razor head, they also changed the teeth pattern on the center spine of the razor head to a thicker tooth essentially reducing the # of slots in between each tooth.  And, they reduced the length of the teeth.  Thus, there was an overall reduction of shaving effectiveness.  (I pay attention to details and the very first time i recevied version 2 in the mail, i immediately noticed it.)  Also the 2nd version probably only lasted 8 months at most.  2nd version came out probably 5 or 6 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the 3rd version of razor of same razor head is EVEN CHEAPER!!! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT!!!  The foil seems to be identical, but the inside razor blade has been cheapened.  if you notice the circular blades, which form 2 rows, the blades themselves have been thinned out.  That is to say that the old blade(s) were actually made from a thicker metal.  it seems that the old blades were cut from seemingly solid metal, whereas the new blades seems to be sheet metal.  Furthermore, the sheet metal seems to be wider, thus it seems to reduce the total # of cutting edges/blades because wider individual sheets of blade in the same given space, means less overall blade edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again Braun Proctor &amp; Gamble, former German, now American company has cheapened 3rd version as compared to 2nd.  I&#x27;m waiting for cheaper even still version 4.  But i probably won&#x27;t wait cuz i wont buy it.  But if i dont buy it, what the HELL DO I BUY?  Do i buy some crazy expensive boutique brand that costs like an arm and a leg?  (I saw one brand on the internet that looks like a Ferrari, seriously!!! but costs like a Ferrari too.)  or do i buy some ultra cheapo commercial brand that you can find in a big box store, that knicks and cuts you and lasts less than a year?  IS THIS AMERICAN CAPITALISM AT ITS BEST?</li>
    <li> Good price, easy to find right product</li>
    <li> Had my doubts because it doesn&#x27;t look the same, but works perfectly, item came on time. would do it again.</li>
    <li> This is the second seller that has sent me the crappier 30B model instead of the one pictured AND is a different part number than what is listed in THEIR product description!&lt;br /&gt;THEY ARE NOT THE SAME ! ! !&lt;br /&gt;On top of that it is not returnable!  WTF ! ! !&lt;br /&gt;Do The Right Thing is correct about the different versions.  I wish I could post a picture of the two items to show the difference.  The 7000FC has individual vertical blades that are spaced nicely to allow the hairs to get in and be cut effectively. The 30B uses a rolled over piece of sheet metal that has slots cut in it that are too narrow for the hairs to fit in efficiently giving an inferior and less comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;How can these sellers get away with substituting products without contacting the buyer first ? ? ?</li>
    <li> 4 of 5 because of price.  Not amazon&#x27;s fault but these things are stupid pricey.  But, works great.  Shave in half the time.  Plus shipping was very quick.</li>
    <li> This is just what my husband needed to keep his shaver going for a long time.  We live in the country and have to drive a long ways to shop so when we want something we shop Amazon and have not been disapppointed.</li>
    <li> after a  good five years ( at least ) of using my old shaver, it was time to replace the cutter and screen.. I should&#x27;ve done it a long time ago... it works like new now.. happy camper..</li>
    <li> I sent this as a gift to my younger brother.  The shipping was lightening fast.  He seems to be very happy with it.  He claims his face is much smoother!</li>
    <li> I love this shaver but haven&#x27;t replaced the cutter or foil since I bought it several years ago.  I&#x27;m kicking myself now for having dealt with the dull cutter for so long.  I will certainly replace them at least every 18 months from now on.  Well worth the price.  It now takes less than half the time to shave and I don&#x27;t expect to have to clean it as often - saving on the cleaning solution.  The new foil design is pretty slick and seems to provide more efficient shaving when moving the foil around in various angles.</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement the old screen and blade in my razor. This one fit perfectly and is working just as well as the old one did when it was new. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Glad I read the other Amazon reviews recommending this over the \\&quot;new replacement\\&quot; head combo for my Braun 8975 shaver. This head replacement set shaves great and costs less too. It fits perfectly and looks good also. Buy it; I am glad that I did.</li>
    <li> The blades are not the type that I got with the original shaver, but it is as good as the original one.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about how bad the 8000 Series cutters and foils were to I bought this one.  It works perfectly in my Braun 8585 shaver.  After two weeks and it&#x27;s still working wonderfully.  Get this cutter and foil for your 8000 Series shaver.</li>
    <li> Not very good does not cut my short hair very mad that didn&#x27;t work would love my money back thanks</li>
    <li> Have a 8500 and this makes it like new out of the box. Thanks for recommending this for my razor.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have ever used!!  Shaves close, and quickly.  Far superior to any razor that I had used in the past!!!</li>
    <li> The item pictured was the Braun 7000 Series Syncro Replacement Combo. The item I received is the Braun 30B Foil and Cutter, which, although it is compatible with the 7000 series, it contains a newer, cheaper cutter block. The 30B cutter block has wider blades, which are less effective than the older style blades.</li>
    <li> We had no luck finding the reoplacement head any where until we went on to Amazon.com.  My husband really likes the Braun and is delighted he was able to get the replacemnt.[[ASIN:B000050FDX Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro / Syncro Replacement Combo.</li>
    <li> This was never the item I requested. The cutter is not even the same shape as the one I wanted. I have just begun using the &amp;#34;substitute&amp;#34; and it is not as effective as the one I ordered and even has a different shape . I paid for the better cutter and got the &amp;#34;substitute&amp;#34; - fit&#x27;s all .</li>
    <li> I gave this item a bad ratings because it is NOT the claimed model listed as being sold!  This is the newer (and by many opinions poorer) design with blades oriented horizontally under the foil.  I cannot find the older vertical style block for my 8000-series anymore, and saw a review for that line stating the 7000-series fit, and that most of the 7000 series were the old style.  Disappointed with Braun for changing the design without offering alternatives (an electric shaver is quite the investment), and the seller for not updating information- giving me false hope of getting the old style block/blades.  I&#x27;ll keep and use these, but would have enjoyed seeing if the old kind cut better/last longer.</li>
    <li> I searched and searched everywhere for a foil to fit my husband&#x27;s Braun 7000 shaver.  I thought we&#x27;d have to chuck the razor at first until I went on Amazon and found exactly what we needed.  The product was delivered within two days and it fit perfectly.  I can&#x27;t say enough about Amazon.  They are AWESOME!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed. I am glad to have found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It fit perfectly on my old razor.</li>
    <li> It was a bit touch and go to make sure I was ordering the correct replacement......but it was the right one for my husband&#x27;s Braun shaver.  Made it just like new again.  Happy husband!</li>
    <li> This made my braun like new.  After 3 years of faithful service the blades were dull.  I should not have waited that long to change them.</li>
    <li> I bought this replacement based on other reviews. The blade fits my &#x27;newer model&#x27; shaver, but doesn&#x27;t cut near as close as the original. I still like the Braun over any other electric razor I have owned.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted. Thank you. I have no idea how the price compares to what I could get it for elsewhere and really don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> Husband loves his shaver but he didn&#x27;t realize that he could replace the blades and screen had a tougher time shaving.  Now his shaver is better than new since replacements parts are an updated design.  Fast service, price and delivery.</li>
    <li> ordered this based on other reviews on this replacement product working on an older model (# not handy).  works well and shaver works like new again.  suggest ordering additoinal &#x27;back-up&#x27; because we all know when they run out you&#x27;ll need to buy a new shaver.  worthwhile purchase - easy.</li>
    <li> I had been considering getting a new shaver.  This $30 investment pushes that thought into history.  I recommend the replacement combo totally.</li>
    <li> great! this is my fifth one.</li>
    <li> Makes a big difference having new shaving blade setup.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the package, the screen looked different than my old one. However when I fitted it to my razor, it installed perfectly. I am very happy with it. It gives me a close shave, thus extending the life of the electric razor I enjoy using. I would highly recommend this product to anyone else.  Considering the free shipping, which brought it to me quickly, the price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Received this product within two days and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and the product works well on my shaver, I like to keep the older shaver and keep it running since i&#x27;m so used to it now.</li>
    <li> This was bought for my son&#x27;s Braun.  He really didn&#x27;t a replacement head. We found this to be perfect for his shaver and a very fair price.</li>
    <li> The foil on my 7680 developed a small hole somehow and I didn&#x27;t see it until it was too late. What a painful and embarrassing mess that caused. I looked like a vicious cat attacked my face ... and I lost! This replacement set was a perfect match for my razor and it works like new again. I know there&#x27;s a similar product on here in different packaging that claims to be a replacement but it&#x27;s not getting good reviews. This one is perfect (at least for the 7680).</li>
    <li> Love this razor...owned it over 10 years and change the foil every few years and the quality it such that it is like new again...</li>
    <li> The original foil lasted about 6 months.  The replacement I ordered was advetised to last 18 months; however it only lasted 6 months.  Braun should sell the foil and the cutter separately.</li>
    <li> I purchased this some time ago as to fulfill the $50 rebate offer (oral/braun Amazon rebate) and let it sit on my drawer. Recently my foil broke and so I took these out. Amazing! These are better than the original foil &amp; blade! The foil fits nice and snug onto the razor and I am getting a remarkably smooth and quiet shave.</li>
    <li> It seems to clean easier than the original screen and performs excellent.</li>
    <li> ...and the quality of an electric shave is better when you replace the head and blade every 18 months as recommended.</li>
    <li> We have being looking for this item in all the stores where we bought the razor. So I went online and found your site and found what I needed and it worked very well. I will continue to buy through your site &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Excellent Razor - just had to replace head after so much use.  A bit costly.</li>
    <li> the best way to get your razor back to almost new performance.</li>
    <li> After not being able to find the earlier version of the cutter and foil for my old Braun model I decided to go with the 7000&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you hold the old vs new cutters together and compare them there is a slight difference in the size of the foil.  I bought this several months ago so I am sorry I can&#x27;t tell you exactly what the difference is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can tell you is is that the new foil cuts much closer.  So much so that I swapped them a few times to be sure, maybe it was the older one was worn but still I noticed it right away and hadn&#x27;t before when replacing older foils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other difference was that I was unable to get the new foil to work with the cleaning system until I moved it around in the cleaner a bit.  Also, when I removed the razor from the cleaner it had taken some of the finish off of the razor up by the foil.  Not that I care about that or that the foil is a different color, its the results that count and I will continue to use the 7000&#x27;s</li>
    <li> My cutter was delivered today. I thought I had bought, as I paid extra, the old style cutter and foil for the 7000 series Braun. The picture was not of the newer 30B version. In one week, this same item # is now being sold by another company so I cannot verify whether I simply didn&#x27;t view the picture well enough etc.  My seller was seneca river trading and now it is another company for the same item # so who knows. The picture (small one that needs to be enlarged) today does show the 30B model but the description does not mention it.  And the price is less today.</li>
    <li> I have used my old Braun for over a decade to keep my PENIS and TESTICLES smooth and hairless.  These replacement components bring the razor to a like-new performance which is important when you are grooming your MAN-MEAT.  :-)</li>
    <li> The foil does not fit Braun 7505. Do not buy until they fix it.</li>
    <li> My husband has used electric shavers all his adult life. He says that this razor (Braun) is the best he&#x27;s ever used. The cleaning and charging is simple and replacing this shield was also simple.</li>
    <li> Factory error for Braun 7000 series cutter and foil head replacement.  The bubble pack that comes from the factory contains a 5000 series foil head that will not fit a 7000 series shaver.  Amazon should send all the mismanufactured product back to the factory and list as out of stock until the situration is corrected.</li>
    <li> Cutterblock was fine but the screen was the wrong size. I had the correct series shaver that was supposed to fit this item.</li>
    <li> I had my old razor head for 2 years, and this was a much needed replacement.  Shaving takes less time, with less razor burn.</li>
    <li> My Braun refill order was sent as promised - on time and at right price</li>
    <li> While the replacement head is great, I find it quite interesting that Braun can not supply a new protective cover as part of a new head purchase.    I have lost mine and wanted a new one. I found one, but the cost would have been about $5-8 depending one where I looked and the postage.</li>
    <li> Product is fine, but I would not buy from this seller.  They told me it would ship immediately and then gave me a ship date of a week later.  Not terrible but not what I expect from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the replacement foil and cutter for the Braun Syncro line of men&#x27;s electric razors.  Braun recommends that you replace the set about once per year.  I am a gentle user and can get slightly more usage out of mine.  Your foil and cutter may also last longer if you lubricate your razor with something like Remington&#x27;s lubricant.  The Syncro&#x27;s cleaning system will also lubricate the blades for you; however, the cost of replacement cleaning cartridges make that an expensive option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, you do not want to wait until you have a hole in the foil to replace the set.  A hole in the foil can result in your face getting a cut from the oscillating blades beneath.  So please, change your foil and cutter set regularly.</li>
    <li> The Braun 7000 series is a great razor.  This new replacement foil head seems to have a more random hole pattern and perhaps a larger open to covered ratio.  This results in a better shave for me especially on neck hair.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Be wary of the 7000FC replacment assembly.  Much to my dismay, I went to purchase a replacement foil/cutter for my Syncro 7505 and found that Braun has changed the foil to the design used on the 8000-series shavers.  The old 7000 foil had a \\&quot;staggered grid\\&quot; pattern on smooth metal.  The new 7000 foil has the same \\&quot;overlapping circles\\&quot; pattern as the 8000-series foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a problem because my experience has shown that the 8000-series foil is exceptionally fragile/weak.  This problem results in a hole appearing in the foil within 2-20 weeks after replacement.  Here is a repeat of a review which I have placed in the Braun 8985 shaver category:&lt;br /&gt;----------------&lt;br /&gt;This is a followup to a review I previously posted about this product. It has become obvious that the foil on Braun 8000-series shavers is defective by design and/or manufacture because the foil goes bad WAY too often. I have used Braun 6000 and 7000 series shavers, and never had the bad experience I&#x27;ve had with the 8000-series shaver. I treat all my shavers carefully; nothing but my face, or tissue, touches the head. Here is my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oct 14 purchase a new Braun 8975&lt;br /&gt;Dec 15 hole appears in foil&lt;br /&gt;Dec 21 replace foil+cutter (from Braun customer service)&lt;br /&gt;Jun 02 hole appears in foil&lt;br /&gt;Jun 03 replace foil+cutter&lt;br /&gt;Jun 17 hole appears in foil after only 2 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, at $28-$40 for the 8000FC foil &amp; cutter assembly (you can&#x27;t buy the foil separately), this product has become way too expensive to maintain. I&#x27;m going to take a clue from CR, which rated the Remington Microscreen a best-buy in Jun 08, and try the Remington. Hopefully it won&#x27;t nickel-and-dime me to death.</li>
    <li> Replaced shaver foil &amp; cutter block on Braun 7680 after 18 months of use. There is an appreciable difference between the shave yesterday &amp; today. Much closer &amp; quicker. Seems less loud also. Foil &amp; frame fit much tighter. I may swap out sooner next time.  Medium coarse beard.  Shave 5-6 times a week.  Run it through the cleaner once a week.</li>
    <li> What a great savings!  The in-store price at a local \\&quot;super\\&quot; store was $29.99--Amazon&#x27;s price is $19.99.  Thanks for the great deal!!!</li>
    <li> - Replacement combo helps me delay the purchase of a new shaver.  The only concern I have is that it&#x27;s a bit price for the combo</li>
    <li> Simple replacement blades.  They work as expected (better than 2 year old blades).  However, any suggestions that I am emotionally attached to this product would be erroneous.</li>
    <li> perfect replacement. original shape, I am using it every day and it works perfectly. good purchase, I would do again</li>
    <li> My kids love the smoothness.</li>
    <li> Needed a replacement for my husband&#x27;s razor.  The last time we needed to replace the foil and cutting instruments it was very expensive.  The price was very reasonable and it was delivered very fast.  We were extremely satisfied with our purchase razor is just like new.</li>
    <li> The shaver hhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000050FDX/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_imgead came as promised and was delivered on time, at a wonderful price.  Totally satisfied.  This is the way ordering online should always flow.</li>
    <li> Quick, cheap and easy! That&#x27;s everything to me... If you want to save money, order theses. Make your life easier.</li>
    <li> upgrade your old shaver with new blades! my braun is  eleven years old, works every day, never complains, shows up ready to do the job.</li>
    <li> Excellent  item new in package. Great seller</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied with my purchase, and amazed how fast it arrived at my front door!  Would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> my fault on this. does not fit my husbands shaver.did finally get the correct one after a small mix up on the sellers part.customer service was very good.</li>
    <li> The new head made my razor just like new overall. I like the way it shaves now nice and close no nicks!</li>
    <li> Worth every penny.  Shaves great.  Nice and close. No burn.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  It keeps the razor in like new condition.  Get it!</li>
    <li> My razor works just like new !!!</li>
    <li> It was just what we were looking for! It arrived promptly and was just as described. Nice to be able to get it online!</li>
    <li> I have had my Braun electric razor for years and it was way overdue for a replacement combo on the blades. I was amazed at how smooth it was compared to before. Furthermore, while still expensive, this is the best price I have seen for this item. It was easy to replace with no hard to remove parts (just be careful when handling the blades).</li>
    <li> It guarantees a full year of daily shavings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always replace it every year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to Braun owners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made In Germany.</li>
    <li> Nice to not have the hole in the old screen anymore.  It is a different screen pattern then my original, but it worked just fine.  Had it shipped to me oversea to an APO address, and it arrived within 9 days which isn&#x27;t too bad for shipping overseas.</li>
    <li> My brother loves his Braun shaver and when he replaced the head it was like having a brand new razor.  We strongly recommend Braun shavers and especially this replacement combo. Our order arrived in record time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need to buy a new shaver, just replace the blade and screen. It will run for another year or two. Save BIG!!!</li>
    <li> Shaves well. Glad not to have to  spend a long time shaving. Pops of razer a bit too easy. thanks</li>
    <li> Was the perfect match for my old shaver. Works like new again.</li>
    <li> These replacement mesh and blade provides a refreshing shaving experience, especially if you run your equipment ragged like I do.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy these replacements and enjoy the smooth shave with less burns.</li>
    <li> Works great, made the razor like new. Cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> My husband was happy with this. No problems.</li>
    <li> Brand new razor again!!!&lt;br /&gt;Brand new razor again!!!&lt;br /&gt;!Brand new razor again!!!&lt;br /&gt;Brand new razor again!!!&lt;br /&gt;Brand new razor again!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I purchased my Braun 7526 Syncro Shaver over a year ago and I have yet to replace the foil or cutter block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is not thick; however the individual hairs on my face are thick, so I need a good shaver to do a good job.  Even though I have been shaving with the same foil and cutter block for a little over a year without any problems, there are a few tricks to make your foil and cutter block last longer.  They are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Do not press down hard when shaving (it actually cuts better when you let up on the shaver).&lt;br /&gt;2.  Use a pre-shave lotion.&lt;br /&gt;3. Do not use the \\&quot;Clean and Charge\\&quot; system after every shave.  The alcohol in the refills tends to shorten the life of your foil.&lt;br /&gt;4. Use the Clean and Charge system ONLY when it needs to be recharged.  Other times clean your shaver by using the brushes it came with.&lt;br /&gt;5. Reseal the clean and charge refill with the lid it came from after every time you use it.  It will last you FAR LONGER.  The alcohol dissipates when left open.  This will save you a lot of money too!&lt;br /&gt;6. If you must use a lubricant on your shaver, spray the foil and cutter foil with an aerosol spray cleaner like Remington Shaver Saver or some other lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow some very simple techniques (as mentioned above), you can save a lot of money on refills, foils and cutter blocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November 2008 UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I am STILL using the original foil and cutter block. I kid you NOT.  I purchase 2 extra sets but I have yet to use them.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing really special about the this.  I like my razor and I just needed a replacement head for it. I find it convenient to shop at Amazon for my needs, and I save a little money doing it.  Thanks m...</li>
    <li> It was easy to replace my old one with this and it&#x27;s been smooth since.  My shaves are easier and smoother since replacement.</li>
    <li> Braun shavers never seem to wear out, but after a couple years they don&#x27;t give that super-close comfortable shave they did when new. A set of these will restore them to factory-fresh condition.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve got a Braun 7000 series shaver, you&#x27;ve got to replace the screen and blade, and this is what you need. It&#x27;s best to change them at least once a year... look for the best price... When I found it on Amazon, it was the best price with free shipping and no tax... but check around on the web!</li>
    <li> I bought this product in Feb 2007 to extend the life of my two(2) year old Braun &#x27;syncro 7505&#x27; electric shaver and it did just that...The syncro is a powerful shaver and fitted with the new &#x27;cutter block n screen combo&#x27;, I still get a really good, close shave with no irritation to my sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve used this product for over one(1) month with no problems.</li>
    <li> Ijust received my new cutter head and it has renewed my razor back to its original state. highly recomend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this replacement cutting head for my 3.5 year-old Braun syncro and it was like buying a new razor.  The head is the new \\&quot;octagonal\\&quot; surface holes that was added to the newer design so, in essence, it can be viewed as an upgrade.  It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> These replacement blades/screens work just as advertised.  I replace mine about once per year as they dull about that often if one shaves 6 days per week on average.  I have noticed that the price on these replacements have slowly been rising over the last couple of years, unsure if that&#x27;s standard inflation or because they want customers to upgrade the razor instead of buying replacement blades/screens.  Overall though, it&#x27;s a quality product and this is simply the cost of maintenance.</li>
    <li> It was a good product for sure. My shaver worked perfectly, but I washed the blades with bleach and it was gone!! The metal was solves in bleach! Don&#x27;t do it!!</li>
    <li> This combo perfectly replaced old parts.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with the quality. Now my Brown works as new or even better :)!</li>
    <li> I am not sure it it us because this is a universal type blade but it does not seem to shave as smooth as my last blade I purchased at a retail store. I find myself making more passes to get a smooth shave than my old blade. I also noticed that the style of the blade was differnt. It seemed that the actual blades were thicker than my old blade. Possibly a deffective blade? Not sure.</li>
    <li> As close a shave as any electric shaver has ever given me. Lasts for well over 6 months.</li>
    <li> Great product as advertised.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a new razor again!</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to and improves performance on my razor after the old one gave me 18 months of good use.</li>
    <li> Did not feel well on my face. I just bought another razor.</li>
    <li> Replacement cutter seemed to be less sharp than the cutter it replaced.  Both were Braun replacement products, but the closeness of the shave was noticeably different.  Maybe it needs to be broken in for a few weeks, but right now, I&#x27;m disappointed in the closeness of my shave.</li>
    <li> These replacements made my razor brand new.  Close comfortable shave.  It&#x27;s simple to transform your razor into a new great feeling</li>
    <li> I have used my Braun shaver for many years, and this replacement combo, is as good as any I have  used.</li>
    <li> Ordered this replacement for my Braun shaver and I&#x27;m more than pleased with the results. Would buy this again when needed.</li>
    <li> I had not replaced my screen and cutting block in a couple of years. I noticed that my razor was tugging slightly on my beard and I was having to go back and forth over the same spot on my face and neck to get the whiskers to cut. I went to both Walmart and Target in search of a replacement and could not find anything that would fit. I found this one on Amazon a purchased it. Man what a difference! No more tugging and the whiskers are usually cut in one pass. I definitely recommend this for anyone with a 7000 series razor that needs a need screen and cutting block.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the close, quick shave I received after I replaced the blades.  I won&#x27;t wait as long from now on.  No irritation, faster shave, night and day results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and well worth the nominal cost.</li>
    <li> Since this is for an older razor, I have found it difficult to find the replacement blades locally. These worked out great!</li>
    <li> unpleasant shaving experiences come from dinted/ripped foils.&lt;br /&gt;thanks for the shipment and we will hopefully not need them too frequently as is usually the case.&lt;br /&gt;well engineered braun.  pat yourself on the back</li>
    <li> Glad to have the option to replace these parts.  Having new ones is like having a new shaver all together without buying a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised and was an exact replacement for my razor.  Was the best price I could find (Walmart no longer stocks) anywhere.  Shipped and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 8585 based upon reviews from here and the reviews from the \\&quot;correct\\&quot; cutter foils that you are led to get from the MFG; I have owned my shaver for just short of a decade and love it, but the foil and cutter replacement that I received last time seemed to be of a lesser quality; I read a review that suggested that this replacement set fit my shaver model and was less expensive. This version fits my shaver and Ive just had a really good shave....ahhhhhh.</li>
    <li> This item was a replacement for my father&#x27;s shaver.  It fit perfect and he is glad I could get it for him.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. Worked great and razor is good as new. Would recommend to anyone needing this replacement. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Works OK, but obviously not the same quality as the original.  Use it to replace original parts.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It fir and it shaves Perfect looking forward to dealing with again. I am not long winded that is al I have to say</li>
    <li> Do not buy from BUY A ELECTRONICS! This is not the quality replacement part, but the cheaper &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; version, which was not discovered (because the packaging is what the better quality replacement cutter block/foil have come in) until it was used. Skin gets ripped, lots of burn &amp; metal shavings discovered in the razor. The seller was contacted &amp; sent me vague, badly spelled/punctuated replies about what I was supposed to do. After nearly a week of seller foot dragging, BUY A ELECTRONICS gave me a $10.00 refund. This isn&#x27;t acceptable because the product is not as listed nor is the quality expected. I finally got Amazon involved &amp; they quickly got me a gift card to cover the rest of the miserable attempt this seller made to make this right. Amazon so rocks, BUY A ELECTRONICS needs to take a course in good customer service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m old and have used a lot of electric shavers. In all cases I have found that the electric shavers and their blades do an okay job of cutting facial hair. It&#x27;s not as close as a blade, but &amp;#34;close enough&amp;#34; so your face looks smooth. These Braun replacement blades/screen last about a year. Cleaning the shaver in the cleaning solution prolongs the screen and the blade&#x27;s life. The solution, however, is expensive. The newer electric shavers can be rinsed clean just using tap water, and they shave is just as close as the Braun. I have since moved on from the Braun because of the expense of cleaning solution (which is nothing more than rubbing alcohol and a tiny bit of mineral oil and a couple of drops of lemon extract). One star deducted because of the price of the cleaning solution.</li>
    <li> Seems like it&#x27;s not made to exact specs for the shaver</li>
    <li> This has happened twice; this blade will not fit  series 7000 razor, had to return this item in two different orders. Pleasechange item.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Braun electric razor for several years now and have been very happy. These replacements make a huge difference in performance.</li>
    <li> does the job but costs too much!</li>
    <li> Changing the tires on the car certainly doesn&#x27;t make a new car... but in the case of a new shaving head for this Braun shaver, it brings shaving back to the efficiency and speed that the shaver was when I first bought it 10 years ago.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for my dull blade. I&#x27;m back to getting a smooth close shave again.</li>
    <li> Needed to refurbish my old electric braun, which still works great. Ordered new kit with replacement head and blade. Very easy to snap on. Just like that, seemed like new razor again. Very fast on shipping also.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Replacement for worn out cutter</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based on the picture and the text in the product description. The picture shows the original foil and cutter. The shipped foil and cutter is the replacement that is not as good (30b) and by review doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long. The price with Braun was more than competitors but I paid the premium to get the better product. This is a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I was still using the original head &amp; blade for my Braun 7526. The head finally got a hole in it and it was time to replace it. When I received the new ones I could tell the design of the wire mesh was different. It felt much smoother against my skin than the original. The blade was dull so the new one made it a much cleaner cut. 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> It was okay but the grill started to develop holes after a short time of use. Not 100% happy. Now changed to norelco razor</li>
    <li> Glad I was able to find a replacement; this worked  as well as the original.  It saved me from having to buy a whole new shaver.</li>
    <li> The purchased Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro / Syncro Replacement Combo unit did exactly what it was suppose to do. As my model is older the local stores tend to carry only the current newer models. My razor unit works fine so I plan to keep it awhile longer. Amazon is a great place to find items that may not be available locally.</li>
    <li> This product works great without any issues. I would definitely recommend this to any of my friends. great overall product.</li>
    <li> not as sharp as original that worked for 8 years. This one is already dull.</li>
    <li> I have had the same Braun for many many years. It is amazing. The blades even last a very long time. I use them until the screen breaks. I can not use strait edges because it would destroy my skin.</li>
    <li> Wrong part for my shaver.  Ordered the wrong part.  Product applicability is misleading.  Doesn&#x27;t fit shaver  Requiring all these words is stupid</li>
    <li> It works fine when it is ask to replace the block every four months recommended. Okay price so I reccommend...</li>
    <li> item sent was for a braun series 3.  Never used it will have to purchase a new replacement to actually review this item</li>
    <li> As advertised, I don&#x27;t have any complaints.  This is a simple replacement part set.  Big box stores like target don&#x27;t carry them anymore.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my replacement</li>
    <li> This replacement kit keeps my razor going. Throughout the ownership (many, many years) of my Braun razor I have replaced the foil and blade multiple times, every time giving me much more life and effective shaves. So glad this kit is available!</li>
    <li> It was hard to find the replacement (there&#x27;s no easy correlation between the shaver model number and the replacement foil/cutting head), but when I did and replaced, the shaver works better than the original!  I get a closer shave with this shaver now than I do with a Gillette FusionPro manual shaver!</li>
    <li> The shaver I have is about 4 years old. It is the most expensive self clean available at the time. It is I thought the 7000 series but somehow the parts I ordered did not fit my Braun self clean system. I ruined my 200 dollar shaver when trying to fit the new items. I know and accept responsibility for this, but it was not easy to order the right parts the way Braun has the different shavers numbered! Since I opened the package and ruined my expensive shaver I must say my first experience with Amazon was an expensive situation. I now have a cheaper Remington, but the Braun was much better. Thank you.  Sincerely, Ed Foster.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with Braun electric shavers for 20 years or so. Loved most of them (especially an old, credit card sized one), but I particularly love my current 7000 series. Smooth, with no hair pulling and I never got any cuts, whether using it wet or dry. Buy one the first chance you get.</li>
    <li> The next time I get a shaver I am going to base my decision on how much the replacement blades cost because they last less than a year and this is the only choice I have for my shaver. Replacement blades for the Braun 7000 series shavers simply cost too much for what you get</li>
    <li> My old shaving head had broken.  This was the best price I found, so I ordered it.  I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived a day ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality replacement foil and cutter block, equivalent to the original hardware for my Braun 7505.  Highly recommended.</li>
