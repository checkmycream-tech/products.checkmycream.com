      <li>It stayed in my hair, absorbed into my hands, and just wouldn&#x27;t go away (despite how many times I obsessively washed my hands afterwards)!</li>
      <li>The smell is very sweet</li>
      <li>more like 3/4 full and the bottle did not have an aluminum protective seal on top of bottle cap to prevent tampering.</li>
      <li>I use the Greg juice which has a nice FRESH scent.  </li>

      <li>It works great, but the smell put me off, and my daughters hair is so dry afterwards.</li>
      <li>I am proud (and relieved) to say that it was worth every American dollar.</li>
      <li>and I see how it could be too much for some people, but I personally love it.</li>
      <li>Good for daily use after misting.</li>
      <li>I tried it twisting on wet hair and my hair has never been more moisturized!!</li>
      <li>Happy with this product look forward to trying other products from the line.</li>
      <li>I will use it up, because it&#x27;s no horrible in my hair, but I more than likely won&#x27;t repurchase.  </li>
      <li>This product detangles beautifully, however it&#x27;s incredibly heavy</li>
      <li>The next day, my hair dries pretty good</li>

      <li>smells great and not too heavy.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife uses this to moisturize her dreads.  She has gone through many, many products.  So far, so good on this one.  The only thing is it has an odd smell like wood burning.</li>
    <li> Product exceeded my expectations, and ithe shipped on time. Highly recommend this product for women with fine, thirsty hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product and support my fellow DMV resident. It works great, but the smell put me off, and my daughters hair is so dry afterwards. I mix it with coconut oil to cut down on the dryness.</li>
    <li> This has been an amazing addition to my curly hair maintenance. It&#x27;s light, but effective.</li>
    <li> I applied it to my hair the next day after I washed it. It smelled good and made my hair moist. The next time I applied it, I used just a little because too much of it will remove the curls and coils.</li>
    <li> I love how it feels (and smells) when first applied, but that feeling doesn&#x27;t really last. I do like it but I&#x27;m not in love with it.  My search for a moisturizer continues.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Provides perfect amount of moisture to my tightly coiled hair. Used along with the spray. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and this product added much needed moisture.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews, I took a big gamble out of desperation and purchased the liter size with the pump. I am proud (and relieved) to say that it was worth every American dollar. Not only does it smell like a heavenly bakery, it acts like a leave-in AND a moisturizer. In the past, I moisturized and sealed with oils and a leave-in and was not able to find the right &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; that didn&#x27;t weigh down my fine 4A hair; furthermore, it didn&#x27;t have the nerve to include demonic ingredients like mineral oil. I used this stuff for the first time about 5 days ago and right now as I&#x27;m feeling my kinks, it STILL feels like a soft marshmallow cloud on a summer&#x27;s day. Love must be the first ingredient instead of the last because it gives my hair the right balance of moisture. It&#x27;s very light, not oily, and is definitely not greasy (ew). So if you don&#x27;t have this product yet, go to the top right of your screen, add it to your cart, and receive your blessings. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Works perfect as a leave in conditioner. Not so much as a refresher simply because the consistency is literally like lotion it will mess up your hair if it isn&#x27;t wet. Aka the product didn&#x27;t absorb into my dry hair unless I just washed it.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, its a light weight sweet lotion, it moisturise nicely keeps the hair soft for a couple of days.... ummmmmm it has a thin consistency that spreads on easy, I rather heavy thick creams but in all it still works and works great in conjunction with the burnt sugar pomade.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I have crazy kinky hair and this really works.&lt;br /&gt;At first I did not care for the smell but the product works so great that I can get over the smell of baked goods! Lol</li>
    <li> This product detangles beautifully, however it&#x27;s incredibly heavy and I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the smell.  I used this product as a leave-in, under my &amp;#34;main ingredient.&amp;#34; The problem with using this as a leave-in, however, is that it is so heavy. Check the ingredient list - castor oil, olive oil, coconut oil, etc. Oils sit on your hair; they don&#x27;t moisturize. As a result, my hair felt super heavy, greasy, absorbed any and all smells in the environment, and needed to be washed twice as often. Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that!  Moving on to the smell, which was HORRENDOUS. I don&#x27;t want my hair to smell like sugary-syrup-cotton-candy, and unfortunately it was a smell that wouldn&#x27;t dissipate. It stayed in my hair, absorbed into my hands, and just wouldn&#x27;t go away (despite how many times I obsessively washed my hands afterwards)! As a result, I had to throw away the remainder of this product and purchase something lighter, which happened to be cheaper and just as good of a detangler.   Bottom line: If you prefer a light leave-in and/or are sensitive to smells, keep looking!</li>
    <li> This has been my staple hair product for years now. I have 3a/b curls that require lots of moisture but are prone to build-up with heavier, protein-based products. At the same time, the lighter, liquid based stuff doesn&#x27;t provide the level of hold that I want, and I generally don&#x27;t like gels. This stuff is awesome because it&#x27;s nice and creamy without loading down my curls. I apply it pretty liberally as a leave-in conditioner and hardly have to touch up my hair until my next wash. It&#x27;s basically the only product I apply now (apart from a shampoo that I&#x27;ll use every couple of washes)... Of course it still takes a while to wash my hair, but I do love having a simpler routine for once. It&#x27;s fantastic for detangling, and consistently leaves my hair soft, shiny, and extremely well-defined. Smells good, too. It&#x27;s one of the products that&#x27;s helped repair damage to my curls and transform them to a healthier state than ever. I really have nothing bad to say!</li>
    <li> Very &amp;#34;long-lasting&amp;#34; moisture with sweet &amp;#34;cake batter&amp;#34; smelling scent... I only gave 4 stars because; even though I like the smell, it&#x27;s a bit much..</li>
    <li> Love this product. My hair was so soft and manageable. I would repurchase. Not only that it got delivered very quickly.</li>
    <li> It is a truth universally acknowledged that every naturalista owes it to herself to try Oyin Handmade Hair Dew! ☺️. This versatile product delivers as promised and is suited for the entire family. The smell is absolutely heavenly making OHHD worth 6 Afro picks/stars! The exclusion of glycerine from its yummy ingredients makes it perfect for traveling overseas (to &amp;#34;farrin&amp;#34; ... Lol) as dew point/humidity need not be a consideration. OHHD also eliminates the need to travel with separate containers of leave-in, mosturizer and refresher. This is an arsenal in one bottle and she plays well with Eco Styler gels as well as Kinky Curly products.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!!!!! Totally moisturized my hair from the first application. Would definitely recommend trying it; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The ingriedient list says it all.  Your hair experiences moisture nirvana as soon as the products is applied and your curls, coils, and or kinks know that all is right with the world.  After you rinse it out, your hair feels soft and manageable.  I will be re-ordering very soon!</li>
    <li> Best product for my hair yet!</li>
    <li> If your hair likes castor oil and aloe Vera it will respond very well to this. It is very light so you can use it everyday and it won&#x27;t cause build up. I would advise that you seal it with an oil or butter</li>
    <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t quench my hair at all and smells awful. The scent is way too strong.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Buy now from Target</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair soft. Good for daily use after misting. Wish the price was better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had like three bottles of this stuff-staple for life!&lt;br /&gt;Consistency: light lotiony- penetrates my hair (I can tell because wen I use it on dry hair my curls start curling up)&lt;br /&gt;Smell: roasted marshmallow perfume or something-like wen u open a box of marshmallow fruity pebbles-not too light not too strong tolerable-slight linger&lt;br /&gt;Performance-excellent leave in/moisturizer-really makes my hair feel soft and moisturized and uncoated. Some products feel like they coat ur hair with softeness this one feels like it penetrates.</li>
    <li> I do have to say I was kind of scared to buy this because there was no reviews with any females  that had relaxed hair.  I was very scared it would weight down my hair.This stuff smells amazing and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  I actually have relaxed hair and it helps soften my new growth.  I usually use this to moisturize and seal my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy.  By the way, did I ever say it smells amazing?  It smells just like yellow cake.  My boyfriend loves it and snuggles closer(I think he likes me just for my hair). I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t have to moisturize as much and I believe this has a lot to do with it.  I will continue to buy this.  I use probably a nickle size so this stuff will last a long time.</li>
    <li> helps in softening hair</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at all but i like the fact that it smells like a kind of cookie</li>
    <li> Could not take the smell.  This conditioner smelled like maple syrup....eweee.</li>
    <li> smells great and not too heavy.  I use it every other day as instructed.  Hair loves it!</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness! This stuff is wonderful! I have a mix of 4A/3C hair, so my hair fries out pretty quick. This kept my hair moisturized all day. And the smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> Wonderful leave-in conditioner. I&#x27;m using it as the L in the LOC method and my hair just loves it. It gives my parched unruly tresses the moisture they need. Light texture but carries a punch; would definitely recommend it for dry coily hair. The smell is very sweet and I see how it could be too much for some people, but I personally love it.</li>
    <li> I had a sample of this for a while and finally decided to try it.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long, this stuff is wonderful.  I love the caramel sugary fragrance, it is sweet smelling (to me anyway).  In my hair the fragrance does linger for a few days.  It&#x27;s very light (great for fine/thin hair), but still very moisturizing.  I have ethnic hair, plus it&#x27;s fine now so it doesn&#x27;t like heavy products.  I&#x27;ve used this right after cleansing because my hair has a low porosity, it&#x27;s really hard to get moisture into my strands, this stuff really works great.  It leaves no residue or builds up on my hair, of course sometimes I also use this product after oil like in the LOC method.  It&#x27;s great as a leave-in.  I also (sometimes) use it daily in a week, but since I only have the 8 oz. bottle and a lot of hair to do that&#x27;s not cost effective for my family.  This does not have any type of hold, it&#x27;s main use is for moisture not as a styler.  This company does sell a product that&#x27;s supposed to work great with this (as a styler) but if haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  I will order again, however in the largest bottle they offer.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product to me. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days now but I absolutely love it. My hair is so much more soft and manageable. Will definitely purchase again!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it has such shining reviews on several different websites, but now that I&#x27;ve tried it I can&#x27;t understand what all the fuss is about. I have 3b/3c natural hair. I think it&#x27;s an ok product but I&#x27;ve found that when I use it in my dry hair it tends to leave it a bit stiff. I used it on my damp hair as well in addition to a leave in. I&#x27;m not terribly impressed. I expected more and it&#x27;s just a regular product. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Exacty what my hair needed for moisture. However, i thought the product would be thicker, it is more like a hair milk, but still more than satisfied. The smell is very yummy! Was pleased with delievery as well at the item!</li>
    <li> Adds a great amount of moisture to my 4c type hair.  In love with Oyin. This is a must in your arsenal and it smells great.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. It smells so good and it did make my hair soft at first. I returned it because my hair was so hard by the end of the day. It just didn&#x27;t work. I had a lot of shrinkage also. I think this one just wasn&#x27;t for me. We know all natural hair isn&#x27;t the same. I also ordered the whipped pudding and burnt pomade, maybe I&#x27;ll have better luck with those.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t thebomb.com for me...I&#x27;ve used better leave-ins.  I thought it would retain moisture better under a gel but had to add a little castor oil to it. I love the Oyin pomade!</li>
    <li> This product is like heavenly sent! It provides the perfect amount of moisture. It is so moisturizing that I have even used it to deep condition with. I love the way I can smell the delicious graham cracker/ cookie scent all day long. So refreshing- ahhhh! I feel delightfully spoiled when I use this moisturizer. It is now a must have product in my house hold.</li>
    <li> So after years of hearing raves about this product, I finally caught a decent sale and went for it.  I usually purchase products based on ingredients so I just  I have used it about 4 or 5 times now in mostly the same way, fresh out of the shower, hair soaking wet, apply the hair dew and seal w/a light oil or butter.  The next day, my hair dries pretty good but after a few hours, my hair feels soooo dry.  I thought maybe because of the extremely cold winter we have been having was the reason, but there is no glycerin in this product so I am confused.  My hair LOVES castor oil, which this also contains, but my hair is just not loving this product.  I will use it up, because it&#x27;s no horrible in my hair, but I more than likely won&#x27;t repurchase.  I always give away to a friend, donate or find a different use for products that don&#x27;t work for me, so it will get some use. :)</li>
    <li> Happy with this product look forward to trying other products from the line. Will use this product again and tell others</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy my Hair Dew from Amazon but did get it from Target. But if ordering online, it would be cheaper to get it from Amazon than from Oyin because of the $5 shipping costs that you&#x27;d have to pay for one 8oz bottle. I love, love, love this stuff and the curl definition it gives my 4b/4c, low porosity hair. I love the results whether I&#x27;m using it on damp hair or dry hair. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this dew, but for some reason, on my hair it&#x27;s a bit sticky feeling...&lt;br /&gt;I try mixing it with other hair products when I use it.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have a short natural afro that I wear curly (I use Cantu Shea Curling Activator-great stuff!).  I tried using the Handmade Hair Dew as a moisturizer alone but it didn&#x27;t really help.  I then took a water bottle and filled it up and added a tablespoon of the Hair Dew and olive oil and use it to help moisturize my hair (LOC method) before adding my curl defining cream. Very useful that way.  I have tried to use other conditioners this way but didn&#x27;t like the way it made my hair feel.  i would purchase again!</li>
    <li> My Type 4 hair is very dry. This is an awesome daily moisturizer. Absorbs super fast and the smell is to die for. On days when I&#x27; don&#x27;t refresh my curls with water, I use it morning and night. I just pat a little in onto my hair very gently. I have to admit that because I love the way it smells so much, I add it to the mix on wet hair days too.</li>
    <li> I like this product but the consistency is not thick enough for me. Works good and ingredients are awesome.</li>
    <li> Moisturizers with a great scent.  Simply does what it claims to do.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Oyin Hair Dew is a good product.  It moisturizes well and does what it says its going to do--not cause buildup.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel a bit greasy. Also couldn&#x27;t tolerate the smell. Smells very strongly like a cookie-scented candle. I found the sweet, fake smell to be cloying and too much for me.</li>
    <li> When I received product in mail I opened cap to take a look at the lotion and it didn&#x27;t appear to have 8 oz of lotion inside bottle....more like 3/4 full and the bottle did not have an aluminum protective seal on top of bottle cap to prevent tampering. The product smells wonderful but,  I have not used product on my hair yet. Probably will not order any of oyin&#x27; s products again unless I order from oyin&#x27; s website.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have Black, natural, very coarse hair.  I usually wear twisties.  This product adds life to my hair and keeps it from getting dry.  It is not heavy on my hair.  I use the Greg juice which has a nice FRESH scent.  I have found success with other Oyin products as well.</li>
    <li> So this does moisturize my hair really well,I only use it on my dry hair during the week and a little goes a long way, my hair feels slighty damp after use.  However the smell of it is so weird, i cant even describe it, its just weird. I would recommend it if you looking to try something new, but its nothing to special</li>
    <li> I boughy this on sale at Target because it smelled like cookies! I tried it twisting on wet hair and my hair has never been more moisturized!! Soft, not crunchy, moisturized goodness! And my curls stayed so pretty! I have 3c/ 4a hair.</li>
    <li> Always a great product!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair hard and dry. Didn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTLEY love this product. I find that it works better for me on dry hair as a daily moisturizer. I have really thick but fine strand  texlaxed 4a a hair.  For the ladies out there with fine strands; you know our main concern is heavy products. A little goes a long way and your hair will feel moisturized. I moisturize twice a week with this product. As stated before your hair will feel damp when you apply it since it&#x27;s water based but the castor oil along with the other oils seals the moisture in and leaves (at least my hair) feeling very soft for days.  I would order is from their website and not Amazon if I had to go the online route just to make sure that I&#x27;m getting an unused product OR get it from your local target. That&#x27;s where I purchase mine from.</li>
    <li> Many people rave about this but it did nothing for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> Its ok  nothing to jump up and down about this product gets rave reviews but I can&#x27;t give it that because it didn&#x27;t excite me</li>
