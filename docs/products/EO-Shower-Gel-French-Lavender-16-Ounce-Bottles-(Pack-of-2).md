      <li>I love that it&#x27;s made in California, not tested on animals, and uses 100% recycled plastic.</li>
      <li>My husband and I both love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I find that the hand soap has a stronger and more lingering smell than this.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This gel really cleanses, moisturizes and leaves you feeling fresh and smelling wonderful.</li>
      <li>Love EO products.</li>

      <li>and you feel nice and clean while smelling the relaxing lavender scent.</li>

      <li>I LOVE the strong smell of the hand soap each time</li>
      <li>I love this shower gel, the smell is so good, and the skin is not dry any more after use!</li>
      <li>I fell in love with the scent and how refreshing the clean in made me feel.</li>

      <li>(At home I have the EO rose shower gel right now</li>
      <li>I have numerous allergies to foods and chemicals, so this is a great product that is safe for me to use.</li>
      <li>I love this but am not convince that it is truely organic.</li>
      <li>I really love all EO products, which I first encountered at a ritzy Mendocino spa, but this one is probably my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Great scent - smells like real lavender and not very artificial.  </li>
      <li>bathers can enjoy this bit of summer as well.  </li>
      <li>It lathers well and leaves your skin feeling clean, not dry...and the scent is earthy...not perfume-y and overpowering.</li>
      <li>I WILL NOT REORDER TO MAKE THIS RIGHT!</li>
      <li>I recently tried the EO Frnech Lavender shower gel and loved it.  </li>
      <li>It does not work as a bubble bath, the bubbles dissipate too quickly, and the scent of lavender is quite muted in a tub full of water.  </li>
      <li>who is 3 for shampoo as it is so mild and</li>
      <li>Gentle, fabulous scent.</li>
      <li>Love the scent and the clear gel like soap.</li>
      <li>I definitely can say it is effective.</li>
      <li>But the ingredients in this product is definetily better for your skin since it doesn&#x27;t strip the natural oils of your skin.</li>
      <li>Love that its organic &amp; natural.</li>
      <li>Lovely scent, relaxing and leaves your skin so soft.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try</li>
      <li>/&gt;Their shower gel line is typical of all of their offerings--they smell great, the price is very reasonable, and they ship orders out with commendable speed.  </li>
      <li>but I keep returning to EO because the scents are so pure and clean and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>it is a really good product, but in future since I use it mainly for scent I will just purchase the lotion.</li>
      <li>I use it as a &#x27;bubble bath&#x27; and it is truly relaxing right before bed.</li>
      <li>Like to De-stress after a long day with a nice calming scent?</li>
      <li>This should be an amazing product for those with dry skin.  </li>
      <li>The cleansing foam is adequate and gentle.  </li>
      <li>It is also rich enough that I can use it to shave my legs (but I do have fine leg hair, so I can&#x27;t promise this would be the case for everyone).</li>
      <li>It seems to be very gentle but thoroughly cleansing on the skin.</li>
      <li>The essential oils seem to absorb into your skin, and what you end up with, after rinsing off, is a healthy radient glow.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love EO products. Use this in large bottle in all my bathrooms. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> The EO lavender scented products are my fave. They are the only I&#x27;ve found that smell just like the lavender growing in my garden and NOT like an old lady&#x27;s perfume. The shower gel is terrific! It lathers well and leaves your skin feeling clean, not dry...and the scent is earthy...not perfume-y and overpowering.</li>
    <li> This is a superior product.  The quality of ALL the EO products I have is outstanding. So, I knew the shower gel wouldn&#x27;t let me down! This gel has a wonderful lather and scent.  It cleans well without your skin drying out.  This shower gel was a great addition to the other EO products I have recently started to use.</li>
    <li> Quality product. Gentle, fabulous scent. Been using for over 6 months and still love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to knock this product but it&#x27;s not for me...I think I may be allergic. With that said, it has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality...great aroma!</li>
    <li> I first tried EO products while visiting BigSur in California. I fell in love with the scent and how refreshing the clean in made me feel. I have not only ordered in for myself but also for my daughter who also fell in love with it</li>
    <li> I have numerous allergies to foods and chemicals, so this is a great product that is safe for me to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I love the smell on my body after a bath or shower.  I use it on my great granddaughter  who is 3 for shampoo as it is so mild and her hair smells wonderful afterward.  As soon as my husband goes  back to work I intend to purchase this again and again.</li>
    <li> Smell good but only the pump was broken when it&#x27;s arrived</li>
    <li> GRAPEFRUIT AND MINT IS WHAT I GOT...WHAT A MESS IT WAS LEAKING ALL OVER THE PLASTIC BAG IT WAS SHIPPED IN TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED!  I WILL NOT REORDER TO MAKE THIS RIGHT!</li>
    <li> I love this shower gel!  It lathers nicely and has a wonder, yet subtle fragrance. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Like to De-stress after a long day with a nice calming scent? This is it.  Rarely do I play up a product so much, but I nurture my own Lavender plants, and if you have ever stood next to a Lavender bush in Summer in full bloom and breathed in, you would get the exact same scent as when you open a bottle of EO French Lavender Shower Gel.  It is TRULY AUTHENTIC.  When trying this gel, the first thing that blew me away was the scent, and then I tried it... I was not aware that the gel actually moisturizes skin.  I guess I should have read the bottle before I used it.  The essential oils seem to absorb into your skin, and what you end up with, after rinsing off, is a healthy radient glow.  This should be an amazing product for those with dry skin.  Washing with this gel (can&#x27;t say soap, it truly is NOT your bar soap) is like applying moisturizer in the shower.  The scent, strong in the bottle, dissipates while showering, but lingers just long enough to enjoy a relaxing aroma.  Sometimes, you can use a shower gel as a bubble bath, so I tried that as well.  It does not work as a bubble bath, the bubbles dissipate too quickly, and the scent of lavender is quite muted in a tub full of water.  I do understand, however, that EO makes the same scent in a bubble bath... so not to worry- bathers can enjoy this bit of summer as well.  This is one I will definately stock up on.  They did a good job with the Research and Development.  THIS is a spa day in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I use this shower gel almost daily at work after my morning work-out. The lavender scent is great - it is a fresh and welcome \\&quot;pick-me-up\\&quot; kind of scent for the morning, yet somehow also such a relaxing smell which is great for using before heading into the day&#x27;s work. (At home I have the EO rose shower gel right now but I prefer the lavender!) Overall I really enjoy this shower gel. It seems to be very gentle but thoroughly cleansing on the skin. It is also rich enough that I can use it to shave my legs (but I do have fine leg hair, so I can&#x27;t promise this would be the case for everyone). Definitely worth a try - I recommend it!</li>
    <li> EO Products are the only ones I buy!  Lovely scent, relaxing and leaves your skin so soft.  Not drying.&lt;br /&gt;The lotions and bubble bath are just as wonderful!  Highl recommend.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shower gel!  My shower is filled with EO products because of the quality and amount of essential oils in them.  This lavender shower gel is so infused with lavender that it&#x27;s truly aromatherapy!  I usually take lots of deep breaths to enjoy it a bit.  I&#x27;ve used lots of lavender products but have never found one, up to now, that is as true-to-life scented as the EO shower gel.  I have found my brand.</li>
    <li> I love EO French Lavender Shower Gel.  It&#x27;s made with pure Lavender essential oils so it doesn&#x27;t have the facory processed lavender smell.  It smells delicious if you love Lavender!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite bath gel. I love the lavender aroma, and the fact that it is organic. This is a product I do not want to run out of. Ever.</li>
    <li> I love this shower gel, the smell is so good, and the skin is not dry any more after use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying items from the EO line for years (they&#x27;re Bay Area based)--I found their website after a store where I&#x27;d been buying them disappeared one day and I needed to find a more reliable source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their shower gel line is typical of all of their offerings--they smell great, the price is very reasonable, and they ship orders out with commendable speed.  I&#x27;ve bought MUCH more expensive shower gels from time to time but I keep returning to EO because the scents are so pure and clean and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love this stuff. The smell is simply amazing, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any weird residue. Very lovely product!</li>
    <li> The scent is strong, but not in a bad way.  It&#x27;s great and long lasting.  Add this to your bath water and you&#x27;ll have wonderful bubbles.  Shower with it and you feel nice and clean while smelling the relaxing lavender scent.</li>
    <li> A great product, easy on the body,&lt;br /&gt;cleans and adds aroma&lt;br /&gt;fine lavender scent&lt;br /&gt;soft gel spreads easily&lt;br /&gt;light lather</li>
    <li> I find that the hand soap has a stronger and more lingering smell than this. I was disappointed with the shower gel simply because I have been using the hand soap for several months and expected to get the same smell. It isn&#x27;t a different smell...just not as strong...and by strong I do NOT mean harsh....I LOVE the strong smell of the hand soap each time I wash my hands. Just sayin&#x27;...</li>
    <li> I am only giving this 3 stars, as I believe it is actually making my skin itch.  As far as the smell goes, it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I have bought too many shower gels with fake lavender fragrances so I am totally pleased with this product which smells just like real lavender essential oil.</li>
    <li> I have the body lotion in this brand the fragrance is heavenly.  The shower gel has a MUCH fainter fragrance....disappointed.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone; the scent and consistently is wonderful, lathers nicely and rinses off without leaving a film on your body</li>
    <li> Very nice but the scent could be stronger.</li>
    <li> As the former Chief Pollinator at Burt&#x27;s Bees for 13 years, there are very few products on the market that I consider natural, healthy and effective enough to buy and use.  I adore all the EO Shower Gels, I have 5 different scents of EO gel in my shower!!!!!  They suds up perfectly, smell incredible and leave your skin super soft and clean.  And if that is not enough, the company has such integrity! EO uses organic essential oils for aroma, no parabans or man made preservatives, no GMO&#x27;s and is not animal tested.  Take it from an expert, EO shower gels are the BEST!!!!</li>
    <li> When I discovered that soaps, lotions, and shampoos could possibly cause cancers with something I know nothing about, \\&quot;Parabens\\&quot;, I started looking into Paraben-free products.  I will use these products forever.  the Shower Gel is a staple in our shower now.  Lavender is my fav because of the unbelievable scent.</li>
    <li> Because of my sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve tried many different gels and soap to no avail.  They all left my itchy and dry.  Finally, after many years, I found EO shower gel that not only didn&#x27;t leave me with any symptoms, but it was very nourshing as well.</li>
    <li> Great scent - smells like real lavender and not very artificial.  Not so sure about its moisturizing abilities, but it is good otherwise.</li>
    <li> Leaves me as moisturized as possible in the high desert. Smells wonderful. Feels great!</li>
    <li> I first purchased EO shower gel from a spa, and the fragrance lasted long after the shower.  This EO shower gel, while having the same fragrance lasted only while showering. The fragrance is not lasting. It&#x27;s as if the amount of fragrance has been diluted or minimized.</li>
    <li> I love EO Lavender lotion so I purchased the body wash.  It is the same scent as the lotion.  I prefer this lavender scent to other brands because it smells just as lavender essential oil smells (pleasant) - not the sweet smelling stuff you usually smell in stores.  It is very relaxing after a long day.  I took off stars because the scent does not last as long as other body washes I have used.  Overall it is a really good product, but in future since I use it mainly for scent I will just purchase the lotion.</li>
    <li> Very nice shower gel. It lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and great price</li>
    <li> I recently tried the EO Frnech Lavender shower gel and loved it.  The smell is not over powering, so you can use your perfume or sprays etc., but just enough to make your shower enjoyable.  If you have not used natural products without detergents, you may think the lather is not a lot.  But the ingredients in this product is definetily better for your skin since it doesn&#x27;t strip the natural oils of your skin. Specially great for sensitive skin and for babies and children.</li>
    <li> I really love all EO products, which I first encountered at a ritzy Mendocino spa, but this one is probably my favorite.  I use it as a &#x27;bubble bath&#x27; and it is truly relaxing right before bed. I find it really does help me get to sleep fast. The scent is clean and fresh and not sickeningly sweet or artificial as in some products - a result of using the pure essential oil and not some knock off distillate.</li>
    <li> All EO Lavender products are amazing because there&#x27;s nothing artificial or perfume-y about them.  EO &#x3D; Essential Oils and they make all the difference.</li>
    <li> the best shower gel I&#x27;ve used in a long time for sure.</li>
    <li> This is the best and the last body wash you will ever need or buy! It&#x27;s smells AMAZING! It feels AMAZING!  I look for reasons to take multiple showers everyday!  I am so impressed and VERY PLEASED with this product!</li>
    <li> Lavender is a great ingredient used in sachets, soaps and much more, to help relax. I definitely can say it is effective. It smells great and when paired with glycerin and Vitamin A (like in EO Shower Gel), it is truly a joy to use. This gel really cleanses, moisturizes and leaves you feeling fresh and smelling wonderful. I love it.</li>
    <li> Choosing this body wash was part of my &amp;#34;going green&amp;#34; product purchase. I love that it&#x27;s made in California, not tested on animals, and uses 100% recycled plastic. It also smells great!</li>
    <li> I picked this up from Whole Foods just to try. I love it, can&#x27;t go back to using anything else. Love the scent and the clear gel like soap. It does not dry my skin out. Would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very nice consistency and quality as well as scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan and love EO products. I just wish it was a bit more affordable!</li>
    <li> unlike what you get in most stores, it is thick instead of running like water.  I also think it leaves my hands softer than most soaps</li>
    <li> I expected more of a lavender scent.  The cleansing foam is adequate and gentle.  I do not plan to purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> This brand never disappoints, it does not disturb the natural skin pH and cleanses with a wonderful mild lavender aroma.  Comes in a 2 pack, perfect for each bathroom, one of the best quality gels on the market.</li>
    <li> Best natural, heavenly scent ever! So relaxing &amp; makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting a fancy Spa service. Cleans well &amp; leaves a slight lavender scent on your skin. Love that its organic &amp; natural.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent, it is addictive. Came on time and well packaged. Will be buying again, for sure!</li>
    <li> I love this but am not convince that it is truely organic.</li>
    <li> The fresh clean lavender scent of all EO products is the best I have ever found.  The soap is gentle and leave a good level of moisturizer an scent behind.</li>
    <li> This shower gel is lightly fragranced, and it does not dry out my skin. I have found very few products that are nondrying. Will continue to purchase EO products from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bath product junkie and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve found. The scent is wonderful; pronounced but not overpowering. It leaves your skin feeling great. But one of my favorite uses is as a bubble bath! It makes tons of bubbles that last a long time. Plus, it&#x27;s a great value. You can spend more, but you probably won&#x27;t get a better shower gel!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister.  She likes it.  It has a soft scent that is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Nowadays it&#x27;s difficult to find a body wash that dose contain glycerin, chemicals, dyes etc. For my family this gel fits the bill. Love the natural smell and it lathers wonderfully!</li>
    <li> All time favorite. .great price</li>
