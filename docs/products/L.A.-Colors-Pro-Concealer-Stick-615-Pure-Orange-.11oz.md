### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Good purchase , looking for more!!!</li>
      <li>I did find that it works best to rub the stick with your finger to warm up the product and then apply it with your finger to the skin</li>
      <li>The result is that my eye area looks good when I am done</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s important to know that it works best with a liquid concealer over it.</li>
      <li>This stick looks bright orange but applies lighter which I think is a good thing.</li>
      <li>idk it work good if u can blend good.</li>
      <li>Not bad, but it is not the best product for me.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Nice product .</li>
      <li>Love it work good on my face and under eye</li>
      <li>Worked great , reasonable price , quick shipping , awesome communications</li>
      <li>Cream ones kind of blend and leave the orange more noticeable.</li>
      <li>Love this product for directions</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a lip gloss than a concealer which makes it greasy and not matte.</li>
      <li>If I do find the magic combo, I will update but for now, I am going with 3 stars.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than the orange concealer I bought a while ago</li>
      <li>This works perfectly for me and brings more warmth into my face where I used to look a little gray-ish.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use though because it&#x27;s in a stick form.</li>
      <li>best for dark circles!!</li>
      <li>Enough coverage and does a good job of correcting</li>
      <li>Not the best product for me at least..</li>
      <li>Great for concealing dark spots and circles apply under foundation</li>
      <li>Its good for covering dark undertones</li>
      <li>Made me breakout - typically I have good skin, but this triggered a breakout.</li>
      <li>Shipped very fast .</li>
      <li>I will continue to use it and experiment to see if I can find a way that this stick and one of my many concealers will work and LAST.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping !</li>
      <li>but sometimes i feel ites still looks pretty orange after adding foundation over it...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK, doesn&#x27;t make things worse and I look fine right after applying.</li>
      <li>I do like the stick type concealers and was hoping to like this but not so much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kinda chalky and doesn&#x27;t really correctly much.</li>
      <li>I put too much on but it worked well.</li>
      <li>After that I am pretty much out of ideas and will just go on down the line to try and find another, more amenable corrector.</li>
      <li>much better than red lipstick if you are trying that red concealer trend.</li>
      <li>If your just looking to spot conceal dont buy this.im sticking to high end concealers .</li>
      <li>Works okay but not thick enough for coverage (especially for asian brown skin which really has dark color for blemishes) needs to be applied a lot over area for better results.</li>
      <li>This product is okay, but it was quite hard to blend into the under eye skin especially if you try to apply it straight from the stick.  </li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t seem to last for more than a few hours before I am back to being a zombie again.</li>
      <li>I have tried them all from yellow to red to blue to extra strength tattoo covering concealers and really nothing lasts so</li>
      <li>I saw a YouTube video about how amazing this orange concealer was and, because I have hereditary dark circles that have gotten worse with age, I HAD to try it.</li>

<li> this concealer does not last long at all</li>
<li> so I can&#x27;t say that this concealer helped in the long run.</li>
<li> I tried to apply it to the back of my hand hoping my body heat would help melt it down and make it easier to apply and blend</li>
<li> The lipstick dispenser is very convenient but the product itself is very thick and you need to blend it for a while for it to be movable.</li>
<li> BUT my circles creep back after a few hours as always.</li>
<li> Oranger than expected doesn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
<li> The product is not as expected and does not stay all day.</li>
<li> but not really if u do it right</li>
<li> I am a medium toned tan color and it did well to cover my dark undereye circles.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s alright but doesn&#x27;t proved 100% coverage of dark spots or sun damage.</li>
<li> I use it under my skin-toned concealer to truly get rid of any dark circles since it&#x27;s opposing purple on the color wheel.</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, didn&#x27;t hide my dark circles.</li>
<li> Works well for my dark areas on my face.</li>
<li> It crease and no easy to blend with other concealers.</li>
<li> it makes it a little bit easier to blend in.</li>
<li> A little oily, I have oily skin it doesn&#x27;t cover as well as I would have like.</li>
<li> I just saw a picture of myself and they were plain as day</li>
<li> I apply it and then apply foundation and my usual concealer over that.</li>
<li> Was really disappointed because the normal la girl concealers are everything!</li>
<li> The one I received was very hard and stiff and when I tried to apply it directly under my eye from the tube the pull on my skin was extremely bad and that is one thing I do not need</li>
<li> Its really greasey , hate it will never buy this again.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t say that this one is that much worse than the others.</li>
<li> The consistency was all wrong.</li>
<li> and when i did i was very disappointed with the product.</li>
<li> This is the worst .</li>

    <li> This works perfectly for me and brings more warmth into my face where I used to look a little gray-ish. It&#x27;s better than the orange concealer I bought a while ago and it goes on where i need it.</li>
    <li> This is the worst . Its really greasey , hate it will never buy this again. If your just looking to spot conceal dont buy this.im sticking to high end concealers .</li>
    <li> Made me breakout - typically I have good skin, but this triggered a breakout.</li>
    <li> this concealer does not last long at all it will be off by mid day</li>
    <li> Worked great , reasonable price , quick shipping , awesome communications</li>
    <li> Too orange and it is not creamy enough. It feels like a crayon. I wish it was different. Not bad, but it is not the best product for me. I have sand skin stone.. Not the best product for me at least..</li>
    <li> Works okay but not thick enough for coverage (especially for asian brown skin which really has dark color for blemishes) needs to be applied a lot over area for better results. It&#x27;s easy to use though because it&#x27;s in a stick form.</li>

    <li> Took weeks for me to get this and when i did i was very disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> I like this concealer. I use it under my skin-toned concealer to truly get rid of any dark circles since it&#x27;s opposing purple on the color wheel.</li>

    <li> much better than red lipstick if you are trying that red concealer trend. you can also mix it in with a concealer to make a peachy corrector</li>
    <li> Nice product . Enough coverage and does a good job of correcting</li>
    <li> Good purchase , looking for more!!!</li>
    <li> Works well for my dark areas on my face. I put too much on but it worked well. You must buff or blend this poduct in.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an orange corrector this is orange and not peachy or pinkish, but my problem with this is it&#x27;s blendability, meaning it has none. The one I received was very hard and stiff and when I tried to apply it directly under my eye from the tube the pull on my skin was extremely bad and that is one thing I do not need (I am 50) . I was hoping it would have the consistency of a lipstick but it does not. I do like the stick type concealers and was hoping to like this but not so much. I tried to apply it to the back of my hand hoping my body heat would help melt it down and make it easier to apply and blend but that didn&#x27;t work either. Next I am going to try and mix it with some creme illuminator to see how that works to blend it out. After that I am pretty much out of ideas and will just go on down the line to try and find another, more amenable corrector.</li>
    <li> Love it! I bought this because the nyx Orange concealer was sold out everywhere but now I found this ! Cheaper too . Shipped very fast . Great for concealing dark spots and circles apply under foundation</li>
    <li> Oranger than expected doesn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, didn&#x27;t hide my dark circles.</li>
    <li> This was not what I was expecting. The consistency was all wrong. It&#x27;s more like a lip gloss than a concealer which makes it greasy and not matte. I gave it 3 stars because it works but not how I would like.</li>
    <li> Its good for covering dark undertones but sometimes i feel ites still looks pretty orange after adding foundation over it... but not really if u do it right.. idk it work good if u can blend good. I like it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kinda chalky and doesn&#x27;t really correctly much. Was really disappointed because the normal la girl concealers are everything!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping ! Love this product for directions</li>
