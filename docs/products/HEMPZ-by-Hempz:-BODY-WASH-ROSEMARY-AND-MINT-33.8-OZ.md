    <li> I absolutely love this body wash!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is divine, a little goes a long way (wash cloth or puff), and it left my skin felling smooth and smelling wonderful. It&#x27;s the type of soap you use to relax rather your in a bath or shower It smells more like mint than rosemary and it left my entire bathroom smelling like mint(yum). I know its pricy but if your trying to get more for your money then amazon is the way to go! I mean honestly I would rather spend a little extra for a (1 liter bottle) verses going to a store like \\&quot;ULTA\\&quot; and only being able to buy a 9oz bottle at some outrageous price. I will definitely be buying this body wash again I hope they keep this in stock!</li>
    <li> hard to find size at a reasonable price, pump allows you to use just what you need, no waste, skin feels soft, mildly scented</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday. Prior to finding this I had a problem with dry and scaly skin after my shower. I no longer have this problem. I will continue to use this as well as other Hempz products. I have already purchased 4 bottles to be sure I have plenty in stock. I also plan to purchase Hempz products for gifts in the future.</li>
    <li> This is the best body wash on the market. You will love the results. The smell is not overpowering and does an excellent job not leaving you all dried out as some body washes can.  My wife and girls cannot get enough of it. I always stock an extra so no one freaks out.&lt;br /&gt;Our supplier &#x27;Zappina&#x27; always ships with care and speed.</li>
    <li> This product is great for your skin. Not drying at all. I no longer use soap when I shower. Just this product. Love all the hempz products. Their moisturizer is great too.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is very light and nonoily but does not dry out your skin. It lathers super well and you always feel clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Have been using this rosemary &amp; mint body wash for many years now and still love it!  Not only does the aroma wake me up, the wash seems to wake up my skin.  Am allergic to most soap, but have no trouble with this body wash.  Use several Hempz products and am happy with all I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Refreshing minty body wash!!</li>
    <li> Great to wake up to for those mornings when waking up seems so far away.</li>
    <li> HEMPZ body wash Rosemary and Mint is like a trip to the SPA!  The fragrance is relaxing&lt;br /&gt;and calming.  It is a great product--you won&#x27;t regret using this bodywash  for your own \\&quot;home spa\\&quot; experience.</li>
    <li> FRESH FRESH FRESH and you dont have to use a lot. one squirt covers my whole body. it will last you several months on one shower a day</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this body wash!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the condition it arrived in, which I will attach a picture.  It came with a pump, which is great, but it leaked and I had a mess all over the packaging.  I would suggest just a cap and include the pump separately in the box, if the seller wishes to include a pump.  The color/consistency look WAY off, but it smells exactly as it should so I am attributing it to being out in cold weather.</li>
    <li> Fabulous refreshing fragrance and feel.</li>
    <li> My problem is that I always want to have backups:)Ordered 2 already even I just started to use it.It&#x27;s just such a great product.With this I&#x27;ll order even 10 just to make sure I have it at home:). This body wash was my best choice and will definetly stay with it for long time..I feel so fresh, clean and soft after every use. Amazing stuff! Try it yourself,you&#x27;ll not regret it!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this and how clean I feel after bathing with it.  Received it pretty fast as well.</li>
    <li> I found it to be too drying to my skin. I assumed it would be as moisturizing as this brand&#x27;s wonderful lotion.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it is a thick lather that goes a long way :)</li>
    <li> The most amazing body wash ever! Invigorating! Complements on the smell! Smell words for everyone in the family!</li>
    <li> Great exactly as I wanted</li>
