### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Goody has always been our favorite barrettes!</li>
      <li>Kids love the bright colors</li>
      <li>The colors are nice and they&#x27;re sturdy, though.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t; they slip out very easily.</li>
      <li>I thought they were better...</li>
      <li>Love it coz it comes with diff colors and as discripted..</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t slide out easily.  </li>
      <li>but they are not bad though</li>
      <li>I got these hoping they&#x27;d hold fine, straight hair in place.</li>
      <li>Also, they have no grip and just slide right out.</li>
      <li>These are good at holding my very fine, thin hair.  </li>
      <li>I was worried these would not hold since they don&#x27;t have teeth, but so far they do a good job of holding back her hair and holding a lot of hair.</li>
      <li>Shipping is fast and on time too!</li>
      <li>but that is better than too loose.  </li>
      <li>I bought these barrettes because I have been using this kind since I was little, probably 20 years.  </li>
      <li>My daughter has very thick hair and these work great for keeping those strays out of her face.  </li>
      <li>these work great for thin hair.</li>
      <li>I ordered these barrettes because I thought the colors were fun for our 5 year old&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>so much so that they stick out and won&#x27;t hold hair in place.  </li>
      <li>I did not know they still made good old plain hair barrettes like this anymore!  </li>
      <li>These keep her hair back all day and they have fun colors.</li>
      <li>These are exactly what I remembered for little girls.  </li>
      <li>They have very nice colors and they are very tight, sometimes a little hard to open</li>
      <li>She has thick, wavy hair and the little plastic ones weren&#x27;t holding any more.</li>

<li> They are okay for very thin hair or child&#x27;s hair.</li>
<li> The picture makes it look like these are flat barrettes</li>
<li> A bit harder to open than they used to be</li>
<li> They are small enough for thin hair and the metal clasp keeps them secure.</li>
<li> They are a little difficult to un-clasp, but that may get easier the more I use them.  </li>
<li> My daughter had straight, thin hair and everything falls out of it.  </li>
<li> The colorful plastic housing goes over a metal clip, and the plastic makes it very difficult to open the metal clip.</li>
<li> They almost stayed too well in our granddaughter&#x27;s hair, but certainly held the wispy strands out of her eyes when all others had failed.</li>
<li> It was so frustrating trying to put them into a squirmy 5 year old&#x27;s hair.</li>
<li> The colors are not the same as shown in the picture, and it is difficult to open and close.</li>
<li> Disappointed that the barrettes are very difficult to open and close.</li>

    <li> Garbage! The picture makes it look like these are flat barrettes but they are curved...so much so that they stick out and won&#x27;t hold hair in place.  Also, they have no grip and just slide right out. They are made of one solid piece of plastic...no metal backing.</li>
    <li> They are okay for very thin hair or child&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> These are terrific.  My daughter had straight, thin hair and everything falls out of it.  These keep her hair back all day and they have fun colors.</li>
    <li> Kids love the bright colors</li>
    <li> Love it coz it comes with diff colors and as discripted.. Shipping is fast and on time too!</li>

    <li> Been looking for big girl barrettes for my 3-year-old. She has thick, wavy hair and the little plastic ones weren&#x27;t holding any more. I was worried these would not hold since they don&#x27;t have teeth, but so far they do a good job of holding back her hair and holding a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> They almost stayed too well in our granddaughter&#x27;s hair, but certainly held the wispy strands out of her eyes when all others had failed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Bob&#x27;s Burger outfit. The stayed on all night even though I want wearing a sweaty wig!</li>
    <li> They have very nice colors and they are very tight, sometimes a little hard to open but that is better than too loose.  They came on time and was as promised.</li>
    <li> these work great for thin hair.</li>
    <li> I got these hoping they&#x27;d hold fine, straight hair in place. They don&#x27;t; they slip out very easily. The colors are nice and they&#x27;re sturdy, though.</li>
    <li> The colors are not the same as shown in the picture, and it is difficult to open and close. Would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I thought they were better...but they are not bad though</li>
    <li> I bought these barrettes because I have been using this kind since I was little, probably 20 years.  These are good at holding my very fine, thin hair.  They don&#x27;t slide out easily.  They are a little difficult to un-clasp, but that may get easier the more I use them.  Overall, I know I can depend on these barrettes and could only find them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> A bit harder to open than they used to be - but they are what I wanted and so I like them.</li>
    <li> I ordered these barrettes because I thought the colors were fun for our 5 year old&#x27;s hair. Disappointed that the barrettes are very difficult to open and close. Would not buy these again. The colorful plastic housing goes over a metal clip, and the plastic makes it very difficult to open the metal clip. It was so frustrating trying to put them into a squirmy 5 year old&#x27;s hair. I gave up and they are going in the trash.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I remembered for little girls.  They are small enough for thin hair and the metal clasp keeps them secure.</li>
    <li> I did not know they still made good old plain hair barrettes like this anymore!  My daughter has very thick hair and these work great for keeping those strays out of her face.  Well made to!</li>
