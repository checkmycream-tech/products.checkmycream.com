      <li>These brushes came earlier than expected and turned out great.</li>
      <li>, you get what you pay for, and a little more i guess!</li>
      <li>but there are so many loose stringy fibers from the brush.</li>
      <li>$5 dollars for quality time with my little sister and amazing nails?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are super small which lets you get very detailed.</li>

      <li>Time to find a new set!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be trying out all sorts of new designs with these brushes!</li>
      <li>I love the pink tips of the brushes!!!</li>
      <li>I adjusted to using them gently and not as frequently.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited to check out Shany Cosmetics other nail stuff.</li>

      <li>I really shouldn&#x27;t be complaining, considering it was only $5</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t re-glued anything so far,</li>
      <li>so soft-</li>
      <li>I was hoping that these brushes would work (because the price is so cheap), but unfortunately, the metal came unglued from many of the wands shortly after I purchased them.</li>
      <li>They make me feel like a professional manicurist.</li>
      <li>The metal portion was not tight with half of brushs pulling off, nothing super glue couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to nail art, so these were a definitely must buy.</li>
      <li>I have been staring a pretty nail picture on Pinterest for too long - I finally got some tools</li>

      <li>They came in a large box with other items all packed with styrofoam peanuts, so they definitely weren&#x27;t damaged during shipping.&lt;br</li>

<li> Then, while cleaning them after the first use, one of the very small brush&#x27;s bristles pushed up into the metal neck.  </li>
<li> And Small Enough to do Delicate Designs on your Nails, you Don,t want Super Big Nail Brushes that cover your whole nail and are hard to use</li>
<li> when i got them, the brushes were slipping off of the wooden handle</li>
<li> This is disappointing, but superglue works just fine.</li>
<li> it does not work and ruins the bristles.  </li>
<li> You pay considerably less than a dollar per nail brush and man.</li>
<li> If you use black nail polish on the brushes you may fing that it will stain but, with a little nail polish remover it will come out.</li>
<li> Although I really like the ones that are whole, I was disappointed that some of them were broken on arrival.</li>
<li> These are just what I needed to do small detail on nails (nail art).  </li>
<li> This brushes are extremely small, but that&#x27;s not even the problem they were falling apart before i even started to use them and the ones that I did use</li>
<li> Just, as I said, pretty awful quality.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very disappointed the brushes are not nice. Any gel you use on these dries instantaneously and using acetone to clean it does not work and ruins the bristles.  Also one of the brushes had no brush it was not lost in shipping it just came with no brush on the end. Save your money or spend a little extra to get a better brush set from somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I thought these were good brushes when I gave them to my wife as a gift.  Then, while cleaning them after the first use, one of the very small brush&#x27;s bristles pushed up into the metal neck.  We were able to pull them back out, but now the bristles aren&#x27;t shaped right and are at varying lengths.  In order to use this brush again, I think we&#x27;ll have to trim the bristles with scissors to get them somewhat uniform again.</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails and these nail art brushes were perfect for me because they are the perfect size! the brushes are soft and nice to be able to do my nails and especially for its price, you can not go wrong !</li>
    <li> These are great for nail art. The color of these brushes are so cute, I love the pink tip. They are very small which is good for applying gel, glitter, etc to the nail.</li>
    <li> i love the fact that these brushes are so easy to use they don&#x27;t shed . you can be really precise with them. The orange color with pink tips are so cute. but are so affordable and they are pretty good.</li>
    <li> i love the combination of the pink on the brush to the gold wooden color on the holder, they are so cute and great for people starting out on doing nails highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I like these but there are so many loose stringy fibers from the brush. i risk many times having extra stringy lines when trying to design a nail art.  And they fall into the brush where i have to pull them back out.  kinda annoying.  I adjusted to using them gently and not as frequently.  They are okay for beginners.</li>
    <li> i think these brushes are nice. they are real good to do nail art and designs and are a perfect buy. Some of the brushes are also good for dotting and nail art. I like it a lot!!!</li>
    <li> I am crazy about nail art, Its so much fun and really inexpensive! These brushes are soooo cute and there are seven of them so you can do so many nail art looks :)</li>
    <li> My sister and I are big nail art fanatics and these are PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re so cute, when you get them it&#x27;ll make you want to do your nails all the time.&lt;br /&gt;This is such an awesome buy. You pay considerably less than a dollar per nail brush and man. $5 dollars for quality time with my little sister and amazing nails?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was SOLD!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for brushes that were easy to handle when doing detailed artwork. Bingo! The skinny ones are great for designs like chevron stripes, the thick flat ones make french tips easier and I love fan brushes for gradient nails!</li>
    <li> i had highish expectations for these brushes because they had okay reviews for the price, but a couple of things! :&lt;br /&gt;~right when i got them, the brushes were slipping off of the wooden handle i guess? i haven&#x27;t gotten around to gluing them on, but i pushed them on and they haven&#x27;t come off since!&lt;br /&gt;~the orange paint came off after an interaction with acetone a little&lt;br /&gt;~the thin brushes look thin, but don&#x27;t paint as thin as they look, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, you get what you pay for, and a little more i guess!</li>
    <li> Like others have said, the brush tips fall off as soon as you take them out of the package. This is disappointing, but superglue works just fine. They&#x27;re cheap brushes, so they&#x27;re made cheap. The brush tip themselves are nice, and clean easily. I bought them just so I could have some brushes to design my nails with, and they work for that. Just, as I said, pretty awful quality.</li>
    <li> It fell apart in a couple of days. Just didnt last long like I had hoped it would. I wouldnt&lt;br /&gt;waste your money.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that these brushes would work (because the price is so cheap), but unfortunately, the metal came unglued from many of the wands shortly after I purchased them. I suppose if you have super glue and want to bother re-gluing the metal it&#x27;s not such a big deal, but steer clear if that&#x27;s something you&#x27;d rather not have to do. The bristles themselves are fine - I had no issue with the quality in that regard... but I haven&#x27;t re-glued anything so far, so they&#x27;re sitting around, unused.</li>
    <li> I was looking for brushes for gel application.  These brushes are not for Gel or Acrylic applications- artwork on nails, yes!  But still very very SMALL!!  I haven&#x27;t used them, probably will return since I don&#x27;t so nail art.  Although, $5 for a set of brushes isn&#x27;t bad- still deciding.  I will update on return process.</li>
    <li> Although I really like the ones that are whole, I was disappointed that some of them were broken on arrival.</li>
    <li> I love this set! The handles are nicely weighted and I thought the price was very fair for such nice brushes.</li>
    <li> This brushes are extremely small, but that&#x27;s not even the problem they were falling apart before i even started to use them and the ones that I did use i was only able to get one use out of, save your money and go get a set of acrylic painter brushes from walmart they work much better,</li>
    <li> These brushes came earlier than expected and turned out great. However, when i took them out of their package some of the tops fell of the plastic/wood  handles. I will glue them back on. When i used one of the small brushes the line came out smooth and straight. If you use black nail polish on the brushes you may fing that it will stain but, with a little nail polish remover it will come out. I have done rainbows and all of my friends have complemented me on how expertly they were done.</li>
    <li> These nail brushes are fantastic to do nail art, easy to clean and multiple sizes brush to create many different nail art design.</li>
    <li> I have been staring a pretty nail picture on Pinterest for too long - I finally got some tools so I could do it myself! These brushes let me recreate any nail art I&#x27;ve ever seen. They are super small which lets you get very detailed. Perfect for those that are into the nail art trend!</li>
    <li> These nail art brush is perfect! Every size brush you need is in here! All of these nail brushes is wroth the price! I recommend it! :)</li>
    <li> I really shouldn&#x27;t be complaining, considering it was only $5 but when I got it in packaging, some of the brushes fell out of the handles so I had to superglue the brushes back on the gold handles. HOWEVER, I&#x27;m not too picky of a person so I didn&#x27;t care. I glued and fixed it, and I love it! Such a great add-on.</li>
    <li> The brushes look good but upon opening the envelope, I found that one of the brushes was bent. Giving it three stars, may re-rate after usage.</li>
    <li> Words can&#x27;t describe how ecstatic I was when I saw the price of these nail brushes! I&#x27;m new to nail art, so these were a definitely must buy. I love how creatively they are arranged in the picture! The brushes delivered precise lines, it looked like I had gotten a manicure in a salon! I liked the variety in the shapes of the brushes, I only wish that the set came with a dotting tool. I&#x27;ll be trying out all sorts of new designs with these brushes! They make me feel like a professional manicurist.</li>
    <li> This is such a unique set! In all my years of looking for the next best thing in beauty. I have never seen anything like this! I love orange and pink! This set is great to experiment with, I love my new buy!</li>
    <li> I love the pink tips of the brushes!!! Exceptional quality- no shedding nd so soft- a complete set for a precise look</li>
    <li> I received the package in a timely manner but all the tops fell off the brushes. I had to glue them on with super glue. They worked great after that. I recommend ordering glue with this purchase. Three stars for the price. If they had not all been broken when they arrived it would have been five.</li>
    <li> This item is made poorly, the brushes fell apart as soon as we took out of the package. Time to find a new set!</li>
    <li> Great set of nail art brushes for the price. The metal portion was not tight with half of brushs pulling off, nothing super glue couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t reach my house yet, but i&#x27;m hoping it will turn out well. I will write another review when it reaches my house. I put five stars because i think it will turn out well.</li>
    <li> These Nail Art Brushes Are Cute And Small Enough to do Delicate Designs on your Nails, you Don,t want Super Big Nail Brushes that cover your whole nail and are hard to use</li>
    <li> I used the hooked brush once to give my mom french nails and it worked okay. It was great! I guess it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
    <li> For the price they are okay but the brush heads keep falling off and they are not as useful as a tool as I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. I opened the packet and every last one of the paintbrush heads were detached from the handles. They came in a large box with other items all packed with styrofoam peanuts, so they definitely weren&#x27;t damaged during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;It is just a cheap, poorly made product.</li>
    <li> These are just what I needed to do small detail on nails (nail art).  The various sizes are great.  Make sure you wash the brushes at the end of each use or they will be ruined.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just starting to get into playing with nail art and didn&#x27;t want to invest too much upfront until I knew what I was doing. I am SOOOO glad I got these brushes. They are so small and amazing for detail work. I&#x27;m so excited to check out Shany Cosmetics other nail stuff. I&#x27;m officially hooked!</li>
    <li> The brushes looks really pretty and durable. It&#x27;s only $5 !! I would definitely purchase this and try it out.</li>
