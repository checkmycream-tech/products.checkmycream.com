### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and it was working great!</li>
      <li>This is truly an excellent product.</li>
      <li>Great purchase for the price</li>
      <li>Really good</li>
      <li>and I had a cortex before that I loved.</li>
      <li>Since this had lots of good reviews and the MRSP was $220 (the zebra one)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s correct ,It does  a good job, but it not make my hair as shiny as do</li>
      <li>Works perfect and is completely worth it!</li>
      <li>Love it works great</li>
      <li>I bought my 450F iron at TJ Maxx and I am very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>, my hair looks awesome and with right products no damage at all</li>
      <li>The customer service with the seller of this product was phenomenal as well!</li>
      <li>I like it somewhat diffcult to get use to at first but great item!!</li>
      <li>I love this straightener and just hope that they make them as well as they used to!</li>
      <li>Great quality, very fast shipment, beautiful product and very useful</li>
      <li>More than satisfied!</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to purchase this one.</li>
      <li>Love the glittery zebra print  </li>
      <li>I love this straightener.</li>
      <li>Plus, who doesn&#x27;t love zebra print?</li>
      <li>Love it... for a straightener not as a curler.</li>
      <li>The zebra print is cute...</li>
      <li>and they get real hot!</li>
      <li>she loved it and it works really well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve travelled all over the country with it, it is easy to pack.</li>
      <li>With almost daily use it is holding up great.</li>
      <li>but that is because it is made out of a cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>I used a baking soda paste to clean it, and it was fine, but I bought this &amp;#34;brand new&amp;#34; it shouldn&#x27;t have looked that way.</li>
      <li>(and my hair is already straight!!!</li>
      <li>so I was really excited to use it</li>
      <li>I absolutely love, love, love these flat irons.</li>
      <li>but if you need a salon finish on your not so healthy hair the infrashine or another professional brand would be a better choice.</li>
      <li>but my hair is still in the process of getting healthy, so maybe if your hair is super healthy and has a natural shine this could work for you</li>
      <li>Make sure you are getting the real thing and not a defected product.  </li>
      <li>wish it was pink glitter :-)!!</li>
      <li>After a  thousand times dropping it it now wants to break!!</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s pretty!</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>This one has tourmaline finishing, and I don&#x27;t know if it is much better than my old one.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing and inexpensive flat iron.  </li>
      <li>This Cortex Platinum Flat iron is amazing.</li>
      <li>Another important thing is that I recently had something done to my hair and the &amp;#34;salon experts&amp;#34; over processed it which resulted on me needing to get a hair cut on my long pretty hair and lots of moisturizing restoring treatments which have worked great</li>
      <li>One thing I know about tourmaline flat irons is that they brake very easily.</li>
      <li>flat iron is very pretty, much more than the picture</li>
      <li>and I realize that it has been updated from my first model.</li>
      <li>so I was looking for another cheap but professional option.  </li>
      <li>Will most definitely recommend.</li>
      <li>Keeps hair soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I just love the cortex flat iron.</li>
      <li>Cortex tools are great in general but this specific model is a left over from manufacturing error!!!</li>
      <li>The real Cortex Solo 450 is made of 100% Titanium and reaches 450F (230C).  </li>
      <li>Up until the last day, the heat was even and it kept my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>I really like it, and it is still working.</li>
      <li>so the shipping wasn&#x27;t handled very well.</li>
      <li>The flat iron is light</li>
      <li>After a few months, however, the straightener would leave my hair with a burnt smell, pretty strong too, so I stopped using it.</li>
      <li>I probably need a new one...</li>
      <li>I bought this new one for my sister.</li>
      <li>Sometimes is hot, and in the middle of my work it gets lukewarm.</li>
      <li>So I tried it again the next day and used more of my thermal spray (which I had used the day before and normally use when I flat iron) and the same thing happened.  </li>
      <li>, I used it to flat iron my hair as usual and first it took much more temperature to get my hair as I like it</li>
      <li>This was a gift for my 12 year old.  </li>
      <li>mind you my hair is all natural.</li>
      <li>These irons work well on relaxed and natural hair</li>
      <li>my old corioliss</li>
      <li>My old cortex was VERY tough and that is one of the main reasons I liked it.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected since this is the exact same flat iron my stylist uses on me.</li>
      <li>I have medium amount of hair and it is thin, I own an infrashine flat iron and usually iron my hair on the 350 temperature setting which is the one that works for me, when I use it to straighten my hair my hair gets a salon finish very shiny look</li>
      <li>I have a black 1 inch and really wanted a zebra print</li>

<li> I loved the product...and was disappointed when it suddenly stopped working.</li>
<li> it took a lot of time to get all my hair flat ironed and when I finished it did not look shiny at all</li>
<li> She thought it was the coolest flat iron ever.</li>
<li> I flat iron because it gets freezy)</li>
<li> To be honest I was disappointed with this flat iron because it looked like it had been used before.</li>
<li> I bought my in 2009 and after few drops over the years, only now for apparently no reason it starts losing power.</li>
<li> it was freezy and had a lot of electricity, not a normal thing in my hair.  </li>
<li> I got this guy a few months back</li>
<li> This flat iron works really well on my thick hard to manage hair.</li>
<li> Straightened my hair faster than my other straightener, although it took away some volume, which I was dissapointed with, but it was liveable.  </li>
<li> I have absolutely no complaints about this product or the seller!</li>
<li> , I thought maybe it was because of the shampoo I used that day or some other reason.  </li>
<li> That is an unbelievable amount of time for a hair straightener that I used almost every single day.</li>
<li> The receipt I got was cut in half and didn&#x27;t have a return sticker...</li>
<li> If you have thin hair use a thermal spray on your hair when flat ironing</li>
<li> I have very thick long hair</li>
<li> I contacted amazon and as usual they had no problem making a refund on this item and asked me to keep it to donate or to do whatever I wanted with</li>
<li> usual</li>
<li> I ordered this flat iron because I&#x27;m obsessed with zebra print</li>
<li> And I am obsessed with my hair, so I used it for a LONG time each time I used it.</li>
<li> I had this straightener for at least 5 years, and today it JUST died.</li>
<li> the refund and returns department on Amazon gets 10 stars, but this flat iron does not work for my hair or maybe I had bad luck</li>
<li> 2 hours later my hair was awful!!!</li>

    <li> Cortex tools are great in general but this specific model is a left over from manufacturing error!!! The real Cortex Solo 450 is made of 100% Titanium and reaches 450F (230C).  Make sure you are getting the real thing and not a defected product.  Itay</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I have very thick long hair and I swear by it. Only reason im on here is because after 6 years of having it, I just dropped it and cracked the ceramic plate. After a  thousand times dropping it it now wants to break!! I love this straightener and just hope that they make them as well as they used to!</li>
    <li> About 4 years ago I bought this product. I really like it, and it is still working. I bought this new one for my sister. Same model, and I realize that it has been updated from my first model. I bought my 450F iron at TJ Maxx and I am very pleased with it. This one has tourmaline finishing, and I don&#x27;t know if it is much better than my old one. One thing I know about tourmaline flat irons is that they brake very easily. So I will let you know if my sister has any complains. Update: I bought this model for my sister in 2013 and she has no complains. I bought my in 2009 and after few drops over the years, only now for apparently no reason it starts losing power. Sometimes is hot, and in the middle of my work it gets lukewarm. I probably need a new one...</li>
    <li> I loved the product...and was disappointed when it suddenly stopped working. I presume it was an electrical fluke as my mother has the same one and has not had any problems with it. I would still definitely recommend this product to others. The customer service with the seller of this product was phenomenal as well!</li>
    <li> I have medium amount of hair and it is thin, I own an infrashine flat iron and usually iron my hair on the 350 temperature setting which is the one that works for me, when I use it to straighten my hair my hair gets a salon finish very shiny look but it is starting to work unpropperly so I was looking for another cheap but professional option.

    <li> I absolutely love, love, love these flat irons. They leave the hair silky and shiny...mind you my hair is all natural. These irons work well on relaxed and natural hair I would definitely recommend them.</li>

    <li> Love it... for a straightener not as a curler. Keeps hair soft and smooth. Will most definitely recommend. :) ***</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s correct ,It does  a good job, but it not make my hair as shiny as do my old corioliss</li>
    <li> Great quality, very fast shipment, beautiful product and very useful, my hair looks awesome and with right products no damage at all</li>
    <li> Really good and they get real hot! Great purchase for the price and I would definitely recommend them to someone!</li>
    <li> More than satisfied! Works perfect and is completely worth it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron because I&#x27;m obsessed with zebra print and I had a cortex before that I loved. To be honest I was disappointed with this flat iron because it looked like it had been used before. The ceramic plates were covered in a gross residue. I used a baking soda paste to clean it, and it was fine, but I bought this &amp;#34;brand new&amp;#34; it shouldn&#x27;t have looked that way. The flat iron is light but that is because it is made out of a cheap plastic. My old cortex was VERY tough and that is one of the main reasons I liked it. I tend to drop things regularly, and I don&#x27;t know how well this flat iron will hold up. Overall the flat iron works well. The receipt I got was cut in half and didn&#x27;t have a return sticker... so the shipping wasn&#x27;t handled very well. But it came, and it works. The zebra print is cute... so 3 stars I guess.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works really well on my thick hard to manage hair. Plus, who doesn&#x27;t love zebra print? I know I do!</li>
    <li> I had this straightener for at least 5 years, and today it JUST died. That is an unbelievable amount of time for a hair straightener that I used almost every single day. And I am obsessed with my hair, so I used it for a LONG time each time I used it. Up until the last day, the heat was even and it kept my hair smooth and shiny. It never once snagged my hair. I&#x27;ve travelled all over the country with it, it is easy to pack. This is truly an excellent product.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing and inexpensive flat iron.  I have had this for over a year now and it still keeps heat and straightens my hair well.  I have absolutely no complaints about this product or the seller!</li>
    <li> I just love the cortex flat iron. I have a black 1 inch and really wanted a zebra print ( can&#x27;t wait for it to arrive) leaves my hair shinny and silky.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t fry my hair. If you have thin hair use a thermal spray on your hair when flat ironing</li>
    <li> This Cortex Platinum Flat iron is amazing. And it&#x27;s pretty! I&#x27;m glad I decided to purchase this one. Must buy!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my 12 year old.  She thought it was the coolest flat iron ever. With almost daily use it is holding up great.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected since this is the exact same flat iron my stylist uses on me. Just havent gotten the hang of how to create big bouncy curls with these yet.</li>
    <li> I like it somewhat diffcult to get use to at first but great item!! Love the glittery zebra print  wish it was pink glitter :-)!!</li>
    <li> Present for granddaughter she loved it and it works really well. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love it works great this is my second on</li>
