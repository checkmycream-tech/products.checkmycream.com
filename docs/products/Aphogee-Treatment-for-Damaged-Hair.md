      <li>We tried the aphogee 2 step treatment and her hair was repaired to the point that she loved it.  </li>
      <li>I heard it&#x27;s good stuff though.</li>
      <li>I bought this because of good reviews I had read somewhere else.</li>

      <li>I am a licensed cosmetologist and never ever experienced this kind of dilhemma before with a client or myself.</li>
      <li>I had a $250 keratin/Brazilian blowout treatment,  which I LOVED.  </li>
      <li>APHOGEE IS A GOOD PRODUCT</li>
      <li>I know a lot of you out there have some not so good things to say about Aphogee Two-Step Protein</li>
      <li>and my hair came out so gorgeous.</li>
      <li>My beautiful healthy hair was destroyed.</li>
      <li>Good luck all and make sure you know that you need it before you try it!</li>
      <li>Then I tried Aphogee 2 step protein treatment, and instead of helping, I experienced even more breakage once I was through with it</li>
      <li>My hair is usually very healthy, but after all of the processing, I got to this point.</li>
      <li>Great product for hair treatment and healthy care.</li>
      <li>My hair was very healthy.</li>
      <li>I must say I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Follow the directions as stated on the bottle for the two step treatment and you&#x27;ll be very pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I so wish I had tried this product a year ago, so I might have retained more length!</li>
      <li>OMG i had to check the ingredients to see if it was made from unicorn milk and dragon secretions because this stuff is MAGICAL!</li>
      <li>youll absolutley see and feel better hair..!</li>
      <li>I love the results!</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>used it 3 times already - once a week and results are amazing.</li>
      <li>and it worked AMAZING.</li>
      <li>It is amazing when used for what it is intended for.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>I aimed the blow dryer at it and it got amazingly plasticky feeling.</li>
      <li>Its just so amazing.</li>
      <li>the protein treatment has a putrid odor (sort of like the smell of vomit--sorry just being honest).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit it felt nice</li>
      <li>Even my hair stylists was like, what are you doing to your hair, it&#x27;s healthy, gorgeous and longer than ever.</li>
      <li>And you have to know how to assess your own &#x27;hair health&#x27; to know if your issue even warrants the treatment.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Buy this product and do your own protein treatments at home if you are experiencing shedding and damage.</li>
      <li>but this honestly didn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
      <li>have 4C-Z hair, use a lot if Aubrey Organics products and mix my own as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it is a good product, but  like I said before its not for everyone.</li>
      <li>and I was worried that the product was doing more harm than good.</li>
      <li>I thought ok this seems good.</li>
      <li>I read so many good reviews about Aphogee 2 step</li>
      <li>I just smiled.</li>
      <li>It turned out wonderful, I highly recommend this.  </li>
      <li>After 1st application of Aphogee it was incredible - much softer and manageable!</li>
      <li>It will rinse out very easily, you don&#x27;t need to shampoo it out, and then you can do the moisturizing treatment.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I was terrified of doing more harm.</li>
      <li>So I just stood under warm water in my shower for about 3 minutes without touching my hair.</li>
      <li>This is by far one of the BEST treatments I have ever given my hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair that is thinning as I age.  </li>
      <li>Love it, love it, love it!</li>
      <li>It is very important to follow the directions with this product.  </li>
      <li>This, also, is VERY IMPORTANT.</li>
      <li>All the aphogee products are amazing my hair is healthy strong and silky I would recommend</li>
      <li>She said it helped to imagine Dolly Parton doing your hair in the shop from Steel Magnolias, which I found hilariously accurate!</li>
      <li>They do make a product that comes in a square plastic package that works much better than this.</li>
      <li>To Get More Damaged .</li>
      <li>Because it will make the hair dryer, even more brittle and more prone to breakage.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;d</li>
      <li>love this product, is my go to treatment.</li>
      <li>I would have been better off just letting my hair shed.</li>
      <li>Shinyy and healthy looking.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I started using this back in the 90s as a kid. It was recommended by a stylist who would do the treatments for me until I started doing them myself at home. If you&#x27;re trying to retain length lost due to breakage this may be a huge help for you. Back in the olden days this stuff smelled HORRIBLE and contained \\&quot;animal byproduct\\&quot; of unknown nature. (eggs,maybe?) These days it still doesn&#x27;t smell good, doesn&#x27;t contain animal byproduct, but the odor is no where near as bad as it once was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my hair isn&#x27;t as hard or frizzy after I do a treatment anymore. Back in the olden days it was guaranteed that my 3b curls would tighten up to nearly 3c after a protein treatment. Both the shampoo and balancing moisturizer are much better than they once were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent breakage as well as it once did. While there could be other dietary factors and such contributing to this for me, it doesn&#x27;t seem to take me all the way to zero breakage... at say the crown of my head where my hair is more fragile. This new formula does help, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good as the old one. However, it could also have something to do with changes in regularity. If I haven&#x27;t really been experiencing breakage I might only use this every 2 months. If I&#x27;ve notice breakage I&#x27;ll use every 6 weeks as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair and can&#x27;t comfortably sit under the dryer anymore with this treatment. I use a hand blow dryer applying the treatment in sections and drying in sections. When straight my hair was waist length when I bought the bottle I just finished, but currently about 3 inches shorter. I get about 2.5 uses out of bottle! I have thick, porous hair. I&#x27;m sure people with super thick hair will use even more product. When my hair was short/medium length and dyed, was able to get about 5 uses out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These days I also use the Aphogee shampoo along with the treatment instead of my regular shampoos. I actuallylike the combination. While I do let the Aphogee balancing moisturize set in my hair for longer than 3-5 minutes, it&#x27;s not what I use to deep condition. After letting it sit for about 15-20 minute, I rinse and use a *real* deep conditioner. Anything from Biolage, SheaMoisture, original Cholesterol, or any other heavy conditioner I have on hand. And when I&#x27;m all done my hair is just as soft as it would be otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while I&#x27;m liking that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel hard these days, I do sort of wish it had the anti-breakage power it had way back when.</li>
    <li> Well I don&#x27;t know what went wrong, but this did not seem to work. Instead my hair broke off in smaller ringlets. I followed directions to the \\&quot;T\\&quot;, and tried to rinse as thoroughly as possible, but an hour of rinsing it out in the shower was still not enough - because my hair was DRY DRY DRY... I knew this would happen based on other reviews so I armed myself by applying the Aphogee balancing moisturizing conditoner along with Shea Moisture leave in and Avocado butter, but the dryness was a little too powerful.  I am literally afraid to use this stuff again... oh, and why didn&#x27;t anyone warn me about the rank smell... All I could think was, \\&quot;This $#&amp;@ stinks to high heaven!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well. the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I would never have found out about Aphogee Balancing Moisturizing conditioner had I not went in search for the protien treatment.</li>
    <li> I am an African American female with very coarse, dry, relaxed hair that was severely damaged from using chemicals and heat appliances.  I also work out and sweat in my hair. I have used the two step protein treatment twice now (4 weeks apart), following the directions exactly. In between the treatments I followed the recommended regiment for damaged hair, using the Shampoo for Damaged Hair, the two minute reconstructor and the green tea reconsturizer.  Because their moisturizer is too light for my hair type, I use it only for 5 min as instructed and then do a deep conditioner (20 min. under a hooded dryer) using my Carol&#x27;s Daughter product.  After only 6 weeks my hair is doing great.  My hair has always looked dry and would shed and break easily. Shedding is minimal and it looks and feels soft and shiny. What a difference.  I would highly recommend this treatment if your hair is relaxed and damaged.  Follow the directions as stated on the bottle for the two step treatment and you&#x27;ll be very pleased with the results.  To prevent the dryness protein treatments can cause, I deep condition with my Carol&#x27;s Daughter product after each shampoo.  I also do a hot oil treatment with olive oil and jojoba oil before I shampoo.  Leaving it on for 20 minutes under a hooded dryer. I&#x27;ve cut back on the heat to once a week right after I shampoo.  Once I set the curls if I need to touch them up, I use rollers or pin curls.  A few weeks ago this would have been impossible to do. Great product.</li>
    <li> My professional and personal opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product is better for nonprocessed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with  C. Waters \\&quot;darth tater tot revelations in the Mizani protein product review, protein treatments only work if properly moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was relaxed and at a separate time highlighted blonde last year. This product makes the hair hard while treating it but I wasn&#x27;t prepared for what happened a few months later..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair broke off so severely (by two thirds) that I had to have my stylist give me a short pixie haircut to salvage what was left. I bought a wig and wore for a while until it grew out again. I am a licensed cosmetologist and never ever experienced this kind of dilhemma before with a client or myself. As I have always used all kinds of hair treatments but I had never been chemically blonde before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stylist told me it was the protein in the product that caused all the breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use this product again because I always relax and use some kind of color in my hair and as long as I stay away from protein treatments, my hair will look great.</li>
    <li> i relax my hair and was in need of protein badly so i got this and the shampoo. ok first i have to tell you this stuff doesn&#x27;t smaell bad like everybody was saying it smells toxic i had the bathroom door closed and almost died i had to hold my breath the whole time. then on the bottle it says comb it through your hair before it dries which is impossible since it dries so fast and if i did comb my hair it would have fell out and make sure the water is running so you can wash off you hands as soon as your done cause it will stick to your hands, ok after i dried my hair and washed it out i deep conditioned and my hair felt so strong that i didnt feel like i had to be be super gentle with my hair but it was stiff and dry, now that i think about it it&#x27;s been maybe 2 weeks since i put this in and my hair and it has never been drier no matter what i do    EDIT... now that i have been using this for a couple of months i can tell you that while it still smells toxic it works, my hair is so much stronger and to combat the dryness i use cholesterol after im done and i will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> It did what it&#x27;s supposed to do. But it is a two step treatment, and you NEED to follow up with the Aphogee Balancing Moisturizer! The only down side to the product is it can get a little messy, so be sure to have plenty of towels around, and be sure to have water running before you apply so you can wash your hands after.     Just follow the instructions, and you&#x27;ll get great results!</li>
    <li> I have very long hair (mid-back), unprocessed, but plenty of split ends and dryness at the ends.  This product (applied, then followed by the balancing moisturizer as instructed) did make the hair heavier and shinier, but also stiffer and drier, such that it tangles and catches a lot, resulting in even more split ends.  I compensate by using a deep conditioner after washing and a lot of Citrishine, which is a leave-in conditioner.  Prior to Aphogee treatment, one spray of Citrishine on my palms rubbed together then rubbed over my hair was plenty; more made it greasy.  Now I need five or six sprays to keep the hair soft.  So I&#x27;d say this product performs as promised, but it is not the best treatment for long hair with split ends.  From now on I&#x27;ll stick to lots of moisturizing conditioner, and only the lightest of protein treatments.</li>
    <li> Aphogee Protein treatment is great! Use it as accordingly and you will achieve great results!</li>
    <li> great product great price</li>
    <li> Since using the Aphogee system my hair is extremely healthy, strong(as a rope)and soft(as cotton) which promotes and bring about growth, this is the desire for every woman with natural ethnic hair. It&#x27;s a great product for all hair types may it be straight, wavy, curly or kinky. If you&#x27;re into strong and healthy hair then this is the product for you. Love it, love it, love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mixed with black and white and my hair is very course and curly. Even knotty sometimes. I tried this and flat ironed my hair it was super soft like a white girls hair lol. I reccomend this product but it does smell weird.</li>
    <li> I am African-American and have very fine, curly and dry hair.  Recently I was experiencing extreme breakage of my hair.  I considered cutting off my hair and starting from scratch.  My oldest daughter has the same textured hair.  I cut her hair due to breakage and split ends.  Her hair was originally down to her bottom and I cut it to just under her shoulder blades.  I forgot that I even had this product, but found it in my bathroom cabinet.  I was contemplating cutting her hair again when I used this product on her.  Her hair came out beautifully.  It was stronger, thicker, shiny and full of body.  I then used the product on myself and experienced the same results.  I highly suggest using this product followed my the mosturizer.  I also used the Aphogee Shampoo for Damaged hair first.  I think the people who are having issues with this are not following the instructions correctly.  This is a product that I will continue to use every six weeks. I wish that I has used this before I cut my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I have lots of very fine long blonde hair (mid back) that started breaking after trying to correct a botched dye job; so after reading many glowing reviews on MUA I thought I&#x27;d give this stuff a try.  I used a clarifying shampoo, towel-dried my hair, then applied step 1 Protein Treatment. I used a little spray bottle which made application much faster/less messy and I stopped every so often to comb it through my hair. This stuff starts getting really sticky/tacky within a few minutes so you want to make sure you comb it all through your hair while you can. I really didn&#x27;t find the smell offensive at all which is unusual since I&#x27;ve got a very sensitive nose... but this honestly didn&#x27;t bother me at all. Then I used my blowdryer to dry my hair which took at least half an hour on high (I&#x27;ve got thick hair). My hair never got *super* hard but it did get quite stiff, like a stiff but pliable plastic. Then I jumped back in the shower and rinsed it out thoroughly before applying the accompanying step 2 Moisturizing Conditioner. Left that on about 5 minutes and rinsed out and styled my hair.  I love the results! It really cut down on the frizzies and tangles I used to get. My hair is so much softer and smoother and behaves itself a lot longer! I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair! Will definitely repurchase and incorporate this into my routine every couple of months.</li>
    <li> This protein treatment is excellent. Really helps to strengthen my hair. I use it once about every other month. Just pour it on and sit under the dryer, wait for it to harden and then rinse it out. SIMPLE and EASY. But it is messy lol so be careful.</li>
    <li> I lightened my hair three days ago from a dark brown to a very light blonde in two days.  Some parts of my hair is white blonde, but while I did a very serious thing to my hair, I have coarse curly mixed hair that I used the two minute treatment and deep conditioners on about three weeks prior to lightening. So my hair is not incredibly damaged, however it needs some TLC and gentle handling for a few weeks if I want it to be okay!&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for the first time today.&lt;br /&gt;First, I want to say. Ew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell. Imagine this (or don&#x27;t; if you have a cat you know what I mean), if you&#x27;ve ever got a whiff of your cat&#x27;s butt when it was stinky, it smells EXACTLY like that. No lie. I got used to the smell the longer I had it on, but it was gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I shampooed my hair before trying this, it was an insane puddle of soft mush. I&#x27;ll admit it felt nice but my natural hair is coarse!! So that&#x27;s a huge change in texture for me.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions to the T and I AM happy with the results. My hair has about 1/3 of its strength back, it no longer feels like soft mush in most parts. My curl texture (normally tight spirals) is slightly back after this treatment. However it&#x27;s more of a loose spiral and a mixture of soft waves now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say it was an insane change from where I started from but I can see the difference. I can tell I definitely need to continue this every 4-6 weeks. I will also use the 2 minute treatment after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips I have for you.. Read through all of the reviews so that you know what to expect. Your hair gets rock hard and you REALLY need to be 100x more gentle handling it than you usually are.&lt;br /&gt;When rinsing it out, some of the hardness might remain even after more than 6 minutes of rinsing.&lt;br /&gt; That went away for the most part for me after I used the recommended conditioner and my deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, be sure to deep condition your hair after. I do recommendthe balancing moisturizer Aphogee says to follow with. I could feel the difference and I don&#x27;t think my conditioners could have done what it did for my hair (moisturized so quickly) so easily. Plus apparently it restores the proper pH to your scalp/hair. Necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this to another person? Yes. I can see how necessary this product is after lightening or bleaching or heat styling your hair past or close to past no return.</li>
    <li> My hair was damaged by a poorly-performed CHI straightening chemical process. I was afraid 20% of my hair was going to break off after the process, but only a few hairs have broken off. I&#x27;m making this part of my regular routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d had my hair braided with sew-ins for 2 years. The perm had completely grown out but since I wanted to start wearing my hair out again I permed it.  My hair felt like a cottony sponge, if I sweat at all my hair immediately poofed up and my ends would not stay flat no matter what. I had a trim, tried chi silk, bio silk none of it worked. I read so many good reviews about Aphogee 2 step I thought itd be my miracle. Not At All, other people claimed it made their hair instantly stronger  or dry n tangled cause it was so strong, I used exacly as directef and if possible my hair felt mushy &amp; spongier after and a notiable amout out hair startef coming out in comb (and this was 2 weeks after perm. Have used several times since then, the results have not improved. The only reason I gave 2 stars is cause when I did what your told not to do which was use directly after shampooing out perm, then deep conditioned 3 days later my hairs texture felt better than it had in a long time. I actually refused this delivery cause  Beauty4family took so long to send it I just went to Sallys and brought some. Then they ignored my follow up emails, didnt get refund for two weeks. I dont recommend them either.</li>
    <li> I use the single use verison of this product because I couldn&#x27;t see spending $17 for something I only use every 6 weeks. The single treatment is less than $3 at Sally&#x27;s.    I use this product one week before I relax my hair, because I really feel that it makes a difference in streghtening my hair. (I am currently using the Profectiv Perm)    After I have used this and the ApHogee Balancing Moisturizer I rinse it out and use the Two minute reconstruction treatment.</li>
    <li> I used this product four years ago when my hair was extremely brittle, dry, and plagued with split ends. Surprisingly, I saw a difference after a months usage! This product definitely repaired my damaged hair.</li>
    <li> APHOGEE IS A GOOD PRODUCT BUT IT IS NOT GREAT. I LIKE TO CONSIDER THIS A LOW PROTEIN FORMULA. I BELIEVE THIS PRODUCT IS A LITTLE BIT EXPENSIVE FOR A LOW PROTEIN PRODUCT WHEN THERE IS HAIR MAYONAISE THAT WORKS VERY WELL AND IS ONLY 10 BUCKS IN YOUR LOCAL WALMART. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT TO STOP BREAKAGE FROM HAIR BEING WEAK FROM RELAXERS THAN MIZANI KERAFUSE SHOULD BE YOUR CHOICE. ALWAYS MIX IT WITH HYDRAFUSE AND DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT OF YOUR HAIR YOU CAN ALWAYS MIX MORE OR LESS KERAFUSE WITH HYDRAFUSE TO MAKE A LOW PROTEIN CONDITIONER. I HOPE Y REVIEW HAS BEEN HELPFUL.</li>
    <li> Has the most unbearable smell..it reaks of rotten eggs..Only used it once and cleared the room!!! But it works. It truly works..bleached my hair..and used this 2x now my hair is like silk!  If u can bear the smell ..youll absolutley see and feel better hair..!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that I refer to my customers for bad hair breakage. IT is wonderful when you use it correctly. YOu do get under the dryer after washing and let it dry Hard. After rinsing it softly no combing through or combing through until all the product is rinsed out, then use the Balancing Moisterizer. Rinse that out, blow dry or sit under dryer or better yet use the aphogee reconstructor and leave in conditioner and roller set the hair ( or what ever you choose) Honestly the Aphogee line is excellent. Don&#x27;t over use this product the Two Step Deep Conditioner or your going to have reverse effects. After you use this try the two minute conditioning system by aphogee in between. Huh, I can go on and on. But I won&#x27;t Get about $40 together and just get the whole Aphogee line and see for yourself, consistency is the key.</li>
    <li> Smells a little funky, but works better than other protein fillers Iv bought (over $50). Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I have curly type 3b hair shoulder length .My hair was very dry, brittle and breaking off no matter how much moisture I  would add to it.  Someone suggested I try this product. I did and immediately seen results.. I watched several u-tube videos and followed others advice and deep condition with moisture for 30 minutes  after the two step. That&#x27;s the clincher... The protein can be drying so add the extra moisture.  My hair is so soft, moisture stays in longer and breakage is practically gone. Excellent product. just follow directions</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the BEST treatments I have ever given my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product makes your hair feel silky soft and I mean silky soft. Feels like you have a new head of hair. Amazing, I was extremely impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gosh this product stinks. Horrible horrible smell unlike aphogee other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to have the time on your hands to do this... pretty much you gotta wait til it dries on your head.... your hair gets REALLY hard but it is sooooooooooooooo worth it in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to hear about the 1st reviewer with the breakage. I have been using this product off and on since 2001 and never experienced this. Maybe it just didn&#x27;t agree with her hair. I guess maybe people purchasing this whould probably do a strand test or a lock of hair test to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job Aphogee.</li>
    <li> I used this in conjunction with the recommended same brand shampoo/conditioner and used a hand-dryer to harden.  My hair is usually very frizzy, breaks very easily, sheds constantly and has split ends.  After using this my hair was more tangly and got creases from my flat-iron and seemed more brittle, though after I washed it again it has seemed to calm down.  I don&#x27;t know if my less than stellar results are because of my hair type since it is also very dry or the hand-dryer.  I do like the other products by this brand however I think next I will try a keratin treatment instead and see what those effects will be.      As to the smell, it wasn&#x27;t horrible and reminded me of old-school Sun-In that you&#x27;d blow-dry into your hair to get blonde (orange) highlights</li>
    <li> I had extremely damaged hair after going from dyed black to brown, (my hair is naturally dark brown, straight, fine and about 50% gray). After color removal and  several bleach treatments my hair was like straw, would not hold color at all, and my only option appeared to cut it all off. After reading about Aphogee Two-step treatment, I felt like this was my last option (before cutting off the damage!)  I had already tried many conditioning treatments with no improvement including K-pak, coconut oil overnight, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I read up on the application process, as well as all the reviews I could find. I then applied the Aphogee Two-Step with a spray bottle, it is messy and starts hardening in about 5 minutes, so I saturated my hair and then loosely piled it on top on my head, blow dried for 50 minutes until it was hard and seemed as dry as it would get.  Per suggestions from previous reviewers, I reclined in the tub to allow my hardened hair to soften and then showered and rinsed for several minutes. I applied Biolage conditioning balm to my hair for about 5 minutes and rinsed. I added some Its-a-10 and some Fekkai glossing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so after all of this, my hair still looked bad, it was less dry and somewhat healthier looking, but it was not a miracle or dramatic improvement.  I hoped that after coloring it would improve. I waited 24 hours and colored with a non-permanent color, conditioned with Biolage for about 5 minutes, rinsed, towel dried &amp; applied Its-a-10 &amp; fekkai glossing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! My hair looked good, it felt soft and held the color.It&#x27;s been two weeks now and the color still looks great!  There has been a huge improvement and I am very happy that I will not need to cut off all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips:&lt;br /&gt;Apply with a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Plan beforehand where you will place your hair to ensure that it will completely dry, you cannot move it AT ALL once it dries as it may break off!&lt;br /&gt;Wear gloves, the product issticky and a bit irritating to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I used a hand dryer and it worked great, just plan at least 30 minutes of straight blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;Before using, read all the reviews, I found this very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t plan on using it again at this time, but if I do, you need to wait 6 weeks between treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to condition afterwards with  a non-protein condition.&lt;br /&gt;Only use this if your hair is extremely damaged, it is not for healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Where to start? Oh I know where: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!  THIS PRODUCT TOOK MY HAIR OUT!  My hair is thinner and more broken than before.  Even my husband has noticed how thin my hair is (and he rarely notices anything!).  I was not expecting a miracle, I was expecting less shedding and less broken hair.  I read ALL the reviews and was most impressed by the ones that say they only had one or two hairs in the sink or on the comb (sounded like a miracle to me - even so called healthy hair sheds).  OH MY WORD, I watched globs of hair come out.  Before you think about it let me say that I FOLLOWED ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS.  I even watched the tutorials on YouTube.  The only thing did contrary to the instructions was use a leave in conditioner.  After I rubbed the leave in conditioner thru my hair I took my hands away from my hair and placed my hands in front of my face to see globs of hair on my hands.  My breakage was never that bad! In fact my breakage usually only came in blow drying!  Disappointed, devastated, traumatized and writing this review in hopes of saving somebody else the heartache.  FYI: I give this product zero stars.  You see my rating as one because Amazon would not let me post without selecting at least one star.  This product is a waist of time, money and hair!</li>
    <li> I should first note that I have medium-length (nearly mid-back) relaxed (but naturally coarse) hair. I am very into hair care and have accumulated a lot knowledge over the last couple of years via research about how to properly care for African American hair. In the process, I learned about Aphogee Two-Step, a heavy protein treatment. I was wary of it because I had read that it is an extremely strong treatment that turns your hair rock-hard when left to dry and, if used improperly or if your hair does not need protein, can have disastrous results. Despite my worries, I bought this product over a year ago, but had not used it for a long time simply because I was too scared to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to use it recently out of desperation. Though my hair is pretty long, it is typically limp, dull, has very little body, and feels very weak. I&#x27;ve also been having issues with breakage, particularly after washing my hair, and have noticed that I have been losing some of my length. Because I do all other things recommended to care for relaxed hair, I suspected that it was my reluctance to use a lot of protein that was finally taking its toll. I researched heavy protein treatments again and read that if you are relaxed, you almost certainly need heavy protein treatments to counteract the negative effects of the relaxer. I have actually known this for a long time, but, as I mentioned, I was too afraid to use the treatment and convinced myself that because my hair was long, I was doing fine. Wrong! Though I do take care of my hair, the relaxers have been taking a toll on it and I&#x27;m so glad that I finally decided to take the plunge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it once, but have already noticed drastic results. After the entire process was over and I was done detangling, which usually results in the loss of countless small hairs, I saw that I had VERY few broken-off hairs in my comb or anywhere else. I was already sold. Once my hair was dry and styled, I noticed that my hair had more body (it holds a curl much better) and felt stronger (I could pull on it and run my hand through it without also breaking off strands). My hair just has more life and structure and I can&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s time to use it again so that I can continue to see improvements in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I end this (long) review, I just want to advise people about a few things regarding this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Use only every 6 weeks. If used more often than that, you will oversaturate your hair with protein and it will eventually become dry and brittle and break off. If you relax your hair, it is recommended that you schedule these treatments so that you have one either a week before or after a relaxer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t manipulate your hair when it is drying/dry because your hair really does become hard as a rock and it will break off if manipulated. The instructions say to comb it through while it is still wet in order to saturate the hair, but I found that my hair was too sticky and that the treatment was drying too quickly for that. I just sprayed it on with a spray bottle to saturate my hair, quickly finger-combed it through, and sat under the drier with my hair UNCOVERED for 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It is recommended by Aphogee that you use their Balancing Moisturizer immediately after rinsing out the treatment. This is meant to return the pH of your hair back to normal and is not intended to function as a moisturizing deep conditioner, which you will DEFINITELY need to use, as well. It&#x27;s unfortunate that the directions don&#x27;t inform customers of this, as some people won&#x27;t be aware that your hair will become hard and break off if you don&#x27;t follow up with a moisturizing deep conditioner. After rinsing out the Balancing Moisturizer, apply a good moisturizing deep conditioner (look at the ingredients to make sure it has little to no protein in it!) and leave it in your hair (under a plastic cap/bag) for 45 minutes to an hour. Rinse it out, apply yourleave-ins/moisturizers and style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, this stuff smells PUTRID, but it&#x27;s worth it in the end and the smell goes away once the treatment is rinsed out, anyway.stuff smells PUTRID, but it&#x27;s worth it in the end and the smell goes away once the treatment is rinsed out, anyway.</li>
    <li> Bought from Sally&#x27;s.  I used it as instructed exactly on the package.    While it did seem to make a difference in making my hair look and feel more smooth, the stench is overwhelming and lasts for days.    Sorry, but no results are worth the odor from this stuff for me.</li>
    <li> Two months ago, a hairdresser had seriously messed up my hair. My hair has in a relaxer, but its generally really strong and curly - it&#x27;s usually so strong that I can get away with doing things like relaxing my hair one week and coloring it the next without any serious breakage or problems. I put my hair through a LOT actually. Anyways, she bleached my hair and I hated it so two days later, I colored it over w permanent black. My hair was clearly damaged but I decided to wait it out.     I came to NY, and I think combination of climate change AND the fact that everywhere has indoor a/c dried out my hair super fast (my skin also). Everytime I even ran my fingers through my hair, serious clumps of hair were coming out. Everytime I conditioned and detangled, huggge clumps (like two hands full worth) came out, regardless of if it was a few days apart or a week, which has never happened before. I was desperate and started researching and found this treatment. I was skeptical bc of the few bad reviews and bc I wasn&#x27;t sure if protein was what my hair needed.     I bought the product but still debated using it until FINALLY i could take it no longer, my hair either needed to be cut off completely or try something drastic. So I grabbed the product, sectioned my hair in four, detangled with a wide tooth comb, which also left out clumpppps of my hair, washed w Curls clarifying shampoo, then applied the product to each of my four sections, I kinda combed it through with my fingers but I never used a comb at any point. When I was done, I kinda shoved the hair back from my face and added more product, especially on my ends. I sat with a hand dryer (Chi Infratech) and just went back and forth over my hair with the dryer. After 20 mins my hair was dry but I let it stay for an extra 30 minutes.    I was apprehensive about rinsing because I had read all over that agitating the hair too much can lead to breakage. So I just stood under warm water in my shower for about 3 minutes without touching my hair. Slowly and gently, I worked my fingers into my hair to expose it to more water. Honestly, I think I rinsed my hair for about fifteen minutes, just gently taking small sections and smoothing it out as the water an over it bc I didn&#x27;t want to risk breaking. Halfway thru I realized that MY HAIR WAS NO LONGER COMING OUT IN CLUMPS - i was so amazed by this that I literally took every strand that came out and pressed it against my shower walls to count it. After applying the Balance moisturizer, washing it out, and applying Sheamoisture Deep conditioner, ONLY FOURTEEN strands of my hair came out. I&#x27;m simply overjoyed at the fact that my hair has clearly (in this moment) stopped breaking. 14 mite seem like a lot to some ppl, but considering that almos every time i brushed anything thru my hair, huge palmfuls of hair came out (dry or wet, conditioned or not), 14 was like nothing to me.     I would definitely recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s having intense breakage problems, just be sure to follow the directions, watch the youtube tutorials and be gentle!</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair, I&#x27;ve been bleaching and dying it every color for 9 years. Very thin at ends, mushy when wet, crunchy when dry. I used to have loose waves but now it&#x27;s straight and super curly in other places, I seriously thought I was going to have to shave it off. This stuff saved my hair. So happy :) I&#x27;m going to keep my hair and grow it out hah! It&#x27;s shiny again after one use and incredibly soft with even loose waves after air drying. Will be using every 2 weeks until hairs back to normal.</li>
    <li> I purchased the aphogee two-step treatment with the conditioner, the two minutes keratin repair and the green tea spray. They all worked wonder. My relaxed hair is now strong, feels and looks healthy. the only thing is you have to make sure that you properly rinse it and put a lot of conditioner after cause it is really a strong product so any residue will break your hair. My advice is not to use it frequently but 4-5 days before or after relaxing your hair and use a leave in before styling and a moisturizer as a finishing touch.</li>
    <li> Only writing this because I see that someone had some hair issues as a result of this. :( Woldn&#x27;t want someone else ot make the same mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS is a PROTEIN Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;A reconstructor, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purpose of a protein treatment is to strengthen hair. If your hair is limp, stretches to a great extent when pulled, mushy, breaking, etc... then this would helpful to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is dry, brittle, taut when pulled, with no give, &#x27;breaking&#x27; then this would most likely increase your issues. Because it will make the hair dryer, even more brittle and more prone to breakage.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;d most likely need MOISTURE--conditioners and shampoos that moisturize the hair, i.e.,&lt;br /&gt;1. Nexxus Humectress,&lt;br /&gt;2. Elucence MB&lt;br /&gt;3. Aubrey Organics&lt;br /&gt;4. Keracare Humecto, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re not supposed to use this product as you would a regular condition. And you have to know how to assess your own &#x27;hair health&#x27; to know if your issue even warrants the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;The same rules apply whether you&#x27;re relaxed or natural (to varying degrees)...because &#x27;black&#x27; hair is dry hair. The driest of all hair types, I think. Black hair thrives on moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Although--I suspect that relaxed hair may be drier because of the chemicals. Anyway--this is the main reason why it breaks. This is why some ppl have the impression that &#x27;black hair can&#x27;t grow&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;It can...you just have to know how to work around the main issue.&lt;br /&gt;You have to know how to care for black hair properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a protein treatment for months (I have relaxed hair). First I tried Organics hair mayonnaise, and my hair was left weak and breaking. Then I tried Aphogee 2 step protein treatment, and instead of helping, I experienced even more breakage once I was through with it (and I followed the instructions to a T).  I am disappointed, since the reviews shows that this product worked well for others, but not for me.</li>
    <li> Used once and it has brought my hair back from the dead! My hair was within an inch of its life, gummy, snapping off - just horrible after all the bleaching I do. This holy grail bottle of savior has saved my hair. Be warned, the smell is pretty bad but nothing you can&#x27;t get over.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that is thinning as I age.  This protein treatment seems subtle at first, BUT IT WORKS!.  My hair doesn&#x27;t lie flat and has some body.  I can ALWAYS tell when I  am due for another treatment.  Definitely use the Aphogee Balancing Moisturizer just after rinsing and whenever you need to add more moisture in the winter.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for over ten years and i absolutely LOVE it</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product by mistake, I already had one in my cart and forgot to delete the duplicate.. They do make a product that comes in a square plastic package that works much better than this.</li>
    <li> I have been having bad breakage for a while as well as my hair was not very smooth, shiny or healthy due to much abuse over the years. I thought I needed protein because I have not been maintaining my hair for some time now. However, after using this product my hair became worse and the breaking continued. I know this treatment is not for me but the other products in this line works wonders on your hair which is why I cannot bring myself to give this a low rating. I also noticed a lot of people talking about the smell of the product. I did not find any issues with the smell so I am not sure what is so offensive but I also have a high tolerance for smells so maybe I just didn&#x27;t notice. Make sure you assess whether you need this treatment or not because if used too much and you really didn&#x27;t need protein I can forsee it ripping your hair out. I have switched over to hair mayonnaise which is working wonders on my hair. I needed nutrients and not protein. Good luck all and make sure you know that you need it before you try it!</li>
    <li> I did alot of reading about this product before I decided to try it, mostly other people&#x27;s experiences and reviews(makeupalley.com).&lt;br /&gt;  I have hair that is naturally wavey and light brown in color. About a year ago I decided I wanted to go bleach blond, but I did it myself(as I am a college student with no money for the salon) and over time I had really done some damage to my hair. I had colored it back to my natural color, but at this point my hair was a total mess! After I got out of the shower I couldn&#x27;t even began to run my fingers through my hair because my hair would like almost mat together and tangle. All shine, bounce, and just healthy look to  my hair was completely gone. It was sooooo dry and rough too.&lt;br /&gt;  So I decided what the heck, after everything I&#x27;ve done to my hair, just try something to make it healthier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I used this product, I could instantly tell a major difference! Silky, shiny, healthy feeling hair that didn&#x27;t tangle NEARLY as much. And all that hair I was loosing in the shower- not anymore! I was freaking amazed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you do the Aphogee treatment, it is VERY VERY important that you do it carefully and correctly.&lt;br /&gt;1) Shampoo your hair.&lt;br /&gt;2) While still wet/damp from the shampooing, brush out your hair, then apply Aphogee your hair, thoroughly saturating the entire head&lt;br /&gt;3) Use a wide tooth comb, and GENTLY comb through your hair. (It is helpful if at this point you section out your hair)&lt;br /&gt;4) Now take your blow dryer and begin completely drying your hair; move the dryer slowly over your hair, not swinging back and forth. (At this point it is EXTREMELY important that you don&#x27;t try to comb, brush, finger through your hair. It can, and will, snap right off!)&lt;br /&gt;5) Completely dry your hair everywhere, it should feel super stiff, like lots of dried gel in your hair (it is important that it is dried, the treatment doesn&#x27;t work so hot otherwise)&lt;br /&gt;6) Step back into the shower and just let the water run over your hair for about 5 min. without rinsing with your fingers. At this point your hair should feel softened, then you may begin to GENTLY use your fingers to rinse your hair.&lt;br /&gt;7) Once your have gotten the product out of your hair, use a deep conditioner. This, also, is VERY IMPORTANT. Because the protein treatment will leave you hair dry at first, so the DC kinda fills in the gap. And you know the drill with the DC, leave on for 3-5 mins. rinse with cool water to lock in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;8) And voila! Your hair is totally rejuvenated and replenished!</li>
    <li> I am what you call a \\&quot;dye - hard \\&quot;... I dye my hair way too much and go through radical color changes frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My latest adventure was going from black to a platinum blonde... and after bleaching my hair so many times my hair was starting to fall out and chemically cut itself... I&#x27;d continue to get trims to get rid of the fried hair, but, every time I had to rebleach or touch up roots, my hair would go back to the state of fried-dom and hair falling out in clumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair went from halfway down my back and is now right below my ears - I really do not have much more to cut off at this point so I figured I would give this product a try since I love being platinum blonde and don&#x27;t want to redye my hair a completely new color to have to go get it cut again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr - I dye my hair ALOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product completely saved my hair. It does smell awful, but, considering how my hair actually feels like hair again sitting with it for 30 minutes on my head is not that bad... and the smell washes out... and the conditioner that comes with it smells really good - so - deal with the smell its worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**~~ !!!! PLEASE, however, make sure you read the instructions thoroughly as I&#x27;ve read horror stories where some people damaged their hair using this. Don&#x27;t use this if your hair is naturally brittle or dry and make sure you DO NOT comb your hair after the product has hardened or it will come out. !!!! ~~**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soft, shiny, and most importantly, there are no longer chunks of my hair falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use the aphogee shampoo as it said (I have paul mitchell shampoo) and this product worked just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have a professional heat / dryer thing that goes over your head - and it worked just fine. (I lightly blow dried it for 5-10 minutes and then let it sit in my head for 20 minutes to really let it work and harden)&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a lot of women using this are african american - I am not - and this worked wonderfully for my hair type as well :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me, looking for a solution for chemically damaged hair I really recommend this...&lt;br /&gt;((I also used a deep moisturizing conditioner and put in hask placenta as well which further helped my results))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone in a heart beat. Its less than four dollars, you can not go wrong.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner to use once a week.</li>
    <li> Great product for hair treatment and healthy care.</li>
    <li> It works but to messy to apply in your hair. So I used komaza care protein treatment, less messy.</li>
    <li> Just used it for the first time today. I am a black woman with fine hair. I was told I should apply this 7 days before I relax my hair. My hair feels so soft and bouncy. What I did was washed my hair with a moisturizing shampoo, applied the aphoghee, sat under the dryer for 15 minutes, washed it with the shampoo again to make sure it was all out, then a moisturizing conditioner. Afterwards I let it air dry. My hair feels terrific.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and I love it! This is great for giving my hair the protein that it needs. I find myself using this every two months or so. I use a deep Moisturizing conditioner weekly.  Do not use this too often!!  Too much protein can be just as bad as not enough protein in the hair.</li>
    <li> The top on the bottle  was broken and the liquid was spilling inside the box.&lt;br /&gt;Kept it because i didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning and shipping</li>
    <li> I have naturally straight, dark blonde hair, but I had lightened it a couple of times, which caused some damage. My hair looked weak, felt a little mushy and very much like elastic in some spots. My hair is usually very healthy, but after all of the processing, I got to this point. I did several moisturizing treatments, but after looking on YouTube I realized I needed to put protein into my hair. I watched some reviews and bought Aphogee. I used it last night and it made an immediate difference. The texture of my hair is much more like how it normally is, and it&#x27;s shiny and feels strong. My only complaint is that it has an orange color to it, so it made my blonde a warmer color, which I didn&#x27;t really want. You have to use quite a bit of it if you have long hair, and don&#x27;t be scared when you blow dry it and it makes your hair stiff as a board. Just don&#x27;t agitate the hair while it&#x27;s stiff. It will rinse out very easily, you don&#x27;t need to shampoo it out, and then you can do the moisturizing treatment. I&#x27;m so happy it saved my hair, it looked so bad.</li>
    <li> this product i great for damaged hair, especially over processed and bleached hair, you will feel a difference in hair strength right after the first use, fragile bleached hair feels thicker even when it&#x27;s wet after using this conditioner</li>
    <li> After I severely damaged my hair with bleach I dyed it black to make it appear somewhat healthy. My hair was so thin i was scared to do anything with it cuz it constantly broke :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried A Long list of products from hair masks, protein treatments, special shampoos and conditioners. My closet where I store my hair products actually looks like a store itself. None where satisfying enough!...I had a journey allright searching for the right product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to the point of considering to shave my hair off so that it can grow back healthy!! I told my boyfriend about it too. It was so sad but he was willing to stay with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank God I came across this Aphogee product because it saved my hair! My hair feels fuller by the minute I put it in the shower. My thin hair became thick and strong. Shinyy and healthy looking. I was sooo happy and relieved! My hair had bounce. Its just so amazing. A girl stopped me outside to comment how great my hair looked!. She said \\&quot;wow you look like you came out of the salon\\&quot; Come on...what are you waiting for? You gottta get this product! I desire relieve on anyone with damaged hair. You will not regret it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product made my hair stop falling out which is good, but i was expecting my hair to be smoother and shinier.</li>
    <li> I will start by saying I was BSL and thought something was wrong with me..ie.. menopause, thyroid, hormones.. Something had to be wrong because I had tried everything and my hair would not stop breaking off.. needless to say this went on for four months. My hair is now just past my shoulders. The shedding was phenomenal. Detangling took 1 1/2 hours only to comb out waaayyyy too much hair. I spent several hundreds of dollars on several different expensive damage repair shampoo... Let&#x27;s just say CD didn&#x27;t live up to its claim. At least not for my hair. I dug a little bit more and found review on Aphogee and decided to give it one last shot before cutting it all off and going natural, of which, I REALLY did NOT want to do at all. But with the rate that it was breaking I really had no choice at all. I tried the Aphogee Two-Step and the breakage was half that it normally was. three days later I shampoo&#x27;d.. Much less breakage and detangling was a cinch with the booster treatment. Here I am four weeks later, ready for another Aphogee Two-Step treatment and NO breakage at all... If you have severe breakage, spongy, tangly hair, then this product is for you. My hair is even starting to become smooth and feel like hair instead of a sanding block when dry. I will update this review after several months of usage.</li>
    <li> After doing tons of research I decided to try this since my hair had some color damage. Bad idea I was finally getting my hair back to being healthy and this just made me take about 10 steps back :&#x27;( . I have curly, fine hair. I followed directions exactly and after rinsing out step 1 my hair felt kind of soft but then once I did step two and my hair was still wet I thought ok this seems good. I styled my hair and for a while it looked shiny but after a while my hair got extremely dry and frizzy. I looked like a cotton ball on my head. I was freaking out to say the least. The next day on my way to Sally&#x27;s I scratched my head and felt I huge piece of skin that flaked off my scalp. I mean it was the size of my thumb nail. Worse thing ever! I bought a packet of silk elements and coconut oil and thank God that worked wonders. Be careful when using this. I&#x27;m sure it is a good product, but  like I said before its not for everyone.</li>
    <li> Came damaged &amp; leaking so I have requested a refund.  I will have to look for it locally, I guess.  I heard it&#x27;s good stuff though.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!!! Your hair feels different right after the first use!!!! I&#x27;m going to buy the shampoo and conditioner to see if they are also great!!!</li>
    <li> Stop crying. Buy this. Hold your nose. Use it. It will save you from cutting off all of your hair after severe chemical damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a white girl with naturally brunette hair that is wavy on top and curly closer to the nape of my neck. I have colored my hair every color of the rainbow, but the hair I have now had been dyed black for years. After lightening it from black to platinum over the course of a few weeks, the last round of bleach went awry due to timing issues, and my hair was fried. I had my husband cut off about six inches, but my now shoulder length hair was still mushy and if I tried to comb it while it was even damp, it would rip out in chunks. It was sticky and awful. I&#x27;ve had a pixie. I&#x27;ve been cool with doing risky things with my hair. But this length had taken years to grow out. I literally cried. I was ready to cut it all off and start again. I tried every deep conditioning method I could get my hands on. They made it a little better, but I still couldn&#x27;t comb it and it would take over 5 hours to dry naturally. I was afraid to touch my hair. It looked like it was hanging in faux dreadlocks for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I bought some of this from Sally&#x27;s. First off, it smells HORRIBLE and the directions and reviews are a little scary. But I donned some gloves, dampened my hair (I had already washed it a few hours prior to this application, but it had started to dry), and applied the treatment. It took a long time to dry and harden. I would blow dry my hair for about 10 minutes, then wait for 20, blow dry it again for 10, and so on. I noticed a few places weren&#x27;t getting hard, so I applied a little more to those areas. It took about 4 hours total to harden and dry, but I finally got to wash out my hair. It was noticeably less porous immediately. When I had shampooed or conditioned it prior to this, when it was wet, my ponytail would be about the diameter of a baseball. It was immediately about half that size, which was closer to my normal thickness. I conditioned it heavily, then used a leave-in conditioner when I got out of the shower. I can finally get a comb through my hair, and although there are still a few places that are breaking, it is greatly improved. It started drying more quickly, and looks less damaged. I applied the first treatment about two weeks ago, and I am going to go through another round today. They recommend every 4-6 weeks, because too much protein can cause your hair to be brittle too, but I can tell that it&#x27;s not quite back to normal yet, and it was SO devoid of protein before, I think it can handle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have bleached-to-death hair, buy this and some purple shampoo (use about every three days), and condition your hair regularly. Try to avoid applying too much heat (from blow dryers or straighteners), and be gentle. But it&#x27;s going to be okay. You got this.thickness.

    <li> first time blonde - went from jet black hair to platinum blonde. Obviously it got super damaged. After 1st application of Aphogee it was incredible - much softer and manageable! used it 3 times already - once a week and results are amazing. The only negative is that it&#x27;s too runny - &amp;#34;liquidy&amp;#34; but you can live with that as it works a like a magic wand :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle. I have very thick hair and a lot of it. I straighten it regularly and it&#x27;s never really looked damaged despite my &amp;#34;abuse.&amp;#34; Recently, however, I have been into curling it, and I must have had the iron up too hot, or not used the right protectant because my hair BURNED. It became fried feeling and looked like straw. It also SMELLED so bad...when I got my hair wet it smelled like a campfire and I could not get rid of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I used this treatment and it fixed my hair. The burned smell is gone (and I had tried sooo many other things to get rid of the smell, to no avail). My hair is smoother, softer, shinier and all around healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was nervous at first - when I completed step one my hair became so hard and I was worried that the product was doing more harm than good. But, I followed the directions, rinsed the protein treatment and applied the balancing conditioner and my hair came out so gorgeous. I would highly recommend this product for those with damaged, dry hair. But, be sure to follow the directions and don&#x27;t use it too often.</li>
    <li> I tried this today after reading many positive review. First of all I did not think it smells horrible, just not a pleasant scent. Second it is very strong and can be irritating to skin. The collagen is what hardens the hair and of course because hair is really skin that grows out of live follicle much like our nails grow from the nail bed, it hardens and the skin will get dry and itchy if it gets on skin. The roughest part was combing through with wide tooth comb because it starts to dry quickly. I didn&#x27;t like that part. I did follow the directions to the letter, however I was not sure how long to sit under the dryer. My hair was hard rather quickly but I knew it was not dry down to the roots, but some of the bad reviews made me nervous so after 15-20 minutes I rinsed it out without any manipulation to my hair. Once it was out I then gently made sure I lift areas of hair to get it all out. I used the part 2 following directions again.  After rinsing it is was softer. I may have not left it on longer enough to dry down into the roots though.  I then decided I didn&#x27;t want to take a chance so I deep conditioned with Miss Jessie Super Sweetback with baggy and dryer for 30 minutes.  I may not have the best strengthening results.  I will see how it goes.  I just do not want breakage. I am not sure I will use it again.</li>
    <li> If I could give it a zero I would, it made my hair tangle so bad I lost so much hair when I detangled it, I follow the instructions carefully, it made my hair dry, knotted and horribly hard, I almost spent a whole bottle of conditioner, in my entire life I never experienced so much breakage and shedding, beware!!</li>
    <li> I am Puerto Rican with wavy hair that has been color processed to death.  I love changing my color., using hair pieces and wear updos.  All of these things can really break your hair.  When I see trouble approaching after a color, all I have to do is use this two step process. This product restores my hair every time, no fail. My daughter is half African American and half Hispanic an has mixed hair. She does not relax, but she does color and highlight and sometimes flat irons.  This product has also helped recover her hair when needed. Some notes:  The product smells terribly, so rinse it thoroughly and carefully, then do the balance conditioner, and finish with a nice deep conditioner that is NOT protein-based. The excess protein is counter-productive. Another thing that I noticed is that if I wait three days until the next shampoo my treatment last longer.  If I desire to dry and flat iron after rinsing the conditioner, the hair is extra shiny. If I decide to air dry and let my hair curl, the curl is more even and structured. My daughter has experienced the same results.  Do not use it just before coloring you hair, do the treatment after. Lastly, I have both used a cap and dried my hair for 10 minutes or until set, or just air dry and had the same results.  I recommend you wear gloves and put Vaseline around your neck, ears, wrist, shoulders and forehead so that the protein does not stick to your skin, since it can itch a little. If your hair is really in a bad way do the treatment twice a week for two weeks, then stop, wait six weeks and do it again.</li>
    <li> This is the most disgusting hair product I have ever used. Not only is the smell and texture horrendous, but it clearly makes no improvement on hair texture what so ever. Just pour beeswax on your hair instead for a cheaper rendition of this product, however that may smell better, be less sticky, and work better. Wish someone reviewed this before I wasted hard earned money on it. This &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; is a joke.</li>
    <li> Este producto es excelente el cambio se ve la primera vez que lo usas deja el cabello como nuevo, yo vivo en un sitio muy humedo y el frizz es mi peor enemigo con esto no me preocupo mas por el frizz y dejo secar mi cabello al aire libre y queda espectacular, si lo quieres secar o pasar la plancaha para variar es sumamente facil de conseguir un liso perfecto, pero simplemente no es necesario creeme solo lavarlo y colocar el producto es suficiente.</li>
    <li> I purchased this with a somewhat pessimistic attitude, thinking it would be another overpriced no-results treatment. I didn&#x27;t even use the recommended paired shampoo before or conditioner after and got FABULOUS results, my hair is super soft!! I use this once a month to reduce breakage and crunchiness. The treatment itself stinks like hell, and make sure you DON&#x27;T comb or agitate hair with the product in, as during the treatment your hair can be even weaker than normal. But let it dry thoroughly, wash it out gently, deep condition, and enjoy the great results! You will be amazed!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and my hair goes through a lot of stress. Lately, I decided to high light my hair and it turned it into an elastic-y, stretchy, mushy mess. I immediately decided to cut it off, but I went home and did some research and came across this. It arrived yesterday and I did the first treatment. Already, my hair does not have that elastic-y look at the end of my hair. The hair feels much better, but will need another treatment sooner than the recommended time. I did a deep conditioning treatment overnight afterwards. It still has some stretch to the ends, but the breakage is much better. However, it did strip my color some, but that was understandable since my hair was already in such bad shape. Hopefully, the second treatment helps my hair even more!!! For any one that is skeptical or unsure, just try the trial size. If your hair is anything like mine was, this is worth a shot!!!! Especially if you don&#x27;t want to cut it off and start all over!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of good reviews I had read somewhere else. My hair ended up turning to straw with natural curls just hair looking like it was going haywire. I looked up the ingredients and this is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;the second ingredient is Sodium Laureth Sulfate,&lt;br /&gt;According to Mecola there are over 16,000 Studies about the negative effects of Sodium Laureth Sulfate which is in our detergents, toothpaste, hair products and make-up. We are bathing and slathering on tons of chemicals each day- do we really want to put stuff that is carcinogenic in our scalps to sit there for 5 minutes? Here&#x27;s just a little info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  According to the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep: Cosmetic Safety Reviews[6] , research studies on SLS have shown links to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Irritation of the skin and eyes&lt;br /&gt;  Organ toxicity&lt;br /&gt;  Developmental/reproductive toxicity&lt;br /&gt;  Neurotoxicity, endocrine disruption, ecotoxicology, and biochemical or cellular changes&lt;br /&gt;  Possible mutations and cancer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before because african american women who use heavy relaxers are usually the ones that uses reconstructors on their heads. There has been an astronomical increase in cancer in women over the past 15 years- and no one is really studying the correlations. Educate yourself and fellow women if you can ladies! xo</li>
    <li> Okay, so when I went to Sally I was very skeptical about buying this produce because it can dry your hair and if your not careful when it dries you can break it off. But for me I had been dying my hair red for a over a year when I decided to go silver. I had to bleach my hair 5 times bed for I got all the red ou. My hair was like a niddle the ends were mushing off. After I got it silver I cut it. My hair was super dry! I had tried a couple different masks and a deep conditioner. I finally did purchase this(make sure u get the second step for it a super deep conditioner or mask. I did exactly as it said. I washed my hair with sulfate free shampoo and towl damp dried it. I put the aphogee on it combed it all through and  then blew it dry til it was stiff. I rinsed it out and could feel it was already smoother. It really helped my hair feel stronger. No this is not a miracle hair worker your hair isn&#x27;t gonna be like bran new Lucius  locks but it will help seal your hair and add protien to strengthen it. My hair isn&#x27;t breaking off. This really  did help a lot!! I recommend it but only if you are Gojng to use it exactly like it said! I will use it every 6-8 weeks to keep it healthy because I have friend my hair so badly. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aphogee products for a long time now.  I know a lot of you out there have some not so good things to say about Aphogee Two-Step Protein so I am going to try to set the record straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This is a serious protein treatment for chemical processed, shedding, heat damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;2. This product should be used AT LEAST every 6 weeks.  I do a treatment every 8-12 weeks, this is NOT a weekly conditioner treatment.&lt;br /&gt;3. You must follow directions very carefully&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this product, I wash my hair with a Sulfate Free Shampoo, Use the Treatment, then I saturate my hair in Oil, such as Coconut Oil or Olive Oil.  Yes, this product drys your hair out, but that is because it is literally building your hair back up.  You will need the Oils to replenish the moisture.  I then let my hair airdry ONLY.  The next wash I will do a hot oil treatment or a deep moisture conditioner and at that time I will flatiron if I decide. I am African American with wavy that can get overprocessed hair and my hair tends to shed a lot, but when I use this treatment the shedding is at the very bare minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review help!!!</li>
    <li> I decided to use this 2-step treatment after seeing the wonders it did for my mother&#x27;s hair many years ago. As a result of taking hormone-increasing medication, my hair began to fall out. At first it began to she&#x27;d and after a while the shedding turned into clumps of hair falling out whether or not I interfered with it. I was nervous, but decided to give the treatment a try before cutting my hair completely off. My hair is long ( waist length), thick, and wavy/curly. I bought the 4oz two step, balancing moisturizer, and provitamins leave-in conditioner. I followed the directions carefully as I did not want to make matter worst. After using the balancing moisturizer and leave-in, I began the tedious process of detangling, and to my surprise the hair was already reduced from clumping to shedding. I was even more impressed the next day when the hair only shed a few strands after combing, which is what I am accustomed to. I will definitely recommend and use again if necessary in 6 weeks. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> make sure you know how to use it hair can be damaged if not used correctly</li>
    <li> Amazing Product! I washed my hair with the Aphogee Shampoo for Damaged Hair. I them used the Protein Treatment. I did not use a cap I used a blow dryer and dried the product. My hair was rock hard. I washed it out and then used the Aphogee 2 Minute Keratin treatment left it on for 30 minutes no heat just a shower cap. Washed it out blow dried my hair and sprayed some Shea Moisture Reconstructive Spray on it. It turned our Beautiful!!! Way less hair in the comb then ever before. Very bouncy and shiny! I am in love!!!!! ( African American with relaxed textured hair. Some noticeable damage to my ends)</li>
    <li> I should start things off by saying I nearly never write reviews, but this product was so amazing that I felt it warranted a lengthy review.&lt;br /&gt;I have been a compulsive &amp;#34;dye hard&amp;#34; for the past year: bleaching, dying and mutilating my naturally auburn, curly hair more frequently than my poor follicles could keep up with. I would bleach sometimes twice in a night and I was no stranger to 40 vol. I&#x27;ve had every color in the rainbow on my short hair, sometimes two colors in the period of a week. To sum things up for you, my hair was absolutely totaled: it was stringy, gummy and mushy. I panicked, as at my current hair length (jaw) I can&#x27;t afford to trim damaged ends. Before I used Aphogee, I  was trying coconut oil, which worked okay, but not exactly a miracle. Tonight, I used the Aphogee stuff (sans the 2nd step, the moisturizer) and it worked AMAZING. I remarked, &amp;#34;my hair feels like HAIR again!!&amp;#34; While my hair is by no means healthy yet, it is WAY improved: less shedding/breakage, overall healthier and stronger feel and even shinier. Definitely get this stuff if your hair is at its breaking point. (By the way: the smell IS noxious, but not as bad as it&#x27;s been made out to be. I got used to it within 10 minutes, tops.)</li>
    <li> I dunno, between this and the two minute reconstructor, I&#x27;d have to say that the reconstructor does a better job of strengthening my hair. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but I&#x27;ve done this protein treatment twice so far (once every six weeks) and it only strengthens my hair for 24-48 hours and then my hair starts breaking again. The reconstructor on the other hand lasts me for a week, which is good because I do a protein deep conditioner once a week along with a moisturizing conditioner twice a week. I do plan on finishing this up, but after that I&#x27;m probably going to try something from Nexxus or Aubrey Organics... their products seems to give me good results, so here&#x27;s hoping their protein products work wonders.</li>
    <li> I am a 50+ year old African American woman with fine, soft, fragile, shoulder length hair. Since my late 40&#x27;s I have been experiencing dryness, breaking and shedding :-( I had stopped wearing white shirts, because my shedding dark hair would be all over my back. In an attempt to improve the condition of my hair, I decided to try the Aphogee Two Step Protein treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions to the \\&quot;T\\&quot;. WARNING:  the protein treatment has a putrid odor (sort of like the smell of vomit--sorry just being honest). Once I thoroughly washed out the hardened protein treatment, I followed up with 30 minute deep moisturizing treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I saw no improvement/change in my hair :-( . I shampooed/conditioned my hair again about four days later, I could really feel the improvement.  My hair felt strengthened, soft, tangle free and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who is experiencing breakage and shedding. I will use the treatment again in about 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> I use this probably every 4-6 weeks to give my hair a little extra strength and smoothness. I also use the second step and although, I dont really care for how sticky it is, it does seem to improve the texture of my hair. Basically, you wash your hair and coat it with this product (it is sticky and a little gross) Make sure that you get ALL of your hair, especially the top of the back. You then sit under a dryer or use a hand dryer (DO NO AGITATE HAIR) until it is rock hard. I mean literally like a pack of egg noodles, which can take 30+ minutes.  after that you rinse it out and apply step 2. Step 2 then softens the hair and leaves it silky smooth. In my opinion, it really is a 2 step process. I thought the price on amazon was great and I tried it because 4 different people told me about it. I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. I am african american with bra strap length, wavy/curly hair that is dyed.</li>
    <li> I felt nothing even I tried it again after 1 month didn&#x27;t do any  thing to my hair</li>
    <li> I love this product. I didn&#x27;t see the change the first time but with continued use of this product as well as taking proper care of my hair, I have seen great results. You have to follow the instruction and also figure out whether or. It your hair needs protein. If your hair is damaged because it lacks moisture this product will not help you, and may actually worsen your case. It is amazing when used for what it is intended for.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much for my heat damaged pieces but overall my hair felt stronger. People exaggerate about the smell tho. It&#x27;s bad but not HORRIBLE</li>
    <li> I am a Caucasian woman with bleach blonde hair. As a woman that regulalarly does my roots - every 3 weeks or so - I of course have damaged, breakable, thin hair from so many years of bleaching. I use this product to keep my hair on my head!! It does help with breakage. I use it every other time before I do my roots. Helps with that bubble gum texture that you can get with bleached hair. Highly recommend for us Blondies :)</li>
    <li> Results are better than expected for me so far. I used it for the first time eight days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 4C-Z hair, use a lot if Aubrey Organics products and mix my own as well. But I have breakage and tangling issues.  Usually, my bathroom floor is full of little hair balls when I do anything with my hair (like twist, detangle,etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was nervous about using this at first but for the past eight days...no hair balls on my bathroom floor. It&#x27;s amazing. I hope this will continue. This is how I used it:&lt;br /&gt;1) I did a moisture conditioner (about 5 mins while in shower with plastic cap) using the Balancing Moisturizer the day before.&lt;br /&gt;2) I used this product as instructed (I used a blow dryer)&lt;br /&gt;3) I finished with the Balancing Moisturizer (for about 30 mins with a plastic cap)...I was nervous -:)...I don&#x27;t know if the extra time makes any difference&lt;br /&gt;4) Rinse, spray Aloe Vera juice as leave-in and seal with my oil mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result: My hair was healthy looking, manageable and I would say more than 90% less breakage even after eight days. I usually do some conditioning every other day to combat dryness, dullness and breakage. this past week, I just spritz my hair with some moisture in the evening. I like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviews from others helped...so thanks for them...and I figure that&#x27;s my way of contributing 2!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009R33U8 Aphogee Two-step Treatment Protein for Damaged Hair 16 oz.]]This product really does work, follow directions exactly and your hair will be repaired.  My daughter had completely fried hair after a bad high lighting, the hair was so damaged she was going to cut it all off.  We tried the aphogee 2 step treatment and her hair was repaired to the point that she loved it.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> OMG i had to check the ingredients to see if it was made from unicorn milk and dragon secretions because this stuff is MAGICAL! I have natural 3c 4a hair. I&#x27;ve ben under a lot of stress so my hair was very weak and had lots of breakage. It  was just bad. My friend recommended this product. I tried it after watching a few tutorials. I moisturizer my hair heavily first. Washed it. Applied the aphogee. Blow dried it. Rinsed it out and added a deep conditioner for a few hours. Normally when I wash my hairs I loose about 50 strands...i washed my hair after applying the aphogee..I only lost 5 strands. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. This product is great. I have read that you can use too much protein on your hair so I don&#x27;t recommend using this weekly. And also use lots of moisturizing conditioners as your hair can dry out. Otherwise I give this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have fine blonde hair, just below my shoulders. I&#x27;ve used Loreal 9.5nb to keep my roots at bay for the last 10 yrs, and have always been really happy with that. For some reason I decided to treat myself to a professional color/hi light. Worst mistake ever! My hair was destroyed! I hated to wash it because it felt like mushy cotton candy when wet, and even using top of the line conditioners, it took forever to comb out, ever. so. gently. And then I would still end up with HANDFULS of broken hair. It was devastating. I won&#x27;t lie, I cried many times at my bathroom sink over the last couple of months. I prayed for something that could strengthen my hair and make it stop breaking. It took me 2 years to get to this length and i didnt want to have to cut it off. I would stay up late into the night reading everything I could find online. I kept hearing about this stinky 2 step protein treatment....why, oh why didn&#x27;t I order it right then?? I guess I was a bit intimidated by the whole \\&quot;rock hard hair\\&quot; thing, and still shell- shocked over the damage to my hair. Honestly, I was terrified of doing more harm. I ended up noticing it in my \\&quot;save for later\\&quot; cart here on amazon and went ahead and ordered it earlier this week. It arrived today, and since my girls were napping I decided to be brave and go for it. BEST THING I HAVE DONE FOR MY HAIR, maybe EVER!!!! I used a spray bottle to apply it evenly, didn&#x27;t comb it thru, because, well, I&#x27;m so scared of combing my hair nowadays. And I sure didn&#x27;t want to comb it wet with this shellac stuff on it! I aimed the blow dryer at it and it got amazingly plasticky feeling. I was nervous that it wouldn&#x27;t rinse out well, but it rinsed super easily! As soon as the water hit it, it softened right up and I could tell my hair was different! :) :) I conditioned with the step 2 (which someone had described as smelling old ladyish. And it does. She said it helped to imagine Dolly Parton doing your hair in the shop from Steel Magnolias, which I found hilariously accurate! :) and let me tell you, when I took that towel off my head, I could run my fingers thru my damp hair!! I used a spritz of my regular leave in (aveeno nourish + condition) out of habit, but I don&#x27;t think I even needed it. Worked in some fructose xl body mousse, and styled it with my blowdryer, did a little dance around my bathroom and ran to grab my iPad to order 4 more packets of this wonderful stuff! And to leave this review. Hoping it helps someone else not be a chicken like I was. I seriously can&#x27;t stop touching my hair right now.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aphogee products for about 3 years when I first started getting into hair care and caring for my own hair.  In fact, I love the Aphogee 2 minute reconstructor and I use it almost every time I wash! However, I have always been too afraid to try the 2 step protein treatment after having read/heard countless horror stories. The first two years of my &amp;#34;hair journey&amp;#34; went really well. I went from not quite shoulder length hair to bra strap length (BSL) hair. But for the last year, I have noticed that I haven&#x27;t retained much length at all, and my hair is still at BSL after an entire year. Despite using really good hair practices: low manipulation, protective styling, deep conditioning,  moisturizing/sealing, etc. That&#x27;s when I knew it was time to break out the big guns! As my hair has gotten longer, and therefore older, it was time for a seriously strengthening product and this was just the ticket! Most other reviewers have done a good job of conveying how hard your hair becomes and how careful you need to be when handling the hair, and the importance of using the balancing moisturizer. I agree with all those sentiments. You do have to study the instructions provided and adhere to them with vigilance.  Another thing I&#x27;d like to add to the conversation is that I also use the balancing moisturizer as a part of my normal wash day routine. It works a lot like Roux PC and seems to close the cuticle, and instantly makes my hair softer, particularly when I use it after relaxing my hair (I use it in addition to a deep conditioner, not instead). Anyway, back to the treatment, I immediately noticed less breakage, and my hair instantly appeared thicker! Noticeably so! I assume that this may be due to it restoring much of the lost protein from relaxing. All I have to say is don&#x27;t be afraid to try this product if you&#x27;re experiencing breakage that persists despite supplementing hair with moisture, especially if your hair is on the longer side. I so wish I had tried this product a year ago, so I might have retained more length! Lesson learned! To be on the safe side, I deep conditioned with a moisture conditioner immediately following the 2 step process, but my hair honestly didn&#x27;t feel like it needed it since it was adequately softened from the balancing moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Would Yall Recommend This For&lt;br /&gt;Ombre Hair Look ? I Have Lots Of Split Ends My Bottom Hair Is Really Damaged i Have A Blonde Color At The Bottom - i Order This Product Online At Sally&#x27;s Yet Im Scared For My Hair To Get More Damaged .</li>
    <li> Be aware that Some hair can not tollerate certian protein treatments. But I have used this treatment for a year now every six weeks and my hair has remained a healthy bouncy curly mass. I used it before i decided to stay natural on chemically straightened hair and it helped the damage... but now it does wonders for my curls because i still dye my hair often and even used it just one day after bleaching it and it saved my hair from all the damage... love this product, is my go to treatment. I buy it locally at sallys or at the hair shop nearbye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw i am mixed and have type 3 hair...</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and highly recommend it. Several years ago I grew my hair long and this was the key to keeping it healthly during the transition.  I had stopped using it for awhile when I started wearing my hair short, but starting having issues with my hair breaking and shedding. I started using it again a few months ago and my hair is healthy once again and growing nicely. It is very important to follow the directions with this product.  I follow up with the recommended Aphogee balancing moisturizer, but I follow that with a second moisturizing conditioner. Although the Protein conditioner is great, I don&#x27;t think the Aphogee moisture works great on my hair (that&#x27;s why I follow up with a second one). I now use this every 5 weeks and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
    <li> Since I was transitioning I decided to try this product. I heard good things about Aphogee and was in desperate need of a protein treatment to stop breakage. I can&#x27;t say this product doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m just not seeing any results for my hair but I will give it another try maybe under the drying for a little while since protein treatments and heat is not such a good idea on transitioning hair. I still would recommend Aphogee because it does get my hair nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try and repair some serious styling I had done to my hair based on the recommendations of my stylist and I was relatively pleased.  It did help my hair but it was quite honestly such a chore to use at home I don&#x27;t see myself as ever using it again...unless I really fry it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells pretty bad to me and is SO STICKY that I was really afraid I was going to do more damage than good.</li>
    <li> So my hairdresser said that I should start to use a protein reconstructor. This Aphogee 2-step treatment protein was my 2nd go to product (I tried Nexxus Polymedic Reconstructor 1st and it&#x27;s okay, but I like Aphogee better). The stuff smells horrible and it&#x27;s very runny, yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it to my hair and then blow dried it for 10 minutes until the stuff made my hair rock hard. Then I washed it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed with the Aphogee balancing moisturizer. For ANY type of protein reconstructor, it&#x27;s very important to use some type of balancing moisturizer to restore the pH of your hair back to normal. If not, you WILL experience breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My curl pattern turned out very nice and my hair felt silky and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I will stick to this product. Not a bad find.</li>
    <li> This protein treatment caused more breakage in areas that had issues, and strengthened already healthy parts of my hair.  I did not need more strength added to already healthy areas, I needed the more brittle areas to be more stable.  My hair is fine but thick and can get damage easily.  I have to color it every 3-6 months with a natural hair product (Naturtint) because it gets damaged easily.  I had heard that this works best for black hair, however I was told it&#x27;s also great if you are white, but it doesn&#x27;t seem the case after reading other reviews with similar problems.  I have used Nexxus in the past as well as Joco and both helped add more stability to my hair, but after using this two-step treatment exactly as the instructions read, my hair has more split ends and breakage than ever before.  I will definitely not be using it again and I do not recommend it to other people with similar hair to mine.</li>
    <li> I FOUND THIS PRODUCT ON AMAZON LAST YEAR AFTER I HAD TO CUT  MY HAIR FROM ALL THE BREAKAGE I HAD, SO I FIGURED I GIVE IT A SHOT WHAT ELSE DO I HAVE TO LOSE. ANYWAY AFTER GETTING THE TWO-STEP PROTEIN TREATMENT MY BREAKAGE INSTANTLY STOPPED I WISH I WOULD OF FOUND THIS BEFORE I HAD TO CUT MY HAIR. I WOULD DEF RECOMMAND THIS TREATMENT TO ANYONE WITH DAMAGED HAIR OR SERVE BREAKAGE. YOUR SUPPOSE TO USE IT EVERY 6 WEEKS I STOPPED USING IT AND MY HAIR BROKE OFF REALLY BAD AGAIN :( SO NOW I AM GOING TO CONTINUE TO USE IT EVERY 6-8 WEEKS UNTIL MY HAIR STRENGTHENS BACK.</li>
    <li> I straighten my natural, fine, 3C hair 1-2 times a year. After straightening, my hair tends to shed a little more than usual when I handle my hair. When that happens after straightening/curl wanding/etc, I run to this stuff and it stops the problem dead in its tracks. After using this treatment, only one - if any - hairs come out when I detangle or handle my hair in any way.    The only downside to this product is the amount of time spent doing it. For me, spending a couple hours on my hair is excessive. I hate having to spend long amounts of time on my hair, and I definitely spend more time than I&#x27;d like washing, applying this treatment, DRYING this treatment, and then rinsing it out. I dread having to do it, but I do anyway because the results are worth it.    It does a great job bringing the life back to my hair. My hair&#x27;s elasticity tremendously improves, it&#x27;s stronger, and there&#x27;s less shedding. I never have any concerns or worries about straightening, curling or blowing out my hair because this protein treatment has never failed me; it always brings my hair back to looking like its beautiful self.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for three weeks now, (I&#x27;m african american &amp; wash my hair weekly) &amp; I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had years of coloring &amp; relaxing my hair, so I&#x27;ve had dry hair, split ends, &amp; constant breakage. My hair never seemed to grow past shoulder length.  Health &amp; hair care professionals say you&#x27;re supposed to shed like 100 hairs a day, but I&#x27;m noticing that my hair sheds far less than that, if it sheds at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first usage, my hair felt stronger. I usually air dry my hair &amp; then flat iron it. Usually, when the flat iron neared my split ends, hair would start to break. Now, my hair feels stronger &amp; like it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to follow the instructions when using this product and I&#x27;d recommend applying it in the shower, to keep the mess to a minimum. If you fully coat your hair, the product will run, so you&#x27;re going to want to wrap your neck in a towel. Try to wrap your hair or have it up, without something holding it up. You could sit for 40 min &amp; let this stuff air dry, but when using this product, I just blow dry my hair on a medium setting. As your hair begins to dry, it will still look wet, but it will become very hard. Be careful not to agitate your hair or try to comb through it, or you&#x27;ll risk breakage. After your hair is dry, simply hop back in the shower, gently wash the treatment out &amp; apply a deep conditioner -- then you&#x27;re done!</li>
    <li> It did what it says it will do. Love it for my hair.</li>
    <li> It seens I can get the moisturizer where I live what can I do or if there any other balance moisturizer I can get. I have to say the 1 time I use this product my hair broke up like even more than before I use it because I didn&#x27;t know&lt;br /&gt;I have to use the moisturizer now I&#x27;m looking to buy one but I can get it where I live... Please any suggestions</li>
    <li> THIS SAVED MY HAIR. I cannot recommend highly enough. I have highlights and coarse, thick wavy hair. After my last highlight job my hair was brittle and breaking off. I was desperate and bought multiple products, from Joico&#x27;s K Pak to Kerastase to various protein treatments and oils. I spent a ton of money looking for results, but nothing came close to this product. It is VERY powerful and yes, it does smell awful, but the end results are literally hair-saving. If you need extreme repair, get this and carefully follow the directions. I am so happy I finally found this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m transitioning it&#x27;s been 16 months and I saw some video reviews on YouTube which prompted me to make the purchase.  The process itself is gross to say the least please wear an old shirt and use an old towel as the product drips everywhere.  Once it&#x27;s dried you can either sit under a hooded dryer or if you don&#x27;t have the patience use a regular hair dryer to harden the product do not manipulate your hair at all.  Once it was hardened I got back in the shower and rinsed out the product and applied the balancing moisturizer and left it on for about 5-7 mins.  The end result was super soft hair my curls bounced right back and I had significantly less breakage on my second round of using the product.  I did pre-poo my hair with coconut oil before washing which helps retain the moisture and prevent breakage I don&#x27;t use shampoo to clarify I co-wash with conditioner and use an apple cider vinegar rinse to get all the gunk out.  With this product I have noticed significant growth, less breakage and a more defined curl pattern I intend to keep using this product every 6 weeks in addition to my castor oil regime I&#x27;m managed to regrow my hairline following breakage from a bad hairstyle - tree braids braided into my fine baby hairs - NEVER again, thank you Aphogee!!</li>
    <li> i used this product yesterday. i&#x27;m aware thats its a heavy duty protein product, thats why i&#x27;m confused as to why it left my hair silky soft but not stronger. my hair is still breaking the same amount while it is wet. I used a clarifying and moisturizing shampoo, put the treatment, did exactly what the instructions say. use the balancing moisturizer , my deep conditioner and the rinse that came with it. could it be that my hair needs more protein? 6 weeks from now i will try this product again to see if the issue is my hair or the product.</li>
    <li> This product really does repair damaged hair. It is applied every 6 weeks. My hair was breaking severly, no shine and no body, after about 2 treatment I saw a big difference, it looks very healthy with lots of body and its not breaking near as much.</li>
    <li> I just used this the other day for the first time and if you don&#x27;t know when you use a protein treatment you have to follow behind with a super moisturizing and hydrating deep conditioner or it will dry your hair out. I left the treatment on of course under the dryer until it hardened. Then I sat under the dryer with a deep conditioner for about 20 minutes and I have not flat ironed my hair in 4 months and when I say my curls snapped back after this treatment, I mean they snapped back! Its been almost a week since I used it and my curls are still as tight as if I had done the treatment yesterday. I recommend this to anyone who has heat damaged hair or color damaged hair I greatly recommend this. 2 thumbs way up!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!!!  I used it like everyone else and sat under the dryer until it was hard.  Then rinsed it out and immediately felt the difference in my hair.  Soft, shiny, silky, and much much stronger.      What they don&#x27;t tell you is two things:    1) make sure you use the ApHogee Balancing Moisturizer immediately following this treatment because it is a very powerful product.  The Balancing Moisturizer does just that--balances your hair; and    2) don&#x27;t use this treatment more frequently than every six weeks.  That will most certainly cause this extremely powerful product to over-process and break off your hair.    Don&#x27;t believe me?  Check out the results of another believer on [...]    Trust me...buy and use the products together for the best results without any damage whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Buy this product and do your own protein treatments at home if you are experiencing shedding and damage. I have noticed a dramatic difference in my hair since using Aphogee and 100% Argan Oil. Check my other reviews. This and Biotin have my hair 5 inches longer and way less shedding. My hair is 3 inches away from touching my rear end. Which is crazy long hair for a black girl! Everyone thinks I have a weave. When they find out I dont&#x27; they ask what have I been using. Even my hair stylists was like, what are you doing to your hair, it&#x27;s healthy, gorgeous and longer than ever. I just smiled.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, coarse relaxed hair that was shedding. I used this product to replace some of the protein lost during chemical processing and to stop the hair shed. I followed the instructions to the letter and followed up with an &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34; deep moisturizing treatment. My hair felt stronger; no more shedding like before but it was still rough. I continued my deep conditioning moisturizing treatments in an attempt to infuse some moisture back into my hair. I broke down and finally tried the balancing moisturizer also which was nothing but a waste of time and continued applying every moisturizing conditioner I had at my disposal, even to the point of buying new ones to combat the dryness. This was all a waste of time. My hair which was previously BSL was reduced to a tangled, matted, dreaded (literally) mess. It has been one month since I used the treatment and I still haven&#x27;t removed all the mats and tangles and my hair is only marginally softer than it was; translation, it&#x27;s still rough and noticeably thinner due to the hair that has already been lost. I already know that I&#x27;m going to have to chop off I don&#x27;t know how many inches when all the tangles are finally removed. I know that not all products will work for everyone, but this is one product that should be approached with extreme caution. It&#x27;s one thing to use a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t quite give you the slip you&#x27;re looking for or a shampoo that&#x27;s a little too stripping; it&#x27;s a whole other thing when you use a product that results in massive hair thinning or loss even when following the directions. I would have been better off just letting my hair shed.</li>
    <li> I had a $250 keratin/Brazilian blowout treatment,  which I LOVED.  Then while out of the country, in Panama, I had the same treatment, for $60.00.  Back home in the US, I cannot afford to keep up my new addiction of salon keratin treatments, so I decided to try the two step Aphogee treatment for $4.00.  I purchased the little packets, just wanting to try it.  I followed all the instructions left in the reviews, along with the packet instructions (which I found to be very clear).  My hair feels as good as the salon treatments.  I have blonde hair - from a bottle, it was feeling over processed.  It turned out wonderful, I highly recommend this.  As one reviewer said, this is the stuff the professionals use, it definitely feels like a pro job.  Enjoy your new hair!</li>
    <li> My hair really lacked of protein because of excessive heat and coloring. I immediately felt the extra strength after I rinced it. It is not the easiest thing to apply, and I would advise to wear gloves if you have any scratch on your hands because it can burn. The smell is not nice, but not horrible, and it doesn&#x27;t stay on the hair after it is rinsed and conditioned. I don&#x27;t use the aphogee conditioner after that, but my regular deep conditioner from shea moisture, and it works just fine. I have to apply it every 2 months because my hair get mushy again after a while.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  It stinks to high heaven but it works.  It&#x27;s great for really, really damaged hair or hair with breakage.  You have to do the two steps because the protein alone can dry hair out so the second step, the moisturizer, is absolutely crucial.  This is available at Sally Beauty Supply, btw.  When I was bleaching my medium brown hair, this treatment restored my hair to health.  I use it less frequently now that I&#x27;m no longer doing that, but it&#x27;s still in my cabinet and I will use it when my hair needs it.  I&#x27;d advise doing this treatment before coloring, since it can change the color a bit. If you&#x27;re hair is brittle and dry, then this would likely worsen that condition.  I suggest instead replacing the hair&#x27;s lipids (oils).  Apply argan oil at night to the midlengths and ends, a generous amount but not too much.  Then sleep on it and wash it in the AM.  I recommend a cleansing conditioner instead of shampoo (works the best and any lightweight conditioner will work).  Do this several times.  Argan is a dry oil and is easily absorbed without greasiness.  You may find that in the morning, your hair doesn&#x27;t need to be washed at all. If this doesn&#x27;t restore the elasticity and softness, try coconut oil, which is heavier.  Do the same procedure except add heat before you go to bed.  This opens the cuticle so the oil can penetrate.  You can do the same with the argan oil (except those with fine hair).  If you&#x27;ve been coloring your hair like a madwoman, then the Apoghee treatment will work wonders, just do it before coloring since it will fade the color somewhat.  Afterwards, use Kanechom shea butter formula with heat and your hair will be super shiny. I highly recommend this treatment.  It is a well kept secret of those who have beautiful hair, especially those who are bleaching the hell out of it, lol!  You can buy this product at Sally Beauty Supply for a lot less money, btw.</li>
    <li> Very upset!! My beautiful healthy hair was destroyed. My hair is falling out and feels like straw!! I had finally gotten it healthy and cut off the last dead ends!! I did the treatment as an extra measure to keep it healthy. I never saw this as a possibility. My hair was very healthy. Really sad about it :(</li>
    <li> Aphogee protein treatment is the best solution to strengthen your hair, love the product.  Received the product with no issues, thanks GMBSHair.</li>
    <li> All the aphogee products are amazing my hair is healthy strong and silky I would recommend</li>
    <li> I have fine, medium-density fragile 4a hair. I was combating dryness and breakage and was looking for something that would turn my hair around. I kept hearing about Aphogee. I saw tutorials of people using it on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I didn&#x27;t have the hair I had hoped for after using Aphogee. This product broke my hair off horribly! As other reviewers have already posted, I followed the directions and used a deep conditioner after I used the Aphogee. My hair felt like hay when it dried, the ends were frazzled and hair kept coming out - just what I was trying to avoid! No amount of product brought my hair back to normal. It took two weeks for my hair to feel normal again. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. So many people extol the virtues of this product. I wanted it to work, I really did. But it didn&#x27;t. Maybe my hair is protein sensitive. In any case, I&#x27;d sell this bottle for a penny. That&#x27;s how annoyed I am.</li>
    <li> This is an extremely effective strengthener for weak hair, suffering breakage. The effect will last a month or more, depending on what you do to your hair after. I noticed a warning here about hair that needs elasticity needing a moisturizer vs a protein....When you do this &amp;#34; Two-Step&amp;#34; you ALWAYS follow with the  Aphogee  moisturizer. The protein goes on first, alone, to bond weak spots better.</li>
    <li> Today August 30th, 2014 I used the aphogee two step with the balancing moisturizer. I must say I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I colored my hair two months ago and my started getting damage. After my first time using this product my hair was strong, to see if my hair was strong after one use I did a strand test and when I pulled my strand it was strong. Its worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> What Aphogee Two-Step Protein Treatment for Damaged Hair has done is to create and maintain a product that does exactly what it says it will do. Repair your hair damage from the outside-in. This truly is the basis for the salon-standard that costs much more, btw, but is no less effective in treatment. This is a wonderful industrial-grade, industry standard product that will work for all hair types. A+</li>
    <li> The smell is so bad, worse than rotten food! Does leave hair soft! I won&#x27;t buy again due to the smell.</li>
    <li> This is a nuisance to apply and afterwards I did not notice much of a difference in my hair quality.</li>
    <li> I received the Two Minute Reconstructor...which is not the same product at all.  Very disappointed because I have used the Two Step Treatment and love it.</li>
</ol>
