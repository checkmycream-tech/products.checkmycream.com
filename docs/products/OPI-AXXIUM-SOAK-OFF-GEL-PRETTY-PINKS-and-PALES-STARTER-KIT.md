<ol>
      <li>EOS was great to work with!  </li>
      <li>I had this done at a very good salon in Ormond Beach, Fl, called Emerald Nails, 12 days ago</li>
      <li>The product is very good</li>
      <li>But the vendor was not that great...</li>
      <li>Great starter kit.</li>
      <li>In theory, this is a great idea</li>
      <li>this is a great set.  </li>
      <li>This was a wonderful buy and a great way to get started doing your own soak off gel nails at home.</li>
      <li>But if you know what you are doing, then it might be good for you.</li>
      <li>and it looks as good as the day they did it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been wanting my own anyway,so I bought one</li>
      <li>The kit is complete and inside you can find all the things you need for a perfect manicure.</li>
      <li>Decided with the recession, I would curb my spending without sacrificing love for nice looking nails.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll be pleased with a nice 10 day to 2 week manicure that lasts through all of the working mom punishment</li>
      <li>Ironically, I&#x27;ve had better results doing it on my own than at the salon.  </li>
      <li>Also, all the the colors are very, very light.</li>
      <li>But they are perfect if you like sheer feminine colors as I do.</li>
      <li>I love OPI, but not in love with this set.</li>
      <li>I bought some gel colors from Gelish that I love</li>
      <li>I get soo many compliments.</li>
      <li>Purchased this item as apart of my gel nail supply list (UV lamp, Axxium gel starter kit, Shellac Top Coat).</li>
      <li>Although it was refunded, the sealer is so important, so I have to buy it somewhere else, which costed me a lot more than what it has been refunded for.</li>
      <li>Shiniest, most fabulous manicure I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>the instructional DVD makes it super easy to learn!</li>
      <li>this product is great for long lasting strong nails with great shine!</li>
      <li>ps I bought a pretty cheap UV light from ebay that is higher wattage and works great.</li>
      <li>Once I get the hang of it, it should work fine.</li>
      <li>The product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I had it done at a salon, but will buy a uv light when I can find one in my price range and do them myself.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Overall a good starter kit.</li>
      <li>Get a UV lamp that is strong enough (42W ), be frugal, and have fun ; )  Love this product.</li>
      <li>Right now, it lasts about 10 days before it starts to peel.</li>
      <li>I took off my Shellac and got right to work on my nails.</li>
      <li>At this point, they are very limited on colors, but I&#x27;m so happy with the results, that I can live with that.</li>
      <li>Stregthens my nails and color looks great after even a week or 10 days, and I have 2 small kids.</li>
      <li>I had this gel polish applied because my son was getting married</li>
      <li>The colors are really pretty.  </li>
      <li>I used this exactly as directed.  </li>
      <li>I love the shine that the final gel coating gives.</li>
      <li>I love it as I do transcription so my nails are constantly being tapped on by the keyboard</li>
      <li>I had followed the directions what I think was exactly, so</li>
      <li>the rest are almost clear and you would have to apply many, many coats for them to look pink on your nails.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s going to take me a little practice to get it perfect but not much.</li>
      <li>I should have started with something more basic and I regret spending so much money.  </li>
      <li>Pink colors are gorgeous, natural looking.</li>
      <li>The almost darkest color is barely pink on my fingers, which is fine but something to be aware of (it&#x27;s very pretty).     </li>
      <li>Would have liked the colors to be a little darker.</li>
      <li>I really like this gel polish, because it is a polish (not gel nails).  </li>
      <li>Very convenient.</li>
      <li>and I am always ready to go out for the evening.</li>
      <li>This is a great alternative for people like me who can&#x27;t use acrylic or gel nails because they make my job difficult.</li>
      <li>but this was easy, I think its easier than regular polish actually.</li>
      <li>I love the look of this manicure, lasts at least two weeks, shiny the whole time.  </li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t say that all of these colors come in little jars and are applied with a small brush (kind of like a lip color brush) that you have to clean after using each gel.</li>
      <li>Also be aware that after the last coat (the gel sealer)</li>
      <li>I tried all of them once or twice, exactly per the instructions, and the colors were all fully transparent, with only the tiniest tint of color to it.</li>
      <li>I actually did a better job than the nail tech who did them (less lumps).     </li>
      <li>and it came right off and was completely shiny and dry.     </li>
      <li>So far, it&#x27;s been 5 days and no chipping.</li>
      <li>I love this product except that the gel is so thick.</li>
      <li>Thin, even coats, under new UV light for triple the suggested time, still are soft and rubbery with no shine.  </li>
      <li>I even tried putting my hands back under the uv dryer longer for 5 mins and still it was sticky and the shine was completely gone.</li>
      <li>Nail polish would start chipping by the next day on my natural nails.</li>
      <li>I tried that with only little success.  </li>
      <li>and you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem), and the whole thing (with dry time) took less than a normal manicure.</li>

<li> After getting this kit and watching the DVD I realized why: the first time the nail tech didn&#x27;t prep my nails properly and both times the tech used the top coat as base coat.  </li>
<li> One thing to be aware of is when they say \\&quot;pale\\&quot; they mean it.</li>
<li> There is only one color that is really pink</li>
<li> This takes a long time to learn.  </li>
<li> It was easy to put on (just like thick nailpolish, go slow</li>
<li> until you do it will feel gummy and like your nails didn&#x27;t get dry.</li>
<li> I did find the colors all too similar, but that would be my only complaint.</li>
<li> Then I soaked directly in acetone, per the instructions, for at least another 15 minutes.  </li>
<li> The &amp;#34;Sealer&amp;#34; bottle was completely empty.</li>
<li> I picked the color pink.  </li>
<li> a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> and now I take it to my salon with me (along with all of my other stuff)</li>
<li> I am on a budget and have purchased a set kit and UV 36 amp lite from Amazon, due to arrive this week</li>
<li> and actually I can&#x27;t give the kit a 2 star, but it is really difficult to use and to do yourself unless you are a professional.</li>
<li> I had peeling on day 2 after first having it done at a salon then had a bad soak-off experience the second time.  </li>
<li> and I use the base and top coat from this.</li>
<li> Much less downtime because once it&#x27;s finished you don&#x27;t have to wait around forever.   </li>
<li> I&#x27;d spent the past year paying $45 for a gel mani and pedi.</li>
<li> This is a waste of money and I would never purchase the gel polish by this company.</li>
<li> I consider myself an amateur, but thought I could handle this.</li>
<li> The colors are very pale.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve read some negative reviews about the kit, but the trick is ladies...</li>
<li> I just about freaked out (duh)</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;ve peeled them off rather than soaking off, but this was because I put it on too thick and it started to lift.</li>
<li> I am not sure if I am doing it wrong, but it peels.</li>
<li> one of the products had the seal broken.</li>
<li> My brittle nails haven&#x27;t broken at all, either.</li>
<li> Sorry Sarah.</li>
<li> to impossible to do it on yourself and takes forever.</li>
<li> bad.</li>
<li> bad.</li>
<li> Disappointed after spending $$.</li>
<li> Very disappointed, and I don&#x27;t ever use them anymore.</li>
<li> it was very annoying</li>

    <li> Once I get the hang of it, it should work fine. Right now, it lasts about 10 days before it starts to peel. The colors are lighter than they appear on the cover.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> I bought my on Amazon and the vendor was rock&amp;glamorize... The product is very good and i dont think i will go back to the traditional manicure ever! But the vendor was not that great... one of the products had the seal broken. I notified the vendor but they even bother to contact me... it was very annoying</li>
    <li> I really like this gel polish, because it is a polish (not gel nails).  Pink colors are gorgeous, natural looking. I love the shine that the final gel coating gives. I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;ve peeled them off rather than soaking off, but this was because I put it on too thick and it started to lift. Stregthens my nails and color looks great after even a week or 10 days, and I have 2 small kids. My hands are constantly in water. You should try this kit, it has everything you need except the UV nail dryer, which is required. I&#x27;d been wanting my own anyway,so I bought one and now I take it to my salon with me (along with all of my other stuff) so that I don&#x27;t have to use theirs. When I don&#x27;t have time to go the the salon, I do it myself at home. Very convenient.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative for people like me who can&#x27;t use acrylic or gel nails because they make my job difficult. Nail polish would start chipping by the next day on my natural nails. I had this gel polish applied because my son was getting married and I wanted something to last through the weekend. So far, it&#x27;s been 5 days and no chipping. My brittle nails haven&#x27;t broken at all, either. I had it done at a salon, but will buy a uv light when I can find one in my price range and do them myself. At this point, they are very limited on colors, but I&#x27;m so happy with the results, that I can live with that. The manicurist told me that to remove the gel, she puts nail polish remover on a cotton ball, puts it on the nail, wraps in foil, and waits 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> I got this today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. I took off my Shellac and got right to work on my nails. I have never done a gel polish my self but this was easy, I think its easier than regular polish actually. All of these colors are very sheer so don&#x27;t let the box mislead you. But they are perfect if you like sheer feminine colors as I do.</li>
    <li> I used this exactly as directed.  Thin, even coats, under new UV light for triple the suggested time, still are soft and rubbery with no shine.  Disappointed after spending $$.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone, I watched the dvd put this product on my nails just like the dvd instructed me to do and it was sticky. I even tried putting my hands back under the uv dryer longer for 5 mins and still it was sticky and the shine was completely gone. This is a waste of money and I would never purchase the gel polish by this company.</li>
    <li> This was a wonderful buy and a great way to get started doing your own soak off gel nails at home. I did find the colors all too similar, but that would be my only complaint.</li>
    <li> I had this done at a very good salon in Ormond Beach, Fl, called Emerald Nails, 12 days ago and it looks as good as the day they did it. I picked the color pink.  I am on a budget and have purchased a set kit and UV 36 amp lite from Amazon, due to arrive this week, I will update you on how well it works at home. I love it as I do transcription so my nails are constantly being tapped on by the keyboard and I am always ready to go out for the evening.</li>
    <li> I had Axium gel polish done twice at a salon then decided to save some $$ and learn to do it myself.  Ironically, I&#x27;ve had better results doing it on my own than at the salon.  I had peeling on day 2 after first having it done at a salon then had a bad soak-off experience the second time.  After getting this kit and watching the DVD I realized why: the first time the nail tech didn&#x27;t prep my nails properly and both times the tech used the top coat as base coat.  If you follow the instructions in the DVD and use the products recommended (including OPI Expert Touch Lacquer Remover to soak off) you&#x27;ll be pleased with a nice 10 day to 2 week manicure that lasts through all of the working mom punishment you can give it.  It&#x27;s going to take me a little practice to get it perfect but not much.</li>
    <li> I love the look of this manicure, lasts at least two weeks, shiny the whole time.  The problem is getting it off.  When you get a gel manicure at the salon they only soak it off with cotton balls wrapped in foil for about 15 minutes.  I tried that with only little success.  Then I soaked directly in acetone, per the instructions, for at least another 15 minutes.  Still big chunks didn&#x27;t come off.  I had followed the directions what I think was exactly, so I don&#x27;t believe the problem was that.  I ended up peeling some off which hurt my nails and now you can see the dips in them.  I may just stick with the salon gel manicure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d spent the past year paying $45 for a gel mani and pedi. Decided with the recession, I would curb my spending without sacrificing love for nice looking nails. Purchased this item as apart of my gel nail supply list (UV lamp, Axxium gel starter kit, Shellac Top Coat). Shiniest, most fabulous manicure I&#x27;ve ever had. I get soo many compliments. I&#x27;ve read some negative reviews about the kit, but the trick is ladies...a little goes a long way. Get a UV lamp that is strong enough (42W ), be frugal, and have fun ; )  Love this product. I&#x27;ve officially fired my manicurist. Sorry Sarah.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of months ago and was scared to try it. I had it done at a salon and it cost me 30 bucks. I watched her do it and thought hm I can do this.     last night I got the guts to try it out. It was easy to put on (just like thick nailpolish, go slow and you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem), and the whole thing (with dry time) took less than a normal manicure. Much less downtime because once it&#x27;s finished you don&#x27;t have to wait around forever.   I actually did a better job than the nail tech who did them (less lumps).     One thing to be aware of is when they say \\&quot;pale\\&quot; they mean it. The almost darkest color is barely pink on my fingers, which is fine but something to be aware of (it&#x27;s very pretty).     Also be aware that after the last coat (the gel sealer) you DO have to use the cleaner spray...until you do it will feel gummy and like your nails didn&#x27;t get dry. I just about freaked out (duh) but then re-read the instructions and used the spray and it came right off and was completely shiny and dry.     Also do not peel this off!! bad. bad. bad!!! it will pull off part of your nail.     ps I bought a pretty cheap UV light from ebay that is higher wattage and works great.</li>
    <li> I love this product except that the gel is so thick. I bought some gel colors from Gelish that I love and I use the base and top coat from this. Also, all the the colors are very, very light. There is only one color that is really pink the rest are almost clear and you would have to apply many, many coats for them to look pink on your nails. It also doesn&#x27;t say that all of these colors come in little jars and are applied with a small brush (kind of like a lip color brush) that you have to clean after using each gel. Overall a good starter kit.</li>
    <li> The colors are very pale. I love OPI, but not in love with this set. I am not sure if I am doing it wrong, but it peels.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Sealer&amp;#34; bottle was completely empty. Although it was refunded, the sealer is so important, so I have to buy it somewhere else, which costed me a lot more than what it has been refunded for.</li>
    <li> this is a great set.  The colors are really pretty.  EOS was great to work with!  They were prompt at getting my items out and corresponding on the email!</li>
    <li> In theory, this is a great idea and actually I can&#x27;t give the kit a 2 star, but it is really difficult to use and to do yourself unless you are a professional. I consider myself an amateur, but thought I could handle this. I maybe used it twice before giving it away to my friend&#x27;s daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Next to impossible to do it on yourself and takes forever.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the machine I used to cure the gel, but none of the colors turned out as they were supposed to. I tried all of them once or twice, exactly per the instructions, and the colors were all fully transparent, with only the tiniest tint of color to it. It would also chip within a day or two, max. Very disappointed, and I don&#x27;t ever use them anymore.</li>
    <li> This takes a long time to learn.  I should have started with something more basic and I regret spending so much money.  But if you know what you are doing, then it might be good for you.</li>
    <li> The product is fantastic. The kit is complete and inside you can find all the things you need for a perfect manicure.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. Great starter kit. Would have liked the colors to be a little darker.</li>
    <li> this product is great for long lasting strong nails with great shine! the instructional DVD makes it super easy to learn!</li>
