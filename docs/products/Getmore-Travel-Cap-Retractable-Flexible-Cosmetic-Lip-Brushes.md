      <li>and it&#x27;s very smooth.  </li>
      <li>These disposable applicators are so easy and effective to you when applying lip colors/glosses on clients.</li>
      <li>Always love these brushes</li>
      <li>I use them for gel eye liner and love them.</li>
      <li>I need some more I am out.</li>
      <li>I need some more.</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more for upcoming prom and wedding season.</li>
      <li>Can a man say more than that about a product?  </li>
      <li>Sometimes I get a lip product that I don&#x27;t like, but most people won&#x27;t swap for a product that had been used because of concerns over unsanitary practices.</li>
      <li>what more can you ask for?</li>
      <li>Received these and am extremely satisfied...</li>
      <li>Oh my goodness, I need some more of these Lip Brushes.</li>
      <li>That is good enough for me to give them a good rating.</li>
      <li>Great price and super fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Keep your lip gloss colors true and the tubes more hygienic with these disposable lip brushes.  </li>
      <li>Works just fine...</li>
      <li>These are wonderful little accessories to have for customers to sample my Lipglosses.</li>
      <li>Equally good for digging out that last bit of your favorite lipstick and applying  it to your lips.</li>
      <li>Very economically priced as well.</li>
      <li>Love being able to apply lipstick on my clients and dispose of them right away instead of having a lip brush to clean right after each client.</li>
      <li>My clients live not worrying about germs and using their own lip wand then discard after each sample.</li>
      <li>I use then to clean guns.</li>
      <li>Just what I really needed for my make up business :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s looks professional, it&#x27;s sanitary, and I&#x27;m able to precisely apply lipstick and lip gloss.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>This is the 2nd time I have ordered and I love them!</li>
      <li>She found that these work well for her business and are economical.</li>
      <li>The length is just right and the package can be opened so that each wand is pristine when removed.</li>
      <li>It is also great to apply under eye concealer or concealer on small blemishes.</li>
      <li>By using these to test a new product, I am able to try new lip products without contamination.</li>
      <li>Exactly what it is supposed to be.</li>
      <li>(Found that out when I ran out of Latisse brushes haha!)</li>
      <li>These were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I will likely be purchasing more once I run out.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>These wands work well for my Lip Messages business - Lipsology - the art and science of lip print reading - where folks who have never used a lip brush are trying them for the first time.</li>
      <li>I tend to use things until they fall apart, and I am still on my first applicator after about 3 weeks of using it.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had an issue with these as far as durability goes, but I will mention that the tip is SUPER absorbent.  </li>
      <li>I am a makeup artist, and purchased these to leave with clients so they could apply a lip touchup later in the day, but since this tip absorbs SO MUCH product, I have to leave much more than I normally would, and that costs me money.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I’m a professional face painter and use these to apply ipstick - they work much better than q-tips which is the industry standard for applying color to the lips.</li>
      <li>Also I don&#x27;t necessarily like to break out the big eye shadow brushes; these are more compact and portable.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend getting these.</li>
      <li>so she&#x27;s always looking for new products to try for her customers.</li>
      <li>Love these little disposable lip brushes!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist, and I use these on my clients.  </li>
      <li>The tips are soft and durable and applies lipstick and gloss well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought these because I wanted something that would allow me to try out new lip products before actually using them. I am part of a makeup subscripton service and am involved in a few &amp;#34;swap&amp;#34; groups on Facebook. Sometimes I get a lip product that I don&#x27;t like, but most people won&#x27;t swap for a product that had been used because of concerns over unsanitary practices. By using these to test a new product, I am able to try new lip products without contamination. These also work well for make up artists, who use the same products with different clients.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it is supposed to be.</li>
    <li> These are great for sampling lipsticks and lipsticks. My clients live not worrying about germs and using their own lip wand then discard after each sample. A must for beauty experts and artists</li>
    <li> These are great applicators.  Before I was using a trimmed down plastic knife to apply my lipstick and I couldn&#x27;t get the correct type of application.  These applicators are perfect - you can outline your lips easily and it&#x27;s very smooth.  I tend to use things until they fall apart, and I am still on my first applicator after about 3 weeks of using it.  At this rate it will probably take me YEARS to use them all up.  I noticed that the 500 pack of applicators was alot more expensive than just buying 5 packs of 100 applicators each.  Takes a little while to get them, but it&#x27;s worth the wait when you see the quality that the applicators are and notice how long each one will last.  If you don&#x27;t use one applicator per application of lipstick, they should last you a long while too.  I highly recommend getting these.</li>
    <li> Such a lifesaver! These disposable applicators are so easy and effective to you when applying lip colors/glosses on clients. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Work perfect for lip gloss testers</li>
    <li> Perfect for sampling of my skincare products. Classy.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t needed to use these yet (thank goodness). I bought them so I can still use my lipgloss when I have a cold sore. They seem sturdy enough.</li>
    <li> Should have bought 2 packs. Packaging could have been better but they are nice.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness, I need some more of these Lip Brushes. My niece turned me on to Lip brushes; she&#x27;s a beauty enthusiast. I am so happy that I watched her put on her makeup. I need some more I am out. When did I buy these two years ago. I need some more.</li>
    <li> Perfect brush for my clients to test my lip glosses!  This is the 2nd time I have ordered and I love them!</li>
    <li> Nice brushes for disposable</li>
    <li> Good product great for my lip stick and lip glos. Will order agagain . this is my second order. Thanks</li>
    <li> Keep your lip gloss colors true and the tubes more hygienic with these disposable lip brushes.  Really good quality, too.</li>
    <li> Affordable, and work just as needed!</li>
    <li> excellent quality ! take a few weeks to get them :(</li>
    <li> These wands are great.  I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist, and I use these on my clients.  It&#x27;s looks professional, it&#x27;s sanitary, and I&#x27;m able to precisely apply lipstick and lip gloss.</li>
    <li> Good quality, did the job.</li>
    <li> They are just as described and came when expected</li>
    <li> great for what I need them for</li>
    <li> Can a man say more than that about a product?  She likes them.  That is good enough for me to give them a good rating.</li>
    <li> Works just fine...i will be ordering.</li>
    <li> They work great. Perfect for testing out lip gloss and lip stains</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for a budding young make-up artist.  The length is just right and the package can be opened so that each wand is pristine when removed.</li>
    <li> I had previously posted a rating stating i havent received... Im so sorry it was for another item intended... Received these and am extremely satisfied... Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused. Thank You</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I was looking for, and it was the best price I could find on the internet.</li>
    <li> I use these for my business, during makeup applications. I love them! And they&#x27;re inexpensive too!</li>
    <li> love it just what i was looking for!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Pefect for lip gloss or lipstick applications on my clients</li>
    <li> I’m a professional face painter and use these to apply ipstick - they work much better than q-tips which is the industry standard for applying color to the lips. Affordable and work well - what more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Just what I really needed for my make up business :)</li>
    <li> I use them for gel eye liner and love them.</li>
    <li> Great for making samples to give out to people.  Perfect for lipgloss or lipnstain application</li>
    <li> Great ! Will repurchase again</li>
    <li> They do what they are ment for. When I do home parties for Younique Cosmetics and skin care they are in my case.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful little accessories to have for customers to sample my Lipglosses. Love them! Thank you!</li>
    <li> work great to keep sanitary</li>
    <li> Thank you the item is great!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Received sooner than anticipated.</li>
    <li> Fuzzy lip applicators on little tube wands. Just like the ones at Sephora.</li>
    <li> My wife is a cosmetologist so she&#x27;s always looking for new products to try for her customers. She found that these work well for her business and are economical.</li>
    <li> Great addition to my make up kit.</li>
    <li> Great disposable flocked applicators!!! Very economically priced as well.</li>
    <li> These are inexpensive makeup applicators! Great for makeup sampling and applying Latisse! (Found that out when I ran out of Latisse brushes haha!)</li>
    <li> jus basic makeup wands. .  good .!</li>
    <li> Got on time great for wife to use and throw away</li>
    <li> Wonderful for lipstick, lip gloss, and even filling in eyebrows! As a makeup artist i have not been able to find better quality at that pricing!</li>
    <li> Very nice and much more affordable than buying from a cosmetics store. I will likely be purchasing more once I run out. I use these regularly in my makeup kit.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to replenish my makeup kit. Good quality and price. Will be ordering more for upcoming prom and wedding season.</li>
    <li> I cant leave without those one my kit great pricing very fast shipment</li>
    <li> Delivered faster than expected.  Good quality.  Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Nice that they were what I would expect. Using them for eyelash extensions for lash cleaning.</li>
    <li> I would buy these little disposable makeup spatulas again. If you don&#x27;t want to ante up for a more expensive reusable option like the Spatty Daddy, this product will accomplish the same thing, although the handles aren&#x27;t quite as long as the Spatty Daddy. I had no problem digging into the bottom of my Revlon Age Defying foundation container to get the last drop of makeup, and then there&#x27;s no clean-up - just toss the little spatula into the trash. Equally good for digging out that last bit of your favorite lipstick and applying  it to your lips. Perfectly usable and I&#x27;d buy them again!</li>
    <li> Just what i needed and great deal</li>
    <li> Very happy with product</li>
    <li> These work really great!  Great Price!</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I was looking for. Shipping was a bit longer than expected but product was Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had an issue with these as far as durability goes, but I will mention that the tip is SUPER absorbent.  I am a makeup artist, and purchased these to leave with clients so they could apply a lip touchup later in the day, but since this tip absorbs SO MUCH product, I have to leave much more than I normally would, and that costs me money.  I probably will not use the rest of this package, and I will try to order something a little higher quality.</li>
    <li> Too absorbent for Latisse.</li>
    <li> They work! Took a long while to get here, as expected. Great to have in any makeup artist kit.</li>
    <li> im happy with the lip wands, they will be perfect for working on my clients. very happy with the product</li>
    <li> These are a must-have for me because for one the brushes that come with compacts are always bad. Also I don&#x27;t necessarily like to break out the big eye shadow brushes; these are more compact and portable.</li>
    <li> Love how these are! Perfect for what I needed them for!</li>
    <li> Great product for any make up case perfect shipping and well-made</li>
    <li> The tips are soft and durable and applies lipstick and gloss well. I will be ordering them again.</li>
    <li> Love being able to apply lipstick on my clients and dispose of them right away instead of having a lip brush to clean right after each client. So convenient. MUA must have!</li>
    <li> Great price and super fast shipping! Love these little disposable lip brushes! Just like the ones at sephora!</li>
    <li> These wands work well for my Lip Messages business - Lipsology - the art and science of lip print reading - where folks who have never used a lip brush are trying them for the first time.</li>
    <li> Second order of these. I use then to clean guns. They get to places q-tips can&#x60;t plus they don&#x60;t leave lint!! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Came faster than I thought.  Always love these brushes</li>
    <li> Wonderful for customers lip product sampling.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does what it is supposed to. It is also great to apply under eye concealer or concealer on small blemishes. Its a definite must have for makeup artists</li>
    <li> These are awesome to use to apply super pigmented lipstick and get it in the right spots on your lip and not all smeared around like it happens if I just use the lipstick. Shipping is kinda slow, but I just ordered 2 x100 so that even when I have to wait for the next shipment I&#x27;ll have lots to last me.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my theatre; with 10-15 girls doing their make-up at once (not counting back-ups and understudies) one does worry about the spread of bacteria. Thankfully, I found these and ordered ten sets- they are the perfect size and are disposable after one use. The ebst part: we can even use them as powder (eyeshadow, concealer, talcum) applicators in a pinch!</li>
