### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This stuff is perfect!</li>
      <li>Now she&#x27;s happy and when she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
      <li>Perfect bronzer for fair skin.</li>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>Really good bronzer.  </li>
      <li>I so her skin is incredibly fair.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin w/ freckles and a bit of color because it&#x27;s July</li>
      <li>I sifted through their list until I found this one that folks said worked for fair skin.  </li>
      <li>Good price too.</li>
      <li>Good color</li>
      <li>Best of all, this stuff is CHEAP</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years, love it, price is great, lasts forever and applies well for all over color.</li>
      <li>Nice matte bronzer for fair skin, but</li>
      <li>I googled &amp;#34;best bronzer for fair skin&amp;#34; and saw an article that talked about the top 20 bronzers.  </li>
      <li>Finally found a great bronzer for pale/fair skin!</li>
      <li>Love how it looks and glad it has no shimmers in it.</li>
      <li>Love it....</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love.</li>
      <li>Perfect shade and lasting coverage.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I can also apply more to my face if I feel like contouring.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pretty good product - can beat the price.  </li>
      <li>This is a fine product</li>
      <li>She has used bronzers before that were light and didn&#x27;t give her the appearance of dirt on her face--this was not of those bronzers.</li>
      <li>Have used this maybe ididnt like it with my skintone (light skinned)</li>
      <li>This bronzer is looking to be a keeper because on my beige skin it applies well and its cheap.  </li>
      <li>Not only is it a beautiful color on me (not too orangey), but it is very pigmented (no need to use a lot!).  </li>
      <li>More then anything it brings a truly natural color and glow to my skin that I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve before.</li>
      <li>Waterproof and perfect subtle color.</li>
      <li>This product is super blendable, and not too pigmented.</li>
      <li>For starters I have fair to medium skin with pink undertones</li>
      <li>just enough color over my make up to make me look like I have a nice tan.  </li>
      <li>This is the only kind I have found that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Good for people with pale skin if applied lightly.</li>
      <li>OKAY product overall</li>
      <li>I love how this bronzer brightens my face with a sheer sun-kissed glow (and doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;m wearing anything or turn me orange).</li>
      <li>I can use it over any type of foundation and it never fails.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for contouring and will last me for a very long time.</li>
      <li>Until I received this product, I was using a dusky peach blush as a bronzer...which didn&#x27;t work as well because it wasn&#x27;t very pigmented.  </li>
      <li>I really like this bronzer.  </li>
      <li>I really adore this product.</li>
      <li>&amp; tha shade compliments my fair/beige skin tone very well.</li>
      <li>It is an absolute matte bronzer with no shimmer or any orange/red under tones.</li>
      <li>In the end though, I&#x27;ll probably have this bronzer forever, because I don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>as soon as I use about half of the product it seems to break very easily and crumble apart.</li>
      <li>This bronzer is not shimmery, not thick, not orange and it blends quite well.</li>
      <li>Very natural looking color.</li>
      <li>Glad i did: no more having to spend oodles of money for NARS; this is now my new bronzer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Additionally, this product is waterproof (thank goodness, because I sweat a lot!) and has additional SPF in the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an affordable product that is easy to apply/blend and works well on pale skin without looking unnatural.</li>
      <li>This is very hard to find and I was THRILLED to find it here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It also does not bother my sensitive skin at all.</li>
      <li>I like this Rimmel Natural Bronzer for the price point</li>
      <li>As the label says, it is a NATURAL bronzer.</li>
      <li>This evened out my skin tone by blending freckles and looks completely natural.</li>
      <li>When I put this on I instantly fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this for pale skin.</li>
      <li>Typically, facial products cause my sensitive skin to break out, but it is not the case for me with this bronzer.</li>
      <li>(i.e., sometimes make-up companies&#x27; lightest foundation colors are still too dark for me) and so finding a bronzer that doesn&#x27;t look orange was a real problem.  </li>

<li> My wife was having a hard time finding this locally, so told her I could get it fast on Amazon</li>
<li> It looks really natural on me and I am extremely pale.</li>
<li> I was looking for a bronzer that would look natural on pale skin.</li>
<li> I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re very pale.</li>
<li> I do not like to spend a lot on make up because I am still somewhat new to the world of makeup and am not sure what to expect from all these deifferent products.  </li>
<li> I have an atom amt left and have had to buy other bronzers in desparation.</li>
<li> The lid was cracked when I opened the package and the makeup was loose and had fallen out into the packaging.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really hard for me to find a bronzer that looks natural on me.</li>
<li> Does the job for not much $.</li>
<li> Since I am adverse to excessive sun exposure, I frequently have a pale look to my skin.</li>
<li> Ran out of my NARS bronzer &amp; I like some other Rimmel items so thought i&#x27;d give it a go.</li>
<li> I only pick up a small amount on a angled kabuki brush and blend it into oblivion.</li>
<li> So if you&#x27;re into extreme contouring, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
<li> I am very pale and I use it for just a tiny dash of color.  </li>
<li> I would only recommend this product for people with at least skin type II if not type III.</li>
<li> However, if you&#x27;re a regular person like me who wishes to amp up their cheekbones in a less dramatic way, this is definitely the product for you.</li>
<li> I wanted it slightly darker pigmented.</li>
<li> It has a slight shimmer to it as well in order to give your face a glowing appearance.</li>
<li> Then I seem to dump the rest of the bronzer in the garbage as it starts to break because I want to avoid the mess.</li>
<li> I stored mine in the medicine cabinet to avoid messy fallout.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve got extremely pale skin</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t ventured into the land of bronzers thinking that they would look weird on my shade of pale ala freckled red head.</li>
<li> As a guy, it&#x27;s hard to find a bronzer that isn&#x27;t stupid expensive or loaded with &amp;#34;shimmer,&amp;#34; so I am thrilled to find this product.</li>
<li> (I&#x27;m not sure why now, maybe a YouTube makeup tutorial suggested it)</li>
<li> No rashes, breakouts or excessive drying.</li>
<li> I have very pale skin.</li>
<li> I also have very pale skin and started using this bronzer in the sun dance shade.</li>
<li> It gives me a slight tan without looking orange or fake.</li>
<li> Looks like it was broken before shipping.</li>
<li> the product was broken when received</li>
<li> The product came broken into pieces.</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s very hard to find a Bronzer that works without making me look fake!</li>
<li> They all seem to have an orange cast that I hate.</li>
<li> She absolutely hated it.</li>
<li> Horrible.</li>

    <li> The lid was cracked when I opened the package and the makeup was loose and had fallen out into the packaging. Horrible.</li>

    <li> I really like this bronzer.  I do not like to spend a lot on make up because I am still somewhat new to the world of makeup and am not sure what to expect from all these deifferent products.  This bronzer is looking to be a keeper because on my beige skin it applies well and its cheap.  Win-win and check-check.</li>
    <li> I like this Rimmel Natural Bronzer for the price point but I have noticed after buying about 3 of these that as soon as I use about half of the product it seems to break very easily and crumble apart. Then I seem to dump the rest of the bronzer in the garbage as it starts to break because I want to avoid the mess. OKAY product overall</li>
    <li> The only makeup for me! Perfect shade and lasting coverage.</li>
    <li> Really good bronzer.  I will buy it again.  Good price too.</li>
    <li> Perfect bronzer for fair skin. I only pick up a small amount on a angled kabuki brush and blend it into oblivion.</li>
    <li> I really adore this product. As the label says, it is a NATURAL bronzer. So if you&#x27;re into extreme contouring, this isn&#x27;t for you. However, if you&#x27;re a regular person like me who wishes to amp up their cheekbones in a less dramatic way, this is definitely the product for you. This product is super blendable, and not too pigmented. It has a slight shimmer to it as well in order to give your face a glowing appearance. Typically, facial products cause my sensitive skin to break out, but it is not the case for me with this bronzer. I wear this as a daily part of my morning routine!</li>
    <li> The product came broken into pieces. The lid was cracked. Looks like it was broken before shipping. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any qualms with it. &amp; tha shade compliments my fair/beige skin tone very well.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product - can beat the price.  Nice matte bronzer for fair skin, but the product was broken when received</li>
    <li> Waterproof and perfect subtle color. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, love it, price is great, lasts forever and applies well for all over color.</li>
    <li> Good for people with pale skin if applied lightly. Love how it looks and glad it has no shimmers in it.</li>
    <li> Very natural looking color. I have fair skin w/ freckles and a bit of color because it&#x27;s July but I can never get quite tan. This evened out my skin tone by blending freckles and looks completely natural. The cake is a bit powdery. I stored mine in the medicine cabinet to avoid messy fallout.</li>
    <li> Have used this maybe ididnt like it with my skintone (light skinned) I wanted it slightly darker pigmented.</li>
    <li> I made a mistake - wanted a matte.  Good color but I don&#x27;t need the shine.  Will give to a friend.</li>
    <li> Works great but you can get this for about 2 bucks at walmart........</li>
    <li> I also have very pale skin and started using this bronzer in the sun dance shade. I absolutely love it. It gives me a slight tan without looking orange or fake.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t ventured into the land of bronzers thinking that they would look weird on my shade of pale ala freckled red head. So when I thought I might give bronzers a go (I&#x27;m not sure why now, maybe a YouTube makeup tutorial suggested it) I didn&#x27;t want to invest a lot on a potential mistake. In the end though, I&#x27;ll probably have this bronzer forever, because I don&#x27;t need much. Does the job for not much $.</li>
    <li> Love it....just enough color over my make up to make me look like I have a nice tan.  Use it daily now that it is summer.</li>
    <li> I looked around A LOT for a bronzer that would work for contouring.  I&#x27;ve got extremely pale skin (i.e., sometimes make-up companies&#x27; lightest foundation colors are still too dark for me) and so finding a bronzer that doesn&#x27;t look orange was a real problem.  Until I received this product, I was using a dusky peach blush as a bronzer...which didn&#x27;t work as well because it wasn&#x27;t very pigmented.  I googled &amp;#34;best bronzer for fair skin&amp;#34; and saw an article that talked about the top 20 bronzers.  I sifted through their list until I found this one that folks said worked for fair skin.  Not only is it a beautiful color on me (not too orangey), but it is very pigmented (no need to use a lot!).  Best of all, this stuff is CHEAP (you can spend $35 for a bronzer, but I&#x27;d prefer not to!).  Love, love, love.</li>
    <li> Ran out of my NARS bronzer &amp; I like some other Rimmel items so thought i&#x27;d give it a go. Glad i did: no more having to spend oodles of money for NARS; this is now my new bronzer.</li>
    <li> My wife was having a hard time finding this locally, so told her I could get it fast on Amazon and I did. Now she&#x27;s happy and when she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I wish I would have noticed that it was a Sun Bronzer &amp; that it gives a tan effect. Doesn&#x27;t last all day (note: I don&#x27;t use primer)</li>
    <li> For starters I have fair to medium skin with pink undertones so it&#x27;s very hard to find a Bronzer that works without making me look fake! This stuff is perfect! I can use it over any type of foundation and it never fails. More then anything it brings a truly natural color and glow to my skin that I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve before. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> As a guy, it&#x27;s hard to find a bronzer that isn&#x27;t stupid expensive or loaded with &amp;#34;shimmer,&amp;#34; so I am thrilled to find this product. Since I am adverse to excessive sun exposure, I frequently have a pale look to my skin. I love how this bronzer brightens my face with a sheer sun-kissed glow (and doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;m wearing anything or turn me orange). I can also apply more to my face if I feel like contouring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, this product is waterproof (thank goodness, because I sweat a lot!) and has additional SPF in the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an affordable product that is easy to apply/blend and works well on pale skin without looking unnatural.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my sister. She absolutely hated it. I was looking for a bronzer that would look natural on pale skin. My sister has skin type I so her skin is incredibly fair. She has used bronzers before that were light and didn&#x27;t give her the appearance of dirt on her face--this was not of those bronzers. I would only recommend this product for people with at least skin type II if not type III.</li>
    <li> Finally found a great bronzer for pale/fair skin! This product will definitely give you that sunkissed look if you&#x27;re like me, and you look like you haven&#x27;t been in the sun for days. It is an absolute matte bronzer with no shimmer or any orange/red under tones.</li>
    <li> I have very pale skin. It&#x27;s really hard for me to find a bronzer that looks natural on me. When I put this on I instantly fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this for pale skin.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product but I wish it would have come with an application brush. I would recommend it.</li>
