      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to order more colors from this collection</li>
      <li>I love the shade of orange, but it is glittery which i am not a fan of.</li>
      <li>I like it much better than \\&quot;Tiger</li>
      <li>The color is like the swatch on the screen with more sparkle.</li>
      <li>Does not look as it appears here,I had to apply too MANY coats of,it was more like dollar store polish:</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this color--great for summer.</li>
      <li>Orange cream dream is a really great, vibrant color.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even bother painting all my nails with this color since it was so light the picture shows a deeper orange</li>
      <li>and I was so excited to find this candy land</li>
      <li>My favorite color is orange, and my nail salon does not carry a large selection of shades of orange.  </li>
      <li>This is a true orange, melon.</li>
      <li>A great one to pair with other colors or use by itself.</li>
      <li>The bottle is a full size bottle; polish glides on v.s. polish from gelish mini bottles; color is right on-very summery</li>
      <li>A great orange with a slight shimmer.</li>
      <li>I wish I could post a pic, because I have dark skin and this color looks very nice on my nails.</li>
      <li>Color went on nicely, didn&#x27;t wrinkle at all, and stayed pretty well considering I am very rough on my hands :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so fun and just like its pictured.</li>
      <li>Its still pretty, but not  creamy orange.</li>
      <li>Pretty opaque creamy orange but not pastel.</li>
      <li>Pretty, sparkly, bright-ish color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little darker than it looks in pictures, but I love it!</li>
      <li>they continually come out with new and exciting colors</li>
      <li>but you need to be a strongly committed &#x27;orange&#x27; person to wear it regularly.</li>
      <li>, it was a very faded orange and did not look like the picture at all</li>
      <li>I used it as just tips and on the whole nail</li>
      <li>It is much more of a red orange with a tiny bit of shimmer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are totally differnt color and like neon type or super shimmery time of</li>
      <li>I may wear it occasionally in the summer time but will usually opt for a neon orange or a bright orange/red like &#x27;Tiger Blossom&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I love orange but still find it hard to wear this color unless it&#x27;s Halloween since it is such a unique shade of orange.</li>
      <li>plus it only need two coats to get the real color to show threw!</li>
      <li>My only word-to-the-wise is to pay close attention to the actual photographs of the real live polish on a real persons&#x27; hand.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t care for this color and have only worn it once.  </li>
      <li>and it was completely busted..</li>

<li> Blossom\\&quot; by Gelish, for those of you who have that color, which has more of a red base to it.</li>
<li> Reading some of the other reviews I guess I should&#x27;ve expected that though.</li>

<li> very disappointed.. ;( it came busted!!!</li>
<li> Smells awful</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love the shade of orange, but it is glittery which i am not a fan of. Smells awful but i think that all Harmony Gelish polishes smell that way</li>
    <li> I like this color but I have to apply 5 coats to get it to be solid instead of translucent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for pastel color gelish polishes and I was so excited to find this candy land line.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this orange cream dream and the yellow one ( Don&#x27;t be such a sourpuss).&lt;br /&gt;They are totally differnt color and like neon type or super shimmery time of polishes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use the orange one during the summer but the yellow will be in the box for a long time until I figure something out.&lt;br /&gt;My dear co-gelish lovers, don&#x27;t expect any pastel tone from this line.</li>
    <li> Pretty opaque creamy orange but not pastel. It has a bit of a shimmer to it so it is not a matt color. I took a picture of it with vegas nights and every color looks good or sometimes better with vegas nights. Be careful not to apply to thick, the candyland versions tend to wrinkle easier than the originals.</li>
    <li> I did not like this polish at all, it was a very faded orange and did not look like the picture at all I didn&#x27;t even bother painting all my nails with this color since it was so light the picture shows a deeper orange</li>
    <li> A great orange with a slight shimmer. Good coverage in 1-2 coats.  Great for summer or Halloween (or year around for me, I love orange)</li>
    <li> So I put 5 stars because the polish acts wonderfully as a gel polish, but the color shown is NOT the color it turns out to be. It is much more of a red orange with a tiny bit of shimmer. Its still pretty, but not  creamy orange.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t care for this color and have only worn it once.  It&#x27;s just too frosty for me.  Reading some of the other reviews I guess I should&#x27;ve expected that though.</li>
    <li> I love this color, it is a bit sparkly and the perfect shade of orange. Color went on nicely, didn&#x27;t wrinkle at all, and stayed pretty well considering I am very rough on my hands :)</li>
    <li> This is actually an appropriate name for the color. I love orange but still find it hard to wear this color unless it&#x27;s Halloween since it is such a unique shade of orange.

    <li> Does not look as it appears here,I had to apply too MANY coats of,it was more like dollar store polish:( wish I would&#x27;ve saved my $12!!!</li>
    <li> I love this color! It&#x27;s so fun and just like its pictured. I can&#x27;t wait to order more colors from this collection</li>
    <li> Gelish is my favorite gel nailpolish! they continually come out with new and exciting colors and I just love the product! My only word-to-the-wise is to pay close attention to the actual photographs of the real live polish on a real persons&#x27; hand. The color \\&quot;dot\\&quot; that is provided can sometimes be misleading and not the color you were expecting (e.g. I ordered a color that looked eggplant purple, but it was navy blue in fact).</li>
    <li> I wish I could post a pic, because I have dark skin and this color looks very nice on my nails. It&#x27;s a melon color, maybe just a tad darker than melon, but still in that color range. I like it much better than \\&quot;Tiger Blossom\\&quot; by Gelish, for those of you who have that color, which has more of a red base to it. This is a true orange, melon. Sweet &amp; great for spring/summer!!</li>
    <li> I really liked the Gelish Candyland Orange Cream Dream polish. My favorite color is orange, and my nail salon does not carry a large selection of shades of orange.  I would like to see an even softer orange, or cream version.  Nice to know that I can purchase additional colors on line.</li>
    <li> I received this within 2 days and could not wait to try it.  I absolutely love this color--great for summer.</li>
    <li> I love gelish!!! The color looks like the picture but it has a metallic quality to it plus it only need two coats to get the real color to show threw!</li>
    <li> This is another great gelish product. The color is like the swatch on the screen with more sparkle. A great one to pair with other colors or use by itself. Also applies nice and easy no streaking.</li>
    <li> This product has great color and the delivery was very fast. I recommend choosing this site for your next and future purchases.</li>
    <li> Orange cream dream is a really great, vibrant color.  It was fun to wear for Halloween, but is also a great summer color. It&#x27;s a little darker than it looks in pictures, but I love it!</li>
    <li> Item appeared to be new, however when I opened the package and inspected the polish, it seemed as though it was previously opened therefore leaving a polish ring around the area where it closes.  The polish was essentially \\&quot;leaking out\\&quot;.  I was disappointed to say the least, as they should have inspected this prior to shipping it out and mad sure the lid was tightly sealed. I will try to avoid this seller in the meantime, as these items are often non-returnable :(</li>
    <li> very disappointed.. ;( it came busted!!! i loved the color and was so excited to get it but opened it up and it was completely busted.. i was going to call amazon but i didnt want to be a pain</li>
    <li> Pretty, sparkly, bright-ish color. I used it for Halloween themed nails and again for nail accents during Thanksgiving. I used it as just tips and on the whole nail and it looked good both ways. Absolutely needs at least 2 coats to cover properly.</li>
