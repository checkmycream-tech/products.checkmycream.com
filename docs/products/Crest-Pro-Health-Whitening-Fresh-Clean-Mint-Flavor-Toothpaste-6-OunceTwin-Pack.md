<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Still using the toothpaste, teeth feel clean, mouth smells minty Fresh. No complaints here. Its toothpaste! I enjoy the &#x27;flavor&#x27;.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time trying this type from the Crest line. It&#x27;s not too pasty like typical whitening toothpaste and it doesn&#x27;t leave too much of an after taste.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I did not like this toothpaste for the following reasons: it did not foam enough for me which means it probably did not get down underneath the gumline to help loosen plaque, it did not freshen breath unless you brushed 2x back to back, and after brushing the toothpaste left alot of film.  I even tried wiping my mouth with a towel after brushing to get rid of the film that was left behind, but even after that, there was still film which is a pain when you are in a hurry to get ready.  My dentist said that it seemed I had more plaque this visit than usual, so I will not be buying this particular toothpaste again.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this toothpaste and we will continue to use it. Mouth feels fresh and clean after using it. No problems with the cap like other reviewers say.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that has been great hands down.  This is a great price for your money. :)</li>
    <li> I love this Toothpaste and so does my Family.. It not only cleans and polishes your Teeth and mouth but also helps whiten your Teeth</li>
    <li> I like the taste and the flat snap cap.  Our teeth  feel clean after brushing.  It seems to be a good Crest product.</li>
    <li> This was a great Value at a Great Price.  I normally don&#x27;t look for things like this on AMAZON but I did a search and found this.  It is a lot cheaper than what you would find at the Grocery Store.  I saved half of what I would have paid at the stores.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because it was a good deal and well reviewed. I have been using Rembrandt, which is costly and sometimes hard to get on Amazon. Switching from Rembrandt to Crest Pro Health is one of the worst experiences I have had with toothpaste. My teeth do not feel clean. The toothpaste feels like hair gel compared to the texture of other toothpastes. It is incredibly blue and leaves a visible stain after brushing. It tastes like pure sugar and fake mint. I did not even know I cared this much about toothpaste until I switched. I&#x27;ve since given the toothpaste to my roommates and bought a three pack of Rembrandt.</li>
    <li> Quiet abrasive, so be careful. Definitely cleans the mouth. It did leave a strange film on my gums when I first started using it. Almost as if my gums were peeling(they weren&#x27;t) but that has since stopped.</li>
    <li> Kind of gritty but it has improved my whiteness (can I really say that here heh) quite a bit in the month I have been using ... the toothpaste ...</li>
    <li> I used to love Crest Pro-Health toothpaste until I realized that it was actually staining my teeth (and not white)!  If you read the fine print on the tube, it even attests to this!  I switched brands immediately and noticed that my teeth were whiter within a few days.  I am appalled that a product could actually do the opposite of what it is intended to do and under such a big name brand.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product again and again and again.</li>
    <li> Arrived superfast. I know it will sound a little vierd, but I love the taste of this toothpaste. Keeps your mouth really fresh for a long time.</li>
    <li> I could not expect much more than what I bought toothpaste. It does the job very well! I am happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Set these up as a subscription by filtering any items your order and then filter it to show only subscriptions.  After you add6 every month it takes off an additional 15% which is awesome.  I have most of my toiletries show up on my door step monthly and don&#x27;t even have to leave the house.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;M 87 years old.  Teeth the dentist predicted would soon have to go are still good and causing no pain when I use Crest Pro Health.</li>
    <li> i hate the weird feeling of  so called whitening effect ..it has weird feeling to it in my mouth, other than that, i love crest toothpaste</li>
    <li> I use only Crest and it has given me great results over the years.  I like using the Crest systems for dental care as it seems to compliment each other.</li>
    <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health for a long time and I have healthy gums and teeth. At my last dental appointment I had no cavities. My oldest son is a dentist and approves of me using this product.</li>
    <li> My mouth feels cleaner after brushing with it. It also is recommended for people with dry mouth. Getting it through Amazon is convenient, and less expensive.</li>
    <li> Very good, fresh toothpaste that will keep your teeth clean. The price point and value makes it a very good buy.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has a great flavor and leaves me with a fresh clean feeling for a long time after using it.</li>
    <li> This is our family favorite toothpaste (I was never a Crest fan until this one came out) &amp; I got this on Subscribe &amp; Save so the price was ideal for the quantity/size. Unfortunately, I got an email that it&#x27;s no longer available on Subscribe &amp; Save. Still, it&#x27;s a great toothpaste &amp; leaves our teeth feeling very clean. I will continue to buy no matter what.</li>
    <li> Has a few toxic things in it, but it&#x27;s what my husband prefers.  I guess if it didn&#x27;t it would not be Crest.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is too strong. It does a good job, but, if I brush with it too long (more than 1.5 minutes) then I&#x27;ll have some stripped mouth lining the next day; therefore, I&#x27;m only using it for short brushes, and everyother day, etc.</li>
    <li> Does not whiten teeth any better than other toothpaste that I have tried. Sorry guys, I wish it did. It is a nice toothpaste but doesn&#x27;t do everything that it claims.</li>
    <li> Like the flavor, Crest is always a solid purchase option.  Purchased this to get to $25 for free shipping.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great whitening toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Have seen positive effects on my teeth. Look forward to purchasing it again. Also like brushing now using this type of toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I went to the doctor with a complaint that I had a really sore mouth and tongue. It was like boiling water (or chemicals) had been swished in my mouth. He had no idea what the problem would be. Eliminated thrush, cold sores, ulcers...all I could do was wait. That was on November 29. I still can&#x27;t taste properly. But the good news is my gums are now not so sore that they bleed when I try to brush my teeth. I couldn&#x27;t work out what the problem could be but after reading some of the reviews, can only think it is the toothpaste which I started using at that time - and things improved when I stopped using this one. Try having a constantly sore mouth for a month and see what it does to your quality of life. I am talking about the roof of my mouth, the top, bottom and sides of my tongue, my cheeks and my gums. I will never buy Crest again. It is just not worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand/flavour of toothpaste for a few years now. What can I say? The value of the twin pack on amazon is good. The flavor is a good balance of &amp;#34;freshness&amp;#34; without being over powering or strong. It leaves my mouth feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste has the larger flip top style top, as opposed to the smaller, screw on tops. I find the flip tops help keep things cleaner. It can be a little hard to get that very last bit of toothpaste out, so it&#x27;s good to stock up and have a backup.</li>
    <li> This Crest toothpaste is a good item and it really does seem to help at least somewhat with helping keeping your teeth somewhat white.</li>
    <li> Toothpaste has a great flavor - not too minty or strong, and cleans well.  My husband and I both love this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this toothpaste before and am overall happy with it. I most likely will purchase this toothpaste again......</li>
    <li> Toothpaste great, but cap is the worst.  I have always been a Crest girl.  I like Crest better than the other brands and I especially like this particular toothpaste.  However, the so-called snap-cap is the worst and as a result I refuse to purchase this product anymore.  First, it is impossible to shut the cap tight without squeezing a little on the tube so that toothpaste gets all over the top.  Second, it you leave it slightly open in addition to being unhygienic it leaks on everything.  I have a tube at work and one at home and I am constantly cleaning toothpaste off everything.  Seriously, what was wrong with the old-fashioned screw top.  Worked fine in my opinion.  What a way to ruin an otherwise great product.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t write well in English</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste, leaves your mouth feeling fresh for a long time . It says there is a benefit to use it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste.  I don&#x27;t know what the little scrubby things in the toothpaste are but they sure clean my teeth well.</li>
    <li> This tooth paste is great. Leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean without a weird aftertaste. Can even eat and drink after brushing without being completely grossed out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the taste</li>
    <li> Been a Crest user since the 70&#x27;s and despise this product, too gritty and make my gums constantly bleed, I do not see any benefit to this toothpaste.. I would avoid, in my opinion not happy at all with product.</li>
    <li> I used to use Crest 3d vivid, recently switch to this pro-health toothpaste. I never thought there could be such big difference between toothpastes.. I immediately felt the weird taste of this &#x27;Mint flavor&#x27;. After used, I also have the problem of &#x27;dead skin&#x27; like other reviewers, it might not be dangerous for my health, but peeling mouth skin twice every day is definitely not what I bought this for. I am afraid I DO NOT recommend this toothpaste..</li>
    <li> I like the deal and they do clean your teeth. I just was not crazy about the taste. Otherwise, it is what it is, toothpaste</li>
    <li> The package came so soon and the tubes were larger than I had anticipated which is a really great surprise.</li>
    <li> My family loves this toothpaste and we never buy another kind. It leaves my mouth feeling clean and breath fresh. I have not notices a significant difference in appearance of my teeth in terms of whiteness but my dentist has informed me that generally toothpastes alone cannot whiten teeth without the use of strips or trays. This toothpaste helps in prolonging whiteness and fighting yellowing of teeth. Love the Crest brand!</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste very much and my Dentist recommends it as highly as any toothpaste. Mainly a personal preference.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free to try out in exchange for my review which is 100% my opinion. I enjoyed this toothpaste. I love the way it leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste seems to clean our teeth better than other brands. My only wish is that they would make it in cinnamon.</li>
    <li> what can I said is tooth paste.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s supposed to whiten your teeth, but it can&#x27;t overcome the daily pot of coffee my husband drinks.  At least his breath is better.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this toothpaste. The flavor was very pleasant, and it left a very clean feeling in my mouth. I would recommend this to everyone that wants more than just the basic cavity protection toothpaste. I got a full size sample of this by signing up to Smiley 360, and this was mailed to me free to try. I&#x27;m glad that I received it, I would definitely purchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> another overpriced health and beauty item on amazon.  love this toothpaste but won&#x27;t buy from amazon.</li>
    <li> Feels like my lips and cheeks were burned with acid and are raw after using for just two days!</li>
    <li> I received this product for free to give my honest opinion. I was skeptical first but must say this toothpaste works great. It removes buildup and has whitening ingredients, my mouth feels fresh and clean after each cleaning.  I can recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very strong taste of mint and cheers me up in the morning. Think I will subscribe from the next purchase.</li>
    <li> The crystals that are in it are really annoying. The taste is really sweet, it seems that you are brushing with sugar. It does not give a clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I was asked to try this product from Smiley 360 I don&#x27;t like this product at all. It&#x27;s very gritty and has a weird after taste and I noticed after 4 days my teeth started turning a weird grayish color.</li>
    <li> I received a 6 oz sample of this product for free for the purpose of this review and the opinions in this review are 100% my own. I loved the taste. It left my mouth feeling very clean and fresh and it lasted for much longer than other toothpastes that I&#x27;ve used in the past. It&#x27;s only been about 2 weeks but I can already see that my teeth are whiter. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and I switched to Crest Pro Health Sensitive + Enamel Shield toothpaste about 3 months ago. I immediately noticed that my lips were chapping more but I thought it was just because with summer here, I was getting dehydrated. Then, when the inside of my cheeks started shredding and peeling CONSTANTLY, I mentioned it to my girlfriend and was amazed when she told me her cheeks and the roof of her mouth were doing the same thing. A little research and I found out the same thing everyone here is complaining about, it&#x27;s CREST PRO HEALTH TOOTHPASTE that was causing it. We switched to another brand and the problem INSTANTLY went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was curious if people using the other Pro Health toothpastes were having the same issues. Obviously, they are. When I read a review making fun of the person who complained about \\&quot;gooey stuff that&#x27;s quite unexplainable\\&quot; I INSTANTLY understood what they meant. That&#x27; EXACTLY how I felt when I started noticing the \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; in my mouth. Finally, after wondering where it was coming from for DAYS, I was running my tongue around inside my mouth and realized the skin in my mouth was COMPLETELY SHREDDED and the \\&quot;gooey stuff\\&quot; I was finding was all the DEAD SKIN that was slewing off the insides of my cheeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do a little research people, this stuff is BAD FOR YOU. It is eating the skin right out of your mouth and turning it into a gooey slime. That doesn&#x27;t sound very \\&quot;Pro-Health\\&quot; to me!</li>
    <li> This came in quickly and is exactly as advertised. It works great. I like it a lot but it does sort of foam a little when you use it; however, I think it is suppose to do that because of the whitening product in the toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Good price and great product.</li>
    <li> I rarely write a review but this morning&#x27;s brush requires it. In an attempt to save money, i&#x27;ve not replaced this toothpaste, but it has no redeeming factors. Mint flavor? I prefer the taste of morning breath than the way this toothpaste leaves my mouth tasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whitening? I don&#x27;t notice a difference despite my diligence with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall dissatisfied. Perhaps my teeth are cleaner. But taste and the ability to whiten are promised and not fulfilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s time to replace this finally. Unfortunate because I still have a brand new tube to run through.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and is perfect, came quickly and exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I like the flavor and it has a bit of a texture which leaves your teeth feeling cleaner. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> these were a good price, so i got them. this is the only kind of toothpaste we use now.  We find it works great.</li>
    <li> i love the crest sensitivity only toothpaste but cannot find it here anymore or anywhere</li>
    <li> great, cleans and brightens teeth as product advertises</li>
    <li> Excellent price and an outstanding product.  Needed sensitive toothpaste and this far exceeded by expectations.  Gentle on the gums and prevents any irritation I would receive from extremely cold foods and drinks.  Dentist recommended a sensitive toothpaste and I have noticed a huge improvement since using this.  I am a long time user and the excellent price makes it a great bargain.</li>
    <li> I mean its tooth paste people. Do you really need to read a review to pull the trigger and spend $4.  Yes Crest is good. Buy.</li>
    <li> Some of the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve had at a great price. Crest Pro Health toothpastes are all great but this really seems to do what it advertises: whitening your teeth. It&#x27;s got a litle bit of grit to it that I love in toothpastes, makes my mouth and teeth feel smoother and cleaner.</li>
    <li> Crest Pro Health toothpaste was given to me as a sample by my Dentist, I have been using this brand for the last eight years.  Only toothpaste I&#x27;ll buy!</li>
    <li> This may be a great product for cleaning your teeth.  However, the sweet taste is overpowering!</li>
    <li> I got this free for the purpose of this review and man my mouth feels clean. I like the way the toothpaste have that slight tingling feeling on my gums so I know its working. I have been using Crest Pro Health Whitening for about a few months and I can notice a difference in the color of my teeth (not much, but you can tell).&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this toothpaste to anyone that wants to brighten there smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This opinion is 100% my own.</li>
    <li> i like the way it whitened my teeth because i am a coffee drinker and a cigarette smoker and it made a big difference on my teeth</li>
    <li> Been using this for some time now &amp; I am happy with the results!!</li>
    <li> Compared to other Crest, pro-health is the best, for me at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually feels like you&#x27;re teeth are clean after brushing and it feels like their being cleaned while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using a Crest gel toothpaste before wasn&#x27;t doing the best job. This toothpaste is not a gel and it works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try or 2</li>
    <li> I received a 6 oz sample of this product for free for the purpose of this review and the opinions in this review are 100% my own. I loved the taste. It left my mouth feeling very clean and fresh and it lasted for much longer than other toothpastes that I&#x27;ve used in the past. It&#x27;s only been about 2 weeks but I can already see that my teeth are whiter. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This great product, I am not fond of gels, but this seems a lot better.  Leaves clean taste in mouth too.</li>
    <li> I like the little crunchy particles in it, it&#x27;s just like the stuff the dentists used to use! That sounds gross but I really like it. It also makes your teeth squeak because they&#x27;re so clean!</li>
    <li> L love the way my mouth feels after using tis product, No burning sensation just cool fresh breath. Great feeling with no aftertaste.</li>
    <li> we have been using this tooth past for te last 6 years and we don&#x27;t need to go to the dentist all I can say it GOOD</li>
    <li> Contains Stannous Flouride instead of Sodium Flouride, which the warning on the back of the box says can stain your teeth.</li>
    <li> Excellent taste and texture, and the 2 pack is an excellent value. I have been using this brand for years...</li>
    <li> Crest did an awful job packaging this toothpaste formula. I have tried multiple varieties, and every single time the toothpaste leaks all over when stored and causes a big mess. This formula is in dire need of a twist cap. The toothpaste leaks onto the flip cap, making it difficult to impossible to close all the way (this is also unsanitary). When the tube is laid on its side, toothpaste gets all over the bathroom counter resulting in wasted product and a sticky mess. For this reason, I cannot recommend this toothpaste to anyone.</li>
    <li> It works good. I like the peppermint taste and my teeth feel clean. I like the consistency of the past also.</li>
    <li> The amount of QQ from other users is hilarious. One talks about terrible packaging because of the design of the toothpaste and talks about it leaking everywhere. I use these types of design all the time and don&#x27;t have such a problem. You just don&#x27;t know how to handle it properly and blame it on the design, good job. Others say it &#x27;burns their mouth&#x27; or &#x27;causes gooey stuff that is completely unexplainable&#x27; and can&#x27;t quite possibly mean that the toothpaste is doing its job and you have a dirty mouth. I use this toothpaste with listerine mouthwash and sometimes I get the white-lining around the lips and sometimes I don&#x27;t. I just rinse my mouth in the morning and it&#x27;s gone. I don&#x27;t get it through out the day, only when I use it before sleep and i get it in the morning. It&#x27;s just dead cells in your mouth coming off. Go ask your dentist about it instead of \\&quot;googling it and being relieved that other uninformed users have told me that it is in fact the insides of my cheek burning off! Yes it must be that!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste!  Leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.  The twin pack is a great value.  Easy flip top cap makes it less messy.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste because it was a good deal for a two pack.  The first time I tried it, and several times after that, the toothpaste left a strange feeling in my mouth.  It leaves the bottom of my mouth, underneath my tongue, super dry.  The toothpaste reminds me of the old school kind I used as a kid, it has that chalky/sandy feeling to it.  Definitely a PASTE and not a gel toothpaste that many of us are used to seeing.  I think that might have something to do with this strange reaction.  Other than that, the toothpaste works just fine.  It freshens my breath and leaves my mouth feeling clean.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again because of the drying thing, but it&#x27;s not so unpleasant that I&#x27;m not going to finish using it.</li>
    <li> Got this when I was getting some household items from Amazon, and for the price for two, you couldn&#x27;t beat it. I mean, who doesn&#x27;t need toothpaste, LOL?!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is horrible, the gel is so dry and it&#x27;s impossible to brush your teeth. I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective item although both were the same, but will not buy crest again.</li>
    <li> Works great, good tasting, cleans well, whitens teeth and freshens breath. Good size and value, will last you months and months.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 2-pack on sale for $3.45.  This is the cool gritty taste flavor.  I would purchase again but not for the same price.  NOt a deal at the 2-pack $3.45 price.</li>
    <li> I have used Crest toothpastes all my life and never would change.  Their Pro Health is fantastic!  It tastes great and it keeps my teeth nice and white along with a lot of other benefits.  It is so convenient to buy on Amazon instead of going to the store.  My opinion is and always will be that you cannot go wrong with this wonderful toothpaste.  Hight Recommend!</li>
    <li> I only use Crest as it&#x27;s so refreshing in the mouth but most of all it does a good job on the teeth</li>
    <li> The product and price are great and amazon prime saves me a trip to the store. Just two days latter it arrives, like having a personal assistance even for tooth paste!</li>
    <li> I love Crest Pro-health. My teeth feel so clean. This is a great price. I have it on my subscribe and save orders.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist said this is a good product and when I found it for such a good price from Amazon, I bought it.  Great protection for your teeth.</li>
    <li> Product loyalty ... that is me when it comes to Crest.  This was a great price for this and I like this flavor a lot.  So thank you.</li>
    <li> I try to stick to crest but I really like a mixed toothpaste (some gel some whitening) and this was really just the gel with some grits in it.  It made my mouth taste a little funny afterwards.  I wouldn&#x27;t say my teeth decreased in whiteness or sensitivity or anything like that from using it, it just wasn&#x27;t that minty, whitening, freshness you feel like you should have after watching the commercial.  Going to be investigating something else for now.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite items on my Subscribe &amp; Save list.  It&#x27;s a perfect two month supply for me and the wife.  Has a good flavor that tastes fresh, but doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
    <li> My new favorite toothpaste!  Helps eliminate mild sensitivity and gently whitens teeth over time.  This is a complete toothpaste that helps your teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> I didnt like the taste of the toothpaste that much and I feel there is residual left in my mouth which is hard to rinse off.</li>
    <li> I always use Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, because it gives my mouth such a clean feeling. I always feel so fresh after brushing with this. However, it does sometimes sting/burn a bit on my gums, so if you have sensitive gums though you might want to be careful with this toothpaste. While I like this product it does tend to leak all over the counter if the cap is left slightly open or if I stand it up.</li>
    <li> only toothpaste i will use. its does whiten teeth, no lie. not too harsh in taste. gives you a light sweet after taste. i recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> Good taste with mint and not chalky as many seem to be.  I like crest anyway so this combo is great. Save many in multi pack</li>
    <li> This crap stained my teeth. Left a brownish blackish stain on my lower front teeth that only the dentist was able to remove. I should&#x27;ve heeded the warning on the package. Stannous Fluoride does stain. And who wants a whitening product that stains your teeth!? Useless.</li>
    <li> I like the gritty texture of this toothpaste. But there are now so many line extensions I get confused. There&#x27;s whitening, tartar control, and various similar flavors. I can&#x27;t keep track.</li>
    <li> This is the identical item I would purchase locally. The packaging is the same as the grocery store and the item arrived on time. The product was less expensive due to subscribe and save and the product performed as I expected it would.</li>
    <li> Works well. 2 tubes last me a year. Nice price. Helps prevent expensive dentist visits. What more could I want.</li>
    <li> This is the best tasting toothpaste on the market.  And my teeth have been noticibly whiter when I started using it along with a pre-rinse.  I bought 10 of these to take overseas with me.</li>
    <li> The only knock I have is this tube is hard to close.  And it leads to having a somewhat messy appearance.  As for the toothpaste, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Just not crazy about this toothpaste.  Much  better ones out there. Try arm and hammer. That&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has little flecks of polyethylene (plastic) which can actually embed itself in your gums.  I&#x27;m switching permanently to another brand.</li>
    <li> I use the Crest Pro Health series for everyone in my house. It gives my mouth the best clean feeling after brushing than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used. Buying these in a twin pack was also convenient. I also like the whitening version here to help my teeth stay white in between dental visits.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of aftertaste but decent paste.  Will probably order different flavor of Crest in the future but this is okay if you don&#x27;t hate baking soda</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of CrestProHealth and have had no problems using it.  I like the smooth clean feeling it gives after brushing, and it kind of feels like when you come home from the dentist and your teeth are all clean. I have a dentist appt. for a cleaning in a couple weeks so then my teeth will start looking really white.</li>
    <li> Cleans my teeth, tastes nice.</li>
    <li> I was given a free tube of Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste to try. This opinion is 100% mine.  I usually use sensitive toothpaste because of bad experiences especially with whitening toothpastes in the past.  This time was totally different.  this toothpaste is great. I noticed right away the great taste and freshness.  It left my mouth feeling clean and I didn&#x27;t even have to use mouthwash afterwards.  It has a very pleasant taste.  I have also noticed my teeth not only feel cleaner but are starting to sparkle more.  I love it and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like foamy toothpaste, as it tends to make me gag. This one isn&#x27;t too bad when it comes to foam. The taste is good, and I like the stand-up tube it comes in. I also like that I can order it online and save myself a trip to the store.</li>
    <li> This stuff has some &#x27;grit&#x27; to it, it actually feels like it works too. Normal toothpaste seems much too liquidy and just kind of slides off your teeth and brush and more just sits on your tongue and gum areas...not this stuff.</li>
    <li> Crest is the only toothpaste we use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure where to begin for a toothpaste review. . . This is my favorite toothpaste and the price from amazon really can&#x27;t be beat. If you&#x27;re a fan of toothpaste with little crunchy crystals in the paste, you&#x27;ll like this one.</li>
    <li> love this got it free from smiley 360 great stuff</li>
    <li> This toothpaste taste good .it does a great job of whitening teeth I saw a difference in 1 week .the price is low and I think I am sold on it .my family uses this as well. I got introduced to this product for free from Smiley360 and I am so happy I used regular Crest before but now I have changed to this one</li>
    <li> The toothpaste I bought from Amazon has more paste than the ones sold in local stores. Although both toothpastes from Amazon and local stores have the same size, but Amazon&#x27;s toothpaste look and feel more fulfilled in pastes than local stores&#x27; toothpaste. What a valuable buy!</li>
    <li> What a great product at a great price. I set this up on Subscribe and Save and it is so very worth it.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday. With my sonicare electric tooth brush. My wife use it too. She use what I buy.</li>
    <li> This is my favourite toothpaste. Isn&#x27;t that crazy, to have a favourite toothpaste? Anyway, my mouth feels really fresh for longer when  use this. Couldn&#x27;t find any at my local store so decided to get some from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Item does what it&#x27;s suppose to. Squeezing gets messy as it does not flow smoothly, however this does not impact the products ulimate purpose</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this toothpaste, but it just feels good to brush with it.  It&#x27;s not too strong of a minty flavor and does its job well.  The tube is standard, but the cap is snap on and I&#x27;ve only had a problem once with it coming undone in my bag during travels. (Though it is over the 3oz limit for TSA airline traveling, so get the travel size for that).</li>
    <li> I received this for free to sample from Smile360. Opinions are mine!  I am very picky about my toothpaste.  I&#x27;m 32 and have used Dental Care as far back add I can remember.  I usually won&#x27;t even use another toothpaste.  This stuff was pretty good.  The next trip to the store for toothpaste will be a tough decision.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint toothpaste to try.  After using it for several days I began to see a difference in my teeth.  They looked a little whiter.  It is not as noticeable as using whitener strips, but I am encouraged that with longer use, my teeth will look considerably whiter.  I also like the taste, and it made my mouth feel clean.</li>
    <li> Great product that came quickly and as indicated in the description. Arrived in perfect shape as if it was bought off the store shelf.</li>
    <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND, works great at getting rid of bad breath and helping to fight gum disease.</li>
    <li> This is a great package deal! Crest Pro-Health is a great product and I have not been able to find it elsewhere at this price!</li>
    <li> my favorite toothpaste. havent had a cavity ever since i switched to this about 5 years ago. isn&#x27;t the best to help your breath but definitely the best for tooth and mouth protection.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaster, Its awesome, and great especially if you have sensitive teeth, they have a line geared to that!</li>
    <li> this is my first time trying the pro health toothpaste so im not sure if this is normal but the moment it makes contact with my teeth i can feel a warm reaction caused by the toothpaste. besides the warm sensation all over my mouth as i brush, the taste is just ok. the minty-ness is not that strong so after you rinse there is no long lasting minty fresh feeling in your mouth like with other popular toothpastes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really a toothpaste connoisseur, but I like this one just fine. No cons, but nothing that really stands out either:)</li>
    <li> I was hoping that purchasing this item over amazon.com would be cheaper than going to my local Wal-Mart store to purchase, but I was wrong. Oh well. It&#x27;s still good toothpaste, just not a fantastic price.</li>
