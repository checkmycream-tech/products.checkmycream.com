      <li>I also need to read fine print more often, but in all it was good product at a good price.</li>
      <li>Then take a hand full of your own good conditioner ( I use Redkin so-soft)</li>
      <li>First let me say that I was happy with the results of this product.</li>
      <li>I love my new hair color frost and design is very good:)</li>
      <li>but I love how it turned out.</li>
      <li>so I am writing this review, because I think it&#x27;s ridicules we have to pay $75 and more for some highlights.</li>
      <li>Would buy again, for sure.</li>
      <li>Believe it or not, it looks better then the salon.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>For more blonder highlights you should probably use the champagne colored kit.</li>
      <li>the only thing i regret is that i didnt buy more than one box!!!</li>
      <li>For a person who has never done this before, I was quite happy with the results from this product and recommend it for anyone wanting to frost/ add high lights to their hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy, looks better than the Salon.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a cap</li>
      <li>great product professional Results&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but other than that this is a great DIY highlights kit!</li>
      <li>but it was easy to do.</li>
      <li>someone who has been going to salons all my life, this was not an easy transition.</li>
      <li>I strongly suggest that you do NOT purchase this item.</li>
      <li>The cap included is fine.</li>
      <li>BUT IT IS IMPORTANT</li>
      <li>The savings is significant.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast as well :)</li>
      <li>pretty easy to do.</li>
      <li>so amazing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;the item is loyal to the description ..</li>
      <li>You can barely even tell that I have highlights, but it has an amazing color effect.</li>
      <li>Always great results the cap ensures that you can&#x27;t mess it up.</li>
      <li>Be sure to comb you hair to the part where it falls naturally before putting the cap on.</li>
      <li>The nice thing is - even if you use it all the time - and pull you hair through the cap - it covers what you&#x27;ve already done without it going that ghostly white that some of the others frosting shades do.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you wear the gloves and wear just a bra or old teeshirt.</li>
      <li>so the carmel color mixed in looks really good and natural!</li>
      <li>and they said to be very gently with the cap</li>
      <li>I love the two different sized hooks.</li>
      <li>the follow with bottom right..don&#x27;t go to top left b/c</li>
      <li>Better to use a standard highlight kit and foil.  </li>
      <li>Most of the highlights were situated at the front of my head/face and none were done at the back or underneath.</li>
      <li>Also, it is all over my hair, evenly distributed everywhere, and not only on the top layer but in depth.     </li>
      <li>Resulting color was nice but looked like it was done months ago due to</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on the hunt for an easier method of doing at-home highlights, because while the price is right for this product and the results were better than expected, I just don&#x27;t have the time or patience to deal with this again.</li>
      <li>I do wish they&#x27;d make a kit with foils rather than the plastic cap, it&#x27;d give me more control &amp;amp; it&#x27;d be easier for long hair.</li>
      <li>If you follow the instructions you really can&#x27;t do it</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>The cap was VERY sturdy for me.</li>
      <li>but I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I bougth this when I was really into coloring my hair</li>
      <li>I tend to pull it out in different thicknesses in order to give the highlights a more natural look.</li>
      <li>So it would be nice if Loreal put the ingredients in smaller packages so it could be used to highlight your hair multiple times.</li>
      <li>The cap also tore in many places, and I read the other reviews</li>
      <li>Better than what i expected!</li>
      <li>and I think that this product is good but do be careful and do not leave it on your hair too long.</li>
      <li>Please do yourself a favor and go to a hairdresser to begin with if you want high lights.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Due to increasing costs I&#x27;ve starting coloring my own hair.</li>
      <li>I was a little hesitant to use the highlighting cap as most youtube videos say not to</li>
      <li>The strands (natural) that I highlighted (per the instructions) are very damaged from the product.</li>
      <li>I have medium to dark brown hair and left it in for 25 minutes and got nice golden blonde highlights.</li>
      <li>so I will probably need to get a box of dark dye to match it to my natural color before I do any more highlights.</li>
      <li>this stuff works good, just pull thin layers thru the headpiece and leave on for 25 minutes and woola</li>
      <li>(I learned that one the hard way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pull more hairs on the part and though out all the way to the middle back of my head the bottom of my hair stays my \\&quot;natural\\&quot; color and my top has golden caramel to blonde high lights through out.</li>
      <li>(I know this sounds a bit cheesy and commercial like, but it is true!!:).</li>
      <li>This way the end result will be evenly distributed, abundant, and yet, subtle.</li>
      <li>I have really light red hair like a strawberry blonde</li>
      <li>very natural looking.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many hair color products in the past &amp; haven&#x27;t dared try anything for years.  </li>
      <li>The caramel colored kit brightens and blends into my hair and makes it look more natural by breaking up the solid color, rather then adding definite streaks of blonde.</li>
      <li>I use the smaller metal pull for more natural look the other one will give you a \\&quot;chunky look.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>My hair reaches the middle of my back, there is plenty of color to do a full highlite.</li>
      <li>i buy this overseas...and the box came complete and without scrashes...</li>
      <li>The end result was UNBELIEVABLY natural.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recommend brushing/combing hair straight back as directed in the instructions, you&#x27;ll end up not getting close to the roots.</li>
      <li>My hair is medium/auburnish brown naturally</li>
      <li>When the box says for light blonde to dark brown hair</li>
      <li>When it comes to boxed dye get the very most expensive one.</li>
      <li>My natural color is a ash brown, to blonde.</li>
      <li>My natural color is a ash brown, to blonde.</li>
      <li>I am a natural blonde, the 1st time I used it to add a pop of very blonde in my hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very unattractive, and not worth the damage to your hair.</li>
      <li>I comb my hair straight down.</li>
      <li>For my hair (med brownish with a little red tone, if I leave it on for 20 minutes, it turns out exactly like I want it to.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It takes more than 2 hours to deal with this product! My arms were aching by the time I was finished, pulling little strands of hair....piece-by-piece...through almost impossible to create holes!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s easy, looks better than the Salon.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a cap and I just make the holes a little&lt;br /&gt;wider for bolder streaks. Would buy again, for sure.</li>
    <li> Cap a pain and stops color from getting to the roots.  Better to use a standard highlight kit and foil.  Resulting color was nice but looked like it was done months ago due to the color not getting to the roots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many hair color products in the past &amp; haven&#x27;t dared try anything for years.  I have dark brown hair with a little gray near the temples &amp; I used this product to scatter highlights just near the front.  It looks great!  It&#x27;s just the right soft dark blonde that doesn&#x27;t look fake or brassy.  This is a great product for highlights that look just like the picture!</li>
    <li> This stuff will turn your hair into streaky chunks, making it look like you bleached your hair with peroxide.  Very cheap, tacky result that looks awful. I plan to color my hair after this. Seriously, don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  The strands (natural) that I highlighted (per the instructions) are very damaged from the product. I&#x27;m not a novice in hair highlighting or color, and this product is among the worst that I&#x27;ve used.     I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would like the result of this product. Unless your hair is naturally the color of Barbie-bleached hair, you&#x27;re going to get a terrible, streaky, orange-bleach-blonde look. It&#x27;s very unattractive, and not worth the damage to your hair. My hair was in great condition before this- I literally have had to cut chunks off my hair that had the \\&quot;highlights\\&quot; on them. This product causes extreme damage to hair, and the color result is heinous. I strongly suggest that you do NOT purchase this item.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because i wanted to highlights my sister&#x27;s hair.. i was afraid because i had never done this before....but was so so amazing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;the item is loyal to the description ..the only thing i regret is that i didnt buy more than one box!!! i truly recommended!!.. i buy this overseas...and the box came complete and without scrashes...</li>
    <li> I like the results with this!</li>
    <li> When the box says for light blonde to dark brown hair they mean it. Do not put this on black hair. Lesson learned......</li>
    <li> I was afraid to try this product, especially after some of the reviews. The end results surpassed my wildest hopes! (I know this sounds a bit cheesy and commercial like, but it is true!!:). The cap was VERY sturdy for me. Pulling the hair through did take a while but it was easy to do. I would recommend that you have someone helping you with that part (my mom did that for me).     The end result was UNBELIEVABLY natural. You can barely even tell that I have highlights, but it has an amazing color effect. Also, it is all over my hair, evenly distributed everywhere, and not only on the top layer but in depth.     I think one of the tricks is that (especially when you first do it) try to pull relatively thin strands of hair but try to use ALL the holes, not just a few. This way the end result will be evenly distributed, abundant, and yet, subtle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of years and redo my highlights about every 2 month. For my hair (med brownish with a little red tone, if I leave it on for 20 minutes, it turns out exactly like I want it to. I color my hair every couple of months or so and sometimes I do it shortly after I colored and other times I have used it after the color had faded a lot. Depending on the results you desire, these highlights are lighter then my hair but not yellowish or white. For more blonder highlights you should probably use the champagne colored kit. The caramel colored kit brightens and blends into my hair and makes it look more natural by breaking up the solid color, rather then adding definite streaks of blonde. It is unfortunate that salon highlighting is so unbelievably expensive. I am so grateful for home highlighting kits like this and I often appreciate peoples reviews so I am writing this review, because I think it&#x27;s ridicules we have to pay $75 and more for some highlights. This is a great product!  The cap included is fine. The toner included works great. I do it myself all the time and it works great for me. I do the back of my head also with no problem but if you find it difficult to do it yourself, just ask someone to poke through the already predetermined holes in the cap. If you follow the instructions you really can&#x27;t do it \\&quot;wrong\\&quot;.....BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO NOT PULL A LOT OF HAIR THROUGH THE HOLES, ONLY THIN STRANDS, UNLESS YOU WANT CHUNKY HIGHLIGHTS!</li>
    <li> this stuff works good, just pull thin layers thru the headpiece and leave on for 25 minutes and woola, you looked like you stepped out&lt;br /&gt;of a hairsalon and for less than $11 beats the $90 you&#x27;d pay for a hairdresser!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product thinking that it would highlight my hair. My hair is medium/auburnish brown naturally and I figured it would look at least similar to the photo on the box. The end result was a disaster. Here&#x27;s why... Loreal for some reason only packs a small tube of toner into the box. I have long hair and when I applied it, there was not enough toner so it turned my hair orange in some places. The cap caused the highlights to be distributed in very little areas. Most of the highlights were situated at the front of my head/face and none were done at the back or underneath. The highlights also did not start at the roots, they would start at the middle of the hair. The cap also tore in many places, and I read the other reviews and they said to be very gently with the cap and I was. I just now got back from a local salon, where I had to pay $45.00 to have them covered over and my hair brought back to a close version of my natural color (which is extremely hard to replicate because my hair is two-toned naturally). I am so unhappy with this product and would have expected alot better from Loreal! Please do yourself a favor and go to a hairdresser to begin with if you want high lights. You will save yourself money, heartache, and grief in the long run.</li>
    <li> great product professional Results&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair, down to my waist and I am 5&#x27;8&#x27;&#x27;. I used to go to the salon and pay $300+ for highlights before a cut. After the second time of two different salons messing up my hair, I turned to this after It was recommend to me. Believe it or not, it looks better then the salon. Always great results the cap ensures that you can&#x27;t mess it up. Be sure to comb you hair to the part where it falls naturally before putting the cap on. Also conb through all tangels before. I never use up all of the product, and my hair is very long. Make sure you wear the gloves and wear just a bra or old teeshirt. IT WILL BLEACH A GOOD SHIRT OR TOWEL! (I learned that one the hard way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pull more hairs on the part and though out all the way to the middle back of my head the bottom of my hair stays my \\&quot;natural\\&quot; color and my top has golden caramel to blonde high lights through out. I do this my self with a few mirrors. I use the smaller metal pull for more natural look the other one will give you a \\&quot;chunky look.\\&quot; I have people ask me who my stylist is.  My natural color is a ash brown, to blonde. Watch the color as you process it not to over process. And when you re color DO NOT re highlight the tips that are already blonde, or you can fry your hair. Just do the roots. The avoid pain when removing the cap get into the shower rinse dye out. Then take a hand full of your own good conditioner ( I use Redkin so-soft) While the conditioner is still in slowly wiggle off the cap. once off shampoo and condition hair again. Then I put the toner in once hair is combed and out of the shower. Then Style your way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been coloring my hair with this product every 3 months for the last four years.Over all the money I have saved through out the years. Probably close to $1,200 a year!! My natural color is a ash brown, to blonde. I have been coloring my hair with this product every 3 months for the last four years</li>
    <li> Looks great and did everything it said it would do. Blends well and doesnt look unnatural. I would reccommend this to someone who just wanted to lighten up their hair but nothing too drastic.</li>
    <li> I am a natural blonde, the 1st time I used it to add a pop of very blonde in my hair I used Champagne and wasn&#x27;t happy. It&#x27;s actually sometimes harder for someone like me with dark blonde hair to lighten their hair than people with brown hair. So, next I used the Caramel, the box with purple on it... it does perfectly for me with my color. The only issue I have is that now after my 4th use, all my hair is very blonde so I will probably need to get a box of dark dye to match it to my natural color before I do any more highlights. When it comes to boxed dye get the very most expensive one. Also, with this dye save a little when you put it on your head because sometimes the front don&#x27;t turn out like I want it too and I need to do a few strands here and there to get it to what I like and I just use saran wrap or foil around those strands if I do it. I can not afford to go to the salon and I think that this product is good but do be careful and do not leave it on your hair too long.</li>
    <li> For a person who has never done this before, I was quite happy with the results from this product and recommend it for anyone wanting to frost/ add high lights to their hair. I will purchase/ use again.</li>
    <li> I have been having trouble locating this product locally - so have been ordering it on-line.  The color is perfect if you&#x27;re already a lighter shade of brunette - or if you&#x27;re a redhead like me.  The nice thing is - even if you use it all the time - and pull you hair through the cap - it covers what you&#x27;ve already done without it going that ghostly white that some of the others frosting shades do.  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add that it&#x27;s the perfect highlighting kit for redheads.  I&#x27;ve updated this review with a picture to show how great it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been reading some of the reviews and I see that some are having difficulty pulling hair thru the cap, even calling the cap flimsy. That has NOT been my experience.  A tip:  hold the pick at an almost horizontal angle and poke thru the cap, then pull out the strands of hair.  I tend to pull it out in different thicknesses in order to give the highlights a more natural look.</li>
    <li> Used on my daughter. Her hair is a darker medium brown. Left it on for the time required. Didn&#x27;t turn out caramel. Turned out almost white. Luckily it isn&#x27;t too bad, but it is definitely not caramel. If you use this and don&#x27;t want white streaks, shave up to half the time off.</li>
    <li> People at my work noticed the highlights and they thought I went to a salon to get them...haha I didn&#x27;t I told them I did them and they couldn&#x27;t believe how good they looked! only thing I recommend is that you do sides at equal times...so if you start at the bottom left...the follow with bottom right..don&#x27;t go to top left b/c then one side will be blonder than the other side. but other than that this is a great DIY highlights kit!</li>
    <li> worked great. pretty easy to do. very natural looking.</li>
    <li> Bought caramel but it turned my hair strands blonde almost white... And I didn&#x27;t leave it on for that long!</li>
    <li> I just received this today, and I decided to test one strand of hair and it came out perfect! I probably should&#x27;ve left it in a little longer for blonder hair but I really like this product.</li>
    <li> If you follow the directions to a T you will get the caramel results... also this kit has an 800 Number and you can call a professional to walk you through the process, if you have trouble understanding the directions....</li>
    <li> This kit comes with everything that you need to highlight your hair except:&lt;br /&gt;1. patience&lt;br /&gt;2. a friend to help with hard to reach areas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who has been going to salons all my life, this was not an easy transition. It is time consuming and can be quite frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the color is good, but not great.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll stick to salons or try another brand.</li>
    <li> I bougth this when I was really into coloring my hair it was UGLY. I didn&#x27;t like the way it turned out on my hair.</li>
    <li> Better than what i expected! I have really light red hair like a strawberry blonde so the carmel color mixed in looks really good and natural! I love the two different sized hooks. It is time consuming thoe and you deffinitly need someone to help you! I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> I think with any hair color you have to know what you&#x27;re doing. Trial &amp; error..For me I don&#x27;t use the cap that comes with this..I&#x27;ve been using this so long I use my hands only to apply as all over color..as soon as I put on on darker areas I jump in the shower and rinse out and proceed with shampoo/toner instructions.. Where the instructions may say 15-20..always use the included toner as instructed and never had any issues..now if I were to leave on too long it would be white..hope they never stop making this in champagne or caramel color..</li>
    <li> I liked this product. I also need to read fine print more often, but in all it was good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to $300 salon job.&lt;br /&gt;Advice though, if you have darker hair, 20 minutes is WAY too long. Id do 8-12.</li>
    <li> I have not used it yet but will as soon as I get my nerve up.  I hate to start coloring again then have to continue.  Hoping I can do a little that adds a lot of high-light.</li>
    <li> I love my new hair color frost and design is very good:)</li>
    <li> product delivered on time and produces results as expected.</li>
    <li> First let me say that I was happy with the results of this product. I have medium to dark brown hair and left it in for 25 minutes and got nice golden blonde highlights. HOWEVER, the whole process took roughly three hours and was extremely pain-staking and frustrating! Pulling the hair through all those little holes in the cap took over an hour and it was painful too! Even with my husband helping in the back, I got so frustrated I just left a bunch of holes empty and didn&#x27;t even bother. Also, there was SO much lightening cream, enough to highlight my hair at least 6 times. So it would be nice if Loreal put the ingredients in smaller packages so it could be used to highlight your hair multiple times. I&#x27;m on the hunt for an easier method of doing at-home highlights, because while the price is right for this product and the results were better than expected, I just don&#x27;t have the time or patience to deal with this again.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to use the highlighting cap as most youtube videos say not to but I love how it turned out. A week after I put this in I put in an all over blonde colour and it looks amazing! Shipping was fast as well :)</li>
    <li> Due to increasing costs I&#x27;ve starting coloring my own hair. I&#x27;ve NEVER colored hair before. The savings is significant. This kit has EVERYTHING needed, the color is perfect for my medium brown hair &amp;amp; it&#x27;s very easy to use. The hardest part is pulling my long hair through the cap, I always use the metal hook, I find it very difficult to get the plastic hook to puncture the plastic cap &amp;amp; to properly hook the hair. I don&#x27;t recommend brushing/combing hair straight back as directed in the instructions, you&#x27;ll end up not getting close to the roots. I comb my hair straight down. My hair reaches the middle of my back, there is plenty of color to do a full highlite. I do wish they&#x27;d make a kit with foils rather than the plastic cap, it&#x27;d give me more control &amp;amp; it&#x27;d be easier for long hair.</li>
