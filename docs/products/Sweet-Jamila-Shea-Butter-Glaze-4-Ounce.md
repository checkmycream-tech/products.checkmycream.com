      <li>Love this for my hair.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Just unless you have money to keep buying it, your better off making it yourself- money over time.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I wonder if there are any more products this company makes.</li>
      <li>This product was ok for my hair texture.</li>
      <li>Hair is much more manageable and makes my waves more defined.</li>
      <li>plus it shipped faster than i expected :D</li>
      <li>Smells great will buy more in the future.</li>
      <li>While not as amazing as some would say, it&#x27;s good for two main reasons - keeps hair soft, thus manageable, and adds shine.  </li>
      <li>way n leave hair soft with a nice shine to it.</li>
      <li>Hair is thoroughly Moisturized when I add the sweet jamila.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the product, thought it would be smaller</li>
      <li>for most black men hair texture this is only good if youre hair is shorter than 1.5 ....</li>
      <li>I had so many people comment on how many waves I had in such a short period of time using the product.</li>
      <li>Well at first I thought ppl may have been hyping this product up, but once I received it in the mail I tried it</li>
      <li>First time using jamila</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much!</li>
      <li>Really though, it&#x27;s nothing mind-blowing, just a blend of shea butter and essential oils; you could easily make the stuff yourself and probably save quite a bit of money.  </li>
      <li>Never paid that much for a hair product</li>
      <li>It fit the bill initially but my needs changed.</li>
      <li>Really brings out the waves.</li>
      <li>For real men.... it moisturiz my waves/hair</li>
      <li>Always sweat it out no matter how less r more I put in it</li>
      <li>Decent hold</li>
      <li>The smell is very reminiscent of bubble gum, so take that for what it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
      <li>Make waves pop lil more than usual.</li>
      <li>This product gets the job done when it comes to maintaining your natural wave pattern!</li>
      <li>It makes my kids curly hair sleek and soft, its also provides nutrients and luster.</li>

    <li> waaay to slippery and shiny, smells like bubble gum</li>
    <li> Smells just like bubble gum. Hard when you gather a dime size amount but soft when you rub your hands together. Hair is much more manageable and makes my waves more defined. Hair is thoroughly Moisturized when I add the sweet jamila. Never paid that much for a hair product but I would definitely buy again.</li>

    <li> for most black men hair texture this is only good if youre hair is shorter than 1.5 ....at a normal length this will make your hair tight..</li>
    <li> This product was ok for my hair texture. My hair is thick and coarse. It did make it softer, it did not give it shine. I&#x27;ve read some reviews where people have said this gives their hair shine, but not for me. It has a great smell to it. I feel for what it did for me that it was not worth paying for what it is priced.</li>
    <li> very good product for shine, with a very light hold and no greasy build up.</li>
    <li> Good product. Just unless you have money to keep buying it, your better off making it yourself- money over time.</li>
    <li> Very very nice the smell is great love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Caucasian male and my hair is about 4&amp;#34; long and I wear it slicked back. I ordered this after it was recommended by a friend who is a barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product held my hair great and was easy to use, smelled great, and lasted several months. As my hair began to grow longer I noticed it didn&#x27;t hold as well and I would get that one strand that would constantly come down in my face like that clown Oz in American Pie...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand this product is not a wax, which is why I rated it the way I did. It fit the bill initially but my needs changed.</li>
    <li> great product i will be getting more as soon as i run out.</li>
    <li> First time using jamila I see the different in my wave pattern Adds shine keep my hair manageable non greasy no build up I will buy again no question ask</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the product, thought it would be smaller so I&#x27;m very happy!! Will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> The product was perfect. Delivery was excellent. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Its amazing when your hair is lower, but during wolfing, this tends to tighten my hair up which leads to forks in my hair. It does have a good amount of hold though.</li>
    <li> Love it. Have been using it for over 3 years. Really brings out the waves. Great for the skin too</li>
    <li> This is a good product!!! For real men.... it moisturiz my waves/hair In it..</li>
    <li> Always sweat it out no matter how less r more I put in it</li>
    <li> This is a hair dressing product that does a good job of keeping your hair moisturized throughout the day. It works just as good as pure argan oil and it smells good, too! It wont give you waves and it doesn&#x27;t hold as well as a pomade, though. It&#x27;s also really expensive.</li>
    <li> This product is good for adding shine and definition to already formed waves. Wll NOT give you waves if you don&#x27;t. Already brush regularly</li>
    <li> love it good for skin and hair</li>
    <li> This stuff smells sooooo good! And it&#x27;s good for my hair and skin</li>
