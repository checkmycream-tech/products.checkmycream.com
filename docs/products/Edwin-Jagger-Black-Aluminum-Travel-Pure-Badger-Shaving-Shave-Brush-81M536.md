### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best thing about the brush is how convenient it is to travel with.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The unit is well made, compact and perfect for travel.</li>
      <li>It is, however, an excellent travel brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Perfect travel shaving brush.</li>
      <li>I think it is perfect.  </li>
      <li>Great Brush &amp; Perfect Size for Travel.</li>
      <li>If you travel a lot, but still like a blade shave, this is great.</li>
      <li>Edwin Jagger makes great products</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a good brush for the road, this is the one.</li>
      <li>If you want to keep that great clean-shaved feeling just as nice on the road as it is at home, this is the ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
      <li>The brush is great, and even though the body is very light, its shape and length make using the brush very easy (making circles and whatnot).</li>
      <li>Brush is very good for a pure badger brush - not as pliable as a best badger or silver tip but more comfortable than a boar brush.</li>
      <li>Collapses nicely into its own handle.</li>
      <li>Dries quickly, like most badgers do, which makes it ideal for travelling.</li>
      <li>not horribly so if you it damp</li>
      <li>Had it almost a year and many 10s of thousands of miles of travel.</li>
      <li>Works great, dries fast.  </li>
      <li>I love it for traveling.</li>
      <li>Still love it.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>(although I like to let it air-dry if I have the time), is soft yet rugged, and holds and spreads cream beautifully.  </li>
      <li>A great brush for those who prefer the old school DE shaving method while on the go.</li>
      <li>Dries very quick after each use.</li>
      <li>It drains and dries well and is easy to assemble/disassemble.</li>
      <li>Bristles are as good as my regular brush, and the neat way it packs up makes packing very easy.</li>
      <li>This one has been moving around with me for a few trips, and is still in excellent condition.  </li>
      <li>Still in fantastic shape.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>When disassembled, the whole brush top fits into the handle, which makes for easy packing into your dopp kit.</li>
      <li>Compact, soft and comfortable, this brush stows perfectly and does not fall apart after several uses.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product and outperforms my other brushes.  </li>
      <li>It dries fairly quickly and I didn&#x27;t notice any moisture leaking into my dopp kit.</li>
      <li>The design is very innovative, which is what initially attracted me to this brush.</li>
      <li>Light weight, easy to use, fast lather, dries very fast.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>It is certainly worth it.  </li>
      <li>This brush has outlived and outperformed the others — both much more expensive — by a substantial margin, and it&#x27;s still as perfect as when new.  </li>
      <li>And you don&#x27;t have to worry about ruining any of your good everyday brushes for home use.</li>
      <li>Good soap, very tight so no leaks there, either.</li>
      <li>I travel pretty much monthly</li>
      <li>but I have found it works exceptionally well with hard shave soaps (I use a D.H. Harris stick when traveling) more so than my daily brush.</li>
      <li>While its light weight was a bit disconcerting at first, it ultimately is an advantage, with airlines now charging for every additional ounce.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very particular about shaving brushes.</li>
      <li>It has never dropped a bristle, dries very well in its ventilated container</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>and I enjoy having the ability to work up a proper lather when shaving.</li>
      <li>Very well made</li>
      <li>This is very well constructed brush and the aluminum case/handle travel compactly and well.</li>
      <li>Could easily be used all the time but the ability to break it down makes it just right for you travel kit.</li>
      <li>Really provides a nice thick lather.</li>
      <li>I recommend that when you are storing it at home before your next trip, you leave it assembled and open to make sure that there&#x27;s no residual moisture in the bristles.</li>
      <li>but I find that is very normal for a new brush.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This handy little travel brush makes that possible.</li>
      <li>In the past I have bought travel brushes from both of the famous London stores that specialize in shaving equipment.</li>
      <li>But when I get home from a trip I clean my brush with Dazzle Soap (The low residue stuff you use to clean baby bottles) and then soak it in 20/80 solution of water and white vinegar for ten minutes and let it air dry disassembled overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This brush is far softer on the face than the T man.</li>
      <li>The bristles are ordinary \\&quot;pure badger\\&quot; and not the more luxurious silvertip; as a result I find that I have to load it with water a second time while using it because it doesn&#x27;t hold quite enough water by itself.</li>
      <li>I find the small size and physical strength of this Jagger brush to be outstanding.</li>
      <li>It certainly lives up to the quality expected out of an Edwin Jagger model.</li>
      <li>I guess third time&#x27;s a charm for me, because I threw the first two brushes away when the bristles started coming out after only a few uses.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fantastic product.  I am thinking about getting another for myself and some for gifts to friends</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll have to ask your mate how close the shave.  Nothing but compliments on the results.</li>
    <li> If you travel a lot, but still like a blade shave, this is great. Bristles are as good as my regular brush, and the neat way it packs up makes packing very easy. I worried about it draining water into the travel kit but it doesn&#x27;t.  Very well made so it provides a firm hold. Definitely worth the price. Had it about a year and no signs of deterioration.      I would also order the Col Ichabod travel soap dish. Good soap, very tight so no leaks there, either.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not immediately obvious from the pictures how this thing works (or even from the reviews I read). It comes in 3 parts that screw together, all aluminum, black oxide finish. The brush screws into the end piece, which screws onto the body. For travel, the brush slides into the body and you screw the end piece on, which leaves a hole for the longest bristles and for some airflow. It&#x27;s all manual, no springs or extra junk that could break. The brush is great, and even though the body is very light, its shape and length make using the brush very easy (making circles and whatnot).</li>
    <li> Great Brush &amp; Perfect Size for Travel. Dries very quick after each use. Really provides a nice thick lather. Edwin Jagger makes great products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very particular about shaving brushes. In the past I have bought travel brushes from both of the famous London stores that specialize in shaving equipment. I find the small size and physical strength of this Jagger brush to be outstanding. The bristles are ordinary \\&quot;pure badger\\&quot; and not the more luxurious silvertip; as a result I find that I have to load it with water a second time while using it because it doesn&#x27;t hold quite enough water by itself. Hey, it&#x27;s a travel brush. I can cope. And if for some reason I have to wing it using a bar of hotel soap for shaving, the increased rigidity of the pure-badger bristles makes that easier than if I had a softer brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to let the bristles dry out as much as possible before packing it up to go back in my suitcase. Sometimes that just isn&#x27;t possible. The open-end design lets it do a bit of drying even when it&#x27;s packed up. I recommend that when you are storing it at home before your next trip, you leave it assembled and open to make sure that there&#x27;s no residual moisture in the bristles.</li>
    <li> Works great, dries fast.  The only complaint is it is not black like the picture, it is silver.  Still love it.</li>
    <li> Perfect travel shaving brush. Highly recommended! Could easily be used all the time but the ability to break it down makes it just right for you travel kit.</li>
    <li> This is not something I would use on a daily basis since the brush is a little scratchy and rather thin. It is, however, an excellent travel brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well designed to drain, can be assembled and broken down quickly and is compact when broken down. I am glad that I no longer have to sacrifice my expensive badge brush when travelling.</li>
    <li> The best thing about the brush is how convenient it is to travel with. My wife got it for me after hearing me complain about traveling with a regular brush which is too bulky. It&#x27;s a little awkward to hold when using, but overall I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> A great brush for those who prefer the old school DE shaving method while on the go. Collapses nicely into its own handle. Solid aluminum construction. Had it almost a year and many 10s of thousands of miles of travel. Still in fantastic shape.</li>
    <li> Light weight, easy to use, fast lather, dries very fast.  This is a small brush designed for travel, that might take a little while to get used too.  I have used it on a cruise, and on a couple of week long road trips.  I think it is perfect.  I have lost a few hairs but I find that is very normal for a new brush.</li>
    <li> A wet-shavers must have if you travel for business or pleasure or both. I had my doubts, but Edwin Jagged came through once again. If you want to keep that great clean-shaved feeling just as nice on the road as it is at home, this is the ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, yet takes up very little space. And you don&#x27;t have to worry about ruining any of your good everyday brushes for home use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and outperforms my other brushes.  It&#x27;s a bit hard to pack it into the handle w/o out bristles getting caught but not horribly so if you it damp and I&#x27;m patient.  I love it for traveling.</li>
    <li> I travel quite frequently, and have had at least three travel brushes in the past two years.  This brush has outlived and outperformed the others — both much more expensive — by a substantial margin, and it&#x27;s still as perfect as when new.  It has never dropped a bristle, dries very well in its ventilated container (although I like to let it air-dry if I have the time), is soft yet rugged, and holds and spreads cream beautifully.  While its light weight was a bit disconcerting at first, it ultimately is an advantage, with airlines now charging for every additional ounce.  And one gets to feel a bit like one of those spies with a transformable device when screwing it together.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is very well constructed brush and the aluminum case/handle travel compactly and well. Brush is very good for a pure badger brush - not as pliable as a best badger or silver tip but more comfortable than a boar brush. Dries quickly, like most badgers do, which makes it ideal for travelling. When disassembled, the whole brush top fits into the handle, which makes for easy packing into your dopp kit. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am a soldier, and I must travel a lot. This thing lets me bring my gourmet shave where ever I go. I use a Tweezerman daily, and this when I travel. This brush is far softer on the face than the T man. I love it. The design is very innovative, which is what initially attracted me to this brush.</li>
    <li> I travel pretty much monthly and I enjoy having the ability to work up a proper lather when shaving. This handy little travel brush makes that possible. It drains and dries well and is easy to assemble/disassemble.</li>
    <li> Out of the box the brush has a musty &amp;#34;badger smell&amp;#34; but I used the brush in place of my silvertip for a week and the smell decreased considerably. Since the brush is screwed atop the carrying tube it can be a bit awkward to maneuver around your face but I got used to it. The brush head is small but I have found it works exceptionally well with hard shave soaps (I use a D.H. Harris stick when traveling) more so than my daily brush. I think that might have something to do with the firmer bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is well made, compact and perfect for travel. It dries fairly quickly and I didn&#x27;t notice any moisture leaking into my dopp kit. But when I get home from a trip I clean my brush with Dazzle Soap (The low residue stuff you use to clean baby bottles) and then soak it in 20/80 solution of water and white vinegar for ten minutes and let it air dry disassembled overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for a good brush for the road, this is the one.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a travel brush for some time, and went through two others before spending a little extra and getting this one. It is certainly worth it.  Compact, soft and comfortable, this brush stows perfectly and does not fall apart after several uses.  I guess third time&#x27;s a charm for me, because I threw the first two brushes away when the bristles started coming out after only a few uses.  This one has been moving around with me for a few trips, and is still in excellent condition.  It certainly lives up to the quality expected out of an Edwin Jagger model.</li>
    <li> After one year some of the glue is oozing out and it&#x27;s starting to shed bristles. Not impressive.</li>
