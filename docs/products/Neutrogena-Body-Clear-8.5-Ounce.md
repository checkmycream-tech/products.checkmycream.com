      <li>The scent is VERY light once rinsed and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I discovered this body wash when I was on the HCG diet as it recommended using all natural oil free body wash.  I really love it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. One the first product I have ever used that has been so effective from day one.  It started working on clearing my skin from day one basically and still do. I love the scent as well. Really nice.   Even being a man didn&#x27;t mind the fragrance it had lol :)</li>
    <li> I bought this product, because I was suddenly breaking out on my back and the reviews were good, but like every product out there, it depends on the person. It smells good and lathers really well, but I have already used half the bottle and it made me break out even more. I would not recommend this at all. Now that it&#x27;s hot, I can&#x27;t even wear tank tops anymore. Be careful before you buy.</li>
    <li> I hate that this product is difficult to find.  I love the smell and it does a a decent job of keeping my skin clear.  I know that other reviews say it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original, but the smell of the original is just to medical for me.  I love this stuff and will use it forever.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  I would sometimes have problems with breakouts on my shoulder, back, and chest areas as well as my face.  I saw a commercial for proactiv body wash on tv and thought about ordering it; but the price was so high for just a small bottle.  I saw this product at Walmart and decided to get some to try.  I loved it and it works!! Now I have it delivered directly to my door automatically with Amazon subscribe and save.  It&#x27;s as good or better then proavtiv at less then half the price and double the size bottle.</li>
    <li> Works pretty darn well. Better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before... including the regular Neutrogena Body Wash.     I thought the Pink Grapefruit was just a scent, and being a guy, in a choice between grapefruit scent or not, I&#x27;ll take not, but apparently it is not just a scent. The pink grapefruit body wash worked where the regular wash did not.</li>
    <li> This body wash is an excellent product.  I use it from head to toe, and even use it to wash my hair (all 1/4 of it).  It leaves a clean, fresh, and balanced feeling.  And, it&#x27;s a critical part of my acne regimen.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give lather. No specific aroma. Is it just another soap or what?&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, Not a fan!&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have moderate chest and back acne that I&#x27;ve had a hard time keeping clear.  I decided to try this product, but it actually caused me to break out MORE after I started using it.  In fact, I used it for about 6 days and watched as my acne got progressively worse and worse.  It also made my skin very oily, and I was getting all kinds of acne I never got before.  And for the record, I don&#x27;t have incredibly oily skin to begin with...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would not recommend.  For the future, I will look at a stronger acne wash, something with benzoyl peroxide.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic! Delicious-smelling magic. I have had a skin condition known as \\&quot;Keratosis Pilaris\\&quot; or \\&quot;KP\\&quot; since around puberty; I am now a 25 year old woman. I would hide my arms and when I did show them people would constantly ask me if I had goosebumps (always confusing in the 100°+ summers) or pimples. It was embarrassing and something I was told by dermatologists to get used to, I had even used a prescription lotion for a while but effects dried out my skin too much too quickly. My boyfriend would start picking at the little bumps and they were driving me crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNTIL...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This amazing Grapefruit Body Wash! (Man, do I sound like an infomercial or what!?) Within 2 washes on a loofa, I noticed a difference in my upper arms, all over: front/back/side. Probably 10%. And now finishing my 2nd bottle, they are 90% gone! That is amazing. As long as I keep it up and don&#x27;t stop using it for too many days in a row, my skin stays so smooth and NOT bumpy. It also smells REALLY good (I recommend getting the Grapefruit Face Wash too, but never get it in your eye- It&#x27;s a firey mess.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have eczema on my legs especially when the weather changes and the body wash even helps with that! I notice I&#x27;m not as itchy and the little bumps the eczema causes go way down or disappear, too. I had recently developed a little bit of stubborn acne on my back and this quickly and completely erased ALL of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend uses it now too so it&#x27;s Gender-Friendly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I&#x27;ve bought it for over $8 or $9 at CVS. This Amazon price of $6.39 would save you a few bucks.</li>
    <li> Good-  Smells great  Helps to clear acne  Goes a long way    Bad-  Does dry out skin    I would recommend using it maybe every other day</li>
    <li> This is pretty good, however, it barely makes any foam so you need to use a lot of it when you take a shower, and since the bottle is so small it will last you about a week for just one person.</li>
    <li> This body clear body wash really works! Smells good as well. Recommend it to those who have back acnes like my hubby. I don&#x27;t have body acnes, but I tired it and I felt my skin became more smooth.</li>
    <li> Of course the product won&#x27;t work over night, but by the time half of the bottle was gone, it 95% of my bacne was gone! I love the smell; it actually does smell like grapefruit, which was wasn&#x27;t completely expecting.  I&#x27;ve had bumps on my arms for as long as I can remember (didn&#x27;t look like pimples) and after being told by my mother that there wasn&#x27;t anything to remove them, I was pleasantly surprised when this actually started clearing them up!    Just wish it had cleared up my chest acne a little quicker.   I DEFINITELY recommend this body wash. It really is amazing.</li>
    <li> It has a clean, pleasant enough smell that didn&#x27;t linger very long on my skin, so that was a plus. I also have fairly sensitive skin, but it never once irritated it or dried it out.  As for how well it worked as a body acne fighter? Within just a few days of using it I broke out in places that I never had pimples before. I can&#x27;t say that was much of a surprise, as cleansers bring oil and dirt to the surface and I fully expected the acne problem to temporarily get worse before it got better. However, this problem didn&#x27;t even begin to be rectified until more than halfway through the bottle. After the entire bottle had been used up the new acne brought on by this product&#x27;s use was gone, yes, but the old acne wasn&#x27;t as cleared as I would have liked.  In the end it&#x27;s an okay acne fighter, nothing I would rave about. It helped the pimples on my back to a certain degree, but not entirely.</li>
    <li> This lathers up very well - is nice and thick - and smells wonderful!!! I can&#x27;t speak to the skin clearing as we purchased this for the grapefruit fragrance.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It smells wonderful, and it&#x27;s extra foamy. My back was breaking out from my other body wash, but I switched to this one and now it&#x27;s under control.</li>
    <li> Smells good.  The other body washes by neutrogena (orange ones) actually give off a medical body odor smell that literally smells soury after a while and gross.  They also stain your shower curtains and shower.  Overrall this ones way better cause it smells natural and basically does the same job.  I havent noticed any staining yet.  I will however say to neutrogena, WTH happened to the green cream microclear body wash??  That stuff worked wonders on my back and they discontinued it.  Anyways, this stuff does pretty good on my back but not as good as the microclear green body wash.</li>
    <li> The miracle posts are right, this really did clear away the mild persistent body acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a small bottle, but a little goes a long way. Smells like grapefruit, and I hate grapefruit, but I like this. The scent is VERY light once rinsed and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited at the thought this may become my first amazon subscription product. I&#x27;ll let you know how long a single man can expect to go through these things once I do.</li>
    <li> didnt help my back acne, but great smell and it did make me feel really clean.</li>
    <li> It got me clean and left me smelling grapefruit-y fresh - what&#x27;s not to love? A bit on the pricey side, but definitely helped keep my skin clear.</li>
    <li> This body wash was exactly what I was looking for. I don&#x27;t have horrible body acne or anything, I just occasionally get break outs when it&#x27;s hot and humid outside, or if I&#x27;ve been working out profusely. Once I started a running program, I bought this body wash and I haven&#x27;t had a break out yet! It smells soooo good too. I loved the face wash and was happy to see that they made a body wash in the same scent. I probably will not use any other body wash again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wash for at least 3 weeks now, and instead of working as promised, my minimal acne turned into big red zits in my back and chest and multiplied the smaller zits. It does smell very good, though.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be okay; I didn&#x27;t get all those dramatic results most of the reviews did.  I guess in terms of my skin, it would be oily.  I&#x27;m in my early 20s and in the last year, I decided to try to get rid of the acne on my back and chest after usually being focused on my face.  One bottle lasts a little over a month since I just used it on my back and chest. When I first used it I was pleased, I was no longer breaking out but my previous scars didn&#x27;t really seem to be clearing.  When I got to the last third of the bottle, I started breaking out again.  Over time, it did leave my skin smooth (besides the random breakout bumps) and creates this \\&quot;semi-shine\\&quot; that I was pleased with. The shine is similar to the results you would get from using a drop of baby oil. Bought a second bottle, but I never got the non-breakout results I did the first time I bought it.  I decided to start washing 2x a day, but at night I use Dove to avoid serious dryness.  After about 2 weeks, it hasn&#x27;t helped in terms of no breakouts and my skin isn&#x27;t has smooth so I&#x27;ll stop using the Dove. I could see clearing start but I knew it would be a long-term thing before I received good results.  I do have to apply a little moisturizer about once a week for dryness.  I&#x27;ll prolly continue using it, until I find a replacement that has real clearing results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have always had a problem with my arms breaking out. I have tried many different body washes and this one is the only one that has worked! It smells great and makes my skin smooth. This is a must have!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and it has absolutely made no difference. I&#x27;m Asian and I have acne on both my chest and back. It didn&#x27;t make my skin worse, but nevertheless I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had a very minor break out on my shoulders. The beads are magical, and do not get me started on the smell. I loved this body wash, and it helped clear up my shoulders tremendously. For the price in comparison to other products, you can not beat it! Clear and delicious smelling skin?! Sign me up!</li>
    <li> I received this order about a week ago and I wanted to try it out before writing a review and I have to say it worked very well and actually better than I expected the only thing is that it dries out you skin. But after use I would put on a moisturizer and they seem to work perfectly together and at first a had acne on my thigh and after one use I could see and feel it shrink some and after another was it got even smaller till it disappered.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but I think their other body wash worked a little better for back acne. The smell is kind of funky too.. not a big fan.</li>
    <li> I do not hate the product, however I went under my account to order this with my other products assuming this was part of the monthly ordering process. I did not like the fact that it was not under the prime account and I paid an unbelievable amount of shipping. I do think it was almost as much as the product. This is not what I signed up for.</li>
    <li> I am currently out of the us and in a location that does not carry this product. I order it whenever I get a chance which is rare. It keeps my skin clear without over drying. I workout a lot and sweat a lot so it keeps body acne down</li>
    <li> This showed results after using it only once! Love it! highly recommend, must use it religiously for the best results :)</li>
    <li> This smells of grapefruit, which I find very refreshing.  My husband is prone to acne and he finds this product keeps it under control better than Proactive!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin so I have to be careful about what products I use when I have breakouts on my body (notably my shoulders and back).  My dermatologists recommended that I try the Neutrogrena Body Clear Body Wash, Pink Grapefruit for when I broke out.  She was adamant that I did not use it on a daily basis because my sensitive skin and she is right! This body wash is great for when you breakout during the summer months- the salicylic acid treats your pimples.  It does so quickly and without much irritation to my sensitive skin.  However, I thought because it was rather gentle when I did breakout that I could use it on a daily basis- WRONG.  After using it for about 5 days in a row, my skin was extremely irritated and very dry.  I would recommend that sensitive skin people only use this product when they breakout or KNOW they are going to breakout, otherwise it will dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve been away at college I&#x27;ve been really stressed and breaking out more, especially on my back.  I&#x27;d never really had issues with body acne so I wasn&#x27;t sure how to deal with it, and I saw this stuff at CVS and tried it.  It hasn&#x27;t cleared anything up and, before I used the wash, I had no blemishes on my chest.  After quickly running the wash over my chest in the shower, I now have 3 very visible pimples on my chest.  I&#x27;ve never had acne there before so I think it&#x27;s safe to assume it was caused by this acne wash.  What kind of acne product leaves you with more acne??  Don&#x27;t bother with this one.</li>
    <li> Been using this for my back and I believed it helped. I recently combined the use of this with applying apple cider vinegar and tea tree oil for my back acne (acute). Sad that it is no longer available for subscription.</li>
    <li> I have mild back-acne and most activities I do require no shirt, beach, swim, ect. I have been using this for about 4 months and it works WONDERS! only reason I ordered is because Im deployed now and they dont have it here. But I love this stuff. clear back for 4 months straight!</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  Did a great job clearing up my back with ache.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about body wash except that it gets you clean.  However, this one has tiny little scrubber grains in it so it exfoliates too.  Smells good.</li>
    <li> Love Neutragena products. The only thing im not happy with this body wash is it is very drying. Supplier could have advertised more descriptively. Meaning it should have said that this product was an acne wash instead of a &amp;#34;Rainbath&amp;#34; product. Gave away to someone with body acne.</li>
    <li> I really loved this product, the smell is really good and the skin feels really soft and clean after using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a couple months ago, I have minor blemishes on my upper shoulders and lower back. The smell of this product is wonderful. And It suds and has micro beads that feel great even if you are using your hand. I bought a back scrubber and used this every day for a month and a half now (still having a lot more washes to the bottle) and there has not been much change. Some will go away, new ones will pop up regardless of use. But over all this wash just make you feel clean and smell great.</li>
    <li> The beads make you feel super clean and the scent is really addicting. Depending on your climate, it can dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> I am skeptical of products like this. however i was pleasantly surprised. i am a 20 year old man, and got this product primarily to try and help my shoulder and back acne. While it&#x27;s not a miracle wash that gets rid off all of your acne, for me it has reduced the number of new breakouts and the acne is much smaller. Also, this wash gives you an incredible clean. Hope this helps as i was very on the fence about trying this product. For the price its certainly worth a try</li>
    <li> Lovin the grapefruit scrub, and it does help with the body acne. Love the smell, the texture beads, and the clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I am a hormonally challenged female and have been suffering from bacne lately, though it isn&#x27;t typical. I decided to go ahead and try this body wash to see if it would help. What do you know -- just a day later and it was working quite well! I still have little blackheads, but no more big, really noticeable zits. I combined it with a really great exfoliating loofah and the skin on my back has gotten much better. It does smell pretty gross though - my husband thought he smelled something rank this morning in the shower, but I told him it was probably the body wash and when he sniffed it he confirmed. If you can deal with the smelliness while you&#x27;re washing then it&#x27;s worth it. I don&#x27;t find that it leaves a residual smell at all.</li>
    <li> Disappointed that it has the tiny plastic beads in it. Will not buy again because of this.</li>
    <li> There has to be a better way to seal this before you ship it.  My son said that the body wash was all over the place.  He loves the product, but it should not be all over the place when you open the package.  You all do sell it for much more than local stores, which I can get it for $7.  My son needed it quick so I went through Amazon.  I wont do that again.</li>
    <li> My main purpose of using this was to control acne on my face and body.  I used to have a lot of it, but not so much as I got older.  Especially not so much since I moved from Hawaii (humid) to Colorado (dry), but still, every bit helps.  I still get the occasional pimple here and there, but I can live with that.  I&#x27;m not sure if this product is actually helping with the acne or not, or if it really is the drier climate and the lower amount of hormones I&#x27;m producing as I get older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, one area where this did help me was with a scalp infection.  I think I picked it up on a business trip to Santa Cruz (all hotels there are pretty filthy, I&#x27;ve been there multiple times to different ones).  I went to the doctor 2 or 3 times, and also a dermatologist several times, tried various antibiotics, creams, oral drugs, anti fungus, you name it.  I even went on Accutane for 5 months (which by the way worked GREAT while I was on it, but stopped working after I got off).  It was expensive, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So one day I decided to shampoo with this body wash, and I have been doing that ever since (probably a couple of years now).  It keeps the red bumps on my scalp in check, so I&#x27;m a subscriber.</li>
    <li> At 26 I still struggle with acne.  I&#x27;ve been using the acne wash for my face since high school and every time I stop using my face becomes covered in red dots.  I&#x27;ve always had quite a bit of acne on my chest and back and after about 4 weeks of using this product the breakouts cleared and now stay away.  I still have acne, but I got rid of my red skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for about a week and I can already see a difference in my skin. Smells really good too.</li>
    <li> This actually helps with the acne I got on my back. I highly recommend it. I no longer have back acne or bumps.&lt;br /&gt;This body wash and loofah does magic!</li>
    <li> It smells great! I love Grapefruit!!! I can feel it working, and it keeps my back and chest clear! It makes my skin feel clean and I am excited to keep using it! I love, love, love ITTT!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Every once in a while I suffer from mild breakouts on my upper chest/back and shoulders, and this is the standby product I keep around that I know for sure will take care of it.  It&#x27;s every bit as effective as the original formula, it lathers up nicely, rinses clean, and smells like a dream (unlike the original, which almost made me gag) I&#x27;m always craving grapefruit juice by the time I&#x27;m finished my shower.  It starts healing the breakouts within a day or two, and after about 5 days I&#x27;m totally clear.  Just a great, reliable product, one of very few I keep coming back to again and again.</li>
    <li> This is the only body wash that has cleared up my skin. My breakouts are slowly going away. I have used this for two months now. I plan on to buy more. It smells great too. :D</li>
    <li> I love this product. Skin feels and smells great. I purchased for a diet that does not allow one to use soap. I will continue to use it long after I through with the diet.</li>
    <li> My main reason for purchasing this product was because I would get slight acne on my shoulders/upper back region when working out. I think mainly due to taking higher amounts of protein. This body wash works wonders by removing acne in the specified areas and also prevents further breakouts. Very cheap solution/good solution for people with mild amounts of acne like me. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I have always had bad acne on my back and this body wash has dramatically improved it, plus its smells delicious! Of course there are many other treatments out there that will work just as well, but will they be as cheap?! I only paid $6 on Amazon which is amazing value for such great results! I recommend you at least give it a try!</li>
    <li> * The Neutrogena Cleanser worked fine, but I found it a little to strong for my skin, would like to try the Aloe version  * My Boyfriend likes it for the acne he gets on his back  * A great buy for the price!</li>
    <li> I love this shower gel not just for its acne treatment qualities, but it also smells great and feels good to bath with it.    It does not dry your skin like other acne treatment products, especially ones that are benzoyl peroxide based. They really dry your skin and have less results.    With Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash I feel very refreshed, acne has gone with very few breakouts sometimes. I had a problem on my back.</li>
    <li> Okay I got this cause i have chest, back &amp; sholder acne. It cleared up about 70% works really good, but could be better. I also bought the spray which is amazing and cleared up even more. So if you buy this buy the spray a great pair. I wish it was a miracle product for me but sadly it isn&#x27;t but its a great product &amp; smells amazing! My back is trouble some &amp; still hasn&#x27;t cleared up much /: best of luck to you!</li>
    <li> Daily used in the shower. I also use it on my face. Love the scent, and it helps to control my acne-prone skin. It does not make my skin sensitive.</li>
    <li> I usually have sensitive skin; one of the few scented products I can still use is body wash (probably because you rinse it off right after you apply it). I don&#x27;t really have issues with body acne, and never have, but I did have some issues with the appearance of the skin on my upper arms. I figured a body wash of this type would be less likely to aggravate the skin, and might actually lead to an improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance (for example, by killing bacteria on the skin&#x27;s surface). First I tried the regular (orange-colored and unscented) Neutrogena Body Clear wash and it didn&#x27;t really do all that much for me. The grapefruit wash was a different story. In combination with some Amlactin body lotion, this stuff has made a huge difference in the appearance of the skin on my upper arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happen to like the fragrance, although I understand that&#x27;s going to differ from person to person. (If you want to know what your own reaction will be, go sniff some in a drugstore before buying!) Because this does contain some plant extracts, colors, and fragrances, it may not be ideal for people who have reacted to other products with the same ingredients (listed below for reference):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients: Salicylic Acid (2%) (Acne Treatment)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients: Water, Sodium C14 16 Olefin Sulfonate, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Acrylates Crosspolymer, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Polyquaternium 7, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Roman Chamomile) Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Carrageenan (Chondrus Crispus), Agar, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C), Propylene Glycol, C12 15 Alkyl Lactate, Polysorbate 20, Alumina, Butylene Glycol, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Benzalkonium Chloride Solution, Sodium Benzotriazole Butylphenol Sulfonate, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides, Red 30 (CI 73360), Red 40 Lake (CI 16035), Violet 2, Mica, Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the negative reviews have me puzzled. While I don&#x27;t dispute that someone might have an allergy to one of the ingredients or a sensitivity to salicylic acid, I&#x27;d like to set the record straight about a couple of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this is a body wash and should be treated as such. This means washing it off in the shower or bath after applying it (and not leaving it on and letting it dry). It is not a spray or a cream. It does not contain any ingredients that cause bleaching effects (I have a PhD in biochemistry and write patent applications for a living so I am familiar with the ingredients and what they do). It is not difficult to get the last portion out of the container; simply store the container upside down when you are getting near the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I am quite happy with this body wash as it is having the intended effect in my case. I will purchase more when my current bottle is used up.(CI 16035), Violet 2, Mica, Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the negative reviews have me puzzled.

    <li> Helps take care of the nasty backnce and keeps my skin fresh and smooth. Must use if you have breakouts.</li>
    <li> The scent is great.  The results are average.  I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and still get light acne on the back.  I use this twice a day, once in the morning and once after the gym.  Haven&#x27;t noticed overwhelming improvement thus far.  I will likely try another bottle, as summer is approaching and that is when it can be the worse.  If it gets me through the summer then I&#x27;ll bump this product up another star.  Also, 8.5 oz is a bit small.</li>
    <li> Good smell and excellent price. It leaves you feeling clean. I would recommend it to everyone. Excellent Product. Thank You</li>
    <li> This works, but if I stop using it my bacne comes back again &#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and if you keep using it, it actually will work!</li>
    <li> There are more expensive body washes...this one is not only a good buy...and delivered right to my door...sweet...it&amp;#34;s refreshing and I love the scent.</li>
    <li> Title pretty much says it. I have oily prone skin over here and this did nothing but make my body breakout more.</li>
    <li> I used to have really awful acne on my shoulders, but this body wash stopped it in its tracks.  I really like how concentrated it is, it makes a bottle last a long time. The only down side I have found is that it can be a little bit drying. I have to have lotion around in case I get a little too dry.  Quite honestly I would rather have my skin be a little on the dry side and not have awful pimples on my back and shoulders.  I love this stuff and will continue to use it as long as my skin likes it.</li>
    <li> I was worried this would be too drying but it is gently, nicely foaming, and has a great (but not to girly) scent.</li>
    <li> This smells just like the original kind, but it is not grainy feeling at all. I like the grainy feeling because it feels like its scrubbing your skin. This is mostly liquid with some beads in it but you cant feel them at all. It works, but i still prefer the original kind to the body kind.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first.  But I have used it consistently for the last 6 months and my &#x27;body acne&#x27; is gone.  I would always have 3-4 pimples on my back, shoulders, neck or chest.  Now I have zero.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decent. Not too good at exfoliation however the smell is refreshing and citrus. It did help with back acne somewhat.</li>
    <li> Someone suggested I use this product as I occasionally get acne outbreaks on my chest and upper back due most likely to the supplements I take for gym. Nothing serious, just the occasional zit here and there, although the last month, due to the new supplement I&#x27;m taking, I&#x27;ve broken out more than normal. I started using this product and at first didn&#x27;t notice any results. After two weeks, however, I began noticing a lessening of zits on my chest and back. They&#x27;re totally gone as of this writing, although there are a couple of red spots remaining here and there. It might not work for everyone, but it&#x27;s working for me so far. The thing about these products is it&#x27;s mostly trial-and-error; what works for one might not work for another.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this. I can&#x27;t say about its effectiveness, but I would think it is pretty good (not miraculous). Just buy it for the smell if you&#x27;re in doubt.</li>
    <li> Was recommended this product by a dr. It smells really great and leaves you feeling clean. I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in acne on my arms, shoulders and back since starting to use this in September.</li>
    <li> Makes you smell good. Did help with acne on my body.. a bit. It&#x27;s good though, try it. You might really like it and your not risking a lot of cash.</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars because at first I didn&#x27;t think it helped the acne on my upper back and shoulder area at all. Now that I&#x27;m  close to done with the bottle, I think it did a bit. I still get acne, but I think there&#x27;s a slight, noticeable decrease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s pretty expensive for the size you get, and getting a body wash that only slightly decreased my bacne feels like getting a toothpaste that only kind of prevents cavities. For me, it was a bit of an all or nothing deal. Either this helped to get rid of it, or it isn&#x27;t of much use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grapefruit scent really is nice though. And I&#x27;m a straight male.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wash for years since I have sensitive skins and my back breaks out bad.  I use to use the regular wash but when the grapefruit scent came out, I&#x27;ve been hooked.  I love the fresh scent of grapefruit which is a great smell to help wake you up in the shower in the morning.  Also, as I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena since I was a teenager (like 15 years now)...I am a huge fan of this wash and works great!  I rarely break out and I attribute it to Neutrogena.  The price on Amazon is comparatively priced to my local box stores but I have Prime so it&#x27;s a nice now to able to buy and have shipped directly to my house without having to make a special trip to the boxed stores.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I exercise a lot and have been getting acne on my back this summer.  I noticed a significant improvement after I started using this product.  I have signed up for this on \\&quot;subscribe &amp; save\\&quot; because I am so happy with the product.  It has a reshreshing grapefruit smell, not medicinal at all.  My husband has started using it in the morning.  It is a little more of a scrub, then just a shower gel, but it is not too rough.</li>
    <li> it workes realy good and it almost got rid of my acne i will continue using it so that my acne goes away which wont take long cuz there almost gone</li>
    <li> I got this because when I am weightlifting I break out on my back and neck. I use a back scrubby thingy with this \\&quot;clear body wash\\&quot; and my body acne goes away. **BEWARE** Do not overuse this all over your body. Your skin will dry out and you&#x27;ll have CRAZY itchy skin. At this time of the year (FALL and WINTER) that is not a good thing. I recommend to only use this on affected areas. Be smart and use judiciously based on your condition.</li>
    <li> Love it! If your a guy just use it. No one will smell the grapefruit after you rinse it off.</li>
    <li> I bought this about halfway through my second year of college when acne on my back had flared up worse than ever before. I am an mixed ethnicity 20 year-old with combination skin on my face. My skin type on my body honestly isn&#x27;t noteworthy, not oily or dry. I think it was stress that caused my body breakouts. Anyway, moving on. I bought this and used it daily for about two to three weeks. I used it in the shower with a loofah, and exfoliated thoroughly. A little after a week and a half of using this product my back broke out worse than it ever has before in my entire life, I had large, red, painful pimples all over my back, the worst that I had ever seen. I gave the wash another two weeks. And there was no improvement whatsoever so I kicked it to the curb. I still had a large amount left, so I guess thats a plus, it last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up switching to a regime that I have been using on my face for years now. Which is exfoliating with CLEAN &amp; CLEAR® Deep Action Exfoliating Scrub and leaving it on my skin while I shave or whatnot. So far that has greatly reduced my bodily acne except for a few small breakouts here and there. The last thing I am looking for is a method to reduce the leftover scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR I&#x27;m of mixed ethnicity with combination skin and Neutrogena Body Wash made it much much worse. If you haven&#x27;t already tried, use the regime that works for you face on your body.</li>
    <li> I like grapefruit aroma and I&#x27;m sad all the fragrance is gone immediately.  But it&#x27;s nice as a body wash.</li>
    <li> This body wash is very good for children who may have acne on their backs or chests. It is mild but very effective. You should see results after about 2 weeks. The bottle lasts about 4-6 weeks. Therefore buy 2 at once to really see the potential of the product when used over a prolonged period.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;I have been searching for a good body wash that wouldn&#x27;t tear my shoulders up, and I&#x27;ve finally found it!&lt;br /&gt;I could tell from the first couple washes that it was a keeper!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks, and I&#x27;m currently sporting acne-free shoulders (save scars) for the first time in YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;And as the bottle says, you don&#x27;t have to sacrifice an enjoyable shower with this!  It lathers very well &amp; smells good.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product, and the plain, non-grapefruit smelling kind, on and off since Junior High. I have never had super bad body acne but every once and awhile (especially when I&#x27;m more active or playing sports) I&#x27;ll have issues on my back between the shoulder blades where a sweaty sports bra rests. This soap keeps me in check. Squish some onto a back scrubbing sponge and go for it. The grapefruit smell is also nice.</li>
    <li> me deja la piel limpia y fresca ademas contiene acido salicilico que exfolia la piel y me ayuda con mi acne</li>
    <li> I used to have acnes all over my back since I have really oily skin, but after using this there are only a few left. It is also very easy to wash off and have a really nice smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve starting using this product two months ago and I love it. I&#x27;ve chosen this product for the combination of  salicylic acne treatment, micro beads, scent of grapefruit all for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I break out on my chest and back from time-to-time. I do not have severe or even moderate acne on my body. I use this product in hope that it will not get worst than I already have it. This product has kept my body acne to a minimum and has stabilized breakouts. One should keep in mind that acne will not go away instantly on first use. It takes time and patience and regular use of acne treatment products to help prevent and clear acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product with an exfoliating bath sponge. The micro beads is suppose to exfoliate and gently grind away dirt and dead skin. This is a great combination because the micro beads and the exfoliating material of the sponge gives a two effect cleansing wash. Also it creates the maximum lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I come out the shower feeling fresh and smelling like grapefruit after using this product. I use this once everyday and an 8.5 ounce container lasts me two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will continue to use it until either it gets discontinued, i find a better product, or i do not need it for its main intention, which is to clear breakouts.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena body wash anyway, and was excited to try the grapefruit.  Every time I use it, I love the fresh scent without leaving a perfume-y smell.  I live where the water is hard and this product still feels sudsy.</li>
    <li> idk what it is with me and acne but nothing helps me. if it works for you more power to you. i gave it three stars because this product might work for other people so i dont want people to sway away from it. good luck my acne going friends!!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me, made me feel slimy. I&#x27;ve been using just regular Dawn dish washing liquid and it works a lot better.</li>
    <li> I live in a very hard water area in the southern United States, in an apartment complex that does not soften water. I noticed over time that I was starting to break out on my arms. I assumed my pores were clogging from our rough water. I generally like Neutrogena products and citrus scents, so I decided to try this body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent threw me off a bit. It&#x27;s a very artificial, stale citrus/grapefruit scent. It felt like I was rubbing some sort of household cleaner on my body. I liked the microbeads in the gel, but ultimately my skin didn&#x27;t improve, so the exfoliation didn&#x27;t help. Nor did the active ingredients in the body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using about 1/3 of the bottle, I ended up giving away the rest to a friend with softer water and no body acne issues. She has no complaints as far as its effectiveness, but she agrees that it smells strange.</li>
    <li> I unfortunately forgot that I was allergic to neutrogena products and had ordered and used and broke out in a rash, but if not for that I would have loved this product. The smell is nice and it is a nice thick consistency that leaves you feeling nice and clean/refreshed.</li>
    <li> Best thing since sliced bread! :)) keeps ur skin smooth and clear! Been using this since August 2012 and its no comparison to the original. Nice clean fresh scent that would clear ur skin in a matter off days!</li>
    <li> I am somewhat new to this product. I did do research before I chose this body wash and so far I must say that it is working well and  is clearing up the break-outs on my back.</li>
    <li> I love it! It helps keep breakouts under control :) I also love the way it smells. The only thing is that I wish I could get a 44oz bottle :D haha I hate running out :/</li>
    <li> I have full of acne on my back .don&#x27;t know how is that works .seem not works on my case .so -so</li>
