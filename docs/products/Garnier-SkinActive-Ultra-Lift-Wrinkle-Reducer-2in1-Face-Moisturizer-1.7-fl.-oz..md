<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years now and it has helped me maintain good skin. I think it&#x27;s good for just about everyone, as I have friends from many different racial backgrounds and I&#x27;ve recommended it to all of them. They are pleased!</li>
    <li> I was allergic and gave it away.</li>
    <li> Decided it was time for a change in skin care products.  Glad I did.  Love this one and the price.  I have been using skin care products since the day I turned 30.  A little late I know that now.  I have used all price ranges and name brands.  I like this one and pair it up with Garnier BB cream.  It&#x27;s like the dynamic duo.</li>
    <li> This is reasonably priced yet very effective in combating inevitable aging signs.  Use it sparingly as a little goes far.  I use it morning and before bed and have gotten positive feedback from others.</li>
    <li> I tried several samples of this product before buying a full size. I am very sensitive to face cream smells and to me this had no smell at all. I love the feel of it on my skin--soft but not greasy yet moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Sister came for a visit and I tried her bottle of this product.  It feels SO good on your skin - like a cool drink of water to a tired and thirsty traveler.  Husband loves it, too.  When I alone was using it, went through a bottle every 2 months.  With husband now also using, buy one bottle per month.  Currently available as a subscribe and save item.  I do a lot of subscribe and save (so convenient) so I save 15% every time I buy.</li>
    <li> A great product which works --- not bad for the price and it lasts a long time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Garnier Ultra Lift 2 in 1 for a long time. This is the first time I bought it on Amazon. It&#x27;s just easier to click &amp;#34;buy&amp;#34; and have it shipped to me. I&#x27;m a prime member so shipping is free. I really love it because it is non-greasy and does not affect my rosacea in any way. It is a great moisturizer and it seems to help at keeping the wrinkles at bay</li>
    <li> Really makes my skin soft and easier to put on makeup.  Like the overnight cream as well.  Vey good stuff!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this in the mail...lightest feeling and yet really performed well.  Moisturized without being the least bit greasy and it lasted..didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive, acne prone, somewhat oily skin at all...this product is absolutely miraculous...i love it!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks, has an unpleasant smell, doesn NOT get rid of any wrinkles. Yet It does moisturize if you don&#x27;t mind smelling musty. Yuck! Garnier products are not good.</li>
    <li> This cream works !! I used it for two weeks morning and night and I see the difference. I am only 28 but I started to get tiny wrinkles around eyes and after using this I can just say wow . It really does work.  My wrinkles disappear  under my eyes and my face feels soft and fresh. And scent doesnt bother me, as long as its working :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now. I have extremely sensitive skin, even more so on my face, but this hasn&#x27;t given me any trouble and makes my face feel soft, smooth and much younger. It does what it&#x27;s intended to do, reduce the signs of aging without causing any more damage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different types of moisturizers.  When I first used this product I did not think it was much different, but after using it for a few weeks now I see quite a difference.  My skin is softer and smoother and the small wrinkles are less noticeable. I like the texture; it doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy.  I use it both at night and in the morning. Someone mentioned the odor, but I do not notice any type of heavy odor.</li>
    <li> This works just as well as much more expensive facial creams for smoothing lines and making skin hydrated and radiant, without being greasy.  Very impressed with this product!  I will continue purchasing it from amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product. Perfect delivery.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great for my skin. I use about a pea sized amount for my whole face and it is left moisturized but not oily and my skin does not break out from it. Have not noticed a reduction in wrinkles but I don&#x27;t have bad wrinkles to start with.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Softens skin. I don&#x27;t know how well it lifts but it feels good.</li>
    <li> Nice feel on skin.  Scent too strong.</li>
    <li> Goes on nice. Smooth. Smells good.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: no improvement in wrinkles, color or texture of my skin&lt;br /&gt;Can not wear under makeup or any other lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to put a tinTed moisturizer over it and it just pulled up. Looked like my skin was peeling off. So I had to wash my ace before putting on my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;So I only use before bed. Hoping to see some results soon. But I ordered a different product to Ty since no results yet.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many wrinkle creams and moisturizers and none have worked, many have been too thick and made my sensitive skin break out, or have been simply worthless although expensive  but this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I feel like I&#x27;ve actually seen results with fine lines, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and no break outs. It has no bad smell or stickiness and a GREAT price. I honestly thought it was going to be another waste of my time and money ( read a review in a fitness mag) and took a chance but I think I have finally found my last wrinkle cream and moisturizer. Just an FYI, I&#x27;m 40 something and have pretty good skin but the wrinkles are definitely showing and those years of tanning certainly didn&#x27;t help. I have very sensitive skin though and break out now worse than I did when I was a teen ager every now and then when super stressed and this product does not aggravate my skin. I highly recommend this product,</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that this is actually reducing any wrinkles, but I like it so have been using in place of day and night time moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use this every night.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> This is a relatively new product from Garnier and while I have not typically been the biggest fan of Garnier products (nothing bad, I just never really see them do much of anything, good or bad for me), I decided to buy this product on a whim as it appealed to my laziness of mixing a serum and facial cream into one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works with a pump and unlike many pumps allows me to see the product being pushed to the top so I don&#x27;t feel like its being wasted. The pumps come out in relatively controlled bursts so it&#x27;s hard to over pump, and the product is visibly consisting of a serum like half and a lotion like half. The instructions say to use for day and/or night, but be warned it does not have a sunscreen so it needs to be used in conjunction with a sunscreen for your day cream vs. using a day cream with a built in sunscreen already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews I have read complain about the scent, but if you have used Garnier products before and liked the citrus like scent, it&#x27;s essentially the same.  I have been using the product for the past 3 weeks and have to admit I really like the texture and feel of the product at night and find it has cut down some of my product steps. I tend to only use it in the morning when I am not getting fully dressed face wise as it is very emollient for day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it a chance if you are currently combining a serum and cream as part of your nightly routine. But for me I likely would not buy again as there are so many other products to try.&lt;br /&gt;For more reviews check out pimples and wrinkles online.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this in the mail. I have been using it about two weeks. So far I have only put in on my trouble spots, the parts of my face that are starting to show some signs of aging; nasolabial folds, cracks around lips, forehead, especially the furrow between the brows. My face looks older if I do not have enough moisture, but since it is so sensitive and acne prone I have trouble finding a good moisturizer. This moisturized pretty well, so just that alone made me look much better. I have noticed some pretty good improvement overall. My forehead looks less dry and the lines have softened, even my pores are not as noticeable, so I think the retinol part of the product helps that. My nasolabial folds and cracks around lips have softened fairly noticeably. I have another sample here so I will keep on going with it. I am hoping I will notice more improvement, but even if I do not I will probably still buy the full-size product, to maintain the results. I like being able to use some kind of retinol for the benefits, but the other brands are too harsh. This was not too bad after a few uses, it had some tingling at first now I feel no irritation, no acne breakouts either (retinol is good for acne). I usually am not a fan of Garnier, but this is a decent item for those of us that cannot afford to try the fancier stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update** Went through the second sample pack. Being able to give the product another couple of weeks has made my skin look even better. I am so happy to have been given the chance to try this. My skin actually looks dewy again. Nobody believes I am 37, I am always mistaken for 30-33( will take any years back). My skin actually looks pretty again. However, I have found if I know I am going to be in the sun for an extended period of time, I need to back the day application off to every other day or else it gets a little tingly. I do wear it every night, no matter what. I am going today to buy the full size item. If you are unsure about buying the full size product, because you have wasted money on other anti-aging items that did not work, send Garnier an email explaining you would like to buy full size, but want to try it first, they may send you some samples. I have gotten other samples this way.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me but maybe it will work on someone else.</li>
    <li> I like the way my skin feels lately since using this product. I put it on fresh out of the shower before work and it helps my make-up go on nicely. Soaks in quickly, not greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Garnier products for a while now and I love their creams? I will continue using them .</li>
    <li> I do see some improvement.  It&#x27;s not a miracle worker.  I like the container that makes it easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this Garnier serum/moisturizer. I have combination to oily skin so it is a bit rich for me to use under make-up in the day but makes a fantastic night cream for me. I wake up with refreshed, plumped up skin and since my skin is very sensitive, I&#x27;m happy to report no irritation or breakouts with this product. Really makes my skin look healthy and glowing. You only need a pea sized amount for full face coverage which makes it more economical than many other products. I definitely recommend it and have already purchased it several times.</li>
    <li> If you like strongly-scented lotions for your face, this is for you. It feels nice but there is a strong perfume smell.</li>
    <li> My skin truly has never felt so good. My makeup goes on easier and I can really tell a difference in the fine lines. I love to touch my face after I use this. So soft. I wish they made a body cream just like this.</li>
    <li> My experience with Garnier products is that they can be hit or miss. I received a mail sample of this product, wasn&#x27;t expecting much, and really loved it so now I&#x27;m on the subscribe and save program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent! One nice thing about Garnier products is that they smell great. The scent is pleasant yet subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the bottle. It&#x27;s got a cool design, and the serum/moisturizer is easy to dispense with the pump. Another nice thing is that the instructions are in a readable font. It drives me nuts when these products that are obviously marketed to older people have microscopic print.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it feels great on my skin. It absorbs well and makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have dry sensitive skin and I always prefer this product to keep it from breaking out in a red flaky rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soothes any irritation, calms any redding areas, and smooths the skin back down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
    <li> I really like this product, I actually just finished my first bottle. It goes on nicely, easy to smooth over entire face and neck and it dries quickly. I&#x27;m not really sure if its working but I have read that it&#x27;s an effective, good quality product that I like. I am happy &amp; will continue to use</li>
    <li> I had been using the Garnier wrinkle reducer eye roller, but wanted something that I could use on my whole face and moisturize at the same time. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and I already see an improvement in my skin. The fine lines around my eyes and the creases on my forehead are diminishing, and my skin is becoming firmer. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with the results so far, especially considering the low cost of the product .</li>
    <li> Product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Have used a few bottles already and have seen great results.  Great for sensitive areas such as under the eyes (such as I have).  Keeps it well moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for 6 years and I plan to continue using.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend for a beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> wrinkles vanished, thanks</li>
    <li> Smooth skin and glow, keeps my face fresh and moisturize.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 36 (have just a little mimic wrinkles) and I really satisfied with this Serum!!! Love it! No sticky effect. No strong smell. Got perfect result after 1 month using. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer blends so nicely into the skin, it&#x27;s light and non-greasy!  I feel my skin looks better and my makeup goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> I marked it as a 4 star because it is good and I am seeing my wrinkles go away but since I use several products together with Garnier Ultra Lift 2-in-1 I cannot honestly say this product is responsible for all the positives I am seeing.  I use this product mainly on my face and dilute it with water to avoid breakouts.  I have also used this on sun damaged spots such as my elbows, neck, knees and thighs.  Great improvements in these areas but then again, i am using several products with this one.</li>
    <li> I am 58 years old and recently lost 40 lbs. so my neck resembled a turkey. I am a lifelong Mary Kay user, but, not happy with any skin firming product from Mary Kay so I purchased the Garnier Ultra-Lift night cream. All it did was make my neck skin itch horribly and created very dry red patches of skin, especially at the very base of my neck. Also, the dry red patches have created more wrinkles so I look worse! I am throwing away most of the jar! I would be more upset if I had paid more than the $14.97 price from Target. This product will not make me a converted Garnier user. At least Mary Kay products did not make my skin worse. DO NOT PURCHASE OR USE GARNIER ULTRA LIFT NIGHT CREAM.</li>
    <li> Too waxy and it&#x27;s Cheaper at Walmart!</li>
    <li> best cream for the face, easy to use and simple to apply.  not sticky or gummy at all.  your face will look better in 30 days, garnier guarantees it.</li>
    <li> I like the way this product works for the most part. It leaves a bit too much shine on the skin after applying, but okay. The only problem I have is the horrible strong smell. It makes my eyes water and makes me cough when I am putting it on. Otherwise makes the small lines less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!  I went out with my aunt, and had not seen her in awhile, she looked great!!!  My aunt is 60 yrs old,but her face was tighter,and brigher...I thought she had work done,I asked her what she did,she responded by telling me she has been using garnier&#x27;s new 2 in1 cream. I of course had to go buy it. I am 38 yrs old and showing signs of aging, dull skin..I put in on right away and I absolutely love it!!!  Instantly removed the fine lines, and brightened my skin..It&#x27;s smells good, its not thick, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and I have been using it for two weeks now, and have had amazing results, and now my friends are asking me what I use on my face...I would HIGH RECCOMMEND this product to anyone! Oh and as soon as you apply it you can feel it working, it tingles, and you feel it tightening your skin!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use a couple of times a week to make my much more expensive moisturizer last longer.  After the 1st use I saw such a difference in my skin tone &amp; wrinkles that I haven&#x27;t used the expensive stuff.  After a little more than a week I&#x27;m hooked!  I have rosacea which was pretty much under control.  However, I&#x27;ve been using foundation &amp; powder to cover up my Rudolph nose (red &amp; shiny.)  I&#x27;ve seen such an improvement in my overall skin tone and reduction in the redness on my nose that I decided to try mineral foundation for the 1st time and love it!  Now I&#x27;ll have one less liquid to try to fit in the quart size bag when flying!  And my wrinkles have been greatly diminished.  I had stopped sleeping on my side because I was noticing vertical wrinkles forming on my forehead.  Those have disappeared and I am sleeping on my side again which is my preferred position.  I love the fact that it saves time since it&#x27;s 2 products in one and it costs about 1/4 of what I was using.  GREAT product for over 50 women with sensitive skin!  The scent is a little stronger than I would prefer, but it goes away after a little while &amp; I&#x27;m willing to put up with it for these kind of results!</li>
    <li> Good results. My between-the-eyes creases diminished!  Like it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I have wasted a ton of money on a lot of different moisturizers.  From Cetaphil to Eucerin, nothing worked.  I got this as a free sample at a beauty party at a friends house and I tried it and was amazed that it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  This is a great moisturizer, it wasn&#x27;t until later that I realized it was also a wrinkle reducer.  I don&#x27;t really care much about that but my skin looks great now thanks to this product.  No more flaky patches or red irritated skin.</li>
    <li> Seems to work if used regularly</li>
    <li> This product is really a great facial moisturizer, as for the wrinkle reducing aspect I really don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m 32 years old so I&#x27;m not very wrinkly. I just bought it to be ahead on that part (prevention).</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this moisturizer and the subtle fragrance.  It does make my skin look better, in fact, no one believes that I&#x27;m really over sixty.</li>
    <li> Been using this twice a day as directed for a whole year now &amp; it did not reduce the visibility of my faint laugh line. If it won&#x27;t work on the smallest line then it probably won&#x27;t do much for a deeper wrinkle. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Amazing purchase I just ordered it tow weekes ago and I Start to see the results already</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife, I noticed a difference, she is a little more critical,</li>
    <li> This product did moisturize my face, but that&#x27;s all it did, and I can do that with my standard moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After four weeks of per-instructions use, the wrinkles I was targeting (two above my upper lip) are as visible as they were when I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have noticed an exfoliating effect, but I&#x27;m not sure whether what was coming off was skin or just dried product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came out oddly, never fully mixed. There was clear, very thin fluid plus a thicker yellowish fluid. They were NOT mixed. The smell was also \\&quot;off,\\&quot; almost like the odor of oil going rancid.</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample in the mail. It gave me a dewy complexion. It was great for my sensitive, acne-prone skin. Not irritating at all. I loved it. I didn&#x27;t find the odor offensive at all nor did it linger. My face felt great. I just shelled out quite a bit of money for the trial/travel kit of a pricey brand, (all of which is gone already, might I add) and was none too impressed. For a fraction of the price, I am quite impressed by this product.</li>
    <li> This is a product best suited for women who are just starting to show some aging. It is quite a nice serum/cream as are most&lt;br /&gt;products producted by Garnier...</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great on my skin, I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer since July, and so far my skin is so soft. I don&#x27;t wear make up or anything., and I mostly get complement about how nice is my skin. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, I try to apply this morning and night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Garnier&#x27;s Ultra-Lift Serum for over 3 months now and I was quite skeptical at first. For something so inexpensive, I figured there&#x27;s no way it would be any good, but it received very high marks from several women&#x27;s magazines so I decided to give it a try. My husband, who is 10 years younger than I am, had begun to make little comments about my skin, saying that I was getting crow&#x27;s feet and that my laugh lines were noticeable -- which I thought was normal.  Well, hmpf to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I started using the Serum in combination with washing my face with a Neutrogena gentle facewash/make-up remover every night, and using St Ives Apricot scrub in the mornings, which I&#x27;ve used for many years. I like the way the Serum feels on my skin and that it absorbs very well. I use one full pump, about a nickel-size amount. I spread it on my face and neck, making sure to rub it in very well (a dermatologist told me once that products don&#x27;t work unless you rub them in really well). It feels good on and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 months I wasn&#x27;t noticing any difference, though I have been getting some compliments at work on how pretty I looked lately. I attributed this to my having been wearing makeup more often. Last night my husband and I were talking and I mentioned that I was going to do an Amazon order and I didn&#x27;t think I would reorder the Garnier Serum because I hadn&#x27;t noticed any difference, and he said \\&quot;NO! You have to reorder it!!! Your skin looks so much better and it feels softer and your eye wrinkles are way less...\\&quot; and blah blah blah &lt;things that made me feel old&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion: if you are older than your husband, buy this serum because it will make him not tease you as much. ;)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing I LOVE IT, but at drug stores or walmart its about 5 dollars more so waiting for it to be shipped is well worth the wait for the price here on amazon!</li>
    <li> Use it daily.  Non greasy.</li>
    <li> LOVE this serum!  I purchased my first bottle a couple of months ago and I use it nightly as part of my routine.  A little goes a long way.  I have noticed a marked decrease in the fine lines and crows feet around my eyes, and my skin is so much softer as well.  It is a bit heavy for me for the daytime, that&#x27;s why I use it only at night.  I just ordered my second bottle and will continue to use this nightly.  Please Garnier, don&#x27;t discontinue this product!</li>
    <li> I needed a new moisturizer, i researched and decided to try this one after reading reviews, etc. Its light, not greasy and its easy!!</li>
    <li> I have not found this to be any different than other products that I have used.  On to the next brand!</li>
    <li> Saves time with only one application, only one thing to puchase and only one bottle on the vanity; also does a great job!</li>
    <li> Over the years I have used many Garnier skin products. I have found all of them to be exactly what they say that they are. I tried this new one this time and can testify to the fact that the claims made by Garnier are TRUE!! This is a keeper ladies!</li>
    <li> Tried a free sample of this product and really liked it so bought it here on Amazon because of the price. It was much cheaper than the stores. It goes on light and I have seen that my facial lines are less visible. I like the fact that it also has a moisturizer since you can never have enough of that in my opinion. Saves time by having both in one product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about removing wrinkles, but pretty good moisturizer</li>
    <li> I work in clinical esthetics and have used/tried so many hydrating serums, lotions, etc. in the past 20 yrs.  This product ROCKS!  I use it post-peeling and keep a supply on hand to sell to customers.  Dept store mark-up is hard to justify in today&#x27;s repressed market.  With 2-in-1 by Garnier you literally get serum + lite lotion infused into one product, it absorbs wonderfully, it&#x27;s lite and grease-LESS, and I&#x27;ve converted many Estee Lauder and Lancome cust to this and they love it as well.  It&#x27;s 1/5 the cost of dept. store products.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a year now, and I know that it works.  When I first started using it, I unwittingly conducted an experiment when I applied the cream to my face and my throat and neck underneath my chin.  I didn&#x27;t put it on the rest of my neck as I was mainly concerned with the area under my chin...  Well, the skin where I used the cream has gotten noticeably smoother with more even color, and now I&#x27;m working on getting the rest of my neck to match! I love this product, it&#x27;s lightweight, not greasy, and has almost no scent.  I apply it at night and in the morning before I put on makeup.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> There was a free sample of this inside my magazine.  I noticed the strong smell after I broke the seal, but I hoped it would go away so I went ahead and applied it to my face and neck.  After it dried, I noticed that it made my skin feel tight, not soft and smooth like my regular moisturizer.  I kept it on for about half an hour.  That&#x27;s as long as I could stand it, so I washed it off.  The smell was absolutely nauseating to me, but keep in mind that I am sensitive to chemical odors.  The smell might not bother most people.</li>
    <li> Keep your aging skin looking great.</li>
    <li> Product goes on smooth, is not heavy and feels great on my dry skin.  I have not noticed any improvement in wrinkles but &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; this is due to my wrinkles would require &amp;#34;surgery&amp;#34; - no thank you.</li>
    <li> I am 49 with sensitive skin. This didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and was fairly moisturizing. I don&#x27;t like it because it doesn&#x27;t really sink in. I applied it and rubbed it in gently, I then tried to put foundation over it but tiny globs of the Garnier sort of flaked or peeled off. I then tried it again without another product over it, and if I rubbed my skin with any force, this product would flake off (flake is the wrong word because they were moist). I can only conclude that this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t penetrate well. I only let it sit on my skin from 5-10 minutes before loosing patience, perhaps it I left it on for half hour before touching it or layering it would have worked better. For me, there are plenty of better serums and moisturizers out there.</li>
    <li> I, like some of the other reviewers, was skeptical about this product because of the reasonable price. After using it for less than 2 weeks I am thrilled with the results!  My dry, 48 year old skin is looking fresh and rejuvenated!Small wrinkles around my eyes have plumped up and disappeared. The built-in serum also seems to help the moisturizer act as a primer so I don&#x27;t have to use a separate one any more.  My makeup stays looking fresh all day. I was paying way more for moisturizers and was still searching for one that does what this one does! I hope they never stop making this, I will be lost without it!</li>
    <li> i am on my second bottle and I am noticing that I have less wrinkles and my skin looks younger,  I have been getting many compliments on my age and that I look so young.  Also, I have had no breakouts since I have been using this cream.</li>
    <li> I liked that it was a moisturizer and serum in one.  It cuts down on steps....and likely costs less if I did the math.</li>
    <li> although I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any effect on wrinkle reduction, I love the way it feels on my skin, very soft and moisturized without feeling greasy/sticky at all. it also has a nice but subtle enough fragrance.</li>
    <li> I like this product it makes my skin feel very smooth. I don&#x27;t feel a lift or tightening in my skin but I do feel my skin looks better than when I wasn&#x27;t using this. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and if nothing else works as a good moisturizer for me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely looovvveeeee this moisturizer!!! im only 15 so i didnt get this for the \\&quot;wrinkle reducing\\&quot; part but because the skin on my face is horribly sensitive...my nose is always peeling (ive tried exfoliants and normal cleansing but nothing helped)and i HATE the flakes that were always coming off. the top half of my cheeks are extremely sensitive to mereley anything so its hard to even wash my face. i have tried every type of moisturizer and they either absorb well, look greasy, make my skin breakout, make me get a rash, or just plain dont work. but this one is absolutely amazing and it is going to be the only moisturizer i will ever use!! it absorbs well and my skin has actually become less sensitive since i started using it! and its cheap!! thank you garnier!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It appears to be doing all it promises.  Feels great on the skin and goes on very easy.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin &amp; it didn&#x27;t keep my skin really moisturized.  I would put some on &amp; in a day or so my skin would be dry again.  There are better &amp; also inexpensive products out there.</li>
    <li> I do not have sensitive skin!  I have NEVER reacted to a product; Garnier or otherwise and anti-aging or otherwise. But this stuff, oh man.  The only thing I changed in my routine (it was on sale at Target) was this product.  Monday morning, I used one squirt of it all over my face and neck.  Throughout the day, my entire face and earlobes (I know, weird, right?!) were red and itchy.  I did my usual PM routine and then back to my normal AM routine on Tuesday (today)  Still itchy and red!  I am starting to get hives on my earlobes and even a thick layer of hydrocortizone isn&#x27;t helping.  If you do buy this, please please please do yourself a favor and do a patch test!!  Usually I love the fruity smell of Garnier, and this smells fine but my only complaint is they must have shoved the little canister full of cat dander (the only other thing on the planet I am allergic to)  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this because I needed a face lotion but I have such sensitive skin it&#x27;s hard to find something that wont irritate my skin. This stuff is awesome, makes my skin so soft and it has minimized some of the little wrinkles that i have.</li>
    <li> I really tried to get this to work for me, but I have sensitive skin and when it the fumes of it gets into my or near my eyes it is so bothersome, I won&#x27;t be ordering this, but that is just for ME. I am not sure how well it will work for you. So it is one of those things you would have to buy and try kind of deals. Sorry I could not be more helpful</li>
    <li> love this face cream. will be ordering more. very light &amp; nice under makeup</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this product for wrinkles. I have super dry patches on my face and have used many moisturizers and none have worked. This product is amazing as a moisturizer. The is very little scent to this product and is not overbearing in anyway. Garnier has this product out for sample quite often I would recommend trying it. There are also coupons for this product in most local newspapers.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. I know some claim it balls up but I have not had this issue. I never overwork it into my skin, but I do rub it in well. It leaves a nice matte finish that acts like a primer for makeup. I have noticed subtle improvement to the texture of my skin, but no miracles. It reduces my pores and gives a very even appearance. It is never oily or greasy and I like the subtle creamy scent...I hate floral scents and this has more of a creamy vanilla tone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with the Garnier anti-fatigue eye cream and have been very pleased with this product compared with the more expensive creams I have been purchasing.  I will purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time and loved it. I purchased a bottle yesterday, I used it yesterday morning and this morning. My face started to itch this morning and very quickly after broke out in hives. With in a few hours my face was covered in hives and felt like it was on fire. The hives stopped right at my shirt line where I stopped the lotion. After looking at the bottle realized the contents did not look the same as always. Usually half clear and half white, all white this time. maybe a change in manufacturing, would have been nice if the company let the consumer know. It made for a hard day at work when I had to speak with clients all day</li>
    <li> I like the idea of a 2-in 1 product, but this smells like mildew. My other Garnier products smell clean and fresh, but this has an unpleasant odor. Wonder if it came from a bad batch.</li>
    <li> I am 35, so I am just now starting to take proactive actions to prevent wrinkles.  I do have some crows feet starting and have a smoker&#x27;s mouth, even though I never was a smoker, and I feel like it&#x27;s okay, but not like Garnier says it would be.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and after trying many very expensive skin treatment products, I am finding Garnier products do as good a job as the really pricey ones. Skin that holds moisture looks less wrinkled.</li>
    <li> I love the Garnier eye cream and puffy eye roller. I really wanted to like this. It does not smell citrus-like as others say. It smells like butter. I used it for a week, that was as long as I could stand it. The smell goes away minutes after use but it does not continually hydrate like my staple Oil of Olay does. I did not feel hydrated at all. The other huge negative was the nasty reside it leaves. If you apply makeup or even just rub your face, you come away with nasty rolled up reside from the product. I don&#x27;t want that kind of stuff sitting on my face all day long.</li>
    <li> i do not understand how this product has any good reviews. it smells disgusting. and the smell stays for hours. my skin looked ok, and i didn&#x27;t break out, but this product is gross.</li>
    <li> I love this light wrinkle cream.  It is refreshing and leaves your face looking smoother.  This is the first winter that I have not had dry patches on my face.  I think I look better and isn&#x27;t that what&#x27;s most important?</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer make you face feel good and has a nice fresh smell  but I dont know would I get it again not to much in the firmness area ,,good primer though...</li>
    <li> Been using this product now for 2 years, and I really do like it. Both the feel and the smell of it are great! Of course we all know that getting rid of wrinkles is really a fantasy....but I feel that using this has helped!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years, it is not sticky or oily and makes my face feel terrific.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much</li>
    <li> Do not use this product, if you have dry or sensitive skin!  It will also burn your eyes for hours, if you get the product in them.  Either my skin or Garnier&#x27;s formulas have changed, as I can no longer use most of their products!</li>
    <li> Update: As I said, I replaced olay serum and night moisturizer with this. It&#x27;s been almost a year and this stuff is great. You save a ton of money, and it works just as good if not better than the expensive stuff.  This is a great 2 in 1 value. Usually I do olay serum then night moisturizer. For the price you get both! Tip: rub it in gently but thoroughly. Keep away from eyes. Excellent price and results compared to more expensive 2 step products.</li>
    <li> I never get breakouts as my skin tends to dry, not oily. Each time I have tried to use this my face breaks out two days later. The scent has some of the pleasant smell that Garnier products are known for, but with musty undertones. I love Garnier hair products and make up remover wipes and even their shampoos and conditioners. But this just isn&#x27;t up to par with other Garnier products I use. I never break out.......except when using this product. I would not recommend this product unless you enjoy pimples and smelling like dirty, wet socks.</li>
    <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t do without it</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I don&#x27;t know if it reduces wrinkles or not, but it feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Amazon with my points, because I wanted to try a mild wrinkle-reducing treatment as I just turned 30 (I can see wrinkles sneaking up on me). I use this product at night, and it keeps my skin well hydrated as it treats. It is working, as my frowny-wrinkles appear less noticeable. I can recommend this as a stand-alone moisturizer for day also. There is a fair amount of dimethicone in this cream - SO IF YOU WEAR MAKEUP WITH PRIMER, make sure to apply makeup while this serum is still moist on the skin. It seems to &amp;#34;ball-up&amp;#34; in conjunction with other silicone products if you&#x27;re not careful. It has a mild floral/juicy smell that may not appeal to everyone but it is not especially obnoxious, especially for this price. I will continue to purchase this item in the future.</li>
    <li> Garnier, although not expensive by any definition is well worth every penny for keeping your skin smooth, preventing that &#x27;crepey&#x27; look on your cheeks in the sunlight.  I do however, think that the lasting power of this particular serum is lacking, because you tend to get that &#x27;dry&#x27; feeling not too long after liberally applying.  That could be improved upon.  I have dry skin, so noticing the &#x27;dry&#x27; effect may not be a problem for everyone but it is worth mentioning here.</li>
    <li> I really do not see that this helps at all. is another moisturizer is basic. again this might work better on younger skin I dont know.</li>
    <li> I plan on continuing to order this product. This, along with my regular cleansing and moisturizing routine has provided visual&lt;br /&gt;improvements in my skin. I have more &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin now and this has really helped minimize small lines and dryness around the eyes and laugh lines.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> Wrinkles are disappearing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 50&#x27;s and have used Avon products that are relative to my age for many years.  Recently, I tried Garnier Ultra-Lift 2 in 1 Wrinkle Reducer plus the Ultra Lift Miracle Sleeping Cream.  My face has always been slightly oily with minimum aging.  I&#x27;ve been using the Garnier products for 6 months and my face feels extremely dry.  It is to the point that I am noticing all day how dry it feels.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, it goes on very smooth, although I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in wrinkles yet as promised ;-)</li>
    <li> I am 32 years old and have been using anti-wrinkle creams/serums since my mid-20&#x27;s.  My mother always warned me to never wait until I already had wrinkles and to always moisturize even with having oily skin.  She was right on both counts because although I do have oily skin and cannot use most of the heavier moisturizers (I&#x27;ll either break out, be shiny all day, or have my make-up slide around) I can use this product with NO problems.  I also have very sensitive skin that reacts badly to most medicated, scented, or retinol products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the course of my trials I have purchased the MOST expensive moisturizers and anti-wrinkle creams there are.  Many have been \\&quot;good\\&quot; for preventing wrinkles and treating lighter lines....but not worth the hefty price of $30-$125 and/or caused adverse reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product once simply because the price was SO reasonable and I was so tired of trying products that I figured \\&quot;what do I have to lose?\\&quot;.  I have used nothing else ever since that time.  Even my organic, natural Vitamin C and Collagen products don&#x27;t compare in effectiveness, greaseless-feel, and ability to be worn under make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also wear this after washing my face in the morning...as well as a nighttime anti-wrinkle aid and no longer have to buy day/night creams.  This products says it&#x27;s mostly for \\&quot;firming and fine lines\\&quot; but this actually GREATLY diminished a deeper line in my forehead area, has noticeably uplifted my entire face, has totally prevented wrinkles from forming in the corners of my eyes, and has even lessened my break-outs and oil amounts on my skin.  You cannot lose with this product.  Zero irritation, almost no smell, and the best part *for me* is that it&#x27;s a RARE anti-aging serum that HAS NO SPF!!  To some this may be a downside, but I hate being forced to wear certain amount of SPF just because they are contained in nearly all facial make-ups and moisturizers (usually SPF 30) and I&#x27;m also mildly allergic to SPF.  You will NOT regret the money you spent on this even if you are new to wrinkle creams.  You can go try a few that are $50, $70, and even $100 and you&#x27;ll see no big difference between this one and the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite things about this cream after using it for about 1 1/2 years:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Never greasy, absorbs instantly, no SPF, no irritation, no \\&quot;grease\\&quot; and no break-outs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Can be used as both a Morning and Nighttime anti-wrinkle serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  REALLY works on firming your face and diminishing crowsfeet, fine lines, and even deeper forehead wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Never feels heavy, does not settle into already-existing lines/wrinkles, and you only need a dime-sized amount&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  It is under $20 and beats out the competition&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  It actually WORKS with no side effects for people with sensitive, oily, allergic, or even acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.  You can buy this anywhere with no special ordering needed (ie:  Walgreens, CVS, Amazon, Rite-Aid, Target, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a girl who&#x27;s tried every beauty product from creams to serums to make-up and beyond....this is well worth your money x100.  You will notice a difference within a couple of weeks.  Buy it!SPF.  You will NOT regret the money you spent on this even if you are new to wrinkle creams.

    <li> Have been using expensive compound from the doctors and so far I like the product, but have to wait for results.</li>
    <li> Yuck! They put so much fragrance in the product I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS FOR A WHILE.STILL HAVE LINES AND WRINKLES.I WILL USED THE REST BUT DON;T THINK THAT I WILL BUY ANY MORE.BUT IT MIGHT WORK FOR YOU.I HAVE TRY SO MANY PRODUCT OUT THERE. AND SPEND SO MUCH MONEY CAN;T FIND ANY THING THAT WILL WORK.SO I;M ABOUT TO GIVE UP.BUT THIS COULD BE RIGHT FOR YOU.</li>
    <li> I use this under my make-up as a day cream.  I have combination skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave me oily or cause any break-outs;  It absorbs quickly and 1 pump covers my entire face, neck and chest area.  A little goes a long way.  The smell is not over powering.  I will continue to use.  I see improvement in my skin.  I also use the Ultra-Lift Night Cream.  I really like this line.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for awhile now. Feels great!</li>
    <li> Not greasy....absorbs really easily.</li>
    <li> great stuff this is!!&lt;br /&gt;:0)</li>
    <li> Feels great but I wish they would also sell the one that has SPF15 builtin.  THis is perfect for night time and indoor days however.</li>
    <li> Not so hot. I could not see anything it done for my skin.. Sorry!</li>
    <li> Received this item today. When I opened the lotion there was no lid on the bottle, a portion of dried lotion sticking out and a hair stuck to it. Thought I was getting a new product. I will be returning it, so disgusted and disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use this daily for facial moisturizer.  Feels wonderful on my face.</li>
    <li> Used for years and really love it great price too!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to tell if it has reduced the wrinkles that I have. As far as the moisturizing portion of the product it goes on pretty thick and doesn&#x27;t absorb in all the way. I wouldn&#x27;t wear this product under makeup, but it works okay as a night time moisturizer. It also kind of leaves a residue after it dries all the way.</li>
    <li> I get this for my friend, she loves it.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like mens deodorant, and not in a good way.  More like men&#x27;s deodorant with a side of BO.  I got a sample of this in the mail, tried it, and had to wash it off because I couldn&#x27;t take the smell.  Than I had to wash my face again because the smell just lingered...and lingered...and lingered to the point of giving me a headache.  Stay away if you don&#x27;t like your  facial products to smell like a locker room straight out of Animal House.  I will stick with my Paula&#x27;s Choice products</li>
    <li> second times a charm !!&lt;br /&gt;first time i tried this, I HATED IT,&lt;br /&gt;then i waited months &amp;amp; tried it for just day time,&lt;br /&gt;i was ADDING to much the first time,&lt;br /&gt;I bought a massage Roller On line, ( that helps )&lt;br /&gt;i use this for day time now,&lt;br /&gt;then at night i use  Hyaluronic Acid Cream Moisturizer  BOUGHT  on here to.&lt;br /&gt;between the two ,they both TEAM up good,&lt;br /&gt;be sure to get a massage roller or use your  hands,&lt;br /&gt;but massage it in good&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;i clean off my make up with NOXEMA,&lt;br /&gt;i take time with my face!</li>
    <li> So glad I purchased this product. Feels sooooooooo nice on my skin. I have already told my friends about it. Also happy to find that I can purchase it in any Rexall Pharmacy.</li>
