      <li>So handy</li>
      <li>Honestly I&#x27;ve used it maybe 10 times already</li>

      <li>It comes with a cute zippered bag to store away when its disassembled.</li>
      <li>but since I am going to be washing used brushes weekly rather than hoarding them all till I have an hour of washing to do, it&#x27;s going to be okay.</li>
      <li>Just my honest unbiased review since I PAID FULL PRICE FOR IT.</li>
      <li>i love this its makes drying my brush so easy</li>
      <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a plastic type of bag to easily store it, but I&#x27;m keeping the box too just to keep it more</li>
      <li>keeps my brushes perfect while they dry, just what I needed!!</li>
      <li>The vinyl storage pouch keeps the three individual pieces together - good add-on!  </li>
      <li>I assume it&#x27;s there to keep the finish from being scratched, but it doesn&#x27;t come off easy.</li>
      <li>But when it came to assembling which is easy</li>
      <li>People are saying it comes apart too easily.  </li>
      <li>these are fantastically easy to use.</li>
      <li>It has a strong paint or glue smell.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping and it works!</li>
      <li>It was a huge pain</li>
      <li>Cheaply made and broke into pieces witching</li>
      <li>I saw someone said that its cheaply made.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s definitely a great product for every day use especially for my foundation brushes.</li>
      <li>Unlike others said I don&#x27;t feel the holder is cheap</li>
      <li>:) I think it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t fit ALL my brushes into it</li>
      <li>Super shiny and dainty not like the cup I was using to dry my brushes before I ordered this.</li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>I have like 30+ brushes that I clean 2x a week</li>
      <li>Full how-to on my blog, here: http://thebeautyofmidlife.com/2015/05/how-to-and-how-often-to-clean-your-makeup-brushes/</li>
      <li>the paper they have on it to protect it was super hard to remove, and the paper is die cut perfectly around each hole!  </li>
      <li>Perfect for drying my expensive brushes, I feel better knowing the water isn&#x27;t sitting in the bottom of the brush.</li>
      <li>However, that&#x27;s a very small price to pay for the great quality and how many brushes it holds,</li>
      <li>I also really like how its collapsible so you can store it away easily.</li>
      <li>and it did a great job of drying my makeup brushes (much faster than using a cup to dry them in).</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the first thing I have bought from B. M.C. I paid FULL price for this item.</li>
      <li>right on time..</li>
      <li>this is pretty durable.</li>
      <li>Definitely make sure kids don&#x27;t get their hands on it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not big as my expectations but overall the item is good and useful</li>
      <li>and it really holds a lot of brushes!</li>
      <li>this first arrived</li>
      <li>The first five minutes of me assemblying it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s of a heavy, good quality and the rubber holes for the brushes seem sturdy and can hold up to me pulling my brushes through.</li>
      <li>The item description photo and the photo on the package show a nice, black, glossy stand.</li>
      <li>My brushes dry faster and keep their shape better with this rack.</li>
      <li>But the glossy black finish is nice underneath.</li>
      <li>but that was an unusually large one and again, I have no idea</li>
      <li>Very high quality brush holder.</li>
      <li>it would be so much easier to remove it, and probably cheaper for them not to use die-cut paper.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made of very durable and sturdy material and will not be knocked off balance.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up much room</li>
      <li>Wow, this is a pretty nifty product to have.  </li>
      <li>Holds my face and eye brushes, this holder is perfect for when you wash your brushes and you want to keep them upside down so that the brushes last longer and have less fall out.</li>
      <li>Perfect way to dry brushes with the bristles down - saves the ferrules from breaking down and prolongs the life of your brushes..</li>
      <li>I love how small this product is it doesn&#x27;t take up much room at all</li>
      <li>but when I think about all the years I&#x27;ve spent either not washing my brushes at all or dealing with the pain of trying to dry them kind of flat on towels (but not fully flat, because you don&#x27;t want water going into the glue), it feels totally worth it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to set up and then put away to hold my make up brushes upside down to dry after washing them.</li>
      <li>so storing it that way is far preferable to leaving it out all the time.  </li>
      <li>I am not too bothered by it because it doesnt effect my brushes, but some people may be sensitive to that.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough how much I&#x27;ve been recommending this to my friends and clients I&#x27;ve worked on.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent tool for makeup artists:)</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Help me with the cleaning of my makeup brushes</li>
    <li> I love it already. I just opened the package and took the packing tape off of the product. I have yet to use it but I am sure I will be pleased.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it... and right on time..</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! keeps my brushes perfect while they dry, just what I needed!!</li>
    <li> very good holder for your brushes</li>
    <li> Works well to prevent dust build up on brushes and dry them after washing</li>
    <li> Compact and Sleek. You have to peel off the brown protective layer before use (which is slightly annoying). I have used the product once and it did a great job of drying my makeup brushes (much faster than using a cup to dry them in).</li>
    <li> Bought this for my partner - she loves it! The stand is firm, the silicone holders are sturdy. The ease of use really depends on your daily usage. If you&#x27;re looking to store your brushes for daily use (i.e. brushes stored brush-up) these are fantastically easy to use. If you&#x27;re looking to use them to dry your brushes (i.e. stored brush-down) you will probably face the same complaint that my partner had is that it is rather unwieldly to try to remove the brushes downwards.</li>
    <li> I am pretty impressed with this. It holds a variety of brush sizes and allows the brushes to dry without risking water running back into the handle and possibly breaking down the glue seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this first arrived the plastic smell was absolutely horrible. It was like a combination of gasoline and ammonia. Also, I&#x27;m assuming to protect the product. It had a sticky paper covering on it that took me at least ten minutes to peel off. It was a huge pain the the ... But once that was off the pieces slide in and it just works. No real complaints other than the initial smell.</li>
    <li> Wow, this is a pretty nifty product to have.  I have several makeup brushes, my teen daughter on the other hand has tons and this absolutely was perfect for cleaning all of our brushes.  She has brushes that I don&#x27;t even know what to do with but the variety of sizes this holds worked out perfectly.  Too bad she has about 40 brushes, she could not do them all at once.  She only had one brush that did not fit but that was an unusually large one and again, I have no idea what I would even use that for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint, the paper they have on it to protect it was super hard to remove, and the paper is die cut perfectly around each hole!  If they just had one solid sheet I could have poked a hole in it and maybe I would have had a place to grab the paper from.  If they stopped trying to be so fancy it would be so much easier to remove it, and probably cheaper for them not to use die-cut paper.</li>
    <li> The only thing that really made me annoyed was the packaging. It comes with a protective sticker on all sides except for one and it was really hard to get a hold of the sticker to tear it off. I wish they would have left a little but over the edge so that the removal process of the sticker wasn&#x27;t so Bad. I love how small this product is it doesn&#x27;t take up much room at all it isn&#x27;t the most sturdy but it does the job :) I think it&#x27;s well worth the money. It grips your makeup brushes beautifully.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! It&#x27;s very easy to set up and then put away to hold my make up brushes upside down to dry after washing them. It&#x27;s only three pieces plus a plastic storage bag. It&#x27;s slim when in the bag, so I can push it between my plastic drawer organizer and the wall of my bathroom cabinet, it takes up barely any space. It&#x27;s of a heavy, good quality and the rubber holes for the brushes seem sturdy and can hold up to me pulling my brushes through.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. As other reviewers have stated it does take some patience to get the protective paper off but once it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s so easy to assemble and seems to be good quality. Super shiny and dainty not like the cup I was using to dry my brushes before I ordered this. Looks great on my bathroom counter. Doesn&#x27;t take up much room but I can always disassemble it and put it away when I&#x27;m not using it. It comes with a cute zippered bag to store away when its disassembled. Mine doesn&#x27;t seem like it will break. I saw some reviews saying that it broke immediately this is pretty durable. So unless you&#x27;re throwing it around or purposely trying to break it, I can&#x27;t see it just snapping in half. You do have to use some caution when inserting your brushes so it doesn&#x27;t topple over but aside from that I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first thing I have bought from B. M.C. I paid FULL price for this item. I have nothing to gain from leaving this comment. Just my honest unbiased review since I PAID FULL PRICE FOR IT.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not big as my expectations but overall the item is good and useful</li>
    <li> Using it now and loving it. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Perfect way to dry brushes with the bristles down - saves the ferrules from breaking down and prolongs the life of your brushes..</li>
    <li> So handy and it really holds a lot of brushes! All my girlfriends want one now. I also really like how its collapsible so you can store it away easily.</li>
    <li> Perfect for drying my expensive brushes, I feel better knowing the water isn&#x27;t sitting in the bottom of the brush. It came with a bag to put them in too. The item also comes with plastic paper on it that you have to scrape off, it&#x27;s such a pain! I made my sister do it, my nails were too short.</li>
    <li> I have been using this to dry my makeup brushes after cleaning for months now, several times a week, for about 4 months now. I can&#x27;t say enough how much I&#x27;ve been recommending this to my friends and clients I&#x27;ve worked on. This is made so well and stands sturdy. The rubber material that adjusts to hold the brushes has never lost shape or faultered.&lt;br /&gt;The only noticeable suggestion I would make for change would be its packaging smell. It has a strong paint or glue smell. I am not too bothered by it because it doesnt effect my brushes, but some people may be sensitive to that.</li>
    <li> It arrive on time very easy to put together.  It holds my brush good.  I was looking for something to hold my brush this did the trick.  It was as describe it arrived on time I had no problem.</li>
    <li> People are saying this is cardboard.  It&#x27;s a brush dryer, y&#x27;all.  How would it function if it was cardboard?  Every piece arrives covered in a brown sticky paper that you peel off, revealing the black plastic below.  People are saying it comes apart too easily.  It&#x27;s meant to come apart.  It comes with a little storage bag to keep the three pieces flat when not in use.  I have a severe dust allergy so storing it that way is far preferable to leaving it out all the time.  Maybe it seems like $20 is too much to pay for a few pieces of plastic but when I think about all the years I&#x27;ve spent either not washing my brushes at all or dealing with the pain of trying to dry them kind of flat on towels (but not fully flat, because you don&#x27;t want water going into the glue), it feels totally worth it.  I know I&#x27;m going to keep on top of my brush laundry, and it won&#x27;t feel like such a chore.  I can&#x27;t fit ALL my brushes into it but since I am going to be washing used brushes weekly rather than hoarding them all till I have an hour of washing to do, it&#x27;s going to be okay.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great for my brushes. The only problem is that it&#x27;s a little smaller than I thought. I have lots of brushes and I cannot put them all in the case since some of them will touch each other. But it&#x27;s definitely a great product for every day use especially for my foundation brushes. It&#x27;s quickly dry and keeping the shape.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life?!? Removing the protective layer from the glossy black was a bit tricky, but it is worth the struggle. My brushes dry so much faster when hanging from this. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Great product but my product came cracked. Wish I could get a replacement.</li>
    <li> Makes drying my makeup brushes ten times easier!!</li>
    <li> Works to dry my  brushes just as well as the expnsive brands.</li>
    <li> When I received my package I was so excited when I opened it; I was a bit confused because it didn&#x27;t look finished. It had a wood looking finish but I realize that is just a stick on that was protecting it. So I started to peel the paper off the items. But when it came to assembling which is easy but I had a defected one. There should be an opening where you fit the center piece throw the flat tray but the opened was glued incorrectly. Because the sides are identical if they are facing the same direction. They incorrectly glued the sides in opposite direction leaving the center opening over lapping in opposite direction. because of that the center tray holder that could not go through the center, the top tray that was glued was blocking the opening. I had to return! Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this thing! I saw someone said that its cheaply made. ITS NOT. It&#x27;s just thin plastic. Honestly I&#x27;ve used it maybe 10 times already and it&#x27;s durable. I tripped and fell the other day and the upper corner of the stand broke and I patched it together with some tape and it was like nothing happened. I love this thing!!!!</li>
    <li> Came quickly and works great; great representation by seller.  Must practice lifting horizontal tray to install brushes at the right height and then settle back onto the assembled base; but feels very sturdy once in place.  I wash my brushes 1x/wk so it takes up counter space just overnight.  I spend good money on quality brushes so this is well worth the money.  The vinyl storage pouch keeps the three individual pieces together - good add-on!  Drying my brushes with this protects the shape best and keeps moisture from warping or rusting the handles - I love it.  No make-up enthusiast or artist should be without one!</li>
    <li> i love this its makes drying my brush so easy and it also take up little to no space</li>
    <li> Very overpriced for a thin  plastic and card board device</li>
    <li> Love this drying rack! I bought one for me and one for my friend as a birthday gift. My brushes dry faster and keep their shape better with this rack. Full how-to on my blog, here: http://thebeautyofmidlife.com/2015/05/how-to-and-how-often-to-clean-your-makeup-brushes/</li>
    <li> Loved the item great communication.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and it works! I&#x27;ve already used it, but it&#x27;s fragile. Definitely make sure kids don&#x27;t get their hands on it. Always make sure it&#x27;s on a flat/stable surface too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a plastic type of bag to easily store it, but I&#x27;m keeping the box too just to keep it more protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I expected but it&#x27;s great for its price and arrived super speedy!</li>
    <li> The item description photo and the photo on the package show a nice, black, glossy stand. What I received was unfinished particle board with the particle board logo still showing! The product does what it says it does, but is totally hideous and different from the description.</li>
    <li> I love it I use it when drying and for keeping my brushes</li>
    <li> Love this brush drying rack!</li>
    <li> Its alil to thin and poorly made..nonetheless it does the job for now</li>
    <li> Cheaply made and broke into pieces witching The first five minutes of me assemblying it. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This is a great product if the stand wasn&#x27;t so brittle.  It cracked upon removing the film covering it.  The film that covered it was NOT easy to remove.  Amazon is accepting this back and refunding me.</li>
    <li> Got this cos it was the most affordable one ($17). It does the same job as the slightly more expensive ones and I am content with that. I have like 30+ brushes that I clean 2x a week and you can imagine the mess they makes. I used to dry them everywhere (laid down on a towel). So you can imagine how pissed off my hubby was of the mess. Now it is way more organized... And, the water drops straight down, making your brushes last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry all of my brushes at once, since it can only hold 26 brushes but that doesn&#x27;t really matter to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> I just received this makeup brush holder today, and I love it! I have a ton of brushes and was looking for something&#x27;s similar to the sigma brush holder but less expensive and that held more brushes. I have found it! Holds my face and eye brushes, this holder is perfect for when you wash your brushes and you want to keep them upside down so that the brushes last longer and have less fall out. Unlike others said I don&#x27;t feel the holder is cheap, yes it&#x27;s on the thiner side and not super thick nor heavy but it&#x27;s compact, it even comes with a pouch for storage it&#x27;s meant to be taken apart after use, which I love it makes it convenient to have a pouch to store it in, and just pop it out when it&#x27;s time to get wash your brushes. I think it&#x27;s a must have in any girls vanity and makeup collection, makes the dreadful task of makeupbrush cleaning, a much faster process!</li>
    <li> It has lots of space for different sizes of brushes, comparing to other brands I&#x27;ve seen here. You have to peel the protective paper off, which took me a few minutes. But the glossy black finish is nice underneath. The price was honest. It works well.</li>
    <li> Very high quality brush holder. It&#x27;s made of very durable and sturdy material and will not be knocked off balance. The only thing that is bit of a downside is the fact that you have to remove this really ornery sticker off the surfaces of each part of this brush tree. I assume it&#x27;s there to keep the finish from being scratched, but it doesn&#x27;t come off easy. However, that&#x27;s a very small price to pay for the great quality and how many brushes it holds, verses it&#x27;s competitors and their prices. Definitely recommend!</li>
