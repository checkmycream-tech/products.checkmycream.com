      <li>A great head to practice face painting on</li>
      <li>Great product and prompt delivery.</li>
      <li>This was great for her to use and kept her from wanting to put the makeup on everybody else.</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s the tips I used successfully: Sprayed the mannequin I&#x27;ll call &#x27;Mo&#x27;</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t even need a stand because it comes on its own stand!</li>
      <li>but this was a good solution for this head.</li>
      <li>A good product with limitations</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still a good head to practice on.</li>
      <li>So all in all, good product.</li>
      <li>So the paint goes on well, and it&#x27;s nice to practice on because it&#x27;s kinda child size.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice head</li>
      <li>I bought it to practice my face painting and so far it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>Its okay for one time use</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>BUT I did some research and found out it could be cleaned with 91% Isopropyl Alcohol and a Magic Eraser.</li>
      <li>Anyone have suggestions for a better practice head??</li>
      <li>then I guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>This head is just ok.</li>
      <li>Yes, it stains, however it&#x27;s nothing alcohol and a magic eraser can&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
      <li>I have better luck practicing on myself.</li>
      <li>but it should help me get better. :-)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an ok head.</li>
      <li>I tried many things to remove it</li>
      <li>/&gt;***after buying magic rub eraser and 91% alcohol***&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good face to work with although it does stain.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m spending 45 mins to try and clean a head just so I can work on it again!</li>
      <li>The material does come clean with a magic eraser and alcohol.  </li>
      <li>Wiped the paint off easily with the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser.</li>
      <li>so the paint stains easily.</li>
      <li>Also, I wanted to use this a few times before posting a review, to comment on the quality of the product if it was very good, and it is!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sorry, I can&#x27;t get these pics to print at 100% but the paint was primarily on the forehead</li>
      <li>FAST delivery!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it came 95% clean.</li>
      <li>Good enough for us.  </li>
      <li>and it stained quickly.</li>
      <li>She has had a lot of fun with it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think the stand is the right one for this head...</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t expect this product to be perfect, and it sure beats making my poor boyfriend&#x27;s face red with having him try look after look with face paint.</li>
      <li>first time using it</li>
      <li>Stains easily, does not clean as easily as stated.</li>
      <li>just know there is a little more in clean up than just soap and water.</li>
      <li>Way too much.</li>
      <li>You have to practice on real skin to get the real outcome of what the paint will look like.  </li>
      <li>Proceeded with water-based high quality face paint.</li>
      <li>and we didn&#x27;t want her to put it on herself at her young age.  </li>
      <li>Purchased this for our 5 year old granddaughter to use to put on makeup.  </li>
      <li>Not perfect, but good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m practicing different looks with face paint, and I&#x27;m using high end products (not cheep starter sets)</li>
      <li>I recently purchased this to practice normal makeup, not facepaint.  </li>
      <li>Stained with red and black the very first try.</li>
      <li>It apparently had someone use markers or face paint on it</li>
      <li>Also the colors stain the plastic and they&#x27;re hard to clean off.</li>
      <li>It left major stains from the face paint.</li>

<li> and it took me about 15 mins of hard scrubbing.</li>
<li> I was reluctant to purchase with mix of negative reviews regarding staining.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hollow with a heavy PVC base that just slips on and off.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s very hard plastic</li>
<li> NOT a good investment at all!</li>
<li> But it works, if not perfectly, so</li>
<li> Unfortunately it does stain</li>
<li> And not to mention, the white base around the neck isn&#x27;t weighted, its nothing but a PVC Drain from the plumbing department at Home Depot!</li>
<li> Kinda disappointing, as it makes it distracting when trying to paint on it again.</li>
<li> so bad you can&#x27;t get it cleaned up.</li>
<li> It will not work for my daughter if the head slides all around :(</li>
<li> Extremely disappointed with this.</li>
<li> and I was hoping the base would have a hole in it like styrofoam mannequin head</li>
<li> The makeup is very hard to take off!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently purchased this product this April and i tried practicing just now. It left major stains from the face paint. It will not come off! I was planning on not only practicing but photographing my facepaints but I can&#x27;t do that of there are stains everywhere. If you just want to practice drawing on it then I guess it&#x27;s okay. But $30 or so for it? Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter to practice make-up application. There is a warning to keep the face lubricated to protect from staining and she didn&#x27;t lubricate well enough and it stained quickly. Otherwise it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> The makeup is very hard to take off!!!! I tried many things to remove it but nothing seems to work!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this to practice normal makeup, not facepaint.  I had the same issue where the makeup seems to have stained the face.  I&#x27;ve been using makeup remover and face wipes, but I can&#x27;t get all of the product to come off, even after literally scrubbing.  This is not a very good practice doll, as shadows don&#x27;t blend well, and the shape of the lids make it very difficult to apply liner accurately, with all the groves and whatnot.  Also, I don&#x27;t think the face is symmetrical...?  Overall, I would not recommend this to anyone wanting to practice makeup application, and will be sending mine back.  Anyone have suggestions for a better practice head??</li>
    <li> Stains easily, does not clean as easily as stated.</li>
    <li> Great product and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed with this. NOT a good investment at all! I bought 3 of these to teach a face painting class. We used different cakes and airbrush paints and WE COULD NOT REMOVE THE PAINT! We had to use an abrasive scrubber, and even then, the paint didn&#x27;t come off! And not to mention, the white base around the neck isn&#x27;t weighted, its nothing but a PVC Drain from the plumbing department at Home Depot! We only used 2 heads, I will be returning the 3rd one for a refund because I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll take these 2 back :(</li>
    <li> Not pleased at all trying to see how to return product...first time using it it stains so bad you can&#x27;t get it cleaned up. ..I purchased a hair stylist  head and it&#x27;s perfect. ..</li>
    <li> This head is just ok. It&#x27;s plastic,  not at all like painting on skin. Also the colors stain the plastic and they&#x27;re hard to clean off. I have better luck practicing on myself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional face painter, but am learning face painting for my two young daughters and for small church events.  This is a pretty good face to work with although it does stain.</li>
    <li> So the paint goes on well, and it&#x27;s nice to practice on because it&#x27;s kinda child size. However, as you can see by the picture, it doesn&#x27;t come off well. This picture was taken after an hr of scrubbing. I even tried nail polish remover, to no avail. Kinda disappointing, as it makes it distracting when trying to paint on it again. But it works, if not perfectly, so 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***after buying magic rub eraser and 91% alcohol***&lt;br /&gt;I did try this and it did work. BUT i cleaned about half of the head to see the difference and it took me about 15 mins of hard scrubbing. I&#x27;m practicing different looks with face paint, and I&#x27;m using high end products (not cheep starter sets) so the paint stains easily. I&#x27;m spending 45 mins to try and clean a head just so I can work on it again! Way too much. I suppose I can just rise it and paint again with the stains, so it still does work. That is why I raised it to 4 stars. I can&#x27;t expect this product to be perfect, and it sure beats making my poor boyfriend&#x27;s face red with having him try look after look with face paint. So all in all, good product. Not perfect, but good.</li>
    <li> A great head to practice face painting on but it&#x27;s not the same as practicing on a human head. You have to practice on real skin to get the real outcome of what the paint will look like.  Unfortunately it does stain but it&#x27;s still a good head to practice on.</li>
    <li> Its okay for one time use</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to purchase with mix of negative reviews regarding staining. With additional reading and tips garnered from different reviewers I made the leap. Here&#x27;s the tips I used successfully: Sprayed the mannequin I&#x27;ll call &#x27;Mo&#x27; twice with hairspray, allowing to dry between applications. Proceeded with water-based high quality face paint. Admired my work long enough to let it set well enough. Sprayed Mo down with 91% rubbing alcohol that I&#x27;ve placed in a small spray bottle from a Walmart. Wiped the paint off easily with the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser. Rinsed the Eraser and wiped any smears left by moving the paint around the Mo&#x27;s face. Took no longer than washing a child&#x27;s face after the a painting, maybe less time because he was so compliant!&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, I can&#x27;t get these pics to print at 100% but the paint was primarily on the forehead</li>
    <li> The stand shown with it does not work with it.  This head is designed to sit on a table.  The material does come clean with a magic eraser and alcohol.  My granddaughters like to play with it in theatrical make up.  A good product with limitations</li>
    <li> I received this yesterday and it has been USED!  It apparently had someone use markers or face paint on it and it didn&#x27;t come off. I am in the process of trying to exchange it.  I like the head itself, but this item is for a gift to practice for makeup...not paint.  Makeup would probably not even cover these markings.  Not a happy camper right now.  :-/</li>
    <li> I washed this head well then sprayed 2x with a extra hold generic hair spray, I use baby wipes to remove face paint  then respray with hair spray and this  process it still does not have any stains on it ,longest I have left a face painting on it is 4 hrs, and still did not stain , I use paints paradise, mehron, wolf, snazaroo and split cakes Really happy with this head and best of all it does not talk or squiggle around, Ha Ha</li>
    <li> Purchased this for our 5 year old granddaughter to use to put on makeup.  She was fascinated with using makeup and we didn&#x27;t want her to put it on herself at her young age.  This was great for her to use and kept her from wanting to put the makeup on everybody else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok head. it&#x27;s very hard plastic and unfortunately the red paints do stain the face. But I can still do what I need to do. when practicing my face paints it is tough because it doesn&#x27;t react like real skin but it should help me get better. :-)</li>
    <li> This product does not work well for make up application.</li>
    <li> FAST delivery!!! Also, I wanted to use this a few times before posting a review, to comment on the quality of the product if it was very good, and it is!! It doesn&#x27;t even need a stand because it comes on its own stand!</li>
    <li> We purchased this head because we needed it to practice facepainting. I read some of the complaints about makeup not coming off and some face paints but since we use Mehron water based face paints I thought they must come off the Mehron head. They didn&#x27;t. Stained with red and black the very first try. BUT I did some research and found out it could be cleaned with 91% Isopropyl Alcohol and a Magic Eraser. I&#x27;d say it came 95% clean. Good enough for us.  I&#x27;ll try to post some before and after pictures. I hear all heads stain and you just need to expect that but this was a good solution for this head. It&#x27;s a nice head but I give it 3 stars because it comes with no instructions or suggestion for care or cleaning and I was hoping the base would have a hole in it like styrofoam mannequin head so I could put it on a holder and adjust the angle while working. It&#x27;s hollow with a heavy PVC base that just slips on and off. So don&#x27;t shy away if you really need a practice head just know there is a little more in clean up than just soap and water.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my granddaughter.  She has had a lot of fun with it.</li>
    <li> Makeup does not adhere to dolls face</li>
    <li> We purchased this head and a suction cup stand that amazon suggested to go with it.  I don&#x27;t think the stand is the right one for this head...anyone find something that works with it?  It will not work for my daughter if the head slides all around :(</li>
    <li> I love this. I bought it to practice my face painting and so far it&#x27;s perfect. Yes, it stains, however it&#x27;s nothing alcohol and a magic eraser can&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
