      <li>work very well with the same line of conditioner.</li>
      <li>It leaves hair soft and well conditioned.  </li>
      <li>and my hair feels soft.</li>
      <li>I like it because it creates a full thick foam that you can use to wash your whole body with.  </li>
      <li>The other shampoos lose their foaminess or never generate that much to begin with.  </li>

<li> It is not self adjusting or, at least, does not say so.</li>
<li> I have thick and curly hair that tends to be dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> A bargain at twice the price -- seriously.  </li>
<li> and it is always expensive, upon seeing the price on Amazon it couldn&#x27;t be beat.</li>
<li> I have been using expensive salon shampoos, and everything in the stores and every smoothing type of gel, cream and even Moroccan Oil - nothing I tried worked.  </li>

    <li> Yes love the shampoo and the price.</li>
    <li> This is hard to find locally but it is the best 2 in 1 shampoo I have found. It leaves hair soft and well conditioned.  Great for the whole family.</li>
    <li> Finesse products are the best!  As part of the aging process, my hair texture changed completely.  I tried various moisturizing products.  Nothing worked liked Finesse Shampoo and Finesse Conditionier.</li>
    <li> I have thick and curly hair that tends to be dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this shampoo I can run a comb through my curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus points:  women tell me they like the way it smells and my hair feels soft.</li>
    <li> wonderful save me lots of money will be ordering when supply gets low</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair really soft and smells nice.  I like it a lot.  But i use a clarifying shampoo every week or two because it can cause build up on your hair after a while.  Over all it moisturizes very nicely.  Its a very good product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, I&#x27;m not sure why so many stores don&#x27;t sell it anymore. It forces me to shop online and I hate it because its much more pricey!!</li>
    <li> I remember using finesse long ago. Now I noticed the fragrance is too strong and it took a lot of shampoo to cleanse my hair.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was what I was expecting</li>
    <li> Not many stores carry this shampoo brand in our region, so I have ordered it in bulk through amazon. It arrived quickly and is exactly as described.  I love this soap and like the smell it leaves in my hair.</li>
    <li> My favorite - we go to a spa once a year and they use Finesse - I enjoyed it so I kept using it</li>
    <li> This is not the same shampoo shown on the picture on the site.  It is not self adjusting or, at least, does not say so. However, it is a very good shampoo and I can&#x27;t tell the difference in this and the self adjusting shampoo that I have already.  I have short hair that has to be shampooed every day and tends to dry out.  This shampoo leaves it feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and bought it at a great price.</li>
    <li> We used to buy Finesse from Costco and BJ&#x27;s wholesale club before that but for some unexplained reason the only place we could find it was at K-Mart.  They usually only had the smaller bottles.  After trying all the regular brands like Pantene, Suave, Dove etc (bc Finesse was so hard to come by) I finally decided to go online and buy a bunch of them from the cheapest vendor.  (happiness is a full bottle of your favorite shampoo) I like it because it creates a full thick foam that you can use to wash your whole body with.  Being a somewhat hairy fella I like how well it works.  The other shampoos lose their foaminess or never generate that much to begin with.  My daughter likes the shampoos with fragrance so this is not her favorite. My wife could care less and I have no idea how my son feels about it but he uses it with good results.</li>
    <li> I have very long, very thick hair that is also very frizzy.  I have been using expensive salon shampoos, and everything in the stores and every smoothing type of gel, cream and even Moroccan Oil - nothing I tried worked.  I even used Dove with smoothing oil but it just made my hair feel really heavy and still didn&#x27;t help enough with the frizz.  Just out of frustration I bought Finesse shampoo today and guess what?!  My hair is so smooth, shiny and feels so clean and light.  I used to use Finesse in high school (and that was a loooonnngg time ago!) so I didn&#x27;t realize it was so good!!  This is now my FAVORITE SHAMPOO!!!!  My hair looks great!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo it cleans more than normal shampoo&#x27;s do. We used to have in our country, but no longer.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to just about everything and Finesse is the only shampoo and conditioner I can use.  Nice price on amazon.</li>
    <li> Love Finesse shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners! My hair smells and feels great!</li>
    <li> A very nice shampoo. work very well with the same line of conditioner. I recommend to my friends and absolutely will buy it again</li>
    <li> This stuff is astonishing.  It&#x27;s been around, on and off, since the 1950s when it was &amp;#34;Finesse Flowing Creme Shampoo&amp;#34; (yes indeed -- I saw an ad on YouTube!), but I used it in the 1980s and loved it.  It disappeared for a decade or so, but when I saw it back on the shelves I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Amazing!  I like it every bit as much as I used to, and it holds its own with my expensive salon products.... in some cases, it&#x27;s better.  A bargain at twice the price -- seriously.  My hair looks and feels healthy, and the shampoo and conditioner never weigh down my hair or make it fly in all directions.  Perfect balance.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years and love it. I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Product as advertised. On time delivery</li>
    <li> Finesse&#x27;s unique self adjusting formula contains Silk and Soy Proteins that protect the hair shaft with a coat of conditioning shine. So, no matter how your hair is, the result is consistently beautiful hair. For dry, coarse or damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your hair clean, silky soft, ultra manageable and better protected against future damage&lt;br /&gt;Helps you where your need a little and where you need a lot-without build-up or weigh down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wife loves this product uses it all the time. It is hard to find around here and it is always expensive, upon seeing the price on Amazon it couldn&#x27;t be beat. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Best for my type of hair.</li>
