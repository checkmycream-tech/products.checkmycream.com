      <li>I wonder why I have just now found it since I take good care of my skin.</li>
      <li>Good thing they sell this online.</li>
      <li>good...</li>
      <li>I used to use one by Tarte, but am currently loving L&#x27;Oreals Glow one.  </li>
      <li>I love that there are NO parabens, fillers, and that it is made right here in the good ol&#x27; U.S.A!!!</li>
      <li>And if we all paid more attention to that, we might could keep this country&#x27;s &amp;#34;mom &amp; pop&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I LOVE THE WAY</li>
      <li>My face is better than it&#x27;s been in 5 years.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s quite a bit more information than the product listing on here.  </li>
      <li>I feel great, almost to the point after 3 days that I don&#x27;t want to wear as much</li>
      <li>I think it took 3 weeks or better to arrive.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s quite a bit more information than the product listing on here.  </li>
      <li>will buy again for sure</li>
      <li>When I saw Adaye at such a great price, with wonderful reviews, and it was all natural HA, that was all the convincing I needed.</li>
      <li>Over the years, I have tried many, many hyaluronic acid serums~getting fair to moderate results...until now.  </li>
      <li>(Not terrible, but mild.)</li>
      <li>It plumped up those fine lines and made my skin so smooth.</li>
      <li>Concentrated Moisturizer arrived and I was super excited!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best Hyaluronic Acid I found and tried so far.</li>
      <li>It mixes easily with face creams and lotions and absorbs quickly, leaving no residue.</li>
      <li>The bottle is glass and the product looks clean.</li>
      <li>I find it important to support companies that care about producing toxin free and more natural health and beauty products.</li>
      <li>My face already was feeling more smooth and natural.</li>
      <li>I am totally impressed with, not only this product which makes my face look and feel younger, healthier, but the professionalism of this company.</li>
      <li>it has a \\&quot;triple strength 3% concentration\\&quot;; and also that it can \\&quot;penetrate your skin more than 3 times deeper (17% vs. 5%) than high density</li>
      <li>it has a \\&quot;triple strength 3% concentration\\&quot;; and also that it can \\&quot;penetrate your skin more than 3 times deeper (17% vs. 5%) than high density</li>
      <li>Please be aware of what you put on your skin!</li>
      <li>fine lines have really reduced, almost to the point</li>
      <li>So far since this initial review, I haven&#x27;t noticed any spoilage, but I better hurry up and finish the bottle soon- just to be sure!  </li>
      <li>So far since this initial review, I haven&#x27;t noticed any spoilage, but I better hurry up and finish the bottle soon- just to be sure!  </li>
      <li>It is really concentrated (three times) plus it is priced cheap (competitive) like the rest of the hyaluronic acid&#x27;s online.</li>
      <li>and I started noticing a difference in my skin right away.</li>
      <li>essence).&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully I&#x27;ve not had any unusual breakout reaction to this, and I really believe it&#x27;s helping my skin to be more supple, and possibly a bit more on the clearer</li>
      <li>and is really the only kind of serum you need besides sunscreen.</li>
      <li>The one I bought at my dermatologists cost $50.00 for 20ml that&#x27;s a third of this one for more than three times the cost</li>
      <li>Anyhow, the promoted benefits of HA sounded exactly like something I should try.  </li>
      <li>This is my first purchase of Hyaluronic serum</li>
      <li>Perhaps a different blend may work better.</li>
      <li>about Hyaluronic acid you might want to be aware of</li>
      <li>I plan to buy more when I am running low.</li>
      <li>It says &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; but water is listed as the first ingredient.</li>
      <li>Really like this serum as it softened my skin right away</li>
      <li>Microdermabrasion really seems to help take most of the flaky stuff off, but my skin needed something topically.  </li>
      <li>Anyhow, this is great for dry skin because it makes it heal right due to not having chemicals.</li>
      <li>It has lasted quite a while and is very effective in neat form, or mixed with other moisturizers.</li>
      <li>So my bottle of 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum</li>
      <li>I would really recommend this serum, it adds a plumpness to the skin, gets rid of fine lines (would you have believed that there is actually something that can do that?)</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t notice them unless I really get up close to the mirror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>By applying it at night you wake up with skin that feels hydrated and very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>really is.&lt;br /&gt;Night 1:</li>
      <li>I have not seen much results as of yet</li>
      <li>Also I found their customer service to be very responsive to my needs.</li>
      <li>also recommend this particular brand to those that want the pure, non-animal sourced product for a reasonable price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>also recommend this particular brand to those that want the pure, non-animal sourced product for a reasonable price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love how soft my skin feels and how quickly absorbs into my skin highly recomended my skin is less oily sinse i use.</li>
      <li>This product arrived quickly with a personal gratitude not from the seller.</li>
      <li>I been to several different ones that cost way more.</li>
      <li>That might not seem like much time, but 5 years ago I had the skin of someone in their early 20&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Not too long ago I was reading about topical hyaluronic acid in a health &amp; nutrition magazine (think it was \\&quot;Better Health &amp; Nutrition\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin is much more moist and very soft even after just a few days use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Within the last 2 or so years, I&#x27;ve starting to develop those dreaded fine lines under my eyes (for which I&#x27;ve been treating with a calendula cream, and using the smallest tip on my microdermabrasion machine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It felt smooth going on, and I didn&#x27;t get a burning sensation that I have with some other products.&lt;br /&gt;Night 2</li>
      <li>I also have acne prone skin, with occasional cystic acne breakouts, so I&#x27;m pretty choosy about the types and amounts of moisturizers I use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I purchased this particular hyaluronic acid last month, it seems to really be boosting the creams effects, making it soak in faster.  </li>
      <li>You do not have to used but a few drops on your face ,and neck.it leaves your skin so smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I purchased this because I wanted to hydrate my skin and clear up my acne.</li>
      <li>This really works as a deep skin hydrator.</li>
      <li>The problem with buying this at Hyaluronic Acid outside of online is it cost to much</li>
      <li>All Natural.</li>
      <li>Also there is enough in this bottle for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Wow.  </li>
      <li>After using it several nights in a row, my skin was so incredibly soft, I couldn&#x27;t believe it!!</li>
      <li>I use it morning and night on clear bare skin and then layer my moisturizer over it.</li>
      <li>Honestly, it kind of makes me feel a little uneasy about a product when you have so little information on the company</li>

      <li>: I was expecting my face to be super oily as usual with moisturizer, but this wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really see how all the other reviewers think it is.  </li>
      <li>Although my bottle didn&#x27;t have an expiration date, I did a general search to find if topical HA expires, and one company cited that theirs had a shelf life of \\&quot;6-8 months at room</li>

<li> First the bad...the seller sucks.  </li>
<li> Using moistures that have harsh chemicals can give you scars or hyperpigmentation when doing chemical peels or laser because your skin is sensitive to what you can put on it.</li>
<li> It is thick and very sticky.</li>
<li> like I did then use Hyaluronic Acid to help your skin heal right without leaving scars behind.</li>
<li> I just started using this serum and will never go back to other products; not sticky or greasy.</li>
<li> it really does help &amp; with the dry climate &amp; age it makes it hard sometimes!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This really works as a deep skin hydrator. I use it morning and night on clear bare skin and then layer my moisturizer over it. I plan to buy more when I am running low.</li>
    <li> First the bad...the seller sucks.  I think it took 3 weeks or better to arrive.  Also it is sorta oddly sticky. It isn&#x27;t supremely moisturizing either...I can&#x27;t really see how all the other reviewers think it is.  I could NEVER use this alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good...Wow.  It like instantly plumps my face.  Like I can see the wrinkles disappear almost immediately. I use this after washing my face followed by some sort of oil.  I used to use one by Tarte, but am currently loving L&#x27;Oreals Glow one.  My face is better than it&#x27;s been in 5 years.  That might not seem like much time, but 5 years ago I had the skin of someone in their early 20&#x27;s and now I have late 30&#x27;s skin.  Not sure why it caught up to me so fast, but when it did, I went looking for something to help.  Part of that I found in this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so mad about the wait I swore I wouldn&#x27;t rebuy, but now I know I will...I&#x27;ll just have to plan accordingly timewise.</li>
    <li> Really like this serum as it softened my skin right away and I have 60+ skin-will buy again when I run out</li>
    <li> I just started using this serum and will never go back to other products; not sticky or greasy. I wonder why I have just now found it since I take good care of my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.I ordered one for myself and one for my daughter.You do not have to used but a few drops on your face ,and neck.it leaves your skin so smooth and soft.A great product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE WAY THIS FEELS ON MY FACE. I AM 54, AND FIGHTING AGING ANYWAY I CAN. THE PRICE IS GREAT</li>
    <li> Quality product, service and price. My skin is much more moist and very soft even after just a few days use.</li>
    <li> The size of this product is ample for the price. This is my first purchase of Hyaluronic serum so I have nothing to compare it to, but I could definitely feel the tightening and noticed the reduction (almost gone) of the bag under my left eye). Another tightening serum that I&#x27;ve used didn&#x27;t work well with my foundation--this does not interfere with application.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I have tried many, many hyaluronic acid serums~getting fair to moderate results...until now.  When I saw Adaye at such a great price, with wonderful reviews, and it was all natural HA, that was all the convincing I needed. This is without a doubt, the very BEST serum I have ever used! I noticed results under my eyes in just a few days..It plumped up those fine lines and made my skin so smooth. This one is a keeper!</li>
    <li> it really does help &amp; with the dry climate &amp; age it makes it hard sometimes! will buy again for sure</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly with a personal gratitude not from the seller. It has lasted quite a while and is very effective in neat form, or mixed with other moisturizers. I will use again!</li>
    <li> Not oily but thick when I dropper it onto my face and hands. No smell!  My skin looks great. Awesome price. All Natural. No parabens or chemicals.</li>
    <li> It says &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; but water is listed as the first ingredient. That does not make sense. But I do like the product.</li>
    <li> So my bottle of 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum Concentrated Moisturizer arrived and I was super excited! I have read about the qualities this gives to your skin and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. I purchased this because I wanted to hydrate my skin and clear up my acne. (Not terrible, but mild.) I&#x27;m going to give you my three night experience with the serum, so that YOU can see how awesome this stuff really is.&lt;br /&gt;Night 1: I mixed 4 drops with a bit of water and applied it upward and out as directed. It felt smooth going on, and I didn&#x27;t get a burning sensation that I have with some other products.&lt;br /&gt;Night 2: I was expecting my face to be super oily as usual with moisturizer, but this wasn&#x27;t the case. My face already was feeling more smooth and natural. No difference on the acne.&lt;br /&gt;Night 3: I applied in the morning, and at night on the 3rd day after I felt like my face had gotten used to the product. I mixed 3 or 4 drops with the water and did as routine. I would say about HALF of my acne is gone because of how hydrated my skin is now. I feel great, almost to the point after 3 days that I don&#x27;t want to wear as much makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue this routine with this wonderful product; I am so very happy I came across it. I will suggest this to anyone I come across in the need for a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have not seen much results as of yet but I know it may take some time as it took time to get this way. I hope it works like they say.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing.  There have been no signs of anti-aging nor even good moisturizing. Perhaps a different blend may work better. I feel this was a rip-off and a waste of money! It is thick and very sticky.</li>
    <li> I am totally impressed with, not only this product which makes my face look and feel younger, healthier, but the professionalism of this company. I would really recommend this serum, it adds a plumpness to the skin, gets rid of fine lines (would you have believed that there is actually something that can do that?) and is really the only kind of serum you need besides sunscreen. Also there is enough in this bottle for a reasonable price. So you can really actually use the stuff instead of holding back because there is not enough to cover your face. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I have used several hyaluronic acids from several different sellers...This one however is one of the top two!!!  You can actually feel it firming and tightening your skin after you apply it..After using it several nights in a row, my skin was so incredibly soft, I couldn&#x27;t believe it!! And talk about bargain!!  I love that there are NO parabens, fillers, and that it is made right here in the good ol&#x27; U.S.A!!! (today, in these days and times, I would pay a little extra just for that- to keep small businesses open!!) And if we all paid more attention to that, we might could keep this country&#x27;s &amp;#34;mom &amp; pop&amp;#34; businesses afloat..Anyway, if you are a hyaluronic acid user, this is a great one!!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Not too long ago I was reading about topical hyaluronic acid in a health &amp; nutrition magazine (think it was \\&quot;Better Health &amp; Nutrition\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the last 2 or so years, I&#x27;ve starting to develop those dreaded fine lines under my eyes (for which I&#x27;ve been treating with a calendula cream, and using the smallest tip on my microdermabrasion machine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tends to be combination-- oily &amp; dry; with more dry patches (even around my eyes) particularly in the cold weather months.  Microdermabrasion really seems to help take most of the flaky stuff off, but my skin needed something topically.  I also have acne prone skin, with occasional cystic acne breakouts, so I&#x27;m pretty choosy about the types and amounts of moisturizers I use.  Anyhow, the promoted benefits of HA sounded exactly like something I should try.  Being that I&#x27;ve made a concerted effort to change my skincare over to as natural/organic as possible, I looked for one that didn&#x27;t have a bunch of additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I purchased this particular hyaluronic acid last month, it seems to really be boosting the creams effects, making it soak in faster.  I try to apply to slightly moistened skin (after I apply a toner-- usually lavender water essence).&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully I&#x27;ve not had any unusual breakout reaction to this, and I really believe it&#x27;s helping my skin to be more supple, and possibly a bit more on the clearer order!&lt;br /&gt;The fine lines have really reduced, almost to the point I can&#x27;t notice them unless I really get up close to the mirror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Something about Hyaluronic acid you might want to be aware of is that it can come from 2 sources:  One grown from bacteria in a laboratory, the other is an extract from cock&#x27;s combs or chicken cartilage.  The info listed for \\&quot;Adaye\\&quot; is that it&#x27;s \\&quot;vegan friendly\\&quot;, so this is not from the latter source!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m wondering about is the company itself.  I couldn&#x27;t find a website for them.  I believe the address on the bottle was from NYC.  Honestly, it kind of makes me feel a little uneasy about a product when you have so little information on the company itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There happens to be a current listing on eBay (via: SeventhPlanet), for this product.  There&#x27;s quite a bit more information than the product listing on here.  Part of the info for the eBay listing states it has a \\&quot;triple strength 3% concentration\\&quot;; and also that it can \\&quot;penetrate your skin more than 3 times deeper (17% vs. 5%) than high density serums\\&quot;.  ..I recommend if you can, find the listing page on eBay to find out more.&lt;br /&gt;The price there is about comparable with the current Amazon seller (although, I snagged my bottle for $14.93 total, when the price was a little cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering another bottle before I run out, being myself and another person are using this every night.&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend this particular brand to those that want the pure, non-animal sourced product for a reasonable price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**EDIT Oct. &#x27;13: Although my bottle didn&#x27;t have an expiration date, I did a general search to find if topical HA expires, and one company cited that theirs had a shelf life of \\&quot;6-8 months at room temperature\\&quot;.  So far since this initial review, I haven&#x27;t noticed any spoilage, but I better hurry up and finish the bottle soon- just to be sure!  If you&#x27;re concerned, I would contact the seller of this product for further information!**e bottle was from NYC.

    <li> I would like to say that I just started using Adaye serum and I started noticing a difference in my skin right away. By applying it at night you wake up with skin that feels hydrated and very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would like to mention that there are no additional or harsh chemicals and fragrances in this serum. I find it important to support companies that care about producing toxin free and more natural health and beauty products. Please be aware of what you put on your skin!</li>
    <li> I live on the desert so there are times when the air is very dry. I mix Adaye Hyaluronic Acid with my Alaffia Face cream to give it a little boost on those very dry days. It mixes easily with face creams and lotions and absorbs quickly, leaving no residue. I haven&#x27;t tried any other Hyaluronic Acids so I have nothing to compare this one to however I will say you get a generous amount for the price. The bottle is glass and the product looks clean. It is Vegan so it&#x27;s not  made from rooster comb like some others. Also I found their customer service to be very responsive to my needs. I would buy this again</li>
    <li> This is by far the best Hyaluronic Acid I found and tried so far. It is really concentrated (three times) plus it is priced cheap (competitive) like the rest of the hyaluronic acid&#x27;s online. I would recommend to buy this one and stay away from the ones at the dermatologist offices. The one I bought at my dermatologists cost $50.00 for 20ml that&#x27;s a third of this one for more than three times the cost and that&#x27;s at my dermatologists. I been to several different ones that cost way more. The problem with buying this at Hyaluronic Acid outside of online is it cost to much and it&#x27;s to little. Good thing they sell this online. Anyhow, this is great for dry skin because it makes it heal right due to not having chemicals. If you have chemical peels, lasers or the Dermapen like I did then use Hyaluronic Acid to help your skin heal right without leaving scars behind. Using moistures that have harsh chemicals can give you scars or hyperpigmentation when doing chemical peels or laser because your skin is sensitive to what you can put on it.</li>
    <li> I love how soft my skin feels and how quickly absorbs into my skin highly recomended my skin is less oily sinse i use. It.</li>
