      <li>That amount seems perfect, as my skin isn&#x27;t sticky after I use</li>
      <li>Which is great !!</li>
      <li>The L&#x27;oreal Revitalift line is the best.  </li>

      <li>L&#x27;Oreal is a great brand, and I have always been happy with their products!</li>
      <li>I find that this is the brand I buy most as it works best for</li>
      <li>They seem to be well thought out products that do good things for your skin.  </li>
      <li>THE GOOD</li>
      <li>There was no reaction that changed my foundation color, which is good news for me.</li>
      <li>It does a good job in plumping my skin and reduces the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I like that it isn&#x27;t in a jar, but I think this would have been just as good if it came out of a tube.</li>
      <li>Sure it is beautiful and looks fancy...</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal makes many great products.</li>
      <li>so make your own decision if you want to try this.</li>
      <li>I liked about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>: This is a nice drugstore serum with hyaluronic acid.</li>
      <li>This line seems like has some kind of reverse effect.</li>
      <li>I have been using Olay Regenerist  off and on but feel that they have changed the formulation as it no longer seems as effective as it was when it was launched.</li>
      <li>does of course moisturize, plump  and smooth skin as well like all cosmetics of this type , but the light is an excellent way to take attention away from these flaws.</li>
      <li>I am sure I will continue to see good results, I know  it will take time.  </li>
      <li>While it is very easy to dispense and control the amount of serum needed, the opaque packaging will not allow me to tell when I will be running low.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that to be the most effective not just with serums, but with prescription acne creams as well.    </li>
      <li>I originally saw it advertised in a magazine as being really good</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a fairly chemical concoction like most serums are, and it does help to smooth skin and replenish some of the damage.</li>
      <li>This product is a different , but effective , use of light !!!!!</li>
      <li>I purchased the cream version of this product (jar), and I like it much better.  </li>
      <li>I like many of the L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift products.  </li>
      <li>And I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m paying more money for fancy and bulky packaging that will just be thrown away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
      <li>It has many filler products like silica, also silicone products that are meant to be &#x27;plumpers&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have yet to find a serum I love</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll have better results without the risk of irritation.</li>
      <li>What I do love is that this is non sticky and smooths my makeup.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many beauty products for wrinkles etc.  </li>
      <li>this L&#x27;Oreal product may prove to be even better.  </li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>like the cream version better as I am a hands on person</li>
      <li>The packaging is interesting, I&#x27;ll give them that.</li>
      <li>and I am glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I believe that the appearance of my lines will get better and better as I continue to use it.  </li>
      <li>This is an okay product, but I don&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;volume loss&amp;#34; interaction or wrinkle reduction it talks about.</li>
      <li>more* pronounced than before.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s better than nothing for some people.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good product.</li>
      <li>design looks kind of cool as well.the price for the effect.</li>
      <li>design looks kind of cool as well.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be able to tell because the odor is so strong I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>I look in the mirror in the morning, I see my younger face, especially nice and fresh before any make up!</li>
      <li>It has a light texture like most serums.</li>
      <li>What this does do for me though is make my foundation look flawlessly smooth, and for that I love it.  </li>
      <li>I also appreciate the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take much serum to cover my face making me think that like with the Philip Thomas Roth product, I should get a good deal of use out of this serum.  </li>
      <li>good thing I have to say is the serum soaks in fairly fast</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Hyaluronic acid, but good luck finding any in this!</li>
      <li>love the Revitalift line and have been using their regular moisturizer for some time with great results: evening out skin tone and keeping everything hydrated.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and I have been  using it in the morning and at night.</li>
      <li>It seems like it is mostly a bunch of chemical ingredients that would not be good for anyone with sensitive skin (like me).</li>
      <li>easy to use and takes away guesswork</li>
      <li>My skin felt and looked more supple and full.</li>
      <li>It is OK, it feel cool and almost soothing to put on and it seems to stay there.</li>
      <li>If anything, I think the fine lines around my eyes seemed *</li>
      <li>Fine lines are diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works fIne</li>
      <li>I have some fine lines around my eyes, this did nothing for them</li>
      <li>the cons side, it didn&#x27;t do anything to improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>I do not expect this to create a huge difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>This serum contains Hyaluronic Acid which is a top recommended ingredient found in the most effective anti-aging facial preparations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much hyaluronic acid in a product to be effective.</li>
      <li>The applicator is a bit bizarre, resembling a syringe.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample bottle and have used this product for a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>you are looking for something to help smooth out your face, you may just like this product.</li>
      <li>This particular product contains not only hyaluronic acid, which is the best moisturizer for the skin, but also capryloyl salicylic acid, a fantastic exfolilator which also builds collagen.  </li>
      <li>It has a strong fragrance but that goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>The dimethicone allows me to glide my foundation over it, and it looks fantastic, creating a super smooth canvas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>: In the past two weeks I have been getting any number of comments about how wonderful my complexion is.</li>
      <li>The gel glides on easily and is absorbed quickly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It comes with an  easy to use dispenser which puts just the right amount onto your fingertips.  </li>
      <li>It shouldn&#x27;t get in the eyes because makes them watery, but still, if happens by accident, use a drop of any redness/watery eyes relief eye drops to wash it out and calm and it will be fine.</li>
      <li>suggest you use it with the moisturizer to get the full benefit.</li>
      <li>When you are putting stuff like this near your nose, it would be nice if it was unscented.  </li>
      <li>it feels cool.  </li>
      <li>Though this packaging looks cool</li>
      <li>I was always using good and reliable facial cosmetics.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using it for a while now without interruption with any other brands, and I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think you see quick results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 40, my skin is pretty fabulous.</li>
      <li>First thing to say, I did not received free sample or anything, just bought this serum about 40 days on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It is too early to see full results but so far this makes my skin look good without irritation.  </li>
      <li>I liked the product, but it seemed that even though I only use a drop or two, it ran out fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>My skin is very smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I’m a fan of the Revitalift triple power serum, which really works to minimize my fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
      <li>This serum is wonderfully light, and hydrates your skin very well.  </li>
      <li>Not crazy about this product at all.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, but that was not a problem, I was able to use it with no redness.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Update - After using this serum and the related moisturizer exclusively for a 7 days I started getting a pimple or two, seems like this serum is blocking my pores, I have discontinued use at night but continuing to use in the daytime.he formulation as it no longer seems as effective as it was when it was launched.</li>
      <li>: I&#x27;m not crazy about the packaging.</li>
      <li>It will, when used daily in conjunction with a good facial moisturizer, give your skin a softer, more refined, more even finish by replenishing the natural moisture level of the skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>longer term vital looking elastic skin one has to follow the age-old remedies of getting enough sleep, drinking enough water especially in winter, not putting a lot of steam or taking baths with hot water (warm is ok), good eating habits, some healthy vitamins, always cleansing and moisturizing face at night.</li>
      <li>I usually go for products like Philosophy, Fresh, Tarte, Neutrogena, Olay, Aveeno, St. Ives because they are great products that come in simple packaging that feels more environmentally friendly to me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal makes many great products. I find that this is the brand I buy most as it works best for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a very professional look as it looks like a carefully metered hypodermic syringe  According to the box it is measured . You are to spread over your face AM and PM. It is to reduce wrinkles lines and pits and to &#x27;plump&#x27; face where fullness has aged it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s easy to use and takes away guesswork&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I confess I always want to put it ALL into the wrinkles and crannys but I do whole face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my cheeks are still the same as when I was young , so I can&#x27;t tell much about &#x27;plumping &#x27; them up except eyes look less thin underneath. Which is great !!&lt;br /&gt;BUT&lt;br /&gt;It works fIne and I do see results. It is a filler -- that part in any brand just doesn&#x27;t work well for me w/ any product however  L&#x27;Oreals special &#x27; secret&#x27; is its light diffusing that takes away the  wrinkles  noticeableness  It lessens or help them appear to disappear by its use of light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does of course moisturize, plump  and smooth skin as well like all cosmetics of this type , but the light is an excellent way to take attention away from these flaws. Light diffusing is the key. LOVE it !!!&lt;br /&gt;It works for camera work..... It&#x27;s how stars look so young ..... By proper use of lighting  This product is a different , but effective , use of light !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest you also  L&#x27;Oreals line of MIRACLE BLUR  products to use with this !!!&#x27; LOVE the results !!! Especially for your EYES !!&lt;br /&gt;Back to this item -&lt;br /&gt;I like the cream version better as I am a hands on person and I like to control my &#x27;dose&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;But it is gonna work for most all  reading this !!! Nothing with works for everyone when it comes to cosmetics&lt;br /&gt;But this is close ......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took photos of my worst area and it does minimalize the defects / lines/ wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;d give it a try !!! I am very critical of my flaws and what &#x27;fixes&#x27; them&lt;br /&gt;So I suggest ---try it ---&lt;br /&gt;Good manufacturers and good science behind this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope I have helped you !!!!</li>
    <li> It may be too early to tell, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference with this.  I do, however, notice that it plumps my skin right after I use it.  My cheeks look a little puffier, which isn&#x27;t necessarily a good thing.  Nobody else would notice this, and perhaps my eyes are deceiving me, or the 7 pounds I have gained over the last couple months are standing out to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I like the consistency of the formula, but I&#x27;m not fond of the scent.  It dissipates quickly, which is nice, but it is a pretty strong scent for a few minutes.  When you are putting stuff like this near your nose, it would be nice if it was unscented.  It isn&#x27;t oily, and it soaks in quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump is set up to disperse a small amount.  I use one pump for one cheek and half of my chin, one pump for the other half and one pump for my forehead.  That amount seems perfect, as my skin isn&#x27;t sticky after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it, and see what it does in time.  L&#x27;Oreal is a great brand, and I have always been happy with their products!</li>
    <li> LOreal has hit it out of the part with their &amp;#34;Revitalift&amp;#34; line of skin care products. This serum contains Hyaluronic Acid which is a top recommended ingredient found in the most effective anti-aging facial preparations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ignore the &amp;#34;Volumizing&amp;#34; business hype, this won&#x27;t make your face puffy or fill in deep facial lines. It will, when used daily in conjunction with a good facial moisturizer, give your skin a softer, more refined, more even finish by replenishing the natural moisture level of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A serum is meant to be applied first to the skin, under a heavier textured face cream. Used together, you get maximum effectiveness. A serum is not really intended to be used by itself. It delivers different or additional ingredients for increased results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product container has been cleverly designed to resemble a hypodermic needle....Botox, anyone? You depress the button on the bottom of a tall cylinder and a drop or two of the product is dispensed from the &amp;#34;needle-like&amp;#34; tip. The cardboard box packaging is more than twice the size of the actual product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is a cloudy white and scented. It disappears quickly into the skin without any stickiness and leaves a soft finish. Just a few drops are enough to cover the face, although it would be easy to apply more than necessary...especially if you forget and think it should go on thickly like a face cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Retin-A product at night and have been using this serum under an Olay Regenerist face cream in the morning. My skin is very smooth and soft. Fine lines are diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE 3/10/15: In the past two weeks I have been getting any number of comments about how wonderful my complexion is. The only difference in my routine is this serum. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this as I have had success with this product line in the past but this one is disappointing. I see no change after a month of regular use or feel any change in texture.  The instructions say to smooth a few drops on the face but in my experience it takes much more than that The packaging is excessive and its impossible to tell how much product is inside. Its also silly that it looks like a syringe.</li>
    <li> At age 75, starting to see lines around mouth and hope this will help</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 64 and have a few moderate wrinkles and was very hopeful that this product would make a difference. But after using it religiously day and night for the length of the tube (which is about 8 weeks), I saw no difference.  The product is easy to apply and non-sticky, but somewhat expensive at an average of $25 for the tube. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this produce for the last two weeks and I think it works well.  I have lines around my mouth and I see an improvement in those. It is easy to use and I have been  using it in the morning and at night. I let it dry and than add the L&#x27;Oreal moisturizer.  I will keep buying this product.  I originally saw it advertised in a magazine as being really good and I am glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have some wrinkles appearing around my eyes, as well as laugh lines around my mouth that I was anxious to use this with, I liked it and have been using it regularly ever since.  I found the scent pleasing and the texture made it so I only had to use about a pea size amount.  I have sensitive skin, but that was not a problem, I was able to use it with no redness.  After about 3 days, I found that my skin in the areas I had applied this to regularly, was felt smoother to the touch and the grooves of my wrinkle lines appeared to be less defined.  Overall, this stuff does work, so I think that makes it worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I am 31 and although I have minimal fine lines right now, I am proactively taking steps to minimize the signs of aging.  Previously I&#x27;ve tried pricier serums like [[ASIN:B008UPFNTA Peter Thomas Roth Camu Camu Power Cx30 Vitamin C Brightening Serum, 1.7 Fluid Ounce]] so I was curious to see how this would compare.    It is too early to see full results but so far this makes my skin look good without irritation.  I do feel like when combined with my moisturizer day and night my skin looks more hydrated and subtly healthier.  The no irritation is also key for me.  Ever since having a bad reaction to [[ASIN:B00AEMG7NI Perricone MD Blue Plasma, 2 fl. oz.]] I&#x27;ve been more careful about what I put on my often sensitive face.  This doesn&#x27;t generate any stinging or burning.  For me this is important because if something makes my face feel uncomfortable I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t tend to use it long term.  I also appreciate the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take much serum to cover my face making me think that like with the Philip Thomas Roth product, I should get a good deal of use out of this serum.  I also don&#x27;t notice any ill effects when I apply makeup afterwards in the morning.  However, I do try to space out my beauty products and apply it with my lotion before styling my hair and come back to do my makeup 20-30 minutes later.  I&#x27;ve found that to be the most effective not just with serums, but with prescription acne creams as well.    As I mentioned above, I do think with these kinds of serums you have to give them time to see the results.  With other products I&#x27;ve used it&#x27;s taken about two months to get an accurate read so I&#x27;ll update my review when I have a better sense of the long term impacts of this serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this serum for two days/nights and  I really like the effect it has on my skin.  It goes on easily, has a very nice, but faint fragrance, and my skin seems smoother.  I&#x27;ve been using Oil of Olay Regenerist Serum which I also like but this L&#x27;Oreal product may prove to be even better.  I&#x27;ll have to see in four weeks.  Another plus for this L&#x27;Oreal serum is the dispenser which allows for just a few drops to go unto my fingertips.</li>
    <li> I’m a fan of the Revitalift triple power serum, which really works to minimize my fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.  I can’t go without using it daily, so I’d thought I’d try the volume filler version for those “sunken in” areas. At first the results seemed to be the same as the triple power serum, no real difference, other than it being the same price for half the amount of product.  However, when I started to really concentrate on certain areas like my upper cheeks and the creases around my mouth and the sides of my nose, I did notice that the skin seemed to plump up. There is a slight tingling sensation when you apply a lot of the product.  I have been using it daily for a couple weeks and I can tell that my skin looks smoother, firmer and has some added volume.  Since there isn’t a lot of product, I would recommend only using it on your trouble spots and use the triple power serum for the rest of your face.  Another con is that the serum container is a little impractical.  It’s like a large syringe where you push the bottom to dispense the serum one drop at a time.  Because you push the bottom, it’s difficult to stand up and store.  It seems like a lot of fancy packaging for .5 oz of product. In lieu of real injections or filler that actually eliminate creases, this serum does a pretty good job of making them less apparent.</li>
    <li> As I age, I am on a constant quest to find products that help my skin look better. I was intrigued by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It worked. My face looked noticeably smoother after using it. It does &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; in skin to make wrinkles appear less. Even if I skipped a day or two, my face still looked smooth.&lt;br /&gt;* Only a small amount is needed. You just need to gently push the pump to put a small amount on your fingertips to rub into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave this product 4 stars because of the scent. It&#x27;s a heavy, very artificial and not a very nice scent. It is the same scent that is in the other Revitalift products. At least with this product, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something to help smooth out your face, you may just like this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised at how much I like this product. I received a free sample bottle and have used this product for a couple of weeks. I will definitely purchase my own bottle to continue using this in the future. The serum left my face feeling very soft. My skin felt and looked more supple and full.</li>
    <li> I can tell in my upper cheek bones an improvement.</li>
    <li> Great product but the last one ordered seemed to have less product in the tube.</li>
    <li> The L&#x27;oreal Revitalift line is the best.  Period.  The Revitalift line contains ingredients ranging from pro-vitamin A to peptides, which are just excellent for the skin.  This particular product contains not only hyaluronic acid, which is the best moisturizer for the skin, but also capryloyl salicylic acid, a fantastic exfolilator which also builds collagen.  Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for a high quality serum for your skin that does far more than just moisturize.</li>
    <li> Got terrible , terrible burning !!!</li>
    <li> I liked the product, but it seemed that even though I only use a drop or two, it ran out fairly quickly.  I purchased the cream version of this product (jar), and I like it much better.  It&#x27;s not greasy, I only use a little, and the jar lasts much longer like most other L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from SheSpeaks, but the following opinion is my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum has not filled my smile line and forehead lines completely, of course, but it has improved its appearance -- not dramatically but I do see a difference.  I believe that the appearance of my lines will get better and better as I continue to use it.  Been using it for three weeks daily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging has its pros and cons.  While it is very easy to dispense and control the amount of serum needed, the opaque packaging will not allow me to tell when I will be running low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does soak in the skin very quickly and it&#x27;s completely weightless.  It is not sticky or runny.  I only need to dispense a little to cover what I need to cover.</li>
    <li> First thing to say, I did not received free sample or anything, just bought this serum about 40 days on Amazon. I was waiting for a few weeks to see results before leaving a review. I&#x27;m going to report complete experience, which started with the thought &amp;#34;ok, I bought it, I&#x27;ll just spend it as fast as I can so I can buy something else&amp;#34;... and how it felt when first bottle was almost finished...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to be 40 this week, and since the age of 25 I was always using good and reliable facial cosmetics. I also lived in sunny area so not that my face was not exposed to  a lot of sun or coldness in the winter, but I was trying to prevent damage as much as I could. For the last 4-5 years I had to cut my expenses so I switched to cheaper cosmetics, and for the last year I&#x27;m using L&#x27;oreal Revitalift, daily moisturizers, night mask, and recently, serums. I&#x27;m also using L&#x27;oreal Visible lift foundation, which I&#x27;ve found extremely durable during the day, without melting, having a decent UV protection.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, this cosmetic line seems to work, and I do not get new wrinkles, but actually my skin looks smoother and refreshed each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason I bought this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have more wrinkles than 10 years ago, but sometimes, especially when working too long or not having enough sleep, or not drinking enough water, my face, especially around the eyes area, looks dehydrated, skin above my eyelids seems to look thinner and it gives me a tired look. I&#x27;m skinny, I do not eat meat, I work a lot, and sometimes literally I forget to eat or drink so not much help from there to look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Then I noticed this new product, and thought volume filling as described could help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, product seemed too thick, drying too fast, and took me a while to figure out how to apply it. Also I was thinking it will not last for long, because I needed at least 6 drops to actually cover few areas. I was applying it each morning/evening, and after the serum, using Revitalift moisturizer. Better to tap first then massage because absorbs very fast you cannot spread it wide. It shouldn&#x27;t get in the eyes because makes them watery, but still, if happens by accident, use a drop of any redness/watery eyes relief eye drops to wash it out and calm and it will be fine. (*Actually, I noticed if I use eye drops every night to rinse after cleaning the eye make up and applying night treatment, I wake up with well rested looking eyes, no red veins, watery eye lids and less saggy under eye area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was treating with this serum a wide area around my eyes, around the eye lids but not on them, area between eyebrows, forehead, chicks, and jaw/neck area. First week, I saw nothing, and after serum was absorbed, my skin was dry and needed moisturizer. But I never stopped applying it before moisturizer. It was cold winter, and I was just repeating the same thing each day not paying much attention until recently I saw the difference...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I look in the mirror in the morning, I see my younger face, especially nice and fresh before any make up! Areas on my face seems to filled up, and my face looks smoother, glowing, and feels soft and hydrated. Skin on my forehead seems more tight and those 2 wrinkles we all get between eyebrows when worried or getting mad seem less visible, which makes face expression different in a positive way! I usually get confused for a younger age, but this time I&#x27;m the one seeing the difference! It was a really cold winter, I was just using cosmetics and wrapping my self, but these days spring and sun arrived, and when I look at my self, it&#x27;s the same with me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using some vegan and natural cosmetics for a while, but did nothing to my face but making it sticky or looking more tired each day. This line seems like has some kind of reverse effect. I&#x27;m using it for a while now without interruption with any other brands, and I&#x27;m really happy with it. Not to mentionthe price for the effect. Maybe my skin type just loves this thing, I have very dry, thin skin, but I would sincerely recommend at least to give a chance to this product :-)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the product package and quantity, it looks like it&#x27;s not going to last for long, but it&#x27;s have been 40 days since I&#x27;m using it, a lot, and it&#x27;s still running... design looks kind of cool as well.the price for the effect.

    <li> I like this product; not sure if it helps with the wrinkles, but makes my face very soft.  I have repurchased it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product and it actually looked promising the first two days of use. I used it as directed: &amp;#34;apply every morning and evening. Dispense a few drops on fingertips and gently massage over entire face, concentrating on areas as needed intil thoroughly absorbed.&amp;#34;  Even after the very first use, I could see a difference in my fine lines being more hydrated and slightly less pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, on the third day I awoke to red, slightly raised bumps on my cheeks and bridge of my nose.  There was nothing else I changed in my facial routine. I stopped using it until the bumps went away.  It took about 4 days to fully resolve. I decided to try this again to verify the reaction.  It only took 24 hours for the same tiny red bumps to appear the second time.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m personally disappointed with this product, but hopefully others will have a better experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this serum on my face, hands, and neck. It contains hyaluronic acid, which lubricates your skin, plumping it up and keeping it from drying out as it ages. It doesn&#x27;t take much hyaluronic acid in a product to be effective. I can actually see the difference in two problem areas under my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure how to get the serum out of the container, but you just punch the button on the bottom of the container, priming it until it starts coming out. You don&#x27;t remove anything or turn anything. It&#x27;s actually easier than I had thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum goes on easily and leaves skin feeling soft, almost a little sticky, but if it plumps things up, it&#x27;s worth it. It appears to work, so I can deal with a little stickiness.  I suggest giving this serum a try, but also give it a little time to do its work. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s supposed to provide instant results.</li>
    <li> THE GOOD: This is a nice drugstore serum with hyaluronic acid. It has a light texture like most serums. It has a strong fragrance but that goes away quickly. On cleaned dry skin I massaged some of this product into half of my face. It is very silky and hydrating. I can see the difference between the two side especially the thin skin right under and around my eyes and cheek bones. I&#x27;m not saying that I immediately look younger or my fine lines went away as I do not believe that any moisturizer can turn back the hands of time. But I will say the skin on the side I tried the serum on did look fresher and more quenched almost immediately--bouncier than the other side. I put some on the rest of my face and followed up with my regular SPF moisturizer and make-up routine. My make-up went on fine and stayed on the entire day like it normally does. There was no reaction that changed my foundation color, which is good news for me. After about a week of use, I haven&#x27;t noticed any skin reactions like redness, sensitivity, or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD: I&#x27;m not crazy about the packaging. Sure it is beautiful and looks fancy...but I like simple things. I like my creams, moisturizers, and other beauty products to come in easy to open jars, tubs, bottles, and pumps that I can open to look inside and be able to get all the product out. I don&#x27;t like how much packaging was used for so little serum in this product. It&#x27;s overkill and I don&#x27;t know if it is recyclable. I would feel guilty putting this in the trash when I&#x27;m done. I usually go for products like Philosophy, Fresh, Tarte, Neutrogena, Olay, Aveeno, St. Ives because they are great products that come in simple packaging that feels more environmentally friendly to me. And I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m paying more money for fancy and bulky packaging that will just be thrown away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been really dry in my neck of the woods lately (I sleep with the humidifier on). Last night when I applied the serum to  my face, my face was burning and itching uncomfortable especially the sensitive thin area around my nose. I tried to go to sleep but couldn&#x27;t. I had to wash my face and put on my baby&#x27;s moisturizer instead. I probably have micro cracks in my skin from the dry weather but I just wanted to come update and warn people not to apply to broken skin.itching uncomfortable especially the sensitive thin area around my nose.

    <li> I have yet to find a serum I love and I can&#x27;t say that this one does a lot as far as plumping up my skin.  What this does do for me though is make my foundation look flawlessly smooth, and for that I love it.  This is non sticky and a few drops smooths out and sinks into my skin, making it feel like silk.  The dimethicone allows me to glide my foundation over it, and it looks fantastic, creating a super smooth canvas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a very expensive Estee Lauder product to accomplish the same goal, but this is almost identical to that serum.  I do not expect this to create a huge difference in my skin.  What I do love is that this is non sticky and smooths my makeup.  It also has some \\&quot;brighteners\\&quot;, that micro fine glitter they use to reflect light, and that also does help me on days when my skin looks less that \\&quot;bright\\&quot;.  I will continue to use this and like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Yes this is my second buy I see some decrease in lines.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a spring chicken but my skin as always been pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;My problem is right around my lips.</li>
    <li> A lot of hype without the results!</li>
    <li> Me: Late 40&#x27;s with dry, sensitive skin. My main complaint is this serum is HIGHLY FRAGRANCED with a floral perfume scent. I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrance in skincare and it took a LONG time for the odor to dissipate. I ended up with a headache it&#x27;s so bad. This also has an odd way of dispensing the serum. When you first open it, it almost looks like you&#x27;re supposed to break off the tip (but don&#x27;t!). You pump the serum out by pressing on the bottom of the vial. The problem for me is when I went to put the cap back on, holding the bottom of the vial dispenses more serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing I have to say is the serum soaks in fairly fast and there&#x27;s no stickiness unless you use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So does it work? I won&#x27;t be able to tell because the odor is so strong I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> It is OK, it feel cool and almost soothing to put on and it seems to stay there. As for plumping, I can&#x27;t really tell any difference so I can&#x27;t say it has plumped anything on my face. I haven&#x27;t been using it for a long time so I will have to post back at a later date if I notice any difference. It has not caused me any harm, no reactions or breakouts. I really can&#x27;t recommend it for plumping but it is not unpleasant. so make your own decision if you want to try this. I will post back in a months time if I see any changes.</li>
    <li> I use Estee Lauder Enlighten and Night Repair serums; the L&#x27;oreal is NOT that beast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice anything different after a week of using this, with the exception that my skin feels really smooth immediately after application. It has to be the silicone in the product that allows it to have that slip. Just a temporarly feeling though and not something that really seems to be doing me any good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using the Estee Lauder.</li>
    <li> This is a non sticky serum that is cheaper than many other serums out there. I use serums as base before makeup in summer and for night time care in winter and add moisturizer as serum alone does not control winter dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Revitalift serum has water and glycerine as the first 2 ingredients followed by denatured alcohol which perhaps is needed to make it non sticky and give it that cooling feel. It has the salt of hyaluronic acid dissolved in it, typically that acid repairs surface cells. It has many filler products like silica, also silicone products that are meant to be &#x27;plumpers&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a fairly chemical concoction like most serums are, and it does help to smooth skin and replenish some of the damage. But I&#x27;ve found with most serums that they&#x27;re effective only as long as you use them. This one seems no different but I will report back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on the dispenser. It is an injection type of mechanism where you press on the bottom to dispense some serum directly on your face, at least I dispense a drop on each cheek and then massage it in with a light touch using my fingertips. Though it&#x27;s non messy and gets less on my hands and more on the face, I don&#x27;t really like this mechanism as some times I get a bigger blob than at other times. It also seems like this will be difficult to dispense if you are suffering from any pain in wrist or hand. Even now the bottle is so long so I position with one hand and press with other. Though this packaging looks cool I prefer the dropper type mechanism much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For longer term vital looking elastic skin one has to follow the age-old remedies of getting enough sleep, drinking enough water especially in winter, not putting a lot of steam or taking baths with hot water (warm is ok), good eating habits, some healthy vitamins, always cleansing and moisturizing face at night. If you&#x27;re doing all that this serum will give a little added boost. I have been using Olay Regenerist  off and on but feel that they have changed the formulation as it no longer seems as effective as it was when it was launched. So I will try this serum for a few more days and see if it changes anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - After using this serum and the related moisturizer exclusively for a 7 days I started getting a pimple or two, seems like this serum is blocking my pores, I have discontinued use at night but continuing to use in the daytime.he formulation as it no longer seems as effective as it was when it was launched.

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many beauty products for wrinkles etc.  They basically all do the same thing,  they  plump your skin  so that the wrinkles aren&#x27;t noticed as much.  This product  doesn&#x27;t feel sticky,  it feels cool.  It comes with an  easy to use dispenser which puts just the right amount onto your fingertips.  I  apply the product twice a day, in the morning and evening.  It does a good job in plumping my skin and reduces the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> The packaging is interesting, I&#x27;ll give them that. It works like a syringe. Unfortunately, my skin felt drier after using this serum. And applying (very necessary) moisturizer, even hours later, resulted in a &amp;#34;pilling&amp;#34; effect that made my face look dirty because of all the sticky bits all over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed no &amp;#34;plumping,&amp;#34; or anything other than making my skin feel strangely like leather. Not crazy about this product at all.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this product.&lt;br /&gt;First, I do not like the container&#x27;s design. The control button, the pumper, is on the bottom, and it is really easy to accidentally push it and waste some gel. A simple narrow tube would have been a far better choice.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I have not really noticed any results appearance-wise, though my skin feels very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Third, I never noticed any stickiness. The gel glides on easily and is absorbed quickly.&lt;br /&gt;They suggest you use it with the moisturizer to get the full benefit. I have been using them together, and, like another reviewer, believe this is a long term project. I don&#x27;t think you see quick results.&lt;br /&gt;I love the Revitalift line and have been using their regular moisturizer for some time with great results: evening out skin tone and keeping everything hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;If anything changes I will add to this review.</li>
    <li> On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t make my skin break out or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the cons side, it didn&#x27;t do anything to improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  If anything, I think the fine lines around my eyes seemed *more* pronounced than before.  I normally use a department store serum, and using this product for a few days instead of my usual made me feel a lot better about shelling out $$$ for my department store serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s better than nothing for some people.  But I&#x27;m not one of them.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product. It still feels like it remains on my face after applying, but I feel that way about almost all of these products, even the ones that claim to blend in and not leave residue. Still it seems to work well, though I guess time will tell. Will update after a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> What a large package for 0.5 ounces!  This product does seem to plump my wrinkles and it absorbs well, though. The applicator is a bit bizarre, resembling a syringe.</li>
    <li> This is an okay product, but I don&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;volume loss&amp;#34; interaction or wrinkle reduction it talks about. I&#x27;m a little skeptical because of the packaging. The shape of the &amp;#34;needle like&amp;#34; bottle seems like they&#x27;re trying too hard to convince us this is going to be like botox or some professional treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this as a serum under my daily moisturizer and it worked okay but didn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
    <li> Really does help fill in some of the deep wrinkles.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I have some fine lines around my eyes, this did nothing for them, I don&#x27;t think my skin is thin and needs collagen, so maybe this isn&#x27;t for me. I use a clarsonic brush &amp; glymed products, I have also had 3 vitalize peels in the past 100 days. I&#x27;m 40, my skin is pretty fabulous. This felt nice going on but this was pretty disappointing. The box and description talk about hyaluronic acid but it&#x27;s not even in the first 3 listed ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t given this 4 weeks, so if I see something change, I will revise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;AQUA / WATER, GLYCERIN, ALCOHOL DENAT., DIMETHICONE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL, SILICA, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ALPINIA GALANGA LEAF EXTRACT, CARBOMER, METHYLSILANOL/SILICATE CROSSPOLYMER, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, AMMONIUM POLYACRYLDIMETHYLTAURAMIDE / AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE, DIPOTASSIUM GLYCYRRHIZATE, DISODIUM EDTA, CAPRYLOYL SALICYLIC ACID, LINALOOL, CITRONELLOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, BENZYL BENZOATE, BENZYL SALICYLATE, PARFUM / FRAGRANCE</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Hyaluronic acid, but good luck finding any in this! It seems like it is mostly a bunch of chemical ingredients that would not be good for anyone with sensitive skin (like me). My recommendation is to get pure hyaluronic acid, which is much cheaper, and mix it with a little coconut oil or argan oil. You&#x27;ll have better results without the risk of irritation.</li>
    <li> I like many of the L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift products.  They seem to be well thought out products that do good things for your skin.  This serum is wonderfully light, and hydrates your skin very well.  I think that some small lines are made smaller visibly with this product.  I like to use this after my toner and before my primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see dramatic results.  I am sure I will continue to see good results, I know  it will take time.  I think the package is overkill.  It seems like a lot of plastic that encases a small amount of product.  I like that it isn&#x27;t in a jar, but I think this would have been just as good if it came out of a tube.</li>
</ol>
