      <li>Great pigmentation and blendability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and i loved it.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous.  </li>
      <li>Completely gorgeous.  </li>
      <li>I love maybelline products and this came wrapped great so as to no breaking of the eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>Just make sure your colouring allows for it!</li>
      <li>This is nice BUT not the color I ordered.</li>
      <li>, I get many compliments when i use it.</li>
      <li>Love the colors.</li>
      <li>Pretty colors, nice teal hues</li>
      <li>Light.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap, which is good, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s only perfect quality for those who like a little bit of faded color when applied; for people who like a not-too-visible eyeshadow on.</li>
      <li>Love it , I have always used three colors to do my eyes , nice now that companies sell a quad I will enjoy using the third color to enhance my eyes</li>
      <li>the shades of blue made my blue eyes pop and created a very beautiful color smokey eye.</li>
      <li>I always feel so pretty when I wear this eyeshadow!</li>
      <li>Super I like this product ,they sent too fast</li>
      <li>The colors have great contrast and the liner is a very deep blue, so it really brings a lot of attention to my eyes without looking cakey or overdone.</li>
      <li>They are awesome colors, but it&#x27;s very thin when put on.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>reasonable cost.</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly, very patchy look, when applied.</li>
      <li>What I ordered was light blue, 2 different purple and gray on the bottom.</li>

    <li> Best choice and best price</li>
    <li> This quad is absolutely beautiful.  That navy blue there?  Gorgeous.  Completely gorgeous.  Great pigmentation and blendability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately,  I forgot that I can&#x27;t wear darker blues without looking like I have a black eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall there&#x27;s nothing wrong with this set.  Just make sure your colouring allows for it!</li>

    <li> Hard to find color @ reasonable cost. Bought for a friend she was very happy</li>
    <li> I received this from June&#x27;s Attic.  It had been opened and the applicators were missing.  It is to much trouble to send this item back.  I would not order from June&#x27;s Attic again.</li>
    <li> They are awesome colors, but it&#x27;s very thin when put on. I personally like it when I see the color in the container, and it&#x27;s the exact same color when I apply, but it&#x27;s a very thin eyeshadow. Light. Not so visible. The blue may look dark, but when put on, it&#x27;s not so visible. It&#x27;s cheap, which is good, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s only perfect quality for those who like a little bit of faded color when applied; for people who like a not-too-visible eyeshadow on.

    <li> great colors, great value, great Price. I like this shadow, I get many compliments when i use it. The quality is good!</li>
    <li> It just doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly, very patchy look, when applied. The colors appear totally different on the eye than they look in the palette. I was just not satisfied with the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> I did a makeup tutorial on youtube featuring an inexpensive product (the maybelline Sapphire Smokes)I can&#x27;t get over how beautiful these colors are! Even though this quad looks blue, my makeup turned out like a grey smokey eye. If you want to see these colors in person check out my video.    [...]</li>
