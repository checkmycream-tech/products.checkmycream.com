      <li>Today when you look at my nails they have a more normal appearance.  </li>

      <li>Before I first bought this product, I read customer reviews, and people would say they saw a change immediately.  </li>
      <li>Pretty pricey for a product that doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
      <li>I was well aware of the benefits of this product and felt the company was reputable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got my first bottle thru my nail artist.  </li>

      <li>The ridging and splitting is very subdued now.</li>
      <li>Really helps if you&#x27;re trying to maximize the time between manicures.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Not quite but the use of this oil is a tremendous boost in getting them back</li>
      <li>This is one of those things I just can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
      <li>When I don&#x27;t use this, my cuticles look dry and rough and after applying this product, my nails look 100% better, even if I have no polish on them.  </li>
      <li>I bought the large bottle and refill my smaller polish sized bottle that I carry with me during the day.  </li>
      <li>I can really tell a big difference</li>
      <li>So far, after six months of use</li>
      <li>/&gt;Solar Oil is made up of natural and synthetic products.</li>
      <li>FOR ME, THIS WAS NOT A GUARANTEE WITH SUCH HIGH CHARGES FOR RETURN.</li>

<li> It just takes a tiny bit so will last a long time.  </li>
<li> and I bite so less frequently that my nails are starting to grow.</li>
<li> Second time I purchased it and will do so again when I run out, which won&#x27;t be anytime soon since this bottle of oil lasts a long, long time.  </li>
<li> and they said it is not working as other same product I had given before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I got it to help with dry cuticles and it does the job.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s always dry in my home.  </li>
<li> just seem to be dry.</li>
<li> I bought the larger bottle because the small one wasn&#x27;t enough for me!</li>
<li> This bottle is round as the photo indicates and makes applying it an easier process than trying to use those tiny bottles.  </li>
<li> I spent $108.</li>
<li> SPENT FOR JUNK.  </li>
<li> I have tried other oils, don&#x27;t bother.  </li>
<li> My nails were extremely ridged and split.  </li>
<li> I gave some to other&#x27;s</li>
<li> Solar oil is a little pricey -</li>
<li> I do wish it came in a smaller bottle, not the tiny one, because it&#x27;s hard to,finish the bottle before it takes on a stale scent.</li>
<li> I have been using this product for a few months.</li>
<li> Less hang nails, nicer looking finger tips when you use this product!</li>
<li> I use this with Sally Hansen Hard as Nails.</li>
<li> MY COMPLAINT:</li>
<li> this formula, is not the same and my nails have turned ugly.</li>
<li> I had tried other brands - some very expensive but they didn&#x27;t seem to help my nails and cuticles.</li>
<li> It is not an overnight fix, but my fingernails have made a dramatic change.  </li>
<li> MAY RECONSIDER DOING BUSINESS WITH AMAZON, AS THIS SUPPLIER STINKS.</li>
<li> I have a bad habit of biting my nails</li>
<li> You will not be disappointed with this product and the affordable price</li>
<li> I have always had a terrible time with my nails...</li>

    <li> I have always had a terrible time with my nails...until now. This stuff is magical! Worth the $$</li>
    <li> Great product, it has kept my cracked callused cuticles soft and painless</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It kind of stinks that you have to apply it 2x&#x27;s a day in order to get the best effect, but other than that it&#x27;s a great product. Really helps if you&#x27;re trying to maximize the time between manicures. Less hang nails, nicer looking finger tips when you use this product!</li>
    <li> This is one of those things I just can&#x27;t live without.  I used to buy a nail oil from QVC which came in a tiny bottle and was much more expensive until I found out about CND&#x27;s Solar Oil.  You can also purchase this at CVS but you will pay more for it.  I bought the large bottle and refill my smaller polish sized bottle that I carry with me during the day.  When I don&#x27;t use this, my cuticles look dry and rough and after applying this product, my nails look 100% better, even if I have no polish on them.  You will not be disappointed with this product and the affordable price Amazon sells it for.</li>
    <li> MY COMPLAINT: Item: Creative Nail Design Solar Oil 2.3oz&lt;br /&gt; Qty: 5&lt;br /&gt; Return reason: Defective/Does not work properly&lt;br /&gt; Buyer comments: I have had sucess with this, and I love it. this formula, is not the same and my nails have turned ugly. I gave some to other&#x27;s and they said it is not working as other same product I had given before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi Barbara&lt;br /&gt; No problem for the return just sent it back to us , when we receive  the package we will refund the amount of the item for you , but we will take of the shipping cost is $2.50.

And we will take of all the charge from the amount of the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your business with us&lt;br /&gt; You have a good day.  Q Nails Supply Staffs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHO WOULD ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN? NOT OF COURSE! I HAD GIVEN THESE AS GIFTS SO THEY WERE OPENED AND RETURNED TO ME. I spent $108. SPENT FOR JUNK.  MAY RECONSIDER DOING BUSINESS WITH AMAZON, AS THIS SUPPLIER STINKS. FOR ME, THIS WAS NOT A GUARANTEE WITH SUCH HIGH CHARGES FOR RETURN. Thanks.</li>
    <li> great product with super quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love the solar oil?! The bottle alone is awesome. :) My cuticles are in much better shape when I apply this morning and night.</li>
    <li> Solar oil is a little pricey - but I love this bottle because it comes with the eye dropper.  I might refill with a lower cost oil in the future.</li>
    <li> This works amazingly well to keep my nails from peeling and cracking.  It just takes a tiny bit so will last a long time.  And it smells good.</li>
    <li> I have a bad habit of biting my nails and I&#x27;m trying to stop. This oil helps to nourish the cuticles a lot, so I don&#x27;t have hangnails and I bite so less frequently that my nails are starting to grow. I use this with Sally Hansen Hard as Nails. I apply 2-3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they had in pen format so I could take on my purse with me. I bought the larger bottle because the small one wasn&#x27;t enough for me! Tip: don&#x27;t buy the Solar balm though, it&#x27;s gross.</li>
    <li> I have tried other oils, don&#x27;t bother.  This is the best.  I have had gels nails, fingers and toes for years.  This oil hides any lifting edges and helps to heal cuticles.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t praise this product enough.  My nails were extremely ridged and split.  I have used Solar Oil twice a day on my nails for almost one year.  Before I first bought this product, I read customer reviews, and people would say they saw a change immediately.  I knew better than to expect that.  It is not an overnight fix, but my fingernails have made a dramatic change.  The ridging and splitting is very subdued now. Today when you look at my nails they have a more normal appearance.  Thank you Solar Oil.</li>
    <li> This oil is awesome and smells amazing.  I got it to help with dry cuticles and it does the job.  I use it daily as we use our air conditioner 24/7 here and it&#x27;s always dry in my home.  Second time I purchased it and will do so again when I run out, which won&#x27;t be anytime soon since this bottle of oil lasts a long, long time.  Great value!</li>
    <li> Package Arrived in great shaie</li>
    <li> After having solar nails on for several months, I decided to get them off.  As always when you have these taken off, there is damage to your own nail bed.  I couldn&#x27;t find the big bottle of Solar Oil anywhere in town, so ordering it from Amazon was a blessing in disguise.&lt;br /&gt;Are my nails back to \\&quot;normal\\&quot;?  Not quite but the use of this oil is a tremendous boost in getting them back that way.&lt;br /&gt;And, it smells wonderful while you are creating a healthy nail &amp; cuticle area.&lt;br /&gt;Patricia Sutton</li>
    <li> I read a review that this particular nail oil was good for dry nails. I had tried other brands - some very expensive but they didn&#x27;t seem to help my nails and cuticles. This one does!  The bottle was larger than I thought it would be so great value for the money!</li>
    <li> Best cuticle treatment ever! I do wish it came in a smaller bottle, not the tiny one, because it&#x27;s hard to,finish the bottle before it takes on a stale scent.</li>
    <li> I have used this for almost 4 months and have not noticed a different in nails or cuticles.  I used it between 2-4 times a day on hand and toes. Pretty pricey for a product that doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, good size and does the job.</li>
    <li> rec&#x27;d it quickly and it is great!this is great for hands, feet elbows have been using it for years love it</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months. I do think it helps but since my nails all grow with ridges it is not a cure.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil when recommended by others who use shellac nail polish.  If I use it daily my cuticles are nice and smooth.  I can quickly tell when I have forgotten to use it.  I would recommend this product to others using the shellac system and to those who just want to have nice cuticles.</li>
    <li> I got my first bottle thru my nail artist.  And saw that Amazon has it as well.  So orered another bottle.  I keep on in the to put on my nails while the car warms up.  The second bottle is upstairs to put on before I go to bed and when I get up.  Am planning on a third bottle soon!  I have tried so many different kinds and this one is hands down the best.</li>
    <li> Love this product, smell good (almond)</li>
    <li> Helps but still have a problem with my cuticles and&lt;br /&gt;nails. Have tried using it several times a day but&lt;br /&gt;I just seem to be dry.</li>
    <li> I have used solar oil off and on for several years to nourish my nails.  However, when I decided to start doing the CND Shellac polish system at home one of the motivating factors was that it was made by the same company that produces Solar Oil.  I was well aware of the benefits of this product and felt the company was reputable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since starting the Shellac process I have been determined to use the Solar Oil as recommended.  One of the reasons it is recommended is that the Shellac system is the only one that after curing it leaves tiny tunnels in the product so that the solar oil can actually penetrate to the nail bed.  This is a big motivating factor for me.  I started doing this process to hopefully repair my peeling and cracking nails.  So far, after six months of use I can really tell a big difference and I think Solar Oil has been one of the leading factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, you will use a lot of Solar Oil if you use it as directed on fingers and toes daily.  I wanted to find the best bargain I could and fortunately found this large bottle economically priced on Amazon.com.  This bottle is round as the photo indicates and makes applying it an easier process than trying to use those tiny bottles.  This one sits on its own and there is no fear of it turning over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solar Oil is made up of natural and synthetic products. Smells divine and although oily when going on quickly is soaked up by your nails and surrounding cuticle areas.</li>
    <li> Creative Solar Oil really helps keep my nails from being dry. It comes with a big brush which covers most of your nail that is a plus.</li>
