      <li>This product is really nice.  </li>
      <li>So they all carry their own version of this product and I have tried them all</li>
      <li>I bought it for myself for when I have to do my own hair.  </li>
      <li>This was my own fault</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
      <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t spend more!</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine, and this product helps build volume.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair, but a lot of it.  </li>
      <li>It gives my fine hair the body it needs!  </li>
      <li>I have lots of fine hair, and this stuff is magic!</li>
      <li>It allows me to skip washing my hair more often and does boost the volume of my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even sure how I did that.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the way this powder works.  </li>
      <li>I love this powder for getting max volume to your hair.</li>
      <li>This has its benefits, though; I had my hair styled at 7 pm and was able to continue styling and restyling for over 24 hours after.</li>
      <li>Much better than spray or gel products.</li>
      <li>As in, you might want to wash your hair twice to make sure you get it all out.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love, love, love this powder...</li>
      <li>So forming a fohawk with my hair and having it stay there AND being able to deconstruct it and do something else minutes or hours later is impressive.</li>
      <li>It add volume and body without the stickiness of most mousses/gels.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fuller and more manageable to style when applied at the roots of my hair.  </li>
      <li>My stylist calls it slippery. :-)  </li>
      <li>I just love this product</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>we just got this new product in and it is amazing!</li>
      <li>the powder is easy to inhale and makes you feel choked.</li>
      <li>My hair is so easy to style and it maintains its shape throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Would probably make sense to shampoo with something like Neutrogena Clean or another extra-cleaning shampoo to be sure you get it all out.</li>
      <li>If you have fine hair, this is the product for you.  </li>
      <li>Works really week-gives fine hair nice volume</li>
      <li>a great product to &amp;#34;fluff up&#x27; short hair!</li>
      <li>Great for adding extra body and lift!</li>
      <li>gives great lift to my short funky hairstyle</li>
      <li>Thanks Redkin for an amazing product.</li>
      <li>Nothing spectacular, really.</li>
      <li>When you first style your hair it looks pretty good.  </li>
      <li>It adds that extra \\&quot;grab\\&quot; to your hair, and I can see this working perfectly for updo&#x27;s without having to resort to using so much hairspray.  </li>
      <li>, Loreal owns many professional product lines, like Redken, Matrix, Bed Head, Sexy Hair, etc.  </li>
      <li>First of all, I have healthy hair that usually looks good on its own.</li>
      <li>So, I don&#x27;t use it except for special occasions.</li>
      <li>I went for a cut and style for a special occasion, and she used this product.  </li>
      <li>I wish there was a true Blond color, maybe there is, but did not find it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hilarious really.</li>
      <li>My stylist used this product on my baby fine hair for the first time today, talk about fullness and lift.</li>
      <li>Would not recommend unless it was going to be washed out quickly.</li>
      <li>Super glad my hairdresser showed me this product, as it really helps in making my hair do exactly what I want it to do.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it blends nicely with my dark hair and gives me the volume without spending all the time teasing my hair.  </li>
      <li>I like the way it can be used in curly or straight styles!!</li>
      <li>This is great stuff to thicken up your hair in those spots where it needs a little boost.  </li>
      <li>Amazing is the only word to describe it.  </li>
      <li>It has been worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I have super fine, soft hair.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair much easier to style and stay full looking even on rainy days.</li>
      <li>and I think I&#x27;m using a lot more than some of the other folks who have reviewed it here, but a tiny bottle of it lasted me a good 6+ months.</li>
      <li>Just put a dab on the root and you&#x27;ll be surprised at how easily your hair can be styled.</li>
      <li>You sprinkle a little on the top of your head (near the roots)and kind of tousle your hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I chose this product for its mattifying effect, meaning that it took the oily look out of my hair. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the volume in my hair increased as well. It doesn&#x27;t require covering the whole head to get the mattifying effect, either.The powder is white and my hair is dark, but all of the powder brushed out very easily.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it blends nicely with my dark hair and gives me the volume without spending all the time teasing my hair.  I have also accidently inhaled this and it burned my nose a little.  This was my own fault cause I squeezed the bottle instead of shaking it like a salt shaker.  If you squeeze the bottle you can over do it, and waste the product.  It does give your hair a tacky feel, so I lift up sections and shake it at the root.  This keeps from making my hair feel to tacky on the surface.  If you follow this method, you (or your boyfriend) can run fingers through your hair and never feel the difference.  Best part is it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itchy like hair spray or root spray, and gives me better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Professional Cosmetologist insider tip, Loreal owns many professional product lines, like Redken, Matrix, Bed Head, Sexy Hair, etc.  So they all carry their own version of this product and I have tried them all and I can&#x27;t tell the difference.  They look and feel the same.  So buy the cheaper with confidence knowing it is the same product.  The only exception is the Alterna Bamboo Powder, which is organic bamboo.</li>
    <li> This stuff gives my hair so much texture and let&#x27;s me style it however I want without being heavy or greasy. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love, love, love this powder... As I have gotten older my hair has thinned. I needed a long overdue makeover not simply because of thinner hair but for a spiritual and emotional uplift as well.  I found a great stylist and she is always in touch with the latest styles and products... She is amazing! I wanted an edgy look and she has given me several with slight changes... so easy to care for and easy to style. Recently I went in with a picture of a style I loved and my only reservation was how do i get the volume and puff I need for the style? the worst thing you can do is get a new hairstyle and it look bad. She said no problem we just got this new product in and it is amazing! She was correct! She styled my hair with it and I was shocked at how great it looked....was this really me? Wow! I was sold! It is so easy to use, simply lift your hair, sprinkle and brush through after styling, flat ironing or whatever and fluff it up...Voila! Magic! The next day it just run your fingers through your hair and go....it works to restyle your hair in a few minutes....amazing! I look ten years younger and I owe it all to Redken and Melissa! Thanks you..</li>
    <li> helps my thinning blond hair, covers the scalp, but it is white. I wish there was a true Blond color, maybe there is, but did not find it</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders for getting you volume without having to tease your hair!  Sprinkle a little on your roots at the crown for volume, or even as a texturizer on the surface of your hair for sculpting layers.  It adds that extra \\&quot;grab\\&quot; to your hair, and I can see this working perfectly for updo&#x27;s without having to resort to using so much hairspray.  I love using it to hold braids, since my slick hair does not normally keep braids and slides out of elastics.  Super glad my hairdresser showed me this product, as it really helps in making my hair do exactly what I want it to do.</li>
    <li> Seems to damage hair. Very harsh but it will keep your hair volume up all day if not wet.</li>
    <li> gives great lift to my short funky hairstyle</li>
    <li> If you possess shiny flat hair that only wants to lay against your head, this product will help you make it retain some shape other than flat. Sprinkle it on, brush it, boom. Poor or puff and thick column. Hard to run your fingers through but shape of hair is set for the night. I think it may be cornstarch....whatever it is, it works.</li>
    <li> First off, I sorta like the big hair witch look.  I&#x27;ve got really long hair, and it sorta hangs, but I use this powder and suddenly my hair is sticking out 3-4 inches from the roots.  It&#x27;s hilarious really. I&#x27;m ready to go play a lion in a play.  It REALLY delivers on the volume.&lt;br /&gt;I probably wouldn&#x27;t wear it out like this - except for at Halloween - with my crazy long wavy hair DOWN, it just looks like TOO MUCH hair - but this rocks an updo for me.&lt;br /&gt;My husband doesn&#x27;t think it is sticky at all.  I think it is sticky, and if I touch my hair, I think it feels dirty - but it&#x27;s not as bad as spraying your roots with hairspray or gel.  It&#x27;s more natural than other products.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t breath while applying it though, I made that mistake and the powder is easy to inhale and makes you feel choked. I&#x27;m not even sure how I did that.&lt;br /&gt;It looks pretty white - and my hair is very light blonde so you can&#x27;t see it, but it might show on dark hair?  I&#x27;d try to get a sample first or maybe find a review from someone with dark hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! No more teasing for body for me!! I use my finger to part hair horizontally and sprinkle the powder on my scalp/roots are.  Lay my hair back down and rub the area to creat body. Works great!</li>
    <li> I have lots of fine hair, and this stuff is magic! Sprinkle a little at the roots, and you can make your hair do anything. Be careful not to breathe it in, though!</li>
    <li> Works really week-gives fine hair nice volume</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, but a lot of it.  This product keeps my hair from going flat or doing its &amp;#34;own thing&amp;#34;.  Keeps lift for days.</li>
    <li> Just the best think to help fluff up thin hair like mine.  Makes my hair much easier to style and stay full looking even on rainy days.</li>
    <li> awesome for adding volume to the crown. be careful when applying it, you can always go back and add more! try not to inhale it either, it&#x27;ll make you cough</li>
    <li> Just as an FYI, the package size is about equivalent to a trial or travel size deodorant, but you really don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to and I plan to buy it again!</li>
    <li> This works but for me it is hard to wash out of my hair- after shampooing I still seem to have a little residue. Would probably make sense to shampoo with something like Neutrogena Clean or another extra-cleaning shampoo to be sure you get it all out.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this Redken Powder Grip 03 with my last haircut and style. I have thin, fine, graying hair. I was amazed at the volume this product gave my hair. I purchased the product and brought it home. I was a little skeptical, but I was truly thrilled when I found out that I could style my hair so easily after years of never feeling like I could get my haircut to look as the stylist did. Great product! I&#x27;m thrilled to find it on Amazon, and it&#x27;s on Prime! Just put a dab on the root and you&#x27;ll be surprised at how easily your hair can be styled. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Redken Powder Grip is one of the best discoveries I have made!  Using just a sprinkle here and there in the crown, makes my hair have the most amazing styling ability!  It gives my fine hair the body it needs!  I will continue to use this product!!</li>
    <li> This product gives the hair instant body and it&#x27;s very easy to use. Just sprinkle a little on roots of hair (a little goes a long way) and massage into the hair. Instantly gives the hair volume. Yes, it does make your hair feel dirty but I wash my hair frequently and this product helps to volumize my fine, limp hair. Recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> It did hold my hair style and give it more body, but I didn&#x27;t expect the feeling of powder in my hair to last as long as it did. Maybe that&#x27;s a result of my expectations! At first, I thought I would have to wash my hair again the same day but later got used to the feeling and began to appreciate the produce more. I will probably purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Need lift and staying power, well a little bit of this and you have it.  The tiniest bit does it.</li>
    <li> I did not like the change to the texture of my .  I expected it to be more like other products that when combed through was not detectable.  I could not stand my hair and washed i out that night.</li>
    <li> Gives my thin hair lift!  A friend recommended it and I love it.  Only a little product is needed to give you body all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it as a dry shampoo. It allows me to skip washing my hair more often and does boost the volume of my hair.</li>
    <li> Great for adding extra body and lift! Sprinkle a little on the roots, rub in with your fingertips and see the lift!</li>
    <li> Powder does give body to my fine thin hair.  It is very expensive for what it does and makes my hair feel awful.  Would not recommend unless it was going to be washed out quickly.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this when it first came out.  This product is amazing.  If this was available when I was young and my mom forced me to wear &amp;#34;pixy cuts&amp;#34;, I would have never complained.  My hair is fuller and more manageable to style when applied at the roots of my hair.  Great stuff.  Lasts forever since a little of this powder goes a long, long way.  Would recommend to anyone with very fine, limp hair not matter what length.  Thanks Redkin for an amazing product.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff to thicken up your hair in those spots where it needs a little boost.  Expensive most places.  Best price here.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was reviewed on a blog I read and highly recommended. My hair is thick but has no body and this is supposed to make it feel thicker and give it body. I found it to do that, but it made my hair feel matted, dirty, and very uncomfortable. I used it once and that was enough. The container is tiny, so it&#x27;s quite pricy for what you get. I might just as well have thrown my $12.00 in the trash. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> I really like this product - I have really baby fine thin hair and this gives me so much body&lt;br /&gt;and the curl wll hold in my hair all day.  Good Product.</li>
    <li> MUCH smaller than expected. I often question whether or not this was filled entirely or I got scammed. Hard to tell. But the quality is still great.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this wonderful product.  It add volume and body without the stickiness of most mousses/gels. I could not find it in the store, and was delighted that Amazon carries it.</li>
    <li> I saw a beauty makeover on the local tv station, and the hairdresser was using a similar product on a short hairdo.  I was intrigued.  So, I ordered this product.  I am 59 with thinning hair and a short style.  No other product has given me the desired oomph in the back of my hair.  I love it.  It does make your hair feel a bit &amp;#34;yucky&amp;#34;, but it looks anything but!  My daughter borrowed my product for the hairdresser to use on her hair; she was in a wedding and wanted her medium length hair to stay put for the day.  The hairdresser used it on my daughter and the bride.  It gives great control for an &amp;#34;up do&amp;#34;.  You do have to watch it and not apply too much.  A time or two, it has given me an itchy scalp after several hours.  So, I don&#x27;t use it except for special occasions.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. My stylist used this product on my baby fine hair for the first time today, talk about fullness and lift. I was amazed at how beautiful my hair turned out. She said she just learned about it.  If you have fine hair, this is the product for you.  I came straight home, went to amazon.com to find the product and ordered 2 bottles.  You need this product !</li>
    <li> Seemed to be less in this new bottle I received than the one I have had for months. Won&#x27;t order again from them. Ps the cheaper drug store brands work just as well I have come to know.</li>
    <li> I had to find and order this stuff before I ran out.  This just makes your hair feel thicker and moves where you want it.  Where you want lift.  Just part and sprinkle on and rub a little and fix hair.  You can&#x27;t see the product in your hair either.  It doesn&#x27;t move.  The next morning it will still be where you sprinkled it, may be a little matted and need shampooed.</li>
    <li> Works great! My hair is very fine and I couldn&#x27;t tease it before. I wish there was a larger amount available though.</li>
    <li> I like this product when using sparingly. It does create lots of volume. However, make sure its one of the last things you do before setting your style. The  Product will make your hair very difficult to  brush back out once in place. Less is more in this case.  You can&#x27;t beat it for creating the \\&quot;poof\\&quot;  at the crown. I only use it for special occasions and dramatic hair styles.</li>
    <li> It works but doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same quality as this product bought in a legit salon. It&#x27;s the risk you take though!</li>
    <li> i have had so many compliments on my hair when i use this product!</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine, and this product helps build volume. I don&#x27;t use it every day, but when I do it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It works great with my pixie cut. I sprinkle a small amount in, then shape. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky and during the day I can play with the shape and it still works. The bottle is VERY small but you aren&#x27;t supposed to use much and I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month with no sign it is running low.</li>
    <li> I have had some sort of fauxhawk/pixie cut for the last 4 years and have gone through so many hair products to try to create volume in my fine/limp hair, but this product is a game changer for me. It was recommended to me by a stylist with a fauxhawk and I had a hard time believing that it could possibly work. A powder? Really? YES, ABSOLUTELY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprinkle it along the front (holding my hair back), the sides, and the back and I think I&#x27;m using a lot more than some of the other folks who have reviewed it here, but a tiny bottle of it lasted me a good 6+ months. It has been worth every penny. My hair has never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it makes your hair feel a little weird. But people hating it because it made their hair feel dirty? Don&#x27;t touch your hair all day, problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a haircut like mine and are struggling to make it stand up all day, this is the product you want. (I couple mine with spray wax sold by my salon and a shot of hairspray for 18 hour hold).</li>
    <li> i will never use hair spray to bump my hair again the only thing i dont like it the smell but its well worth it!</li>
    <li> This is a nice alternative for adding fullness to dry hair as opposed to using a gel that you must use when your hair is wet,</li>
    <li> I am a hair product junky and this stuff is my go to product every morning! I useit with a teasing comb and it can also be used as a dry shampoo for those no wash days. It is great!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Perfect for volume and and a little lift to make your hair look super thick. I love this product!</li>
    <li> When you first style your hair it looks pretty good.  But soon after it gives up.  My hair fell flat again soon after styling but it did give it some &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to work with and it wasn&#x27;t so soft.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair. This product allows me to add volume and fullness to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, and of course Amazon has to best price. Great value.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is very easy to use and provides a great amount of texture to my roots giving a nice all-day lift.</li>
    <li> Love this hair powder since I have greasy hair and skin, and creams and gels make it worse.  It&#x27;s perfect for my short hair, though I usually have to touch it up (just re-brush) every 4 hours or so, but I think that will be the case with any product.  A little goes a long way, this one container has lasted me several months.</li>
    <li> I have a fab new hair stylist who introduced this to me.  I am lost when it comes to styling my hair.  She shook this powder on my hair and I was like \\&quot;What is that?  What are you doing?\\&quot;  She literally shook it in, rubbed my hair for a second to shake it around and boom----- volume.  My hair is long and thick, so this helps it too look less weighed down.  Amazing stuff.  It feels really weird, but you can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s in your hair.  Totally matte.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> I have super fine, soft hair.  My stylist calls it slippery. :-)  I went for a cut and style for a special occasion, and she used this product.  Amazing is the only word to describe it.  Sprinkle, fluff and get instant volume that lasts ALL DAY.   No exaggeration.  My hair isn&#x27;t as soft, but it doesn&#x27;t feel dirty, either.  Much better than spray or gel products.</li>
    <li> This is the most awesome product and keeps your style in 100% humidity! My daughter punks up her hair...I just like the staying power without helmet hair!</li>
    <li> I am happy with the purchase. This product really \\&quot;grabs\\&quot; your hair, so you only need a very small amount to lift your roots. I have a thin hair and my hairdresser recommended the Powder Grip for my type of hair. I like it.</li>
    <li> a great product to &amp;#34;fluff up&#x27; short hair!</li>
    <li> First of all, I have healthy hair that usually looks good on its own. I&#x27;m not complaining, really. It&#x27;s straight, thick, and heavy and when I let it do its own thing, it looks sleek and nice. But sometimes, I want something different. I don&#x27;t want my hair to look soft and pretty and \\&quot;just so.\\&quot; I want to style my hair and have it stay that way. Every product I&#x27;ve ever used eventually weighs my hair down, works itself out, or makes my hair look stringy and greasy. But this...THIS. My hair guy from back home knows my battle to find a product that can actually style my hair, and he busted out this stuff. Oh. My. God. It works. I have a black, edgy pixie cut and we actually made a fohawk with my hair. Seriously. This stuff has what it takes. I do community theatre and have had to work my hair into weird styles; that usually means about 4 or 5 different products in and on my hair per performance. It&#x27;s disgusting, and never lasts. I loved B &amp; Bs [un]style texturing cream, but that eventually would work its way out. So I&#x27;d have to use hairspray, and I HATE hairspray. I want to be able to run my hands through my hair, and so does my boyfriend, and the other waxes and creams and sprays and whatevers were not good for the hands or the style. So forming a fohawk with my hair and having it stay there AND being able to deconstruct it and do something else minutes or hours later is impressive. That has literally never been done with my hair. This stuff stays in too...forever. As in, you might want to wash your hair twice to make sure you get it all out. This has its benefits, though; I had my hair styled at 7 pm and was able to continue styling and restyling for over 24 hours after. Nothing has done this for me. This is a keeper for giving my pixie options!</li>
    <li> I love this powder for getting max volume to your hair. This is my second bottle, I love it that much! I like the way it can be used in curly or straight styles!!</li>
    <li> I used it like twice and forgot I even bought it. Nothing spectacular, really. My hairdresser recommended it to me. She was selling it for $30 but I bought it here for $9! So glad I didn&#x27;t spend more!</li>
    <li> It added texture and volume just as I had wanted. Did not leave any visible traces. Highly recommend it to others who might need the texture or volume to create fun hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me. It actually made my hair flatter. It seems like straight corn starch but not sure.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and my hairdresser started using this product on me. I can&#x27;t tell  you how much it has helped me out. I bought it for myself for when I have to do my own hair.  I just love this product</li>
    <li> I have a straight bob and used it at the end of the day to give the roots a bit of volume.  Used a tiny amount but it still had kind of a stiff dirty feeling.  My hairdresser used it on me and teased up the roots and it worked great for her.  I never tease my hair at home, so it&#x27;s not going to work for me.</li>
    <li> I love the way this powder works.  My hair is so easy to style and it maintains its shape throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This product is really nice.  You sprinkle a little on the top of your head (near the roots)and kind of tousle your hair and it does give it lift...I did find that I had to apply again during the day though but I would still buy it again.</li>
