      <li>I don&#x60;t find the bronzers to be outstanding.</li>
      <li>Will not buy any more Designer Skin products.</li>
      <li>You will love this lotion.</li>
      <li>But the salon I go to wanted $60.00, so I was very excited when I found it here for this price.</li>
      <li>and if you&#x27;re person who keeps buying from them you will get free gifts if you mention you&#x27;ve ordered from them before &#x3D;)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This lotion is great at providing instant results. It&#x27;s a quad bronzer, so it has DHA in it, along with some shimmer. It smells decent, and leaves no sticky residue. I recommend using this after you have a base tan, only so that you are building your tan and create a more natural, dark look. If you start off with this product, be careful as to not give yourself that fake tan...so start slowy and never put any on your face. Another thing I like about this product is that it gives you a brown tan, rather than orange. This is def a Designer Skin product I would use again!!</li>
    <li> I live down at the coast in Texas, and start tanning in the spring to get a good base tan for the hot summers down here.  I really enjoy this lotion.  All the Designer Skin products are nice.  I have sensitive oily skin, and their products never make me break out or feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worship Me has a nice, light scent, and lighter bronzers.  I am pretty picky with bronzers, and hate the fake look.  I&#x27;ve been using this one for a couple weeks and am pretty pleased with the color.  The bottle says something about a \\&quot;caramel\\&quot; color and that&#x27;s a good description of what I received from it.  The color feels pretty natural.</li>
    <li> I liked this tanning lotion.  It got to my house very fast after ordering.  I will definitely order from here again.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion really works! When you use Worship ME, you&#x27;ll be twice as dark in the same amount of time. Not only that, it improved my skin. My legs were dry and flaky all winter. Nothing seemed to help. Since I started tanning and using Worship Me lotion, my skin looks healthy and tan. I&#x27;ll be using this all year long. It smells good too.</li>
    <li> BEING A REGULAR OUTDOOR/INDOOR TANNER I HAVE USED VERY FEW LOTIONS BECAUSE I NORMALLY TAN GREAT ON MY OWN ..... DECIDED TO TRY THE LOTION AND BOUGHT IT BEING KIND OF DOUBTFUL .... I RECIEVED IT VERY FAST AND DECIDED THE NEXT DAY TO TRY IT .... ONE HR IN THE SUN ON BOTH SIDES IN THE FIRST DAY I HAVE A VERY DEEP TAN .... I WILL DEFINATELY BUY THIS PRODUCT AND I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS AS A FIRST OPTION</li>
    <li> I was nervous about buying lotion over the internet, but after reading the great reviews about it, I decided to try it.  The scent is amazing and the lotion goes on smoothly and without a oily feel.  I will continue to buy this as it was much cheaper than at the salon itself.</li>
    <li> This lotion worked very well and very fast. Gives a dark tan; not orange at all. Also had a really good smell. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great! It gets me really tan plus I use it as a sunless tanner at night at times too because it doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy, and it smells good!</li>
    <li> Got it in the mail today. Went tanning for 11 minutes in the superbed and WOW I am so dark! I am in love with this lotion. I bought it after reading all the great reviews on amazon and everyone was right! My tan looks fantastic and very natural. Get this lotion!!</li>
    <li> The product is priced much lower than the local tanning spa&#x27;s here in St. Louis, but the shipping seems very high.  Enjoy :0)</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about 4 weeks now. With all the positive reviews on this lotion, I was expecting to achieve a higher level of tanning.  Not sure if it just the bottle that I received, but it seems like I have reached a plateau where other have said this product has taken them past the plateau.  Overall the product is great, but I will continue to seek for the product I am looking for. Until then I will enjoy the solid color I get from using this.</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of a tanning product.  I&#x27;m an on-again-off-again tanner and wanted to get a bit more out of my tanning money.  This product seems to work fine.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and, in fact, does a very good job of moisturizing.</li>
    <li> i initially bought this brought at a tanning salon in santa barbara full salon price! i&#x27;ve had it for over two years now, so it was well worth the money considering i would slather the heck out of it on me. provides great color and makes me feel wonderful. i tan easily anyways, but this is a great base tan, and i recommended it to some of my fairer skin friends.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, have bought in past and will continue to use, get dark tan fast, great price too much cheaper than tanning salon.</li>
    <li> very happy with the lotion.  I have tried others and did not like the smell but this one is not objectionable.</li>
    <li> Hey everyone, I just purchased this item about 3 weeks ago because I liked the description, and I needed some new lotion (I thought the bottle looked cool too) I absolutly LOVE this stuff I have used about 20 different, and exspensive lotions since I started tanning and this one is by far the best. The smell is out of this world, theres never a stain on your hands, the color lasts forever. Just a great all around product</li>
    <li> This product works very well. It helps me tan darker and keeps my skin tan days longer.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have taken a winter vacation for the last several years -- Jamaica, Mexico, and now Punta Cana (since we live in Minnesota and long to get away from the cold and snow by Feb.).  We always tan prior to leaving (to get a base tan -- in order to enjoy the tropical environment and not burn).  I have used a number of \\&quot;very\\&quot; expensive tanning lotions sold at our tanning salon.  This is, by far, is the best!  It has a pleasant smell, and better yet, it works -- gives you a \\&quot;real\\&quot; dark tan -- not orange.  This was much less expensive than what I would have paid at the tanning salon.     It is a winner!  We have a nice tan going and are ready for our beach vacation!  :-)</li>
    <li> Loved this stuff. I tan pretty easily so it didn&#x27;t take long to get me brown. Smells amazing, like vanilla sugar. No tingle or burn. I used it on my face and my body and had great results. I decided to use Melt by Designer Skin in the fall and it worked great as well. Anything by Designer Skin I recommend!</li>
    <li> The bronzer in this seemed to wash off faster then other lotions like black night or 20x, I would not buy it again</li>
    <li> This is by far the best indoor tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used.  It works really well.  Not only does it improve the results I get from the tanning bed, it makes my skin really soft.  And as an added bonus, it smells GREAT!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s one of my favorite lotions to use. Unlike some other lotions, this one does not make you red after you are done tanning. It takes a couple of times until you see results. But the nice thing is your not orange when you do begin to see color.</li>
    <li> I am an avid indoor tanner . I have my own commercial tanning bed in my house. I been indoor tanning for 20 years.The tanning salon charges twice as much for this same product. I  picked this one because it costs the same as duel bronzing lotions cost. It works great. I just use it for my face and neck. I am really dark. It took me  6 days straight to get the tan I wanted. It takes now 2-3 sessions a week 15 minutes A session. To keep my tan.Really anything over 4 bronzers in A bottle is A waste. Some things are just as good cheaper. This is one of those things. It took some 10 days for the lotion to get here. I didnt think it was gonna ever get here. But in all fareness . I received free shipping cause I bought two bottles and no tax. I expect quality and and never pay retail.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  Smell is nice and works great!  I was so surprised after I placed my order on Thursday afternoon and it arrived in Saturday&#x27;s mail!  Thank you for quick expedition.  Will buy from you again! Sherry</li>
    <li> What can I say but \\&quot;Awesome,\\&quot; works great. I was stuck and wasn&#x27;t getting much more color until I got this stuff. Designer Skin has the best products out there (besides Devoted). This smells like Bath and Body&#x27;s brown sugar fig lotion (which I love) and it still smells good after you&#x27;ve come out of the cooker. You can go to the mall or out to dinner without having to go home to shower. Time wise GOTTA&#x27; LOVE THAT!!! Buy this stuff you wont be sorry!</li>
    <li> Since only allow myself to have 10 tanning sessions every summer (I fear of all the damage that can be done to my body) I needed a tanning lotion that showed a drastic improvement each tanning session and one with a long lasting color. (I&#x27;m very pale) I read the reviews about this product and decided to give it a try. By the 3rd tanning session I was getting flattering compliments about my amazing color! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with a fair complexion who wants to get a nice quick dark tan.</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion! the bronzers give you tint without being orange.  I could really tell a difference after every tanning visit.  Smells nice too!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it got such fabulous reviews. But I&#x60;m extremely disappointed. I don&#x60;t find the bronzers to be outstanding.I don&#x60;t find it to have a great smell.I don&#x60;t feel it conditions the skin like others I&#x60;ve tried.While I was waiting for this lotion to arrive I used a $10 bottle of lotion from the drugs store and I just didn&#x60;t find that big a difference. Sorry guys. To me this one just doesn&#x60;t measure up....</li>
    <li> Well, I ordered this lotion in hopes of similar results to other reviewers who tan, but was disappointed with the results. I have used a variety of tanning lotions, and like designer skin products generally. This lotion didn&#x27;t seem to improve my tanning results at all versus other lotions I have used, and while the smell wasn&#x27;t unpleasant it was extremely strong and perfumy. As in, I have washed the clothes I wore to the tanning salon at least three times and the smell still remains strong in my clothes. I wonder if perhaps the vendor is messing with the lotion, and the product is not what it should be. While the difference in price is quite large from purchasing in a tan salon, I would be wary of the product you receive and whether it is the &#x27;real deal&#x27; or not.</li>
    <li> Worship me is a popular lotion in every tanning salon ive been to.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a tanning lotion that will bring you instant color, this product is for you! It gives your skin a lovely rosey glow.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have, as with a lot of Bronzing lotions, is the after tan smell. This lotion will leave you quite stinky but its worth it if you again, are seeking instant color. The scent of this lotion is also not the greatest, but definetly not the worst eiether.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that when ever I use this lotion in a high pressure bed, I get really brown!</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used, I saw results the very first night that I used it</li>
    <li> I have been using Swedish Beauty products for 10 years, which I love, and the owner of my tanning salon recommended Designer Skin line of products. I was only going to try quadruple times and up so I thought I would start at Worship Me since it had such great reviews. Ive used the product 3 times and see less results than my cheap 2 or 3 tingle/regular bronzer from Swedish Beauty. Will not buy any more Designer Skin products.</li>
    <li> This product smells pleasant and provides a nice bronzer to compliment tanning. It does not leave a greasy or waxy feel on skin, it is a quality indoor tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> One word for this tanning lotion...awesome!!!  It moisturizes, helps to achieve a beautiful golden tan, and smells wonderful, too.</li>
    <li> Have used product for 5 visits to tanning salon and I look dark on my mid body.  I was told the uv is attracted to the fatty areas of my body so reason for other parts of my body taking longer to tan like my mid section.  Smells good -- like coconuts.</li>
    <li> This lotion is perfect - it definitely accelerates the tanning process and has a pleasant scent.  It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for after seeing the outrageous prices at the tanning salon - I got a great deal and still a quality product!</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical of indoor tanning but since my gym that i goto has an indoor tanning I figured i&#x27;d give it a shot and i just got my worship me tan lotion and my googles and i can&#x27;t wait to use them!...Worship me def. doesn&#x27;t smell girly which is what I was hoping I didn&#x27;t want to walk into the guys lockerroom and smell girly with a tanning lotion so thankfully. I&#x27;ll post how long it takes me to tan when I see improvements. as for shipping..it did come a day earlier than what amazon told me but i guess it took long enough to get here too...damn postal service! But other than that I&#x27;d still order from this company...seems pretty legit and if you&#x27;re person who keeps buying from them you will get free gifts if you mention you&#x27;ve ordered from them before &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have used worship before (in a blue bottle) and loved it. I wanted to try the worship me since I loved worship. So I bought a sample pack to try it and it was amazing! I seen instant results. I was hooked and wanted to buy a bottle of it. But the salon I go to wanted $60.00, so I was very excited when I found it here for this price. It smells good and a little really does go a long way. You&#x27;ll have this bottle of lotion for awhile. It gives you a beautiful brown color and it leaves no streaks. And it don&#x27;t wash off. You will love this lotion. Plus you can use it indoors or out. I can&#x27;t wait to start tanning with it!</li>
