      <li>Smells exactly like CKOne which I still love.</li>
      <li>Clean fresh scent!  </li>
      <li>Smells clean &amp; summery but not floral or cloyingly sweet, which I find a lot of summery scents to do.</li>
      <li>It is never overpowering, always just right!</li>
      <li>My signature fragrance  clean crisp and beautifully light</li>
      <li>luckily i didnt invest in&lt;br /&gt;large bottles.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t what I expected but it was a pleasant surprise.</li>
      <li>The bottle is pretty too, more of a classic style.</li>
      <li>For the price could be longer lasting, so you can enjoy the fragance more.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t smell right when I received it.</li>
      <li>It is very subtle, which is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Overall I still like the light clean fragrance</li>
      <li>Read about it in the Stephanie Plum novels and it smells exactly like I imagined Ranger would smell.</li>
      <li>Only draw back is the short span of wonderful scent.  </li>
      <li>I had saved a scented soap from our honeymoon and was able to finally find it - this</li>
      <li>I love this cologne and I will only buy it here on Amazon</li>
      <li>Enjoying the scent of this cologne,  especially for the price.  </li>
      <li>The bottle is really pretty, which shouldn&#x27;t matter</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know the exact name of the fragrance, but it remained in my memory.</li>
      <li>this was my first.</li>
      <li>It is modern, clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>The only problem with it is that it wears off very quickly.</li>
      <li>My wife really likes it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the shower gel, the cologne, given both of those and soap bars as gifts - always appreciated.</li>
      <li>It is much cheaper on Amazon, which is why I ordered here.  </li>
      <li>Very earthy and soapy smell with flowers.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light scent that will last about 5-6 hours of normal office work before I can&#x27;t smell it on my wrists any longer.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is my favorite scent -- and I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s the normal version or the Extreme.</li>
      <li>I think I like the white tea better but find myself reaching for this more often lately.</li>
      <li>True the scent doesn&#x27;t last all day</li>
      <li>My husband wouldn&#x27;t let me wear it because it makes him feel he is married to an old person.</li>
      <li>More recently I have fallen for Bulgari Red Tea as well.</li>
      <li>#34;it smells like something g am older women</li>
      <li>I believe it blends with your own scent, so the overall effect is subtle and unique to the individual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>The fragrance is a little citrusy... hard to describe but very pleasant.</li>
      <li>Imagine rolling in cut grass and sitting up to catch fresh wind blowing across open flowering fields.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn this scent for years, but I think it&#x27;s more &amp;#34;limey&amp;#34; than like green tea.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll try it a few more times, however I sprayed so.e on a note card and asked a co-workers opinion on it</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fragrance is better over time than immediately.</li>
    <li> Love, love,love,love, did I say love? I love this cologne and I will only buy it here on Amazon, this is my second purchase of the scent. It is so wonderful!</li>
    <li> Been using it for years to coordinate with the shower gel. Love the scent.</li>
    <li> The only perfume I&#x27;ve used for years. Has a light jasmine &amp; orange blossom fragrance. The only problem with it is that it wears off very quickly. If you want something that lasts all day, you&#x27;ll be disappointed. However, unlike other perfumes I&#x27;ve tried, this one smells the same when I use it right after a shower and when I use it later in the day.</li>
    <li> A great, light scent!  It&#x27;s the shower gel that Ranger uses in the Stephanie Plum series, so when I was at an perfume store and saw it, I had to smell it.  It&#x27;s a light scent that will last about 5-6 hours of normal office work before I can&#x27;t smell it on my wrists any longer.  It is much cheaper on Amazon, which is why I ordered here.  My new favorite scent!</li>
    <li> gave it away.........not my taste</li>
    <li> Fake cologne, Minutes, literally 2-3 minutes after i put it on, the scent is GONE! even on the wrist in which i use to rub the cologne onto my neck. No trace of the scent at all. It has a really strong alcohol scent and feel when you put it on. Not the very least a cologne. I collect cologne and this is def a fake! the sticker at the bottom of the bottle looks like it was glue onto.</li>
    <li> This is a scent that has been around for awhile--for the very good reason that it is more like a fresh breath of air than perfume.  It is light and refreshing, and smells great on men AND women.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume thus far...it make me feel happy!</li>
    <li> If you want a scent close to natural, this is one to consider!</li>
    <li> Love this cologne. Read about it in the Stephanie Plum novels and it smells exactly like I imagined Ranger would smell. Hot and sexy. It&#x27;s my new favorite scent. :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell right when I received it.</li>
    <li> I only use this fragrance and it is hard to find in stores and is quite expensive when you can actually find it.&lt;br /&gt;I was not sure if this was original product since the price was SOOOOOOOOOO LOWWWWWW  BUT IT is!&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely happy with the price, the product  and the shipping!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected but it was a pleasant surprise. It&#x27;s masculine then fades into a feminine smell. It great for anyone and everybody. Very earthy and soapy smell with flowers.</li>
    <li> it is so refreshing and clean.  I have been using this for over 10years.  It is my go to perfume.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful , soft and warm. Definitely a feminine scent. This is not an overpowering scent to wear, you won&#x27;t feel as if your perfume is clogging up everyone&#x27;s nose.</li>
    <li> Very fresh.A scent full of joyful and bright.But the only thing that disappointed me was that the longevity and sillage of this perfume was too poor.</li>
    <li> my mom loves this stuff</li>
    <li> I love this scent, it smells clean. But does not last long. For the price could be longer lasting, so you can enjoy the fragance more.</li>
    <li> A lovely, fresh light scent.</li>
    <li> What more to say, bvlgari.  Flagship scent. Been wearing it for years and alway my go to.</li>
    <li> I have the white tea &amp; decided to try this. I love it. I think I like the white tea better but find myself reaching for this more often lately. The bottle is really pretty, which shouldn&#x27;t matter but I do like seeing it on my dressing table next to the white tea bottle. Smells clean &amp; summery but not floral or cloyingly sweet, which I find a lot of summery scents to do.</li>
    <li> Just purchased this Item and haven&#x27;t had a any compliments on it so I&#x27;ll guest I&#x27;ll try it a few more times, however I sprayed so.e on a note card and asked a co-workers opinion on it and she said &amp;#34;it smells like something g am older women would wear&amp;#34; so I&#x27;m curious on how old are the buyers of this item...</li>
    <li> it is a lovely scent, but who cares if it doesn&#x27;t endure the 5 minute&lt;br /&gt;ride to work. i tried it 3 separate days, wearing more each time.&lt;br /&gt;im going to try some other bvulgari fragrances, but now&lt;br /&gt;im nervous about it. this was my first. luckily i didnt invest in&lt;br /&gt;large bottles.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent - crisp and clean and not over-powering.</li>
    <li> I had to buy this years ago when I read about it in the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich. THIS is the scent &amp;#34;Ranger&amp;#34; has in his shower in the gel version that the Stephanie character said she used and loved. The fragrance is VERY fresh and delightful. I get compliments when people stand close to me. I&#x27;ve used the shower gel, the cologne, given both of those and soap bars as gifts - always appreciated. The fragrance is a little citrusy... hard to describe but very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Arrived Timely!  Great Product!!!!</li>
    <li> Confident brand, smell great, light, refreshing.</li>
    <li> This scent is very light and wonderful.  I have used it for years and I really do love it. Good buy.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite fragrances for anytime of year, but especially nice for summer. It is never overpowering, always just right!</li>
    <li> I was leery that this was fake because it was almost half off the normal price, but I decided to trust it since it was sold and shipped by Amazon. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite scent -- and I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s the normal version or the Extreme. Yes, this \\&quot;normal\\&quot; version is very light, but I don&#x27;t think it \\&quot;wears off\\&quot; as some think. I believe it blends with your own scent, so the overall effect is subtle and unique to the individual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When sprayed onto clothing, I can continue to smell it on the fabric, but it is not overpowering. A perfumey scent trail will NOT follow you as you enter a room, but I think that can be appreciated by OTHER people. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a perfume that will cover your overwhelming B.O., then try something else. But if you want a delicate scent, this is worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for cryin&#x27; out loud, DON&#x27;T buy perfume without having smelled it before! An online purchase such as this should be for convenience, not to try something new.</li>
    <li> I have worn the same fragrance for over 40 years and now will be switching to this!  I love the fresh and clean scent with undertones of warm tea, bergamot and vanilla.  Just lovely.  It is modern, clean and soft.  Only draw back is the short span of wonderful scent.  It lasts at best about 4-5 hours.</li>
    <li> Clean fresh scent!  Been getting complements since I started wearing it.  The bottle is pretty too, more of a classic style.</li>
    <li> This is a great scent out of the bottle. No sooner than i put it on after the shower got dressed, drove to work, it had already began to fade. By the end of my 7 hour day. It was gone, gone, gone.</li>
    <li> wonderful products. I would recommend to friends and family. The papaya cream is the best ever and I will continue to order as needed. The cologne is delicate and fresh, not heavy and the sleep mask is so comfortable.</li>
    <li> Enjoying the scent of this cologne,  especially for the price.  True the scent doesn&#x27;t last all day but I also use the body lotion offered.</li>
    <li> Have always liked BVLGARI fragrances, but not this. Everything was great from the seller, but the scent was not what I was expecting&lt;br /&gt;based on the reviews. Will order more of the au the blanc or au the rouge.</li>
    <li> Bulgari was the manufacturer for the toiletries at the resort my husband and I stayed on our honeymoon. I didn&#x27;t know the exact name of the fragrance, but it remained in my memory. I searched malls and online for years, coming close but no cigar. I had saved a scented soap from our honeymoon and was able to finally find it - this fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little heavy when first applied. I recommend spraying into a cotton ball and using that to apply to pulse points (neck, wrists...) But it&#x27;s a scent that lingers nicely, especially in memory.</li>
    <li> Love the scent however I cannot smell it 3 minutes after I put it on.  Expensive to fade so quickly.  Probably would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> My signature fragrance  clean crisp and beautifully light</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for many colognes, but this one smells clean and fresh and light.  It is very subtle, which is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this scent for years, but I think it&#x27;s more &amp;#34;limey&amp;#34; than like green tea.  Marketing I suppose.</li>
    <li> Smells exactly like CKOne which I still love.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent for most occasions.</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t stop sniffing myself!</li>
    <li> This is a lovely fresh scent, not overpowering, I have been using for years</li>
    <li> I am a man like enjoys this light scent. I wish it had a little longer staying power. I think it lasts for about 4 hours. My wife really likes it. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smelled just like I thought wonderful just wish it would last longer</li>
    <li> purchased the shower gel anlong with body lotion, shampoo and conditioner previousy in a travel size collection so i thought i would get the spray cologne also. the spray is a quite a bit stronger than any of the other products. not sure how often i will use the spray so i should have gotten a smaller size, oh well!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful bottle and my girlfriend loved it (was a surprise).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews for all the Bvlgari green tea lotion, soap and fragrance.  all stated the same I experienced, like the product but disappointed would prefer the scent to last longer for the cost of the items.  I did sort of find a way to last longer... I bathed with soap, put lotion on and sprayed fragrance on after bathing.  Before leaving house, sprayed more  fragrance on. Throughout the day I would get a small whiff .  Overall I still like the light clean fragrance</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance.  Lightly scented.  Reminds me of CK.</li>
    <li> I thought it would really be refreshing base from the reviews but this scent smells like an old book with the hint of green tea in between the pages. My husband wouldn&#x27;t let me wear it because it makes him feel he is married to an old person.</li>
    <li> love the scent good value</li>
    <li> Before I found Green Tea by Bulgari I was not familiar with Bulgari scents. I wore it constantly on that trip and cannot help but have flashbacks of those wonderful weeks every time I put it on. For years it was absolutely my most favorite scent. More recently I have fallen for Bulgari Red Tea as well. So I use both. Green Tea is a little stronger and more likely to follow you around a little longer. If you apply the lotion you will surely maintain the delightful alluring &amp;#34;what is that? I cannot imagine what you are wearing?&amp;#34; Green Tea has a leafy, woodsy, clean, maybe a llittle lemony, but not really edible sort of smell. Imagine rolling in cut grass and sitting up to catch fresh wind blowing across open flowering fields. Wow!</li>
