<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best facial cleanser I have come across. It started clearing my acne and spots on my face. The improvement is adorable and I have received a clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to order it again and enjoy the results.</li>
    <li> Our faces always feel much better after using NuNutrients Facial Cleanser.  My wife and I use it almost everyday but you can surely tell if you don&#x27;t use it.  It really cleans the face very well and Rose Hips is high in Vitamin C so I can only believe that it is beneficial.  I really recommend NuNutrients Facial Cleanser for anyone who&#x27;s looking for a good facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> Although I generally prefer facial products without scent, this one isn&#x27;t too bad. And since it doesn&#x27;t stay on my skin, I don&#x27;t mind. I really like how fresh my skin feels when I use this cleanser. It&#x27;s a nice product that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin tight.</li>
    <li> I used to have very bad acne and blackheads when I was older and now I have some adult acne along with some acne scars from previous years. This cleansing gel really makes my face not oily/greasy and I can tell it slowly cleans deeply in my pores because I see less and less blackheads every day. Great formula</li>
    <li> I started using this cleanser two weeks ago and the result is going good so far. I feel refreshing whenever I used it. It is good for removing face dirt and make-up especially after a long day of work. I also like the light scent.&lt;br /&gt;I might considered to get this for one of my friend&#x27;s birthday since she is into skincare stuff.</li>
    <li> Are you ready to give up on all facial cleansers because it either doesn&#x27;t work or it irritates your skin?  Don&#x27;t give up hope just yet.  NuNutrients has a facial cleanser that you may want to give a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dirt and blackheads can be the cause of poor skin and not many cleansers do a good job of removing these problems, NuNutrients Facial Cleanser-Rose Hip Gel may help this problem disappear completely.  Not only will it give a cleaner face, but you will have healthier and clearer skin.  If you are tired of products agitating your skin like me, then you will be happy to give this product a try.</li>
    <li> Seeing that there&#x27;s only one left in stock makes me want to buy it, haha ! I am a huge fan of this facial cleaner. Although it may be priced a bit higher than other facial cleaners, it is well worth it and lasts a long time. When I wash my face in the morning and evenings, I just use a small drop and that is enough to wash my face. It is a gentle cleanser that will wash away even my makeup when I wear it without drying the skin. This cleaner really makes my skin feel like it&#x27;s alive and breathing after I use it. I don&#x27;t know how else to explain it. A big fan of this product. I&#x27;ve even purchased it for others as gifts.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser is wonderful. This is another product my fiancee likes. She uses this to help remove spots off of her face and it amazes me to see how she keeps up with it. She is always smiling as she looks at herself in the mirror because this facial cleanser really do works.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  I L.O.V.E. skin products and I love any product that&#x27;ll make my skin feel good.  The NU Rose Hip Gel does that.  I haven&#x27;t used soap on my skin since I was probably twelve and had always used Noxzema to get my makeup off at night.  The only problem with that was that it never got ALL the makeup off.  That&#x27;s when switched to face cleansers to do the job but many of them, like soap, leave your skin dry to the point where I start getting itchy around the jaw line and my cheeks start to show signs of dry skin.  Not great.  This product is good.  You apply it to your moist face, lather it in and then wash it off.  Pat your skin with a towel and then really LOOK at your face.  Your skin will look alive (I hate to use the word &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34;) - probably because the cleaner&#x27;s gotten rid of the dead skin cells, oil and residue makeup.  More importantly, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry and itchy afterwards.</li>
    <li> Just a dab of NuNutrients Facial Cleanser before bed and in the morning makes my skin feel fresh and clean. This is a great product.  I recommend it.  It is not greasy or oily!  I feel new again!</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness, what a great smelling cleanser! Rose hip is so good for your skin and smells divine. It&#x27;s a light cleanser that doesn&#x27;t make my skin itchy afterwards. Just feels soft and tight. So great!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is worth every penny! I love the way my skin feels after, it really feels like a deep clean. My complexion is noticeably smoother and toned. It takes my stubborn eye make-up right off and it is gentle on my skin. Love the compliments at work, love this cleanser!</li>
    <li> Amazing Facial Cleanser!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels great on Face.Helps to remove dirt,make up and oil.I got to know about this product from my friend .Only little pinch of the cream is sufficient and it works wonder .It is  really great and Very gentle on skin .Love this product</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a cleanser to clean my face without drying or irritation, it removed dirt and my makeup without over drying, this cleanser is for all skin type.&lt;br /&gt;this item is chemical free which is what i look for in a product, i try to only use natural items on my skin only.</li>
    <li> This product was introduced to me by a good friend. She claims it helped her a tremendous amount with clearing her acne and just overall making her skin look healthier and cleaner. I do like the fact that this is a gel, instead of a cream. it absorbs into the skin much quicker and easier this way. I recommend this product to anyone who is seeking to improve the look of their skin</li>
    <li> Wow, what a cleanser! I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of cleansers to avoid acne, and this one is sure the best! I am doing my regular cleansing every morning and my skin is so soft and smooth. Acne haven&#x27;t appeared ever since I started using it. I am a confident and a shiny lady now.</li>
    <li> Recently bought the NuNutrients Facial Cleaner as a gift for my wife. She is absolutely love this stuff. She is a person who has oily skin and after using this her face feels so refreshed and tight. She does makeup at least 5 days a week so cleaning face is very important. This removes all the makeup that one would think is gone with a makeup removing wipe but once using this life changed for the better. Works great for removing makeup and deep cleaning</li>
    <li> I have used other products from the Nu Nutrients line, so I for me their quality is assured. This facial cleanser is no different. No other facial cleanser gives me the stripped bare yet moisturized feeling like Nu Nutrients. I use it before applying make up and to remove make up, in the morning and at night (followed by my Nu Nutrients Renewal Cream of course!) It removes make up completely and cleanses the skin gently and throughly. I have sensitive skin and Nu Nutrients works the best for it. Plus I LOVE the smell!  Its also really compact, great for on the go! I slip it in my purse when I&#x27;m going out overnight.</li>
    <li> NuNutrients Gel cleanser is by far the best thing that I have found to wash my face! I love that it has RoseHip Oil right in it which I have been using seperatly. It makes my face feel clean without the oily or dry feeling. I found this for a promotional price and I glad I did, I will be a repeat customer for sure!</li>
    <li> I have huge skin problems. Its usually so very oily and I break out terribly. I&#x27;m covered with the scars of all the years I&#x27;ve been unable to get my skin cleared up. I&#x27;ve been plagued with problems for almost two decades and I look like I&#x27;m going through puberty every day. Having tried almost everything else out there, I went back to basics and started a regimen of witch hazel twice a day which helped a great deal, but it&#x27;s still not 100% gone. Thus, I&#x27;ve still been trying other things on the market to see if anything does a better job for me. When I heard good things about this from my friends, I decided that it couldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in an attractive bottle, shrink-wrapped so that if it leaked, it wouldn&#x27;t affect anything else packed with it which I appreciated. The branding is extremely attractive with a clean silver and white motif. The presentation is professional and informative. The solution is invigorating and refreshing. It has really done the job, whether it&#x27;s cutting through costume makeup or sweat. It keeps my face clean and has really helped with preventing and clearing up the breakouts. Although I myself cannot smell, my family tells me that it has a very pleasant. I have been very happy with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free in exchange for a genuine critique.</li>
    <li> I have worked in fast food my entire life, and every day when I get home from work, but face is covered in greasy, oily nastiness! I have tried different facial creams and oils, but I have never tried a gel cleanser. This cleanser does not contain any chemicals or harsh ingredients, and it smells amazing. I love rosehip oil and I use it quite frequently in my facial regimen. This cleanser works great, and it takes away all the greasy oily residue off my skin and leaves my face feeling refreshed and pure. Also, it has significantly reduced the amount of acne that I have been having. Will definitely be using this cleanser for a while. I was graciously given a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I adore this product, my mom got this for me after I was recovering from bad sunburn, after the burn was over, I began using this cleanser daily and it has done wonders on my skin and has provided me with a refreshed feeling every morning. I love how it has the added rose hip, it is superb!</li>
    <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been getting some severe breakouts on my face due to stress at work, so I&#x27;d been looking for a skin renewal agent to help clear myself up. I&#x27;ve had these breakouts far longer than a guy my age should, and I was desperate to try something that would clear my face. I&#x27;ve been to dermatologists who all swear by their own prescribed creams, but I always end up back in their office for another batch. I gave this a try, hearing great things about it by coworkers. Sure enough, my face has been clear for weeks after steady applications a couple times throughout the day (usually after waking up and before going to bed). I even let my teenage sister try this as she&#x27;s been having problems controlling her acne - blemish free family! Also I love this because it comes in a gel form, so you can say good-bye to messy creams. Definitely the best in facial cleansers!</li>
    <li> I do not normally use gel cleansers, as they tend to be either too greasy or too drying. This strikes the perfect balance! Rose hip is known for its rejuvenating, soothing effects, and you can definitely feel it when using this facial cleanser. Also has a wonderful, pleasant smell. Face feels clean without feeling stripped of its natural oils. I usually follow this up with NuNtrients Rejuvenating Cream. Definitely a win-win!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s a gel and not something too creamy, as I have oily skin with a few dry spots. It worked great though! My face felt fresh and smooth, and the more I used it, the less I noticed my dark spots and acne scars! I&#x27;ll definitely be getting this again as soon as it&#x27;s available!</li>
    <li> I think it is essential to have very clean skin before applying any cream to your face.  The pores have to be clean and not clogged with dirt before applying cream.  That&#x27;s why I use this Rose Hip Gel cleanser from NuNutrients.  I use it every night and sometimes when I first wake up in the morning.  I love that when I use it, it makes a nice lather and I can feel it working into my pores. After I rinse off with cold water, my skin feels completely clean and refreshed.  I always do this before applying any other products.  I encourage you to do the same for the heath of your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been drinking a lot of soda and eating a lot of pizza and other greasy / fried foods lately. Luckily for me, I found this product in wife&#x27;s skin care arsenal. We&#x27;ve basically been eating the same foods but I noticed that her skin always seems to look fresh, clean, and pimple free. So I decided to give this facial cleanser a whirl. It didn&#x27;t work as fast as I would&#x27;ve liked (Ha! I guess I was expecting nearly instant results!).. But after a few days of using this cleanser my skin started to clear up and look healthier. Would definitely recommend to others in need of a good facial cleansing product.</li>
    <li> Nunutrients Gel Cleanser is one of those types where a little goes a long way...you just need a small dab, so don&#x27;t let the little bottle make you nervous. If foams up beautifully, and cleanses thoroughly. The gel is pink, FYI, and the scent is a touch fruity, but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, and found that it was a bit too much for the dry areas of my face. There was no irritation or anything like that, but it does clean VERY thoroughly, and gets the deep-down dirt. This would be ideal for oily skin...otherwise, use a gentle touch when cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for review purposes. My opinions and clean pores are my own.</li>
    <li> This is very gentle on your skin. It takes my make-up off great at the end of the day.You can not even tell I had any on. I have not had any skin irritation from it at all. You don&#x27;t need very much of this to wash your face. It makes my skin feel very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for a discount for my honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> Edited to add: I&#x27;ve had this bottle for almost 5 months and its still not empty. Granted I only use it 2-3 times a week at most, but it takes the *tiniest* bit to work and I still love it. Very happy to have this!  This is by far my favorite cleanser that I&#x27;ve tried in a long time. I have been slowly making the switch to more natural options in terms of my skincare and my household and this was offered at a promotional rate, so I had to try it. I like it so much more than I expected! I stopped using cleansers on my face about a year ago and my face completely cleared up once I did, so I&#x27;m always hesitant to throw things off. BUT somedays you just need to get that *clean* feeling that only soaps provide. After a busy day outside with the kids (I live in Florida), or a really good workout, or after you&#x27;ve been sick for a couple days and just have that icky feeling. Water alone is a good cleaner for most days, but this has definitely become my &amp;#34;I want to get my face REALLY clean&amp;#34; cleanser. It cleans well without completely stripping my face of everything and doesn&#x27;t leave my face a dry wasteland like &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; cleansers do. It smells good, it lathers just enough but not a crazy amount, and it only takes a teensy tiny bit to work. About half the size of a pea and you are good to do your whole face and neck. An excellent value, especially in regards to exposing yourself to less chemicals and nasty stuff! I received this product at a reduced cost and/or free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial cleanser for people with sensitive skin. I can hardly use anything on my face because it dries and cracks but this facial cleanser left my face feeling soft and hydrated and CLEAN!! Great face wash!</li>
    <li> NuNutrients Facial Cleanser is a great way to eliminate those unwanted black heads.  It&#x27;s also a good way to cleanse after wearing make-up all day.  Priced just under $100, it&#x27;s a bargain.  It&#x27;s a great product to use in the summer time.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this brand through my girlfriend, who uses this and their other products. This is the first gel cleanser that I have used and I was unsure as to whether it would foam or what it would be like to put gel on my face (normally mine comes out in a foam), but this cleaner performed well, had a nice scent, and left my skin feeling clean without making it feel dry. I can&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful facial cleanser. Back in the day I used Sea Breeze on my face. This cleanser is much more effective. You will see improvement to your skin.</li>
    <li> First of all I just want to say I love the smell of this cleanser. It really makes me feel relaxed and fresh after I use it. The next thing I like is how well it cleans my face. I have oily skin that traps dirt and after I used this the dirt was gone and my skin practicaly glowed. I will for sure buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great Product. It really works and I can actually feel the cleanliness after I use it. Nu2 is a great company and I love their products. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and often break out in rashes, hives, and acnefrom the chemicals used in most of the cleansers on the market right now. Nunutrients facial cleanser left my skin feeling soft and refreshed, without the tight skin and left by many other cleansers and the natural ingredients spared my skin from any adverse reaction whatsoever. The fragrance is wonderful; I felt as if I had bathed in a rose garden. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin looking for a gentle cleanser to hydrate as well as clean.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair so when I sleep that oil can get onto my face via my pillow and sometimes I get pimples because of it. Came across this facial cleaner and I use it nightly before bed and after I wake up and my face is in much better shape and I don&#x27;t have adult pimples. Try it out if you have the same issue.</li>
    <li> When it comes to buying a facial cleanser, I am very skeptical since there are so many with harsh ingredients on the market. I am delighted to say that this product is very gentle on my skin and did not cause breakouts. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs to improve the texture of their skin.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by my colleague who makes use of this renewal cream and even other products. This is not the first gel cleanser I used for my facial cleanser issues. This is approximately the sixth one for me. I definitely did not think this gel would be more effective. This is because anything and everything I have used did not bring in good result. But to my surprise this gel performed well and was more effective than the other creams I have ever used. This also gave a good smell , and actually it made my skin to look  clean without letting it go dry. I&#x27;ve been applying this gel daily and started feeling better and doesn&#x27;t seem to be dry like how it was appearing.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using this cleanser, my stubborn acne has disappeared and the best part is that it happened almost overnight! Within a week, my skin had started to clear. I have the kind of acne that seems to cover your whole face and I have tried so many facial cleansers and soaps. Most just dry up my acne but don&#x27;t really deal with the underling issue. Plus those other products end up leaving my face painfully dry. Now that I have started using NuNutrients, I have clear, soft skin that is moisturized and leaves me feeling way more confident. I would recommend this to others like me who are looking for something that will actually work because this product does all that it claims to and more!</li>
    <li> This product does not dry out my skin. I know that might not sound amazing to some people, but I constantly struggle to find products that strike the right balance for my sensitive skin. This cleanser works, but it is not overdrying - absolutely perfect! I love how my skin feels after I use it. I also love the smell, very light and fresh which is something I notice about all NuNutrients products.</li>
