      <li>I love this oil, i put 2 drups in skin care cream at every morning, and i put it on my whole face at every evening.</li>
      <li>I love this oil so much.</li>
      <li>Very Smart Choice!</li>
      <li>Great oil for your hair, face and any other area that needs attention.</li>
      <li>I have used the more popular ones and for me there really is no difference.&lt;br</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m sure there are a few not-so-great ones out there I have been blessed to test out some really good ones.&lt;br /&gt;Recently</li>
      <li>There are so many different uses for Argan oil that there are too many to count and list.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend this product :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Enter Beta Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s fragrance free, which is lovely because I enjoy scented shampoos and conditioners and now I don&#x27;t end up smelling like I dosed myself in a bunch of different perfumes.</li>
      <li>but I love sharing newly discovered brands with my readers.  </li>
      <li>It is absorbed quickly, is lightweight, and leaves my skin moisturized without a sticky feeling.  </li>
      <li>just the first night I used it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;DO NOT use too much!!</li>
      <li>You only need a drop or two at the most!</li>
      <li>Argan Oil is one of my favorite oils, it makes your skin super soft and gives it the nourishment that it needs.  </li>
      <li>With my fingertips, I gently apply 2-3 drops \\&quot;neat\\&quot; and I&#x27;m good to go for the entire day.</li>
      <li>, I love that it&#x27;s organic, natural, and the company doesn&#x27;t do any animal testing.  </li>
      <li>Plus I love that it&#x27;s a natural leave-in conditioner</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few argan oils, including a very popular high end one, and by far this one is my favorite!</li>
      <li>This small 1 oz bottom is great for men who want to keep it discrete at work and for travelling, keep it the car or wherever you want.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I received one bottle of Beta Naturals 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil to review!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easily absorbed and all you are left with is healthy, hydrated and glowy skin.  </li>
      <li>It softens my hair, can be applied every day without making my hair overly oily, and won me over completely by making it easy to comb out tangles</li>
      <li>The packaging is pretty practical to carry around.</li>
      <li>It has so many different uses</li>
      <li>I enjoy using Beta Naturals argan oil on my naturally curly hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very Smart Choice! This product was better than expected and was as described. Arrived on time. Highly recommend! Would buy again and recommend seller. I received this product at a discount for my unbiased and honest feedback.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!! Light, and absorbs quickly.  Too soon to see a big difference, but I believe there has been some improvement in brightness in just a few weeks.</li>
    <li> This very light oil is different from a lot of other Argan oils. It&#x27;s light, organic and  fragrance free - which means there is no irritation and no stickiness or build-up of product on your skin. This product is really for skin and not so much for hair.  If you want to use it for hair, use it sparingly as  part of a mask/deep conditioner treatment.  I like the way it feels on the skin especially now that  it&#x27;s winter.&lt;br /&gt;The results might take a few days providing you use it consistently with a couple of drops at a time. It gives you smooth, hydrated, healthy looking skin that feels nice to the touch.</li>
    <li> Argan Oil is one of my favorite oils, it makes your skin super soft and gives it the nourishment that it needs.  It definitely helps minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  The best thing about this Argan Oil is that it does not clog pores or leave your skin feeling greasy.  Plus I love that it&#x27;s a natural leave-in conditioner, so you get beautiful silky shiny hair.  I would absolutely recommend the Beta Naturals Pure Organic Argan Oil!  I received one bottle of Beta Naturals 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil to review!</li>
    <li> Great oil for your hair, face and any other area that needs attention. This will be a regular purchase for me.</li>
    <li> I have talked about all the reasons I love Argan Oil on my blog, GlamRiver before but I love sharing newly discovered brands with my readers.  The market for Argan Oil has grown quite a bit, even in the last year.  While I&#x27;m sure there are a few not-so-great ones out there I have been blessed to test out some really good ones.&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I have been using this one from Beta Naturals.  It&#x27;s the 100% cold-pressed Pure Organic Moroccan Argan Oil that I have grown to truly love over the last couple of years.  This one by Beta Naturals is a little more affordable than some of the more popular name brand Argan Oils out there.  I have used the more popular ones and for me there really is no difference.&lt;br /&gt;If was going to a deserted island and I could only take one thing it would be Argan Oil!  You can literally use Argan Oil on your entire body, from head to toe.  It makes the perfect facial oil and is suited for all skin types, including oily and blemish prone skin like mine.  It&#x27;s easily absorbed and all you are left with is healthy, hydrated and glowy skin.  It is a &amp;#34;Must Have&amp;#34; product for any skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did receive this product complimentary or at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, I was not paid in anyway and my thoughts and opinions are my own.***</li>
    <li> The online dating scene had never been generous to me because of my acne. I would send hundreds of messages to date-able women, and the closest I had gotten was a reply from a spambot.   A friend introduced to me this Argan oil. I was doubtful about this at first because I&#x27;ve never heard of this plant and what its oil can do to my skin. However I got a 1oz bottle to test it out. Then magic happened.  The results are immediate - on my face and my dating life. Within the first week of use, the replies trickled in... first from PlentyOfFish, then OkCupid. Within the first month I got 3 dates. My acne started to clear up and my confidence rocketed. I even got messages from both females and males on Cougar911.  This product turned my life around (my orientation remained the same). I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> There is so much to say about argan oil that I do not know where to start. I use it for everything when it comes to my body and face to my families. We sometimes refer to it as medicine even though it is not medicine, but when it comes to clearing up spots or healing spots on our bodies it works better than the regular over the counter medicine that we have tried in the past. The 100% pure Argan Oil Moisturizer from the Beta company works wonders for all the things that we have come want Argan oil for. The bottle that I just received is perfect for putting in my purse or bag for the out and about times that you need that extra moisturizing. I know that I love this new smaller bottle. All you have to remember is that it Argan oil does and needs to come in glass bottles so that it keeps the healing properties that it is known for and we pay for. There are so many different uses for Argan oil that there are too many to count and list. For my family it helps with the winter dryness, wind burn, and after shaving. This has become our go to product whenever we have a problem with our skin&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for the purpose of my unbiased review</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I heard about the effectiveness of argan oil as a beauty product. Being a fan of natural skin care, I eventually gave in and tried Beta Naturals Argan Oil. Here&#x27;s a bit of helpful advice if you&#x27;re new to argan oil: you only need to use a little amount, whether it&#x27;s for your skin or hair. Like all argan oil newbies, I applied a little too much the first time. I&#x27;ve since grown to love this argan oil as a skin moisturizer. My skin has adapted well to the argan oil and I doubt I&#x27;ll go back to my former face serum. With my fingertips, I gently apply 2-3 drops \\&quot;neat\\&quot; and I&#x27;m good to go for the entire day. To give my hair a subtle shine, I rub a very small amount between the fingers and apply to the ends - just be careful not to apply too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all natural.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light.&lt;br /&gt;Product absorbs easily.&lt;br /&gt;Very versatile (can be used all over the body and on hair as well).&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;Oil is a great value considering how long a bottle lasts.&lt;br /&gt;It works wonderfully at moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wasn&#x27;t a fan of:&lt;br /&gt;It might take a couple days for your skin to adjust to the argan oil if you&#x27;re using it for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results of Beta Naturals Argan Oil and will purchase from them again.  Great communication and impressive service.  Lovely product.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, i put 2 drups in skin care cream at every morning, and i put it on my whole face at every evening. my face looks very smooth and moisture, i want keep use it.</li>
    <li> Before I tell you about this awesome oil, I want to say a little bit goes a long way!!  You only need a drop or two at the most! No matter what you are using your Argan Oil for, less is more!  It also makes this is an amazing value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting with being a great face moisturizer.  Starting with a clean, dry face; place a couple drops of Argan oil in the palm of your hand and pat the oil all over your face. This is an AWESOME moisturizer, it absorbs fast, without being greasy in the least!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use Pure Argan Oil as your serum if you want, wait a minute or two, then add your moisturizer. Although I have been using my argon oil as my only my moisturizer and I love it!! I love the feel and the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner for your hair. While your hair is wet add a FEW drops of Argan Oil and massage into your hair, through to the ends and scalp. This is a great tip for those that abuse their hair…. ummm like ME!! A drop or two, on dry hair for incredibly shiny hair!!  Without looking greasy. You can also use a single drop on dry hair starting at the ends of your hair and working your way up. This help your dry hair look soft, vibrant and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT use too much!! That’s my most important tip! A small amount goes really far. Too much and you will have a greasy look, or greasy looking hair. No one wants that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be used on your cuticles! Stretch marks and of course my favorite! Fine lines and wrinkles! This oil is truly liquid gold.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin.  Some parts of my face accumulate a lot of oil and shine while other parts (right below my cheeks, for example) start to develop patches of dry, flaky skin.  My skin is also sensitive to chemicals in moisturizers and sunscreens.  I sometimes experience a burning sensation and we all know, that can&#x27;t be good.  The results of these skin issues is a drawer full of skin care products that didn&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to believe that argan oil would live up to its hype.  But I have been pleasantly surprised by it.  It is absorbed quickly, is lightweight, and leaves my skin moisturized without a sticky feeling.  I am really sensitive to oils on my face (if I eat chocolate and get any residue on my face, I am guaranteed to have a pimple the next day!).  I am surprised I haven&#x27;t broken out into pimples yet -- hooray!  I especially appreciate it in these winter months in which our heater is on frequently and the air around me really dries out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the 100% guarantee and responsive customer service.</li>
    <li> I love Argan Oil. I have been using it regularly for awhile now.. It has done wonders as great moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It has so many different uses and i love that. Beta Naturals Argan Oil is the most neutral smelling Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not have the best smell but it works so well. A little goes a long way. A few drops moisturizes my face and leaves my hands feeling hydrated.</li>
    <li> Beta Naturals 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil is odor-less and non greasy, which I love. I enjoy using Beta Naturals argan oil on my naturally curly hair. I’ve found that it has moisturized and improved the manageability of my hair. For use on hair I recommend a putting a few drops into the palm of your hand and massaging onto hair and scalp. If you’re like me and have some split ends Beta Naturals argan oil is also great for sealing your ends. When your hair is in a protective style like braids or twists just add a dab to your finger tip and apply to ends.</li>
    <li> I chose this particular brand of Argan oil after considerable time reading product reviews, on Amazon and elsewhere. I am very satisfied with this oil for my hair, and will reorder this brand. It is in a brown glass bottle with a glass stopper/dropper, which is pleasing. It softens my hair, can be applied every day without making my hair overly oily, and won me over completely by making it easy to comb out tangles ( I have waist length hair). This oil has no odor, and nothing in it except pure oil. It works better than any other single product I have used, and can be combined with other hair products as desired. I am happy!</li>
    <li> By&lt;br /&gt;catbird - See all my reviews&lt;br /&gt;This review is from: Beta Naturals 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil - 1 oz (Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my argan oil directly from the company. The first day I got it I put some of the product on my face where I had some breakout. The bottle slipped out of my fingers and fell to the floor. Some of the glass broke and the oil spilled. I was so disappointed as I had heard so many positive things about argan oil. I e-mailed the company and told them of my experience and suggested putting the product in an unbreakable plastic type of container. I didn&#x27;t expect to hear from them. To my utter amazement I received an e-mail from the company saying how customer satisfaction is a priority with them (it truly is) and that they were sending me a replacement bottle. I e-mailed thanking them for this unexpected kindness and asked if I could put the product in a plastic bottle. I promptly received a response, and found out that it is important to have the product in an amber bottle. They would send me one of these amber colored plastic bottles as well so I wouldn&#x27;t have to search for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was beyond amazed at the caring about their customers that this company shows. Remember the loss of my product was not the fault of this company or their product. I purchase a lot of products from the internet. I am usually satisfied, but often if you contact a company they don&#x27;t even bother to reply. If I am lucky enough to receive a response, it usually leaves me annoyed with that response because it is so uncaring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about dealing with this company. They are beyond wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, after only one application the blemishes I put it on are drying up.&lt;br /&gt;________________________________________</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Beta Naturals for about a month and am loving it. I used to use MoroccanOil, but a friend told me about Beta Naturals and I haven&#x27;t gone back! MoroccanOil smelled really nice, but their oil was thicker and a lot heavier in my hair which is pretty long (about midway down my back). So the thicker oil tended to leave more residue, wear heavier and had an \\&quot;oily\\&quot; look to it if I wasn&#x27;t careful about how I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;Enter Beta Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s fragrance free, which is lovely because I enjoy scented shampoos and conditioners and now I don&#x27;t end up smelling like I dosed myself in a bunch of different perfumes. It&#x27;s much lighter and takes a lot less product because of this. It wears very nicely whether in wet or dry hair and I never have an oily residue or heavy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy to have found Beta Naturals and would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to keep their hair healthy and shiny!</li>
    <li> I used this mostly for chapped lips and stretchmarks... it seemed to make my chapped lips more dry, but it did help my stretchmarks fade. I&#x27;m trying to invest in more soon! It is not a super greasy oil and it has a pretty neutral smell.</li>
    <li> But the glass dropper on the inside broke mid-use.  Not even sure how that happened as I don&#x27;t remember any dropping or hitting or anything like that.  Had to throw the rest of the product away.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an alternative to the Josie Maran argan oil that I was using and have found it to be the same quality at a much better price. I press a few drops into my face after my nightly shower and I also like to use it in my thick hair for a little texture and shine. I wake up with soft smooth skin every morning and I highly recommend this product :)</li>
    <li> It is light weight, non greasy, and versatile. Easily absorbent, leaving a non-greasy finish to the hair and skin. Be patient &amp; you will certainly see results as your skin gradually improves. After a week or two of using this, the skin feels rejuvenated, moisturized, supple, &amp; there are noticeably fewer pimples. It has a kind of smell to it (as expected as this is an organic product), but its not too overpowering. The packaging is pretty practical to carry around. No spills! :)</li>
    <li> My hands and feet get extremely dry during fall and winter time in LA, regular and fancy lotions never seem to take care of the problem. I pretty much have to constantly re-apply every 15 to 30 minutes just to keep from drying up. Lotions never get absorbed under your skin the way you expect, it can get very annoying at times lugging around a bottle of lotion at work. It was virtually a dead end after trying numerous lotions over the years, I even try the baby ones which are intended for my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rescue finally came early this year; a sample bottle of argan oil by Beta Naturals arrived in a gift basket for my daughter&#x27;s first birthday. Naturally, I had no idea how the oil is used other than for hair from what I heard.  Well, argan oil turns out to be an excellent source for baby or toddler skin rejuvenation. It worked like wonders for my daughter and I just had to try it after see the result. What do you know, it works like a charm on me, tool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands literally return to its normal stage in just minutes after first application,  this particular bottle is not scented (some are) and no oily mess or residue as I would expected from oil/petroleum base products. Depending on severity of dryness, the most I have apply in one day was about 3 times since once usually take care of the dryness for hours. I even use it facially as my wife and kids do regularly now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product and was glad to have spotted this on Amazon. I then decided to order a few more for this coming season since my whole family uses it ever since we got the sample.  This small 1 oz bottom is great for men who want to keep it discrete at work and for travelling, keep it the car or wherever you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller&#x27;s service was great, order arrived quickly and literally felt like the next day. The price is very reasonable comparing to other name brands out there. The secret is out, argan oil is for men, too!</li>
    <li> I only use the best products on my face and Beta Naturals 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil is one of them.  Just 1-2 drops in my a.m. cream or sunscreen leaves my skin hydrated and moisturizered without any oily residue.  I use it on my hair which has helped nourish the ends too. I will definitely continue to add Beta Naturals 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil into my skin care routine and as an all around beauty product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love that it&#x27;s organic, natural, and the company doesn&#x27;t do any animal testing.  This is the best Argan Oil on the market and competitively priced well.</li>
    <li> I am very thankful I discovered this brand of argan oil.  I really liked the Marian brand and even gifted it to several friends.  This feels, smells and performs exactly like the more expensive products.  At this price I have added it to all my body butters and moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I have been trying out different brand name and drugstore moisturizers for a long time.  The products I tried tended to leave my face feeling really grimy and greasy.  In the end, my face still felt dry and patchy, and the fine lines continued to multiply.  I just wanted to find something that would leave my face feeling soft, refreshed, and hydrated.  I also needed to find something that did not contain any harmful ingredients, and I didn&#x27;t want to break the bank.  After many unsuccessful and disappointing tries with different moisturizers, I felt like I was asking for too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a bottle of Beta Naturals argan oil, and am I glad that I did!  I immediately saw and felt a difference in the texture and the complexion of my skin.  I didn&#x27;t think it was possible for my skin to dramatically improve so quickly.  No more dry, patchy skin!  I will definitely be a repeat customer.  I am ready to test out the versatility of the product and apply it to my hair and my body.  I guess I found THE \\&quot;magic\\&quot; product, and I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> I use it daily for my face and weekly for my hair - great product!  I see positive results, even in 4 weeks of use.  Last week I recommended to friends to buy it...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few argan oils, including a very popular high end one, and by far this one is my favorite! It&#x27;s light weight, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue, but still moisturizes the skin. I use this on my body and on my sensitive acne prone skin and I&#x27;ve never reacted to it. I get BHA peels regularly and that can leave my skin dry and flaky, but this definitely helps cut back on those side effects.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin. I love this oil so much. When I don&#x27;t know what to put on my face, this is usually the one I go for. It really locks the moisture after the toner.It calms the sensitive area where you can see the redness and tingling are about to develop. It&#x27;s not greasy at all even I use 5 drops for the whole face. But I will buy the 0.5 oz bottle next time, because all oil products tend to get rotten after a while it starts to get contact with air, you would smell that disguising odor when you know it gets rotten. I have to push myself to use the whole bottle before it goes bad.</li>
    <li> I HIGHLY recommend Beta Naturals 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil. I have tried other Argan oils in the past and this by FAR is the best I&#x27;ve tried! It is light weight, so it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy but at the same time is very moisturizing. I noticed results after just the first night I used it! I woke up with soft and glowing skin. During these winter months, my skin gets extremely dry and this Argan oil has brought it back to life after only a week! This is also a multi-use oil, as I am able to use this as a body oil, as a hair treatment and on my cuticles! 100% Pure Organic skincare is the only way to go and I truly appreciate this being a high quality oil. This oil WILL deliver results and is now a staple in my daily skincare routine. I am a fan of their simplistic packaging too! The package arrived safely, nicely packaged and the customer service was phenomenal!</li>
    <li> I love Argan Oil. I have been using it regularly for about 6 months now.  It has done wonders for my fingernails and is a great moisturizer. The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is that it doesn&#x27;t smell great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beta Naturals Argan Oil is the most neutral smelling Argan Oil I have tried.  It is basically odorless. A huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.  A few drops moisturizes my face and leaves my hands feeling hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> This plumped up my skin and also served to condition and sleek down the ends of my hair.  Great stuff and a good value.</li>
    <li> It is ok.  I tried it on my face and felt itchy.  The viscosity is very low and it almost feels like water.</li>
