      <li>The veins are still there but not as prominent as they once were they are more softened.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know how many tubes of this stuff</li>
      <li>It makes you feel like you are getting more, but you aren&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait  to see more results</li>
      <li>and I know I will have to purchase more.</li>
      <li>It has to be diligently applied (on damp skin is best), but when used regularly is has made a huge difference in the spider veins on my thighs.</li>

      <li>I am very satisfied with this product and highly recommend it.</li>

      <li>It seems to be effective in fading relatively new spider veins.  </li>
      <li>Hope to see more positive results</li>
      <li>I was thrilled when I stumbled upon this product on the internet and anxious to try it when I read so many miraculous reviews!  </li>
      <li>and it did absolutely nothing!!</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used it enough yet to know how effective it is.</li>
      <li>Save your money and get the procedure done the right way.</li>
      <li>The tube is very large for the 3.0 oz of product that is inside.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy for those who apparently have had positive results, but personally, I feel I have been scammed.</li>
      <li>The lotion applies easily and has no harsh scent.</li>
      <li>This product does a great job of keeping spider veins on my legs diminished in size - it does not completely eliminate them, but it is far more affordable than laser treatments, and is well worth the money spent.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully they will be totally gone after one more bottle.</li>
      <li>Not 100% sure it is working but convinced enough that I re-ordered it.</li>
      <li>I do have sensitive skin (I use fragrance free everything), but I&#x27;ve never had any issues with this product.</li>
      <li>and I used it consistently for two months.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The formulation is fairly light and a tiny bit greasy, but it soaks right</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really help much at all.  </li>
      <li>but I do not always get to do that but have noticed some real improvement on areas that bother me on my legs.</li>
      <li>hasn&#x27;t really helped yet</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
      <li>I really, really wanted this product to work.</li>
      <li>When I started using the product I didn&#x27;t see much improvement</li>
      <li>I really do like Vita-K</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect this product to do much</li>
      <li>I would suggest to anyone who has mild to moderate spider veins to try this first.</li>
      <li>I mean, if you have a lot of spider veins you might need an alternative treatment (like saline shots), but it is a good choice for people who don&#x27;t want to go that route.</li>
      <li>Worth buying a second one to see if it can make them disappear.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this twice a day for two weeks and most of the dark veins I have had for five years are barely noticeable!</li>
      <li>Am using Lt hoping to prevent new ones.</li>
      <li>Makes face very soft, reduces pores and takes away some of the redness.  </li>
      <li>There was a slight fading but nothing significant.  </li>
      <li>but I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>But legs are soft.</li>
      <li>It is something that you need to keep up on, and if your skin is sensitive you might not want to take it.  </li>
      <li>I saw &amp; purchased this item from a local pharmacy and did not expect much.</li>
      <li>its hydrating,but so far the one tube im using has not diminished anything in terms of spider veins...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>I mean, I wanted to avoid a surgical procedure but let&#x27;s be real, you can&#x27;t replace the real thing with a cream, or no one would get the real surgery.</li>
      <li>Shipping has been a bit slow, so make sure you have enough before you</li>
      <li>After using one tube of Vita-K the bruise spots are almost gone and the veins behind my knees look much better.</li>
      <li>My mother had previously used Vita-K  on her spider veins with success and recommended I give it a try now that I am starting to have spider veins show on my legs.</li>

<li> And if you only have a few, chances are it will help.  </li>
<li> , I know these veins are harder to get rid of.</li>
<li> It worked on my small spider veins, but did not work on the larger ones.  </li>
<li> Somewhat to my surprise, this salve does minimize the dark capillaries around my ankle.  </li>
<li> They claim that you will get results in &amp;#34;as little as 4 weeks.&amp;#34;  This product does not deliver the results it claims to deliver.</li>
<li> Well, it is a waste of money.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> This spring I noticed the veins were back behind my knees</li>
<li> I could tell a difference in my ankles in just a few days.</li>
<li> but I saw no effect at all on the few spider veins I have.</li>
<li> I have one tube left, but I am getting tired of the routine - and the expense.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product works quite well if used twice per day. I can definitely tell that my spider veins are less noticeable. The lotion applies easily and has no harsh scent.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal product! One application and the spider veins either disappeared or were greatly faded. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I really do like Vita-K I could tell a difference in my ankles in just a few days.I started my 2nd tube to try to remove the red spider veins Hope to see more positive results, I know these veins are harder to get rid of.</li>
    <li> So sorry to say, I saw no results at all with the use of this product! I would not recommend to anyone else.</li>
    <li> I have spider veins on my legs. Use this cream already for 3 weeks. Don&#x27;t see any difference yet. May be needed to be used longer.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled when I stumbled upon this product on the internet and anxious to try it when I read so many miraculous reviews!  I&#x27;ve had embarrassing spider veins for many years and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product.  I bought 3 tubes with the understanding that it would take a while to see any results.  I have applied the cream liberally and regularly twice a day (as instructed).  I even bought and used a micro-needle as suggested in one of the reviews.  I have used 2 of the tubes over a 5 week period and haven&#x27;t noticed ANY improvement.  I would have been thrilled with the slightest of fading, but my legs show NO improvement whatsoever!  Not even on the tiniest of spider veins.  I&#x27;m happy for those who apparently have had positive results, but personally, I feel I have been scammed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and have had visible spider veins for quite a while. I have had at least 3 series of the saline injections over a period of about 8 years. They just keep coming back. The injection series have cost between $500 and $750 each time. I didn&#x27;t really expect this product to do much but I have been pleasantly surprised. This spring I noticed the veins were back behind my knees and I had several spots down the inside of my legs that looked like bruises. After using one tube of Vita-K the bruise spots are almost gone and the veins behind my knees look much better. I can buy a lot of tubes of Vita-K for $500. I would suggest to anyone who has mild to moderate spider veins to try this first. I wish I had.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really help much at all.  I used it daily and the difference was neglible.  Maybe I waited too long to try this.</li>
    <li> Not 100% sure it is working but convinced enough that I re-ordered it. Shipping has been a bit slow, so make sure you have enough before you re-order</li>
    <li> Great product when used regularly -excellent transaction.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this product .</li>
    <li> Its a big tube so it took a couple of months to finish it, but I saw no effect at all on the few spider veins I have.</li>
    <li> I use this for a daily cream, it softens my hands and legs like nothing I have ever used</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of vitamin K in it.  According to my pharmacist, if you use Vitamin K it has to be by prescription and your blood levels have to be monitored.  I am on my 3rd tube of this stuff and I can see the difference in my legs.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Not getting rid of veins. Am using Lt hoping to prevent new ones.</li>
    <li> I did not notice a difference in the spider veins on my legs. The texture was good, but did not make a difference.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it enough yet to know how effective it is.</li>
    <li> I am seeing some results. I have only been using about a month now-the tube is almost gone. There is some noticable fading of spider veins, and even some reduction on vericose veins. I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonderful on facial spider veins I have a very fair older complexion I have been using this daily for many years. The veins are still there but not as prominent as they once were they are more softened. I am very happy with this cream.</li>
    <li> Somewhat to my surprise, this salve does minimize the dark capillaries around my ankle.  I have only used it for week or so and the difference is noticeable.</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted this product to work. I gave it a try for two months and noticed absolutely no difference. Having gone through sclerotherapy now, I don&#x27;t even know why I tried this. I mean, I wanted to avoid a surgical procedure but let&#x27;s be real, you can&#x27;t replace the real thing with a cream, or no one would get the real surgery. Save your money and get the procedure done the right way.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product.  It is something that you need to keep up on, and if your skin is sensitive you might not want to take it.  I am using it on spots on my face, and it is helping.  The veins in my legs is another story.  But I think I will keep  using it for a while.</li>
    <li> I saw &amp; purchased this item from a local pharmacy and did not expect much. It says to use twice a day but I do not always get to do that but have noticed some real improvement on areas that bother me on my legs. See it works on age spots as well so will try it on my hands.Glad to see I can order from Amazon as well.</li>
    <li> Just like cellulite creams, you pray that &amp;#34;this time, this one&amp;#34; will work. It takes a doctor to deal with spider veins.  All I bought was hope. And I am intelligent enough to know nothing works that comes in a tube! I deserved to lose the money.</li>
    <li> This product has not made a difference in my spider veins.  Will not buy this product again.  But legs are soft.</li>
    <li> hasn&#x27;t really helped yet</li>
    <li> I have had a history of spider veins for several years.  I have undergone sclerotherapy four times, but the results have never been good.  Even though I know that these kinds of products never work, I was desperate to wear shorts again, so I fell for it.  Well, it is a waste of money.  I applied the lotion twice a day for several weeks.  There is no change in the appearance of veins on my legs.  In addition, the packaging is deceiving.  The tube is very large for the 3.0 oz of product that is inside.  It makes you feel like you are getting more, but you aren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love it. Starting to see some results and I know I will have to purchase more. I can&#x27;t wait  to see more results</li>
    <li> This did not work at all.....if I could give it 0 stars I would</li>
    <li> I have bought many tubes of this and will continue to use it. My spider veins are almost gone. It doesn&#x27;t work over night but yes, it DOES work. I am very satisfied with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My mother had previously used Vita-K  on her spider veins with success and recommended I give it a try now that I am starting to have spider veins show on my legs. I have been using Vita-K for several weeks and have noticed an improvement.  My smaller veins have almost completely faded away but the few bigger, much darker veins have showed little improvement. I plan to continue to use Vita-K.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream off and one for quite a few years. It has to be diligently applied (on damp skin is best), but when used regularly is has made a huge difference in the spider veins on my thighs. The veins will become redder as they heal, but eventually lighten or disappear altogether. It&#x27;s not a perfect solution. I mean, if you have a lot of spider veins you might need an alternative treatment (like saline shots), but it is a good choice for people who don&#x27;t want to go that route. And if you only have a few, chances are it will help.  I have never had any adverse reactions to the cream, as others here seem to have. I do have sensitive skin (I use fragrance free everything), but I&#x27;ve never had any issues with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this twice a day for two weeks and most of the dark veins I have had for five years are barely noticeable! Hopefully they will be totally gone after one more bottle.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference since I&#x27;ve been using it.n</li>
    <li> I got this product for my arms as I have a problem with bruising. It worked to help my skin get stronger and can take a bump now without tearing me, or making big blisters. I take  steroid and it makes my skin thin. This product is awesome, I love it.</li>
    <li> its hydrating,but so far the one tube im using has not diminished anything in terms of spider veins...don&#x27;t know how many tubes of this stuff id have to use?! but the seller was good and so was the price..it does work for dry skin....not sure about what the manufacturer claims in terms of spider vein removal..</li>
    <li> this products is good, made my legs good looking and good feeling. why I have to write more, I don&#x27;t want</li>
    <li> Not particularly impressive. Works fine as a lotion.</li>
    <li> Have used for years- advice- just focus on one small area at a time and dont give up. Works better than the laser treatment.</li>
    <li> Like this product.  It seems to have lightened my spider veins some. Worth buying a second one to see if it can make them disappear.  I would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work, i should have known, to good go be true! Don&#x27;t waste your money. It&#x27;s okay as a lotion.</li>
    <li> It seems to be effective in fading relatively new spider veins.  I see no impact on my ankle where I have had spider veins since my teens, a very long time ago.  I had a couple of small spots pop up a year or so ago.  Application of the cream twice a day for the past two months has resulted is some lessening in appearance.</li>
    <li> I have been rubbing in this Vita-K cream for almost 5 months, and one tube only lasts about 3 weeks!  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the size of my spider veins.  I have one tube left, but I am getting tired of the routine - and the expense.  I expected to have seen some results by now.  I&#x27;m about to give up.  They claim that you will get results in &amp;#34;as little as 4 weeks.&amp;#34;  This product does not deliver the results it claims to deliver.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS.  Works better for rosacea  than prescription meds.  Makes face very soft, reduces pores and takes away some of the redness.  Astringent effect without the dryness.</li>
    <li> This works great on leg bruises. Gone in a day or 2. Probably the same concept as it would use on spider veins, but I haven&#x27;t tried it for those. Strangely it only seems to work on the legs, I had a bruise on my forearm and it didn&#x27;t do much. No idea why.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product not thinking it would work but gave it a try with the reviews I have read from all over. When I started using the product I didn&#x27;t see much improvement but then I thought it needs to penetrate skin better so I used my microneedle before applying the product on the spots I have spider veins and it worked for me. I am hoping with continuos use my spider veins will be done.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion despite the bad reviews I had read on it thinking it was nothing but a bad experience for those customers. Wrong!! I ended up with an entire (unopened) bottle of this stuff because I used two of them and it did absolutely nothing!!</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this works, but it can be used as a lotion.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job of keeping spider veins on my legs diminished in size - it does not completely eliminate them, but it is far more affordable than laser treatments, and is well worth the money spent.  Best product of its type I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> It worked on my small spider veins, but did not work on the larger ones.  I am into my second tube and I am still hoping that some of the spider veins go away.  Looks like I have to go to a doctor for them.</li>
    <li> I noticed a visible change almost immediately. After the first two weeks, I noticed less dramatic results after each use, and I am not certain that this cream will remove spider veins entirely. I was pleased with the results, though; there was significant improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To maximize effectiveness, be sure to massage it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formulation is fairly light and a tiny bit greasy, but it soaks right in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had problems with the lid; it kept popping off entirely instead of flipping open.</li>
    <li> This product did not meet my expectations and I used it consistently for two months.  There was a slight fading but nothing significant.  The product does not work as advertised to fade spider veins.  I used it on my legs and thighs areas and I got very little result and I used as directed for a long time.  All the veins are still noticeable. I will move on and use something more expensive.</li>
