<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this lotion.. I was paying triple from my tanning salon.</li>
    <li> It smells amazing and feels very smooth. I think it works best to get you  a base but not that great at getting you really tan.</li>
    <li> Good stuff smells fantastic</li>
    <li> Good product great smell would recommend.</li>
    <li> Like the moisture this provides</li>
    <li> i always love my juicy</li>
    <li> I have the tanning lotion also. I bought it at the salon where I go tan. Next time will definitely buy it here. The price is much better!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. I love the way it moisturizes and keeps my skin soft and helps my tan stay.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It leaves your skin feeling so soft and the smell is so good! I live at the beach and being exposed to the sun so much I need a good moisturizer. Juicy is wonderful. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Designer skin should sell a perfume that smells exactly like this because it would sell like crazy! I put this lotion on in the morning after I shower, and after tanning once I get home. I have never gotten so many compliments on how I smell before I started using this lotion, now I get multiple compliments a day from my boyfriend, family, friends, and coworkers. Even my manager! And it also makes my skin feel silky and look so hydrated and fresh. I recommend this to everyone and even convinced my mom to buy this lotion for herself as well. If anyone knows of a perfume that smells like the peach scent in this lotion, let me know!</li>
    <li> Nice smell! I did expect lotion, but got tan extender... But it is likely because I was not paying close attention</li>
    <li> This product does not smell like the same lotion from the tanning salon. It gave me a itchy bumpy rash all over my arms and legs. So I won&#x27;t be using it anymore. Bummer.</li>
    <li> Never used post tan moisturizers before but I don&#x27;t have any complaints about this product. Good scent.</li>
    <li> Very nice, light scent.  Leaves my skin extremely soft and the scent is so sheer, I can still wear my favorite perfumes without having the two scents clash.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product too because my daughter ordered it and she really likes it too so I ordered it and am sure to like also.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this lotion because I know it&#x27;s great and smells sooo good. Then I got it and realized it&#x27;s EXPIRED. It&#x27;s printed on the bottom 09/2014.... REALLY ???</li>
    <li> have not tried it yet but it smells great</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion smells awsome feels great on the skin.Shipping was fast and on time what more can you ask for.</li>
    <li> This lotion came in a sealed bag, however, it is expired...and quite frankly doesn&#x27;t smell that great. Pretty disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.  She loves using this after being out in the sun all day.  Keeps her skin moist and even has a peach smell :)</li>
    <li> sweet smell great lotion</li>
    <li> This lotion is great! I used it after sunning at the beach this last year, and my skin felt great! To top it all off the smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> Great mosturizer with a peachy smell. Hydrates all day and helps preserve tan.  Much, much cheaper than what my tanning salon was asking!</li>
    <li> Good scent, shipped on time.  VERY VERY  thin &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; it was so watery!&lt;br /&gt; Did not moisturize.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice and works really well</li>
    <li> Good item for price would order again</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it caused me to break out with these huge red painful pimples that formed deep under the skin(maybe it was a rash?). It took more than a month for them to slowly go away. Even though they&#x27;re healed now, I still have scars a few months later, but they&#x27;re finally starting to fade away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells wonderful. I can&#x27;t comment on how well it extends your tan.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. So silk , smell&lt;br /&gt;So good is not oily and help to stay your tanning</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin so soft and smooth. Very light weight. A little goes a long way and there is quite a bit in the bottle. I use it daily after my shower. Smells incredible. Will definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Very lightweight, perfect for summer but will need something mired moisturizing for winter dry skin. Overall very nice lotion.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice. Makes your skin silky and soft. My boyfriend loves the scent!!</li>
    <li> This is a great value even at full salon price (but never buy tanning lotions at salons theres a huge mark up). I have sensitive skin and one of the reasons I like to tan is because it drys your skin out therefore making it clear and acne free. If you use a greasy lotion and moisturizer then it just clogs your pores and your skin won&#x27;t be clear. I use Luminary or Black by Designer Skin when tanning then after I shower I make sure to put Juicy on. It&#x27;s light and  won&#x27;t make you feel sticky but it will keep you moisturized and has a subtle sweet smell. I thought I could just buy some regular cocoa butter to substitute but its too greasy and thick. You&#x27;ll want to put this on, it really locks in your tan.</li>
    <li> I am so completely obsessed with the smell of this lotion.  I love, love, love it.  It does a really good job and I get fantastic coverage with it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for Christmas for my daughter in law. It was cheaper on line and she loved it! I love getting bargains!</li>
    <li> I was using Hemp until my husband told me he didn&#x27;t like the smell of it, so I bought a bottle of Australian Gold moisturizer because I loved the scent but unfortunately after using the AG my skin turned pale.  I fell in love with the smell of this lotion and broke down and bought a bottle of this from my salon. I wish I would have waited and ordered it through Amazon.  I love the scent of this lotion.  It smells so fresh and isn&#x27;t overpowering.  It soaked right in and leaves my skin feels super smooth, not greasy, heavy or oily.  I can still wear perfume over this lotion and it smells especially great with vanilla scented perfumes.  If you are looking for a step up from the lotions you can buy at Wal-Mart, I definitely recommend you grab a bottle of this because it is really awesome.</li>
    <li> The BEST lotion I have found in 50 years.  It smells pretty, goes on smooth, not greasy at all, soaks in all the way and leaves my skin moist and it actually makes my tan look darker.  No greasy after touch either.  Great for winter and summer.</li>
    <li> Smells and works great. Wish I would have bought it on here instead of paying double the price in the salon.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about buying this product, however I read the reviews and went with my gut feeling. This lotions smells fresh and peachy but when you put it on the scent fades away and doesn&#x27;t smell that great. It still makes my skin really soft. Not oily and its really light. All in all a good product.</li>
    <li> Good product. I thought it was a tanning lotion and it was an extender. My fault though. It smells yummy and is a great extender.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this lotion before. Many times. Both, as a tan extender and every day moisture and it never lets me down. Soft skin. Light fruit and floral scent. It&#x27;s aroma therapy. I highly recommend. Thanks again for another top of the line product!!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Light gel moisturizer.. I prefer a thicker after tan moisturizer. But this is nice and very light</li>
    <li> Smells REALLY good, but it does have ingredients that dry the skin so I didn&#x27;t find that it helped at all with dry skin.  I&#x27;ve been told the key to keeping a tan longer is moisturize, so this works, but it didn&#x27;t aide the dry skin.</li>
    <li> Kept my skin silky soft all day and the smell is terrific. Will definitely purchase more when this runs out!!</li>
    <li> Just a heads up, the date on the bottom is when it was made and it has an 18 month shelf life.</li>
    <li> I really like Juicy ! Smells wonderful &amp; it&#x27;s keeps my Tan to maintain its color !</li>
    <li> Loving this lotion!  Smells great.  Went to the beach for a week three weeks ago and have been using this lotion everyday.  My great salt water tan still looks brand new!</li>
    <li> Smells great but I don&#x27;t think I look more tan using it, opposed to using nothing</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  The lotion smells amazing and helps with the dry skin caused by tanning.  The bottle will last me a while.  Love it!!  Shipping was super fast.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Though it was tanning lotion for the tanning beds but it is for after tanning/showering while you are going to tanning beds.</li>
    <li> This lotion is ok, just didn&#x27;t keep me tan when using it. But a great lotion to keep skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> Smells great and lasted all day!</li>
    <li> This product smell so good mkes you so soft, I think ill be using this all summer long, maybe even winter</li>
    <li> this smells so good! it&#x27;s not greasy at all. i love that it makes my skin feel satin smooth!  .</li>
    <li> Received promptly and loved it</li>
    <li> This lotion is lightweight and smells great! It has no bronzer so it won&#x27;t stain your hands or cause streaks! :)</li>
    <li> This lotion works very well at keeping my skin hydrated after tanning. An after tan lotion is a very important thing to have to keep your tan looking healthy and keep it around for a long time. This lotion also smells absolutely amazing. I catch myself opening it all the time just to smell it. A must have for tanners!</li>
    <li> Smells delicious and makes your skin so soft. The only problem is that it&#x27;s a very thin consistency so you use the bottle up very fast.</li>
    <li> Great smell and skin feels amazing!</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be tanning bed lotion but it is &amp;#34;tan extender&amp;#34; and appears to be a regular, wonderfully scented lotion. So far it has only broken me out (weird mole-like bumps on my hands and fingers) and even my face peeled a little and got incredibly dry after using just once. Kept using it to make sure it was not the tanning bed and it is the lotion. There is a black market for tanning products and other cosmetics, and I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the product has any toxic fillers. In my opinion, I would buy a more expensive product from a trusted retailer and not risk absorbing toxins from potentially dangerous products. I could also just simply be allergic, but it isn&#x27;t worth the risk to me.</li>
    <li> I have tried every tan extending lotion under $20 that I could find on amazon and this is my favorite.  Light smell and it absorbs very well. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> When I got this in the mail I was so excited to use it until I realized that It&#x27;s been expired for over a year.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. I only bought it for lotion. I didn&#x27;t realize it was for tanning. Oh well, It smells great, but it&#x27;s greasy. Don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
    <li> My only complaint here is that it looks like the product is past it&#x27;s expiration date.  The date on the bottom shows 4/2015.  I hope the product will still do it&#x27;s job. I received the product 6/2015.</li>
    <li> Delivered fast. Great for after tanning.</li>
    <li> This I use all the time really like.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it is a nice light moisturizer to use as a tanner.  Price is acceptable and it helps my skin.</li>
    <li> It smells good and is inexpensive. Not much else I can say about it. I like Snooki shimmering moisturizer, also.</li>
    <li> Great product and sellers</li>
    <li> I love everything about this lotion... I only with it was in a pump bottle instead! Love the smell! The consistency is just right for me, not too thick or too thin and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I looked at expiration when I received it and it had expired over a year ago!</li>
    <li> is not tanning lotion just after care. .thought different</li>
    <li> I absolutely Love the smell and the feel of your skin after using this lotion, I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle!!!</li>
    <li> Great item. Has a very good smell. Keeps your skin looking healthy. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Everything about this lotion came up to be above my expectations! Product smell is light and very pleasant; texture is light and absorbable; and this lotion makes my soft enough skin just baby soft!</li>
    <li> Smells soooo good! Perfect for me since I don&#x27;t like using bronzers in my lotions. I use this both before and after I tan to keep my skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love how I walked into the tanning store and they had this same lotion for sale for $75!!! NOT EVEN KIDDING. I guess its top of the line but i absolutely love the smell! And, when I stopped tanning it did help me hold my tan longer! Love it, buying another bottle as soon as mine runs out lol</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE lotion- it absorbs well and feels light and smooth.  I will keep buying this lotion unless the price goes up, or I find something I like better.  For anyone not understanding the date on the bottem, this is the manufacture date- not the expiration date  If you look at your bottle, it has a shelf life of 18 months after the date printed on the bottem.  There are also no tinglers or bronzers in this tan extender lotion like tanning bed lotions often have, so it has a longer shelf life.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and it&#x27;s not greasy and lasts all day long. This product you do not have to re-apply.</li>
    <li> If you like peaches or fruity smells, you will like this!&lt;br /&gt;My tanning salon sells it for 25 dollars so its a good deal on here as well!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Smells great and works well.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s NOT for everyone though, I like it cuz it goes on smooth &amp; easy. I bought this once at a tanning place I used to go to. I can get it so much cheaper on here though.I would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Expired and stinks. Terrible product.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a tanning lotion, didnt realize its an after tanning lotion.. I still love it though. People compliment me at work on how good this smells..</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used to only spray tan and this product kept my skin so moisturized that I was able to keep my spray tan on significantly longer (even during spring break at the beach!). Now that I have started using a tanning bed instead, I still use this product when I get out of the shower because one, I LOVE the way it smells, and two, it makes me feel like I don&#x27;t have to tan as much. Overall, I&#x27;m addicted to this product and would recommend this to anyone (even as a regular lotion).</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. Smells great, keeps you moisturized, and cheaper than bought at a tanning salon! I will be ordering again in the future.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite extender that I have purchased. It smells amazing and leaves my skin feeling amazingly soft for the entire day.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and a nice scent. Keeps my skin from feeling dry. Arrived on time and an excellent price compared to others.</li>
    <li> Repeat purchase. Juicy is the best after tanning lotion available. It&#x27;s thick and creamy so it coats all your dry spots and makes you super soft and silky smooth.</li>
    <li> This product meets all my expectations and does more for my skin than any product I have ever used!  I do have very dry skin, but am not tanned at all.  If it hadn&#x27;t been for my granddaughter I would never have used this product.  It smells heavenly, also!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion!  First off it smells GREAT!  Second it works to moisturize without leaving a greasy feeling.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> This after tanning lotion not only makes your tan last longer, it smells amazing, and it makes your skin incredibly soft. I have extremely dry skin especially when I start tanning, but this lotion is better than most lotions I buys specifically just for dry skin. I completely recommend this 100%</li>
    <li> It smells AMAZING, and works even better. My only complaint is that it is a little goes a REALLY long way, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing. Just watch how much you use during each application. Still 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Fantastic after tanning lotion! Smells fabulous and doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot! A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister in law because she use&#x27;s sun tan oils as a lotion substitute ,,,yes who ever wants to walk around with sun care products on your body that&#x27;s your business. Well I would recommend this for the beach,the bottle is very big and the aroma of peach&#x27;s linger&#x27;s like a cold wind. I just taken a whiff and it&#x27;s so good it reminds me of a &amp;#34;peach-snapps&amp;#34; cocktail. I can not give anymore information regarding this product because it&#x27;s a gift. Though you could research the health benefit&#x27;s if you so desire..</li>
    <li> Smells divine!!! I have used a lot of after care tan lotions but this one is the best yet. Super silky without any residue! Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance and feel!</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful and absorbs into my skin quickly without making me feel oily. love!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion for 17$ in my salon which I thought was a great deal, i used it after tanning and the smell was so strong that I could taste it, It was so bad. it rubbed in nice but it wasnt very thick or extra moisturizing. I just cant get passed that strong terrible horrible smell just awful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update I gave it another try after a shower rather then directly after tanning and it is way more tolerable so I will be able to use up the botlte.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, sealed, and in perfect condition! At first I was a little worried to order this online as I have heard the horror stories about people receiving products that were knockoffs or had been tampered with. But this product is the exact same as what a salon would carry, no dilution or tampering.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way this product smells and how it leaves the skin feeling. It leaves you smelling and feeling very clean and without the oily residue. Your skin will feel extremely soft afterwards and it helps a lot with any dryness or peeling. Also a little goes a long way as it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
    <li> Love this product delivered in time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of using lotion (except for tanning) - I hate how &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; lotion makes my skin feel, takes for ever to absorb, leaves my hands feeling icky and greasy, etc. Since I&#x27;ve been tanning I&#x27;ve realized how important it is to moisturize my skin. Enter Juicy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is a lightweight formula and the scent of white peach is delightful. Its a very light fruity scent. The lotion goes on perfectly - no greasy feeling, and from looking at the lotion it almost looks matte. You get a lot for your money with this one!</li>
    <li> Awesome value. Favorite extender &amp; the cheapest I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s a nice thick, non greasy texture! Loooove.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion, my favorite after tanning, after shower moisturizer!! The scent is outta this world and it leaves your skin feeling so refreshed! Its deliciously hydrating. The price is reasonable and lower than other retailers. I&#x27;ve bought it twice from Amazon and will do so again.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was tanning lotion. It is not. It is after tanning lotion. But it does smell delicious and goes on really nicely.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and would recommend to anyone that wants great looking skin.  It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Smells great and I can still workout after I tan</li>
    <li> Waste of money. I should have listened to the reviews!!!! They should not be allowed to sell expired products!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion, anyone would. It&#x27;s a mild peach smell with quality. It&#x27;s great to put on after a shower. Fast shipping, affordable lotion at a great price. Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> Love the smell and I really think this product worked well I had kept my tan until December which is a lot longer than I normally do! I used it everyday.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best after tan moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried! It smells heavenly :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not expiration date on bottom is a bottle on date&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to your local tanning salon and pick up this and look at the bottom. I guarantee you will see a date that has passed. Just letting everyone know.</li>
    <li> I love the smell! &amp; buying online beats salon prices any day! I use it after day after my shower.</li>
    <li> This was a very cheap moisturizer. I have had better moisturizers shopping at the dollar store. It is very strong smelling and I am unhappy with it so I gave it to my 16 year old.</li>
    <li> Wow what a huge bottle, really great deal and smells great</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!! Definitely does the moisturizing job, And the smell is intoxicatingly addictive. Love love love it!!!</li>
    <li> this lotion is no good. I was not happy at all it did nothing  for tanning at all will never buy again penny</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anybody it smells amazing</li>
    <li> Great got here quick love the product and the price saved me 60$ thanks amazon</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!! It smells amazing!! And soaks in your skin so it isn&#x27;t left feeling oily.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Smells great and is great for extending your tan!</li>
    <li> Love this tan extender lotion! My tanning salon got me hooked and stopped selling it, this lotion makes your skin so soft. Super fast shipping, will buy from again!</li>
    <li> Perfect amount of bronzing in this lotion. Didn&#x27;t smell the peaches that everyone else is talking about- but I think is smells great for tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Smells so good. It actually does make you feel clean if you use it right after you get done tanning. You still may have a slight tacky feeling to the touch, but you yourself don&#x27;t have that yucky sticky sweaty after tanning feeling. I use it after I shower too. Wonderful moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Great smell, not heavy.</li>
    <li> Really loved the product and such a great price!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. It has a great, subtle smell and keeps me moisturized after tanning. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I would definately recommend this product.i like it way more than my regular bath n body works lotion.its thinner and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this fruity lotion it smooths your dry skin and softens your skin perfectly ,it makes my skin look and feel years younger and I recommend it  to anyone that is looking for a great after sun lotion.</li>
    <li> The lotion smells fantastic and goes on so smooth, and makes your skin feel silky. The only thing I am not happy with, is that it expired 04/15. It&#x27;s only a month but still. It would&#x27;ve had 5 stars, but I don&#x27;t like getting something I ordered and have it be expired!!!</li>
    <li> So LOVE this lotion! It is super hydrating and it smells heavenly! It&#x27;s a great after tanning lotion but it&#x27;s also great for every day use.</li>
    <li> This lotion is so soft and creamy.  It&#x27;s perfect for after tanning.  It&#x27;s also less expensive than at the salon.</li>
    <li> Great over all moisterizer and smells great!!!!</li>
    <li> Hard core tanners know this stuff works. Absorbs quicks and smells like peaches (the smell is light and clean, not fruity and overpowering). Lightweight and non greasy, great for after beach or tanning. Use right after shower and it makes your skin feel wonderful. Keeps your color longer and stops that dry, cracked skin feeling. I&#x27;m not sure why the negative reviews as this lotion is hands down the favorite at my tanning salon.  If you purchase this you will not be disappointed. And the price is great so what can you loose!!</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful (fruity and summery) and soaks in quickly. It does not feel like your skin is shellacked in crud. Plus, you really can&#x27;t beat the Amazon price. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love Juicy lotion. it smells awesome and does wonders for the skin! thank you. Will definitely order again</li>
    <li> The lotion was runny and dis nothing to extend the life f my tan.Waste of my hard earned money.It made me sad</li>
    <li> Leaves skin soft with a nice smell. This product has alot Natural ingredients too. Unused it for tanning when I left my other lotion home and it worked good</li>
    <li> I keep seeing posts that people are using this while tanning, believe me THIS IS NOT a tanning lotion, read the back.  It&#x27;s only a tanning extender and not meant to be used in the bed.  I personally use it as lotion and as an extender.  It smells good and feels nice.  Great product like all Designer Skin lotions, tanning and otherwise.  Just don&#x27;t be dumb and use it while tanning, apply after tanning or after a shower and enjoy!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product! works great and smells great too! Will purchase more in the future! awesome!</li>
    <li> The lotion smells absolutely wonderful but it dried my skin out. The price here is good so if your skin doesn&#x27;t tend to be dry and you like peachy fragrances, this will be the lotion for you. I really hate that it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells okay, but it left me sticky. It is also not a very rich lotion, like you would expect an after sun to be.</li>
    <li> good after tanning moisturizer</li>
    <li> I use this after I tan and it smells wonderful and leaves my skin super soft! definitely recommend this lotion!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and when I originally purchased the lotion at my tanning salon it cost me over 30 dollars. Well since I have become an Amazon shopper I look for everything there. Well I found the lotion and it was half of what I paid so I ordered it and it arrived quite quickly and it was great. This is actually the 2nd botle I purchased from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered.Got here on time.Price could have been a little better though.It goes pretty fast,they may need to make it gallon size.</li>
    <li> i love this it smells so good but not to strong like most ive tryed  i will deff be buying more esp with the price on here</li>
    <li> So I accidently bought this thinking it was tanning lotion. However, I absolutely love this lotion, I&#x27;ve used it all summer and it makes my skin super soft. The smell is incredible! Great consistency and not greasy or chalky. Bottle is also adorable. Great everyday summer lotion to keep your skin from drying out with all the swimming and tanning. Will buy again! :)</li>
    <li> My wife worked for tanning salon and could by at cost multiple brands she picked this product and is extremely happy with product. The only way to extend your investment is to moisturizer and this one is great.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping well packed and a great price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful smell and silky smooth feeling! Great product and price, I am on my 2nd bottle and love this tan extender lotion to help keep my glowing tan looking great!!!</li>
    <li> bought this on a whim, so glad I did. love the lotion, smells amazing</li>
    <li> smell realy good like it very much</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need to tan to use this...I really like the way it soaks into my skin.  Everyone is different but for the price....why not try it.  I use lotions that are five times this price and I still like this one!</li>
    <li> It was a very fast delivery and smells awesome but the only bad thing is now I have to order 2 more one for my sister and one for my niece.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer and smells great! I bought it to help cover the tanning smell and it worked.</li>
    <li> Awesome smell smooth application due to the silicone base very moisturizing my go-to for every day moisturizing + extends your tan</li>
    <li> Skin felt nice and silky, and smell nice after tanning.</li>
    <li> Amazing daily moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This lotion is terrible. The smell is overpowering and it does not moisturize like it says it does. What a waste of $$$$. The stuff I bought at Bath and Body works moisturizes better. Save your money and go there!!!</li>
    <li> I like the product, but understood it was tanning lotion.  It is AFTER tanning lotion.  My husband likes the scent, so I use it, but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> It smells amazing! I put it on before my tanning lotion (moist skin absorbs better than dry skin!) Then immediately after tanning. It works very well and keeps my skin softer than ever!</li>
    <li> Love the peach smell!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $!!!</li>
    <li> I worked in a tanning salon for 5 years and I can tell you that this is one of the top products we would carry. The more moisturized your skin is, the better it will hold color. Juicy keeps your skin from drying out and getting all flaky. Plus, it smells fantastic and doesn&#x27;t make you skin feel greasy.</li>
    <li> The smell is nice. The lotion goes on smoothly and there is no sticky feeling after applying. I will be purchasing again when I run out</li>
    <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I have ever had! The smell is to die for. I haven&#x27;t even broken out with this at all. I will buy more!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion after trying other Designer Skin products. I was very pleased with it. It&#x27;s smells great; the smell lasts a long time but it&#x27;s not very thick. I ordered it on a Wednesday and it was at my house on Saturday! Even during a snow storm!</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer as well, I loved it!!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing!!!!! It also works very well. Keeps my skin nice and hydrated!!!! Defiantly worth the money!!!!</li>
    <li> Very milky, and the smell isn&#x27;t my favorite, I couldn&#x27;t tell too much about it. Even through half the bottle.</li>
    <li> If u love Victorias secret pears and want to feel like silk this product is MY favorite. When you hydrate your skin it&#x27;s easier to tan and keep it.  I when use this in Michigan&#x27;s cold winter months after showers.  Silky healthy skin!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product originally just to try out. And now I can&#x27;t stop buying bottles. The bottle lasted me about three to four weeks (applying twice a day). The smell is amazing and never leaves my skin feeling slimy or sticky. As for a tan extender, my tan has never looked more natural. Love love love this product.</li>
    <li> Great product, great light peach floral smell ( and I can&#x27;t stand food scents in products), left my skin silky and soft and extended my tan...and it wasn&#x27;t 75.00 like it is at the tanning salons! Always purchase via Amazon!</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes skin soft love it shipped fast too</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and silky! The price is EXCELLENT considering it&#x27;s almost $40 at my salon!</li>
    <li> Smells great! I don&#x27;t know how much moisturizing it does.</li>
    <li> I was scared that it wouldn&#x27;t actually be juicy gossip inside of the bottle once it arrived, but it was!! I love this stuff, so soft and smells AMAZING!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it l!!!!! It got here real fast and it works and smells great</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best lotion for after tanning. I&#x27;m so glad you guys are sellinging it at such a bargain price.  I will be back to order more.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these at a tanning salon before so I know how the real one, feels, smells, and look like. . .This is the real deal! And I love it! It smells very fruity like peaches! It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and I carry this around everywhere because I re-apply this all the time! I love the way it feels and smell! I will totally buy this again.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD PRICE, A LOT CHEAPER THAN AT THE SALON!</li>
    <li> It took the burn away from my wife gave her hydration</li>
    <li> WOW My wife looks great.</li>
    <li> Workd pretty good just wasnt as pleasef with the smell or thickness.</li>
    <li> The bottle I recieved was from 2011 im hoping thats why it felt sticky and was extra runny. Scent wasnt correct either. Bottom line dont buy.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have been using it for a year.  Goes on smooth and never sticky plus very refreshing fragrance!</li>
    <li> very cheap considering what the tanning salon had it priced at....smells wonderful and very inexpensive....got to me in a very short amount of time</li>
    <li> Probably my fault, but don&#x27;t feel like it was clearly advertised as an &#x27;after sun lotion&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good, but is pretty cheap feeling- I know it&#x27;s not a $40 designer lotion but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth what I paid..&lt;br /&gt;Peach scented, no bronzers, no sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;(I don&#x27;t like sparkles in my lotions!)</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion. I&#x27;m an avid tanner and I tan 5 times a week. I have very dry skin after tanning, which causes me to apply lotion at least twice or three times a day. I use this lotion once after a shower and once after tanning. It immediately removes that ATO and replaces it with a fruity smell that lasts quite a long time. I have never had more compliments on my \\&quot;perfume.\\&quot; Unfortunately, the delivery date had a wide range, and tracking was a problem, but the lotion arrived and was not tampered with. All in all, it&#x27;s a great product, I just wish I would have had a more accurate date on when it would get here.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion thinking that it was for use DURING your tan time, but actually it is for after you tan and after you shower. it is a nice lotion for those times. I was just under a different impression when I bought it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely recommend and love this product. I use it after tanning and instantly feel refreshed and so many people tell me I smell so good. It does seem to extend the tan, keeps me feeling soft, and the best part is the silicone making it cream on with no effort...fast and easy to put on after tanning so you can get dressed and go. Don&#x27;t miss out on this product. I will buy again and again!!!!</li>
    <li> The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because I just thought there would be plastic over the bottle top even if there is a screw on cap but they were so nice and sent me a packet of a diff kind of leg darkener for the price its perfect tho came right on time.</li>
    <li> smells so good! Like a juicy pear, and moisturizes so well. I use it after tanning and after showering to preserve my tan.</li>
    <li> Nice product extends tan</li>
    <li> Love the Lotion but it doesn&#x27;t seem to prolong or keep the tan so I wouldn&#x27;t consider it to be a tan-extender. The lotion itself is great and smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Smells great and makes my skin really soft! If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, I would use it daily instead of just after tanning.</li>
    <li> This is a great everyday moisturizer, tanning or not.  It has a great fresh, peach smell and rubs in smoothly with a clean after feel.  Its a very fresh feeling lotion</li>
    <li> I use this tanning lotion before tanning in a medium pressure bed, and I have noticed softer skin and a more even tan that lasts longer since I&#x27;ve been using it the last few weeks. I tan a few times per week and can maintain my tan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this lotion. It is my new favorite after switching from Believe in Pink tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It keeps my skin moisturized but not greasy. Smells great. Well worth the money !</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  I spray tan all spring and summer and this lotion makes the tan stay on longer and it smells fruity and delicious!</li>
    <li> Received product from bargain tan... it was very fast shipping and was the real product! So that was great however the product itself could be better. It smells good but an hr after you put it on you need to reapply. I have used Swedish beauty girlfriend sexy tan extender so I think that spoiled me. There is no comparison between these two products. If u need a great moisturizer try girlfriend sexy. It really does extend ur tan and moisturize  but if u need a normal go to lotion try this. It does smell good and have good ingredients there just are better products out there.</li>
    <li> Feels and smells great.</li>
    <li> Best after tan lotion&lt;br /&gt;I use it after my showers as well..</li>
    <li> I actually don&#x27;t tan, i bouts this as a daily moisturizer because my skin tends to get very dry, especially on my nose for some reason. I LOVE IT. I just got it today, I&#x27;ve used it once, an i already feel a near incredible difference. My entire face is so silky and not greasy at all. this stuff is magical. The smell is divine. it smells like peach candy. I will definitely buy this from now on.</li>
    <li> Good for after tanning! Nice smell.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Works great</li>
    <li> Skin broke out in a red/pink rash every day I put this on. I didn&#x27;t know it was this product at first, I thought it might have been a food reaction (I&#x27;m not allergic to many things).  Sure enough, after 3 days of using this then stopping, the rash went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shame, too. It smelled wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is a product that has been used for over a year and meets my spouse&#x27;s high expectations. Adding more words to get out of this review.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  It costs about $50 or more at the tanning salon.  It was a much better deal on line.</li>
    <li> Smells good but leaves a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on skin</li>
    <li> I love the way this lotion smells and would have given it a 4 or 5 but it expired last month! I mean its lotion so how bad can it be, just the point that they send you expired lotion and never happen to mention it, but it explains the great price.</li>
    <li> I hate those tanning lotions that somehow have a secretly hidden orange dye in them and you look like an Oompa Loompa walking around and this stuff is heavenly it smells so delicious I dont even put on perfume after using it ... It&#x27;s this peachy fruity scent I even got a compliment an hour after</li>
    <li> Love it so much! This is an insane moisturizer. It smells amazing, it&#x27;s not greasy or overly thick. Dries pretty fast and the moisturizing effects are beyond any other product I have ever tried. Definitely not for men because of the peachy smell but for us ladies, this stuff is a must have, my skin feels like silk. It&#x27;s a big bottle too for the price, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Oh my Jeebus I love this smell!!! I want to bite off my skin if it wouldn&#x27;t hurt so much. Maybs I&#x27;ll just stick to the grocery store fruit aisle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin is soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Like a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;Or a cabbage patch baby doll head.&lt;br /&gt;But the smell is so much more incredible.&lt;br /&gt;Just beware you might get licked or bitten by a passerby who fancies your scent. Unless they&#x27;re zombies, in which case, why the devil are you reading this review?!?! For God&#x27;s sakes, take cover with a decent croquet mallet.</li>
    <li> Love love love it. I love how it smells, and I love how it feels. Amazing product. Awesome price.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells AMAZING!! Very fruity!! It goes on so smoothly and leaves my skin soft. This is a wonderful after tanning lotion!!</li>
    <li> The scent is delicious and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> This is not tanning lotion, which is my fault for not noticing. It&#x27;s basically a moisturizer. It smells great. But that bottle I received expiration date is 8/20/13. I&#x27;ve used lotion past it&#x27;s expiration date plenty of times, but they seller does not state in the description that it&#x27;s dated for last year. I&#x27;m going to keep it because I like the smell and it seems okay. I don&#x27;t feel like going through the trouble of returning it. And I almost forgot, this lotion does not come with a safety seal. It seems like the right lotion is in it, but it could be easily filled up with bogus lotion.</li>
    <li> This was a gift but it was received super fast!!</li>
    <li> Love this..  smells so good. .</li>
    <li> THOUGHT THIS WAS TANNING BED FORMULA...FEEL LIKE A DOPE ...LOL</li>
    <li> It feels a bit watery at first, but with one use, I can tell a huge difference in my skin. My skin looks younger and firmer... Kind of velvety or airbrushed. Not greasy or sticky at all. I use J&amp;J lavender baby lotion and then use this. My skin looks like it did when I was 17 (I&#x27;m 27 and have done a lot of tanning over the past 10 years). I highly recommend it. Smells peachy and light. Great product for my aging, sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price</li>
    <li> Smells great and adds lots of moisture to my sunned dry skin!!!</li>
    <li> This is NOT a tanning lotion!!! It a tanning extender. It smells really good, but it&#x27;s very watery! I don&#x27;t think this is the real deal.</li>
    <li> The smell is AMAZING! I would most definitely recommend this to someone looking for a good moisturizer for tanned or just dry skin, almost instantly after using my skin felt like silk!</li>
    <li> This silicone-based lotion smells fruity and heavenly and moisturizes your skin while it browns very well without being too thick and oily.</li>
    <li> Smells like candy. Doesn&#x27;t taste like candy.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this lotion. It seems to be good for my skin too but I have to apply it twice to feel like it soaks in well enough and the smell only lasts a few hours.</li>
    <li> The smell is great! Doesn&#x27;t give you that after tan smell. It&#x27;s a tan accelerator, doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily.</li>
    <li> Love is product as a first time user of tanning extender for my weekly tanning. In would recommended his to anyone! And I&#x27;m a satisfied customer. 100% what I expected. Fast and on time shipping. Another great buy for me and will but again when I use it all. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I loved using this lotion. It smells great and made my skin super soft. I&#x27;m actially all out the moment and need to order more!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this tanning extender ! Smells very good (sweet peachy smell)</li>
    <li> The smell is alright not bad but not as good as everybody raved about in the comments. The lady at my tanning place said that hers &amp;#34;expired&amp;#34; after about 6 months of not using because of the real fruit juice it it made out of. (she said it smelled like rotting fruit) It make the skin feel great, not oily, and great price, but it wouldn&#x27;t be for the infrequent tanner. If you don&#x27;t plan on using it all in the amount of time your tanning plan is for, you will end of with a kind of pricey daily lotion so you can get it used before it &amp;#34;expires&amp;#34;. But that is all from what my tanning lady said, she could have been trying to get me to buy stuff from her, yet they sell it in store. So buy at your discretion if you are in infrequent tanner (like myself), if you go all the time it is perfectly fine and makes your skin skill soft.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  Whenever I leave the house, people are always telling me I smell so good.  They want to know what perfume I am wearing, no perfume, just this amazing lotion.  You can not beat the price here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so amazing! It&#x27;s insanely moisturizing and makes my tan last longer. Good stuff! Will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I use this after tanning, it smells super-good in combination with my coconut scented bronzing lotion. The consistency of the lotion is light, and is easy to smooth all-over. The scent might be a bit strong for people especially when worn solo, applied directly after tanning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is that great of a tanning lotion, but I like it for regular use and gets compliments on the smell.</li>
    <li> Love love love this lotion smells great and extends the life of my tan.</li>
    <li> So I recieved it quickly. The smell is like a nice tangy citrus fruit!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, but an overall good product.</li>
    <li> No wonder it was so cheap, it expired 4/2015. Very disappointed, especially since it was specifically listed as &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; in product description. If you are selling expired products at discounted rates, let your buyers be aware of what they are purchasing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pretty regular tanner. I usually just use my suave coco butter with shea lotion all over, but decided to try a tanning lotion since a bunch of my friends say they work wonders. I bought this brand based on the price and good reviews. Now I go tanning at least 5 days a week, so I was expecting this lotion to do wonders, especially compared to my normal body lotion. I am very disappointed with my results. While the smell is wonderful, this lotion takes a very long time to sink into my skin. I feel like I&#x27;m rubbing it in for 5 minutes before my skin no longer feels wet. And while other reviews rave about their skin feeling so much softer and more hydrated, about 10-20 minutes after I apply this lotion, I feel as if I need to apply another coat because my skin is so dehydrated. This past week alone I have had scaley patches on my shoulders and legs, which I have NEVER gotten before using this lotion. After getting out of the shower and drying off my legs, flakes upon flakes of skin began to cover my legs because of dry skin, which has also NEVER happened to me since I&#x27;ve been tanning for the last 3 years. I do have dry skin, but I have never had any problems with dry or flakey skin from tanning until I started using this product in place of my regular body lotion. I would NOT recommend this product, especially if you are prone to dry skin. It will not help you in the slightest.</li>
    <li> This DEFINITELY kept my tan around longer this summer!  I love it&#x27;s almost gel-like texture, and the smell is so yummy!</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing, works well and smells great too! :) BUT, I will not be ordering it from here again.. After opening up the package, the bottle was completly damaged.. Dented, lotion coming out everywhere... Not happy!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell as sweet as I thought</li>
    <li> This after tan lotion is amazing. The smell is great and lasts on my skin all day. It&#x27;s nice and light, not a thick lotion that feels heavy. Put it on after everytime I tan.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It feels nice and cool without leaving an oily, messy, or sticky residue! Leaves skin soft and rejuvenated. The seller was prompt and my packaged was delivered before expected, which was a nice surprise! This product does work as an extender, I will be trying the juicy gossip tanning lotion and can&#x27;t wait :D</li>
    <li> I had this in my cart to purchase, $15 is a pretty good price. I found out my tanning salon had a $1.95 sample packet (big enough for about 3 full body applications), so I bought one there to try. Wow. I&#x27;m glad I tried it before buying....I found this lotion underwhelming. I suppose I thought the smell might be a little more perfume-y like Juicy Couture. It&#x27;s just plain peach. It smells JUST LIKE the old Body Drench peach lotion from the 90&#x27;s that the manicurist used to use on my hands :P Not a bad smell, but a bit too little girl-y on a 34 year old woman. The lotion, itself, is okay. It&#x27;s not greasy, which is a plus. It isn&#x27;t very moisturizing, though, as a result. Not as much as, say, my Melaluca Renew lotion. The thinner than expected consistency, coupled with the disappointing scent, led me to delete this item from my cart.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, the only reason i didnt give it a perfect score is the smell, its a REALLY sweet smelling lotion! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it was a tanning lotion, its a tan extender. I still put it on when I went tanning and right after as your supposed to do. The sweet smell over powers the burnt skin smell completely (Id rather smell sweet than gross). It makes your skin feel very soft. Putting it on right after you tan helps not getting burnt, for me at least. Very good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I put this on right after I get out of the tanning bed.  Has a very pleasant smell and is not sticky or greasy feeling.  Seems to moisturize very well, I don&#x27;t have to reapply any lotion within an hour or 2 of using this.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> It smells so wonderful and makes my skin super soft. I even got a few more bottles because I am so afraid of running out of this. My best friend is hooked on it too. We are older in our 50&#x27;s and if it can make our old lady skin look and feel better I can&#x27;t imagine what it will do for younger people.</li>
    <li> I must admit that I bought this product by mistake thinking it was a tanning lotion rather than an &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; tanning lotion, but I am so grateful for my mistake! I have naturally fair skin so anytime I tan I usually start to peel like a snake within a few days no matter if I burn or not. I have used every lotion on the market from the Bath and Body works to Aveeno without being able to keep from tan from peeling until now. I started using this lotion everyday after a shower and my tan has yet to peel- its been two months now! It smells great too for the ladies (maybe too fruity for boys). I definitely recommend this lotion to anyone who has the same problem with their tans peeling/flaking. It works great!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite tanning extending lotions, if not THE favorite. It smells absolutely great, really does extend the life of your tan, and it spreads super easy. I&#x27;ve found a few extenders that are really thick and goupy so you end up using about half the bottle on the first use.</li>
    <li> I am repurchasing this lotion because I am allergic to Hemp lotions and this seems to be the best tan extender without hemp or DHA. Dries quick like the bed lotions but is nice and moisturizing!</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for 2 years now and love the scent and texture.  I am an avid tanner and it works great on my skin....I will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> Smell good and I just love it, please dont raise the price or I will have to try something else</li>
    <li> Want a lotion that keeps skin smooth and hydrated...this is it!! This is one of the best lotions I have used to keep my skin hydrated after tanning. I love this lotion for many reasons; I&#x27;m not allergic to it, smells great, and a little goes a long way. I have bought this product off amazon and spent way too much; now that it&#x27;s offered on Amazon makes it now budget friendly</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing ! It smells so good too .</li>
    <li> My daughter recently turned 13. She&#x27;s at that age where she&#x27;s told me she no longer wants to play sports because &amp;#34;boys don&#x27;t like girls who play sports&amp;#34;. So when she asked for a designer perfume, I bought her this instead. It has a really nice subtle, fresh scent to it and Amazon always has it at a great price. My wife also uses it and sometimes my elderly mom will as well. It&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
    <li> FABULOUS SMELL... great tan extender by Designer Skin. Number one seller at my tanning salon for years.</li>
    <li> Great smelling lotion</li>
    <li> Smells good. And the lotion wasn&#x27;t out of date</li>
    <li> I like the refreshing smell and makes my skin soo soft love it would highly recommend to anyone who tans.</li>
    <li> The best moisturzer I have ever used! I have it on now!</li>
    <li> Product arrived exactly how it was listed and I paid a fraction of what it was being sold for at the salon. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Good extender for tanning...much cheaper than in the salon. Smells so good and is a good lotion for every day use.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and feels like silk. As to the claim of extending a tan, I have yet to find out.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I am new to tanning, but I haven&#x27;t had any drying and believe it or not, this is the first lotion that hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts. I use this everyday after a shower and after tanning. It smells AMAZING, it has a light and not overpowering scent, I pair this with California Tan Expose Step 1 Au Naturel Bronzer and it works very well together. I have a nice bronze tan and soft, sweet smelling skin, win-win :) WAAAAAY Cheaper here than in the salons. I bought it for 3 times the price I found on Amazon, wish I would have bought it here first!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It smells amazing and absorbs quickly so you&#x27;re not left with that slimy lotion feeling. We sell it at my salon, but it&#x27;s cheaper on amazon.</li>
    <li> Very peachy smelling.  Goes on smoothly and skin feels ultra moisturized, without feeling sticky or tacky.  Great price compared to tanning salon!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion and smell!</li>
    <li> I wish the &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; was a little more smooth and silky, but this lotion smells great. It works well to hydrate the skin and extend the tan.</li>
    <li> I love the feel and smell of this lotion.  It has a nice velvety smooth feel and dries fast.  Its a thinner type lotion which I love because I hate having to keep rubbing to get all of the lotion into my skin.  I use it about 3x a day.  I like to use it first thing in the morning and right after i tan and then again after i shower and get ready for bed. It doesnt take long to dry so you can get dressed soon after using. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  I&#x27;ll be buyin more!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It has a great smell, it&#x27;s a light peachy smell.  Very good moisturize for your body.  My legs are usually kinda dry looking, not any more.  They look and feel silky smooth now.  You can almost feel your skin saying thank you......lol. Goes a long way also, I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and I think I can get another 3 weeks out of it.  Well worth the money! I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Just  recieved the lotion..shipping was fast but like another consumer i recieved an expired lotion as well with  the same date ..im guessing  they are trying to get rid of an old stock.</li>
    <li> I love this after tanning lotion! It has a fabulous fruity scent that lingers for a little while and feels really light. It&#x27;s also a great deal on Amazon! It is about three times this price at my local tanning salon.</li>
    <li> Great smell and makes you so soft</li>
    <li> AMAZING!! This lotion is made from juice! Real, peachy juiciness! This lotion will change your life. If Unicorns used lotion, this is what they would insist on! Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion it keeps my skin soft and my tan last longer. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this not realizing its a tan extender but I still love it. It smells great, absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel really soft.</li>
    <li> it is so useful,and when my wife used it she felt that her skin go fresh and lightning. thank you</li>
    <li> I first bought this at my tanning salon for $35, so as you see it is a no brainer to order it here.  First of all, I only tan in the summer months, but use this all year long as it is a wonderful moisturizer in the winter.  The scent is great, I get comments all day long on how good I smell.  The lotion isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky either, so if I sweat during the day I don&#x27;t feel all slimy.  My 6-year-old daughter also likes to use it after her bath!  Great product, I will use this until they stop making it.</li>
    <li> Goes on easily, non-greasy, smells very nice.  Lots of value for the $$.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Thanks! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and feels good!!!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift and I Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderfu l..it is a great product to keep soft and to extend your tan. It smells great also.</li>
    <li> Spending about $27 for a bottle of lotion (including shipping) is pretty sketchy to me. The most expensive make-up I wear is $27.00 and that&#x27;s MAC. I can&#x27;t see spending tons of money on a lotion and now that I got it, I don&#x27;t know if a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; moisturizer even exists. I will have to give it this though, it smells great and these other reviews talking about how its too strong are way outta line in my opinion. It smells great! I am also sun burnt pretty bad so my skin might be REALLY thirsty! I will give it a week and re-do my review so you guys can know how I like it when my skin is normal. :) Can&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> It smells really good, peachy scent....nice.  However its not as thick and rich as I would of liked it to be...  As for making my tan last longer.....  not so much...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know if I would say I feel my tan extends. It smells nice and blends well. Good for the price but there are more moisturizing lotions.</li>
    <li> Smell is mouth watering peachy! Not greasy.  This is my second purchase of this same product!  Great value.  Will by again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of this product. Don&#x27;t know yet how well it works for extending my tan, but as soft as it makes my skin, it should and also should help the tanning process as moisturized skin tans better than dry skin. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Smells great, leaves my skin feeling moisturized and healthy. Can&#x27;t tell how effective it is in prolonging my tanning results, but I like it well enough that I&#x27;d use it as a daily moisturizer regardless of whether I was tanning or not.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It smell great and makes my skin really soft even after washing my hands! I highly recommend this lotion!!!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion because it smells great, and makes your skin feel really soft, But for some reason I feel like I have to apply it a lot as my skin only stays soft and moisturized for a short time with this lotion. I still buy it because of the smell and the initial softness it gives.</li>
    <li> Reviewing, although have no used. The bottle got here super quick and is larger than I thought it would be. Smells great and am exited to use it and see how it goes.</li>
    <li> Love the Scent. My second time purchasing. It doesn&#x27;t give you that orange look ,but rather a nice bronze.</li>
    <li> This product is the best! The Numbers on bottom are not the expiration date. Smells great and lasts all day! Many compliments:)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I got this prduct. I love it. The bottle is good size. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that.  It smells real nice last a long time makes skin soft. . I would recommend this. My daughter loves it too. I may get her a bottle and another for myself. You couldn&#x27;t ask for a better seller too. .</li>
    <li> This product smells really nice. However when I bought it I received an expired one. I don&#x27;t know what that means for the quality of the lotion. But an expiration date is there for a reason.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great, the texture proves that it will definitely moisturize as it should - however, I purchased this thinking that it was tanning lotion -- my mistake! It is AFTER tanning lotion. I will still use this.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It smells so stinkin yummy! And a little bit goes a long way! I use it all the time. It makes my skin silky smooth, also makes your legs look shiny! People are always telling me how good I smell. Great for keeping your tan nice n soft :)</li>
    <li> Smells great!!  Just the moisture your skin needs after the drying affect that tanning can have on it.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothe and smells great.  Personally prefer Angel lotion vs. Juicy.  Bottle is little difficult to get the lotion out of once you have applied a layer.  Bulky and slips out of hands easily.  Overall rating is good.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this, but when it arrived i saw it was expired. Please contact be to resolve. I would like to reorder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a handful of after tan moisturizers and this is by far my favorite. It absorbs SO quickly and smells amazing. Even if I didn&#x27;t tan, I would still continue to use this as I do notice my skin loves it. the price is great for the quality, and I&#x27;d gladly pay double for it.</li>
    <li> The frangrance is nice and it really moisturizes your skin throughout the day. I use it as a daily moisturizer and after tanning skin care lotion.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic!! Love that it&#x27;s not super oily, it rubs in nicely</li>
    <li> This is the way to go if you want to avoid the high cost of after tanning lotion in the salon. Works very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll let you in on a little secret: the BEST body lotions are marketed to indoor tanners! So if you somehow stumbled on this product but don&#x27;t tan- don&#x27;t let yourself get scared off. this lotion smells freaking incredible... exactly like a ripe peach, but its not overwhelming or plasticy smelling. it&#x27;s pretty moisturizing too, although i don&#x27;t have problems with dry skin. the only thing i would change is the packaging. it is packaged in a squirt bottle like most tanning lotion, but i prefer a pump.</li>
    <li> works great. smells kind of fruity</li>
    <li> Leaves a good smell. Not sure if it keeps the tan any longer but it definitely leaves your skin silky smooth</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  It smells great and is a great moisturizer for my skin.  A litle goes a long way!</li>
    <li> It makes your skin feel really soft and silky and the smell is really sweet and fruity like.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it Smells Great. Leaves skin soft get multiple compliments of smell. Bottle has lasted over two months and not even half way gone.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the product and the timeliness in which I received it. I love this brand and the smell</li>
    <li> very very good!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> This smells so good, like fresh peaches.  It&#x27;s not moisturizing enough for after the shower (I&#x27;m very dry), but with another lotion it&#x27;s great,  I do love it after tanning though, it is perfect and does help to extend the tan!</li>
    <li> Expired, smelled funky, I should have returned it, I sure wont be using it!  Why is this allowed?</li>
    <li> While looking at other reviews prior to my purchase, I noticed someone write that they believed they had received a fake bottle. But since so many others raved about it, I chose to ignore this review. I wish I had not. When I received my bottle, not only was the lid not sealed, the plastic wrap/label around the outside was completely skewed and appeared as if it had been applied by a non-manufacturer. There was absolutely nothing special about the product, and did not extend my tan at all. I could not smell any scent to the lotion, and the only thing it did was moisturize -- like any $2 lotion you could find at a grocery store. BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of juicy it smells like sweethearts and you can&#x27;t beat the price compared to what they are in tanning salons.</li>
    <li> Its really good I love it and the designer lotion are really good it really helps keep a good tan</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion and the price is the cheapest that I have found anywhere and I will be getting all my lotions from there.</li>
    <li> I love Juicy!!!  My friend and I bought this lotion and are very happy with it.  It has a nice citrus grapefruit smell to it.  It leaves your skin very silky.  We bought more for gifts!!!</li>
    <li> Nice lotion for summer. Not thick and deep enough moisture for winter. Wonderful smell. Will use again when it gets warmer.</li>
    <li> I have just started tanning and I can already say I&#x27;m in love! It leave my skin feeling smooth and soft, so happy I bought this!</li>
    <li> This tan extender lotion smells great and keeps your skin soft long after you have finished tanning indoors our outside.  I recommend using this along with Juicy Desire pre-tan lotion.</li>
    <li> I think I like this stuff for the smell more than anything. I get a lot of compliments when I wear this lotion.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the smell of this stuff. That is the main reason I got it in the first place. Got it on time. Great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used almost every lotion out there but nothing comes close to this.. The smell is fabulous and you feel like silk all day!! I will defiantly buy more!</li>
    <li> Great product.  This tanning extender really does work!  It keeps the color fresh for at least 2-3 days after tanning.  This lotion also has a nice fragrance, goes on smooth like a lotion-gel hybrid, and absorbs quickly so that it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great peachy smell, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything my OTC lotion from Walgreens doesn&#x27;t already do.  It&#x27;s a nice lotion but you don&#x27;t need it if you already have a good one.</li>
    <li> I must have missed something when I bought this because I thought I was getting tanning lotion. It wasn&#x27;t until after I used it that I realized that it was &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; tan lotion. I was only tanning to prepare for a vacation, so it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal to me, but if you&#x27;re looking for those special ingredients to help you &amp;#34;maximize&amp;#34; your tan and all, then I&#x27;d pass on this product. It doesn&#x27;t smell that great, but it feels nice.</li>
    <li> I got this product yesterday and had come home from the tanning bed and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.  I was impressed!  Smells wonderful, absorbs quickly.  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because the bottle design is not the greatest.  I have small hands and it&#x27;s big., bulky, and heavy holding with one hand.  Felt like you really had to hang onto it.  The product however is great.  Smells like a spicy peachy pear.  Not overwhelming either.  Would definitely recommend as an after tanning/bathing moisturizer.  Only used it once so far so can&#x27;t say how it does for extending the life of your tan.</li>
    <li> I like using this when my skin does not need a thick moisturizer for dryness.  This is thin, lightweight, and quick-to-absorb, which is great in the summertime.  Would not recommend if you have very dry skin and are looking for a thick, healing lotion.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! unless you cant stand peaches but i love it! its very moisturizing and goes on easily! I would definitely recommend this tan extender!</li>
    <li> Smells divine and is so moisturizing! The smell reminds me of starburst candy. My husband really likes when I use this lotion. Highly recommend after a day in the sun.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering a lotion that you put on before you tan but I didnt read the description well enough. when I got the package and opened it up I was suprised to see a clear liquid coming out of the bottle. After further reading into this product it is actually used for after tanning to reinforce a tan and hyrdrate the skin. IT SMELLS AMAZING. So overall I am not disappointed with the fact that it isnt what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Perfect just like the one at the salon&lt;br /&gt;Only a lot. Cheaper love it</li>
    <li> While the scent is amazing like fresh peaches, I&#x27;m not sure it really moisturizes. It is non-sticky and does absorb fast. Skin stay smelling great all day!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Just like juicy apples!</li>
    <li> Love the scent, it is very creamy and moisturizing. Leaves your skin feeling fully moisturized as well smelling good.  For my dry skin, I only need to use this lotions once a day and I stay moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the scent it smells so sweet and gives your skin that natural glow you want without the sticky residue of most lotions. Leaves your skin incredibly smooth</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel so good. No greasy or oily feel and it smells really good too.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this lotion. It smells delicious and I love the how moisturized my skin feels after applying it on.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, smells amazing almost tropical or like pineapple coconut</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion, originally purchased over the summer while trying to maintain my tan. Love it so much I use now as a daily moisturizer. The scent stays and I get compliments all the time on my perfume, which is really the lotion working.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this! Also works great when putting on right after the tanning bed. Helps keep your skin moisturized</li>
    <li> When smelling this lotion its almost like squeezing fresh fruit! It kinda smells like starburst candy! Love it for its scent and it also leaves my skin silky smooth. My skin is noticeably softer and more healthy. I definitely recommend this. It is a fine product from Designer Skin. But I was just looking and I just noticed that on my new bottle from this seller it says \\&quot;Tan Extender\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;Moisturizer.\\&quot; I&#x27;m really wondering why mine is different than the actual Designer Skin bottle. Could this be a fake from this seller? Something to think about when buying.</li>
    <li> I kind of like the smell, and I kind of like how it moisturizes-- but it could be a whole lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would go with AG products over DS any day at this point in my trial process, though.</li>
    <li> The lotion is nice. I like it. The smell is almost like pears.&lt;br /&gt;It came fast, and is a good lotion.</li>
    <li> I got this for my best friend for Christmas along with tanning lotion and she absolutely loves it! Great purchase and great price!</li>
    <li> makes my skin soft but very peachy smell......almost a little too strong for me. however it does work so that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about Juicy! I use it immediately after tanning and showering and it leaves my skin baby soft! And the SMELL! Omg it smells like heaven in a bottle- the white peach fragrance is so nice and I get compliments all the time on it!</li>
    <li> Loveeee the smell. Its a really fresh peach fruit smell. I was going to tan and didn&#x27;t get to it before summer but I use this as a regular lotion now and I love ittttt! Deff would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a secondary tanning lotion so my skin doesn&#x27;t get plateaued when using my other lotion. (Jwoww one and done) love it. Great choice and amazing price.</li>
    <li> This has been the very best skin moisturizer that I have ever used.  Not only do I use indoor tanning, I also spend alot of time outdoors. So my skin is exposed to alot of damaging rays, but this product makes my 55 year old skin feel like its back into my 20&#x27;s!!</li>
    <li> bought this at work and it is amazing! I never get that nasty greasy feeling, sinks into my skin instantly, makes my skin glow like I&#x27;ve been using lotion since i was born. AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING. and it smells yummy too!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion it&#x27;s light, smells fruity, and makes my skin soft &amp; bronzed!</li>
    <li> Not really a tanning lotion but it great for moisturizing. Smells awesome too!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this tan extended... but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different wither I use this or a regular body lotion.  But I have also not used it right after exiting that tanning bed</li>
    <li> not a big fan of the smell</li>
    <li> lotion makes your skin feel so smooth and smells great</li>
    <li> i love this product. i use it after tanning. its soft, smells great, and isnt greasy or thick. its not like a lotion or thick cream. its light on the skin. its a great moisterizer. highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion in the summer because it&#x27;s so thin. It&#x27;s not heavy like most lotions. It&#x27;s a fruity smell but not so strong that it suffocates or sticks around forever. It won&#x27;t ever replace the Sinfully Soft that I cannot find ANYWHERE, but it&#x27;s a good lotion.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and tans great with out the unwanted &amp;#34;orange look&amp;#34; that bronzers give you!</li>
    <li> awesome stuff I have ordered it twice!</li>
    <li> Said it was a tanning lotion. It&#x27;s not. It is an extender for after tanning.</li>
    <li> Smells SO clean and fresh, feels amazing on the skin too!! super fast shipping, great customer service, fantastic product, super low prices...I could literally go on about it!! I will continue to purchase from this seller as well as recommend to others!! Kudos on all levels!!(:</li>
    <li> Works great, can&#x27;t tell if it actually extends my tan but it is a great lotion with a sweet smell.</li>
    <li> It spreads easily so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot. It smells so good too! I don&#x27;t use it everyday because it is more expensive than a regular body lotion, but it is worth buying to use the days you to tanning.</li>
    <li> I love the way this stuff smells.  It also helps replenish some moisture into my skin after I tan.  When I opened the package, I was concerned about the dates and codes printed on the bottle.  I contacted the seller, who researched the numbers and explained them to me.  So, everything is in date!  The product smells delicious!  And it works well.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I loved it it was super cheap ordered it at night it was here the next day. It was def worth the money.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells like heaven, so yummy and the bottle is huge. Nothing to envy to any VS or Bath &amp; Body Works lotion. It is not sticky and leave your skin so soft and mosturized. I believe you get a lot of a good product for a great price. I will keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> A lot of great lotion for a great price! I love the way it smells and how easy it goes on!</li>
    <li> shipped fast. Smells great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion. Smells wonderful and is very moisterising.</li>
    <li> Love how it leaves my skin feeling!!! Smells great!!! Love it would buy it again today! Was here on time!</li>
    <li> First off this is a AFTER tanning lotion. and I absolutely love it, it works fantastic and the scent is amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a way to make there skin feel &amp; look like it hasn&#x27;t been in a tanning bed!</li>
    <li> This lotion from Green Web is exactly the same stuff sold at the salon. It smells amazing. Not one complaint.</li>
    <li> Great after sun product. Smells great!!!</li>
    <li> this is just a tannning extender so u use it for mostiure and to retain ur tan you dont use it to go in tanning bed smeelles greattt !!  if you like juicy gossip you will love this one more , very good price i had to grab two more !!</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle of this at the salon and I love it! Its light feeling which is great with summer coming. I dont like to use heavy lotions that make me feel sticky when its so hot out. It smells great, very refreshing. I like to use it after I tan to minimize the &amp;#34;tan smell&amp;#34;. I do use this daily after I shower. The previous tan extender I used was Kisses by Austrailian Gold and I think that did a better job at holding my tan than this. But the smell and feel of this one is wayyyy better.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the lotion!! It makes my skin soft and smell good for the whole day... not cheap or junk lotion by far.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing properties and smells great. I like to use after tanning and after my shower, my skin is never dry when I use this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SMELLS GREAT AND TAN LAST LONGER. IVE USED IT FOR A YEAR NOW.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Really hydrates the skin.</li>
    <li> Nice thick and very moisturizing lotion smells like peaches and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth, perfect for after tanning.</li>
    <li> I love this product! The smell is to die for and it really does help you keep your color. I love the price, especially since it is 1/2 the price of the SAME thing at the tanning salon! I will never buy tanning products from a salon again!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome! Skin feels so smooth! Not sure if it &amp;#34;extends&amp;#34; my tan any better than keeping my skin well moisturized but it does smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing makes skin super soft and really helps extend your tan!!</li>
    <li> Item came sooner than expected..., and its a great moisturizer for tanning and for every day use! Smells great too! Makes u think of being at the beach! :)</li>
    <li> Designer skin DOES NOT sell their products online. They carry their products solely in certified salons. Sure you can chance buying this product because maybe some salon is selling it as a clearance item but sometimes these bottles are used and then replaced with part real lotion and part some other generic lotion. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the super low prices online. PROTECT yourself and buy from your local salon.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention purchasing from your local salon will help keep it in business since you&#x27;re working so hard and paying so much money to achieve your dark tan.&lt;br /&gt;You wont be able to keep tanning if your salon goes out of business because everyone is buying lotion online when it isn&#x27;t even the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;Also non-certified tanning lotions damage the acrylics on tanning beds; causing them to fog up and you won&#x27;t be getting as dark plus ruining everyone else&#x27;s tanning experience plus costing the salon&#x27;s more money to replace the acrylic. This goes for all tanning lotions sold online not just the moisturizers. You&#x27;re just harming yourself using this stuff. If you&#x27;re too cheap to put in a few extra dollars for the real deal you&#x27;re better off using crappy lotion from the drug store, better for your skin than buying \\&quot;salon\\&quot; lotions online.</li>
    <li> It came a week before expected! At my tanning place it was 70 ! This is an awesome price and smells so good!! Haven&#x27;t used it yet but I&#x27;m excited to and will edit my review with an update!  Update: still love this lotion  my skin use to get so dry after tanning it would flake off! But after just a few days of using this lotion my skin looks and feels amazing! It helps out so much as for the smell it&#x27;s great when you first put it on but after like an hour it wears off. Smells like peaches I think</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT and my husband loves the smell :)</li>
    <li> smells yummy an smoothes on nicely its not greasey---an comes out of the bottle easy an ya don&#x27;t need much</li>
    <li> Smell is great but my skin is still itchy and dry after I use this, it is not very thick.</li>
    <li> Smells so good. But wish it was thicker like angel. Beautiful bottle good price. Would recommend for smell not necessarily 12hr moisture.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and leaves my skin silky and glowing. I use it daily as a moisurizer, and twice a day on tanning days...I will be a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Smells amazing but not over powering!  Amd really works well.  I love that it moisturizes without feeling greasy or sticky</li>
    <li> This is a very good moisturizer. Keeps skin very soft and does help extend your tan! I would recommend this over any other product and I have tried many after previously working in a tanning salon.</li>
    <li> This is honestly the best moisturizer/tan extender I&#x27;ve ever used.  It goes on super smooth and makes your skin feel nice and silky (like all Designer Skin products should).  Smells and feels jut like Juicy Gossip (the tanning lotion).  It smells amazing and keeps your skin hydrated all day; I will definitely be using this and only this from now on.</li>
    <li> Lotion was expired! Said 2014, Hello it&#x27;s 2015.</li>
    <li> Love it, use it and give it as gifts which are appreciated by the receivers</li>
    <li> I originally got this stuff as a gift and now I buy it on amazon whenever I need more. The bottle is huge and lasts forever, plus the moisturizer itself smells amazing. It&#x27;s also really thin which I like because it provides a lot of moisture and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky afterwards.</li>
    <li> i really don&#x27;t like the smell but i like the lotion. my daughter uses it everytime we tan. it makes your skin feel soft after tanning.</li>
    <li> It works fine but came expired based on the date on the bottom...</li>
    <li> Smells great, love the lotion</li>
    <li> I have tried other after tanning lotions and have found this is my favorite by far!!  Love the scent and the lasting effects!  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I liked this lotion it feels light on your skin leaves your skin smooth and hydrated. You don&#x27;t need a lot because it spreads easily and has a nice peach scent.</li>
    <li> smells so good!!!! makes my skin soft.  Love love love</li>
    <li> this is a great lotion..... I also use a small amount as a leave in hair conditioner and it makes my curly hair so soft.</li>
    <li> This product is super expensive at the tanning salon. Very afforable here even with the shipping cost. It leaves you smelling amazing. It doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy like other lotions. It isn&#x27;t super hydrating either though. I buy it because it&#x27;s cheap, smells good, and makes my skin look great right after tanning. I wouldn&#x27;t say I notice a huge change in extending my tan.</li>
    <li> I was excited ti try this lotion and honestly was not impressed. The lotion does smell good, at first. But the scent almost smells like peach dehodrant After u sweat..lol and the lotion is not creamy at all.. More of a watery like lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! The scent is so fresh and not over powering. I have really sensitive skin and this has not caused me any problems And I use it daily morning &amp; night. The ingredients are beneficial and I feel it is making a difference in preserving my color and overall moisture balance. Go for it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I loved this lotion!  This lotion is so moisturizing and has the best smell, and what a price!  I&#x27;ll continue getting my Juicy from here, as this was the best price and fastest service!</li>
    <li> Luv the scent. Keeps me hydrated. Absorbs easily. Recommend to all ages. Small amount goes a long way.  Easy to apply</li>
    <li> I purchased this tan extender with my luminary tanning lotion after smelling it in my salon. So first let me say this lotion was 100% authentic! the smell is amazing so fresh,clean,light,peachy,juicy goodness. the scent does stay with you for a long time but is not in any way over powering! it hydrates my dry skin so well and makes it so soft. it absorbs great, not greasy not too thick but not to thin its perfect. it makes my skin look better after awhile also where I could actualy notice so that&#x27;s good. it does extend my tan very well. I went tanning for a month and stopped for a few weeks so I could get a deal on tanning that they were having for certain days and I didn&#x27;t lose any color what so ever using this. its amazing you will not regret buying. im afraid ill run out but priced way lower than my salon so price wont be an issue but am still keeping more than one bottle at all times even when not tanning because I absolutely love this lotion so much.</li>
