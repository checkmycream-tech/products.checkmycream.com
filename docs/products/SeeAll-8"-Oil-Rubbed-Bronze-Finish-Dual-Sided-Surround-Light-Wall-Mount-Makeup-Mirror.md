      <li>Easy to install, looks as advertised and my wife loves it and that folks is all that matters.</li>
      <li>Easy to install.  </li>
      <li>It is such a beautiful addition to our bathroom.   </li>
      <li>I still recommend buying it as it functions well and and provide ample light if your main bathroom lights are bright.</li>
      <li>It mounted easily and works great as an option for a standard mirror in the bathroom.  </li>
      <li>I think that in order to get a brighter light it would need to be LED.  </li>
      <li>Worked well for a month, then the light switch did not work at all.  </li>
      <li>However, the light could stand to be brighter.</li>
      <li>As far as the product itself, I won&#x27;t know how good the mirror is till I travel 8 hours to my daughter-in-laws and give it to her.</li>
      <li>It requires more light in the room to be useful</li>
      <li>Delivery was fast and the make up light is a perfect match for the other oil rubbed bronze fixtures we have installed in the remodeling project.</li>
      <li>Overall, good.</li>
      <li>The brightness of the light is just right.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, works well and looks great.  </li>
      <li>i love the finish on it as it is high quality.  </li>
      <li>I would probably have given the mirror four stars if our bathroom wasn&#x27;t so well-lit because it would be hard to use otherwise, but luckily we have very bright lights in our bathroom</li>
      <li>I would recommend installing it where there is already some good light because its light is not very bright.  </li>
      <li>The light is good enough to add a little additional but is not sufficient on its own.</li>
      <li>(I suppose if the light were putting off any light, there may be a heat issue with the light pressed up against a wall and left in the on position).</li>
      <li>I love the mirror with one minor exception, the light needs to be a tad bit brighter.  </li>
      <li>My perfect vision is starting to fade a little and with  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice change from those tacky chrome plated mirrors, that only really have a place in the bathroom.  </li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t matter that the light is pretty dim.</li>
      <li>The Mirror was delivered in the amount of time promised and it is actually exactly as promised.  </li>
      <li>When we first got this, the on/off switch didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>It is very handy and now it is hard to get ready without it when I&#x27;m not at home!</li>
      <li>hasn&#x27;t complained, so it seems to be a pretty good product for her makeup stuff....</li>
      <li>I will keep it and just be satisfied with a light that is not very bright.</li>
      <li>A little shorter than I hoped it would be and magnification not as much as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>The only drawback was that the light was a bit wimpy.  </li>
      <li>My wife really likes it.  </li>
      <li>Very flexible in how it is positioned.  </li>
      <li>So much for \\&quot;progress\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Having the light is an extra plus.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
      <li>We mounted this next to my vanity in the bedroom and it looks fabulous.  </li>
      <li>The magnification is very helpful when applying  makeup.    </li>
      <li>The brown tones have a perfect &amp;#34;antique&amp;#34; look instead of that cheap, fake brown paint you often see as an alternative to black.  </li>
      <li>We had to wait a few weeks to get a new switch which was super easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Oh well, less wrinkles to see :-)</li>
      <li>I find myself longing for my older chrome collapsable non lighted mirror.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for your particular needs.</li>
      <li>The mirror looks nice, but the light is not bright enough.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The mirror itself is beautiful, and high quality however, the light is not bright enough! The light is so weak, it is about the same as holding a night light up to your face to see makeup application. After installation, we found the solid fold out bar was not nearly as handy as the old, non wired type it replaced. The mirror is also designed to not touch the wall when folded up (I suppose if the light were putting off any light, there may be a heat issue with the light pressed up against a wall and left in the on position). Add to this fact that because it is illuminated it is about 2\\&quot; thick and you will find the mirror sticks out from the wall about 3\\&quot;. I find myself longing for my older chrome collapsable non lighted mirror. It was far easier to retract, and stuck out from the wall a mere 1/2\\&quot;. So much for \\&quot;progress\\&quot;. Oh well, on the good side.....I can&#x27;t see my wrinkles any longer!</li>
    <li> Shipped and received promptly. A little shorter than I hoped it would be and magnification not as much as I would have liked. Overall, good.</li>
    <li> This mirror was a really easy instal.  My wife really likes it.  The curled cord is a really nice touch and keeps it out of the way.</li>
    <li> When I received this mirror it was mostly as I expected.  The bronze finish was perfect and the magnification on the mirror was great.  The only drawback was that the light was a bit wimpy.  I think that in order to get a brighter light it would need to be LED.  I will keep it and just be satisfied with a light that is not very bright.</li>
    <li> I love the look of the mirror, but the lighting is not bright enough. Oh well, less wrinkles to see :-)</li>
    <li> My wife had been wanting one for a long time, but had a hard time finding one that mounted to the wall, had a plug in cord, and had an oil rubbed bronze finish. This one met all my requirements and seems to be well made.</li>
    <li> it looked pretty, but had to send back as it was to large for  my wall... waiting on refund.</li>
    <li> this mirror was hard to find, but worth the wait.  i love the finish on it as it is high quality.  The light is not very bright, but I kind of knew that going in from other reviews.  very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> My bathroom doesn&#x27;t have very good lighting and I bought this mirror hoping to finally be able to see those pesky chin hairs that are a part of aging.  It is a beautiful mirror and the finish was very nice.  Easy to install. Very flexible in how it is positioned.  Unfortunately the light is just not very bright.  I can see just as well holding up a hand mirror beside this mirror.</li>
    <li> I wanted a mirror that I could use to put my eye makeup on in the mornings.  I&#x27;ve seen this type of mirror at hotels and decided that I wanted one at home.  We chose the rubbed bronze to go with the rustic decor of our house.  It is very handy and now it is hard to get ready without it when I&#x27;m not at home!</li>
    <li> Delivery was late, otherwise I would give it 5 stars.  The color, magnifcation, size expectations are what was advertised... no suprises.  The face plate that attaches to the wall could be tighter... with the arm out, it appears \\&quot;loose,\\&quot; but it is as tight as can be.  So far, though, everything works great!</li>
    <li> When we first got this, the on/off switch didn&#x27;t work.  We had to wait a few weeks to get a new switch which was super easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wife hasn&#x27;t complained, so it seems to be a pretty good product for her makeup stuff....</li>
    <li> Easy to install, looks as advertised and my wife loves it and that folks is all that matters. Has a replacement bulb which is nice.</li>
    <li> good unit.  good finish.  even had a replacement bulb.  can see myself too close now.  would buy from mfg again.</li>
    <li> The product delivered was just like the one presented online. Good price and excelent delivery.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  I bought it for my bathroom, of course, and it really helps with plucking and such.  My perfect vision is starting to fade a little and with  this mirror I can put on my makeup and know that it okay. This product is very heavy duty so you need bolt it to the wall but mine has stayed in place.  I love this.</li>
    <li> Worked well for a month, then the light switch did not work at all.  Now I need to plug, unplug manually.</li>
    <li> The mirror was a Christmas present for my daughter-in-law, who spent Christmas with me, with a delivery date before 12/25/13.  It did not get sent to me till two weeks after Christmas.  I received nothing in return for my frustration and added expense of getting it to my daughter-in-law who lives out of state. I am very disappointed on how Amazon handle this error on their part.  As far as the product itself, I won&#x27;t know how good the mirror is till I travel 8 hours to my daughter-in-laws and give it to her.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product. A perfect shaving mirror for my husband. Having the light is an extra plus. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with my magnifying mirror.  It was a little difficult to hook up because I thought it was a direct wire mirror.  We had to install a plug inside the cabinet and drill a small hole through the side to plug it  in.  It was a little extra work for the Electrician, but that was my fault.  It works great.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast and the make up light is a perfect match for the other oil rubbed bronze fixtures we have installed in the remodeling project.</li>
    <li> The mirror looks nice, but the light is not bright enough.  It requires more light in the room to be useful</li>
    <li> The unit is great - however the units switch was broken, the plastic cap that attaches to the switch stem was broken, when turning the switch the cap would spin without turning the unit on. Very frustrating after hardwiring into the wall then the outlet - only to be tripped up with the simple stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I did end up adding tape to the inside of the cap to add some thickness to hold the cap to the stem.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly -looks great on the wall.  Easy to install.  We have now purchased two of these mirrors for two bathrooms in our house.</li>
    <li> It is such a beautiful addition to our bathroom.   The magnification is very helpful when applying  makeup.    The piece is both elegant and sturdy.  We are  very happy with this purchase....</li>
    <li> I love it!  The brightness of the light is just right.  The oil rubbed bronze is perfect in our bathroom.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this handy mirror with light.  It mounted easily and works great as an option for a standard mirror in the bathroom.  It&#x27;s nice to have the focused light and magnification for my \\&quot;getting older\\&quot; eyes.</li>

    <li> The mirror is attractive looking, good quality and convenient.  It is also very easy to install.  I would recommend installing it where there is already some good light because its light is not very bright.  The light is good enough to add a little additional but is not sufficient on its own.</li>
    <li> We choose this for finish and flexibility.  Was able to remove cord, plug hole in base and mount to junction box on wall.</li>
    <li> It was easy to install and looks great in our new bathroom.  The only complaint is that we wish the light was brighter</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Loved it. Sturdy, matches exactly with my decor and good price. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 years already and it still looks new.</li>
    <li> This is my second one.  Works great!  Looks Great! Good value for the money! Highly recommend!  easy to Install and use!</li>
    <li> The unit does not turn off and on .</li>
    <li> My sister loves this mirror and it goes well with her décor. She can finally see well enough to put her face on in the morning. AAA+++</li>
    <li> looks great in my new rustic bathroom</li>
    <li> Wonderful light, purchased this for my husband after staying at a fancy hotel where they had one. It is so attractive and of good quality. Has worked without issue for quite a long time. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time finding a wall mounted oil rubbed bronze lighted makeup mirror. My wife uses it every day.  I bought this 1-1/2 years ago and it is holding up great.</li>
    <li> The Oil Rubbed Bronze Finish fits perfectly in our bath.  The Mirror was delivered in the amount of time promised and it is actually exactly as promised.  We hung it on the wall and I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> I love the look of this mirror and the fact that it is much better priced than comparable mirrors that you find at stores. However, the light could stand to be brighter.

The brown tones have a perfect &amp;#34;antique&amp;#34; look instead of that cheap, fake brown paint you often see as an alternative to black.  The only thing I would change is that there&#x27;s no vertical mobility.  You have to mount it at a perfect height or you&#x27;ll have to adjust your seat.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my wife.  It pleased her.  Seems you are making it hard to rate a product.  Wonder why..</li>
    <li> I love the mirror with one minor exception, the light needs to be a tad bit brighter.  Other than that, works well and looks great.  I still recommend buying it as it functions well and and provide ample light if your main bathroom lights are bright.</li>
    <li> This is what I ordered and what I expected.  I was concerned that it did not show it shipped in the time I thought it should but itade it in perfect time.</li>
