      <li>Thanks to Dana, it is available again, I am thrilled</li>
      <li>Still happy to have it back!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve thought of it often and didn&#x27;t think it was even available anymore</li>
      <li>It is light and airy.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>evrything was perfect right down to shipping and being timely.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and was excited about the reduced price</li>
      <li>I wanted a gift for a neighbor who is special.</li>
      <li>I like it because it doesn&#x27;t smell sweet like food or flowers, but spicy, &amp; not over powering.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had try to find another perfume that I love as much as this product.</li>
      <li>Always loved French.</li>
      <li>Love it as much as  </li>
      <li>Nice, powdery smell and not overpowering like most other perfumes.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to be able to get it at much less than I have had to pay at the kiosk at the mall for it - when they had it..   </li>
      <li>I would most certainly encourage everyone who wants this product to buy it here.</li>
      <li>This is unusual in that it could work for an office or a night out and is suitable for any age - a young girl or a grandma .</li>
      <li>This is an old, overly strong fragrance my mother used to wear in the 1950&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Priced very reasonably.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t clash with my body chemistry, I&#x27;ve worn it for 25 years and still love it.</li>
      <li>I still love the scent and every time I spray it on it brings back memories!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find Toujours Moi for quite some time locally.  </li>
      <li>Great sillage and long lasting.  </li>
      <li>I received my first bottle of Toujours Moi when I was a teenager, and it has been my signature fragrance ever since.  </li>
      <li>I received everything exactly as promised.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Oriental&amp;#34; is a very popular perfume family but orientals with woodsy undertones are hard to find.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I finely found it on line and for a fraction of the cost I once spent for one half an ounce before.</li>
      <li>This has been one of my favorite fragrances for a long time.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a huge bottle - and possibly lighter than I remember it.  </li>
      <li>very feminine ..</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t sea floral scents because they really make me feel it</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t one of those perfume scents that evaporates the second you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the bottle is comfortable to the hand and the spray saves money on spills.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for over 40 years its awesome. It was a gift to me in the ninth grade</li>
    <li> One of my wife&#x27;s favorites.  Nice.</li>
    <li> Great product and great service.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this beautiful cologne for over 40 years.  It is the ONLY fragrance I will wear, and I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I&#x27;ve had over the years from complete strangers.  It has truly become my \\&quot;signature scent.\\&quot;    When I ran out recently, and could not find it in any of the stores where I have previously purchased it, I decided to order online from Amazon.    When I spray this on it smells nothing like the Toujour Moi I&#x27;ve been using all of these years. In addition, the scent lingers for approximately 5 minutes and then NOTHING, no scent at all.  The wonderful scent of the &#x27;real&#x27; Toujour Moi lasts on my skin from morning until night when I go to bed.    I know Dana did not change the formula, because since receiving the bottle from Amazon, I&#x27;ve purchased an additional bottle from another online company and that bottle smells and lasts just like the cologne I&#x27;ve been wearing all of these years.     I&#x27;m very disappointed in this purchase from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Sandalwood and Vetiver?????? Not what the Dana website says. They mention neither ingredient.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and was excited about the reduced price so I ordered 2 bottles. No wonder the price was reduced because the product must have been old.  It stinks! I would definitely not recommend ordering to anyone.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find Toujours Moi for quite some time locally.  I still love the cologne and was please to find it here.  It&#x27;s a huge bottle - and possibly lighter than I remember it.  That&#x27;s likely just a different variety (perfume, cologne, etc.).</li>
    <li> Arrived within time frame.  It is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume and the price was great,.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  When I receive this it&#x27;s not the same as I have purchased at a local store.  Not sure what the problem is but I hate the smell:(</li>
    <li> This is the only fragrance my Mother-in-law will wear.  It is getting harder and harder to find it. I was thrilled to be able to get it at much less than I have had to pay at the kiosk at the mall for it - when they had it..   I was able to order it and have it arrive within the week to my house.  I have a very happy  Mother-in-law now!!  Who could ask for more!!!</li>
    <li> Loved this. Received several compliments when wearing</li>
    <li> Favorite cologne very hard to find; I have wearing this cologne for years and very happy that I can purchase here at a great price</li>
    <li> My daughter never forgot how good my hair smelled when I bent over to kiss her good night and I wanted to see if it still would smell same but not quite the same.  Too bad as I believe it means  &amp;#34;Forever Me&amp;#34; in French. Always loved French. Missed my unicorns and I did not get to carry the scent throughout the day and not like when my friend Karen and I used to exchange bottles on Xmas.</li>
    <li> My friends call this my &#x27;signature scent&#x27; and I even had a guy stop me in my tracks &amp; ask me what it was as he HAD to spray it on his pillow, he LOVED it...  I get lots of compliments on it, soft, subtle, lovely scent.  It&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t clash with my body chemistry, I&#x27;ve worn it for 25 years and still love it.</li>
    <li> This is a perfume I have worn for years and always got complements on its fragrance.  The bottle I received smelled totally different, almost rancid!  Maybe the formula was changed, I hope not. Maybe it was just a bad batch.</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite.</li>
    <li> Best purchase ever. So pleased.</li>
    <li> She loves it.She has been using this for a long time and was hard to find in our immediate area.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because my mom used to wear it, and I wanted a little reminder of her.&lt;br /&gt;My mom NEVER stunk like this.  Blech.</li>
    <li> a gift for myself I love</li>
    <li> I have worn Toujour Moi perfume for a very long time.  Unfortunately, I think that this bottle sat on a shelf for a long time somewhere as it has an entirely different smell.  I&#x27;ve always gotten good comments from others on how nice it smells on me but not this time!  I think it&#x27;s old and I&#x27;m not happy with it.  I would not order it again through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love the item.    Have used it for years, but unable to find it in local stores.</li>
    <li> Yay! I was so happy to see that this perfume is still being sold. I used to use it as my signature scent in college and had forgotten about it. It brought back great memories as soon as I spritzed on this wonderful cologne.</li>
    <li> This was just what my mother wanted for her birthday.  It was shipped quickly and was less expensive than any place I shopped and my wife and I did look around.  I could not be happier .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for 40 years and am always getting compliments!</li>
    <li> I have always loved this scent, even as a child smelling it on my mother.</li>
    <li> This is just horrible, cheap smelling - not the same fragrance as before, which I have used for at least 35 years.  So disappointed - this now smells like a bad knock-off of the old Intimate cologne.</li>
    <li> this perfume does not smell the same as my other bottle. And the label looks as if it was slapped on after.</li>
    <li> My purchase was the exact thing I ordered very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> It was a pleasure to do business with Amazon and get this item that I just love! I would most certainly encourage everyone who wants this product to buy it here.</li>
    <li> Love it as much as  i did 45 yearrs ago.. as soon as i put some on it took me back to a wonderful (teeenage) time in my life. evrything was perfect right down to shipping and being timely. thank youi</li>
    <li> i have been looking for this for a while.  this perfume smells so good its mild and not over bearing.  my husband loves this perfume.</li>
    <li> Just want I wanted, as described ...  Very happy with purchase. A+</li>
    <li> My mother used to buy this back in the late 80&#x27;s and I would complement how good she smelled all the time. Decided to try it recently after all those years and it still smell so good.</li>
    <li> I have a dear friend who loves this perfume. Haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores for the past few years. Was happy to find it on Amazon and bought two bottles for a birthday gift. Smells wonderful! She was thrilled to have her favorite perfume again.</li>
    <li> I spritz this on to remind me of my mom&#x27;s signature scent.  Then I feel empowered for the day.  I get lots of compliments on it, too.</li>
    <li> This cologne is my favorite!!  It arrived very quickly, in great condition!!  It is such a value, a large bottle at a  very reasonable price!  I plan on ordering from this vendor again.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been using this fragrance since the mid 70&#x27;s and nothing can compare to it and I have tried several.  This one you forget you put it on and at 5 in the afternoon someone compliments you on it. NOTHING lasts like that!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this for years with out any luck. I&#x27;m so happy I finely found it on line and for a fraction of the cost I once spent for one half an ounce before.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this stuff. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is an old, overly strong fragrance my mother used to wear in the 1950&#x27;s. She asked for it for Christmas this year. It is as awful as I remember.</li>
    <li> Have used this cologne and the actual purfume too for years and so many ladies have asked me to write down the name for them I just can&#x27;t count them all. Stays with you and doesn&#x27;t over power you.Love this cologne...</li>
    <li> It has become hard to find Toujours Moi Perfume and it is my wife favorite.  I got a great product at the advertised price and with in the time frame that was specified.  I am happy with my order and would order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I have used Toujours Moi for many years. It has a fragrance that reminds me of Spring. It is light and airy.&lt;br /&gt;This perfume has been around a long time and there is a reason for that. It smells wonderful and stays gently with you all day. It isn&#x27;t one of those perfume scents that evaporates the second you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the bottle is comfortable to the hand and the spray saves money on spills.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it soon. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This is a soft but spicy feminine fragrance that is  GORGEOUS ! It has been around since the 1920&#x27;s , but believe me it is a LOVELY classic - as perfect as a perfume can get and outrageously cheap. If this was put in a \\&quot;designer \\&quot; bottle  with a different label it could fetch a BIG price . It is that good and lasts well through the day . I believe it is sandalwood and vetiver and amber . It is not overbearing , but is sweet and spicy and warm. You will not go wrong with it and everyone will want to know what you are wearing . This is a jewel of a fragrance find even if it is a very old one . This is unusual in that it could work for an office or a night out and is suitable for any age - a young girl or a grandma . LOVELY CLASSIC !!!</li>
    <li> I wanted a gift for a neighbor who is special. This is her favorite and I was thrilled to find it at the right price.</li>
    <li> The service was great, fast and good product.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I received my first bottle of Toujours Moi when I was a teenager, and it has been my signature fragrance ever since.  It&#x27;s so hard to find in stores, so I&#x27;m grateful for Amazon and the dealers who midst there.</li>
    <li> Only place I found it after local stores stopped selling it and it is one I have worn for decades. Love it!</li>
    <li> Had this cologne years ago.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the stores in our area.  Was so happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> I first used this perfume way back in the 80&#x27;s. I loved it then, &amp; still do. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t smell sweet like food or flowers, but spicy, &amp; not over powering.</li>
    <li> I am very familiar with Toujours Moi as I have been wearing it for over forty years.  It is perfect for me and everyone seems to identify me by the fragrance...  Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had try to find another perfume that I love as much as this product. Nice, powdery smell and not overpowering like most other perfumes. I can&#x27;t sea floral scents because they really make me feel it but this ones does not.</li>
    <li> This has been one of my favorite fragrances for a long time.  Whenever I wear it, I usualy get compliments about how good I smell.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  Priced very reasonably.</li>
    <li> I received everything exactly as promised. great experience</li>
    <li> I wore this for years, seems to have been changed somehow, has a more musky smell that before.  Won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> were moved and I did not know where to get this and I was saved again by Amazone...100% what I expected and price was great.</li>
    <li> My mother gave me this cologne when I was a teen and I get so many compliments when I wear it.  I try to wear it frequently.</li>
    <li> My Aunt bought this fragrance for me when I was in high school 30 years ago.  I&#x27;ve thought of it often and didn&#x27;t think it was even available anymore and then I found it on Amazon.  I still love the scent and every time I spray it on it brings back memories!</li>
    <li> I have used this scent for 40 years. I try a new perfume and end up coming back to it. I can&#x27;t get it at the store I used to get it at so I have had to learn to shop on line. Very happy to find it again.</li>
    <li> Although the picture shows a box that reads:  EAU DE COLOGNE, I received a bottle that had a sticker on the bottom that read:  EAU DE TOILETTE, MADE IN CHINA, FRAGRANCE MADE IN USA.  The cologne is darker in color than my previous purchases and the scent is just not the same.</li>
    <li> Just a great price. Don&#x27;t know how they do it but this is my Wife&#x27;s favorite. This price is less than half the local market.</li>
    <li> very feminine ..i get lots of good comments when I wear this..I have worn this fragrance for 40 years..gotta call that love</li>
    <li> I had an evil ex boyfriend that loved this perfume. He stunk, so did this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like overpowering smells from the 1970&#x27;s this one&#x27;s for you. Cloying and nauseating are what come to mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sort of reminds me of the old boyfriend...nauseating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish there was a hollow star rating.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Oriental&amp;#34; is a very popular perfume family but orientals with woodsy undertones are hard to find.  Consider Toujours Moi a find. Great sillage and long lasting.  A must.</li>
    <li> This is my mom&#x27;s favorite and I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores in years.</li>
    <li> I have been using and getting compliments on Toujours Moi for years. When Max Factor discontinued I was so upset.  Thanks to Dana, it is available again, I am thrilled but I must say it does not seem to last as long as the original .  Still happy to have it back!</li>
