      <li>/&gt;Since I am obssesed with makeup and love to do different styles all the TIME these brushes have been very helpful and have so many that I dont even use all of them!</li>
      <li>Overall its amazing</li>
      <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>The price was just right</li>
      <li>Brushes are soft and don&#x27;t break easily.</li>
      <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>
      <li>A couple brushes came apart, but I just dabbed on a little glue, and good to go.  </li>
      <li>hot glue fixes everything</li>
      <li>and it came with more than enough brushes!</li>
      <li>although the bigger brushes did not come like the picture i love them..</li>
      <li>A brush made from pubes would most likely be softer than these!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But the contour brush is the only one that is my favorite , it works really well!</li>
      <li>;)...</li>
      <li>Hairs fell out of brush on first use and handles came apart.</li>
      <li>Overall, The brushes are very soft and have a nice quality.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s soft, big and handy although it does carry a scent</li>
      <li>Brush bristles are too firm, a little more flexible would be great.</li>
      <li>, I could have add a few more dollars and get me other good quality brushes.</li>
      <li>Chose this rating because of how fast the item arrived after payment processed.</li>
      <li>Very low and cheap quality...</li>
      <li>Though the brushes are a fantastic size, I noticed that the hairs were already starting to fall out!</li>
      <li>but they look sturdy and don&#x27;t have much shedding</li>
      <li>Likes: Fast shipping*Great Price*Nice Brushes &amp; Case&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:</li>
      <li>Thanks just on the time</li>
      <li>really ruff</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better set of brushes for a professional artist such as myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Most of the brushes are all synthetic and plasticy and do not really get a hold of the eyeshadow you are trying to use, all the eyebrushes pretty much look all the same except the width.</li>
      <li>However i do wish the brushes were a little bit more softer.</li>
      <li>For those that are new to using makeup brushes, you&#x27;ll want a set of brushes that have the type of brush there are on the end of it so that you know what ones you are using when your making a video about it.</li>
      <li>If you have a need for a professional set of brushes without breaking the bank, these are the way to go!</li>
      <li>You get a bunch of brushes that are the exact same thing.</li>
      <li>I fixed some with glue</li>
      <li>but so far i guess thats it</li>
      <li>I really like this set, especially the price.  </li>
      <li>and omg they r sooo soft.</li>
      <li>But, the soft leather wrap that they come in is a choice item to have for a brush-fiend like me.</li>
      <li>They are very coarse and not that soft.</li>
      <li>okay one of mine came broken</li>
      <li>okay one brush came broken but</li>
      <li>The brush cleaner turned dark brown after dipping and gently swishing one brush.  </li>
      <li>tat said it was good and didn&#x27;t had much shedding, but really it&#x27;s the worst brush set even for a beginner, hairs all over...</li>

<li> The &#x27;chemical&#x27; smell that everyone is talking about is more of a plastic smell and isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
<li> as far as shedding so far there is none ill update once i wash them.</li>
<li> The bristles are so rough on your face</li>
<li> just wish it would also come in pink :D.</li>
<li> The only thing it&#x27;s missing is the labels in each brush.</li>
<li> I hung them upside down to dry.  </li>
<li> The little brushes are so tough and straight</li>
<li> this is nothing like what other reviewers described, the quality is bad, unevenly cut edges, hairs falling off; i do know that it&#x27;s common that a few hairs would fall off from good brushes</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I received this product in the mail a few days ago, and I was impressed until I took a closer look. Though the brushes are a fantastic size, I noticed that the hairs were already starting to fall out! Also, there are 3 of 1 brush, 2 of another, and 2 pairs of 2 that are very similar to eachother! :( Overall, The brushes are very soft and have a nice quality. I just wish that my THIRTY-TWO piece set, didn&#x27;t turn out to be a 27 piece set (because of the repeats)!!!</li>
    <li> i got them just in time for christmas and its christmas eve now. i just opened them up and omg they r sooo soft. and theres a great veriety. the leather case does smell but it doesnt bother me. as far as shedding so far there is none ill update once i wash them. i will deff buy again :)))</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I really like this set, especially the price.  A couple brushes came apart, but I just dabbed on a little glue, and good to go.  Still a good deal.  I even bought a second set, one for work, one for home.</li>
    <li> this is nothing like what other reviewers described, the quality is bad, unevenly cut edges, hairs falling off; i do know that it&#x27;s common that a few hairs would fall off from good brushes but this is the worst than a few strands, falls off every time i use it. the only good thing i like about it is the leather case, it&#x27;s soft, big and handy although it does carry a scent but that would air off. the brushes i received were nothing like in the picture, the hairs were more of a reddish-black color than the pic. I bought it after reading the reviews tat said it was good and didn&#x27;t had much shedding, but really it&#x27;s the worst brush set even for a beginner, hairs all over... I&#x27;m just disappointed that it&#x27;s that bad, I could have add a few more dollars and get me other good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Came in a timely fashion. Included all pieces. Had a weird smell once opened and the brush bristles shed during application of makeup.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect the bigger brushes to work. Those are the kinds of brushes you need to spend good money on anyways. The rest of the brushes are wonderful and i am very content with everything. Shipping was super fast.</li>
    <li> These brushes are more than what I had hoped for. The &#x27;chemical&#x27; smell that everyone is talking about is more of a plastic smell and isn&#x27;t that bad. And they&#x27;re really soft and there&#x27;s a good variety of brushes. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> these makeup brushes suck! i don&#x27;t even use them to do my makeup what a waste of money. don&#x27;t spend the money on these</li>
    <li> The brushes are prickly and hair falls everywhere. Dont get it, invest in something softer and better quality. You&#x27;ll thank me</li>
    <li> for the price there okay one brush came broken but hot glue fixes everything :/............. so yeah i mean i gues you can buy them there okay one of mine came broken but so far i guess thats it</li>
    <li> i love my brushes! although the bigger brushes did not come like the picture i love them.. and im sure you wont find this amount of brushes for this amazing price... only thing i did kind of disliked is that then smaller brushes are not blendable like its hard to do eye make up with them... but other than that i like them every well.</li>
    <li> I was in need of an actual set of make up brushes(instead of buying some here and there) and came across this. The price was just right and it came with more than enough brushes! However i do wish the brushes were a little bit more softer. Overall its amazing i love them!</li>
    <li> I purchased these because of the price and I completely love them!... there are so many of them!..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am obssesed with makeup and love to do different styles all the TIME these brushes have been very helpful and have so many that I dont even use all of them! ;)... they do not smell at all! I would deff purchase again soon! just wish it would also come in pink :D.</li>
    <li> I loved them, they&#x27;re great &amp; the price is too. I don&#x27;t think I could ever find so many brushes at this price &amp; the quality is pretty good.</li>
    <li> I use them a lot. And they came nicely packaged. Brushes are soft and don&#x27;t break easily. Lots of variety of brushes too.</li>
    <li> Awful brushes! They stink and they shed really really bad! Save your money.</li>
    <li> I cant say enough about this product. you get extras if one breaks. every size aviable. brisles are soft but firm. nice leather pouch. its really nice.</li>
    <li> This is a very good set of brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought! Loved the price as well it was worth every penny</li>
    <li> So disappointed with these brushes. Very low and cheap quality...I would not recommend buying. :(</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes. .. I definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> I wish the bag was better quality but the brushes are very soft!</li>
    <li> Thanks just on the time</li>
    <li> These are crap they shed so much they don&#x27;t pick up any product what so ever ! The bristles are so rough on your face and it leave shredded hair on me its gross ! The little brushes are so tough and straight they don&#x27;t pick up any thing ! Horrible!!!!</li>
    <li> Brush bristles are too firm, a little more flexible would be great.</li>
    <li> Hairs fell out of brush on first use and handles came apart.</li>
    <li> I did not like this at all it took forever to ship in and they quality was quite bad they had a bad stench even after I washed them a few times and the bristles were coming out while I was doing my makeup and I didn&#x27;t like the quality of them they were not soft at all they felt really ruff I wish I would have liked them but I didn&#x27;t sadly I would not recommend this to anybody</li>
    <li> nice for beginners but cheaply made, hairs fall off.. But the contour brush is the only one that is my favorite , it works really well!</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the person loved it she was very happy it arrived on time and it was just what she wanted. I would recommend this to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> overall i like the set it came just as described ... yes it a little of a chemical smell but it went away the next day i haven&#x27;t used them yet but they look sturdy and don&#x27;t have much shedding</li>
    <li> Great Item, arrived as described, brand new in protective packaging. Chose this rating because of how fast the item arrived after payment processed. Quick delivery, fast shipper, great seller, and the list goes on and on. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better set of brushes for a professional artist such as myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who sees my high quality brush set, even though I only paid a small amount for them. will gladly tell anyone who sees them and asks about it, plus anyone who reads my review on here. If you have a need for a professional set of brushes without breaking the bank, these are the way to go!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, I was looking for a pack that had a bunch of them and some copied ones incase I were to lose a brush and this pack is wonderful I even gave my sister a few brushes. Shipment was good and easy and this is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Very good product. The case is perfect each brush has its space. The only thing it&#x27;s missing is the labels in each brush.</li>
    <li> I like it  but it didn&#x27;t tell you what all the brush were use for.</li>
    <li> I think this is really good with the different variety that they have. I recommend this to people if you like doing make-up ​</li>
    <li> They came fast and they are perfect I have had them for a couple months now and the only problem is that the eye-shadow sponge brush thingy comes off but there are three in the set so it works out!! I&#x27;ve used them on several people and myself... No breakouts whatsoever. They clean really easily I would reccomend</li>
    <li> The brushes shed worse than a dog in summer! I tried washing it to see if the shedding would go down, not at all, in fact it just made it worse. They are very coarse and not that soft. Most of the brushes are all synthetic and plasticy and do not really get a hold of the eyeshadow you are trying to use, all the eyebrushes pretty much look all the same except the width.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and really good product...</li>
    <li> The brushes feel like plastic on my face</li>
    <li> Likes: Fast shipping*Great Price*Nice Brushes &amp; Case&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes: For those that are new to using makeup brushes, you&#x27;ll want a set of brushes that have the type of brush there are on the end of it so that you know what ones you are using when your making a video about it. These did not.(Ex: Didn&#x27;t have the words smudge brush on the end)&lt;br /&gt;Other then that the brushes you see in the photo are the brushes your getting. There nice and I can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
    <li> The brushes fall apart very easily. I fixed some with glue but it fell apart again. You get a bunch of brushes that are the exact same thing. They left out some of the bigger brushes and just gave me duplicates. Save your money and invest in a few nicer brushes.</li>
    <li> I had to air out the brushes for a few weeks before I attempted to use them.  Washed the brushes in MAC brush cleaner before using.  Thank goodness I did wash them before.  The brush cleaner turned dark brown after dipping and gently swishing one brush.  As I turned the 2nd brush upside down to dip in the cleanser, the metal part and the handle separated!  At that point I realized that the quality of these brushes are, well...crap.  Instead of wasting my MAc brush cleanser I used dish soap to clean them.  I hung them upside down to dry.  Couple hours later noticed that the handles were still hanging, but the metal/brush parts were detached from the handles.  After they finally dried I gently tested the softness of the hairs on the back of my hand.  The fibers/hairs were so coarse!  A brush made from pubes would most likely be softer than these!&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend using these on ones face.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, packaged nicely and was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for the actual brush holder. These brushes are crap. But, the soft leather wrap that they come in is a choice item to have for a brush-fiend like me. Totally worth the money. Love this thing!</li>
