### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so, these things are great!</li>
      <li>These are great !!</li>
      <li>This one is the best for removing food that&#x27;s stuck between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They still work great</li>
      <li>This works great for me.</li>
      <li>While this is yet another plastic that goes into the landfill, they really do a great job.</li>
      <li>I got some from a dentist and found I could re-order on Amazon  at a great price.</li>
      <li>great service and product</li>
      <li>These are great.  </li>
      <li>Very effective and much better (and safer!)than trying to floss while you drive!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Years ago, I could get fairly flexible brush picks</li>
      <li>BrushPicks are pretty good, too, and make a good partner for OpalPix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>To make sure I use it every day, I think of it as a tool, and my teeth as a project.  </li>
      <li>I love the opalpix toothpicks.  </li>
      <li>I think these were the thinnest and most helpful for my cleaning needs.</li>
      <li>I use each pick for a week (ok&#x27;d by dentist), so the price is negligible compared to the price of gingivitis.</li>
      <li>is the best, in my experience, and Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks are in second place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love them easy to use</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re  not quite as sturdy as the ones I had, but they work fine &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re using them to just get stuck food out of your molars at a restaurant (like a toothpick), you&#x27;re probably fine, but I wouldn&#x27;t use them as a gum stimulator.</li>
      <li>My favorite toothpicks with quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Projects are more fun than hygiene.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to try them for the first time.</li>
      <li>SoftPicks are good for light cleaning between teeth, but aren&#x27;t rigid enough to remove stubborn bits of food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doctor&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Better than wooden toothpicks for your teeth !</li>
      <li>Who wants to talk about or hear about toothpicks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Gum picks are very flexible, but break before I&#x27;ve done my whole mouth.</li>
      <li>I think Opalpix has improved my gum health as much as my $100 electric tooth brush and my $50 waterpik.  </li>
      <li>They are just not quite flexible and soft enough for me to give them more</li>
      <li>I use these picks to clean gel/oil type residues between narrow crevices and have tried almost every plastic pick available.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been looking for picks similar to these for a long time, so was glad to find these.</li>
      <li>They are the only toothpicks I use  as they are just the right size for me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using them too vigorously, but I&#x27;m going to steer clear of these from now on.</li>
      <li>They are very durable and you can use them multiple times.  </li>
      <li>These are pretty well made, just not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Thin plastic pick, really easy for between teeth.</li>

    <li> I think Opalpix has improved my gum health as much as my $100 electric tooth brush and my $50 waterpik.  To make sure I use it every day, I think of it as a tool, and my teeth as a project.  Projects are more fun than hygiene.  It&#x27;s a thin, tiny file that&#x27;s used to clean the teeth under the gum line.  Use a mirror so you can see that you&#x27;re getting under the gum line. I bought the single pack for $4.49 with no extra charge for postage.  I use each pick for a week (ok&#x27;d by dentist), so the price is negligible compared to the price of gingivitis.</li>
    <li> I like these picks.  They are very durable and you can use them multiple times.  I&#x27;m glad I decided to try them for the first time.</li>
    <li> I used to be a dental assistant. These are great !! Better than wooden toothpicks for your teeth !</li>
    <li> These are pretty well made, just not exactly what I was looking for. They are just not quite flexible and soft enough for me to give them more stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, I could get fairly flexible brush picks (yes, i know these are not brush picks!) at a discount big-box retailer. ILO ved them! After a while, the ones sold there9 though looking exactly the same) switched to a harder, less flexible plastic that hurts my guns when I must remove food particles. I have been on the hunt for a replacement pick that is not only flexible, but reusable. Gum picks are very flexible, but break before I&#x27;ve done my whole mouth. Though these are not as hard as the stiff brush picks, I&#x27;m still searching.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpicks with quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I use these picks to clean gel/oil type residues between narrow crevices and have tried almost every plastic pick available. I think these were the thinnest and most helpful for my cleaning needs.</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of time in my car traveling between clients.  Wanted something to use after meals.  This works great for me.</li>
    <li> Who wants to talk about or hear about toothpicks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, these things are great! I got some from a dentist and found I could re-order on Amazon  at a great price. I think 15 packs come in a box, so you can give them to your friends and still have enough for a year or so. Very effective and much better (and safer!)than trying to floss while you drive!!</li>
    <li> great service and product</li>
    <li> works in tight spaces</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds of plastic toothpicks and flossers. This one is the best for removing food that&#x27;s stuck between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rotadent is too thick and hard. I couldn&#x27;t believe that my dentist recommended them! They feel like they&#x27;re damaging the gums instead of helping them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GIM GoBetweens are stiff wirey brushes. Again they feel like they could be damaging my gums. Plus, I&#x27;m concerned about the safety of the antimicrobial treatment that&#x27;s embedded in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GUM SoftPicks are good for light cleaning between teeth, but aren&#x27;t rigid enough to remove stubborn bits of food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks are pretty good, too, and make a good partner for OpalPix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OpalPix is the best, in my experience, and Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks are in second place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Love them easy to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking for picks similar to these for a long time, so was glad to find these. They&#x27;re  not quite as sturdy as the ones I had, but they work fine &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price. They were packed well &amp; shipped on time. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love the opalpix toothpicks.  They are the only toothpicks I use  as they are just the right size for me.</li>
    <li> Thin plastic pick, really easy for between teeth.</li>
    <li> While this is yet another plastic that goes into the landfill, they really do a great job. I keep them in the car and use them during the day when tooth brushing isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with the product.  It just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.  I was looking for the Rotopoint but I didn&#x27;t know the name of the product.</li>
    <li> These are softer than other picks I&#x27;ve used which has it&#x27;s pros and cons. They still work great and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> These are great.  Throw away your floss string!  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought these after receiving a sample set from my orthodontist on my last visit. Since I have wires on the back of my teeth that act as permanent braces, I&#x27;m unable to floss my upper and lower front 6 teeth. I used these (in conjunction with regular dental floss) for nearly a year before my dentist accused me of not brushing and flossing everyday. They are supposed to &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; the gums, but ended up causing my gums to bleed often and begin to recede - I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using them too vigorously, but I&#x27;m going to steer clear of these from now on. If you&#x27;re using them to just get stuck food out of your molars at a restaurant (like a toothpick), you&#x27;re probably fine, but I wouldn&#x27;t use them as a gum stimulator.</li>
