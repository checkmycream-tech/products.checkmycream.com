### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Before purchasing this I was impressed with what everyone had to say.  </li>
      <li>This dryer is awesome!  </li>
      <li>Best hair dryer!!</li>
      <li>You ladies who have wavy-frizzy, almost-curly hair, this thing is great!</li>
      <li>Great buy!</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; is lukewarm at best and the is no power in the air flow.</li>
      <li>I was going to use the extensions for drying my hair, but the dryer works perfect without them.</li>
      <li>you are looking for a great quality hair dryer</li>
      <li>My favorite hairdryer ever!!</li>
      <li>It is a good blow dryer though.</li>
      <li>&gt; Love this hair dryer!</li>
      <li>My hair has never come put better since I got this!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Because it dries hair so well, I&#x27;m granting this hair dryer some stars, but because Conair has greatly compromised what once was a fantastic dryer by now using inferior materials with crummy durability, I cannot recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It is a nice color though.</li>
      <li>Conair has degraded what used to be one of the best hair dryers out there for gently drying without frizz.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This dryer also has a nice sturdy loop for hanging it up in the bathroom or wherever you want to hang</li>
      <li>Nice accessories/features for the price.</li>
      <li>I use a straightener that uses ions to help straighten my hair, and it&#x27;s nice that this hair dryer doesn&#x27;t make my hair all staticy</li>
      <li>I have never used the concentrator / diffuser accessories that come with it, so I cannot comment on those, but I highly recommend this hair dryer to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune for a great product!!</li>
      <li>By far the best hairdryer I have ever used!</li>
      <li>This was my first time getting a blow dryer with a Diffuser piece, and it works beautifully.</li>
      <li>Love ,Love ,Love this dryer!  </li>
      <li>The dryer can be very very hot, which is good.</li>
      <li>What I love about it most is the Qualities/Options it has to offer that you JUST can&#x27;t find too often in MOST Hair Dryers these days.  </li>
      <li>Do you shell out $30-50 on a hair dryer, with outstanding drying results</li>
      <li>The dryer was okay</li>
      <li>/&gt;Based on the price difference between this hairdryer and the next best one (about $80)</li>
      <li>3 More times after I \\&quot;Wore Out\\&quot; (sort of speak)</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I have had this hairdryer for several years and it still works perfectly.</li>
      <li>cord is longer than most dryers that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>I love everything their IS to love about this Hair Dryer.  </li>
      <li>The customer service was excellent, and as I stated to him - I do appreciate the extra effort he took in handling the matter.  </li>
      <li>I love the diffuser too.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the hair result that made me fall in love with this dryer to begin with.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I found my original beloved hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is great on my curly hair and I can&#x27;t find a new blow dryer that works just like this one.</li>
      <li>It has a variety of speeds which is incredibly useful depending on what type of hair you have, even a TURBO button which makes any temperature or speed faster and more efficient, which comes in handy when you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
      <li>I wanted to get a good dryer that didn&#x27;t weigh too much, and this one is a full size dryer without the weight, which I really liked.</li>
      <li>First, let me say that this is a nice quality hairdryer, the attachments are sturdy and stay on securely, and the options for high/low heat, high/low power, and ion shine on/off are nice.  </li>
      <li>I will update this once I start using it more often if I run into anything else that everyone may want to know, but so far, I LOVE IT!!</li>
      <li>It is just the best of all worlds, especially the easy access to clean the filter.</li>
      <li>I had purchased this hair dryer a couple of years ago and loved it so much that when I saw it on Amazon had to order it in case the one I have ever broke.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to accidentally press them while drying your hair.</li>
      <li>but it just kept going strong.</li>
      <li>I have tried this dryer on every combination of settings and even with the diffuser and the dryer set on the lowest speed, the airflow is so strong that it blows out my curls.  </li>
      <li>I use this on the hot, turbo, Ion Shine setting and it works wonderfully to give my otherwise dull looking hair a nice, healthy sheen.</li>
      <li>A tap with my nail returns a cheap plastic sound like you&#x27;d get off a toy Nerf</li>
      <li>I called, and the hair dryer checked out as a genuine model.</li>
      <li>An EVEN more Rare quality is the \\&quot;Hinged Filter\\&quot;, and don&#x27;t get me started on the Ion On/Off Switch with LED</li>
      <li>Switch\\&quot; this ability is my ABSOLUTE Favorite.:)  </li>
      <li>While holding the handle your fingers are right over top of them.  </li>
      <li>I bought my original from a Walmart shelf, everything in the box was secured by cardboard so nothing inside moved.</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time a couple of days ago, and I LOVE the ionizer.</li>
      <li>original plug is a rectangle.</li>
      <li>(if that&#x27;s a word lol) I really like the different settings of heat and power that are available.</li>
      <li>Although not the fault of the seller, he contacted me and provided a full refund for the dryer.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely buy from this supplier in the future, and I would encourage anyone who is looking for excellent customer service as well as a good product, to also do the same.</li>
      <li>Which are: The Ability to choose either Hot Or Cool Temperatures, available all do to the 3 Heat Settings \\&quot;People MUST understand &amp; Realize, as well as appreciate</li>
      <li>system comes with three attachments to use to achieve certain styles, they each easily snap on and off.</li>
      <li>Since what I&#x27;d gotten was plainly different than the hair dryer I first had, loved, and was trying to replace, and Conair \\&quot;hadn&#x27;t changed the</li>
      <li>That core thing, fortunately, is still with this hair dryer, and it truly is this dryer&#x27;s sole redeeming quality.</li>
      <li>Are these cheap design choices worth this much money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The new one is more compact in a funny wave shape, and the test and reset buttons are narrower, stick out a mile, and feel tenuous.</li>
      <li>I have fine straight hair that dries very fast.  </li>
      <li>I have ALWAYS wanted to give this Item 5 Stars, but quite frankly I believe that someday, one day, an EVEN better, most likely UNNECESSARY powerful, Over The Top, Hair Dryerwill be invented that will steal/rob the title and be very Worthy of Each &amp; Every 1 of those 5 Stars, but for now THIS is the Hair Dryer for me.:)</li>
      <li>and it also has the Turbo button on it and dries my hair super fast!</li>
      <li>have to ask, knowing the external differences between the original model and this current one, are the internal components in the motor of this wonderful ionic technology drying system also now made with inferior parts, so it may do a fabulous job for the first couple of months</li>
      <li>It does the job and the price is right.</li>
      <li>came right on time</li>
      <li>For myself, I am ordering another Hot Tools dryer in a lower wattage (1600), which is what my old one was, and hope for better results.  </li>
      <li>top and the bottom of the dryer&#x27;s nose have two prominent grooved seams down the length of the unit.</li>
      <li>A very Appreciated &amp; Rare Quality is the \\&quot;Turbo</li>
      <li>bought this three times trying to replace my original hair dryer that finally croaked after over seven years of daily use--three purchases because I loved this hair dryer and kept thinking I was getting fakes.</li>
      <li>I think this dryer would work great for someone with straight hair and plan to give it to my teenage son so he can stop stealing his sister&#x27;s dryer, so it is not a total waste, though he would have been happy with a $15 model from a discount store.  </li>
      <li>We were so happy to find this to replace our last Conair of this same model.</li>
      <li>This was is pretty light weight, comes with all the attachments, can be cleaned and stored very easily and the noise level is about average.  </li>
      <li>Lightweight, great range of settings, considerably more quiet than my prior model, ease of cleaning, and relatively efficient describe the model for me.  </li>
      <li>I purchased my first one and it lasted for almost 3 years ($21.99).  </li>
      <li>I first bought this about four years ago</li>
      <li>I continued to be pleased, however it had a noticeably shorter life span, lasting 6 months.  </li>
      <li>Since it is my first I have nothing to compare it to, but I have no complaints.</li>
      <li>I truly feel that it is totally ME. :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;After my first purchase, seeing the difference in the dryer I got from the one I had owned, I called Conair to ask if anything on the dryer had been updated or modified.</li>
      <li>It even hangs different from my scalp--lighter, better.</li>
      <li>I love Conair products, especially this Tourmaline Ceramic Dryer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;THE ONLY REDEEMING QUALITY,</li>
      <li>and I have loved it everyday since then.</li>
      <li>I tried a new hairstyle for one year (African-American, Natural hair, cut in a short bob, straightened by a flat iron with NO chemical use) and this came in handy after my old one busted, heated up, and made sparks fly.</li>
      <li>I would rate this dryer one star for myself because it does not work on my curls, but will give it three stars since I expect it will do a nice job for other hair types.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The second and third orders came in good timing.</li>
      <li>I even was able to maintain my look without using the flat iron as much.</li>
      <li>my first purchase, what came was the box shown on Amazon&#x27;s site (light background with lilac circles patterns and purple and yellow highlights on the rest of the box).</li>
      <li>It did an excellent job drying my very thick and curly long hair - probably cut a good ten minutes off my drying time, actually.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The casing now may be cheap junk that cracks easily, and the plug buttons make get broken off because they stick out too far, but the hair drying results this produces is the exact same as the original version of this model: smooth, soft, hair full of body and sheen.</li>
      <li>The same cheap plastic hair dryer came in the mail.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lightweight dryer which is easier on the arms but doesn&#x27;t have as much drying power as I thought it would.  </li>
      <li>fast shipping and as described.  </li>
      <li>the comb pulls the hair straight the diffuser keeps it curly</li>
      <li>It dries my hair fast w/out frizz.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this to replace my previous Conair hair dryer. It dries my hair fast w/out frizz. Nice accessories/features for the price.</li>
    <li> My favorite hairdryer ever!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer for years and it still works but I wanted to order another one in case anything happens to mine because the new blow dryers that are out now are terrible. This is great on my curly hair and I can&#x27;t find a new blow dryer that works just like this one.</li>
    <li> Hi, I am SGT Phanomenal.  I have purchased this Item in the past in my Local Walmart in Fresno, CA and has ALWAYS been satisfied with the Transaction.  I have purchased this Exact Same CONAIR Hair Dryer, as well as the EXACT same Model 3 More times after I \\&quot;Wore Out\\&quot; (sort of speak) my previously owned ones.:P  I love everything their IS to love about this Hair Dryer.  I truly feel that it is totally ME. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I love the \\&quot;Idea\\&quot; of the Tourmaline Ceramic Technology, I also like the 1875 Watts of Strength/Power it has to offer (which is the Typical Amount Of Watts).  What I love about it most is the Qualities/Options it has to offer that you JUST can&#x27;t find too often in MOST Hair Dryers these days.  Which are: The Ability to choose either Hot Or Cool Temperatures, available all do to the 3 Heat Settings \\&quot;People MUST understand &amp; Realize, as well as appreciate these options for is HELPS PREVENT the machine from Over Heating as well, as Longer Lasting Life of the Item/Machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  A very Appreciated &amp; Rare Quality is the \\&quot;Turbo Switch\\&quot; this ability is my ABSOLUTE Favorite.:)  An EVEN more Rare quality is the \\&quot;Hinged Filter\\&quot;, and don&#x27;t get me started on the Ion On/Off Switch with LED Interruptor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Only negative comment that I have to say about \\&quot;This Transaction In Particular\\&quot; is that I just recently received this Item by the Mail Man and it was not an Exact Replica of it&#x27;s previous Family Members.  It would appear to have lost it&#x27;s Glossy Coat, as well as it Metallic Red, Color?  I still obtain my Previous Hair Dryer of the Exact Same Model and it has a Chip in the Paint Job the size of a Quarter.  The \\&quot;New Hair Dryer\\&quot; that I received has the the Paint Job of my previous as if the ENTIRE First Layer of Paint has been chipped Off of my \\&quot;NEW\\&quot; purchase.:P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have ALWAYS wanted to give this Item 5 Stars, but quite frankly I believe that someday, one day, an EVEN better, most likely UNNECESSARY powerful, Over The Top, Hair Dryerwill be invented that will steal/rob the title and be very Worthy of Each &amp; Every 1 of those 5 Stars, but for now THIS is the Hair Dryer for me.:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair drying system for around 2 years now. I use it daily and I absolutely love it. I purchased mine at the Family Dollar for around $30. For reference, my hair is long, baby fine and wavy. My hair also takes forever to dry naturally.  I use this on the hot, turbo, Ion Shine setting and it works wonderfully to give my otherwise dull looking hair a nice, healthy sheen. It will dry my hard-to-dry hair in less than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blow dryer has three temperature options for blow drying:  hot, cold and warm. It also has a sliding switch for turning the Ion Shine feature on/off. It has two blow drying settings of low/high. It also has a switch for the turbo setting or the cold setting (for setting your style).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This system comes with three attachments to use to achieve certain styles, they each easily snap on and off. This dryer has 2 air intake filters on the back of the dryer. The outermost air intake filter is easily cleaned as it snaps open and closed on a hinge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is longer than most dryers that I&#x27;ve used.  The plug-in has a safety plug-in that if overloaded will stop the blow dryer and you can reset it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer also has a nice sturdy loop for hanging it up in the bathroom or wherever you want to hang it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this hair drying system to anyone, it&#x27;s sturdy and it lasts with everyday use.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and as described.  thank you</li>
    <li> This dryer is awesome!  Im a black woman and this dryer blows my hair straight, keeps me from having to relax my hair so often.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Purchased this after seeing all the reviews and a recommendation from my hair stylist. I tried a new hairstyle for one year (African-American, Natural hair, cut in a short bob, straightened by a flat iron with NO chemical use) and this came in handy after my old one busted, heated up, and made sparks fly. This was is pretty light weight, comes with all the attachments, can be cleaned and stored very easily and the noise level is about average.  Will recommend to anyone looking for a dryer for all the styles you need. I even was able to maintain my look without using the flat iron as much.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice that the ionic does anything extra. It is a good blow dryer though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lightweight dryer which is easier on the arms but doesn&#x27;t have as much drying power as I thought it would.  Does help on the frizziness of thick straight hair.</li>
    <li> Conair has degraded what used to be one of the best hair dryers out there for gently drying without frizz. When this first came out, the unit&#x27;s housing was a solid, drop-resilient material with a deep warm red sheen. What Conair produces now is a cheap, brittle plastic, pinkish red hair dryer that is such poor quality I thought it was a fake. But it contains a secret weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PURCHASE EXPERIENCE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this three times trying to replace my original hair dryer that finally croaked after over seven years of daily use--three purchases because I loved this hair dryer and kept thinking I was getting fakes. (See below.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first ordered this product on May 9 from a third party seller, fulfilled by Amazon. It was marked as shipped right after that, but I received the product June 4, which may or may not have been due to delays with other items in the order, though they were all marked as shipped right away. Amazon eventually deemed it lost, refunded, and then it finally arrived--hard to tell who was at fault there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second and third orders came in good timing. The second seller, take_your_kid_fishing, left an outstanding impression on me in his concern, care, and conduct throughout whether or not this product was a fake. If you order by third party and his name comes up, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy through him. Order three was through a third seller and the only one both sold and shipped by a third party vendor off Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW IT CAME&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my first purchase, what came was the box shown on Amazon&#x27;s site (light background with lilac circles patterns and purple and yellow highlights on the rest of the box). The box had crumpled clear packing tape on both ends and looked like it&#x27;d been re-taped. The diffuser and hair dryer both had plastic sheaths on it while the concentrator attachment was loose and unsheathed. Everything in the box was loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought my original from a Walmart shelf, everything in the box was secured by cardboard so nothing inside moved. Not so here. When I pulled out the concentrator, a piece of cut hair was clinging to it, and I found a few more inside the plastic bag that was around the dryer. Ew! Based on my following two purchases from other sellers, I&#x27;m guessing this first product arrival was a return. Subsequent dryers did not have hair particles in the boxes, though the loose packing was the same across all three purchases. The latter two were not taped shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT ASSESSMENT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer looks almost exactly like the original version of the product, so close, in fact, that I second guessed numerous times if I wasn&#x27;t just crazy that it was different than my original, but there are a few undeniable changes, most noticeably, the housing and plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original plug is a rectangle. The new one is more compact in a funny wave shape, and the test and reset buttons are narrower, stick out a mile, and feel tenuous. The yellow test button on the original is actually a circle, positioned under and to the right of the reset button. On the one that came, the yellow test button is directly below the reset button and is oblong, not a circle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The housing is clearly cheap brittle plastic, not the hard resilient material I&#x27;m used to in the original. The first indicator was the lack of deep warm, red polished shine, exchanged for a duller lighter red with swirls in the plastic that reminds me of wet nail polish. A tap with my nail returns a cheap plastic sound like you&#x27;d get off a toy Nerf gun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top and the bottom of the dryer&#x27;s nose have two prominent grooved seams down the length of the unit. When I pressed moderately beside the seam, the plastic gave, the seam separated slightly, and the entire half moved away from the other half. The original is firm and will not give like this, and you certainly won&#x27;t hear creaking plastic upon manipulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my third purchase, the housing was actually cracked on the handle at both screw holes. The cracks extended from the holes to swirls on the rest of the handle and initially made it look like it was just plastic patterns, but my fingernail verified the plastic was broken. The cracks had made those swirl patterns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAKE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first purchase, seeing the difference in the dryer I got from the one I had owned, I called Conair to ask if anything on the dryer had been updated or modified. The rep told me it had not, but they still sold them, just not on their website (so I couldn&#x27;t verify what it looked like) so I&#x27;d have to find them through third party sellers. When I questioned her about what I had, explained the differences, and asked if it was a fake, she did not say one way or the other, and didn&#x27;t dissuade me when I said, \\&quot;So it&#x27;s a fake?\\&quot; She just emphasized the model hadn&#x27;t changed and she couldn&#x27;t tell me where to buy it. Since what I&#x27;d gotten was plainly different than the hair dryer I first had, loved, and was trying to replace, and Conair \\&quot;hadn&#x27;t changed the model,\\&quot; I presumed this other thing I&#x27;d gotten was a fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I bought from another seller. The same cheap plastic hair dryer came in the mail. I returned it for being a knockoff and Amazon advised me to buy off their site from a third party seller to get it from different stock. What came was the same cheapy pinkish red thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third and final Amazon seller told me to go to Conair and check the serial number on the dryer to verify it as genuine. I called, and the hair dryer checked out as a genuine model. When I questioned the second Conair rep about what the first rep told me, he said the product shows no information on his computer other than that it exists, but that does not mean the model hasn&#x27;t been modified. So the first Conair rep I talked to assumed incorrectly that it had not been changed, simply because she had no information that it had, led me to believe this altered version of the dryer was a fake, and didn&#x27;t correct me when I named it as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE ONLY REDEEMING QUALITY, AND IT&#x27;S A BIGGIE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I bought this model hair dryer for way back in the beginning, was I needed a hair dryer with a low pitch motor to save my ear drums. In that original version I found that and something bigger. That core thing, fortunately, is still with this hair dryer, and it truly is this dryer&#x27;s sole redeeming quality. It&#x27;s the hair drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The casing now may be cheap junk that cracks easily, and the plug buttons make get broken off because they stick out too far, but the hair drying results this produces is the exact same as the original version of this model: smooth, soft, hair full of body and sheen. After having frizz-head for the past two months with the Conair ionic cord-keeper, which I thought was supposed to dry the same (but didn&#x27;t) since it too had \\&quot;ionic drying technology,\\&quot; I briefly found again my long lost lovely hair. My fine, straggly hair once again became full-bodied with sheen and felt soft soft soft. It even hangs different from my scalp--lighter, better. It&#x27;s like I found the old me, albeit, briefly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the hair result that made me fall in love with this dryer to begin with. And it&#x27;s still there, hidden in an inferior shell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CONUNDRUM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my problem. Do you shell out $30-50 on a hair dryer, with outstanding drying results, that may not last long because it&#x27;s housed in a  cheap body that cannot withstand long-term use, or do you opt instead for a unit that dries equally well and is made with better quality you can count on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to ask, knowing the external differences between the original model and this current one, are the internal components in the motor of this wonderful ionic technology drying system also now made with inferior parts, so it may do a fabulous job for the first couple of months but then crap out? If the body&#x27;s housing cannot withstand screw tightening in the handle without cracking the casing around the holes, where else will structural integrity fail? Are these cheap design choices worth this much money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it&#x27;s not. I decided to search out old stock on eBay. Fortunately, I found my original beloved hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it dries hair so well, I&#x27;m granting this hair dryer some stars, but because Conair has greatly compromised what once was a fantastic dryer by now using inferior materials with crummy durability, I cannot recommend this product. It&#x27;s reduced to an overpriced throw-away dryer. I&#x27;d rather spend that amount of money on something that dries frizz-free AND contains quality workmanship.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that this is a nice quality hairdryer, the attachments are sturdy and stay on securely, and the options for high/low heat, high/low power, and ion shine on/off are nice.  It is an attractive, well made unit; however, I bought it specifically to dry my curly hair after my Hot Tools dryer died, and have been frustrated and disappointed with the results.  I have tried this dryer on every combination of settings and even with the diffuser and the dryer set on the lowest speed, the airflow is so strong that it blows out my curls.  I end up with a flyaway, frizzy mess.  I think this dryer would work great for someone with straight hair and plan to give it to my teenage son so he can stop stealing his sister&#x27;s dryer, so it is not a total waste, though he would have been happy with a $15 model from a discount store.  For myself, I am ordering another Hot Tools dryer in a lower wattage (1600), which is what my old one was, and hope for better results.  I would rate this dryer one star for myself because it does not work on my curls, but will give it three stars since I expect it will do a nice job for other hair types.</li>
    <li> Just reordered this after having this same one for 10 years and using it every day. Best hair dryer!!</li>
    <li> Lots of air but doesn&#x27;t seem to dry anything</li>
    <li> I was disappointed.  I did not like the end results in the way it styled.  The dryer was okay but it left something to be desired all around.</li>
    <li> You ladies who have wavy-frizzy, almost-curly hair, this thing is great! The diffuser will keep the frizz to a minimum and maximize curl. It also works very quickly to dry my longish, thick hair. I got a compliment on my hair today. That says it all.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this I was impressed with what everyone had to say.  I&#x27;ve used it three times since I received it and if I had known about a few of the features I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.  The main thing that bugs me is the on/off and heating buttons.  While holding the handle your fingers are right over top of them.  Constantly either changing the heat setting or turning it off.  It&#x27;s very frustrating.  I have a lot of hair and even being new it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry very quick.  It&#x27;s heavier than other dryers I&#x27;ve had and in the photo it shows three tools it only came with two.  It is a nice color though.</li>
    <li> I first bought this about four years ago and I have loved it everyday since then. It&#x27;s traveled around the world with me and I&#x27;ve dropped it more than a few times but it just kept going strong. Mine finally bit the dust a few days ago and went to my local Wal-Mart to try and buy a new one, I got the closest thin  they had to this one and after using it once, I knew it just wasn&#x27;t going to be the same. But thank goodness for Amazon! My hair is saved!&lt;br /&gt; Love this hair dryer! I have thick slightly coarse long hair and it dries it in less than 10minutes. I love the diffuser too.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a great quality hair dryer get this one, it will not disappoint you!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is useless. The &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; is lukewarm at best and the is no power in the air flow. It would take me two hours to dry my hair with this.</li>
    <li> I actually like this dryer.  I purchased my first one and it lasted for almost 3 years ($21.99).  It works well with thick curly hair and when it died, I rushed out to by another one this past May 2014 ($31.99).  I continued to be pleased, however it had a noticeably shorter life span, lasting 6 months.  I wanted to stay with the same company, due to having all the attachments and being hopeful that this was a fluke.  I brought the new one for $44.99.</li>
    <li> Its Not what I expected but I do enjoy what I have the comb pulls the hair straight the diffuser keeps it curly came right on time</li>
    <li> I have had this hairdryer for several years and it still works perfectly. It drys my long, thick hair in around 5-7 min. By far the best hairdryer I have ever used! Would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I had this dryer for 5 years before it stopped drying. Bought the same one to replace it. The buttons used to be switches and now you press them....so it&#x27;s easy to accidentally press them while drying your hair. Other than that, love it. No frizz, lots of options (low, medium, high, hot, cold, warm, turbo, cold blast) great machine.</li>
    <li> We were so happy to find this to replace our last Conair of this same model. It is just the best of all worlds, especially the easy access to clean the filter. The biggest weakness we found was the black ring that is needed to keep the attachments in tight. If that breaks, it is tough to glue it back together and refit it.</li>
    <li> I like the hair dryer but a little loud as most hair dryers are.  It does the job and the price is right.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all that it claims to be!  Love ,Love ,Love this dryer!  My hair has never come put better since I got this!</li>
    <li> Gave this to my mother as a gift and on second day of her having it shipped to her address it stopped working, Pretty Annoying!</li>
    <li> I had this for a little over a year when it died on me. It did an excellent job drying my very thick and curly long hair - probably cut a good ten minutes off my drying time, actually. There was one big draw back with this dryer - and I&#x27;m aware it might make me sound like a bit of a wimp - but it is REALLY heavy. I had to take breaks from drying because my wrist would get tired.</li>
    <li> As I stated in my earlier posting.  The comb attachment was missing from my box.  However, the seller contacted me upon learning about this problem.  It was simply an error due to Amazon&#x27;s picture showing that item.  Although not the fault of the seller, he contacted me and provided a full refund for the dryer.  The customer service was excellent, and as I stated to him - I do appreciate the extra effort he took in handling the matter.  I will definitely buy from this supplier in the future, and I would encourage anyone who is looking for excellent customer service as well as a good product, to also do the same.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer because mine was going on 6 years and really started to sound bad. I used it for the first time a couple of days ago, and I LOVE the ionizer. I use a straightener that uses ions to help straighten my hair, and it&#x27;s nice that this hair dryer doesn&#x27;t make my hair all staticy (if that&#x27;s a word lol) I really like the different settings of heat and power that are available. Weight was also something that I was looking for. I wanted to get a good dryer that didn&#x27;t weigh too much, and this one is a full size dryer without the weight, which I really liked. I was going to use the extensions for drying my hair, but the dryer works perfect without them. I have curly thick hair, and this dryer dried my hair pretty quick and it came out really soft and shiny. I did notice that the cord is really short, and I don&#x27;t really care, but some people may find that to difficult depending on where you&#x27;re plugging it in. I will update this once I start using it more often if I run into anything else that everyone may want to know, but so far, I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This was my first time getting a blow dryer with a Diffuser piece, and it works beautifully. Since it is my first I have nothing to compare it to, but I have no complaints. The dryer can be very very hot, which is good. It has a variety of speeds which is incredibly useful depending on what type of hair you have, even a TURBO button which makes any temperature or speed faster and more efficient, which comes in handy when you&#x27;re in a rush. Hopefully this will last me a long time!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, here are her thoughts:  Lightweight, great range of settings, considerably more quiet than my prior model, ease of cleaning, and relatively efficient describe the model for me.  Push buttons are the new preference for me as my prior models had slide buttons that would eventually wear down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons: the attachments snap into place and I feel they may break in time.  The maximum heat setting with turbo is still less than my prior model so it takes a bit longer to finish the job.  Although new, you are forgoing the warranty availability but the discount is significant enough to make this okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the price difference between this hairdryer and the next best one (about $80) I would buy the same model again.</li>
    <li> I have fine straight hair that dries very fast.  I had purchased this hair dryer a couple of years ago and loved it so much that when I saw it on Amazon had to order it in case the one I have ever broke.  It doesn&#x27;t run so hot or blow so hard that you can&#x27;t get your hair styled before it is dry.  Or make it all tangled.  I would give this 10 stars if I could!!</li>
    <li> I love Conair products, especially this Tourmaline Ceramic Dryer. I finally had to break down and buy a new one because my other, while it still works, is making lots of extra, unwanted noise. I can&#x27;t even remember when I had bought my old one, that&#x27;s how long ago it was and how long it lasted! I like this hair dryer because it is lightweight and it also has the Turbo button on it and dries my hair super fast! I have never used the concentrator / diffuser accessories that come with it, so I cannot comment on those, but I highly recommend this hair dryer to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune for a great product!!</li>
