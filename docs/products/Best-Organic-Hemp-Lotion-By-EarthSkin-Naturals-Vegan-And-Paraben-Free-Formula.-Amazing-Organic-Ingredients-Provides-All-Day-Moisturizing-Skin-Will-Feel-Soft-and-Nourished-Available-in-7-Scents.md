      <li>Great Product, first time using it and exceeded all my expectations.</li>

      <li>This lotion is full of good stuff (as it says on the label).</li>
      <li>Smells super good, texture is soft smooth and feels wonderful on the skin!</li>
      <li>I give it 5 stars for sure.</li>
      <li>The stuff is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I love the ingredients,  </li>
      <li>Fantastic lotion!</li>
      <li>I just absolutely love this lotion.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>I love that this product is organic and that it comes in a glass bottle.</li>
      <li>but I think reviews that gave this product 5 stars are from people who never tried better body lotions before.</li>
      <li>I love it, I have eczema and this works well with my skin</li>
      <li>Better than &amp;#34;Josie&#x27;s whipped argan</li>
      <li>The scent was too overwhelming for me.  </li>
      <li>Rubs in very nicely and does not have petrolatum or parabens or even mineral oil in the ingredients which is desirable for people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My hands have never felt this smooth.  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not in it is important to me, which is all those carcinogenic ingredients.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more!!</li>
      <li>nothing special about it</li>
      <li>Scent is nice and fresh on the original formula- my husband uses it because it is a masculine fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Not so with this lotion; it is worthy of it&#x27;s 5 star rating.  </li>
      <li>Quite high priced compared to most drug store brands.  </li>
      <li>I will never buy this again, the smell is so strong that stays on the whole day unless you take a shower.</li>
      <li>Not tested on animals - that&#x27;s a HUGE positive for me.</li>
      <li>The texture seemed nice though, so perhaps I&#x27;ll try the unscented version next time.</li>
      <li>The lotion makes my skin silky soft, but the fragrance was too much for me, so be advised to wait for unscented if you are sensitive to fragrances, though it does smell very nice.</li>
      <li>yet it absorbs very well and smells fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>The first time I put it on my hands I could feel it going into the deeper layers of my skin, it was like my skin was sucking it all in.</li>
      <li>I really like the texture, it doesn&#x27;t just glide on the skin, It gets absorbed.</li>
      <li>This lotion makes my skin so soft and smooth</li>
      <li>The Original smell is extremely masculine.</li>
      <li>Haha.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and really got into it</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>High quality lotion though.</li>
      <li>After using this lotion for just a few days, they are already more moisturized.  </li>
      <li>but when I tried on I couldn&#x27;t handle the smell of a cheap product, results are  like any other body lotion</li>
      <li>My friends yesterday were asking what new perfume I am wearing and I wasn&#x27;t it was the fragrance from earthskin lotion.</li>
      <li>I am a little chemically sensitive, so I am cautious about using lotions; you know how some products smell good at first and then after a few minutes you have to wash your hands to get it off?  </li>
      <li>I came back to order more for my giant baby bump and see that it is currently unavailable.</li>
      <li>Fragrance its soothing and as soon as you apply it to your skin you can feel it in action.</li>
      <li>The natural oils and vitamin formula are nourishing and giving my skin a healthful glow.</li>
      <li>I tried a little of the lavender scented one because my daughter decided she didn&#x27;t like the lavender or the original scent.</li>
      <li>I put it next to my kitchen sink, and everyone who has used it has commented about how soft and youthful-looking it leaves their skin.</li>
      <li>Would buy it again, but am going to use it sparingly due to the higher price and smaller product size.</li>
      <li>Rich and thick</li>
      <li>As a former Esthetician, I am conscious of what I put on my skin, knowing the potential of ingredients to enter the bloodstream.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love it, I have eczema and this works well with my skin</li>
    <li> The Original smell is extremely masculine. The strength of it gave me an instant headache. High quality lotion though. Sent it back.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It smells wonderful and the ingredient list is amazing.  My skin feels great using it. I am a little chemically sensitive, so I am cautious about using lotions; you know how some products smell good at first and then after a few minutes you have to wash your hands to get it off?  Not so with this lotion; it is worthy of it&#x27;s 5 star rating.  What&#x27;s not in it is important to me, which is all those carcinogenic ingredients. BTW, my husband uses it and likes it, too.</li>
    <li> This lotion is pretty great. I&#x27;ve given it a couple of months of use before writing this. The smell is amazing and it&#x27;s incredibly hydrating without being sticky or greasy. I came back to order more for my giant baby bump and see that it is currently unavailable. I&#x27;m bummed to have to go out and find an alternative to this non-toxic and highly effective lotion.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and really got into it but when I tried on I couldn&#x27;t handle the smell of a cheap product, results are  like any other body lotion nothing special about it, I don;t want to be mean but I think reviews that gave this product 5 stars are from people who never tried better body lotions before. I should think about it &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34; my fault. I will never buy this again, the smell is so strong that stays on the whole day unless you take a shower.</li>
    <li> Great Product, first time using it and exceeded all my expectations. Fragrance its soothing and as soon as you apply it to your skin you can feel it in action.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing lotion! Smells super good, texture is soft smooth and feels wonderful on the skin! Leaves the skin hydrated but not sticky!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars because of the excellent customer service. The lotion makes my skin silky soft, but the fragrance was too much for me, so be advised to wait for unscented if you are sensitive to fragrances, though it does smell very nice. Superior customer service I recommend this company!</li>
    <li> Quite high priced compared to most drug store brands.  Scent is nice and fresh on the original formula- my husband uses it because it is a masculine fragrance.  Rubs in very nicely and does not have petrolatum or parabens or even mineral oil in the ingredients which is desirable for people with sensitive skin. Would buy it again, but am going to use it sparingly due to the higher price and smaller product size.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!!!!  I&#x27;m a stage IV breast cancer patient and chemo makes my skin really dry to where it peels.  I&#x27;ve searched and searched for lotions that will help with the peeling and nothing worked until I found this lotion.  This lotion makes my skin so soft and smooth and I can feel it nourishing my body.  The peeling stoped after only a week of use.  People have also noticed a change in my skin.  They say I no longer appear pale and have even made comments stating I&#x27;m the healthiest looking sick person they know.  I put it on everday after my shower.  The scent is amazing!!!!!  People have asked me what perfume I wear and I say &amp;#34;it&#x27;s my lotion.&amp;#34;  I would recommend this lotion to anyone healthy or sick.  You can feel the quality.  I won&#x27;t use any other lotions now.</li>
    <li> The stuff is fantastic! A little expensive but definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic lotion! I put it next to my kitchen sink, and everyone who has used it has commented about how soft and youthful-looking it leaves their skin. Great absorption, too! I&#x27;ll be back for more!!</li>
    <li> I tried a little of the lavender scented one because my daughter decided she didn&#x27;t like the lavender or the original scent. What I was disappointed about was the size! They did not say anywhere that it was only 8 oz. I thought it was a larger bottle. For that size it was way too expensive. Now I need to send back the one that wasn&#x27;t opened.</li>
    <li> The scent was too overwhelming for me.  Gave me a headache.  Even after I washed my hands the scent still lingered.  The texture seemed nice though, so perhaps I&#x27;ll try the unscented version next time.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent!  Moisturizing but not greasy.  I love that this product is organic and that it comes in a glass bottle.</li>
    <li> My husband Karl says &amp;#34;It is the best product I have every used&amp;#34;.  He will reorder shortly.</li>
    <li> I really like the texture, it doesn&#x27;t just glide on the skin, It gets absorbed. It smells delicious. I can&#x27;t get enough of it. Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible!  My hands have never felt this smooth.  I&#x27;m never using anything else. I mix a drop of an essential oil into it so I have whatever scent I desire (e.g. a calming scent at night). It mixes well with the Rocky Mountain oils.  It&#x27;s the best hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing!  My arms and legs have been dry and itchy.  After using this lotion for just a few days, they are already more moisturized.  But the best thing of all is the scent!  I LOVE the earthy aromatic fragrance of this lotion!  Will definitely be a repeat-customer.</li>
    <li> This all natural lotion is awesome. I can already feel the difference in my skin is softer and is only my second day using it. My friends yesterday were asking what new perfume I am wearing and I wasn&#x27;t it was the fragrance from earthskin lotion. Its texture is thick so a little goes a long way.  This is also a awesome gift for my vegan friends and family.</li>
    <li> Really love this product!  Great ingredients, fresh scent, and non greasy. Better than &amp;#34;Josie&#x27;s whipped argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;My husband is picky about scent and he liked the scent and the texture. Purchased extra for him. This is a winner.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this lotion and I love it! Not only is it a great moisturizer,but is a great anti aging product. My skin feels and looks younger. The natural oils and vitamin formula are nourishing and giving my skin a healthful glow.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of this moisturizer as a gift and I really like it. As a former Esthetician, I am conscious of what I put on my skin, knowing the potential of ingredients to enter the bloodstream. This lotion is full of good stuff (as it says on the label). Organic ingredients include aloe, shea butter, jojoba oil and green tea; but its free of preservatives and dyes that are irritating. Not tested on animals - that&#x27;s a HUGE positive for me. Rich and thick yet it absorbs very well and smells fresh and clean. I give it 5 stars for sure.</li>
    <li> I just absolutely love this lotion. I got the original scent it smells so good and it lasts all day. And it makes my dish pan hands disappear. The first time I put it on my hands I could feel it going into the deeper layers of my skin, it was like my skin was sucking it all in. I love the ingredients,  I&#x27;m real big on NOT putting garbage on my skin so I&#x27;m happy I found this product. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever find a lotion I loved, but I&#x27;ve found it! Now I have to decide if I wanna share it with my friends &amp; family or not! Haha. I will share...maybe.</li>
