### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but it is really wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Smells great!  </li>
      <li>Wonderful salts don&#x27;t need a lot !</li>
      <li>I am so happy I found it.</li>
      <li>It really is a great product</li>
      <li>Great soothing bath salts.</li>
      <li>They make great Christmas, birthday, valentine gifts.</li>
      <li>but these were very nice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Personally, I feel anyone can have a pleasant experience by trying this salt bath.</li>
      <li>you have nothing to add to your bath, and you bath regularly, it&#x27;s a good</li>
      <li>It also heats your body up and raises your heart rate, which is good to sweat out all the excess toxins.</li>
      <li>They both smell very pleasant, and the change to the bath color is fun.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought this!</li>
      <li>I love these!  </li>
      <li>I bought based on the glowing reviews that spoke of amazing scents.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Not only does it smell good and look good, it&#x27;s great for your skin!  </li>
      <li>After it&#x27;s in the water, it smells more like warm flowers</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s overwhelmingly flowery, but it wouldn&#x27;t be something I&#x27;d describe as neutral or</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect to be able to read the ingredients though.  </li>
      <li>Glad I found them here.</li>
      <li>The fragrance to me is a more unisex smell.</li>
      <li>it won&#x27;t be a choice for me to use when enjoying my bath.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Recently felt the need to write reviews for outstanding products I never got around to thanking.</li>
      <li>I would describe this more as a water softener or calgon type bath accessory than bath salts...</li>
      <li>prefer bath salts that are more just \\&quot;salts\\&quot; with and without scent...</li>
      <li>This item is my favorite of the Bath Roman series...</li>
      <li>I hope most can relax, enjoy and feel comfortable about taking on this new and wonderful experience by reading this review.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>people cannot fully enjoy most things as they were meant to be, but perhaps this is not one of them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>the smell is very mild, the look is like dish-washing powder, What we found was that we sweated a lot after the bath.</li>
      <li>Wow this is one of my new favorite bath products!!!</li>
      <li>It keeps the heat in longer and my skin afterwards is silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s good for someone with a severe medical condition, but it sure made me feel wonderful and calmed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Because I would always want the best for myself, and this is it.&lt;br /&gt;Although a different experience than most are used to, most will find it not difficult to encapsulate themselves into the different subtitles this brings.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>love this bath soak - light candles, soft music and close your eyes - sooo relaxing!!!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect that will give you any special relieve on sore muscle.  </li>
      <li>This is tons better than most of the american bath salts.</li>
      <li>Also, the smell is pretty fantastic - and it hangs on your skin for awhile after too.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much !</li>
      <li>Definitely recommend , fast delivery, nice product!</li>
      <li>I was getting way too hot!</li>
      <li>fantastic scent...and very soothing to the skin and muscles</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells like blueberry candy (to me) and makes the water a nice, muddy blue.</li>
      <li>Not only does it smell nice</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an extremely lovely smell-- not too feminine nor masculine.  </li>
      <li>Use them now regularly for a warm evening bath.</li>
      <li>And have been loving them ever since I&#x27;ve been back home!</li>
      <li>I love all their products, but you can beat the Muddy Blue...great color, great fragrance, and all around a million times more relaxing (and less mess) than a bubble bath.</li>
      <li>For someone who knows Japan very well, this is very authentic and next to Godliness when it comes to salt bath products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Highly recommended if you have sore muscles or enjoy soaking in the tub.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, and makes the water smell wonderful and turn a lovely muddy blue color.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps three times or more than we regularly do.</li>
      <li>First off, this stuff holds in heat.</li>
      <li>I first got hooked on these bath salts while in Japan...  </li>
      <li>I love this bath salt that I had to order a second canister.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells pleasant, but I think it&#x27;s a little more feminine than the other reviewer.</li>
      <li>In a really hot bath... you are going to feel like a new person!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered these salts in both Blue and White, and I love them both!</li>
      <li>I felt like I was bathing in industrial cleaner the whole time based on that smell alone.  </li>
      <li>Really like these.</li>
      <li>And reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Your skin is left silky smooth and muscles relaxes.</li>
      <li>whole experience with these bath salts is very relaxing.</li>
      <li>I go through bath salts very quickly, and these have lasted a long time.  </li>
      <li>With its subtitle but peasant aroma, beautiful color and effectiveness on skin and mental therapy, this is a small price to pay for tranquility.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not overly feminine or manly and doesn&#x27;t seem to be aimed at any group in particular.</li>
      <li>It is a great to exfoliate dead skin; after using it a few times, my body felt so much softer!</li>
      <li>am a male, straight, and an avid Amazon shopper because of the comfort and ease online shopping brings with most hard to find products.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Yummy smell and leaves your skin very soft.  </li>
      <li>I will certainly make these a regular buy.</li>
      <li>(Not so much clear, but thicker consistency..</li>
      <li>I was delightfully surprised.</li>
      <li>My wife uses it a lot, and the atmosphere in the house is so changed when she opens the tap into this powder, very addictive really.</li>
      <li>but it softens the bath and makes the water feel soft.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t expect it will give you the similar feeling of the Japanese Hot Spring,</li>
      <li>so I guess it take a little bit more time to see if this bath salt actually relieves back pain.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>I am very surprised how different my opinion is of these &#x27;bath salts&#x27; compared to the majority.  </li>
      <li>, there is nothing feminine or masculine about a salt bath, as mostly everyone in Japan, male and female enjoys the same pleasure daily with very little indifference.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So I will stick with my old aromatherapy salts (that are actually SALTS and not powdered roots, etc.)</li>
      <li>The product smells similar to that residual smell in a restaurant bathroom directly after it has been cleaned.  </li>
      <li>Also the product&#x27;s consistency, color and container&#x27;s dispenser took me back to an old standard when I was a kid - Saniflush.  </li>
      <li>Again, another less than positive bathroom memory.  </li>
      <li>It gives the water a slight silky texture and works fast.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is tons better than most of the american bath salts.</li>
    <li> I love this bath salt that I had to order a second canister.  It&#x27;s an extremely lovely smell-- not too feminine nor masculine.  Just two teaspoons go a long way.  The water isn&#x27;t muddy, but rather gives it a silky-type feeling.  It keeps the heat in longer and my skin afterwards is silky smooth.  Now I&#x27;m always looking forward after a hard day&#x27;s work in soaking with this product.</li>
    <li> I would describe this more as a water softener or calgon type bath accessory than bath salts... it makes the water silky feeling, and blue-white cloudy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells pleasant, but I think it&#x27;s a little more feminine than the other reviewer. That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s overwhelmingly flowery, but it wouldn&#x27;t be something I&#x27;d describe as neutral or masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer bath salts that are more just \\&quot;salts\\&quot; with and without scent... but these were very nice.</li>

    <li> love this bath soak - light candles, soft music and close your eyes - sooo relaxing!!! I buy this product at least every other month and use twice a week!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these salts in both Blue and White, and I love them both! They both smell very pleasant, and the change to the bath color is fun. Even my partner likes the Blue one. I will certainly make these a regular buy.</li>
    <li> This item is my favorite of the Bath Roman series...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like blueberry candy (to me) and makes the water a nice, muddy blue. (Not so much clear, but thicker consistency..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it smell good and look good, it&#x27;s great for your skin!  It is a great to exfoliate dead skin; after using it a few times, my body felt so much softer! It also heats your body up and raises your heart rate, which is good to sweat out all the excess toxins.

    <li> Wow this is one of my new favorite bath products!!! I am so happy I found it. Not only does it smell nice but it softens the bath and makes the water feel soft. Your skin is left silky smooth and muscles relaxes. Highly recommended if you have sore muscles or enjoy soaking in the tub.</li>
    <li> I love all their products, but you can beat the Muddy Blue...great color, great fragrance, and all around a million times more relaxing (and less mess) than a bubble bath.</li>
    <li> I love these!  A little goes a long way, and makes the water smell wonderful and turn a lovely muddy blue color.  I go through bath salts very quickly, and these have lasted a long time.  I&#x27;m a woman and I prefer the green variety, but my male partner likes these and feels that they smell \\&quot;masculine,\\&quot; so they may be an option for a dude who loves bath salts and doesn&#x27;t want to smell like a vanilla factory.</li>
    <li> Yummy smell and leaves your skin very soft.  Don&#x27;t expect to be able to read the ingredients though.  The wording on the can is written in Japanese!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect that will give you any special relieve on sore muscle.  Cause it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t expect it will give you the similar feeling of the Japanese Hot Spring, cause it&#x27;s no way to be any close to that.&lt;br /&gt;Only advantage is, the container is big, and last quit for a while.&lt;br /&gt;If you have nothing to add to your bath, and you bath regularly, it&#x27;s a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;But it won&#x27;t be a choice for me to use when enjoying my bath.</li>
    <li> The fragrance to me is a more unisex smell. It&#x27;s not overly feminine or manly and doesn&#x27;t seem to be aimed at any group in particular. I would recommend it to anyone from both adults and children. The smell of the powder reminds me of pez candy with a very small scent of flowers. After it&#x27;s in the water, it smells more like warm flowers then anything else but the scent is not overpowered at all which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole experience with these bath salts is very relaxing. It gives the water a slight silky texture and works fast. My fiance tried it too and was so relaxed that he fell asleep almost immediately after getting out and into bed even though it was just after work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The can is completely in Japanese but it does come with a sticker on it with the ingredients in English. It does not include instructions in English, or at least mine didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I can read in Japanese, the instructions say...&lt;br /&gt;Per 200 liters (52~ gallons) of water, use 15 to 30 grams (1/2 to 1 ounce) of salts. Estimated 21 uses at 30g per use.&lt;br /&gt;If that makes no sense, then just shake a little into the tub and mix it until you have it where you want (30g is a little less then 2 teaspoons). A little bit goes a long way with this!</li>
    <li> I am very surprised how different my opinion is of these &#x27;bath salts&#x27; compared to the majority.  I bought based on the glowing reviews that spoke of amazing scents.  Not my experience at all.  The product smells similar to that residual smell in a restaurant bathroom directly after it has been cleaned.  I felt like I was bathing in industrial cleaner the whole time based on that smell alone.  Also the product&#x27;s consistency, color and container&#x27;s dispenser took me back to an old standard when I was a kid - Saniflush.  Again, another less than positive bathroom memory.  So I will stick with my old aromatherapy salts (that are actually SALTS and not powdered roots, etc.) that leave my home smelling like a spa rather than a chain restaurant bathroom.</li>
    <li> I had no idea what to expect with this product, I just know it came up as &amp;#34;recommended&amp;#34; when I bought my bath-stopper. I was delightfully surprised. First off, this stuff holds in heat. I had to spend less time in the bath than usual cause I was getting way too hot! Also, the smell is pretty fantastic - and it hangs on your skin for awhile after too. It really is a great product and I&#x27;m glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> Really like these. Use them now regularly for a warm evening bath.</li>
    <li> Wonderful salts don&#x27;t need a lot !</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times so I guess it take a little bit more time to see if this bath salt actually relieves back pain.&lt;br /&gt;But the smell is very mild, the look is like dish-washing powder, What we found was that we sweated a lot after the bath. Perhaps three times or more than we regularly do. After that, we slept well.</li>
    <li> well, to start, the can was dented and when I attempted to return it, the email said they would contact the seller. never heard another thing from anyone. I threw away the can and all chalked it up to one bad deal!  ill figure something else out to soak my poor aching feet.</li>
    <li> I first got hooked on these bath salts while in Japan...  And have been loving them ever since I&#x27;ve been back home!</li>
    <li> While living in Japan, my wife discovered the Japanese Bath Salts - and loves them. They make great Christmas, birthday, valentine gifts. Glad I found them here. And reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I don&#x27;t know what the aroma is but it is really wonderful.  My wife uses it a lot, and the atmosphere in the house is so changed when she opens the tap into this powder, very addictive really.</li>
    <li> For someone who knows Japan very well, this is very authentic and next to Godliness when it comes to salt bath products.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mean to over praise, but Japanese products are some of the finest in the world, and to share a small piece is a rarity for most.&lt;br /&gt;Most people cannot fully enjoy most things as they were meant to be, but perhaps this is not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I feel anyone can have a pleasant experience by trying this salt bath. With its subtitle but peasant aroma, beautiful color and effectiveness on skin and mental therapy, this is a small price to pay for tranquility.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased multiple cans, and would never purchase another product if I were another person. Because I would always want the best for myself, and this is it.&lt;br /&gt;Although a different experience than most are used to, most will find it not difficult to encapsulate themselves into the different subtitles this brings.&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is nothing feminine or masculine about a salt bath, as mostly everyone in Japan, male and female enjoys the same pleasure daily with very little indifference.&lt;br /&gt;So I hope most can relax, enjoy and feel comfortable about taking on this new and wonderful experience by reading this review.&lt;br /&gt;I am a male, straight, and an avid Amazon shopper because of the comfort and ease online shopping brings with most hard to find products.&lt;br /&gt;Recently felt the need to write reviews for outstanding products I never got around to thanking. This is one of them. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Great soothing bath salts.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  In a really hot bath... you are going to feel like a new person!</li>
    <li> fantastic scent...and very soothing to the skin and muscles</li>
