      <li>(I am sure that worrying about losing my hair did not help the \\&quot;losing the hair\\&quot; situation.</li>
      <li>Why do these reviews require so many words?</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and need a good conditioner w a good slip so hair can be detangled easily...</li>
      <li>This conditioner is just OK, and as such is incredibly overpriced.  </li>
      <li>Great conditioner for my curly hair and love the smell need the shampoo to get the total effect of the product.</li>
      <li>Actually product is great but the pump broke upon arrival, I had to find one around my house.</li>
      <li>Works great on my coarse bleached hair.</li>
      <li>I am going to buy the huge 32oz size pretty soon :)</li>
      <li>It is rich and creamy and not oily.</li>
      <li>Great product for my curly, dry hair.</li>
      <li>The ingredients in this product, that is labeled moisture repair special edition, are (found this on the web):  Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, PPG-3, Benzyl Ether Myristate, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Octyldodecyl Ricinoleate, Behentrimonium, Methosulfate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Keratin Amino Acids, Cinnamidopropyltrimonium Chloride, Argania Spinosa Kernal Oil, Amodimethicone, Pantherol, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Divinyldimethicone/Dimethicone Copolymer, Polyquaternium-55, Polyquaternium-37, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG-1, Trideceth-6, C12-13 Pareth-7,</li>
      <li>Now, I have to take the top off each use and always end up pouring out too much</li>
      <li>I have been using this conditioner for about 3 years and have loved what it does for my hair and the smell is terrific.  </li>
      <li>good for hair that splits and gets dry at the ends</li>
      <li>but I believe worth it.</li>
      <li>I am certain of it!</li>
      <li>My son is 3 years old and for the first time, he told me the other day that my hair smelt nice :) I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
      <li>The pump is not actually broken in pieces but it doesn&#x27;t stay in the bottle and when you pump it to get product the conditoner comes out also through the sides.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel like this is the real deal.</li>
      <li>i would highly recommend  it!</li>
      <li>very hydrating, detangles</li>
      <li>Outstanding conditioner with out making the hair feel greasy or wait the hair down.</li>
      <li>With the Moroccan line, you can smell it all day long, even into the next day :)</li>
      <li>I use this conditioner all the time and this one smelled much more of alcohol and dried my hair out a lot.</li>
      <li>I like it, it doesn&#x27;t weight my fine hair down.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve used the larger bottle with the convenience of the pump.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally wavy and thin, and I have not had any frizz and my hair feels amazing.</li>
      <li>Overall this is typically a great product however the seller gave me a FAKE.</li>
      <li>I get compliments on my hair frequently.  </li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>Like the M.O. Shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t take much to use and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I typically blow dry my hair every day to keep it frizz free, but since I began using the Moroccan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
      <li>The biggest disappointment was the pump falling off the minute I got in the shower upon first use and not being able to fix it.  </li>
      <li>As an african american female I was very distressed at the prospect of having alopecia or something.</li>
      <li>The top pump part was broken</li>
      <li>I was experienceing hair loss at an extraordinary rate (as I usually do in the winter months).</li>

<li> A Poor quality conditioner with a false label - a cheap, fake version of the original MoroccanOil Conditioner (which I like very much).</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had to blow dry my hair</li>
<li> I bought this moisturizer and used it every single time I conditioned my hair.  </li>
<li> It is not the same as the previous bottle I had</li>

<li> Only need a little bit.</li>

<li> I thought the Moroccan oil in the shampoo and conditioner would weigh my hair down and make it thinner, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> It does not weigh down my hair either.</li>
<li> and I can get conditioner for much less.</li>
<li> although it is a little pricey--this conditioner was recommended to me by my hairdresser, and seems to be making my hair feel softer</li>
<li> A little pricy for the size, but that is a guy perspective...</li>
<li> so it dried my hair</li>
<li> Doesnt make your hair heavy and the smell lasts for days!</li>
<li> On my my thin hair, and my daughter&#x27;s thick hair....</li>
<li> i notice the pump was broken.  </li>
<li> Pump is broken.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m addicted to the smell...</li>
<li> I bought the conditioner and shampoo - and am very disgusted at being deceived - and paying a high price for an inferior product.</li>

    <li> I love this conditioner. It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve used the larger bottle with the convenience of the pump. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> The description of the product is now updated. When I bought the product it said the bottle capacity was 33.5 oz, but I received a 16oz bottle. The company refused to send me a 33.5oz bottle and said that the wrong link was Amazon&#x27;s responsibility. The only solution was to return the bottle. That cost me $8.89. Avenue reimbursed me only the price of the bottle $37.00. I had to e-mail them again asking for the other $5.00. Finally they reimbursed me this amount too. Now Amazon is telling me they are going to apply a credit of $8.89 in my next order for items sold by them. Will see.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this brand conditioner. You get what u pay for. Doesnt make your hair heavy and the smell lasts for days!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife...home run fellas.  A little pricy for the size, but that is a guy perspective...I have been assurred its a good price by comparison!</li>
    <li> I love this product unfortunately it arrived with the pump broken off</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good conditioner; however I have to use quite a bit in order to comb through my hair well.  The biggest disappointment was the pump falling off the minute I got in the shower upon first use and not being able to fix it.  Now, I have to take the top off each use and always end up pouring out too much which is a hassle.  For the price, the packaging should be much better quality!</li>

    <li> Really great conditioner. Like the M.O. Shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t take much to use and lasts a long time. Hair feels great, totally easy to deal with after showering. All the Morrocan Oil products are excellent!</li>
    <li> I like it, it doesn&#x27;t weight my fine hair down. Only need a little bit. Doesn&#x27;t build up to a nasty gray, my hair stays the same color.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best conditioner I have ever tried. I typically blow dry my hair every day to keep it frizz free, but since I began using the Moroccan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner I haven&#x27;t had to blow dry my hair and I am loving it. My hair is naturally wavy and thin, and I have not had any frizz and my hair feels amazing. I thought the Moroccan oil in the shampoo and conditioner would weigh my hair down and make it thinner, but it doesn&#x27;t. I love, love it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I absolutely love about this line is the smell. The smell is amazing. My son is 3 years old and for the first time, he told me the other day that my hair smelt nice :) I was pleasantly surprised. I love that I can smell the shampoo and conditioner even after my hair dries. Some shampoos and conditioners smells great in the shower, but after your hair dries, you can&#x27;t smell the lovely scent. With the Moroccan line, you can smell it all day long, even into the next day :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love it. I am going to buy the huge 32oz size pretty soon :)</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer and used it every single time I conditioned my hair.  I was experienceing hair loss at an extraordinary rate (as I usually do in the winter months). As an african american female I was very distressed at the prospect of having alopecia or something. (I am sure that worrying about losing my hair did not help the \\&quot;losing the hair\\&quot; situation. Anyway, I bought and used it every time I washed my hair (which was about 4 times in 2 months). As an african american I wash my hair every 2 weeks. If I am working out- every week. The MoroccanOil is a great moisturizer. It is rich and creamy and not oily. It does not weigh down my hair either. It assisted in decreasing my hair loss. I am certain of it! It is pricey but I believe worth it.</li>
    <li> Actually product is great but the pump broke upon arrival, I had to find one around my house.</li>
    <li> Best price I have seen</li>
    <li> A Poor quality conditioner with a false label - a cheap, fake version of the original MoroccanOil Conditioner (which I like very much). I bought the conditioner and shampoo - and am very disgusted at being deceived - and paying a high price for an inferior product. Buyer Beware!</li>
    <li> Not the same as the Moroccan conditioner fromUSA.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner for my curly hair and love the smell need the shampoo to get the total effect of the product.</li>
    <li> Product came packaged well.  The pump was covered by a plastic wrap and as soon as I open it i notice the pump was broken.  The pump is not actually broken in pieces but it doesn&#x27;t stay in the bottle and when you pump it to get product the conditoner comes out also through the sides.  It looks like a manufacture problem and i wonder if the seller got these products at some discount store because they were defective.&lt;br /&gt;When i used the conditioner I feel it doesn&#x27;t work on my hair as the rinse i got at the salon.  Same smell, color and texture but does not feel the same in the hair while your are applying it and after you rinse it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know it had alcohol in it so it dried my hair really bad I had to load on my best leave in conditioner just to brush it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this is the real deal. I use this conditioner all the time and this one smelled much more of alcohol and dried my hair out a lot.</li>
    <li> Outstanding conditioner with out making the hair feel greasy or wait the hair down. Have enjoyed this product line . Been using it for over a year now.</li>
    <li> Smells okay. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll purchase again but I like their oil for blow drying!</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner, love the way it smells.  I get compliments on my hair frequently.  Why do these reviews require so many words?</li>
    <li> good stuff!  although it is a little pricey--this conditioner was recommended to me by my hairdresser, and seems to be making my hair feel softer the more i use it!  i would highly recommend  it!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to so many things that I was reluctant to try this. It is amazing. My hair is so soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! On my my thin hair, and my daughter&#x27;s thick hair....I&#x27;m addicted to the smell...just hate the $$. To EXPENSIVE!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and need a good conditioner w a good slip so hair can be detangled easily...this conditioner does it!</li>
    <li> Works great on my coarse bleached hair.</li>
    <li> Best Conditioner!! Again, this product has improved my hair. I don&#x27;t need alot of product to style it. Helps with frizz!!</li>
    <li> The top pump part was broken so I had to find another bottle to put the product in.</li>
    <li> I ordered this online because the price is so much better than in a salon. Great product for over treated hair. I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
    <li> Great product for my curly, dry hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE Moroccan Oil products</li>
    <li> amazing product.  works better than anything i have ever used before</li>
    <li> I have very dry curly, colored hair. This product is about the best conditioner I&#x27;ve found to help with the dryness. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> great product. great for all hair types. good for hair that splits and gets dry at the ends</li>
    <li> very hydrating, detangles well, i like the smell of it too</li>
    <li> The best conditioner I have ever used.  Very expensive but it makes my hair feel great. Started to use on my daughter&#x27;s because of all the swimming she does and it helps if from drying out from the chlorine. Awesome and will but again. May try to find it cheaper in mn.</li>
    <li> Overall this is typically a great product however the seller gave me a FAKE. I have been using this conditioner for about 3 years and have loved what it does for my hair and the smell is terrific.  When I received this conditioner from the seller, I immediately could tell that the smell was not the same and the texture of the conditioner was off.  I will NOT be purchasing this conditioner from Amazon again, sadly to say, as I have been an Amazon customer for 10 years.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t buy it again.  no difference in my damaged hair and I can get conditioner for much less.</li>
    <li> Great product, worth the $</li>
    <li> Arrived with cap in 2 parts.  Pump is broken.</li>
