<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Hand sanitizer and moisturizer in one. Hands are no longer dry from using other sanitizers that are alcohol based.</li>
    <li> The best hand sanitizer on the market. Does not dry your hands. It has a light scent so my husband uses it too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for work!&lt;br /&gt;It kills germs and isn&#x27;t rough on my hands!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so PERFECT for me!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of hand sanitizer throughout the day. By the end of the day my hands are so dry and cracked in some areas. When I use Gold Bond Ultimate Hand Sanitizer.... I know my hands are cleaned and well as so soft from the moisturizer in it.</li>
    <li> I am really tired of having my hands get dry and cracked from using so much regular hand sanitizer.  This stuff is great.  Works well and goes on like a hand lotion.  The skin on my hands is much better now.  I don&#x27;t worry about wrecking my hands at the same time I kill the germs I might I have picked up from things like shopping carts for example.  Some people think the smell is too strong but I like it.  I gave a tube to a friend and she liked the smell too.  So, I guess it&#x27;s a matter of opinion.  Good stuff.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> like this because it contains a lotion along with a sanitizer, hich is not so drying on skin.</li>
    <li> The only hand cleaner we carry.  Like the smaller size better because it fits in the pocket.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. The cream is perfect for daily use and carrying in my purse and i like the fact that it doubles as a hand sanitizer.</li>
    <li> Good product...l love the combination of sanitizer and moisturizer</li>
    <li> I am on my 6th + tube!  Everyone always asks me where I found this product;  I cannot find it at any store locally.  I use this several times a day;  the smell is fresh and pleasant, doesn&#x27;t smell like the other alcohol type products.  It is a lotion as well as a sanitizer so it easy on the skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff had the longest lasting moisturizing qualities I&#x27;ve found. I use it on a dry spot on my hand. Have tried lots of others. Plus it&#x27;s a sanitizer to boot!</li>
    <li> Small right size for your purse. A great product to have especially if you havebchildren or if youbwork handling cash or work with the public.</li>
    <li> Keeps away the germs while making skin soft.  Great stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years, and have now given away two of my tubes.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hands feeling 100% better than alcohol-based sanitizers!</li>
    <li> I cannot use the gel hand sanitizers. This product is feels good, and works great. I highly recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> Great, but hard to find product.  I get tired of using drying sanitizers then having to track down a hand lotion - now, I have both.  I also supply my mother with this product.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and regular alcohol gel hand sanitizers give me contact dermatitis on my hands. This is the BEST- very moisturizing, but absorbs quickly, not greasy or sticky. I am also very picky about scents (yes, more allergies) but this smells very fresh and clean. If this is ever discontinued, I am in big trouble!</li>
    <li> This is the best hand sanitizer on the market today, because there is no alcohol in it. I have given some to friends and they like it too. Great product Gold Bond.</li>
    <li> Just kidding, I buy this product because it has an ingredient that the regular hand sanitizer does not. Regular hand sanitizer does not kill the noro-virus which is pretty common in fast food restaurants and will spread like a wild fire if you are in a closed environment like a cruise ship.  What is super nice about this stuff is that it will not dry out your hands like the alcohol based products. It does take a little longer to work into your skin. Use sparingly until you figure out what is right for you. I do not care for the regular Gold Bond lotion and this has a completely different feel to it. Not so heavy and greasy. Also, comes in a size that is compatible with tsa restrictions.  I keep a tube in my carry-on bag at all times.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  Wonderful product for hands that break down so easily. The stores her in my town didn&#x27;t know what they had and discontuned it. Thanks to Amazon, I can order it on line.</li>
    <li> Hands feel so much better with this product than with the alcohol variety.  Moisture is great.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! Smells really good, moisturizes as it sanitizes, no stinging sensation as in most hand sanitziers - what could be better?</li>
    <li> I wash my hands a lot due to my job. This really helps.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It sanitizes and feels like hand lotion and keeps your hands soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a germaphobe who rides the subway. As much as I hate to do it, it is often necessary to hold onto that nasty metal pole. I used to rely on your standard alcohol based hand sanitizers to degrosify at the end of my daily commute, but these would dry my hands out horribly. Enter gold bond hand sanitizer and no more dry bleeding hands. A little tube lasts months as you only need a little bit to cover your hands. Other reviewers don&#x27;t like the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> My favorite when traleling</li>
    <li> I put this in the glove compartment of my car.&lt;br /&gt;Hands and fingers will not get so dry.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it kills some germs ... better than using&lt;br /&gt;alcohol based gel that is less efficent.&lt;br /&gt;Paramedic 27 years.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. Does not dry out your hands.</li>
    <li> You MUST buy this for yourself. It not only moisturizes but also sanitizes? I don&#x27;t leave home without it. Ever.</li>
    <li> It was very greasy, used it before entering a cruise dinning room and the silverware kept slipping thru my fingers.  But using less helped, and it was much better on my hands than the alcohol bases sanitizer the cruise line provided.  So will probably use again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sanitizer because it does not dry out your skin like alcohol based ones.  It sells out in the stores and is very hard to find.</li>
    <li> Wanted this product BUT - arrived with one cap missing and two caps smashed / crushed - most the lotion all over the bag it came it.??  really??</li>
    <li> Silky smooth, not greasy, and no odor. Your hands will feel smoother after using it!  Keep in purse, briefcase, and car.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It&#x27;s the only lotion the prevents cracking in the winter</li>
    <li> Works very good. Use after I take care of my dogs. Hands don&#x27;t feel dry after using it, no more dry hands.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Goes on feeling like it is going to be oily or sticky but that feeling is gone immediately when you stop rubbing your hands.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great combination--don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;medicine-type&amp;#34; smell of regular hand sanitizers, but not greasy like some lotions either!  Very handy--we keep them in all vehicles and bags!</li>
    <li> Great hand cream with the added benefit of being a hand sanitizer.  My wife uses this at her work as an ER nurse in the hospital.</li>
    <li> I work as a cashier at a casino. Not only is money dirty and germ filled, it dries out your hands. Gold Bond is great hand cream but the added sanitizer makes it a must have!</li>
    <li> Great sanitizer to have on hand if you don&#x27;t want the strong awful smell of the alcohol based gels, AND is your hands tend to dry out. Non greasy but not drying either, feels skin soft not sticky! The blue kind has very little scent which is why we buy it. The citrus one is not very good and runnier in our experience.</li>
    <li> Love this product. The moisturizer with the hand sanitizer softens your hands. It is not harmful to your nails like regular sanitizer.</li>
    <li> I got a travel sized one of these a few years back and finally got around to buying a bulk pack of them.  I can&#x27;t believe how difficult this product is to find in stores, because it is an absolute essential in the winter time.  It has all the disinfecting, germ-killing capabilities of traditional hand sanitizer, while actually moisturizing your hands rather than drying them out.  This is one of my favorite personal care items, as it kills 2 birds with one stone.</li>
    <li> I keep one of these in my desk and bag. You can&#x27;t  always wash your hands so I use this in a bind. Hand sanitizer can be drying so this a good alternative to keep hands from drying out.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I keep tubes of it everywhere -- in the car, on the desk, around the house... it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t destroy your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tough to find at any retailer around me, but of course Amazon&#x27;s got it!</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I use.  I love that it has hand sanitizer, but feels like lotion.  And true to Gold Bond brand, its great lotion - creamy but not too greasy.</li>
    <li> Smells great and it really moisturizes.  Starts off a little oily when you first put it on but that only lasts for less than a minute.  I can never find these in my local stores.  Glad Amazon has it.</li>
    <li> This has been great to throw in my son&#x27;s diaper bag, my purse, and in the car.  I use it all the time after I change a diaper when I&#x27;m out but don&#x27;t have access to a sink.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands like the gels do.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to the gel hand sanitizers; this one has moisturizer.  Nice!</li>
    <li> I will preface this by saying that I hate the traditional hand sanitizers (smell &amp; feel) - this product leaves your hands moisturized and sanitized without a heavy scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> My husband cannot use a gel hand sanitizer. He likes this. It is a good size for in the car.</li>
    <li> The best hand santizer.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS HARD TO FIND IN RETAIL PRODUCT!  DONT WANT TO USE ANYTHING ELSE</li>
    <li> Great Sanitizer Moisturizer without alcohol drying effects</li>
    <li> Gold Bond Hand Sanitizer DOES NOT dry out your skin like most sanitizers. Hands are clean as well as soft.</li>
    <li> Does not dry hands when cleaning them</li>
    <li> The best sanitizer and moisturizer in the industry. I will continue to buy this product as long as it is made</li>
    <li> It was only 3 not 6 in the shipment.  Love the product, wanted more.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and great product.</li>
    <li> I wash &amp; sanitize my hands a lot &amp; they were cracking and bleeding @ the knuckles. After using this instead of alcohol based sanitizers, my hands have no cracks and barely look dry!</li>
    <li> I am impressed by this product.  It literally feels like you are putting on hand cream, to the point where I am not sure I believe that my hands are getting clean - haha!  We are all used to the stinky, alcohol based cleaners.  I&#x27;m happy to use it though - and carry it in my diaper bag.  I think it will come in so handy this winter and keep my skin looking moisturized.</li>
    <li> I had tried this and then could not find in a store.  It is great to keep in purse or car.  I like to use after I get gas.</li>
    <li> Reviews sold me on this product, but after using it I have found it to be very greasy and it has a very strong scent - even if you use just a little amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried giving it away to friends but they all agree, it smells too much, and none of them will take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigh.</li>
    <li> I work in the health care field and wash or sanitize my hands dozens of times a day.  The alcohol-based sanitizers were killing my hands and causing my nails to crack.  I started using the Gold Bond and things are much better.  I keep it in the pocket of my coat while at work.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Moisturizer helps to alleviate potential dry skin from the sanitizing agents. Size is convenient for carrying.</li>
    <li> An excellent product for people who need to use sanitizers frequently, like teachers.</li>
    <li> Great price on 6 pack purse size.  Good for when you&#x27;re out shopping, getting ready to grab a burger....whatever.  It has been proven. Bacterial transfer is in need of prevention.  And this keeps your hands nice too.</li>
    <li> james bond?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gold bond!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;better than bleach, better for your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;going on a cruise?  wear gloves, buy this, don&#x27;t get the NORO</li>
    <li> The other alcohol based ones just kept drying our hands to cracking pain.  However this Gold Bond is like using lotion and it a great in the winter, but also use it in the summer.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter has allergies and often it affects her hands giving her open sores.  The alcohol in most hand sanitizers really hurt when you have an open cut or sore but Gold Bond does not contain alcohol so it does not hurt.  My husband has problems in the winter with rough, dry hands and open sores also, so he first brought my attention to Gold Bond hand sanitizer and moisturizer.  I first bought some in a store close by but was not able to find any anywhere this year so I looked on Amazon.com.  Of course Amazon has it; they have everything and at a better price than you can find anywhere.  I bought a package containing six individual containers so I can keep some and give my granddaughter some.  Thank you Amazon.com and Gold Bond.</li>
    <li> I probably just jinxed myself. My boyfriend, who swears by this product, gave me a tube of it before I flew out for a business trip last September. I always got sick after trips but not that one and I think this was part of the reason. It&#x27;s a little tiny bit greasy so I just work it into the skin real well and after a few minutes, it&#x27;s fine. I don&#x27;t mind the scent and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really strong enough to bother other people the way scented lotions from like Bath and Body Works can (I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to the point strong scents will give me a headache). I have one in my purse, another at my desk, even gave one to a co-worker after she complained about chapped hands and getting sick. She said she liked it very much as well. Despite how cold this winter has been, my hands are pretty smooth where in the past I would get red, cracked patches that no amount of lotion would get rid of. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> My hands are dry and cracked and I&#x27;m in healthcare so I use sanitizer several times each day.  This is my cure! I&#x27;m so&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the results:)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff..  you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it.  I have sensitive skin and industrial soaps irritate my skin.  I carry this with me, keep it in my office ... I try to always have some with me.</li>
    <li> Great Product..keep a tube of this in all my cars and when traveling.</li>
    <li> This great Gold Bond Ultimate Sanitizer and Moisturizer has saved my hands this winter!  I&#x27;ll use it in the summer, too.  Added bonus . . . Amazon delivered the package of 12 several days before I was expecting it!  You can&#x27;t beat a deal like that!</li>
    <li> Great to keep from getting dry hands with other sanitizers</li>
    <li> Great for when we are out in the country in our Jeep.  Have used this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> If you want to use sanitizer but don&#x27;t want your hands to dry out, this is the product for you. The lotion part keeps your hands moist while also killing 99.9% of germs. I wish they sold this in stores but for some reason stores stopped selling it. :(</li>
    <li> Most of all because it does not dry the hands like other sanitizer. I only wish it weren&#x27;t so difficult to get. I have already shared some tubes with my friends.</li>
    <li> Most of these products are too drying.  Not this one with lotion!  Mild scent as well - not too strong.</li>
    <li> With my baby in the NICU, my hands were torn apart. I asked the doctor about non-alcohol based sanitizer and she told me this was the only one approved by the hospital. What a Godsend for the frequent diaper changes and other germ killing situations. Now that the baby is home, we have a full size one on our changing table, one in the bathroom, one in our room, and one in the kitchen. We have 2 older boys (3 and 2) and it is safe for them to use with supervision. Excellent product! We have been using these travel size ones for a few months and they are not empty yet. Great for the diaper bag and to keep one in my purse!</li>
    <li> What  I like about this is that it doesn&#x27;t dry my hands and it&#x27;s fragrance-free.  No alcohol.  I carry it with me in the car, to meetings, etc.</li>
    <li> As the title indicates, I suffer from dishidrotic excema and my hands tend to peel and blister up a bit. This makes an alcohol based hand sanitizer not only a painful option, but something that exacerbates my condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a sample of this, and was bummed to discover that it wasn&#x27;t easy to find. I thought they stopped making it. Luckily I got a six pack on Amazon!! YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can keep a tube in all the convenient places (Work, car, purse, desk etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is about as strong as the Healing with Aloe lotion. It almost smells identical. It&#x27;s much more subtle than alcohol based sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the hand cream, it does leave a protective layer on the hands, which I like, but others may find troublesome.</li>
    <li> I wish I could find this in the stores</li>
    <li> Great sanitizer with a moisturizer.  This really works.</li>
    <li> has no alcohol leave on the door of my car so each time I get in I use.</li>
    <li> Outstanding! Moisturizing and sanitizes your hands. Your hands don&#x27;t dry out</li>
    <li> This is a great product for both sanitizing a persons hand without the problem of drying out the hands.  This will help reduce sore hands and still protect a person in the public.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product to put in my purse.  I use it after handling the menu because that is one of the dirtiest things out there.  Also use it after shaking hands at church.  Wasn&#x27;t sick once during the winter.  Sorry the stores stopped carrying it.</li>
    <li> The best sanitizer, period! It doesn&#x27;t dry up your hands, but moisturizes them instead. To top it off, it smells really nice.</li>
    <li> I love not having my skin burn to the alcohol in the regular gel types.  I have sensitive skin and works very well.</li>
    <li> As expected. Wish it were still available in stores.</li>
    <li> A perfect companion to liquid sanitizers that often dry your hands.  Using this on a regular basis, at night, does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
    <li> Great purchase at a great price!</li>
    <li> This sanitizer is the best, no bleach, no alcohol, no dry cracked hands, no burning just a very nice moisturizing lotion with a faint pleasant smell. We carry it with us everywhere and pass it to our friends at the table when we are camping, kayaking or any time soap and water are not handy. We always get the same great response, Great Stuff!</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Used to have a smaller tube that was more convenient to carry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sanitizer since it hit the market in full size pumps with a purse size included. It&#x27;s the only sanitizer I&#x27;ve ever been able to use for my extremely sensitive skin. That&#x27;s saying a lot because I&#x27;ve tried all the others. This has absolutely no greasy feeling upon application. Greatest moisturizer ever!</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Have people fighting to use mine at work.</li>
    <li> this moisturizes as well as all the gold bond products and lasts a long time.  i have to take their word on it being a hand sanitizer but I don&#x27;t have a problem with infections or colds so I&#x27;m happy.  it&#x27;s not oily or smelly or anything else negative.  it&#x27;s just right!</li>
    <li> great stuff makes hands feet creamy</li>
    <li> Its alittle sticky, but not bad.</li>
    <li> I use this product often and cannot find it in local stores.  When I visit NJ I usually buy as many as I can so I was pleased to find it on your website and the price wasnt to bad.</li>
    <li> Moisturizer absorbs quickly, and the active ingredient is effective against viruses.</li>
    <li> I can not get over how great this moisturizer is and the fact that it sanitizes too is truly  amazing! I love giving these to friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never seen it before and came across it when I was searching for hand santizer on Amazon.  I read the reviews of some people thought it smelled terrible, but I took a chance as I use Gold Bond moisturizer on a regular basis.  I have no idea what those that said it smelled terrible are talking about - it&#x27;s just not true.  If anyone has ever used Gold Bond moisturizer it smells exactly the same and the scent does not linger.  I love using this instead of traditional hand sanitizer because I work in retail and am constantly using hand santizer while working.  Don&#x27;t ask, but unless you work retail you just don&#x27;t realize how dirty money and credit cards are - ugh!  I have very dry skin and this stuff keeps my hands nice and soft.  This product is a little thinner than regular gold bond, but it is still nice and silky and aborbs very quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this product..</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic.  I used to use Aveeno, but since I discovered this, it&#x27;s all I use.  It isn&#x27;t cheap, but I like the fact it has sanitizer in it. I wouldn&#x27;t call myself a germ-phobe, but I do try to be careful, especially in flu/cold season.  I believe this stuff probably helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having issues with my skin cracking from frequent hand washing and frequent use of alcohol-based sanitizers.  I knew there had to be a better solution, and this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can read about the active ingredient online...seems to be very effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria and other pathogens.  And this product has the maximum amount allowable by FDA of the active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels great too.  My skin cracks healed in 1.5 days using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (10/04/2015):  Well, I&#x27;ve been successfully using this product for almost 3 years now.  I didn&#x27;t mention in my original review that my health requires a medication which powerfully suppresses my immune system.  With this in mind, I am very cautious and diligent about pathogens - especially when in public.  This Gold Bond product has helped me be very successful in this regard.  I can apply it and walk into a doctor&#x27;s office waiting room or drugstore or other areas where I know pathogens abound - and walk into those places with a good deal of confidence that I&#x27;m protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that this product can provide up to 4 hours of protection.  After using many, many tubes, I believe this is very likely.  I&#x27;ve also read where EMTs and other practitioners are using this (or competing products with the same active ingredient) on their hands under their gloves - as a second line of defense in case there is a perforation in a glove.  Sounds like a good and prudent practice to me.</li>
    <li> Great product for people with sensitive skin. Small enough to send with the kids to school or keep in your briefcase.</li>
    <li> We have used the Gold Bond for several years which is a &amp;#34;excellent hand cream and sanitizer&amp;#34; which we keep one in all of our vehicles.  It is great to use after any shopping excursion!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great!  I carry it with me all the time. You get the benefits of lotion and hand sanitizer all in one. You don&#x27;t always have access to soap and water to wash, so this helps with killing the germs.</li>
