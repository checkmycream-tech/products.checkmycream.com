<li> Can sting your face when you spray directly onto it and has a slight stink.</li>
<li> I used the one I purchased from Artesian Tan and its awful.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a life changer for my red headed pale self.</li>
<li> This product also lasts so if you mess up and tend to go dark or have spots you will have to learn to accept them for the day unless you plan on scrubbing because it does not leave a lot of room for messing up.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d rather pay a few dollars more and get the product I want then save a few dollars and get whatever this crap is they sold me.</li>
<li> My husband also tried and it was very splotchy, and the worst part was the color which was orange, too much money down the drain for me ,</li>
<li> Been using this for years and for the price you get amazing quality without a nasty smell or orange tint to you...  </li>
<li> However, I learned that it&#x27;s easier to prevent a messy situation when spraying in your bedroom by covering the rug with a towel.</li>
<li> I have really pale skin</li>
<li> It will make a mess but it works well!</li>
<li> It was very hard for me to spray it on evenly.</li>
<li> Not great for all over body but face, chest &amp; arms</li>

    <li> Beautiful, natural color.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunless tanning spray. I&#x27;ve tried several brands and this is one of my faves. Good on evenly, with no streaks, dried quickly with no yucky smell &amp; looks great.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t fine so you have to quickly pat which can cause streaking or blotches. Not great for all over body but face, chest &amp; arms it&#x27;s fine</li>

    <li> Great color that lasts!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly! Loved the color it gave me!  Seemed to last several days too!</li>

    <li> Did not meet my expectations</li>
    <li> The product is the best bronzer self tanner that I have ever used. People ask me if I have been to the beach and are surprised when I tell them it came from a can.</li>
    <li> It was very hard for me to spray it on evenly. My husband also tried and it was very splotchy, and the worst part was the color which was orange, too much money down the drain for me ,</li>

    <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE Amber Sun!!!! I&#x27;ve purchased this product well over a dozen times &amp; the color NEVER disappoints! HIGHLY recommend!Thanks!</li>
    <li> Best i have used, even and long lasting. No odor.</li>
    <li> Sprays on neatly... However, I learned that it&#x27;s easier to prevent a messy situation when spraying in your bedroom by covering the rug with a towel. Otherwise it does stain the carpet! But all and all it&#x27;s a great look when you don&#x27;t like to go out in the sun but want that  realistic tan look. It&#x27;s not orange at all. A truly great product that I&#x27;ve been using now for three summers.</li>
    <li> I was an avid spray tanner back in Florida, then I moved to Roswell, NM where there is little to no access to spray tanning.  And at 25.00 a pop there is noooo way I am paying that as I use to spray up to three times a week back home. Got online, ordered this and almost cried I was so happy.  Goes on evenly (I actually use a mitt to apply and it is easy peasy) and looks amazing!!  Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> i love this tanning spray</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Just be sure to let it dry before getting wet and put in on when extremely dry and don&#x27;t put lotion on.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome spray bronzer! I love that it is a continuous spray no matter what angle its held at. Really good color and smell is not bad at all.</li>
    <li> This spray tan is incredible! A little different color than the Venetian, but perfect for all skin types and absolute beautiful results!</li>
    <li> I will never buy from Artesian Tan again. I have bought this spray tan many times and have NEVER had a problem with it. I used the one I purchased from Artesian Tan and its awful. This is NOT the norvell product that they have labeled it. It doesn&#x27;t even smell the same and whatever this is they sold me made my face feel like it was on fire. I&#x27;d rather pay a few dollars more and get the product I want then save a few dollars and get whatever this crap is they sold me.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite spray tanner , it bronzes you instantly . No streaks and you don&#x27;t end up orange !</li>
    <li> Been using this for years and for the price you get amazing quality without a nasty smell or orange tint to you...  If you are a first time spray tanner this is a product that is easy to see as it goes on.  I would recommend this for everyone</li>
    <li> luv this stuff just don&#x27;t spray a lot on when you first use it</li>
    <li> I get spray tanned every 7-10 days and this product does a nice job of helping me stretch out the sessions (and save$).&lt;br /&gt;Does not look yellow. Great for touch up of areas that lighten more quickly (legs, after shaving, and inside elbows).</li>
    <li> Can sting your face when you spray directly onto it and has a slight stink. Outside of that the color that it produces is great.  I have really pale skin and it&#x27;s hard to get any self tanning to look real, but this product is believable.</li>
