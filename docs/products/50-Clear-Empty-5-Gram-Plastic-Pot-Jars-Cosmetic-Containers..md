<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price.  Nice to find these available in this quantity.</li>
    <li> Wrong size but work great for samples</li>
    <li> way smaller than they appear to be on here. worthless to use for making chapstick.</li>
    <li> Perfect for mini samples</li>
    <li> They are what they say they are.  I actually needed to put face serum samples in some and body wax samples in another, so I tested it, and they appear to be leak proof.  I like that the lids screw on, as opposed to the &amp;#34;paint container&amp;#34; kinds, where the lids pop on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again, just from whatever seller has the best price.  But for the record I got these from Vivaplex.</li>
    <li> Six were cracked, one was missing a lid, smaller than expected.very low quality</li>
    <li> They are just what I expected.</li>
    <li> These do not work well for liquid/gel samples.  They leak, even when reinforced with tape.</li>
    <li> Excited to use these for my sample products!  I will be reordering.</li>
    <li> I made some lip balm and they work perfectly. Minor scratches but nothing alarming.</li>
    <li> Came as described and price was good.  I used these to give samples of lotion out.</li>
    <li> Perfect to make small samples with exactly as described</li>
    <li> Great little jars!  I&#x27;ve been using them for lip balms, but I also plan to make some homemade eye shadows using these.  Very nice packaging, arrived on time and was a clean product!</li>
    <li> Perfect for the samples I needed to make! Will be buying more!</li>
    <li> These were exactly as described and good quality.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for and needed. Using these to make samples of tarts/candles to give out.  Just the right size and quality is great. Arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Some lids are very hard to open.  (defective)</li>
    <li> Love these! I use them for samples of the pain cream I make. Customers get enough to try and love it!</li>
    <li> Great quality plastic. Perfect size for diy balms and such. Plus a great bargain.</li>
    <li> VERY unhappy with this product. I ordered 2, so 100 pot jars. Many of them are cracked. Lots of them the tops won&#x27;t screw on tightly..they just keep turning. So frustrated I ordered from this seller. Poor product.</li>
    <li> A few of the containers are stuck closed (I believe the machine missed the thread alignment when twisting them on) but the rest are exactly what I was looking and hoping for.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. Exactly what I had expected. Will definitely order again</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for face care products to share</li>
    <li> Four of these arrived cracked. And just since filling ten three more cracked. Writing a complaint now. Terrible.</li>
    <li> Quality went WAY down! Had to pick plastic pieces off of every jar and a bunch were cracked and they look very unprofessional. Was happy the multiple times I ordered before but not going to happen again.</li>
    <li> way too small to be of any use as they were broken and cracked and several of the lids did not seal properly. I ended up throwing these away and buying some from Joann Fabrics.</li>
    <li> Great for my beeswax lip balm.  One reminder for everyone using this product DO NOT boil to sterilize, use alcohol instead or you will have a pile of warped plastic.</li>
    <li> 2nd time purchasing a little smaller than the 1st set...other than that great quality for little money.</li>
    <li> I sent these back they look great but were to small.</li>
    <li> Container are just the perfect size for acrylic powder colors!! Great price for how many that you get! Happy with this order :)</li>
    <li> They came fast but a few were broken.</li>
    <li> Got it fast what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Holds just the right amount of stuff for gifts.</li>
    <li> These plastic pots are perfect for what I need them for. Thank you for the prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Excellent twist-top containers for make-up or small items</li>
    <li> Great price and you get what you pay for.  Out of 50 jars only 2 were bad.  I&#x27;ll be ordering again.</li>
    <li> OVERALL A GOOD EXPERIENCE. HOWEVER, HIGH QUALITY IS A STRETCH. A FEW (3) CONTAINERS ARRIVED CRACKED AND SOME LIDS DID NOT SCREW ON STRAIGHT. I HAD 47 USABLE CONTAINERS AND FOR LESS THAN TEN DOLLARS, THAT&#x27;S NOT BAD!</li>
    <li> Good quality, but some lids were cross threaded and difficult to open.</li>
    <li> great for making samples</li>
    <li> I made a very profitable mistake. Ordered the wrong containers, but it was worth it  in the end.</li>
    <li> Perfect for gift giving lip glosses and small first aid salves.  Very useful size!</li>
    <li> wonderful and packages so nice will buy again</li>
    <li> Got here in a timely manner and they were exactly as I was expecting :) very pleased</li>
    <li> These are perfect.  I make and sell jewelry and I can put my jewelry in these then in a pouch.  In my opion they are nicer then a cheap jewelry box.  They are small and I have some earring sets that wont fit.  I wanted them small so the jewelry wouldnt bounce around in shipping.  They have a screw top.  They are not too deep but for me exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> I bought these for lip balm and scrub and they worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Have ordered twice. Love them</li>
    <li> If I could give more than 5 stars I would.  These are quality jars at a great price.  Did not need customer service but I&#x27;m sure it would be great!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to have 3 covers broken and one cover missing. Though the price is great, the quality wouldn&#x27;t take much to improve. ie. better packaging.</li>
    <li> Kind of small, but got the job done. Good price.</li>
    <li> Use this to give my patients the extracted tooth, they always want to preserve them. Great!</li>
    <li> Came on time and was great quality and price</li>
    <li> Got here quick, great product.</li>
    <li> A few bad ones, but OK.  I was disappointed at first... a little hard to open and close well.  On the upside, there sure are a lot of them! :-)</li>
    <li> These little round containers work well for a lip gloss d_i_y activity I did with some youth at my church. only 2 of the 50 containers would not unscrew and open they had been tightened crooked and I could not use them. Other than that I have no complaints and you cannot beat the price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know how small these really were but they worked out perfectly since they were for my kids to make homemade lip gloss. They really didn&#x27;t need anything bigger plus it gave them a reason to do more than one kind for each one of them.</li>
    <li> What a deal!  I bought a jar of Egyptian Magic along with these so I have a never ending supply of high quality lip balm.  Perfect for a lip balm addict like me!</li>
    <li> The delivery was great , on time. Very we&#x27;ll packaged. The product itself was just what I was looking for. This was used for lip balm and creams and for the lady&#x27;s , we&#x27;ll total satisfaction because it fit in any purse. I&#x27;ll be getting more later. Very good product and the price was just right.</li>
    <li> I turned these into geocache containers - check them out here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Should have figured out what 5 grams really was</li>
    <li> These are horrible containers.  They are the most difficult to open, and I am sorry that I ordered them.</li>
    <li> These little jars are my JAM!  I love using these things for samples of my products.  It gives people just enough to make them want more!</li>
    <li> These containers are the perfect size for very small amounts of stuff, in my case I use them for beads.</li>
    <li> Tiny little containers, perfect for purse-sized ointments and balms. The screw lids are secure, although I don&#x27;t know if they would keep liquids from leaking (I didn&#x27;t test that). Pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Just the right size for a little pot of lip balm.</li>
    <li> Perfect for samples! These are about the size of a nickle. I use them for beauty samples and BHO storage/sale. These are the perfect size and not too big! I also like the price!</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed</li>
    <li> perfect just what I needed!</li>
    <li> These worked perfectly for my lip scrubs.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed them for! Great price!</li>
    <li> SATISFIED EVERY TIME WE ORDER! WE ARE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE REPEAT CUSTOMERS!</li>
    <li> Hard to twist lids on</li>
    <li> Many uses for these.  Great for made at home lip balm</li>
    <li> Great product, just a little too small for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with these little sample jars. They seem to seal well, even for liquids which I wasn&#x27;t sure about. They hold slightly more than 5ml and are perfect for my home made lip balm and salves</li>
    <li> They may be 5 gram containers, but they&#x27;re different from the same 5 gram containers I&#x27;d ordered and rec&#x27;d previously.  The first ones were taller than these and worked better for my needs.  I still haven&#x27;t used all of the containers yet b/c they&#x27;re just a royal pain.  A lot of the lids don&#x27;t screw on securely...I can sit and turn it all day long and it just never is secured.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in these containers and won&#x27;t purchase them from this company again!</li>
    <li> Shipping and product as expected</li>
    <li> None of them were broken like the last time I bought, I was really happy about that. But some of them, the caps didn&#x27;t want to close all the way and on others the caps were way too loose. I had to switch out and mix and match caps, which was super annoying and some of them didn&#x27;t want to open either. I will be looking into another company for my sample container needs. These were way too expensive for their quality, beyond disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for my samples.  Good  product and good price. Quick delivery also.</li>
    <li> This was packaged great product works great!!</li>
    <li> The small jars worked perfectly for lip balm and small samples of skin care products! Have recommended them and will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I bought these and they came quickly.  I just opened the box and about 5 or 6 are cracked.  That doesn&#x27;t help me when I am trying to do a big holiday shoppe.</li>
    <li> All containers arrived in perfect condition and can be closed tightly. They are great for short trips to store your lotions, as sample containers for entrepreneurs, or for your handbag to always keep a smaller amount of hand lotion or other things with you. My sixth grade daughter just used them all for samples and gifts for her homemade lotions and could write with sharpie what each container holds. Three of them tied together make a cute little christmas gift for her teachers. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> To cute for lip gloss!</li>
    <li> I bought these to hold homemade shimmer paints and these are the perfect size to mix one container of L.A. Colors mica eye-shadow (http://www.amazon.com/Colors-Eyeshadow-Wearing-Shimmering-Make-up/dp/B00367AM7U/ref&#x3D;sr_1_fkmr0_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1418682088&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2-fkmr0&amp;keywords&#x3D;L.+A.+Colors+loose+eyeshadow+pots) with some Gum Arabic (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003O3X6OW/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) to make my own twinkling watercolors. But - I bought my L.A. Colors at a local dollar store for $1. Shop around for the eye-shadow - if your going to pay $4 or more thenn you may as well go ahead and but the Twinkling H2Os.</li>
    <li> Great value. Quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Perfect for samples but the tops get stuck on will not purchase again</li>
    <li> Packaged just as you see in the photo, so none were broken. Really good quality.</li>
    <li> Some of the lids cannot come off.  The ones that do are great.. but several are duds!</li>
    <li> Good experience I used the m for my loose mineral eye shadow.</li>
    <li> Looks as advertised.  Satisfied. thx.</li>
    <li> This jars were what I was looking for for my Custom Colors lipstick .</li>
    <li> Great product! Met my expectations! Placed a second order &amp; received it within days! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> We are using them for storage of extra pieces that are small for crafts.  Both batches have come to me clear, not marked up, no scratches, with lids not only on, but that fit perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My hubby is using some with metal jewelry making.  For ends, connectors, small findings.  I am using some with clay bead making.  For all my accent stones, highlight dust, pieces I collect for a steampunk look.  It is honestly working amazingly for the steampunk.  I keep all the different looking components in their own containers.  With my accent stones is the other place these containers really shine for me.  They are lined up in a container, I can see through the sides and the top is perfect for a round 1 inch label. So I have size and color of the stone inside.</li>
    <li> Good quality no problems smaller than expected but useful for my needs make sure to note gram size to ensure this is the product you want.</li>
    <li> The value is freakin amazing. Only problem I had was dealing with Amazon&#x27;s incompetent contracted regional carriers who delivered it much later than what I PAID for. Ugh....But great jars. Perfect for putting travel size necessities in your purse.</li>
    <li> I purchased to make homemade lip gloss, the size was perfect and I didn&#x27;t have any issues dealing the containers closed but about 1/4 of the containers didn&#x27;t open or were extremely difficult to open.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my samples</li>
    <li> Perfect for making Perfectly Posh samples!</li>
    <li> Love these! They arrived in perfect condition and were the perfect size! I will definitely reorder these for my Younique makeup samples!</li>
    <li> Smaller then expected but worked wonderfully for what I needed.</li>
    <li> High quality my left buttcheek. Small in size and of subpar quality, I would not purchase these again to hold the viscous fluid that makes babies. This is just wrong. Now i have to purchase from a legitimate seller who takes pride in their product. WishI knew better.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I was looking for I wanted a little bigger but they worked and got the job done.  So really can&#x27;t complain.  They shipped on time as well.  Great experience.</li>
    <li> Just got them today just what i needed thank you . will order again</li>
    <li> These constantly crack. It you are planning to sell any good cosmetic product in it, consider paying more for a less fancy looking thing. Its sad to throw out good product because the container busts. They crack before and after product is in them. both the lid and the base are weak. I have tried them from several suppliers. There is just something flawed in the design. anyone else having this problem?</li>
    <li> These clear capsules were perfect for what I needed.... And the bags were beautiful!  Delivered much quicker than estimated. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I must not have read the size of these tiny jars right because they are TINY!  It&#x27;s my fault though.  I may have to use them for hard bees wax lotion instead of my original idea.  I still need regular size lotion jars though...</li>
    <li> smaller than I thought, but still very nice product</li>
    <li> They worked for what I intended, but I don&#x27;t think i would purchase them again.</li>
    <li> The lids don&#x27;t fit at all, they never tighten. It&#x27;s pretty cheap quality, I can&#x27;t use them for what I was hoping to.</li>
    <li> Came with none broken. I thought it would be a little bigger because of the picture, but in fact it is larger than the actual scale. The only thing I would advise is knowing before hand how big it will be so the product size will not come to you as a surprise.</li>
    <li> No broken ones, all completely perfect. Fast shipping and easy to use.</li>
    <li> they are what the pic shows and they are new and in good quality</li>
    <li> OK these are fine but tiny</li>
    <li> These jars are VERY small. Perfect for pocket-sized lip balms, if you make those. I purchased them to use for samples of my body butters.  However, it would be an extremely small sample.  So, I am going to adjust my plan and use them for samples of my healing creams, instead.  Otherwise, the jars are very well made and pleasing to the eye.</li>
    <li> some of the lids don&#x27;t screw on correctly but you just have to play with them and you will fine a match</li>
    <li> Great product, great delivery and great packaging. Love it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these! perfect size to mail samples for Younique! Fast shipping, great packaging.  These even keep the rose water in them without spilling.  Love them, thank you</li>
    <li> I really like the measurement on these jars. I use them for lotion samples. Sadly, I can&#x27;t use them to sample my body polishes because they will leak. The caps don&#x27;t adjust as tight as I want them. Some of my clients have complain about product leaking from these jars. I am thinking of ordering from another company. They arrived on time though.</li>
    <li> would be good to have a comparative point of the size of this product. Be aware that 5 Gr is small</li>
    <li> Worked great for making lipglosses</li>
    <li> A lot of these were cracked, or they didn&#x27;t screw on tightly enough and I had product every where. Would possibly buy again, but just wouldn&#x27;t put liquids like dish soap or something like that into it.</li>
    <li> Several of them cracked when they were tightened. I bought them for chapstick but I won&#x27;t be using these again.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find thses on line.  I make jewelry and these are great for beads and findings.</li>
    <li> These were perfect and packaged beautifully!</li>
    <li> Adorable and perfect for lip balm or solid perfume.</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for. Product description was correct but some of the lids had cracks in then, there were sharp edges that I had to file off, and some of them don&#x27;t close correctly because the threading isn&#x27;t matched up the right way. Any liquid leaks out and the lids unscrew when moved around too much, but if you&#x27;re just using them for crafts and such, they&#x27;ll work out okay.</li>
    <li> These containers were perfect for the lip scrubs and balms I make. They hold the perfect amount and really cute and easy to fill.</li>
    <li> good quality product, i use them for my lip balm</li>
    <li> I bought these for use with acrylic paints, and after two days the paints started to dry inside these.  Not good.  Don&#x27;t waste your money if you are buying these for paint containers.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my Lush samples! Much better than the Lush ones. My only problem is that 2-3 always have no covers and two always leak. Quality control guys! No one wants a leak in their mail! I don&#x27;t want to pay 20 bucks and have 3 I can&#x27;t use either. -1 star for those reasons. Still better than Lush</li>
    <li> These are smaller than I expected but still good for their intended purpose. I&#x27;m using them for samples of my lip balm.</li>
    <li> Wrong size came. Needed them asap so had to use. Not pleased at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an independent consultant for Perfectly Posh and these work perfectly for me!  But I thought I was also receiving an eyeshadow sample, I didn&#x27;t. That was slightly disappointing, but containers are great so it all works out!</li>
    <li> These work well for keeping small amounts of acrylic paint colors from drying up during painting details.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter&#x27;s Spa Birthday Party.  And I bought 1 inch labels for them.  We willfed them with foot bath salts, made homemade lip gloss, facial scrub, lotion, you name it!  It would have cost a ton to give the girls little bottles of each for a favor, this was a great alternative!</li>
    <li> A little smaller than what I thought they would be, but ended up loving the size.  Will order again when I need them again.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price! Worked great for homemade lip balm.</li>
    <li> caps and jars did not evenly match when screwed on</li>
    <li> Like these, small and great as samples of my lotion product</li>
    <li> Perfect size and great price</li>
    <li> Love the little boxes and how organized they are and they work really well for my samples of Posh Products.</li>
    <li> Great product! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT. I love these little things. Great to make small solid perfume samples</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected but great for experimenting! Quality ok ,packaging was as described in photo. Priced right for the quantity!</li>
    <li> These are small and cute. All my small containers look fine. I tried opening 8-9 and these open close fine ! Non are cracked or anything. I m happy with my purchase. These ate great to be used as sample containers.</li>
    <li> These little jars are great. Ive used almost half of them already. I use them for lip balms, storing lip scrubs and even my foundation when I&#x27;m on the go since they&#x27;re small. The only thing is that some times the lids of the container break off, but other than that they are awesome.</li>
    <li> These are very cute and small, but smaller than I was expecting initially. These lip balm containers are super small, so if you are looking for something a little bigger, then don&#x27;t go with these. I didn&#x27;t read the description closely enough but other than the size they are great!</li>
    <li> Several lids didn&#x27;t fit the jars they were paired with</li>
    <li> I ordered these to use to make lip scrubs in. I was expecting the size to be slightly larger but I&#x27;m happy with the small size. this size was perfect for my lip scrubs. the quality is great and I think the price is hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;  I love these! highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for home made lip gloss.</li>
    <li> We use these for our body balm samples. Smooth-closing, no rough edges, nice containers, arrived quickly. We will get these again.</li>
    <li> I was able to complete the project I bought these for, fortunately, or they might have garnered only 1 star. Many of the pots had broken lids, and one was missing entirely. One lid broke as it was screwed onto the pot. These were not quality items, and I&#x27;ll be using a different vessel for my home made lip balm next season.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Exactly what we needed. Used to make home made lip gloss for a birthday party. Excellent value. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Comes in a bag not a box like you see in the pic but it&#x27;s still good quality and was shipped fast</li>
    <li> Ok but they are really tiny. I guess I was expecting them to be a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Different weights in jars i have no idea why that would even happen</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for and I&#x27;ll be ordering more shortly!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect size but the lids are hard to get on and liquid seeps out. Great for anything but liquid.</li>
    <li> exactly what i needed for my home made lipsticks</li>
    <li> For the price you cant knock it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is that they where a little smaller then I thought that they would be.</li>
    <li> Smaller than they look buy great mini containers</li>
    <li> Just used these jars for my first batch of salves!  Works amazing! Easy to clean up when you overfill.</li>
    <li> Perfect, I bought to put one dose of foot cream in and it works well!  closes well and is of quality.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My bad???  These jars are nice but 1/2 the size I need for lip balms :~(</li>
    <li> I work with kids and these were perfect for their make your own lip gloss project in their fashion class.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading the description close enough. Containers arrived in good condition.</li>
    <li> Just the perfect size for what I wanted as well as leak proof.</li>
    <li> Work as expected , thank you amazon for having a high quantity of these</li>
    <li> Great for chapstick! These seem like a good quality purchase for the price. They arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Good size for lip balm, all in good condition, lids fit well, easy to use, no leaks. Definitely buying more next time.</li>
    <li> I just started making my own lip balm. These will be perfect for my first few batches, as I experiment with different recipes, and need small containers to use until I see what recipe works best for me. As it turned out, I had to throw away a dozen or so because of my own mistakes. The price is reasonable enough that I didn&#x27;t waste a fortune. These would be good for samplers for a small business, but I don&#x27;t think the quality is good enough for a product that is being sold. The material of the jar is flimsy, and when I tried to screw some of the lids on, if they weren&#x27;t lined up properly, it caused the tiny cracks in the lid. This happened on 2 out of the first 8 I used. As long as you are careful about screwing on the lid, and don&#x27;t try to force it, it fits fine. I like the design of the lid and bottom of the jar-- it has a flat, slightly indented area where a round label can go. By my measurements, a 3/4&amp;#34; round label should work perfectly on the top and/or bottom. Since I&#x27;m just experimenting, I wrote on the lid with a Sharpie and it worked fine. Once I have my recipe perfected I plan on buying slightly bigger containers. This is truly a SAMPLE size, like the description says. These would also be good for party favors or stocking stuffers. I used the disposable pipettes to fill them and I had no mess on the jar.</li>
    <li> Very nice for samples, small labels to put on them would be appreciated, but I&#x27;ll make my own. Came when expected</li>
    <li> These worked great they are very small but I made lip gloss for little add on gifts and for a make and take and they worked perfectly - very happy with the purchase and the price</li>
    <li> I bought these to use for lip balm samples and gifts. They fill up quite nicely. Good construction, easy to open and close. Would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Smaller than wanted but not the seller&#x27;s fault that I don&#x27;t know sizes well yet!  Got it quickly.</li>
    <li> Neat little boxes, they close tight. I use them for seed saving and my own helpful concoctions of essential oils. They do not stack well. I now buy the ones that come in a box and I can keep things organized.</li>
    <li> Convenient for taking cosmetic items on short trips. I also share new products with my daughters for them to try.</li>
    <li> Worked great. I bought for my daughter so she could have container for your crayon lipstick. The containers worked great. I only had 1 or 2 that the lids were not up to par but all in all it works just as discribed.</li>
    <li> The cap is a little difficult to screw back on correctly but other than that they serve the purpose i purchased them for.</li>
    <li> I bought these to put samples in for my passion parties business and I am 100% satisfied. They are the perfect and do not have a cheap feel to them. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I anticipated but they are great!</li>
    <li> Perfect for home made lip balm....couple of them you couldn&#x27;t get open but other than that I love them.  I just ordered 50 more.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised and worked great.  Used them for lip balm for a craft show and they sold like hot cakes.</li>
    <li> They are a lot smaller than I realized that of course is my own fault. I tried comparing to find the exact right size.  They have still worked nicely for homemade lip balms. I was just hoping to give a little bigger lip balm.  Why it&#x27;s not 5 starts,  1 of the lids are cracked so I can&#x27;t use it. Other wise good product and good price.</li>
    <li> Arrived very early and as described.</li>
    <li> Great for making lip balms! Perfect size. Very happy customer!</li>
    <li> Some of the containers did not open</li>
    <li> These are great for what they are sold for, but they are small.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Great product!</li>
    <li> Not high quality! Found them to be cheap and rather small.</li>
    <li> These are my go to sample holders for my Rodan + Fields business. The lids fit nicely and I never feel like they are going to fall off. And not a bad price either.</li>
    <li> These were perfect for making lip balm!</li>
    <li> Worked perfect for my crafts.  Do not put liquid in these as they leak</li>
    <li> perfect size for giving out samples at my vendor shows. great price per each. will order more!</li>
    <li> fast shipping work awesome.</li>
    <li> i think this prouct is amazing next time i need anything im going strait to amozon .com</li>
    <li> Excellent little containers ( 5 gram ) . Well worth the money if you have a use foe them , They also make stickers for lableing the top.</li>
    <li> Several lids were stuck on and nothing could get them off. I had the throw away about 8 of these. The remaining 42 work well.</li>
    <li> This was just what my wife and daughter were looking for.  Quick shipping.  Overall, very satisfied with our purchase.</li>
    <li> The pots were cracked...but that&#x27;s not the worst part....I found RAT FECES IN SOME OF THE CONTAINERS...totally grossed out!&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy these again.</li>
    <li> Product came fast, perfect size, can be disposable, and I will definitely order again! Rated 4 stars only because I wish they offered in different colors for more options but other than that awesome buy!</li>
    <li> They were as expected. Lids fit nicely. I like the clear tops so I can write on the tops to identify contents</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I was expecting the quality of these jars to be a lot higher. They almost seemed like factory seconds. I&#x27;ll most likely buy my jars from a different seller next time.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my arbonne business samples. If you&#x27;re interested in hearing how you can help changes the lives of others while earning an extra income please give me a call 215-932-1657</li>
    <li> These were perfect for my first batch of homemade lip balm.</li>
    <li> I admit that I didn&#x27;t really the descriptions that other buyers wrote and didn&#x27;t know really how big a 5 gram jar was. In case that&#x27;s you, it&#x27;s about half the size of a Burt&#x27;s Bee circle.  That said, my daughter and I used them for lip balm Christmas gifts and are quite pleased the quality of the jars.  And they arrived faster than the beeswax I ordered the same day.</li>
    <li> Just right for essential oils to put in bags on the go.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, clean, well made product.</li>
    <li> These are some of the worst plastic jars I have ever purchased. They are anything but \\&quot;high quality\\&quot;. The threads are rough, some of the caps are cracked, some of the caps are unfinished and have uneven threads... I would return them if I were&#x27;t in dire need of sample containers. I&#x27;m going to have to try and fix the threads myself. Avoid this one folks!</li>
    <li> These are smaller than I thought they would be. I will use them for samples of lip balm that I make and I will have to order bigger ones for actual product. Still a great price and fast arrival. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Better than expected!</li>
    <li> These containers are very very small. They are about the size of a quarter. I expected them to look a bit more like the round cosmetic lip balm containers you get at the store but they are much smaller. You do get a lot for the price I suppose..</li>
    <li> Used for homemade lip gloss. Perfect.</li>
    <li> Terrible quality! They have unfinished edges on the part where the too screws on. They dried out some of the products that I put in them. Some broke while twisting the top on. Didn&#x27;t use a lot of pressure on it whatsoever!</li>
    <li> Items as described. They come in a convenient box. Perfect for loose eyeshadows. Some threads/lids are difficult to screw on so that&#x27;s probably factory defect, but all of them worked. Will order again.</li>
    <li> A lot of these arrived broken or cracked.</li>
    <li> For the price these are a good deal, but several came cracked rendering them useless. the plastic is a bit cheap but they served their purpose.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product.  I use these for lip balms.  And will reorder as needed</li>
    <li> Hard to open, and much smaller than expected. They work great for small samples. I had no problems with leakage.</li>
    <li> Good cases for small samples</li>
    <li> If you are looking for cheap plastic containers, this is them.  Of the 50 containers, 3 would not open without pliers, one was cracked.  They are much smaller than depicted in the photo, the inside is about the size of a quarter.  Lids tighten with 1/4 turn.  I make bees wax lip balm, and the container is a good size for little ones.</li>
    <li> These really came in handy for my samples</li>
    <li> Caps are a little difficult to get on and off</li>
    <li> I just want to say thank you for making this affordable and being generous with the amount of containers for such a low price. You are making things possible for those who use your containers for their own creations. The description fits and the shipping has been excellent. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Looks good.  Can&#x27;t wait to use</li>
    <li> Use these for my handmade lotion samples.  The cover doesn&#x27;t close as well as another brand I had purchased but the price is right.  It still closes ok but not as smooth as I would have hoped.  Still like the product and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly! Great for lip glosses! Will definitely be purchasing more!!</li>
    <li> Just as expected, shipped fast!</li>
    <li> For plastic containers they work great for my lip balm and all of them were in great shape.</li>
    <li> Was not size shown they are tiny ... more like sample sizes for kids</li>
    <li> High quality is definitely not something I&#x27;d use to describe these. Some of them wouldn&#x27;t open and some of them wouldn&#x27;t go back together. Very poor quality plastic and I will not be buying these again. They escaped the 1 star because they were cheap enough to not make me too sad. Just sad that my lip balms looked crappy in them and I felt bad selling the balms in something that was such bad quality.</li>
    <li> Ideal Mini-Paint pots. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my lip balms they&#x27;re the perfect size and work great have bought several packages from them and have never been disappointed</li>
    <li> Love these for sending makeup samples to customers!</li>
    <li> Theses where smaller then I thought they would be but in the end they worked for what I needed! Will be ordering again soon!</li>
    <li> Just as I expected. Was perfect for lip gloss.</li>
    <li> Perfect, thank you will be using seller again</li>
    <li> VERY nice product tight screw on lids, packaging done well, size about nickel circle, maybe a little bigger then nickel, but not as big as quarter, for me GREAT size</li>
    <li> It was exactly as posted.  Great delivery.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my samples of personalized scented whipped shea butter. I will order again</li>
    <li> Nice plastic jars for cosmetics and other various ointments.  I used these for both homemade lip balm and antibiotic ointment, and they work equally well for both.  They&#x27;re much move affordable than comparable jars (which often sell at the same price for a dozen).</li>
    <li> Using these for my homemade lotion and lip balm. Not the greatest quality, but all 50 screw on and off, with none broken.</li>
    <li> A few of these were cracked in the package I received, but otherwise have been great. I fill them with various toiletries to bring when traveling. They are a great size for 3-4 days worth of cleanser/moisturizer etc.</li>
    <li> I made homemade lip balm and passed some samples out at work. Everyone loved these little containers. Thanks.</li>
    <li> A few containers were cracked, but they served their purpose !</li>
    <li> I am just getting into making my own lip balms and herbal salves. I bought these containers to use for lip balms but everyone that I talked to said they preferred using the tubes. I have decided to use these containers for free samples of my balms and salves to help get my homemade products out there. They are very well made and the lid stays on tight when you close this container. My mom keeps hers in her purse and has had no problem with the lid coming loose, which impressed me as I do not use a purse.I will definately be keeping a supply of these on hand, at all times, as I expand my homemade health and beauty products.</li>
    <li> These ended up being the perfect containers for samples of body butter to give away with other purchases. The lids take a little fussing to get on, but if you take your time, they&#x27;ll go back on just fine. They are very small which is perfect for my application. I&#x27;ll get these again to use for more samples - the price is right!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting</li>
    <li> Very small. No bigger than the size of a penny.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, little small but will work</li>
    <li> Perfect for lip balm!  The lids fit well and were easy to remove and screw on.</li>
    <li> Awesome! besides the lid doesn&#x27;t quite line up with the bottle. But i can over look it! and so can the people i am selling them to. Love  it. Also prefect size!</li>
    <li> Perfect for diy lip balm.</li>
    <li> Love these little pots.  They are perfect for my little business.</li>
    <li> Smaller than anticipated and a few (5 or 6) were broken</li>
    <li> MINI.... but perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 boxes of these on two separate occasions. I was surprised that they are completely different in size. If they come in different variations of 5 Gram, then we (as the buyer) should be able to choose. Now I have two different size lip balms and of course the bigger ones are more appealing.</li>
    <li> They are perfect for samples or lip balms. Love!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reordered these twice already - I absolutely love them.  They arrive on time and in good order and are the perfect size to send or give samples.  They are sturdy.  I have not run across a bad or defective one yet.  I use these for cosmetic samples.  I would recommend them to anyone looking to use for samples.  I will be ordering from this seller again.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect size for my daughters lip balm making hobby. The lids screw on nice and tight and they are thick sturdy containers. They arrived all in perfect condition. We will buy these again when ours run out.</li>
    <li> These lip balm pots are absolutely perfect! Also they are a very reasonable price and I am so happy I found them on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Held the lip gloss may daughter sold and gave as gift perfectly.</li>
    <li> Clean, arrived in good time. All are intact and easy to use. Worth the money</li>
    <li> Had some trouble with the threads matching up while opening &amp; closing - although I sort of expected that. I&#x27;ll probably buy tins or tubes for my homemade lip balms &amp; glosses.</li>
    <li> Some of the lids are really hard to get off and some of the lids don&#x27;t really seem like they fit on the jars. The jars are actually smaller than I expected them to be too.</li>
    <li> Nice for the price but I am not &amp;#34;high in&amp;#34; in makeup though.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised!  Quick delivery, good packaging---all good!</li>
    <li> I bought these to use for lip gloss. They worked great! I have also used them for many other things. They are a great size for little things in your purse or suitcase while traveling.</li>
    <li> These are perfect-- I also order on TKB Trading, but I sometimes need things fast, so I order these jars. I think, in general, these jars are fine and on par with what I buy from TKB Trading. But every once in a while, I get a kind of messed up jar. It works though. I&#x27;d love if they offered a version with sifters.</li>
    <li> As described and shipper sent fast.</li>
    <li> These are cute little jars. I used them for lip balms this Christmas. My only issue with them is that some of the lids don&#x27;t fit very well.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for makeup samples.  I will reorder.</li>
    <li> perfect sample size love it, will buy again</li>
    <li> Purchased for homemade lip balm for baby shower favors. They are good quality, arrived quickly, and in good shape. They hold just the right amount of balm.</li>
    <li> i seriously don&#x27;t know why i bought so many</li>
    <li> These were a nice quality. Have already ordered more.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> These containers are FANTASTIC. I bought them for sample container and they are the perfect size. Great quality and weight. All the lids fit/screw on perfectly.</li>
    <li> These work great for cream samples (like essential oil pain cream) and also for lip balm!</li>
    <li> Best bead storage ever!</li>
    <li> these were not good, the lids did not screw on correctly, really bad quality, I wont buy again</li>
    <li> Great quality, fair price. The description was accurate. I knew exactly what size I was ordering. The tops are easy to screw on and the plastic is sturdy.</li>
    <li> These are great when you get some of those packet makeup samples and have some left over. Why throw it out? Put it in one of these jar and label them! It keeps face products fresh so you can get more use out of samples. The only issue is that if you tighten it a little too much the top cracks.</li>
    <li> The lids were easy to put on and sturdy. I used these for body butter samples. I wasn&#x27;t overly gentle putting the lids on but I didn&#x27;t man handle them either. None broke. Will buy again next time I need to make samples.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for to safely mail serum pods by mail for my business. They work perfect. Ordered through Amazon Prime and came with in 2 days.</li>
    <li> will continue to buy them. great product for lip balms.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Just as described. Nothing broken. Great value.</li>
    <li> Perfect Size. Ready for more!!</li>
    <li> Arrived in the box nicely organized - no breaks or cracks! I use these for my creams and gels when going on a plane. Saves space and a lot of my products don&#x27;t come in travel sizes.</li>
    <li> I just got these, a little smaller than I thought but none the less truly awesome. Packaged very well and not a single scratch on any of the plexi pots. Arrived in mint condition.</li>
    <li> I make a lot of my own cosmetics and soaps, lotions, etc., so when I saw this box of 50 clear jars, I thought of lip balm and lip gloss. Not to mention sample-sized jars of lotions and body wash. The jars are plastic, which is great, because you don&#x27;t want glass in the shower for body wash. There are several ways to use these besides cosmetics too. The are great for organizing small objects, like thumbtacks, small craft items, etc. Plus, the price is exceptional for these. So glad I bought them and I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> every person who is in the profession of making their own salves or body butters, or beauty products, ect. should have a box of these! they are awesome for sample sizes of product. my customers love them to try something new, without having to pay the price of a regular size. (essential oils are not cheap). this holds just enough to get the full benefit of the product &amp; let them decide if it works for them. i really love these, &amp; they have helped my business grow. i tried using other containers from eo sites, but they were still a tad to large (1 oz). this size is perfect &amp; lids are very secure. im so happy i found them, they are a staple for me now. blessings abound!</li>
    <li> Smaller than what I wanted, but have found many uses for them.</li>
    <li> these worked great. other review said many did not open...but I had 0 issues! We used them for making lip gloss at my daughter&#x27;s slumber party...BIG HIT!</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected and worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> Small and cheap looking. It might be better to pay a little more and find a better quality product.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  These were beautiful, in a nice box and are great for my samples!</li>
    <li> These are a great little find!  I use these to make makeup and I like they feel of the containers in my hand.  The containers are great if your especially just starting out making products to sell.  Shipping and packaging was great and you can never have to many of them.  Although I do look forward to getting larger containers one day these are great in the mean time.</li>
    <li> Bigger then I expected but I should of realize they hold 5 grams</li>
    <li> Very nice, but is a little bigger then I thought</li>
    <li> I am well pleased with these. Right size, best price online, no shipping.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than expected, however they seem like good quality.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my nail supplies.</li>
    <li> For the price and the amount of mini containers this was the best buy! I am very happy about this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great for my Organic lotion samples.&lt;br /&gt;Love the cheap price!</li>
    <li> These small container are perfect for lip balm and so much more. Endless possibilities. Very pleased with the service and delivery. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was happy overall with the product.  One lid out of 50 would not come off.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely perfect for FACE PAINTING! We bought the Paradise Cakes and broke them up into small pieces to place in these jars for the kids to paint each others faces with. It was so much fun and NOT MESSY at all! Great idea for kids parties! Thank you for a nice product. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for what I need.  I use for my homemade salves, and creams for mixing retinoid for evening facial care.</li>
    <li> There are very tiny, but ok if thts whts u are looking for.</li>
    <li> They really work for my samples</li>
    <li> Perfect for product samples.</li>
    <li> I got them for lip balm and lip scrub, perfect mini size</li>
    <li> Returned not big enough</li>
    <li> These work well to give little samples of beauty or face products you want to share with others. We use these for Make &amp; Takes when promoting essential oils like sugar lip scrubs. These are small - sample size. I don&#x27;t think I would use them for lip gloss or balms as they are a bit small. Seem to be well made. The lids screw on and off with no trouble at all. Plastic seems sturdy enough. Will buy again when I need more.</li>
    <li> Perfect! And at an amazing price</li>
    <li> I purchased these to use as lip balm pots, which they are very well suited for.  My only complaint is that some of the lids get stuck while trying to open and close them.  Otherwise, these are really nice and make wonderful little gift containers for homemade lip gloss and other makeup recipes.  These also make handy storage containers for seed beads.  Love the versatility.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and right on time</li>
    <li> Perfect &amp; fast shipping</li>
    <li> great product. super fast shipping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not great with visually imaging sizes, so these are way tinier than I was expecting. They are great and serve their purpose but you need to expect something really little!</li>
    <li> I use this in making natural, organic lip balm. Perfect size to fit into a pocket or a purse!</li>
    <li> Fantastic material, great for storing make up samples, beads,etc.</li>
    <li> I use these for making lipgloss, and they&#x27;re perfect little pots for it.  I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with lids, although one came cracked.  For the price, though, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.  I&#x27;m also using them as organizers for my smallest sewing supplies (hook and eye closures) and they&#x27;re perfect for making sure nothing gets lost.</li>
    <li> These were perfect for my personal lip balm needs.  I was filling/using the tubes, but since I&#x27;d go through them so quickly and would find myself using my fingernail to dig out the remaining stuff, I decided to give these a try.  They are super small, so they still fit easily in my pocket like the tube.  They do feel a little cheap or extra light, compared to my BareMinerals containers, so don&#x27;t expect that quality at all.  But, they have not broken, they screw on and off okay.  I am not sure I would use them in retail, though, especially if I was trying to sell a homemade, high-end product. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Bought these for loose glitter. They&#x27;re perfect!</li>
    <li> Worked as a sample size container for my product. also good purse size for thick cream.</li>
    <li> This product was perfect for homemade lip gloss. They stay together well, and are the perfect size. Thank you for fast delivery and a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Excellent Value, Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great for makeup samples! They do not leak for semi-solids and are a great price. Will leak for liquids. Some tops don&#x27;t open so I end up throwing some out.</li>
    <li> Great quality. We use them for samples of lotions and soaps and they do not leak (if lids are placed appropiately and tightly).</li>
    <li> These are so cute for homemade chapstick. Doesn&#x27;t hold too much but it was great to make samples for my family.</li>
    <li> These were a wonderful buy! I will definitely buy again for sample sizes</li>
    <li> It is working great for what I am using for. Definately would buy again!</li>
    <li> Cheap quality. Lids are very complicated to get on. The plastic is messed up. Had to throw some away due to this issue.</li>
    <li> These 5 gram pots are the perfect size for giving samples of product. They are clear and seal completely. I haven&#x27;t had any leak.</li>
    <li> These were excellent for my cosmetic trials also I have used them for my Lip Balm trials. Loved them I will be ordering these again!!!</li>
    <li> Very poor quality, the lids are not easy to close, cheap look and feel.</li>
    <li> SMALLER THAN EXPECTED</li>
    <li> works for why i needed them.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! Perfect for my make-Up samples that i mail to customers. No problems at all.</li>
    <li> Awesome tight fitting lids, nothing was broken despite negative reviews I had read.</li>
    <li> Great for product samples.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> Just love these little guys...perfect size.</li>
    <li> Love love my aunt was so happy!!!</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected.. However will work for sampling.</li>
    <li> Works great and good quality</li>
    <li> Great product. Held up well. Good price.</li>
    <li> These were great for my pigments and to store my DIY lipstick. Get quality. Will  repurchase.</li>
    <li> I bought these for storing acrylic paint during a project. &#x27;Remix&#x27; of colors can be problematic. With these I am able to mix a little more than I need and I never have to &#x27;remix.&#x27; The bottles are air tight therefore eliminating problem of paint drying out. The sean-up nicely and retain the clear finish.</li>
    <li> Missing lids. Not as advertised</li>
