    <li> Been using it for 40 years.  great product!</li>
    <li> I saw a show on the mustang ranch and the prostitutes told the interviewer on camera that they used this for lube in Reno (very dry climate).  I tried it and it last unlike water based which quickly dry out. I&#x27;m single and when I need a bit of extra lube,  I reach for this.  Get the unscented type.</li>
    <li> great price and great delivery time.</li>
    <li> If you want sweat. This is awesome. I rub it on and wrap my stomach. Work out and I am drenched. with continous use it has also softened my belly skin.</li>
    <li> This product performs even better than the manufacturer claims. It moisturizes, doesn&#x27;t irritate, never dries out, gives the skin a great feeling too. Great for cleansing, for moisturizing, and lubricates too.</li>

    <li> I overheard two older women with great skin talking about this product  in Walgreen&#x27;s.  I was out of town on vacation and I had forgotten to pack lotion. Although it&#x27;s labeled as a makeup remover, they said it was a facial moisturizer and more.  It can be used for many things! It&#x27;s helped my clear up my dry skin and eczema. It&#x27;s lighter than Vaseline but provides similar coverage.</li>
    <li> Very nice product for my super dry skin.... My skin is very well moisturized daily after my shower.. By the way it also remove make up well.</li>
    <li> If you want to sweat this product is for you-I did not believe the reviews and someone at the gym had recommended, but this truly increases your sweat levels during a work out, let alone moisturizes your skin wonderfully-duel purpose product!  Love it and can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS MOISTURIZING CLEANSER FOR OVER 35 YEARS.  I STARTED USING IT WHEN I WAS WORKING FOR A SHOW BUSINESS COMPANY, AND THE ACTORS ALWAYS USED THIS PRODUCT FOR REMOVING ALL THEIR MAKEUP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; IT WAS VERY INEXPENSIVE (AND STILL IS) AND DOES ITS JOB.  IN LATER YEARS I DEVELOPED &amp;#34;DRY EYES&amp;#34;.  I COULD PRACTICALLY PUT IT INTO MY EYES AND NEVER EXPERIENCED ANY ITCHING OR BURNING.  IT NEVER FAILS TO REMOVE THE HEAVIEST EYE MAKEUP WITHIN SECONDS.  IT MOISTURIZES BEAUTIFULLY AND REMOVES ALL MAKEUP WITHIN SECONDS.  I WOULD NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE SINCE IT IS ODERLESS (altho they also have a scented version, if desired)  WHY BUY EXPENSIVE CREAMS WHEN THIS LIFE-SAVER IS AVAILABLE?</li>
    <li> We have used Albolene for excema for 15 years. It&#x27;s the best right after taking a shower. Put it in all your dry spots. Towel off. Not greasy like baby oil. It&#x27;s the best. Try it.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it works great when you are working out and need that additional sweat. Its good for your skin as well. Doesnt leave any residue behind when you take off your sweat band. I notice a immediate difference in my mid-section since I started using it.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I use this product around my waist when I exercise with plastic wrap.  Also it is great for removing makeup from my face without that gumpy feeling.</li>
    <li> this is asome for having sex</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for anyone who edges.</li>
    <li> Have used Albolene for years.  Good stuff.  This is a very good buy and it&#x27;s nice to know I can order it so easily because I can&#x27;t always find it when I run out of it and need to buy more.  This way I can reorder when I need to.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this for more than 60 years, and everybody says she has the most beautiful complexion.</li>
    <li> Wonderful.....skin is soft and smooth. Face is moisturized and clean, make up is removed quickly. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mom, she uses thst for years</li>
    <li> I purchased the albolene because the reviews said it helps you shed off belly fat.  It didn&#x27;t make me sweat much but I love it for moisture and it&#x27;s good to use it as massaging someone.</li>
    <li> Works great for many body parts.</li>
    <li> A great product helps skin to heal and remove make up gently keep the skin soft without damaging the skin.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I can use to take off my eye makeup. I get really bad reaction from products, this is amazing. I also use this when I work out. I rub some on my stomach area wrap a workout belt around my waist and when I take that thing off the sweat just pours out. Love it</li>
    <li> this formula is amazing!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years to remove my eye makeup.  I love how it removes my makeup and leaves my eye area supple.  I give it a 10!  My five daughters, ages 18-25, use it too.</li>
    <li> I use this product but the where I purchased it stop selling it.  This is an excellent product &amp; it made my skin soft and supple.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t live without this to wash my face - its what your grandmother used and nothing makes your skin more moist, soft, dewey looking, younger - people have been asking me what I do to my shin -  washing my skin with it. You have to get used to it at first seems greasy splask it off with warm water lots and lots of times and - and then your skin never felt and looked so good.</li>
    <li> I use it as a facial cleanser; although I do not wear make up. It leaves my face feeling soft and smooth. More importantly, I use it with my waist trimmer (sometimes my thighs) during exercise. It leaves my waist drenched in sweat, with the added bonus of leaving my skin smooth.</li>
