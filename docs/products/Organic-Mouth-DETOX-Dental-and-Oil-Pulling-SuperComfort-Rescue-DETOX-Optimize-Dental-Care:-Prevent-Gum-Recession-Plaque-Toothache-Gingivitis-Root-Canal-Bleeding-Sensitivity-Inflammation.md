      <li>As you can probably guess, I would highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>Have only been using for a week or so, but I&#x27;m hoping I will see some positive changes in my dental health!</li>
      <li>Hence I did the same routine doing the oil-pulling first followed by the tooth powder application.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had teeth trouble all my life, going through several teeth pulling and more cavities than I can count, which puzzles me because I&#x27;m a holistic person as a whole</li>

      <li>I was really surprised with the effectiveness of the product.</li>

      <li>By morning my throat is back to normal.  </li>
      <li>It would have cost me 300$ to have my tooth extracted leaving a large gap that would have made it more difficult to chew food.</li>
      <li>I apparently had a cavity into a filling that decayed below the surface...</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t fall, and put my head back as far as I can and gargle away.  </li>
      <li>The tooth pain completely disappeared and it has been almost 24 hours since that second application.</li>
      <li>I do steam therapy when I have a sore throat and a large build up of mucous, and I really have to couch hard to get it out of my throat, but with this, the mucous sort of glides out.</li>

      <li>I have been using this product for approximately one year and am delighted to learn I can purchase it on Amazon for several dollars less than our local apothecary charges.  </li>

      <li>Since I have some root exposure &amp; extreme sensitivity in two areas,  I am highly motivated to stop it from happening.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very good.  will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It was about a week before I opened the package to use it and while I have only used it twice (within an twenty-four hour period) this was enough for me to experience noticeable positive effects on which I base this review. First of all when I feel the onset of discomfort associated with a  problem tooth in my mouth I usually begin with a coconut oil-pull swishing for twenty minutes followed by brushing with (an ultra soft toothbrush) salt toothpaste and ending with a propolis-containing or manuka oil toothpaste. But just recently I felt a different kind of pain in a problem tooth--the kind that you feel when you bite down--so I decided to try the SuperComfort Rescue Mouth Detox and Oil-Pulling. Since I did not buy the mouthwash I used another natural-type brand and then followed this up with an application of the SuperComfort Rescue Tooth Powder; this I did not rinse after using. Since I did this all before retiring for the night, when I woke up in the morning the tooth pain was still noticeable but greatly diminished. Hence I did the same routine doing the oil-pulling first followed by the tooth powder application. The tooth pain completely disappeared and it has been almost 24 hours since that second application. The conclusion is that Dr. Arenander&#x27;s SuperComfort Rescue products have worked for me and I will definitely reorder them along with an order for the mouthwash. It would have cost me 300$ to have my tooth extracted leaving a large gap that would have made it more difficult to chew food. It is well worth the money in trying to preserve the integrity of any tooth (after having it filled) in the mouth.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT ----I USUALLY USE COCONUT OIL -----MUCH CHEAPER ---BUT THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT ----VERY CONVENIENT</li>
    <li> I will buy it again, no morning breath after using this product, oral care has improved 100%</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t like the feel of swishing oil in my mouth.  I know it&#x27;s good for oral care, but it&#x27;s just unpleasant to me.</li>
    <li> This products so great. It&#x27;s help me for sore throat. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is well worth the price. I&#x27;ve had teeth trouble all my life, going through several teeth pulling and more cavities than I can count, which puzzles me because I&#x27;m a holistic person as a whole and I hate pop and stay away from candy. But a couple of my teeth have been hurting, the kind of hurt that means, oh-crud-I-think-this-is-going-to-need-to-be-pulled kind of hurt. The constant kind of pain that persists even when you haven&#x27;t chewed or had anything too sugary. But my sister recommended this product to me, and well, I&#x27;ve open to trying the holistic methods over the conventional ones, so I tried it. Now normally when I wake up after seven hours or so, I have this thick, yellow, almost green tint thick mucous in my mouth. I brush right before going to sleep, so it really builds up as I sleep. I have to brush again right after I wake up because it tastes and smells disgusting. But the first time I tried this, (I swished for the whole 10 minutes), I woke up and my mouth was completely clean. No mucous, no build up, and one of the most relieving effects, my teeth have stopped hurting. I don&#x27;t think I need to go to the dentist anymore and have the important teeth pulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one other side effect that isn&#x27;t mentioned that I don&#x27;t know if anyone else experiences, but every time I swish and spit, I cough up wads of mucous. I do steam therapy when I have a sore throat and a large build up of mucous, and I really have to couch hard to get it out of my throat, but with this, the mucous sort of glides out.

    <li> This product has a horrible flavor. Many other products available that taste better with good results. I&#x27;m using OB Well now.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for approximately one year and am delighted to learn I can purchase it on Amazon for several dollars less than our local apothecary charges.  It is the best mouth detox I have ever used.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those familiar with oil pulling (swishing oil in the mouth to reduce bacteria, infection, plaque buildup, etc), Super Rescue Mouth Detox does so much more than regular oil pulling.  I find the combination of herbs, minerals &amp; oil is also healing my gums.  I was inspired to try it when a friend told me her gum shrinkage was reduced significantly over time from using this product.  She also massages her gums gently with her finger when she is finished swishing (before rinsing her mouth with water).  Since I have some root exposure &amp; extreme sensitivity in two areas,  I am highly motivated to stop it from happening.  I swish for about 3 - 5 minutes twice per day.  My mouth feels fresh and clean and plaque build up is hardly happening any more.  My gums are so much healthier, but the biggest surprise &amp; benefit is when I feel a sore throat/ear infection coming on.  I gargle with this oil immediately (I&#x27;ll explain the process below).  Believe it or not, within hours not only is the sore throat gone, but so is the inner ear pain.  Sometimes it starts only on one side.  Then in a day or two it ends up on the other side, or both.  Since I&#x27;m using this product, it does not travel from one side to the other.  The infection is stopped in its tracks.  The biggest result is when I gargle before bed.  By morning my throat is back to normal.  No more infection; no more pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my method:  I fill a small bathroom disposable dixie cup with 1/4 inch of the product (shake it well before pouring).  Perhaps this amounts to a tablespoon full (or a bit more, not sure).  I take a deep breath, put it all in my mouth, hang on to the sink so I don&#x27;t fall, and put my head back as far as I can and gargle away.  Every now &amp; then you&#x27;ll have to hold it in your mouth &amp; take another breath so  you can keep gargling.  It is important to get the herbalized oil far back into your throat so it can kill the bacteria that caused the flare up.  Always release the oil it back into the little cup &amp; stuff the cup with a tissue or towel paper &amp; throw it in the trash.  Don&#x27;t pour the oil down the sink or it may clog your drains over time.  I rinse my mouth with fresh water when I&#x27;m  done (but don&#x27;t gargle with water; let the formula do its job).  If I feel an infection coming on in the morning or afternoon, I won&#x27;t wait until bedtime to do this.  I&#x27;ll start gargling right away and repeat the process every two hours or so, then again at bedtime.  I have never had a sore throat last long enough to see a doctor since using this product.  I think it is amazing &amp; highly recommend it.  If you are not prone to sore throats (I still have tonsils that get infected), you&#x27;re dentist will surely notice when you have your check ups!e to hold it in your mouth &amp; take another breath so  you can keep gargling.

    <li> Simply doesn&#x27;t work. Also, it feels like I&#x27;m gargling slime, because that&#x27;s literally what it is. If your mouth isn&#x27;t sensitive, buy some cinnamon sticks, or cinnamon gum. Good for halitosis.</li>
    <li> For my particular problem I did not see the results I expected...BUT The company staff was EXCELLENT..Refunded cost with no hassle..I have come to find that the product is viable for long term good dental and gum health.I apparently had a cavity into a filling that decayed below the surface...To much for this product to overcome</li>
    <li> My mouth did not like the product&#x27;s taste. It may do what it advertises, but first one has to swish it around one&#x27;s mouth. Ugg.</li>
    <li> I had read another review of this Mouth Detox about using it for swishing and gargling when feeling a sore throat or earache. I tried it recently for a sore throat (which usually develops into a full blown cold for me). I just gargled with it several times that day and by the morning all signs of the sore throat were gone! How great to have something that works really well to stop a nasty cold that could last weeks! I also use the Detox to &amp;#34;oil pull&amp;#34; every morning. It&#x27;s very effective to pull out pesky toxins from all over my physiology before they cause any disease. Thank you Drs. Arenander for this great product!  Gail M.</li>
    <li> I gargled with this the other day.... My sore throat was gone afterwards!</li>
    <li> very thick, could not taste any herbs in it just the oil. Not clear if its working</li>
    <li> It tastes very strange. It has a cerealish taste.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
    <li> I have seen a huge difference in my mouth.  I have a dx. Of necrosis of the jaw bone with gum, plaque, and issues with healing after maintanance of any kind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted!  My teeth, gums and breath have never felt or smelled cleaner. Ingredients are top quality.</li>
    <li> Ingredients: cured sesame oil, sesame oil, Himalayan crystal salt, Primordial Plant Minerals, clove oil, neem oil, Ringing cedar of russia cedar nut and sea buckthorn berry oils, fine clays, turmeric, licorice, ginger, pippali, processed fortified Miswak, white oak bark, amalaki, haritaki, non-GMO xylitol (birch), yarrow, clove, tulsi, Ecchinacea, Purpurea root, cinnamon, cardamon, musta powder, peppermint oil, pur camphor oil and powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words this stuff tastes like tree bark and I haven&#x27;t been able to use it at all,because the taste alone engages my gag response every time so I can&#x27;t say whether or not this product works..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased it, this product had little to no reviews, and now it has several reviews. Read them.&lt;br /&gt;if you want oil go with coconut oil.</li>
    <li> So much better than coconut oil! Love the taste of this. Have only been using for a week or so, but I&#x27;m hoping I will see some positive changes in my dental health!</li>
    <li> It taste is a shock and salty. Very hard to take, but it does leave the mouth moist overnight. I contribute this to the clove oil in it</li>
    <li> Want to save your gums and teeth? Stop using fluoride. Use the powder to power clean your teeth and protect your gums.So glad I found this!</li>
    <li> was using only coconut oil or sesame oil but this is great. No overwhelming taste! The effects for health are unbeatable</li>
    <li> This helped with some tooth pain I was having. Can&#x27;t speak on the effects long term as the bottle is small and it depends on how often you use it. Overall I would recommend this.</li>
