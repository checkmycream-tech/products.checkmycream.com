      <li>I bought it for a Christmas gift, no negative reports</li>
      <li>It allows you to comfortably soak your feet with lots of room for maneuvering to scrub and removed dead skin.</li>
      <li>It is deep enough, sturdy enough and large enough.  </li>

<li> Mmmm....perfect size, with soothing little bumps on the bottom.</li>
<li> Problem is: now water is harder to keep from sloshing out and it is hard to carry without a handle.  </li>
<li> This is a sturdy, heavy, hard plastic basin.  </li>
<li> I am usually finished with my feet.</li>

    <li> its too big and clumsy, and when filled with water its too heavy for me to carry I don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my father-in- law and he said that it was better than using a bucket. The product is well made and should last a long time.</li>
    <li> It is durable, I like it for my foot baths.</li>
    <li> Really Nice and Sturdy, I asked quite  a few questions regarding the basin, but I&amp;#34;m really pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This tub is sturdy and fits large feet. It is easy to handle when both filling it and pouring it out.</li>
    <li> My husband can fit his feet in this tub.  I thought I could just go out and buy any tub and I couldn&#x27;t because they were not deep enough or big enough.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Thought it a bit pricey at first until I realized how sturdy it was. Can&#x27;t compare to substitutes. It works great and cleans up well and continues to look new:)</li>
    <li> Wonderful! It allows you to comfortably soak your feet with lots of room for maneuvering to scrub and removed dead skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent just what we needed.  It arrived in time as promised.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Mmmm....perfect size, with soothing little bumps on the bottom. Love this thing!</li>
    <li> I bought it for a Christmas gift, no negative reports</li>
    <li> This product is nice and light weight, yet durable.  Will work great for easy in travel and clean up!  Thanks</li>
    <li> Great size if you have big feet</li>
    <li> This is a sturdy, heavy, hard plastic basin.  It is a great size--even my husband&#x27;s size 11 feet will fit in it nicely!  It is deep enough to cover the feet and ankles.  It has nice hand grips on each side so that it will be easy to carry and to empty.  Years ago I worked in a hospital setting and this was the type of material used there.  I don&#x27;t know how you could wear this out!  Happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I soaked my feet for the first time last night and discovered that unless you fill it pretty much to the top you don&#x27;t get a very good soak.  Problem is: now water is harder to keep from sloshing out and it is hard to carry without a handle.  I am going to have to buy the spa bucket with the handle.  Guess I&#x27;ll be keeping this one for my hubby--hopefully he will enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I have size 14 feet. This fits them perfectly for soaking. I only gave it four stars because I&#x27;d like it a little deeper.</li>
    <li> I really like the basin it is very strong</li>
    <li> Great footpath, exactly what I was searching for</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t interested in a fancy massaging whirlpool foot basin. I just wanted something very basic to fill with warm water that was sturdy. This product meets my needs. It is deep enough, sturdy enough and large enough.  As with any foot basin, some people might have difficulty carrying the basin filled with water so be careful, especially if filled with hot water. Some people just place the basin where they want and fill it using a jug. For me it was a good buy.</li>
    <li> Y 30 bucks for a bucket...right, I&#x27;ll pass. I&#x27;ll take my chances with the 20 buck electric foot spa, thank you.</li>
    <li> very quick delivery. sturdy foot basins. i can actually stand on these basins when placed upside down. love them for my ionic foot detox</li>
    <li> This foot basin is nice and simple in design and functionality. It has little nodules on the floor of the unit so to be able to message your feet while soaking. The only small downside is that it doesn&#x27;t have a place to rest your feet on if you want to do a pedicure. But this unit is really light and easy to clean which makes tending to one&#x27;s feet a welcomed engagement. This is the perfect kind of basin to buy is you like using foot soaps which can clog up the motorized basins (That&#x27;s what happened with my last on). So I had to trade a heated basin for one without. I thought that I would miss the heat but I just put really hot water in the basin and by the time it becomes luke warm I am usually finished with my feet. Good product, and not expensive. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> What the doctor order as they say.</li>
    <li> Great fit for extra large feet, size 13-14+.  No massage features.  Plain large tub.</li>
    <li> Was hoping it would be big enough for my husbands big feet and it is. Nice heavy plastic too.Good product.</li>
    <li> Love this foot basin.  It is just the right size.  It is easy to carry once full and is easy to empty.  Love the raised bumps on the bottom of the basin as they act as a massager on the bottoms of my feet.</li>
    <li> Not at all flimsy, very solid. No fear of spilling when emptying.</li>
