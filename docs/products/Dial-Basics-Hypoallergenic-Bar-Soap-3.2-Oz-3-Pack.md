      <li>(Contains One or More of These Ingredients)), Water, Talc, Coconut Acid, Palm Acid, Tallow Acid, Palm Kernel Acid (Contains One or More of These Ingredients), Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum), Sorbitol, Sodium Chloride, Pentasodium Penetate, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>When a bar of soap looked like a bar of soap and lasted more than two weeks.</li>
      <li>I found this soap in a dispenser at a restaurant and loved the smell so much I came to amazon to buy my own.</li>
      <li>and I had MORE sensitivity issue with it.</li>
      <li>Works well, but the most offputting thing to me is the smell.  </li>
      <li>Needed it Love it.</li>
      <li>I guess for washing your body it would be ok (though I haven&#x27;t tried)</li>
      <li>Nice fragrance of clean soap without perfume.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, suds up well, rinses off well, and leaves your skin feeling good.  </li>
      <li>Bought thinking that this would be the perfect product for my super sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>this is great soap for sensitive  skin</li>
      <li>It has a nice clean, practically odorless, smell and for those like me with perfume allergies, it is the perfect product for everyday use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very allergic to most soaps, breaking out in a rash, so I was thrilled to find the Dial Basics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Do not know how they can say something is HypoAllergenic and has a fragrance so strong.</li>
      <li>Not too strong.</li>
      <li>Despite the conflicting information this soap is not without a moderately strong floral scent, like lavender.</li>
      <li>My skin seems to like it just fine.</li>
      <li>Palm oil is a cheap filler oil and palm oil plantations can devastate the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>basically gave me the soap free.  </li>
      <li>Thought this would not be filled with fragrance, because fragrance is NOT hypoallergenic ever...</li>
      <li>Most commercial soap isn&#x27;t going to be as good as handmade soap.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay soap, but I don&#x27;t think it compares very much to the great texture and scents of the former &amp;#34;pure and natural&amp;#34; bar soaps.</li>
      <li>&quot; It&#x27;s a great *basic* hand or complexion soap: bright white that doesn&#x27;t crack; silky smooth feel; light, fresh scent; washes off easily with no residue.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking all over for the perfect bar of facial soap for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Rinses clean leaves no residue</li>
      <li>and you feel clean after using it.</li>
      <li>The difficulty is finding &#x27;gentle&#x27; but &#x27;able to really clean&#x27; as well.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was the super strong scent.</li>
      <li>there&#x27;s still some left (about 20%) from that first bar - good mileage.</li>
      <li>Maybe it is expecting too much for a \\&quot;Hypoallergenic\\&quot; soap to be fragrance free, but I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
      <li>I itched for about 20mins and had to take an antihistamine to calm the inflammation.</li>
      <li>This product is worth purchasing online.  </li>
      <li>Nice basic bar soap, no fancy creams or perfumes.</li>
      <li>No soap is worth that.  </li>
      <li>I just happened to find some at a dollar store and the size seemed right for traveling -</li>
      <li>Your best bet is buying an all natural handmade soap (from a local farmer&#x27;s market or local retailer).  </li>
      <li>The bar soap has such a strong fragrance!  </li>
      <li>Very disheartening to have sensitive skin and not be able to find any affordable soap to use.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I use it as a facial and hand soap and just love it.</li>
      <li>I first spotted it in the discount store and decided to try it.</li>
      <li>Its basic soap, but that&#x27;s all most of us are looking for.</li>
      <li>Look for an all natural soap that is fragrance and color free.</li>
      <li>I really thought better of Dial and have used their products for many years, but no more.</li>
      <li>Most of you are probably suffering from dry skin, not an allergy or sensitivity.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this product, in conjunction with hypoallergenic deodorant, have helped me tremendously.  </li>
      <li>Would not recommend this to anyone who is super sensitive.</li>
      <li>A lifesaver for those of us with super sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>For anyone who&#x27;s typically allergic to soaps and detergents, it probably would be fine for getting clean in tub or shower, too.</li>
      <li>Except for Dove, Dial Basics, which used to be Pure and Natural, is the only soap I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t break out my skin.  </li>
      <li>this hard to find soap is great for sensitive skin /o spending a bunch of money.</li>
      <li>Real color free soap will probably be an off white or cream color.  </li>
      <li>So much for hypoallergenic soap.</li>
      <li>It smells very clinical.</li>
      <li>It has a light scent similar to what you&#x27;d find in a hotel room soap.</li>
      <li>and it is a real hit.</li>
      <li>because it says dermatologist tested doesn&#x27;t mean the dermatologist said it was good...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re the same soap, just branded differently.</li>
      <li>that was really the main reason I picked some up.</li>
      <li>The first indication of not being for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>However, I can attest to the fact that is makes my skin feel fresh, clean and not weighed down.</li>
      <li>Most stores that sell this sell it for less then $1.59</li>
      <li>and that is to pull their best products making them impossible to find.  </li>
      <li>Live this sensitive skin soap!!!</li>
      <li>highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I had to start using this because i used to buy pure &amp; natural</li>
      <li>Dial has discontinued the Pure and Natural soap.</li>
      <li>I figure I&#x27;ll need to appeal to the company directly to keep it!!</li>
      <li>If you look at the ingredients for this soap \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; is right there in the middle.</li>
      <li>I have used pure &amp; natural for years because I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t tolerate scented anything.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t want to live without it.</li>
      <li>If you are sensitive to fragrances STAY AWAY from this soap!</li>
      <li>There are a lot more people who are starting to have allergic reactions to all the chemicals in perfumes and other fragrances in assorted items, including soap.</li>
      <li>I WANT MY PURE &amp; NATURAL BACK!</li>
      <li>This is not the same as the Pure and Natural which contained no perfume.  </li>
      <li>Clearly, this soap is not for people who are hypoallergenic.</li>
      <li>I do not have sensitive skin, so I cannot attest to the hypo allergenic claim.</li>
      <li>did purchase the basis (not Basics) sensitive skin bar soap also</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you are looking for a hypoallergenic soap, this is it. My mom is allergic to everything and this is the only soap she can handle</li>
    <li> Dial has discontinued the Pure and Natural soap. The new Basic is same as P&amp;N.    I used to paid $.99 for three bars of P&amp;N. But due to the scarcity of a discontinued soap. Some places are now charging a fortune for them.    Do yourselves a favor, get the Basic instead. They are identical. My local grocery stores sell them for $1.30 for 3 bars.</li>
    <li> I have used pure &amp; natural for years because I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t tolerate scented anything. This was the perfect soap until they discontinued it. I am NOT going to pay $9 for something I used to buy for $1 at dollar tree so I tried Basic by Dial. Attention everyone...this is the SAME SOAP. So don&#x27;t waste your money on the jerks trying to price gouge you on the old pure and natural by dial.</li>
    <li> Expensive but so necessary.  This is the only soap that my 93 year old mother can use because of her allergies.</li>
    <li> Read the back of the soap folks. There isn&#x27;t anything in this &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; that&#x27;s really good for your skin. Most of you are probably suffering from dry skin, not an allergy or sensitivity.  Look for an all natural soap that is fragrance and color free. Note: titanium dioxide is a colorant (it&#x27;s white). Real color free soap will probably be an off white or cream color.  It should contain hypoallergenic, yet moisturizing oils like olive and coconut (coconut is not a nut).  Stay away from things like sodium laurel sulfate (makes soap bubble, but can be an irritant), deodorants, and preservatives. Your best bet is buying an all natural handmade soap (from a local farmer&#x27;s market or local retailer).  There are also a ton of handmade soaps on the Internet.  Most commercial soap isn&#x27;t going to be as good as handmade soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal rant: Stay away from palm oils. Palm oil is a cheap filler oil and palm oil plantations can devastate the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients for a basic bar of soap - idea for someone suffering from allergies or sensitivities would read something like: Olive oil, coconut oil, water, sodium hydroxide.  Soap isn&#x27;t all that complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, here are the ingredients on the back of the Dial Basics soap (Yikes):&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Cocoate or Palm Kernelate, Sodium Palmate, Sodium Tallowate (Contains One or More of These Ingredients)), Water, Talc, Coconut Acid, Palm Acid, Tallow Acid, Palm Kernel Acid (Contains One or More of These Ingredients), Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum), Sorbitol, Sodium Chloride, Pentasodium Penetate, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because it says dermatologist tested doesn&#x27;t mean the dermatologist said it was good...just means they tested it. ;)</li>
    <li> This soap has a very strong smell. It will run me out of the house. Do not know how they can say something is HypoAllergenic and has a fragrance so strong. Wasted my money on this soap. It is a dirty trick that they have pulled on the public. I really thought better of Dial and have used their products for many years, but no more. We have split the blanket over this.&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase the basis (not Basics) sensitive skin bar soap also and it is a real hit. Do not notice a fragrance with it and it does the job.</li>
    <li> The soap I received had a stronger scent than any soap I&#x27;ve ever used, including those that don&#x27;t claim to be unscented. If you are allergic to fragrances, save your money</li>
    <li> We had hoped something called basic and hypoallergenic would have no aroma or at least a mild one but this has one of the strongest scents of any soap we have tried and it is an awful artifical floral smell.  My husband gets migraines from fragrances but it seems impossible to find an unscented soap that isnt&#x27; $5 a bar!  This is definitely not it.</li>
    <li> This is not the same as the Pure and Natural which contained no perfume.  There was nothing in the description to alert me to this and I am severely allergic to perfume.  I ordered and can&#x27;t use.  I&#x27;m sneezing from opening the package.  Hypoallergenic it isn&#x27;t!!!  What a rip-off and what a gyp Dial!  If you are allergic to perfume, DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> this hard to find soap is great for sensitive skin /o spending a bunch of money. My skin became sensitive last fall due to a posion oak encounter and I could&#x27;t use my regular soap. This soap is great in my shower and the cost is very reasonable</li>
    <li> Best soap for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Maybe it is expecting too much for a \\&quot;Hypoallergenic\\&quot; soap to be fragrance free, but I don&#x27;t think so. There are a lot more people who are starting to have allergic reactions to all the chemicals in perfumes and other fragrances in assorted items, including soap. My mother has very severe reactions and it is getting harder to find decent unscented items. If you look at the ingredients for this soap \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; is right there in the middle. All in all that makes this NOT HYPOALLERGENIC.</li>
    <li> I first met this bar soap a few years ago as \\&quot;pure &amp; natural.\\&quot; It&#x27;s a great *basic* hand or complexion soap: bright white that doesn&#x27;t crack; silky smooth feel; light, fresh scent; washes off easily with no residue. For anyone who&#x27;s typically allergic to soaps and detergents, it probably would be fine for getting clean in tub or shower, too. Although that&#x27;s not usually me, in the past I have gotten a skin rash from some laundry detergents and from a few some soap bars, and Dial Basic caused no such reaction.</li>
    <li> Thought this would not be filled with fragrance, because fragrance is NOT hypoallergenic ever...don&#x27;t care what anyone may try to tell you. This has fragrance and I could not use it, had to give it away. Would not recommend this to anyone who is super sensitive.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this product, in conjunction with hypoallergenic deodorant, have helped me tremendously.  Its basic soap, but that&#x27;s all most of us are looking for.</li>
    <li> I break out from EVERYTHING!  I can&#x27;t use Dove or any of the other soaps that claim to be for sensitive skin.  Or I&#x27;ll start using a so-called sensitive skin soap - then my skin becomes irritated later.  Dial Basics is the only soap I&#x27;ve used that has not irritated my skin. I have begun hoarding the soap because I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be able to find it one day.  I&#x27;ve noted other reviewers comments that the soap is already discontinued.  I figure I&#x27;ll need to appeal to the company directly to keep it!!</li>
    <li> Very disheartening to have sensitive skin and not be able to find any affordable soap to use. Except for Dove, Dial Basics, which used to be Pure and Natural, is the only soap I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t break out my skin.  Only wish this product was still being manufactured.</li>
    <li> These are SCENTED and should not be labeled hypoallergenic!  If you are sensitive to fragrances STAY AWAY from this soap!</li>
    <li> I bought this because i can&#x27;t get it anywhere else.  I love this because i use hypoallergenic soap alot of the time.  I had to start using this because i used to buy pure &amp; natural &amp; i love it but when they stopped selling it i had no choice but to find something else &amp; this was it.</li>
    <li> I found this soap in a dispenser at a restaurant and loved the smell so much I came to amazon to buy my own. It has a light scent similar to what you&#x27;d find in a hotel room soap. I love it. Not too strong. Works great.</li>
    <li> Dial Basics is a very nice soap.  Much cheaper then other soaps out there.  I would definitly not spend $2.89 PLUS $4.80 shipping.  No soap is worth that.  Most stores that sell this sell it for less then $1.59</li>
    <li> This is the only soap that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin with a dry feeling. It also doesn&#x27;t leave any odor which always seems to bother me.</li>
    <li> A lifesaver for those of us with super sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product gets me clean with no film or residue and has no strong deoderant smell. Needed it Love it.</li>
    <li> this is great soap for sensitive  skin</li>
    <li> We have used Dial soap for more years than I want to admit, but in the last few years the antibiotic variety coupled with the hard water in our new house was drying and seemed harsh. This bar is perfect without too much in the way of chemicals. Nice fragrance of clean soap without perfume. It rinses well in the hardest water.</li>
    <li> Nice basic bar soap, no fancy creams or perfumes.</li>
    <li> This is our go to soap as we have allergies. The soap is priced great, wish we could find it in the store. Rinses clean leaves no residue and you feel clean after using it.</li>
    <li> Bought this soap since I have eczema on my hands and thought the hypoallergenic would help.  I also bought the same brand soap in liquid pump form.  The bar soap has such a strong fragrance!  I guess for washing your body it would be ok (though I haven&#x27;t tried) but on my hands it was terrible.  It gave me a headache it was so strong and lingering on my hands!  My whole bathroom smelled like this soap after I left an open bar in the sink cabinet.  The liquid pumps have a much milder fragrance but was also still too annoying for me.  Both the bar and liquid soap dried out my hands which defeated my purpose for buying.  I will be going back to my aloe vera moisturizing soap.</li>
    <li> Works well, but the most offputting thing to me is the smell.  It smells very clinical.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Basics&amp;#34; is NOT the same as &amp;#34;Pure &amp; Natural.&amp;#34; I used P&amp;N for a decade, and if I had known Dial was going to discontinue the brand, I would have bought a lifetime&#x27;s supply. &amp;#34;Basics&amp;#34; is perfumed and has a slick feel to it which is unpleasant. I WANT MY PURE &amp; NATURAL BACK!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking all over for the perfect bar of facial soap for my sensitive skin. The difficulty is finding &#x27;gentle&#x27; but &#x27;able to really clean&#x27; as well. This does both and smells great as well. Wouldn&#x27;t want to live without it.</li>
    <li> Bought thinking that this would be the perfect product for my super sensitive skin. Boy was I wrong!!! The first thing I noticed was the super strong scent. The first indication of not being for sensitive skin. Anyhow, I tried it and did I suffer for it. After 1 shower with this soap, my skin became inflamed and unbelievable itchy!!! I itched for about 20mins and had to take an antihistamine to calm the inflammation. Clearly, this soap is not for people who are hypoallergenic. Dial needs to remove the false advertising from the soap!!!</li>
    <li> this was a great soap for both my hubby and i...until it started sticking to the tub and clogged the drain guard causing a bath like effect while we are taking showers. not going to buy again! and there are fragrances, probably from the stuff they use, but still not good for someone who truly sensitive skin! look elsewhere!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference between this soap and regular dial soap. I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re the same soap, just branded differently. When looking for hypoallergenic, that usually means without a fragrance. This has a very strong fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they are a little pricier on Amazon. If you have any dollar stores around you, you&#x27;ll find the three pack for a dollar a piece there.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap.  It doesn&#x27;t make you itch, and isn&#x27;t perfumed. There is a very slight scent, but it is a soap scent, not perfume, and goes away while you&#x27;re rinsing.  It&#x27;s very gentle, suds up well, rinses off well, and leaves your skin feeling good.  (If you want to wear some perfume, it doesn&#x27;t have to battle with your soap!)  If you can&#x27;t find it in a store, you can order it on-line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very allergic to most soaps, breaking out in a rash, so I was thrilled to find the Dial Basics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My grandmother has always used bar on her face, and has tried liquid gels made especially for the face. She doesn&#x27;t care for them. It took some doing to find a soap she didn&#x27;t have an allergic reaction to.  She is happy with this soap, I am just glad to be able to find it here. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  I first spotted it in the discount store and decided to try it. How could you beat 3 bars of soap for $1.00!  I do not have sensitive skin, so I cannot attest to the hypo allergenic claim. However, I can attest to the fact that is makes my skin feel fresh, clean and not weighed down. I use it as a facial and hand soap and just love it.</li>
    <li> Despite the conflicting information this soap is not without a moderately strong floral scent, like lavender. Nice soap at a good price if you like the scent but if you&#x27;re looking for one without a scent this ain&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> This product is worth purchasing online.  I can no longer find it in stores.  It has a nice clean, practically odorless, smell and for those like me with perfume allergies, it is the perfect product for everyday use.</li>
    <li> When a bar of soap looked like a bar of soap and lasted more than two weeks. The smell even reminds me of soap from when I was a kid, back in the 60s. I just happened to find some at a dollar store and the size seemed right for traveling - that was really the main reason I picked some up. Now I&#x27;m sold, I want more! It has a pleasant smell and after about 30 showers there&#x27;s still some left (about 20%) from that first bar - good mileage. Hypoallergenic is a plus, but I&#x27;ve only reacted to a couple of soaps in my life so it wasn&#x27;t key. My skin seems to like it just fine.</li>
    <li> Live this sensitive skin soap!!!</li>
    <li> This soap now irritates my skin. I tried the replacement soap and it gave me a rash. So much for hypoallergenic soap.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s hypoallergenic but the soap cleans.  Lot&#x27;s of choices in soap and I use price as a criteria.  All grocery stores sell soap.  So I decide on my purchase based on price.  Amazon has variable prices in soap so check carefully.</li>
    <li> This super dried out my skin and I had MORE sensitivity issue with it. At least I was clean??</li>
    <li> Admittedly the only reason I purchased this was due to having a couple which when doubled basically gave me the soap free.  Figuring this would be another bar soap that would end up placed in a drawer, I could not have been more wrong.  This soap is so fresh smelling and leaves your skin with no slimy soap scum.  I will be going today to buy enough bars should Dial decide to do what happens so often and that is to pull their best products making them impossible to find.  For anyone looking for a hypoallergenic bar soap that lives up to its name, this is the one.</li>
    <li> I am one of those people who was using the dial &amp;#34;pure &amp; natural&amp;#34; bar soaps as long as I could get my hands on them. I saw some people making comparisons and thought I&#x27;d try this, encouraged by the extreme affordability. It&#x27;s okay soap, but I don&#x27;t think it compares very much to the great texture and scents of the former &amp;#34;pure and natural&amp;#34; bar soaps.</li>
