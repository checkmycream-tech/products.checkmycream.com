### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>We bought the Snazaroo kit and the ones in there are great.</li>
      <li>These sponges are great for applying Snazaroo makeup.  </li>
      <li>These sponges aren&#x27;t very nice on the skin, but they do the trick and they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
      <li>The products ordered were sponges, brushes and colors and all were the quality that was desired for safe and healthy face painting!</li>
      <li>have been using Snazaroo makeup for more than a decade and have found that for creating quick faces for either face painting at a fair or turning out hordes of zombies for a halloween trail or zombie walk.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You need more to hang on to.  </li>
      <li>the price is great, it is really nice to be able to use a fresh sponge on each new face.</li>
      <li>great and colorful face paints are exactly as described online</li>
      <li>They work best when they are damp, not soaking wet.  </li>
      <li>you need a large quantity of tiny sponges for kids to play with makeup - then they are OK. :)</li>
      <li>Quarter sized, and very flimsy.</li>
      <li>Small little things perfect for face painters</li>
      <li>and you can&#x27;t get enough paint  on the sponge to work quickly</li>
      <li>I thought these would be high quality foam.</li>
      <li>They are a nice small size for a child&#x27;s face or any small area and they are a good way to maintain sanitary conditions by tossing them and using a new one for the next child.</li>
      <li>Instead, they are thin, flimsy very cheaply made foam circles that can only be used once, at the most.</li>
      <li>Good for covering a face with one colour but not great for edging.</li>
      <li>They soak up much too much product and they go flat upon gentle pats.</li>
      <li>While the size is good for tiny jobs, and I suppose it can work in those occasions, its really not good for large areas - you will end up with your fingers colored as well.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>In fact, I already did place a new order for new colors.</li>
      <li>I think it would be better if they made these a half sponge but the same size.</li>
      <li>If you are a professional face painter - don&#x27;t bother.</li>
      <li>I bought these for a face painting job I did and they are perfect for adding areas of base color.</li>

<li> I bought these for a face painting job I did and they are perfect for adding areas of base color.</li>
<li> When looking at the picture I thought they were a lot bigger but apparently not.</li>
<li> The only thing they are good for is putting on a base color of face paint.</li>
<li> Overpriced,  flimsy,  alot smaller than i expected.</li>
<li> Much smaller than expected.</li>
<li> musch smaller than I expected</li>
<li> Not worth the money for proper face painting needs.</li>
<li> Snazaroo makes bigger sponges which I cut in half and use for split cakes, I figured those were the sponges I was buying in bulk.  </li>
<li> They are big enough that you can use them to quickly cover a face in a base coat, but small enough that you can use them for blending, detail work, and creating texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> They are about the size of a dime and not worth even opening to use.</li>
<li> They do no look like the picture, and they are the size of a half a dollar coin.</li>
<li> Too small, is not what I expected!</li>
<li> Used for small split cake designs and it worked out but held a lot of paint and was not worth washing to reuse.</li>
<li> These are junk, the size of a quarter less than half an inch thick.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s not comfortable to work with there small sponges.</li>
<li> They are too small.</li>
<li> Not very good to use for face painting...</li>
<li> For face painting, I like to cut the sponge in half to use it &amp; these were a bit too small &amp; thin.</li>
<li> they are too small and too thin, so the paint bleed through it.</li>
<li> About 1/2 inch thick and the size of a quarter!</li>
<li> too thin too.</li>
<li> The sponge is too thin and the paint seeps through.</li>
<li> Very thin and don&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
<li> Simply HORRIBLE.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t even bother with them, terrible quality!</li>
<li> The worst buy!</li>

    <li> THESE ARE MINI SPONGES! About 1/2 inch thick and the size of a quarter! Not very good to use for face painting...</li>
    <li> my granddaughter loves it</li>
    <li> Small little things perfect for face painters</li>
    <li> Simply HORRIBLE. Quarter sized, and very flimsy. They soak up much too much product and they go flat upon gentle pats. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> For over $10 this sponges are a joke!  Don&#x27;t even bother with them, terrible quality! Not for learning to do face paint.</li>
    <li> great and colorful face paints are exactly as described online and I will definitely reorder! In fact, I already did place a new order for new colors. The products ordered were sponges, brushes and colors and all were the quality that was desired for safe and healthy face painting!</li>
    <li> Much smaller than expected. Good for covering a face with one colour but not great for edging. Used for small split cake designs and it worked out but held a lot of paint and was not worth washing to reuse.</li>
    <li> If you are a professional face painter - don&#x27;t bother. The sponge is too thin and the paint seeps through.

    <li> Snazaroo makes bigger sponges which I cut in half and use for split cakes, I figured those were the sponges I was buying in bulk.  These are junk, the size of a quarter less than half an inch thick.  I&#x27;m going to try and return them.</li>
    <li> The worst buy! They do no look like the picture, and they are the size of a half a dollar coin. I will never purchase again.</li>
    <li> musch smaller than I expected</li>
    <li> Too small, is not what I expected! too thin too.</li>
    <li> I thought these would be high quality foam. Instead, they are thin, flimsy very cheaply made foam circles that can only be used once, at the most. Additionally, you can&#x27;t \\&quot;draw edges\\&quot; as they are so flimsy. The only thing they are good for is putting on a base color of face paint. Would NOT recommend to a fried.</li>

    <li> I did not like these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact when I got them I sent them back. They are about the size of a dime and not worth even opening to use. When looking at the picture I thought they were a lot bigger but apparently not. Not worth the money for proper face painting needs. I would not recommend purchasing these.</li>
    <li> They are too small. You need more to hang on to.  Speed is the thing and you can&#x27;t get enough paint  on the sponge to work quickly</li>
