<li> It is quite messy to fool with.  </li>
<li> Just a waste!</li>
<li> When 30 minutes was annoying for me, then 2 to 5 hours would be positively unbearable.  </li>
<li> Hard to use mask tear apart</li>

    <li> Just a waste! Not only was this messy it didn&#x27;t do anything! I tried it several times and if anything it made my skin look worse.</li>
    <li> This Mask was given to me as a gift and I did not use it for a while , then for some event I needed to look good and I did not have time to take care of my face, then I remembered the mask and I gave it a try.  Followed the instruction and apply the mask. My skin become firmer hydrated and luminous , Every one at the party commented that I look very fresh and rested which was a great compliment for me</li>
    <li> Hard to use mask tear apart</li>
    <li> Good product, skin looks like silk</li>
    <li> These masks are amazing. My skin glows after use. I try to use them weekly.</li>
    <li> definitely helped bring down some inflammation in my face......need to give it a few more go&#x27;s before i know for sure if it works. But the ingrediants are very healthy for the skin and mostly organic....I like to pamper my skin here and there because i put my skin through alot with the makeup usage! we shall see.....will keep using to see the full effect!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, left my face smooth and wrinkles plumped</li>
    <li> Didnt see much of a result.</li>
    <li> Very hydrating and soothing !</li>
    <li> I used the gold facial mask for the first time, what did I do wrong, it seems to be very big didn&#x27;t stick to my face at all kept falling off and how often do I use it once or three times a week and can I re use it like some people say?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for any help.</li>
    <li> These are always amazing!</li>
    <li> I like this product - it cleans and clears my skin. i love the smoothness and brightness this product leaves on my face after using it for just 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> Not  impressed  With the product..</li>
    <li> I have used this mask and I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon (was cheaper also) but i digress..This product truly does work. Last nite a did another beauty facial using the Dermaroller and placed this mask on my face and Wow my skin and face looked so good. I did keep it on my face longer than 30 minutes watching reality TV. I have under eye puffiness but not bags it is more on my cheek bone and it drives me crazy. It was noticeably smaller after removing the mask and m skin is so bright and smooth. Not that it matters but I am African American with pretty ok skin but wanted to beat the aging clock so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped. Since I didn&#x27;t by here I am posting the review under any vendor so people will know how good this product really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not work for Amazon nor the seller I am just a satisfied customer of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the price here is way to high you can find much cheaper.</li>
    <li> When I ordered it I expected something different, but it&#x27;s excellent. This mask is consist with collagen and gold and it is very easy to use it.&lt;br /&gt;After treatment your face is watered and nourished, looks very fresh and young.</li>
    <li> These were very hydrating. I was concerned about it being drying and causing irritation. I would definitely recommend and I am grateful to use these in between the more expensive Lorion and Brilliance 24k face mask that we use. Ordering more as soon as I post this review:-)</li>
    <li> I bought these because they resembled Oro-Gold. Although I didn&#x27;t get the exact same results, for the price point I&#x27;d definitely recommend.  Good value based product</li>
    <li> These are amazing for anyone that has been in the sun or just wants a marvelous facial treatment. This is my second order - I&#x27;m really happy with this product and Amazon has a great price.</li>
    <li> Now you can have any ingredients you like in your product - but don&#x27;t omit them in the product description!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list here on Amazon doesn&#x27;t state any animal products, but on the package it says that it has fish collagen in it! I don&#x27;t want to put THAT on my face!! Yuck!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this mask does besides possibly hydrate your skin. I hope it has magic qualities I just haven&#x27;t understood yet. I like walking around the house poking my tongue out of the hole when I see my family. Either way this mask was reasonably priced and worth a try.</li>
    <li> Spent 60. on a facial. Wondered if I could find anything like it online. 5 for $13. Won&#x27;t be going back to the spa! These are exactly the same ones.</li>
    <li> i like it,but i thought it will make  my skin glow more .not bad but i need something stronger than this mask.</li>
    <li> Naysayers, read the product description and you can see it is legit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Goods I pay taxes in Thailand. Is genuine. Sent from Thailand. I&#x27;m contacted lawyer to file a Slander lawsuit in court and us Embassy .\\&quot;</li>
    <li> It is quite messy to fool with.  I&#x27;ve tried other masks like this and find them just as much - or maybe more effective.  Nothing special here.</li>
    <li> This was a big waste of MY money. This mask is very heavy and uncomfortable to wear.  I could only stand to do a 30 minute treatment.  To wear it for 30 minutes was absolutely annoying.  Maybe if I could see even a little results, I would continue to use them.  I&#x27;ve tried it twice and have 3 masks left and do not believe I will ever use those 3.  The direction say at least 30 minutes for the eyes but should be left on for 2 to 5 hours to get complete benefits.  When 30 minutes was annoying for me, then 2 to 5 hours would be positively unbearable.  Maybe if I could stand to have it on my face for 2 to 5 hours, I would see a difference.  But I simply cannot lay still that long without turning my head as I am uncomfortable lying on my back.  I couldn&#x27;t read or watch TV or even fall off to sleep while wearing the mask so I know I could not stand to have this wet, heavy, plastic mat on my face for 2 to 5 hours.</li>
    <li> I am one of those tourists who spent way too much on Graztiae products while in Las Vegas.  But they were luxurious and I liked them.  I found them here on Amazon and now can afford my \\&quot;habit.\\&quot;  This gold mask was an item I experienced during my facial and couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about it. The price they quoted was too high... When I found it on Amazon, I could afford to buy them.  With one use for EACH side, I am in heaven.  The product is light and cool to the touch.  I splurge and lay down with it on.  I really see a difference in my skin afterwards and during the time I have it on it feels sooo sensual and relaxing. If you buy this 5 pack - that is ten \\&quot;experiences of beauty.\\&quot;  Herbal ingredients make it safe and inviting.  Indulge.  I may just buy all of them before anyone else gets there....</li>
    <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Speed ​​the arrival of of the product did not expect to get it in record time after the payment and good results</li>
    <li> When I first use it, it made my face so comfortable. I suggest you buy it to try if it good for you</li>
    <li> Very good product. recommend</li>
    <li> I much like. My skin becomes very soft and much smooth. Looks fresh and young. I Shall recommend my girlfriend</li>
    <li> Came quickly and as described</li>
