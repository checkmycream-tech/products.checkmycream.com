      <li>That being said, this product is the best of the many I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>That is why we almost never use it, but when we do, it seems to be working, the smell is quite pleasant.</li>

      <li>Oklahoma mosquitoes loved it and chewed me up.</li>
      <li>This is a good bug spray.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, works great and no harmful chemicals.  </li>

      <li>This stuff worked fairly well, might have even been more effective against ticks than SSS.</li>
      <li>It does have a very strong odor, which my husband does not like.  </li>
      <li>This one works best by far.  </li>

      <li>Was ok for me, but baby still got many, many bites.</li>
      <li>Really works great - everyone who used it camping did not get bitten.</li>
      <li>I feel safe using this product because I know the ingredients come from plants and not chemicals.  </li>
      <li>It will help and it is safe so that is a bonus.</li>
      <li>These products have the most nauseating smell imaginable.</li>
      <li>Citronella may smell better</li>
      <li>the the more harsher smells.</li>
      <li>I love that it is all-natural.</li>
      <li>but it is more just herbal.  </li>
      <li>I more put off by the scent.  </li>
      <li>This might be the most foul smelling liquid I have ever</li>
      <li>Even the homemade repellant my friend concocted works better than this stuff.</li>
      <li>EcoSmart Insect Repellant is also organic, has a pleasant odor, and good golly it actually works!</li>
      <li>I prefer not to slather them over my own body and absolutely WILL NOT use them on my grand kids!   </li>
      <li>Works pretty good but</li>
      <li>The smell is strong, but citronella smell is much more tolerable.</li>
      <li>My 7 yr old takes a bottle to camp every day and he is so happy to not be getting bitten up.  </li>
      <li>We are now able to enjoy the outdoors with almost no bug bites, which is truly miraculous.</li>
      <li>The ingredients are all natural and it seems to work great.</li>
      <li>so you must keep shaking as you spray or you will not get enough of the good stuff on you!)  </li>
      <li>Spray outdoors, because it is strong upon spraying, but</li>
      <li>teaspoons of Insect Shield oil blend (this is a strong mix)&lt;br /&gt;Shake</li>
      <li>The smell can kill any insect and will stay on even after a strong bath.</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons of Insect Shield oil blend (this is a strong mix) Shake well and keep shaking as you spray</li>
      <li>These actually work pretty good for mosquitoes in Amarillo TX area, however they aren&#x27;t very effective against aggressive biting flies around here.</li>
      <li>I found this product to be pretty effective, but some people are put off by the castor oil smell.</li>
      <li>I usually use SSS with alcohol, which is the best, and most cost-effective to my knowledge.</li>
      <li>But I feel fine using this</li>
      <li>This actually kept mosquitoes and gnats away from me, and has a much more pleasant smell than DEET products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>The bug spray works great, especially for a non-deet product.</li>
      <li>I purchased it because it is DEET free and organic, which are two things that are important to me, so I will continue to use it.  </li>
      <li>It not only stops bites from no-seeums in the tropics, but it is great relief for any I do get.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know the ratios of the different oils in it, but decided to give it a try and am happy with the results.</li>
      <li>I wanted a deet free product for my toddlers.</li>
      <li>this is a fantastic option.</li>
      <li>It works well on the areas where it is applied (until we sweat it off), but it does not extend beyond the sprayed area to create a &amp;#34;bug free zone&amp;#34; of any sort, i.e. if you spray your hair, neck, shoulders and chest, but not your face, they will land and bite your face.</li>
      <li>The scent is strong, but not entirely unpleasant, with the primary scent being citronella.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure I hadn&#x27;t applied this in well over 8 hours and</li>
      <li>Clean smell,</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does leave an oily film on whatever it is sprayed on, so clean up when you&#x27;re done playing</li>
      <li>The arrival of the goods at the very quickly, but we haven&#x27;t started, I believe it is useful to us</li>
      <li>It does smell a bit strong (geranium oil) but it&#x27;s worth it, knowing that I&#x27;m not spritzing a toxic chemical on my (and my daughter&#x27;s) skin.</li>
      <li>so you must keep shaking as you spray or you will not get enough of the good stuff on you!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Will be bringing Bite Blocker with me to St. Maarten this summer and use it on the whole family including our toddler son. &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>non-oily and one good spray (it&#x27;s actually a pump) kept us bug-free for hours.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>I feel comfortable that the ingredients are deet free, safe enough to use every day and can be applied to his face.  </li>
      <li>For example, during black fly season here in New England, I can work in my garden for a good 30-45 minutes without bother before I reapply to sensitive spots.  </li>
      <li>Totally worth it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> works great.  The smell is not so great</li>
    <li> Smells disgusting and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> My whole family loves Bite Blocker.  It smells nice, works great and no harmful chemicals.  I have tried several products but this is the one to beat!  My 7 yr old takes a bottle to camp every day and he is so happy to not be getting bitten up.  Love it!</li>
    <li> The bug spray works great, especially for a non-deet product. The spray is almost like a thin lotion when first applied, which I found a little surprising but more effective in the time length of coverage than most non-deet bug sprays. The spray works for about 3-4 hours when the mosquitoes are thick (swarms of a 50+ mosquitoes). The spray does have an odd scent. Depending on your preferences you might say its a good or bad smell. I found it an odd smell but not repugnant.</li>
    <li> This is the only bug spray our family uses. Why use DEET when this is at least as effective? We&#x27;ve used it for a number of years now in all sorts of buggy situations and found that it works very well for all of our family members. Last summer I was in a particularly mosquito-infested wooded area with a group of friends who had used a very well known DEET product and they were getting TONS of bites. My son and I got none. I don&#x27;t mind the smell--it&#x27;s bug spray, not perfume, and I don&#x27;t like how the DEET sprays smell either. Citronella may smell better but I don&#x27;t find it to work well. If you are concerned about West Nile or EEE but also concerned about DEET this is a fantastic option.</li>
    <li> I wanted a deet free product for my toddlers. I tried this for a trip to Mn. We were in a deep woods area.  This product smells horrible (like what I would imagine rotten garlic would smell like) The smell does not fade. My children were swarmed &amp; bitten by every kind of bug with this on. It seemed to attract them! I seriously had to run into our cabin with my kids &amp; when inside I had to pick off deer flies from my son&#x27;s head (a very dangerous-nasty bug to be bit by) I immediately gave them a bath to get the product off.  We were forced to run into town &amp; buy a deet product. My husband still jokes about the \\&quot;bug attractant\\&quot; I put on the kids.  Skip this product!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before buying this and thought, \\&quot;wow, a natural product that seems to really work.\\&quot;  But don&#x27;t be fooled...it doesn&#x27;t work.  As my husband said, \\&quot;You might as well throw water on yourself to keep the bugs away!\\&quot;  We were attacked by mosquitoes at Crater Lake and this stuff did nothing to stop them.  We also had some of the Repel Lemon Eucalyptus that seemed to work a little better...at least for a couple minutes.  Thank goodness we had some \\&quot;real\\&quot; bug spray or else we wouldn&#x27;t have survived our trip.  Save your money and go for the DEET.</li>
    <li> Review of insect repellent, deet-free, natural insect repellant        This stuff worked fairly well, might have even been more effective against ticks than SSS. Like most natural sprays it has a \\&quot;potent\\&quot; aroma to it, but personally I much prefer it to the chemical smells. The DEET products I have used in the past did not work any better! I noticed that for biting flies, adding alcohol to this mixture semed to help out a bit, but may have made re-applications even more frequent. I usually use SSS with alcohol, which is the best, and most cost-effective to my knowledge. If you are really serious about not being bitten, and go through bottles of bug spray too quickly, research BUG-TAMERZ!</li>
    <li> Although this product does well at repelling insects (if you are good at re-applying often), the scent is SO DISGUSTING that I am returning both bottles that I purchased. I cannot even describe the scent...it is just awful. And it is hard to get the scent off, even after washing once you are indoors. I do not recommend this product at all, unless you have no scent glands. HORRIBLE.</li>
    <li> Works a little better than skin so soft and almost as good as OFF or Cutter&#x27;s.  Has a pleasant odor, but you have to put a lot on and not miss ANY exposed skin.  I don&#x27;t like the bottle though.  It leaks if not kept upright.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a recent camping trip.  While it seemed to do its job of warding off insects, the scent of the spray was overwhelming and flat-out disgusting.  It (and therefore I) reeked like something decaying.  I couldn&#x27;t handle the foul odor combined with the dirt and dust of camping.      I was grateful that I had bought another deet-free repellent (California Baby with citronella) at the last minute which seemed to do the job with a more pleasant scent and less of a grimy feeling after application.</li>
    <li> This is the only bug/tick spray that we&#x27;ve tried that was deet-free that works. We ran out of this stuff late last year and forgot to order some before spring. Before we knew it, I found three ticks on myself and two on my son after several hikes in the Poconos. (Let along a score of bug bites.) Since purchasing the spray, no ticks and very few bug bites can be found on myself or my kids. No one wants to expose his or her children to unnecessary chemicals, but one also doesn&#x27;t want them to be bitten by bugs and ticks. This is spray is the answer to what we&#x27;ve been looking for! What can I say besides it works.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading the other reviews that stated it smells, figuring I&#x27;d just have to judge for myself. Well it stinks so bad that I could not bring myself to use it on me or my 2 year old boys. I really wanted it to work out since it got great reviews by Consumer Reports, but even they stated it had a smell. As far as the effectiveness of the product, I can only assume ticks and bugs would want to steer clear of you (along with everyone else!!). I returned it to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for a trip to Costa Rica where I would be camping and hiking in the rainforest for a couple of days.  My boyfriend had 30% deet repellant and his ankles were covered with ticks when we finished.  I maybe had 2.  You do have to reapply every 1.5-2 hours but I feel this is normal with any product in a hot outdoor environment where you are constantly sweating.  If you want chemical free, I would highly recommend Bite Blocker.</li>
    <li> I have not purchased this product but have smelled it on others. It makes me ill, and even outdoors I have to get away from anyone using products containing Geraniol, or Geranium oil. Also Geranium oil, and Geraniol carry the same health hazard as DEET. You can look up the Material Data Safety Sheet and see for yourself, Geraniol and Geranium are both listed as eye nose and throat irritants.  furthermore Geranium Oil, and Geraniol have never been scientifically tested to determine long term toxic effects because it comes from nature. Well nature produces some substances just as toxic as man made chemicals, dont kid yourself that \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;Organic\\&quot; products are any less harmful to you and your family.</li>
    <li> I bought this product planning to put it on my 3 month old baby. We had a cookout over the weekend and I was so excited to try my new bug repellent. Well, it smells like soured laundry. It is bad. Everyone joked that the bugs stayed away because of the stench. What is worse, I am not sure it did much good. I am very tasty to bugs in general and I still have about 15 bites from being outside with my guests. (We also had 5 tiki torches lit with citronella oil) I am going to keep searching.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been comfortable using deet on my now 4 year old, and I&#x27;ve pretty much tried every alternative on the market.  This one works best by far.  The only thing I&#x27;ve found is that it must be reapplied often to work well.  My backyard is heavily populated with mosquitos, and this one even repels asian tigers if applied liberally and once every hour or so.  This is the one to use if you don&#x27;t like using deet!</li>
    <li> It is not just the rather unpleasant odor, which makes this product stink -- it is ineffective. I am not expecting it to be a great chigger repellant, but it does not work against mosquitoes. I spray inordinate amounts on my legs before I step outside and I come in with bites where I have virtually bathed in the stuff. There are much more effective DEET-free repellants: EcoSmart Insect Repellant is also organic, has a pleasant odor, and good golly it actually works! Even the homemade repellant my friend concocted works better than this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product seemed to work ok.  I more put off by the scent.  I will probably try another brand before repurchasing this again.</li>
    <li> This bug spray works, plain and simple. I refuse to use DEET on myself and my baby, and in the woods of SW Michigan, where we live, we were unable to even leave our house this summer, due to the rainy, warm conditions that bred an onslaught of mosquitoes and flies. We are now able to enjoy the outdoors with almost no bug bites, which is truly miraculous. Either different people process this scent differently, or some of the other reviewers are just being ridiculous, because this spray is not that bad at all. I&#x27;ve smelled a LOT worse things in my life, and after about 20 minutes, the scent is nearly gone anyways. Some of my friends say it smells like moldy towels; but like I said, it really doesn&#x27;t bother me or my husband that much at all. I think moth balls, cigarette smoke, and garbage cans smell way worse!</li>
    <li> I truly believe that all insect repellents act differently according to the user&#x27;s skin type &amp; tried almost every one. Some worked for a short time while others not at all.  I wanted something &#x27;deet free&#x27; for my granddaughter who is plagued by mosquitos at the Jersey Shore and has sensitive skin;  read the description of this product, and gave it a try. It worked! Clean smell, non-oily and one good spray (it&#x27;s actually a pump) kept us bug-free for hours. Will stock up for the summer.</li>
    <li> The spray nozzle did not work when I opened it.  Tried running hot water through it figuring it was clogged. Still didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, we had a bad experience after our first use with Bite Blocker.  My daughter and I were at camp with about 24 other people and went on a 1.5 hr hike. My daughter and I BOTH had 10 ticks crawling on us after using this product. We had more than anyone. I try to stay away from DEET, but may spray our shoes with it next time. Otherwise, I will stick with some other natural repellants. This clearly didn&#x27;t work for us!</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my toddler and found this item to be effective but smelly. The smell can kill any insect and will stay on even after a strong bath. Anyone can smell you from a distance.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the seller I purchased from mixed this stuff themselves because there ws noo seal.I am a camper and have been in my share of  out houses and porta jons so I am not sqeemish.This stuff smells so bad.so bad.I put two sprays on my arm and had to wash it off and I am not exaterating but I am still nausious.No one likes smelling like deet but it beats feeling sick.This seller was charging 99 cents.I hope Amazon looks into this or mabe it is just a terrible product..BUYER BEWARE!!!!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product after spending a week in the woods where there were a LOT of mosquitoes and ticks. I did end up with a tick on me during the week but I&#x27;m pretty sure I hadn&#x27;t applied this in well over 8 hours and many other people there had multiple ticks. So, I&#x27;d say this was a winner. I also applied a lot of NEEM oil to my skin after taking a baby wipe bath in the woods so that might have helped too. I really liked the way the NEEM oil smelled so it balanced this smell out nicely and I actually got complimented many times over how nice I smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good luck ppl.</li>
    <li> I always feel a little sick when I have used insect repellent, even the kinds that do not have d.e.e.t. But I feel fine using this and it works.</li>
    <li> I have tried every \\&quot;natural\\&quot; repellant on the market and this is easily the best if have used. I have tried  products with a vanilla base, pepermint base, and catnip base. Most of these went away quickly because they simply didn&#x27;t work. Most of the natural brands nowadays are combinations of citronella, lemon grass and eucalyptus and  they are fairly common. Burt&#x27;s Bees, NOW brand and others come to mind.  These actually work pretty good for mosquitoes in Amarillo TX area, however they aren&#x27;t very effective against aggressive biting flies around here.This product works better than others on mosquitoes(I guess we do not have the Asian Tiger) and WAY better against flies. It doesn&#x27;t smell that bad. Citronella and DEET smell funny for that matter. If these products smelled really good, they would probably attract bugs and would be called perfume. A word of caution: Most folks with any knowledge at all have become aware that DEET is harmful, especial for young kids whose brains are still developing. Lots of these same folks never think about the carrier chemicals used in name brand \\&quot;natural\\&quot; repellants. I have one from WallyWorld that has Di-n-propyl isocinchomeronate and N-Octyl bichloheptene dicarboximide for carrier chemicals. It also has \\&quot;inert ingredients\\&quot; that aren&#x27;t named. Scientists are starting to take a skeptical look at these carrier chemicals since they are not well  studied, especially in combination with the myriad of active ingredients with which they are frequently combined. I prefer not to slather them over my own body and absolutely WILL NOT use them on my grand kids!   Bite Blocker uses only food-grade plant-based ingredients including soybean oil and geranium oil and is rated \\&quot;safest for kids\\&quot; by ConsumerSearch(consumersearch.com). I prefer the lotion; a little more trouble to put on, less waste and more effective. Use the spray for touch ups.    It works good for us.</li>
    <li> Effective without scary chemicals. I even like the smell. It has a touch of an oily feel but I don&#x27;t ind cause its natural</li>
    <li> Was seriously hoping for an effective mosquito repellent, which sadly - this is not. First is attempting to get used to the soiled diaper smell, which I would suspect is what attracts the mosquitoes. I gave this product a good try and effort but found myself fighting off the mosquitoes and then quickly jumping into the shower to wash away the terrible odor of this product. Would not recommend this product to anyone who lives where real mosquitoes live.</li>
    <li> I tried this the next day after the related lotion and it doesn&#x27;t work, either.  Oklahoma mosquitoes loved it and chewed me up.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why people complain about the smell... it just smells like herbs. The ingredients are all natural and it seems to work great. My son goes to camp in the woods and he used to come back home with ticks... not since we&#x27;ve started using this spray. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I have a cabin in the woods and bugs of all kind are bad in the summer. Used this and it really works.  The one for you pets works also.</li>
    <li> I love the insect repellent but the &amp;#34;squirter&amp;#34; is not working at all with the result that I am using way to much. For such an expensive repellent that is amazing!</li>
    <li> Smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as other reviewers- was dreading to smell it- but it is more just herbal.  Works pretty good but in the Amazon jungle we couldn&#x27;t find anything that would keep those mosquitoes away.</li>
    <li> might as well be labeled cologne, eiher that or mosquitos are tougher my neck of the woods. ill take DEET over west nile, EEE.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem to keep mosquitoes away from us during morning walks through the woods. We have since found other natural products that do a much better job. It might have kept other bugs away (thus the 2 star instead of 1 star rating), but since mosquitoes are the primary issue for us, we will use a different product.</li>
    <li> This spray is effective and convenient to apply from the spray bottle. The initial odor is comparatively mild, but after a few hours the lingering odor is less pleasant. If this odor is not bothersome to you, or if you are in a position where you can wash off the spray within a few hours, then by all means this is a reasonable substitute for DEET-based repellants.</li>
    <li> I had no bites during the season while wearing this repellent. It smells good too.</li>
    <li> My son has some kind of mosquito allergy and swells from bites.  We used this every day in the summer and the only time he ever got a bite was when someone forgot to apply it.  I feel comfortable that the ingredients are deet free, safe enough to use every day and can be applied to his face.  Smells a little funny but what bug spray doesn&#x27;t?  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a good bug spray. I use it for my son. I haven&#x27;t seen any bugs on him when I use it. It does stink though.</li>
    <li> This stuff may work but it really smells horrible!  It made me want to gag and my husband wouldn&#x27;t go near me.  Neither did the mosquitos though, so I guess it works...</li>
    <li> The solution is great. I am usually a mosquito magnet, but no bites while I am wearing this stuff.  My only complaint is the spray bottle stopped spraying within days so I did have to buy a replacement bottle.</li>
    <li> It did not prevent us from being bitten. At all.</li>
    <li> Really works great - everyone who used it camping did not get bitten. It also smells decent which is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> Bought this for trip to visit family in South India (near coast) - not so good for baby and had to go with a local mosquito repellant cream (called Odomos) for him. I, however used it on myself - had to re-apply frequently and it felt very sticky - but then again, I was in humid S. Indian weather. Was ok for me, but baby still got many, many bites.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, nothing works like Deet. That being said, this product is the best of the many I&#x27;ve tried. The scent is strong, but not entirely unpleasant, with the primary scent being citronella. I put this on me an babe whilst trekking deep into the woods on a humid day, and the only time a bug comes near is around dusk. At feeding time for mosquitoes, I&#x27;d rate this product at 80% effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave an oily film on whatever it is sprayed on, so clean up when you&#x27;re done playing outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
    <li> This might be the most foul smelling liquid I have ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It states on the bottle \\&quot;pleasant fresh scent\\&quot;, sure, if your idea of that is sweaty arm pits then go ahead and douse yourself with this BIO smelling concoction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was so atrocious, it kept me awake all night.</li>
    <li> I have sprayed myself and my clothes with this product before going into the garden to work on my flower beds and it works a little but not enough to keep from being bit. Its the difference between 10 bites as opposed to 20.</li>
    <li> This seems to work, not particularly fond of the smell, but my daughter says it smells like menthol to her, so it must be different for me. Just make sure to really shake this to get it mixed well. It has a good oil base so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I use it on my children and it works better than most other natural repellents for mosquitoes, but it has a very strong smell which can be very unpleasant for teh user as well as other people 9depending on how sensitive they are to this particular smell).</li>
    <li> This is the best non-DEET insect repellent I&#x27;ve found.  Initially purchased at Walmart, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere for a long time and resorted to many other different products.  Some were good but I found them irritating in some way (i.e., smell or skin) upon application.  I was very happy to find it online through Amazon.  Bite Blocker has a nice feel to the skin and goes on easily from the pump top bottle.  As with many non-DEET products, you have to apply it often to maintain ultimate protection.  For example, during black fly season here in New England, I can work in my garden for a good 30-45 minutes without bother before I reapply to sensitive spots.  During normal buggy times it longevity is longer.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells SO awful.  I cannot fully describe how horrid it smells.  It honestly smells similar to a sweaty gym locker room that has a cedar sauna.  I have used cedar oil based repellants before and this smells much worse than those.  Both my wife and I rode home with the windows down anxious to get this off of us.  Really, it smells THAT bad.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! It has a lemon-grass type aroma which is so much easier on the senses the the more harsher smells. My dogs don&#x27;t even mind getting sprayed. But no more bites!</li>
    <li> We spray it on the kids clothes. Serves the purpose very well. The smell is bad, but manageable for us.</li>
    <li> I cannot attest to how well this works in keeping bugs at bay, because the moment I applied it (thankfully to myself and not my children) I began to gag. It smells like rancid vomit (and being a nurse and a mother of two children I am well versed in the smell of vomit) and I immediately ran into my sister&#x27;s house to try to wash it off. I tried soap, I tried hand sanitizer, I tried scrubbing with a wash cloth and soap, NOTHING helped. We ended up leaving the BBQ because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell and needed to shower immediately.</li>
    <li> Works so well. We lived in Tanzania for 3months and it kept away the mosquitoes. So long DEET!</li>
    <li> This smells absolutely awful. The smell even of the closed bottle sitting across a table makes me want to puke.  What a waste of money if you&#x27;re never going to put it on due to the smell.</li>
    <li> My husband attracts mosquitoes like honey attracts Winnie the Pooh and bites swell up on him into big welts, but he hates using Deet and other similarly toxic repellents.  With Bite Blocker we can finally go outside in the evening again.  We&#x27;ve actually seen mosquitoes fly around his arm looking for a place to land and then give up and fly away.  No bites since he started using it.</li>
    <li> The bottle we received is probably defective, it leaks and won&#x27;t spray at all. The label on the bottle says to use it while holding upside down, but it never works in any position and just leaks out. So it&#x27;s impossible to use it without having a small mess. That is why we almost never use it, but when we do, it seems to be working, the smell is quite pleasant. If the bottle were not defective I would be using it a lot.</li>
    <li> It stinks. Not sure how well it works because I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times. The smell is horrible. Pass the deet please-- I&#x27;d take that any day over this.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only Deet-free bug sprays that I could find that is also waterproof (a must for when kids are playing in the backyard sprinklers).  The smell isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as I had feared based on other reviews, and it&#x27;s protected the kids pretty well.  If I were to go somewhere with ticks or really heavy mosquitos, I would use something stronger, but for just your typical annoying backyard mosquitos, it&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> Works well on deer flies. Mosquitoes not as well. Took with us on a hike and had to keep spraying because the mosquitoes were relentless.  Spray outdoors, because it is strong upon spraying, but the smell didn&#x27;t bother me being on my skin.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe I have failed to rate this before. This stuff smells like rotting corpses and, guess what, bugs hate it! So will your girlfriend, but who cares, because you will not have multitudes of mosquitos tormenting your sorry self. It works better than any bug spray I have ever tried. You will stink. Be forewarned.</li>
    <li> I cannot stand the smell !! It repell me before the insect...&lt;br /&gt;And still, I tried it once but got bitten..so never used again.</li>
    <li> The bottle leaks pretty badly, but overall the smell is okay and it seems to work well.</li>
    <li> The organic label had me skeptical but if you can put up with a slightly offputting smell it will definitely get the job done&#x60;&#x60;</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF WORKS GREAT</li>
    <li> Works very well for Mosquitos &amp; flies!</li>
    <li> I purchased a bottle of this stuff a few years ago, and I absolutely love it. I can&#x27;t stand the smell of deet and I know it is terrible for you.  I feel safe using this product because I know the ingredients come from plants and not chemicals.  It does have a very strong odor, which my husband does not like.  The smell is like a bitter plant smell, not a perfume or chemical smell, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  My only complaint is that they no longer carry it at walmart and it is expensive online.</li>
    <li> I like all natural products like this for the grandkids. Nothing toxic.... I have purchased  this spray  several times and we do need it because we live in the Deep South where  insects thrive. I take it on vacation  too.</li>
    <li> The smell was so bad that I didn&#x27;t even put it on to see how affective it was. I&#x27;m returning it. \\&quot;Fresh scent\\&quot; is very misleading!</li>
    <li> I purchased this spray and the towelettes after reading positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot imagine how these reviews can be legit. These products have the most nauseating smell imaginable. My daughter was almost vomiting and was in tears after I sprayed this on her one morning before school. She was late because she had to wash so much in order to remove all trace of the odor from this repellent.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It not only stops bites from no-seeums in the tropics, but it is great relief for any I do get.</li>
    <li> The arrival of the goods at the very quickly, but we haven&#x27;t started, I believe it is useful to us</li>
    <li> One family member thinks it&#x27;s a little stinky, the rest of family are fine with the smell.  My wife has to wash her leggings after using Bite Bloacker Xtreme since it feels slightly tacky on them, but it&#x27;s not so tacky on cotton.</li>
    <li> This actually kept mosquitoes and gnats away from me, and has a much more pleasant smell than DEET products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about buying this because so many people complained of the &amp;#34;disgusting&amp;#34; smell. The smell definitely  isn&#x27;t pleasant (it&#x27;s bug spray!!) but it&#x27;s not bad. And I feel MUCH better about spraying this on my toddler (and myself!) since it&#x27;s so low on the skin deep scale</li>
    <li> I am a genuine mosquito magnet, once having counted 76 bites from taking just a single half-hour venture outside after a rainstorm while on vacation in Mexico.  Thus, while on a return trip to Mexico for my destination wedding this time I was not willing to take any chances!  In looking for a pleasant-smelling, non-toxic and all-natural alternative to the standard DEET bug repellents, I found the perfect product in Bite Blocker.  It works wonders!!!  For a week straight I sprayed Bite Blocker all over body and face before heading out and no mosquitoes bit me at all.  I even introduced the product to friends and family and everyone loved how great it smelled and how non-sticky it was.  I&#x27;ve never tried this product in a deep woods environment nor around the Asian Tiger mosquito (as far as I know) but can vouch that it works great even for a mosquito magnet like myself in the jungles of Mexico.  Will be bringing Bite Blocker with me to St. Maarten this summer and use it on the whole family including our toddler son. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Stops bug bites better than everything. And it does not contain DEET, so I feel safe giving it to my child. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> We live in South Florida where it is hot, humid and wet most of the year. We have a serious mosquito population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased several natural brands of mosquito repellant over the past couple of years and wanted to share my experience with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My least favorite is California Baby [[ASIN:B001ATGBNA California Baby Bug Repellant Spray, 6.5 Ounce]]. The California Baby repellant simply doesn&#x27;t work, even if I use a lot (spray enough that the skin is wet). There is no change in mosquito behavior with this product, they just keep coming, landing and biting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next is Buzzaway [[ASIN:B000OCMH9G Quantum Buzzaway, Extreme Spray, 4-Ounce]] It works better than the California Baby (which isn&#x27;t difficult), but is soy based and not recommended for small children. I will spray this on myself and my little one&#x27;s clothing (which is enough to keep the skeeters away), but not on his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bite Blocker [[ASIN:B000VV07L0 Bite Blocker Xtreme 6.70 Ounces]] Also soy based, but works better than the previous two and is all natural. Because of the soy, I don&#x27;t spray this on the baby&#x27;s skin, I spritz his clothing and shoes and the mosquitoes stay away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some research, I found this Insect Shield essential oil blend that has all the ingredients I was looking for. [[ASIN:B008N0PYB4 Nature Shield Synergy Essential Oil Blend. 30 ml (1 oz). 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade. (Blend Of: Citronella, Eucalyptus, Cedarwood, Lemongrass, Lavender, Litsea, Tea Tree, Patchouli &amp; Catnip).]]&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know the ratios of the different oils in it, but decided to give it a try and am happy with the results. It works well on the areas where it is applied (until we sweat it off), but it does not extend beyond the sprayed area to create a &amp;#34;bug free zone&amp;#34; of any sort, i.e. if you spray your hair, neck, shoulders and chest, but not your face, they will land and bite your face. Never-the-less, we reapply often and are still saving money with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my recipe:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 oz spray bottle&lt;br /&gt;Fill 3/4 with *alcohol based* witch hazel. I use this one [[ASIN:B00LBHBS1Q Thayers - Witch Hazel Astringent with Aloe Vera Formula Lemon - 12 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;2 teaspoons of Insect Shield oil blend (this is a strong mix)&lt;br /&gt;Shake well and keep shaking as you spray (the oil does not emulsify in this recipe/ it will keep floating to the top so you must keep shaking as you spray or you will not get enough of the good stuff on you!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried adding vegetable glycerine to the recipe, but there was no added benefit so I leave it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will save more money and go for the big bottle of Insect Shield next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading, I hope this review was helpful!ttle Fill 3/4 with *alcohol based* witch hazel.

Thanks for reading, I hope this review was helpful!</li>
    <li> Does it really work? This is nowhere as good as deet, but it is better than nothing. I would put it around those family bug sprays with like 5% deet. It will help and it is safe so that is a bonus.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work in Wisconsin. Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I was getting bites immediately after applying.  Our mosquitoes must be resistant.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells awful.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use one my children.  One evening in our yard resulted in no bug bites, but the smell is actually nauseating. We are using the Burt&#x27;s bees bug repellent instead.  The smell is strong, but citronella smell is much more tolerable.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased in preperation of a 2 week course in agriculture. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with bugs biting me and I thought the odor was not at all unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be pretty effective, but some people are put off by the castor oil smell. If you can stand it, the bugs don&#x27;t like the smell either!</li>
    <li> This kept the giant tropical mosquitoes in SE Asia and Central America at bay. I&#x27;m a customer for life! I love that it is all-natural. It does smell a bit strong (geranium oil) but it&#x27;s worth it, knowing that I&#x27;m not spritzing a toxic chemical on my (and my daughter&#x27;s) skin.</li>
    <li> Not as effective as DEET (at least for me)!</li>
    <li> Worked against mosquitos that bit through other natural sprays.  Doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy and slimy like some other brands.  You&#x27;ll want to shower at the end of the day, but not nearly as nauseating as some of the other scents out there.</li>
    <li> Very good product - but where is the expiration date ?</li>
    <li> I have only used it once so far, just received it.  It does seem to work, but the smell will take a little getting use to.  I rubbed it on my skin and it gave me a headache and I felt a little sick to my stomach from the smell.  After being outside for a while I didn&#x27;t notice the smell so much and the bugs did stay away.  I purchased it because it is DEET free and organic, which are two things that are important to me, so I will continue to use it.  I&#x27;m sure in time I will get use to the smell, it is somewhat herbal, but the combination of the different oils and scents is a strange smell, rather hard to describe.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product because we had used this brand and liked it, but the bottles we received were rancid and unuseable. Ordered it prior to running out of the product, so did not realize the 2 bottle were bad until after the return date expired. (Would not think to check to see if a bug spray was good or not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a waste of money and felt you needed to know the product received from you was bad. Check your inventory.</li>
