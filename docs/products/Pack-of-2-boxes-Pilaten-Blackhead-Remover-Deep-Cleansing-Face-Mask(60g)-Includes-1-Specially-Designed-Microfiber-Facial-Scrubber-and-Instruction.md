      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>It was good</li>
      <li>, i am very satisfied with the product</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>very good, worth value and nice</li>
      <li>yes, it is a good sealant to cover treated zits better than a bandaid, but</li>
      <li>Excellent and fast shipping</li>
      <li>Excellent product, reliable seller, highly recommended and delivers the product at the date indicated</li>
      <li>Its so far the best thing I&#x27;ve found for his skin.</li>
      <li>Over all I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product.</li>
      <li>Anyway, none of those masks do magic and thats what cosmetologists are for.</li>
      <li>Thank you. &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT</li>
      <li>Probably not a bad thing, just hurts!</li>
      <li>And it stains &amp; spreads very quickly  </li>
      <li>it for my son who&#x27;s 17 and been having issues with acne.his face is looking much clean :)</li>
      <li>and she liked it so much</li>
      <li>Very good product, as soon as I started removing it already noted the change.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves the skin super clean and firm.</li>
      <li>and she wants to order some more</li>
      <li>It grabs lots of the tiny facials hairs which was kind of cool, but again- nothing for blackheads which is what&#x27;s in the name!</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>my face definitely felt super soft and fantastic after using this mask!!!</li>
      <li>But a seller should know better than send a Chinese product without detailed instructions.  </li>
      <li>It was slightly sensitive to the skin to peel off, so make sure your skin type can handle it.</li>
      <li>but it certainly helps!</li>
      <li>, his product is good, it just needs a little more information in English...</li>
      <li>I should say that it felt cleaner after removing the mask, though there was still some more deep spots.</li>
      <li>I certainly would buy it again</li>
      <li>but once and my mistake, after an acid peel, because it make my skin a lot pinker at a certain spot that took 3-4 days to resolve.  </li>
      <li>my face was actually very dry before using it, and after using this peel, my face felt so much better.</li>
      <li>Now my face is much healthier to use it again.</li>
      <li>I got this primarily because I like peel-off masks as an overnight spot-remedy for zits (after topical, it helps to smother the buggers w/a sealant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>BUT DOES TAKE OFF SOOOOO MUCH JUNK ON YOUR NOSE AREA....</li>
      <li>Amazon however has really upset me</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really use it</li>
      <li>Pretty sure it pulled off dead cells though.</li>
      <li>I tried it several times and in general it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>But my skin was super clear and soft.</li>
      <li>REALLY HURTS AROUND THAT AREA SINCE WE ARE VERY SENSITIVE THERE....</li>
      <li>Did make my face very soft.</li>
      <li>My face has never been so clear.</li>
      <li>time I put it on, I start feeling an itchy burning sensation that doesn&#x27;t last much time.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Beware if you have sensitive skin...</li>
      <li>I tried contacting Amazon directly and discuss why my last comments were pulled, but I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere to send comments.  </li>
      <li>My boyfriend has some of the worst blackheads as wells as very oily skin and after one use of this it made his face look more even and pulled many blackheads out.</li>
      <li>If you are struggling to get the excess off, use a toner or astringent, it comes right off without scrubbing your face raw.</li>
      <li>Very inky black.</li>

<li> If you are struggling to get the excess off, use a toner or astringent, it comes right off without scrubbing your face raw.</li>
<li> Very inky black.</li>
<li> Leaves my skin feeling soft but does not clean pores as deeply as expected.</li>
<li> Also, if you have ever used any peel off mask before , it is the same amount of pain as any other peel off mask.</li>
<li> /&gt;The mask does dry to a latex black-lacquer finish that stays in place.</li>
<li> you put it on your face, remove it when dry</li>
<li> after dry, not work at all.</li>
<li> In total it&#x27;s a average type cleanser mask.</li>
<li> The mask itself has a consistency similar to thick black nail polish, but it is very viscous - it slips and slides off your fingers &amp; face in the few seconds between the tube &amp; application.</li>
<li> whatever it gets on while in this wet state.</li>
<li> Works just about as well as I expected.</li>
<li> The product did not clear up or show any signs of reducing my pores was hard to peel off and the instructions indicated to put on a thin layer but product only peeled off when a large amount was applied.</li>
<li> However, unlike other peel offs, this comes off neatly, wthout any tug (so no exfolliation &amp; no pore-strip like effect).</li>
<li> sorry to say that, but this product does absolutely nothing.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t get ALL of the black heads</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t pull black heads out bit gets dead skin off</li>
<li> it does not clean out pores.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m still soaking a few items a week</li>
<li> Seems to have trouble with deeper ones.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have problematic skin at all, just the common areas like nose and chin but the way too less problematic than in the picture of the product.</li>
<li> (it&#x27;s not that bad, unless you have really sensitive skin I guess).</li>
<li> I was very disappointed as seller mailed me a product that had no English writing on the entire item.  </li>
<li> I start to feel a bit of pain when peeling it off, ineffective, not good for your skin after all.</li>
<li> I tried putting on a thin layer like the direction said but it was very hard to peel off.</li>
<li> But I followed the guidelines, and while I think they are absurd, they require me to comment on seller not product.  </li>
<li> I am an esthetician and try everything before i use on clients and this was useless!</li>
<li> it does what it says, but when peeling it off can be quite painful.</li>
<li> Need to try a sick layer.</li>

    <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft but does not clean pores as deeply as expected.</li>
    <li> sorry to say that, but this product does absolutely nothing. you put it on your face, remove it when dry and... nothing happens to your face. does not remove blackheads. i would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> very good, worth value and nice and i found worked for me and my friend also tried and she liked it so much and she wants to order some more, i am very satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> I tried it several times and in general it&#x27;s ok. I don&#x27;t have problematic skin at all, just the common areas like nose and chin but the way too less problematic than in the picture of the product. I should say that it felt cleaner after removing the mask, though there was still some more deep spots. Anyway, none of those masks do magic and thats what cosmetologists are for.

    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money. I am an esthetician and try everything before i use on clients and this was useless!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull black heads out bit gets dead skin off</li>
    <li> Good stuff, it works well, Not as awesomely as everyone touts, but I would buy it again. Thank you. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Tightens and cleans out my pores. Does hurt on your baby facial hairs. But what can we do. Beauty hurts.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed as seller mailed me a product that had no English writing on the entire item.  Turns out I just guessed how to use it and it works great.  But a seller should know better than send a Chinese product without detailed instructions.  Come on.  I suppose this will get pulled too.  But I followed the guidelines, and while I think they are absurd, they require me to comment on seller not product.  To me they are interchangeable.  I tried contacting Amazon directly and discuss why my last comments were pulled, but I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere to send comments.  I apologize to this Seller, his product is good, it just needs a little more information in English... Amazon however has really upset me</li>
    <li> Did make my face very soft. Did zero, zilch , zip, nada for blackheads though. Which is of course why I bought it.  It grabs lots of the tiny facials hairs which was kind of cool, but again- nothing for blackheads which is what&#x27;s in the name!</li>
    <li> my face definitely felt super soft and fantastic after using this mask!!! my face was actually very dry before using it, and after using this peel, my face felt so much better.</li>
    <li> I start to feel a bit of pain when peeling it off, ineffective, not good for your skin after all. I stopped using it after 5 times. ;s</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;Got it for my son who&#x27;s 17 and been having issues with acne.his face is looking much clean :)</li>
    <li> Good product. You can see the blackheads on the mask after removing. I certainly would buy it again</li>
    <li> Looks like its working....&lt;br /&gt;Beware if you have sensitive skin...&lt;br /&gt;Each time I put it on, I start feeling an itchy burning sensation that doesn&#x27;t last much time.&lt;br /&gt;When I peel it off, I notice that my face is Red on about 80% of it, but it goes away...</li>
    <li> I got this primarily because I like peel-off masks as an overnight spot-remedy for zits (after topical, it helps to smother the buggers w/a sealant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask does dry to a latex black-lacquer finish that stays in place. However, unlike other peel offs, this comes off neatly, wthout any tug (so no exfolliation &amp; no pore-strip like effect). The mask itself has a consistency similar to thick black nail polish, but it is very viscous - it slips and slides off your fingers &amp; face in the few seconds between the tube &amp; application. And it stains &amp; spreads very quickly  whatever it gets on while in this wet state. Very inky black. I&#x27;m still soaking a few items a week later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, it is a good sealant to cover treated zits better than a bandaid, but no- it does not clean out pores.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has some of the worst blackheads as wells as very oily skin and after one use of this it made his face look more even and pulled many blackheads out. I&#x27;m going to keep making him use it. Its so far the best thing I&#x27;ve found for his skin.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Used it once. It was good</li>
    <li> after dry, not work at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, reliable seller, highly recommended and delivers the product at the date indicated</li>
    <li> I tried putting on a thin layer like the direction said but it was very hard to peel off. Need to try a sick layer.</li>
    <li> The product did not clear up or show any signs of reducing my pores was hard to peel off and the instructions indicated to put on a thin layer but product only peeled off when a large amount was applied.</li>
    <li> Works just about as well as I expected. Didn&#x27;t get ALL of the black heads I&#x27;d hoped for but it certainly helps! Seems to have trouble with deeper ones. I tried it on my mum as well and it actually helped bring some of the ones it didn&#x27;t get to the surface so they were a lot easier to get. Over all I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product. I&#x27;d recommend steaming your face just to help get it all to the surface before using.</li>
    <li> is very good i only use i on my nose and it takes out all the dirt oil and stuff !!</li>
    <li> it does what it says, but when peeling it off can be quite painful. But my skin was super clear and soft. Pretty sure it pulled off dead cells though. Probably not a bad thing, just hurts!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT THIS REMOVER!  WORKS WONDERS.... JUST DON&#x27;T PUT TOO CLOSE AROUND THE EYE AREA CAUSE WHEN TAKING OFF IT REALLY HURTS AROUND THAT AREA SINCE WE ARE VERY SENSITIVE THERE.... BUT DOES TAKE OFF SOOOOO MUCH JUNK ON YOUR NOSE AREA....</li>
    <li> Excellent and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Whoa, this things really peels the dead skin cells off.  I didn&#x27;t really use it but once and my mistake, after an acid peel, because it make my skin a lot pinker at a certain spot that took 3-4 days to resolve.  Now my face is much healthier to use it again. If you like a thorough peel off mask, this is it! It was slightly sensitive to the skin to peel off, so make sure your skin type can handle it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! My face has never been so clear. Also, if you have ever used any peel off mask before , it is the same amount of pain as any other peel off mask. (it&#x27;s not that bad, unless you have really sensitive skin I guess). If you are struggling to get the excess off, use a toner or astringent, it comes right off without scrubbing your face raw. Will be purchasing again!</li>
