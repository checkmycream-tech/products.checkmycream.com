      <li>This stuff feels a lot better on my face than snazaroo.</li>
      <li>Its better then snazroo and ben nye.</li>
      <li>, feels really smooth, is super easy to apply, and looks great.</li>
      <li>Just make sure to seal it with baby powder/translucent powder and makeup sealant, otherwise it&#x27;ll smudge and come off really easy.</li>
      <li>I use it for Homestuck troll cosplays, and Light Grey is the perfect shade for it.</li>
      <li>Nice color (lighter than the grey circle in the product image) and very nice creamy texture.  </li>
      <li>also it spreads easily if you dont seal it</li>
      <li>The color is opaque and it is easy to make the color even without having to spend a lot of time blending.</li>
      <li>And it was still fairly easy to get off with makeup wipes.</li>

      <li>Mehron is always a great brand of makeup and this product is no different.</li>
      <li>Bought for Homestuck cosplay, is a great shade for trolls with no need to mix in white (a la Ben Nye method)</li>
      <li>(witch is super easy too).</li>
      <li>Would recommend to any cosplayer that paints full body and face.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t wore it to a con yet, but I will say it goes on SUPER fast and easy.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast and was here quickly!</li>
      <li>Have bought a few times and am always happy with the results.</li>
      <li>A bit lighter than I expected... but the quality is good.</li>
      <li>But if your doing this for homestuck cosplay, MAKE SURE YOU GET IT IN LIGHT GREY.</li>
      <li>I have used both snazaroo and ben nye in the past and I can honestly say that mehron is my favorite choice of paint.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I need to be Homestuck trash.</li>
      <li>However, I love the easiness of application and this is my second stick of the stuff.</li>
      <li>Exactly as stated.</li>
      <li>gave me perfect opacity and decent staying power, although it reflected a blue or green cast in certain lighting.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, there is enough dregs at the bottom where you can still paint your face if you hit it right as you begin to get ready.</li>
      <li>It goes on easier too, and you don&#x27;t need too much to cover your face.</li>
      <li>I sealed it with Mehron&#x27;s Barrier Setting Spray, and it lasted the whole day.</li>
      <li>It shipped really fast</li>
      <li>Mehron&#x27;s paint looks really even too.</li>
      <li>Pretty good for dat HS cosplay, but a little blue.</li>
      <li>I actually have not yet cracked into my latest stick because I&#x27;m still using up the dregs of the last stick.  </li>
      <li>The only problem is that you don&#x27;t realize how fast you&#x27;re going through the makeup, and then you get to the bottom of the stick.</li>
      <li>We used it as face makeup and to turn my son&#x27;s hair gray to look old.</li>
      <li>It is literally the exact shade of grey you need to cosplay a Homestuck troll.</li>
      <li>now this is all i use because the other brands just don&#x27;t have the right color i&#x27;m looking for.</li>
      <li>I was afraid at first to buy a light grey face paint that wasn&#x27;t snazaroo.</li>

    <li> This is 10x better than snazaroo or ben nye, probably the best makeup for anyone planning to cosplay a troll from Homestuck.</li>
    <li> Awesome for Homestuck cosplay. I sealed it with Mehron&#x27;s Barrier Setting Spray, and it lasted the whole day. And it was still fairly easy to get off with makeup wipes.</li>
    <li> I was afraid at first to buy a light grey face paint that wasn&#x27;t snazaroo. There are so many factors you need to put into when looking for the color of trolls skin. I asked my convention friends for a new brand because I was tired of the streaks and how long it took to put on. I didn&#x27;t want to use Ben Nye because you have to mix the black and white. Not my thing. So I decided on this. I haven&#x27;t wore it to a con yet, but I will say it goes on SUPER fast and easy. It&#x27;s the perfect color too. It also doesn&#x27;t have the blue tint Snaz does. Mehron&#x27;s paint looks really even too. It looks like grey skin. Not painted grey skin. This is a good choice if you are going to cosplay a Homestuck troll. Make sure to seal it with baby powder. It makes the grey less shiny.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and was here quickly! A bit lighter than I expected... but the quality is good. If set with a setting powder or spray, it stays for a long time.</li>

    <li> We used this for a dance routine. We used it as face makeup and to turn my son&#x27;s hair gray to look old. It worked out great!</li>
    <li> Exactly as stated. Worked just how we wanted.</li>
    <li> Best stuff for Homestuck cospplay.  Easy to use and great coverage.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for dat HS cosplay, but a little blue. (A liiitttle) also it spreads easily if you dont seal it</li>
    <li> I have used both snazaroo and ben nye in the past and I can honestly say that mehron is my favorite choice of paint. It takes my about 30 minutes to apply to my face, neck, and arms and it stays on all day. It is a little hard to scrub off but it really isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
    <li> Easy to use tube, blends nicely. Bought for Homestuck cosplay, is a great shade for trolls with no need to mix in white (a la Ben Nye method) Have bought a few times and am always happy with the results. Make sure to seal your paint!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I need to be Homestuck trash. The only problem is that you don&#x27;t realize how fast you&#x27;re going through the makeup, and then you get to the bottom of the stick. Luckily, there is enough dregs at the bottom where you can still paint your face if you hit it right as you begin to get ready. However, I love the easiness of application and this is my second stick of the stuff. I actually have not yet cracked into my latest stick because I&#x27;m still using up the dregs of the last stick.  Edit: Here&#x27;s a photo of me with paint on. It is literally the exact shade of grey you need to cosplay a Homestuck troll.</li>
    <li> Mehron is always a great brand of makeup and this product is no different. Goes on evenly and smooth</li>
    <li> Great application, and just the right color for troll skin!</li>
    <li> It goes on very easily and lasts forever if it is sealed with powder and spray. The color is opaque and it is easy to make the color even without having to spend a lot of time blending. I used it for Homestuck cosplay and a stone nymph costume.</li>
    <li> great stuff awesome color. used it for a cartoon cosplay i do for anime conventions. now this is all i use because the other brands just don&#x27;t have the right color i&#x27;m looking for. also it being in a stick form makes it quicker to put on. i just recommend using a makeup sponge to blend it in to make the coat even all over. also use a wedge sponge or qtip to get makeup into tight spaces like around your nostrils and the corners of your eyes near your nose and for detailing.</li>
    <li> very easy to apply and looked good for hours without touch up. It also didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts!</li>
    <li> Nice color (lighter than the grey circle in the product image) and very nice creamy texture.  However, it was hard to achieve opacity and it was impossible to seal with baby powder and setting spray. A blend of [[ASIN:B00429O3EY Mehron Clown White Makeup (2 oz)]] and [[ASIN:B00247XPYU Mehron Fantasy FX Makeup 1 oz Grey]] gave me perfect opacity and decent staying power, although it reflected a blue or green cast in certain lighting.  I&#x27;m not sure if the Mehron cream stick would have done the same, but I bet it would have.</li>
    <li> Impossible to seal. Wouldn&#x27;t reccommend</li>
    <li> Ok. Let me just say, this stuff is amazing for homestuck cosplayers. Its better then snazroo and ben nye. And if you seal it with baby powder, it stays on until you remove it (witch is super easy too). But if your doing this for homestuck cosplay, MAKE SURE YOU GET IT IN LIGHT GREY. THAT IS THE PERFECT TROLL SKIN COLOR.</li>
    <li> The product was received promptly, and in great condition as promised.&lt;br /&gt;The makeup has been used by my daughter for a Cosply meetup and she was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my homestuck-cosplay-loving sister.  She says it&#x27;s the best for this purpose- and loves using it for contouring as well.</li>
    <li> I REALLY love this stuff. I use it for Homestuck troll cosplays, and Light Grey is the perfect shade for it. It shipped really fast, feels really smooth, is super easy to apply, and looks great. Would recommend to any cosplayer that paints full body and face.</li>
