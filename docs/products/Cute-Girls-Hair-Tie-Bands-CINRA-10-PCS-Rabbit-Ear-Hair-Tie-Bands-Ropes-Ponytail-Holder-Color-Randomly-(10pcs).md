      <li>Being made and coming from overseas you usually except cheap material and an assumption</li>
      <li>So far, they haven&#x27;t lost their elasticity and my girls have long, kinky curly hair.</li>

<li> Especially for little girls.</li>
<li> they are definitely for a little girl</li>

    <li> I was a little skeptical about this product. Being made and coming from overseas you usually except cheap material and an assumption the product to be used for short term.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this! Very cute and my daughter gets compliments on these hair ties whenever she wears them out. Looks great in pictures. Well worth the wait</li>
    <li> So cute and comfortable!</li>

    <li> I brought these thinking they go around your head but they dont lol. Very pretty you cant got wrong with these . Especially for little girls. My only problem is the stitching.</li>
    <li> quality is below my expectations.  The elastic band is not elastic at all.  too loose.  4 of them had defective &amp;#34;ears&amp;#34; (the ears are torn or edges were not sewed well).</li>
    <li> Nice color, good material. A.little smaller</li>
    <li> High quality, I use these as a hair tie for my two year old daughter. They are strong enough and high quality enough to use by them selves to put all her hair up in a secure pony tail and they are super pretty and cute! You get a lot of them for a low price too.</li>
