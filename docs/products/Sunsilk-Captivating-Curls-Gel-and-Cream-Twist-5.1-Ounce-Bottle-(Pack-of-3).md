    <li> Much like those who have reviewed this before me, this has been my favorite product for the past 10 years for when I want to leave my hair curly! it doesn&#x27;t leave it crunchy or wet looking once my hair has dried and always kept my curls looking great all day long. words cannot express how incredibly frustrated I am that this product has been discontinued and I didn&#x27;t stock up a year ago when it was reasonably priced. most amazing product for curly hair!</li>
    <li> It has been so hard for me to find something that defines my curls but leaves them soft and doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or stiff. After it dries, it no longer looks like there&#x27;s any product on it. This is the first product that does this that I&#x27;ve found and liked in ages (Suave Natural Mousse was discontinued) and now it looks like this one might be discontinued, too. Why do they always DO that?? So we spend our money trying other products till we find one that we like, that&#x27;s why.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and when I could not find it any longer I turned to Amazon.</li>
    <li> This hair product is the best.  It defines and holds my curls without making them stiff and sticky.  I don&#x27;t know why the company discontinued making it.  Thank you Amazon for being able to supply it to us loyal users.</li>
    <li> i am bi-racial with curly thick hair! I have tried ENDLESS products but this is the BEST! it makes the curls last without being to greasy, or producing that &#x27;gel-crunch&#x27; curl. Just amazing and it smells good to!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great for my hair which is truly curly--not wavy and also not kinky/frizzy.  I have thick red curly hair, and this product keeps the curls \\&quot;curly\\&quot; with no stickiness or stiffness.  Perfect product.  I used to buy it at WalMart for less than $3.00.  Now I can&#x27;t find it--except here for over 300% the price!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It allows me to maintain beautiful NON-FRIZZY curls .. I have always had very curly hair, and with mousse or gel it becomes hard. This combination of gel and creme keeps my hair looking soft and natural.</li>
    <li> Always have loved this product.  Hate that they stopped manufacturing it</li>
    <li> sure, this stuff is inexpensive, but it doesn&#x27;t really work so great.  My curls come out soft, but pretty frizzy &amp; poorly defined.  The hold (if you can call it that) doesn&#x27;t last, either.  I much prefer[[ASIN:B000YJ31JE TIGI Catwalk Curls Rock Amplifier 4oz (2 PACK!)]]</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  I have natural, loose curls.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products to amp up the curl without leaving my hair stiff.  By far, this product does that better than anything else!  I finger comb a frizz product through my hair right after gently towel drying.  I do not brush my hair at all.  After my hair has dried slightly, I scrunch this product in.  I can scrunch a few more times as my hair air dries or use a diffuser to blow dry for more body.  Either way, my hair looks good all day.   The only problem I&#x27;d mention is that the product is no longer widely available.  The Sunsilk line seems to have been re-released without it.  I really hope they add it back into their product lineup.</li>
    <li> I love this product and hate that they&#x27;ve reformulated it.  The original brand has been discontinued and the new stuff doesn&#x27;t work as well, smell as good, or cost the same.

    <li> This is a wonderful product and I haope they are not going to discontinue making it, as I just discovered it as a result of a client.  I was pleased with the seller and would give an A++++++++++++++++.</li>
    <li> Sunsilk Captivating Curls Gel &amp; Cream Twist makes hair shiny and smooth (not dull or greasy). I have split ends, dry over-processed hair and it is thinning. Absolutely the best product I have ever tried. All senior citizens should try this. Gives you a boost of confidence.</li>
    <li> I love this produce for my shoulder length naturally curly hair.  I am glad I can still find it on line!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like the product. It seems to work well. It just doesn&#x27;t have a lot in the container.</li>
    <li> I wish that they didn&#x27;t stop making this product, can&#x27;t find anything similuar that is affordable. Sadly evenutlly I will have to find another product.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a very good product, but hard to find.Makes your hair feel full.My daughter likes it.There are different prices out there.</li>
    <li> This stuff gives beautiful curls that shine and last a few days without needing to start all over. I have long hair (bra length) and it gives long ringlets sort of willy nilly but I add a colorful scarf and tie it in the front or you can put a Barrett on the side.  I don&#x27;t comb the curls out.  I use those long snake like rollers that snap. You do need to brush the curls out after a couple of days because it will tangle. I try to do it at night so it will dry. This stuff is expensive but it&#x27;s hard to find good setting lotion.</li>
    <li> So thankful Amazon has this product for sale again, since it is now discontinued.  My sisters and I all love this product and we split the last shipment I ordered.  Three happy ladies here!!</li>
    <li> Will continue to buy this product.  Dries without gumming up your hair and helps define curls.  Wish it was still sold in stores.  Hopefully, I will be able to buy it in the future.</li>
