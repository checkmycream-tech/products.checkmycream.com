      <li>I really love this product and</li>
      <li>glad I purchased it.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Though I can&#x27;t say that it is a dupe for sure</li>
      <li>I tried it more them once with diffent eyeshadow</li>
      <li>, I have cheap eye shadow and this primer keeps my eye shadow on all day!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have used eye primer, and this product is amazing!.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>and I love the price</li>
      <li>My eye shadow stays so much better with this, no fading or wearing off.</li>
      <li>Works fine.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>cheap, efficient</li>
      <li>It does have a light color to it, but once I put my shadow on you can&#x27;t tell.</li>
      <li>Ni8ce but a bit on the light side for  me.</li>
      <li>Covers imperfections on the eyes, like veins, redness, and discoloration with it&#x27;s light peachy/pink tone.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this eye primer, it does exactly as it says and once I put my shadow</li>
      <li>Really good especially for the price</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this before when i very very first started using makeup.</li>
      <li>Its cheap and works real well lasts all day</li>
      <li>the quality is worth the quanity..</li>
      <li>This product was shipped pretty quickly though so</li>
      <li>For the most part, my go-to eye makeup is pretty simple and neutral, so this primer will make my life so much easier by evening everything out from the get-go instead of me having to apply more eyeshadows to cover everything up.</li>
      <li>Not much to say, pretty good product.</li>
      <li>and this does a significantly better job for just a few dollars more.</li>
      <li>(like I do every morning) then the primer &amp; the pot shoot off in different directions.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that which is an easy fix with super glue, I&#x27;d say give it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>You just twist the top off and twist it back on.</li>
      <li>Will probably purchase more in future.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Yes think pink but not an issue if you&#x27;re putting shadow on top of this product.</li>
      <li>, REALLY pop.</li>
      <li>Came fast as well</li>
      <li>Makes eyeshadow colors really</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it does much for holding shadow in place and it does crease.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly, lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>That combination in itself is enough to brighten my eyes when I want a quick eye fix.</li>
      <li>I often wear it alone to even out skin tone on my (older) eyelids.  </li>
      <li>You only need a tiny bit of product, as with most primers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of primer, including high end options...but Jordana&lt;br /&gt;beats</li>
      <li>but now that i KNOW that is the point of an eyeshadow base, i can FASHO say that its a great drug store product to add to your collection/kit or WHATEVER and not to mention its cheap and for what you pay..</li>
      <li>This product is really ok, eyeshadow does last a little longer and show a little better with the primer</li>
      <li>This is a very neutral color (obviously, as a primer).  </li>
      <li>considering what I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
      <li>Buy it u will have no regrets.</li>
      <li>Super thick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe beauty gurus on YouTube haven&#x27;t raved about this! I found out about this eye primer when I searched for a dupe for Mac&#x27;s Painterly Paint Pot. Though I can&#x27;t say that it is a dupe for sure since I&#x27;ve never tried it, it does everything I was looking for at a fraction of the $22 for the Mac base:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Covers imperfections on the eyes, like veins, redness, and discoloration with it&#x27;s light peachy/pink tone. This has been my number one complaint with all other primers because they apply so sheer! For the most part, my go-to eye makeup is pretty simple and neutral, so this primer will make my life so much easier by evening everything out from the get-go instead of me having to apply more eyeshadows to cover everything up. Finally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Makes eyeshadow colors really, REALLY pop. I was using E.L.F.&#x27;s $1 primer and this does a significantly better job for just a few dollars more. I did a side by side test and was blown away by the dramatic difference! It&#x27;s like night and day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I actually like the packaging. It&#x27;s simple and chic. You just twist the top off and twist it back on. Mine came glued to its little base just fine, no issues there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You only need a tiny bit of product, as with most primers. I&#x27;m guessing this little pot will last me a long time, though I&#x27;m already planning on buying another as a back-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to test its longevity for a full day yet, but I feel like it&#x27;ll do really great considering what I&#x27;ve seen so far. I&#x27;m so impressed! Will update this review to confirm when I&#x27;ve thoroughly tested it.</li>
    <li> Works fine. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> One use of this and you&#x27;ll look better than Mrs America !!~!  Ark ark . . .</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used eye primer, and this product is amazing!. I find it blends well enough with my skin that sometime I just use it and some translucent powder, and that&#x27;s all. That combination in itself is enough to brighten my eyes when I want a quick eye fix.</li>
    <li> Really good especially for the price</li>
    <li> Not a very good summer product, any amount of perspiration/ sweat will make this product run.</li>
    <li> Yes think pink but not an issue if you&#x27;re putting shadow on top of this product. I don&#x27;t think it does much for holding shadow in place and it does crease.</li>
    <li> It goes on smooth. Makes a nice base coat for eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> Sucks....my eyeshadow blended all to gather and looked a mess....I tried it more them once with diffent eyeshadow and it all did the same it made everything oily and a big mess</li>
    <li> Great drugstore product for the price.</li>
    <li> My eyelids get oily so none of my eye make up ever stay put for long. I bought this primer with big hopes. Sorry to say it was a let down. Unfortunately my make up still runs and creases. This product was shipped pretty quickly though so kudos there. However, I don&#x27;t believe I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before when i very very first started using makeup. I didnt like it because it was TOO hard to remove it but now that i KNOW that is the point of an eyeshadow base, i can FASHO say that its a great drug store product to add to your collection/kit or WHATEVER and not to mention its cheap and for what you pay.. the quality is worth the quanity..</li>
    <li> Works really good on my eyes</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eye primer, it does exactly as it says and once I put my shadow on- it&#x27;s on for the day. It does have a light color to it, but once I put my shadow on you can&#x27;t tell. It&#x27;s a must for your eyes if you want all the hard work of your shadow to last.</li>
    <li> The Jordana Eye Primer / Base 01 Primer .....It&#x27;s a good product, great primer.  Jordana Eye Primer / Base 01 Primer</li>
    <li> This product keeps my eyeshadow in place all day without retouching.  No creasing at all and I have oily skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve never used a primer before and I&#x27;m so happy I found this.  My eye shadow stays so much better with this, no fading or wearing off.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Very easy to apply. Not cakey or gooey at all. Will probably purchase more in future.</li>
    <li> This works great and I love the price</li>
    <li> Was really hard to apply. Super thick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a primer and never knew what brand or what kind to get it and saw this one browsing through amazon and decided to get it from the good reviews and I LOVE IT. It&#x27;s great, I have cheap eye shadow and this primer keeps my eye shadow on all day! for the price as well perfect! I totally recommend and I will definitely re-purchase after mines out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of primer, including high end options...but Jordana&lt;br /&gt;beats them all with this unassuming little pot.  I will never go back to spending $18 for a base&lt;br /&gt;that doesn&#x27;t work as well as this.  Great coverage and helps shadow&lt;br /&gt;colors pop and stay put for hours.</li>
    <li> This was too oily and my shadow creased.</li>
    <li> Works amazing at keeping my eye shadow from fading or creasing all day and into the night. So in love with it, will order again!!</li>
    <li> This product is really ok, eyeshadow does last a little longer and show a little better with the primer but it&#x27;s not a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Great primer I love it. Its cheap and works real well lasts all day glad I purchased it. Buy it u will have no regrets. Came fast as well</li>
    <li> I really love this product and my eye shadow stays on all day long! You need to try it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clinique&#x27;s product for years and decided to try this. I think it&#x27;s a much better product and you use much less and for about 1/3 the cost. It doesn&#x27;t glide on as nicely, but it lasts longer. My shadow stays on all day now. Dab on eyes with your fingertips rather than glide. It&#x27;s also a great under eye concealer primer for make-up.</li>
    <li> This is a staple for me to use under eyeshadow. Makes colors look better and application of shadow lasts longer. Have no issues with product clumping in creases.</li>
    <li> Ni8ce but a bit on the light side for  me.</li>
    <li> Nice for the price, and it just hold up all day.  You will have to put two coats on for the best turn out.</li>
    <li> Not much to say, pretty good product.</li>
    <li> I like the product but still doesn&#x27;t last as long as I like. But a good product for the price</li>
    <li> Got this in a timely manner after ordering. The product itself is amazing. It keeps your eyeshadow from budging. I only gave it 4 stars because the pot that the tin (product) sits in is was glued down at all. So if you wanna use it, you have to hold it in the pot &amp; if you knock it off the table (like I do every morning) then the primer &amp; the pot shoot off in different directions.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that which is an easy fix with super glue, I&#x27;d say give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> love it. great eye primer. cheap, efficient</li>
    <li> Awesome eye primer! I have problems with creasing on my lids all the time, and this help to keep my eye shadow flawless :)</li>
    <li> This is a very neutral color (obviously, as a primer).  Goes on smoothly, lasts a long time.  I often wear it alone to even out skin tone on my (older) eyelids.  Very pleased.</li>
