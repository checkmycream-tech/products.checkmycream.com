      <li>This cologne has a light scent and is great for daytime.</li>
      <li>Always popular with the ladies</li>
      <li>I liked them too, but this one was my favorite.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing and unique fragrance!  </li>
      <li>excellent cologne which is enjoyable for both myself and whomever I happen to be near at that</li>
      <li>Out of all the colognes I wear this one gets the most compliments.</li>
      <li>did a lot of research on many colognes and purchased 2 others, which from the ratings of women whom have smelled all 3, rate this as 1st.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>I definitely love it and would buy it again.</li>
      <li>My favorite scent for men.</li>
      <li>More a fall perfume</li>
      <li>and I was so glad I did.</li>
      <li>This scent was my favorite of everything they had at JC Penney.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly and is a very clean and sexy scent.</li>
      <li>Purchased as a gift for my boyfriend... hands down the BEST smelling cologne ever.</li>
      <li>We are both very picky and love this one!</li>
      <li>bought this on amazon in March 2013 and paid $52.50; no tax, free shipping.  </li>
      <li>Roget and Gallet Extra Vieille - wonderful scent - very masculine with woody undertones.</li>
      <li>I have the original L&#x27;Homme</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even tell you how many women have bought this for their man after smelling mine haha...</li>
      <li>Fake&lt;br /&gt;Box full of longitudinal cuts..</li>
      <li>but I love it, such a sexy smell</li>
      <li>I give it a 4 star because it has a unique scent, and it&#x27;s a calm appealing rich young guy scent.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment as well!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had YSL colognes before, but this one is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>The parfum costs more but may purchase that next time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not really upset with this cologne, as it really does have a unique and appealing scent to it...</li>
      <li>Nice smell not strong, just about right .</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s gentle on the nose.</li>
      <li>It lasts the whole day as well.</li>
      <li>From the comments that I have received since I got this cologne, this is an absolute winner.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is mild and masculine - it is also long lasting (12 hours or more), giving off many variations or shades of scent at different times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ordered this item by mistake and it was better than the brand that had previously ordered.</li>
      <li>I highly suggest looking at this fragrance if you are in the market.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I started wearing this 2 years ago, I&#x27;m guessing about the time when it was first out, and got multiple comments daily for the first month of use.</li>
      <li>it delivery was quick but not what I expected</li>
      <li>and I gave it to him after only a couple sprays it was still brand new!!</li>
      <li>Pour L&#x27; Homme - Versace - clean and somewhat flowery - subtle - long lasting with very nice releases of other notes throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
      <li>Bought this as a gift for my 24 yr old son.</li>
      <li>I think it is similar to Burberry Brit, another scent that I really like.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s lost some of its wow factor, but the scent is unmistakably Yves.</li>
      <li>First off, I&#x27;m 32 years old, white, and male.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t get me wrong, the cologne smells almost exactly the same as the real one, but it is slightly less strong and last about 3 to 4 hours instead of around 8+ hours with the real one, if you want to save 40 bucks and want something very similar to the original</li>
      <li>Amazon was really nice about getting the problem fixed, ended up issuing the refund, ill probably end up donating it or something....</li>
      <li>Nuit del Homme - YSL - long lasting, complex, and fragrant - which has brought many amorous/favorable comments from members of the opposite</li>
      <li>/&gt;Alright guys, for those of you who think this cologne is real, i have some bad news for you, it isn&#x27;t 100% authentic...</li>

<li> /&gt;Alright guys, for those of you who think this cologne is real, i have some bad news for you, it isn&#x27;t 100% authentic...</li>
<li> you will notice that the real box is all black inside, the fake one has a white stripe on the left and right side of the box..</li>
<li> /&gt;Anyway if you guys want to know how to spot if its fake, there are 3 things i noticed that give the cologne away, the first is that on the UPC there is a little Scanner code, on the real box the thing can actually be scanned and looks real, on the fake</li>
<li> last less thn 30 min</li>
<li> I loved in the store but hate it on me, smells cheap; im disappointed</li>
<li> /&gt;Badly let me down...</li>
<li> the second give away is that the way the second cardboard opens is in the wrong direction...</li>
<li> to me, it&#x27;s just a little tip beyond an average cologne.</li>
<li> it just looks like a little box with a bunch of squares in it...</li>
<li> Not overwhelming.</li>
<li> It smells weak and diluted.</li>
<li> I also checked out the Spice scents in the Gucci Guilty lineup.</li>
<li> I suppose I have recieved a fake perfume.</li>
<li> so bad to hv  a fake product..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really upset with this cologne, as it really does have a unique and appealing scent to it... it&#x27;s relaxing to the mind and it&#x27;s gentle on the nose. I think ladies will appreciate this on a man. However, I do not think this cologne meets the hype...  to me, it&#x27;s just a little tip beyond an average cologne. I give it a 4 star because it has a unique scent, and it&#x27;s a calm appealing rich young guy scent.</li>
    <li> I suppose I have recieved a fake perfume.</li>
    <li> Fake&lt;br /&gt;Box full of longitudinal cuts..&lt;br /&gt;I trusted amazon name..&lt;br /&gt;Badly let me down...&lt;br /&gt;Feel so bad to hv  a fake product..&lt;br /&gt;Though smell good&lt;br /&gt;But last less thn 30 min&lt;br /&gt;No use&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money&lt;br /&gt;Dont buy</li>
    <li> This is one of the best colognes ever made. Period.  I started wearing this 2 years ago, I&#x27;m guessing about the time when it was first out, and got multiple comments daily for the first month of use. I guess everybody is wearing it now so it&#x27;s lost some of its wow factor, but the scent is unmistakably Yves.</li>
    <li> great smell, great product</li>
    <li> Very pleasant smell. More a fall perfume but I also like it during the summer. Happy!</li>
    <li> My favorite scent for men. Head turner 100%</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for myself and my son smelled it on me and asked what was I wearing and I gave it to him after only a couple sprays it was still brand new!! Awesome Fragrance a must have!!!</li>
    <li> Best smelling guy around now ;)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even tell you how many women have bought this for their man after smelling mine haha...it smells awesome!</li>
    <li> Purchased for husband after smelling it on a customer. His wife told me where they purchased it.  I decided to try Amazon and I was so glad I did. The parfum costs more but may purchase that next time.</li>
    <li> They should change the name to &amp;#34;Liquid Panty Dropper&amp;#34; because that&#x27;s what it is.  It smells great and the ladies love it!  Get this cologne.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on amazon in March 2013 and paid $52.50; no tax, free shipping.  As I write this, it&#x27;s gone up $13.25 making it $65.75.  It&#x27;s that popular!</li>
    <li> Got a lot of compliments when I was wearing it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. The scent lasts. pleasing smell</li>
    <li> The most amazing fragrance ever!! Every woman will agree...promise!</li>
    <li> This cologne has a light scent and is great for daytime. It maintains its strength throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This is not something I would wear it is too feminine for me it delivery was quick but not what I expected</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my boyfriend... hands down the BEST smelling cologne ever.</li>
    <li> I loved in the store but hate it on me, smells cheap; im disappointed but maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work on me. It smells weak and diluted.</li>
    <li> Incredible scent, doesn&#x27;t HAVE to be worn at night.  I have the original L&#x27;Homme as well and this one is almost as versatile actually.  Projection isn&#x27;t huge, but the scent is incredible.</li>
    <li> My husband enjoys this fragrance and so do I.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my 24 yr old son. Loves it. Not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Good product... smells good</li>
    <li> Love it. Will recommend for men. Nice smell not strong, just about right . will buy again or will recommend for gift</li>
    <li> KNOW THE PRODUCT GOOD PRICE</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite cologne. Out of all the colognes I wear this one gets the most compliments.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing and unique fragrance!  I highly suggest looking at this fragrance if you are in the market.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this. I purchased this as a valentines day gift. My sweety loves it. Very pleased with the product!</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m 32 years old, white, and male. This scent was my favorite of everything they had at JC Penney. It was listed under the \\&quot;Spice\\&quot; category. It&#x27;s spicy and that&#x27;s what I like. I also checked out the Spice scents in the Gucci Guilty lineup. I liked them too, but this one was my favorite. I think it is similar to Burberry Brit, another scent that I really like.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of colones in my life. Is one has gotten the best response from the girls :) They all love it.</li>
    <li> Always popular with the ladies</li>
    <li> Misleading information, though not all bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright guys, for those of you who think this cologne is real, i have some bad news for you, it isn&#x27;t 100% authentic... don&#x27;t get me wrong, the cologne smells almost exactly the same as the real one, but it is slightly less strong and last about 3 to 4 hours instead of around 8+ hours with the real one, if you want to save 40 bucks and want something very similar to the original then this is the one!

    <li> very nice scent. Hubby loved it</li>
    <li> I ordered this cologne for my fiance as a Christmas gift. It arrived very quickly and is a very clean and sexy scent. We are both very picky and love this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had YSL colognes before, but this one is by far my favorite. It is a very nice fragrance - yet not too overpoweringly strong. It lasts the whole day as well. I definitely love it and would buy it again. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Its good but needs something else</li>
    <li> what&#x27;s to say? it smells freaking awesome ! Mmmmmm !!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend. He likes it but I love it, such a sexy smell</li>
    <li> I ordered this item by mistake and it was better than the brand that had previously ordered. Go figure. My wife loves the scent!! Fast shipment as well!!</li>
    <li> From the comments that I have received since I got this cologne, this is an absolute winner.  The fragrance is mild and masculine - it is also long lasting (12 hours or more), giving off many variations or shades of scent at different times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent cologne which is enjoyable for both myself and whomever I happen to be near at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research on many colognes and purchased 2 others, which from the ratings of women whom have smelled all 3, rate this as 1st.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For your interest, in order of ranking - they are (see my ratings of those products):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Nuit del Homme - YSL - long lasting, complex, and fragrant - which has brought many amorous/favorable comments from members of the opposite sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Pour L&#x27; Homme - Versace - clean and somewhat flowery - subtle - long lasting with very nice releases of other notes throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Roget and Gallet Extra Vieille - wonderful scent - very masculine with woody undertones.</li>
