    <li> Whoa.. This electronic pedicure machine is top notch! It shipped out to me very quickly, and arrived nicely packaged in its box. I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality for this price! I have to admit that I was expecting something a little less amazing, so I am beyond thrilled that it&#x27;s so lovely! The two attachments are crazy simple to attach and detach. It barely takes any effort at all to do. The machine works nicely, and isn&#x27;t super slow or glitchy like others I&#x27;ve tried in the past. This is honestly the best one I have used. I love that it comes with a little brush to help clean it off after use. That&#x27;s actually very handy, and also very considerate of them to include. My feet definitely feel significantly smoother after just one use. I am very very impressed with how nicely it performs, and would definitely repurchase. (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> This is the second hair brush straightener that I have tested out.  I have thick coarse curly hair.  This brush took about four or five minutes to get to the top temperature.  When using it the buttons for the temperature are in the way.  Since they are the handle I have to check the temperature often to make sure it&#x27;s on the temperature that I want.  This unit gets really hot on the back side and about half way up the sides.  This brush seemed to still cut down some time that it normally takes to straighten my hair compared to using a flat iron.  But I did have to still finish my hair with a flat iron to get it really straight and because at the ends the brush didn&#x27;t straighten well for me and gave a curl.  But I still rather use the two together because of the one reason of saving time.  Disclosure:  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> WOW...night and day difference after using this foot file.  I hate to feel my feet rubbing together when I am trying to sleep,  if they aren&#x27;t soft....and they aren&#x27;t soft.  LOL.  I have tried all kinds of ways of softening them.  I soak them regularly and use a pumice stone, but nothing really changed them very much.  This electronic foot file did.  You can actually see the dead skin coming off like dust.  I like seeing it because then I know for sure that it&#x27;s working.  You do need to test the pressure because you can file down the skin much and it will really burn.  It holds very nicely in your hand so you have good control.  Just place it lightly to the skin and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  It comes with 2 heads, so another person could also use it.  You shouldn&#x27;t share heads because you could spread germs and fungus...like athletes foot.  The head is easy to change with the press of a button and it comes with a small brush to clean the debris from the area.  It&#x27;s actually much more powerful that I thought it would be,  so like I said,  touch it lightly to your skin.  This is a wonderful product ...especially if you seem to get a lot of dead skin and callouses on your feet. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This worked wonders for my husbands feet!</li>
    <li> Before I tried this product my solution to dry skin on the foot was probably the worst one ever - I would try to cut off the hard bits with scissors. And you can imagine, what it produced… Needless to say, the skin only hardened even more and the my feet looked pretty terrible. It got to the point my friends were asking me if I had some kind of skin infection when we once relaxing at the pool. Very embarrassing!&lt;br /&gt;In fact, if was a recommendation from one of my friends that lead me to buying this product. She also suffered from dry, cracked skin on her feet and said that this helped her a lot.&lt;br /&gt; As I have mentioned following the inappropriate removing the skin on my feet was badly damaged but after a couple of uses I noticed the change.I applied it every second day as I was a bit worried that daily use would be a bit too much. After about two weeks It noticed that the skin started to look smoother and was a lot softer when I touched it. The use of this foot filer combine with the foot cream I bought  in a pharmacy my long-term problems past three week mark.&lt;br /&gt;The product is really easy to operate, it just needs two AA batteries to put in.&lt;br /&gt;The item was delivered it on time, so pleased with the quality of service as well. Give this a try and you won’t regret!</li>
    <li> This new Pedi gadget is excellent. No need to spend money on pedicures!</li>
    <li> It did not work at all, very cheap !!! even I changed batteries and put new ones , still it didn&#x27;t work, it is made in China, I have had many china made items, all were cheapest quality and poor materials !!!</li>
    <li> I paid 40.00 for another one that was nothing compared to this.</li>
    <li> This callus remover HAS ABSOLUTELY NO POWER.  Extremely disappointed.  If I hadn&#x27;t already used it, I&#x27;d send it back!!!  Supreme JUNK</li>
    <li> Love this! It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> Being a runner for the last nine years and always working a job on my feet has left my feet with large calluses on the bottom of my big toes. My feet  looked scary  in summer sandals. I&#x27;ve tried other products  with little results. I read the reviews and decided to give the Mousand pedi shaver a try and I am overjoyed with the results. Now I must go put on my wedge sandals and head out into the world with great confidence.</li>
    <li> Not as good as expected turn off when turned upside down</li>
    <li> This works just as good as that pedi egg that they charged twice as much for</li>
    <li> Felt in love! No more trip to the nail shop!</li>
    <li> I received this electronic pedicure foot file today and could not wait to take it out of the box.  I was quit surprised.  I took it out and it worked right away.  So I slipped off my flip flop and went at my callus and rough dry feet after a harsh winter.  It did the trick.  I like how sock it is to my feet because my callus and dry feet are not in terrible condition.  I don&#x27;t think someone like my dad could use it though because he gets HUGE calluses and he would probably break it in one use.  But for me it should last a long time.  I am terribly ticklish anyway and don&#x27;t like things on my feel that bother them.  I hate foot file, but this file is nice soft and I don&#x27;t hear the sound of it scraping the dry skin off of my feet but I do see it taking it off .  Now I only need to put a foot cream on it and I am good to go.  It took me less than 5 minutes to get all the dead skin and callus&#x27;s off of my feet.  So I am a happy camper!!  *received for testing and review</li>
    <li> My heels are kinda awful. I often used a pumice stone, followed by lotions, &amp; always wore socks to bed. I received this electronic pedicure foot file last week &amp; have been using it once a day on my feet, mainly the heel area. My heels are extremely cracked &amp; have calluses.I am glad that I was able to receive this as a sample in exchange for my honest opinion. It really helps me to make my own little spa at home. Summer time activities make my feet really dry, &amp; I don&#x27;t always have the time/money to go to the spa, but with this tool, I can keep my feet looking great, &amp; smooth this summer. It is gentle, yet very effective at exfoliating all my dead skin. I just add my favorite lotion, or an essential oil with a little massage, makes for the perfect finish.</li>
    <li> Thought it was stronger</li>
    <li> My feet are so smooth after using this product i recommend to everyone</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! I have terrible cracks from never wearing shoes outside in the summer! I&#x27;ve only used it once as I just got it today but so far my feet are a 1,000 times better!!! Had to show you the photos to see the difference!</li>
    <li> It is a good product and useful..</li>
    <li> This is actually better than I thought!  I had read so many bad reviews on various pedi foot files that I was skeptical that anything I ordered would work as well as the little tool my pedicurist uses at the day spa. But I like this one. You do have to figure out just how much pressure to use as too much stops it. But once I got the hang of it, I was very pleased. It does a great job on my heels and rough spots in between pedicures.</li>
    <li> I tried brand new duracell and energizer batteries an Its not strong enough it take awhile to get the job done and my feet are not that bad..</li>
    <li> This electric file removes callouses well.  However, the callouses grew back in a couple of days.  When I used the Ped Egg, it took at least a week for the callouses to return.  I am no longer using the electric file.  I will just use my Ped Egg.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, wish it had a little more power though.</li>
    <li> If you apply any pressure at all this will stop spinning. It takes about a half hour with this thing to do what I could by hand in 5 minutes. No worth the money.</li>
    <li> Loved it... when I first got it. I&#x27;ve used it about once a week to keep rough edges away. It&#x27;s come time to change batteries and it will not work at all now. I would have kept my regular foot file and elbow grease had I known this callous removers life would be so short...</li>
    <li> Love this and use it almost daily.  My feet love it too.</li>
    <li> cheaply built barely works/spins.  better results using a pumice stone</li>
    <li> Items was received with batteries inclosed and did not operate.  Replaced the batteries and still did not work.  Item being returned for refund.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product but it really does work great and is very easy to use.  It does take a little while on really heavy calluses but be patient and you will love the results.</li>
    <li> Not much power at all. Its ok for $20 but not much more</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all, requested to send it back and was required to send it back in 24 hours.  Unreasonable amount of time to ask when it doesn&#x27;t even come in that amount if time with prime.</li>
    <li> I first tested my son&#x27;s and was amazingly surprised how good it is.  I just ordered one for myself as well as my other 3 adult children.  I love this and highly recommend it. My feet now look like they have been professionally looked after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU!!</li>
    <li> I love this Mousand Pedi Electronic Pedicure Foot File! My feet have been so hard on the bottom and sides of my feet. I used this foot file and it made my feet feel extremely soft and got all of the dead skin from my feet. You have to use 2 AA batteries, which were included and already in the electric foot file. It came with a extra file and a brush to keep it clean. When using it, you might need a towel because dead skin will come off. This Mousand foot file came in a orange box case for convenient storage when your not using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this item all summer long. Now I don&#x27;t have to go to the nail salon to get a pedicure. I can do my own at home and save money! I recommend this product to anyone wanting soft and smooth feet.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>

    <li> I love it it make your feet smooth and easy to use. I will recomend this product and the price is really good shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> The motor is too weak for this instrument to do what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> Mine came broken and in an unsealed box.</li>
    <li> For a while now, I have been experiencing pains under my feet when I do some early morning workout and during running. Though I use pain cure medicines but the pain has refused to subside until my colleague at the office introduced the Mousand model.&lt;br /&gt;From my first use of this simple electronic hardware, I can confidently say that my pain is now in the past. This product comes with a user manual and its explanation on its use is concise and straight forward also easy to carry around. The feeling associated during use is quite warm and exciting as it relaxes the skin. Now, I move around free of pains and I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am a marathon runner so my feet look far from good.  My wife got this for me and it is amazing. Well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it and will will tell the guys in my running club.</li>
    <li> I live in the country, so going barefoot outside in the rocks is a pretty normal occurrence. I know this is not good for my feet, but it happens. My feet are usually pretty dry and cracked, I put lotion on them daily but it really doesn’t do any good. I am happy that I came across this pedicure foot file. This thing really helped get the dry skin off of my heels and the balls of my feet. It is really easy to use and comes with a brush to brush away the excess skin as it gets taken off.  The brush also works to clean the foot file itself. My feet really like the massage that this device gives and it does not hurt at all. I am impressed! I was given the chance to test and give my honest opinion on this foot file/callus remover during a promotion.</li>
    <li> After years of working out and running my feet developed&lt;br /&gt;some serious dead skin issues.  I&#x27;ve tried using pumice stones, but that&#x27;s annoying because&lt;br /&gt;I have to sit down, and pedicures can get expensive. The Mousand callus remover appeals to&lt;br /&gt;me because it&#x27;s not expensive and easy to use and because I have experience using it. I used&lt;br /&gt;my fianc&amp;eacute;es so much she is making me buy my own. I&#x27;ve never had foot pain issues, so I&#x27;m not&lt;br /&gt;sure how it helps with that but what I can say is it is nice to have smooth feet again. The&lt;br /&gt;motor is pretty powerful, so cheap AA batteries are not going to last long. Unless you keep&lt;br /&gt;lots of the dollar store kind in your home. It is  pretty easy to clean, and I can use it&lt;br /&gt;in the shower although I prefer dry. I found that after using the callus remover to put&lt;br /&gt;vaseline or lotion on my feet and wear socks helps keep the calluses down. The Mousand is&lt;br /&gt;a must have for people with rough feet.</li>
    <li> Show off those lovely feet and walk with confidence! You don&#x27;t need to go to the spa and pay expensive service to achieve callus-free feet. The Mousand Electronic Callus Remover provides fast and effective solution that removes rough calluses on your feet right in the comfort of your own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been invited to a friend’s wedding 4 days ago. That was right upon my return from a month-long holiday. I knew my feet needed some pampering, and a makeover I must say. This Mousand callus remover makes the job done in a fast and convenient way.  It sports a powerful roller head that spins at 360 degrees, removing all the unwanted rough and jagged skin instantly without hurting my feet.  The ergonomic handle is a plus; I love how it keeps me comfortable during the entire process. It’s very easy to use with modern design and classy colors, just perfect for a fashionista like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No tricky installation. You just place the battery, turn it on, and you&#x27;re on your way to fresh-looking feet in just seconds.

    <li> This item worked less than thirty minutes before it quit working. My wife thought the batteries had run down, I changed the batteries but that didn&#x27;t solve the problem. I believe the on/off switch has failed. I have contacted the seller for a replacement because my wife really liked the Pedi when it was working. I would have asked for a refund.</li>
