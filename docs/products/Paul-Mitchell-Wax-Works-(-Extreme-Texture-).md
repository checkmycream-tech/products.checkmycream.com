      <li>I live in a somewhat humid climate and my hair tends to curl on the lower parts underneath my ears and by my neck.  </li>
      <li>My husband has wild curly hair that needs taming and it helps</li>
      <li>Try it and you&#x27;ll never go back to the old stuff.  </li>
      <li>and I use Slick Works, Re-Works, and &#x27;Freeze and Shine Super Spray.&#x27;</li>

<li> The Paul Mitchell Wax Works is gentle enough to work with in my hair and holds my style without being stiff.  </li>
<li> For me the only draw back is it needs to be applied on dry hair.  </li>
<li> If you flat iron your hair or tie it back wet, when I flat iron my hair</li>
<li> but it have a different name then extreme</li>
<li> Other hair wax left my hair with an odd feel</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not very flexible, but it tames hair and makes it manageable and shiny.</li>
<li> This product is the only product that will tame those frizzies and give me the style I want.  </li>
<li> I was a little disappointed in that, but I purchased the product anyway and really liked it.</li>
<li> It is extremely convenient to have it on auto-ship.</li>
<li> Then I looked at the ingredients and its packed with Parabens and all the other can Cancer causing ingredients.</li>
<li> but you must get the extreme</li>
<li> Amazon previously sold two for this price, now you just get one.  </li>
<li> you add a few drops of water then pin down</li>
<li> but it should be thick like tooth paste when you put it on your palms if its to dry</li>
<li> It is not too heavy.</li>
<li> This stuff is not for me .. sticky .. just a waste of money as it went in the trash</li>
<li> No matter how I styled it, it always looked messy.  </li>
<li> Keeps my hair manageable without being stiff.</li>
<li> I just have to applaud Paul Mitchell for GREAT hair products WITHOUT conducting cruel, unnecessary animal experiments!</li>
<li> Hope it never goes away, as I&#x27;ll have a hard time finding another product that works for me like this one.</li>
<li> Hard to wash off hands.</li>
<li> they kinda changed this product tho as it was really thick</li>
<li> It&#x27;s thick and sticky.</li>
<li> You don&#x27;t look like a wet head and it doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant like pomade.</li>
<li> Sometimes I like to pull half of my hair up but have hated how my hair looks so frizzy.  </li>

    <li> Shipped quick, though the price has gone up quite a bit recently. Amazon previously sold two for this price, now you just get one.  Price and the convenience is still worth it though.</li>
    <li> I live in a somewhat humid climate and my hair tends to curl on the lower parts underneath my ears and by my neck.  Sometimes I like to pull half of my hair up but have hated how my hair looks so frizzy.  No matter how I styled it, it always looked messy.  I have tried so many products, serums, you name it.  This product is the only product that will tame those frizzies and give me the style I want.  I learned to style my hair first and then at the end apply a small amount as a finishing touch.  I love how my hair looks and how this product works.</li>
    <li> Have medium length wavy hair.  Use this product daily before styling and it works great and no frizz.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Other hair wax left my hair with an odd feel and I couldnt get it styled the way I wanted.  The Paul Mitchell Wax Works is gentle enough to work with in my hair and holds my style without being stiff.  I dont have to wash it each day after sleeping and gettin a \\&quot;bed head\\&quot;.  It stills looks nice the 2nd day with just a touch up style.</li>
    <li> I love this wax! It&#x27;s not very flexible, but it tames hair and makes it manageable and shiny. Very good!</li>
    <li> I just have to applaud Paul Mitchell for GREAT hair products WITHOUT conducting cruel, unnecessary animal experiments! I won&#x27;t use products that are tested on animals so I was very happy to see that \\&quot;John Paul Mitchell Systems does not conduct or endorse animal testing.\\&quot; I have a pixie cut and I use Slick Works, Re-Works, and &#x27;Freeze and Shine Super Spray.&#x27; Great products.</li>
    <li> but it is not coming out as well when I do it myself at home.  It is sticky, and pulls my hair style out of place when I put it on.  It does dry soft, and shiney with great hold, but I just don&#x27;t like the way my hair sticks to my hands when I put it on.</li>
    <li> Where has this product been all my life. Keeps my hair manageable without being stiff. Love this product. Will buy again for sure</li>
    <li> Great stuff-be careful and don&#x27;t use to much.  Not good for fine hair but great for my short gray hair.  Nice and spiky.  Wonderful stuff.</li>
    <li> If you flat iron your hair or tie it back wet, when I flat iron my hair I use this on my palms and pin down the fly away baby hairs but you must get the extreme they kinda changed this product tho as it was really thick not the medium it was the strong one but it have a different name then extreme but it should be thick like tooth paste when you put it on your palms if its to dry you add a few drops of water then pin down it is great dries like gel but leaves a silky finish.</li>
    <li> Recently I have had difficulty finding this product in salons and retail stores so was delighted to find this source.  The delivery service was good.</li>
    <li> The product is exactly what I normally buy in a barber shop. It is extremely convenient to have it on auto-ship.</li>
    <li> I love the product but the purchase price was not the same as the advertised price, it was actually higher. I was a little disappointed in that, but I purchased the product anyway and really liked it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is not for me .. sticky .. just a waste of money as it went in the trash</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and love it. It is convenient to be able to order it on-line from a reputable company. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Just enough hold to make my short hair much more interesting (!) and washes off my hands easily. It is not too heavy.</li>
    <li> This product meets my needs perfectly.  Hope it never goes away, as I&#x27;ll have a hard time finding another product that works for me like this one.</li>
    <li> A good hair product.  Great hold and shine.  For me the only draw back is it needs to be applied on dry hair.  I prefer hair products that can be applied on damp towel-dried hair.  But otherwise does a good job!</li>
    <li> Best hair holding product out there</li>
    <li> Try it and you&#x27;ll never go back to the old stuff.  Way better than gel. You can restyle your hair throughout the day without losing the hold.  You don&#x27;t look like a wet head and it doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant like pomade.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> My husband has wild curly hair that needs taming and it helps but then we get crunchiness. It&#x27;s thick and sticky. Hard to wash off hands. Then I looked at the ingredients and its packed with Parabens and all the other can Cancer causing ingredients. We will just have to keep looking for something with safe ingredients that will tame his hair.</li>
