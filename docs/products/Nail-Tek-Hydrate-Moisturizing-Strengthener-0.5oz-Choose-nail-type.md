      <li>in nail products doesn&#x27;t bother me very much, but I know it is very important to some users of nail products who prefer formaldehyde-free products, so if you are one of those, this may not be the product for you.</li>

      <li>they are soft and they peel and split.</li>
      <li>Peeling was a major issue with my nails, but this product stopped that, giving immediate and visible results.  </li>
      <li>As a clear polish by itself though, it has worn well and not turned my nails yellow.</li>
      <li>It has taken about 8 months, but finally the damage on my nails has completely grown out.</li>
      <li>this product was recommended to me by a nail artist, for my nails that are soft and keep peeling.&lt;br /&gt;i used similar product by national brands to no avail.&lt;br</li>

<li> For months, the layers of my nails continued to separate and peel off from the tips so badly I was afraid I would have to get fake nails just to protect them.</li>

<li> The description says this can be used as a base coat, however I do not recommend it for that purpose.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product because the results are super-fast.  My nails look and feel better overnight, no joke.  Nail growth is accelerated into overdrive, and new nail growth is shiny and strong, while existing nail is smoothed and visibly improved.  Peeling was a major issue with my nails, but this product stopped that, giving immediate and visible results.  All in all I am very happy with this product but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FORMALDEHYDE-PHOBES BEWARE:  THIS PRODUCT DOES CONTAIN FORMALDEHYDE.  NOT JUST FORMALDEHYDE RESIN...FORMALDEHYDE IS LISTED AS A SEPARATE AND DISTINCT INGREDIENT IN THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formaldehyde in nail products doesn&#x27;t bother me very much, but I know it is very important to some users of nail products who prefer formaldehyde-free products, so if you are one of those, this may not be the product for you.</li>
    <li> It will take time to see if it will help. It has only been a couple weeks and that isn&#x27;t enough time to tell...</li>
    <li> I used other NailTek products in the past and was generally happy. This one has exceeded my expectations. I wore acrylic for a few years on and off to disguise my soft and hence extremely short nails. Decided to give the Hydration Therapy a try and was not disappointed so far. For the first couple weeks used it alone and it did not peel at all. Then I tried using it as both base and top coat with Opi nail color, it didn&#x27;t peel either. And I did dishes a few times too. I didn&#x27;t notice a rapid nail growth, but stronger nails is an achievement by itself.</li>
    <li> I found that Nailtex  products are the best for natural nails.  I refuse to use anything else, and everyone cannot believe that my nails are my own.  I recommend if you want nice natural nails do not use anything else, because I have tried them all.</li>
    <li> this product was recommended to me by a nail artist, for my nails that are soft and keep peeling.&lt;br /&gt;i used similar product by national brands to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;it has to be applied daily especially on the tips of the nails. after a week remove with nail polish remover and repeat (daily application).&lt;br /&gt;better than anything else i used, well known in nail salons, enabled me finally to grow nails longer than the skin line.&lt;br /&gt;it comes also in colors. i like it clear.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s only 0.5 ounce but enough for 2-3 months. close tight or it becomes thick, and will not dry quick.</li>
    <li> Wonderful however a bit expensive and I do have anything else to say about it except it worked very very well...</li>
    <li> I read reviews from multiple sites and saw very few negatives so I purchased. As I have now used the product, my experience is in line with those few negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for about three weeks and my experience is that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) This wears off and peels off over the course of a few hours. Some hand washing, but still... It&#x27;s gone from the first third of my nails where the peeling is so frequent reapplication is absolutely required;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) I get a new odd chip in at least two nails every day, so I&#x27;m filing or clipping every day: and,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) My nails peel WITH this on but, because of the formaldehyde, the peeling is deeper--if I peel it. So I have to do a full remove, file, re-apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would neither repurchase nor recommend this. I really want my money back as this absolutely did not deliver.</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in my nails as of yet. they are soft and they peel and split. i thought this might help but i will continue to use it and hopefully i will see something</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been only using this Nail-Tek for three (3) weeks now and it works, period.  My nails were always long and this past winter they seem to go to H-E-L-L- ON  a one (1) wing airplane, splitting, chipping and cracking.  Never before did I experience this and I found it exceedingly annoying.  I purchased from Nordstroms a nail-filler and that made a complete mess of my nails.  I found this &#x27;stuff &#x27; and presently it appears to be doing everything the 5* STAR folks are proclaiming it does.  EXPENSIVE, BUT take a chance.</li>
    <li> When I first reviewed this product I gave it a negative review. After using it for a few week,  have changed my opinion. My nails went from breaking, to growing and healthy! It works!</li>
    <li> The brush for applying the product was not perfect.  But a good buy for the money.  i say it is a buy!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing- within a week my nails are growing strong and healthy!</li>
    <li> This is my new miracle polish - goes on nice and dries quickly - not really like a polish, but more like a deep hydrating gel coat that dries quickly. Love it.  You will have to start cutting your nails, they just wont break or split anymore!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom because her nails kept peeling and breaking. After one month of continuous use we have seen no changes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on and off for years - - My nails aren&#x27;t good and this has worked the best for me of anything I&#x27;ve tried .  in the past it has worked well and my nails are good for about a year and then it seems to need a rest - - - recently they are the worst they have been and tried something else that really dried my nails so decided I needed to go back to the Hydration Therapy - I do feel I&#x27;m getting results but it has only been a couple weeks; however know in the past I&#x27;ve had very good results.</li>
    <li> I quit using this after about 3 weeks when my nails started peeling instead of getting stronger. For months, the layers of my nails continued to separate and peel off from the tips so badly I was afraid I would have to get fake nails just to protect them. It has taken about 8 months, but finally the damage on my nails has completely grown out. Everyone&#x27;s nails are different and react to products differently - just like hair. So stop using this product immediately if you see signs of damage - I wish I stopped sooner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this ever since I took off my fake nails back in the early 90&#x27;s.  Turns out I have great nails and this this product is awesome!</li>
    <li> Use as directed and your nails will be long and strong in no time.  Will for sure order again.</li>
    <li> Just as described and quick service</li>
    <li> My nails are hard enough, but peel at the ends once they get to a certain length.  This product sort of impregnates the nail and seals those peeling bits until your nail grows out a little and you can file the damaged parts off.  I love this product...it saved my nails!  I&#x27;m using the Ridge Filler II over this product before I polish.  They work great together.</li>
    <li> The description says this can be used as a base coat, however I do not recommend it for that purpose. I&#x27;ve tried using it as a base for a few different brands of colored polish and the results have been the same, the color layers peel within a day. As a clear polish by itself though, it has worn well and not turned my nails yellow.</li>
