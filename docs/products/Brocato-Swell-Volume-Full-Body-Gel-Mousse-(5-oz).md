      <li>Have not found one that works better.  </li>
      <li>Love love love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love with the manageability of hair when I use Brocato Gel Mousse</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and NOTHING gives it more body and hold than this product.  </li>
      <li>Gel that turns into a Mouse - this is great for short hair when it starts to grow out and needs more body than hold control.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for more than five years and always keep a full container of it along with the one I am using.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice light hold which holds my curls, leaves hair VERY shiny, and I like the smell!</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this leaves it controlled and gives it a lot of volume as it grows out.</li>

      <li>Just rub it between hands and spread thru hair, blow dry and about good to go.</li>

      <li>However, I normally use just a shaping brush and go more au natural with my hair style.  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many products that promise volume, but this is the product that actually meets my expectations.  </li>
      <li>first time using this....like it, long time Brocato shampoo user so far so good....</li>
      <li>This is the first time i have use this Mousse and i would purchase it again</li>
      <li>Amazon not only had the product in stock at a cost lower than I paid originally, but they shipped it right away with no problems.  </li>
      <li>so much I had to reorder</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
      <li>but when I use this product, I really like how it feels.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use much mousse</li>
      <li>i really like it.</li>
      <li>With this in mind I will say the product was delivered in a very timely manner and packed well.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really add the body and fullness</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products, and they just don&#x27;t compare.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend Amazon.</li>
      <li>It is not heavy or sticky unless you use too much.</li>
      <li>This happens over and over to all of us, trying new products that a costly but don&#x27;t work as well as we think they should.  </li>
      <li>While I have used Broccoto Swell Volume for about a year now, I was having a problem purchasing a new can.  </li>
      <li>I am a senior lady and have tried many beauty products during my lifetime, and have had to get rid of well over half of them, so I guess it&#x27;s all in what works for any given individual.</li>
      <li>I will not use this product and think Amazon should make this information CLEAR before purchase.  </li>
      <li>It holds and gives volume better then other products I have used so far, I recommend this for fine thin hair.</li>
      <li>Based on other reviewers&#x27; comments, I had very high hopes for this product to replace BioSilk Mousse.  </li>
      <li>When I let it dry naturally for a scrunched, wavy look, it doesn&#x27;t go flat.  </li>

<li> When I let it dry naturally for a scrunched, wavy look, it doesn&#x27;t go flat.  </li>

<li> Hair feels thicker after use, especially when I blow dry hair after using it.</li>
<li> This combination of products just doesn&#x27;t work as well as two products I have used in combination for a long, long time:  </li>
<li> I apply it to wet hair and have short hair.</li>
<li> I have fine, thin hair, and have trouble finding a thickening product that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like steel wool.  </li>
<li> When I blow dry my hair and style it with a curling iron it works well.  </li>
<li> wit a little Blonde Swell.  </li>
<li> Considering how expensive this product is, I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.  </li>
<li> You just use it on wet hair and blow dry with a round brush.  </li>
<li> gel, just a little bit, followed by Biosilk Mousse.  </li>
<li> so I&#x27;ve spent a ton on finding a product that at least will make it feel and look fuller.</li>
<li> usually buy this from my stylist.</li>
<li> Mine does not come out as a foam but a extemely thick liquid.</li>
<li> you need a very small amount.</li>
<li> I have badly thinning hair with this female pattern hair loss.</li>

    <li> I have tried so many products that promise volume, but this is the product that actually meets my expectations.  I recommend it for anyone with fine hair!!!</li>
    <li> It holds and gives volume better then other products I have used so far, I recommend this for fine thin hair.</li>
    <li> dispenses goo, rather than mousse!</li>
    <li> This product is a must to have.I give this 5 stars</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair.  When I use this product I always get compliments.  You just use it on wet hair and blow dry with a round brush.  It&#x27;s the best ever!</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised. Brocato gel mousse works fantastic for my hair which is thin ans wavy.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair, and have trouble finding a thickening product that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like steel wool.  This product is great!</li>
    <li> Love these products, they work so eel my Husband noticed,miracle!l</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and NOTHING gives it more body and hold than this product.  When I style with heat rollers, my hair looks great all day.  When I let it dry naturally for a scrunched, wavy look, it doesn&#x27;t go flat.  I&#x27;ve tried many other products, and they just don&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> The product smells awesome and given hair great volume I haven&#x27;t been able to find with other products. I use it to make my hair curly and use a diffuser to style my hair. Works like a charm!  I just wish the bottle was bigger!</li>
    <li> Gel that turns into a Mouse - this is great for short hair when it starts to grow out and needs more body than hold control. I have fine hair and this leaves it controlled and gives it a lot of volume as it grows out. I hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> I have badly thinning hair with this female pattern hair loss. Nothing is going to regrow it so I&#x27;ve spent a ton on finding a product that at least will make it feel and look fuller. FINALLY found this! It has a nice light hold which holds my curls, leaves hair VERY shiny, and I like the smell! This better never be discontinued! 10 stars!</li>
    <li> The delivery was great. The problem was the product. I have used this for years, not in mousse form, and loved it. Mine does not come out as a foam but a extemely thick liquid. I cannot control the amount that comes out so I get enough for 5 to 6 uses. I was hoping I would be able to replace the old product with this one. I guess not.</li>
    <li> Use this after every hair wash. Hair feels thicker after use, especially when I blow dry hair after using it. Cheaper than at the hairdresser.</li>
    <li> I tried this mousse while on vacation.  The only thing is that it leaves hair a little stiff as most other mousses do.  It gives my hair (which is curly) nice hold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years..helps a bit to hold the curl</li>
    <li> I ordered this expecting a gel, which I&#x27;ve had before, but what came is a mousse.</li>
    <li> This product does miracles</li>
    <li> I like the product...you need a very small amount. It comes out as a gel and when rubbed between your hands it turns into a foam. It is not heavy or sticky unless you use too much. I recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This is the first time i have use this Mousse and i would purchase it again i really like it.</li>
    <li> While I have used Broccoto Swell Volume for about a year now, I was having a problem purchasing a new can.  Amazon not only had the product in stock at a cost lower than I paid originally, but they shipped it right away with no problems.  Highly recommend Amazon.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product about 7 years ago. Brocato products have on their container the things that this product can do for your hair to make a very good end result.  I needed a stronger hold on my hair style, so I added another product to this mousse.  I moved to another state and city.  I was glad that I could get this product online instead of  one salon&#x27;s sporadic supply.</li>
    <li> Based on other reviewers&#x27; comments, I had very high hopes for this product to replace BioSilk Mousse.  I preceeded (the Swell Volume wit a little Blonde Swell.  When I blow dry my hair and style it with a curling iron it works well.  However, I normally use just a shaping brush and go more au natural with my hair style.  This combination of products just doesn&#x27;t work as well as two products I have used in combination for a long, long time:  Hold It! gel, just a little bit, followed by Biosilk Mousse.  Those do a better job for me.  Considering how expensive this product is, I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.  It is better than nothing, but that is about all.  It doesn&#x27;t really add the body and fullness I am looking for.  I likely will end up giving it away as [another] freebie in a garage sale.  This happens over and over to all of us, trying new products that a costly but don&#x27;t work as well as we think they should.  I am a senior lady and have tried many beauty products during my lifetime, and have had to get rid of well over half of them, so I guess it&#x27;s all in what works for any given individual.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff. I love with the manageability of hair when I use Brocato Gel Mousse so much I had to reorder so I didn&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Please read the warning on the back of can: This product contains chemicals known to cause cancer by the State of California.  There is no warning prior to purchase....wish I had the opportunity to know this PRIOR to purchase.  I will not use this product and think Amazon should make this information CLEAR before purchase.  With this in mind I will say the product was delivered in a very timely manner and packed well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for more than five years and always keep a full container of it along with the one I am using.  Have not found one that works better.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this...but don&#x27;t use too much because then hair feels tacky.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use much mousse but when I use this product, I really like how it feels.&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy this from my stylist.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Doesn&#x27;t take much. I apply it to wet hair and have short hair. Just rub it between hands and spread thru hair, blow dry and about good to go.</li>
    <li> first time using this....like it, long time Brocato shampoo user so far so good....great job in packaging.</li>
    <li> nothing great, doesn&#x27;t smell very good and feels kind of tacky on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;i won&#x27;t buy again from this manufacturere, however the seller&#x27;s were GREAT</li>
