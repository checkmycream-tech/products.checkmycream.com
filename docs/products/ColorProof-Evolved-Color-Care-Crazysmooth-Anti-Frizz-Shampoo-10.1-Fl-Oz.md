      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Always leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy</li>
      <li>my favorite shampoo</li>
      <li>and I have tried many of them.  </li>
      <li>This was recommended to me by my hairdresser but would have cost a lot more.</li>
      <li>I love these products.  </li>
      <li>They work well and are more affordable on Amazon rather than buying them from my hairdresser.  </li>
      <li>It is ok, but I like the purple colorproof shampoo better.</li>
      <li>Love this product and always is shiped on time:)</li>
      <li>I love both.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent -</li>
      <li>it is fabulous!</li>
      <li>The shampoo lathers into an amazing rich foam.</li>
      <li>The main scents in both being warm, sweet, and spicy.&lt;br /&gt;I bought both for my mom for Christmas when she told me my hair smelled great.</li>
      <li>Once I hit my 40&#x27;s my beautiful soft hair started turning frizzy.  </li>
      <li>Lovely smell &amp; rinses out easily.</li>
      <li>Sure does keep the frizz away, clean , smooth , shiny hair !</li>
      <li>The best part is it&#x27;s free of junk that other shampoos have that can get into your skin/bloodstream (Sulfates, parabens, etc).</li>
      <li>it gets super frizzy and I have colored my hair a lot!</li>
      <li>I was a huge fan of Pureology hair products until I read a review about ColorProof.</li>
      <li>I still prefer the ColorProof SuperRich Moisture shampoo in terms of ability to cleanse, texture of my hair after use, AND it smells fabulous.  </li>
      <li>However, this shampoo is fantastic.</li>
      <li>So far so good - like the shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite right now.</li>
      <li>It has a nice lather, however, and makes you feel like you&#x27;re really getting your hair and scalp clean.</li>
      <li>My head feels super clean and grime free.</li>
      <li>but really If It&#x27;s A 10 with Moroccan Oil works better.</li>
      <li>My hair feels, and smells, fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s SUPER concentrated.</li>
      <li>While this product isnt better than any hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried, it is definitely towards the top.</li>
      <li>Works good, kind of thick for a shampoo.</li>
      <li>Leaves her hair soft, full and healthy.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft smooth and extremely easy to style.</li>
      <li>but well worth the money if you are fed up with frizz.</li>
      <li>Great product love that it makes my hair so silky smooth also a little goes a long way</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner shower up pretty quickly too.</li>
      <li>smell is warm, sweet, light, and a little spicy.</li>
      <li>it lathers well and leaves a slight but pleasant tingle to my scalp.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is also slightly fruity (like citrus) and the conditioner is a little more earthy (like sandalwood) and they go brilliantly together.</li>
      <li>No shampoo will completely control frizz, but this is a great &amp;#34;step 1&amp;#34; before the addition of other products and heat styling.</li>
      <li>When I tried it for the first time, I squeezed some in my hand and rubbed my hands together.</li>
      <li>this shampoo leaves my hair soft and frizz free.</li>
      <li>I have never ordered a shampoo or conditioner without smelling it first, but I went out on a limb with this one.</li>
      <li>I normally shampoo twice, but only needed one shampoo with this one because it lathered up so nicely.</li>
      <li>It did leave my hair feeling soft and smooth though.</li>
      <li>Protects your color treated hair and leaves it feeling soft and clean.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very slimy, which I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
      <li>I have very frizzy hair that I color and have chemically straightened.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent of this product.</li>
      <li>Living in a warmer and more humid climate, this product helps keep my straight hair from going limp and frizzy.</li>
      <li>I will use this shampoo but won&#x27;t reorder this particular one again.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it to any user.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend to anyone.  </li>
      <li>my hair has felt so much healthier and the frizz is completely gone almost.</li>
      <li>After a few times it gets even better.</li>
      <li>Nice and thick creamy shampoo I like it</li>
      <li>I have wavy curly hair that many times I like to blow dry or use a flat iron.</li>
      <li>It plus the conditioner knock back the old lady frizz right now.</li>
      <li>The product is so rich you&#x27;ll use half of what you normally use.</li>
      <li>My hair is silky and soft.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly/frizzy hair</li>
      <li>I surprised myself by investing in it.</li>
      <li>because WOW.</li>
      <li>I use in conjunction with the ColorProof anti-frizz conditioner and together, my hair feels soft and is not frizzy.</li>
      <li>It really smooths your hair and helps your color last.</li>
      <li>but thats the only good thing about this expensive shampoo..</li>
      <li>I live in a dry climate ...</li>
      <li>I have been looking literally for years for a color shampoo that lathers and easily washes out of my very thick hair.  </li>

    <li> Nice and thick creamy shampoo I like it</li>
    <li> MY WIFE SAID IT WAS GREAT FOR THE PRICE.  SHE LOVES IT.</li>
    <li> great product--packaged well</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, perfect!</li>
    <li> it might work for some people but it just made my hair feeling dry and brittle. beware future buyers. i like the smell but thats the only good thing about this expensive shampoo..</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate ... This stuff is awesome ... My hair is silky and soft.  Also a little goes a long way... The product is so rich you&#x27;ll use half of what you normally use.</li>
    <li> Sure does keep the frizz away, clean , smooth , shiny hair ! I learned about this product from a sample..</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  A little goes a long way.  Protects your color treated hair and leaves it feeling soft and clean.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Yes I love this product and the price - and it arrived quicker than I imagined!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the pink bottle shown and was sent the purple one. Not happy the purple bottle does not hold down my frizz</li>
    <li> Turned onto this product by my hairdresser.  Best shampoo I have EVER used.  Always leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy (I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s now) and does not leave build up.  Would highly recommend to anyone.  Scent is nice as well.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product for your hair!  Optimum results when used with ColorProof CrazySmooth Anti-Frizz Condition.  Love the scent - it is fabulous!</li>
    <li> Once I hit my 40&#x27;s my beautiful soft hair started turning frizzy.  Nothing has worked until now.  Just a tiny dollop in my hand is enough; it suds up like crazy.  I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments since I started using it as well!</li>
    <li> I am so thankfull that I found this product. I was a huge fan of Pureology hair products until I read a review about ColorProof. I have thinner hair but after I shower and blow dry it it gets super frizzy and I have colored my hair a lot! Ever since I started using ColorProof Anti-Frizz my hair has felt so much healthier and the frizz is completely gone almost. It is amazing and I am one happy customer! Same goes for the condition. I will forever be a ColorProof user until something even better comes across my path. The shampoo and conditioner shower up pretty quickly too. I have it in my Save For Later area so I can order it from the same seller each time.</li>
    <li> Works great and cheaper then the salon!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for colored hair and I have tried many of them.  This was recommended to me by my hairdresser but would have cost a lot more.</li>
    <li> I love these products.  They work well and are more affordable on Amazon rather than buying them from my hairdresser.  I won&#x27;t use anyting else!</li>
    <li> Love this product! It really smooths your hair and helps your color last. Doesn&#x27;t make hair greasy like some smoothing products I have used before.</li>
    <li> When I tried it for the first time, I squeezed some in my hand and rubbed my hands together. It&#x27;s very slimy, which I didn&#x27;t like. It has a nice lather, however, and makes you feel like you&#x27;re really getting your hair and scalp clean. I normally shampoo twice, but only needed one shampoo with this one because it lathered up so nicely. I don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent of this product. It did leave my hair feeling soft and smooth though.</li>
    <li> This shampoo helps tame down my frizzy hair especially in the humid weather we have.</li>
    <li> This is a good anti-frizz shampoo. I use in conjunction with the ColorProof anti-frizz conditioner and together, my hair feels soft and is not frizzy. Good price too, I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy hair that I color and have chemically straightened. this shampoo leaves my hair soft and frizz free. it lathers well and leaves a slight but pleasant tingle to my scalp. Not a huge fan of the scent, thus the 4 stars, but it&#x27;s not so bad that I can not use the shampoo:)</li>
    <li> I liked it alot but really If It&#x27;s A 10 with Moroccan Oil works better. However Colorproof anti frizz leave in conditioner and the colorproof Crazy Extreme Shine are my stables now would use nothing else.</li>
    <li> amazing shampoo- decreases frizz- i have thick hair-smell is amazing- a little goes a long way-it is pricey but worth it</li>
    <li> I have wavy curly hair that many times I like to blow dry or use a flat iron. They use this line at my Salon so I bought here.&lt;br /&gt;It is awesome!! Makes my hair soft smooth and extremely easy to style. The style also holds well even into the next day or two!! Love this line!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite right now. It plus the conditioner knock back the old lady frizz right now. After a few times it gets even better.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this product. It is nothing like product sold in salons or department stores</li>
    <li> Great product way cheaper then the salon</li>
    <li> smells good, lathers nicely and works well.</li>
    <li> Leaves her hair soft, full and healthy. A great replacement for the Pureology brand. Would highly recommend it to any user.</li>
    <li> So far so good - like the shampoo.  Lovely smell &amp; rinses out easily.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of controlling frizz and won&#x27;t wash out color.  No shampoo will completely control frizz, but this is a great &amp;#34;step 1&amp;#34; before the addition of other products and heat styling.</li>
    <li> I have never ordered a shampoo or conditioner without smelling it first, but I went out on a limb with this one. I LOVE it! The shampoo lathers into an amazing rich foam. The conditioner is smoothing and has helped with my frizz. I love both.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is warm, sweet, light, and a little spicy. The shampoo is also slightly fruity (like citrus) and the conditioner is a little more earthy (like sandalwood) and they go brilliantly together. The main scents in both being warm, sweet, and spicy.&lt;br /&gt;I bought both for my mom for Christmas when she told me my hair smelled great. She loves them now too</li>
    <li> This product line is wonderful. I surprised myself by investing in it. Pricey but well worth the money if you are fed up with frizz.</li>
    <li> 1 star off for price- because WOW. However, this shampoo is fantastic. I was used to getting, what I consider &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34; dandruff, especially the second day if I did not wash my hair before. This shampoo did away with all of that after THREE washes. It&#x27;s SUPER concentrated. Mine came with a pump and it takes HALF a pump  do do my head (I only wash scalp but have extremely thick hair). It lasts forever. The best part is it&#x27;s free of junk that other shampoos have that can get into your skin/bloodstream (Sulfates, parabens, etc). My head feels super clean and grime free.</li>
    <li> It is ok, but I like the purple colorproof shampoo better.</li>
    <li> Works good, kind of thick for a shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great product love that it makes my hair so silky smooth also a little goes a long way my favorite shampoo</li>
    <li> I have been looking literally for years for a color shampoo that lathers and easily washes out of my very thick hair.  The shampoo, conditioner and serum are absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> While this product isnt better than any hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried, it is definitely towards the top. Id buy again. It is definitely salon quality. The price is a little high.</li>
    <li> Great product! Perfect for frizzy hair or humid days!</li>
    <li> Love this product and always is shiped on time:)</li>
    <li> I agree with some of the other posters that the smell is mildly unpleasant but it disappears once it&#x27;s rinsed out of your hair.  My hair feels, and smells, fresh and clean.  I have naturally curly/frizzy hair and I don&#x27;t notice any difference in the &amp;#34;frizz factor&amp;#34; after using this shampoo.  I still prefer the ColorProof SuperRich Moisture shampoo in terms of ability to cleanse, texture of my hair after use, AND it smells fabulous.  I will use this shampoo but won&#x27;t reorder this particular one again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist. Love this product. Smooths hair without weighing it down. Shiny, healthy hair!</li>
    <li> Living in a warmer and more humid climate, this product helps keep my straight hair from going limp and frizzy.</li>
