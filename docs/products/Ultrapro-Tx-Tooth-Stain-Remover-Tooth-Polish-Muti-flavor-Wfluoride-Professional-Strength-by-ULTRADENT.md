<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Too dry to work well with my tooth polisher.</li>
    <li> Pretty good at whitening but if you have gingervitis I would not recommend this product. It will recede your gum lines just like whitening strips. So beaware. Also it comes with no directions.</li>
    <li> does a good job,  but not with the AZDENT toodth polished.  Works well with my electric toohbrush, especially to clean plague build-up on back side of lower front teeth.  polished teeth very well--nice and smooth!</li>
    <li> for my dogs it works great.</li>
    <li> When used with my electric toothbrush it does an excellent job in removing coffee stains and whitening.</li>
    <li> This tooth stain remover/polish kit is a waste of money. Just get your teeth professionally cleaned.</li>
    <li> good product, slow shipping from Amazon.</li>
    <li> item as expected, works great</li>
    <li> Do not buy this crap! it is old and dried out.</li>
    <li> really clean my teeth</li>
    <li> was all dried up cant use  I got ripped</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the dye used in this polish...and I can&#x27;t tell any difference in the appearance of my teeth.</li>
    <li> It works temporarily, in a couple of days your teeth look the same.</li>
    <li> Tastes pretty good, and work really well with my tooth polisher to remove stains</li>
    <li> This is the same stuff the dentists use.  It&#x27;ll keep my teeth clean without a dentist bill.</li>
    <li> These are good.  I love the taste.</li>
    <li> These work amazingly well!!! I had some dark stains showing up on my teeth from drinking soda(I assume) and I used one of the 10 packets of this polish with an electric toothbrush and it was a night and day difference. It removed almost all the imperfections in my teeth. I think one more time in about a week and they will look perfect!</li>
    <li> It works better than I expected, but it&#x27;s dry. Add a few drops of water before you apply it to your brush. It def cleans well but I didn&#x27;t see any crazy good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works. Wouldn&#x27;t use too often as it&#x27;s very abrasive.</li>
    <li> I happy to have this product....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m already seeing whiter teeth.  So far, I love it!</li>
    <li> just like the dentist has...tastes good and polishes well for touch ups in between dental visits</li>
    <li> This does very well if you let it soak in or leave it on your teeth a few more minutes. Arrived nicely packed.</li>
    <li> these tubs are about 1/4 inch diameter. they are tiny</li>
    <li> I would use it once a month only&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite abracisive.</li>
    <li> This goes perfect with my tooth polishing kit.</li>
    <li> It would probably work better if the polisher worked.</li>
    <li> Ok - Cleaned my teath well - should have an assortment&lt;br /&gt;pack of (2) Coarse/(6) Med/ though - - Coarse for the&lt;br /&gt;first cleaning &amp; med . for maintenance.</li>
    <li> Patience, deep stains take time. This polish leaves your teeth and mouth feeling whiter, brighter and cleaner. For those who like a clean mouth.&lt;br /&gt;It has become my daily brush substance.</li>
    <li> these are about the size of a pencil eraser and are all dried up, can&#x27;t even use....waste of time and money</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re bigger than an eraser as another user had said, there&#x27;s probably enough to cover a few toothbrushes per unit, but it was soooo dry that application of the stuff was made difficult simply as it refused to spread evenly.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt, this is the best stain remover and whitener that I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s a SUPER value as well. THANK YOU for the wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS To make it softer just add a drop or two of water on the cake before brushing.</li>
    <li> I love that I can buy these, for a once in a while stain c l eaning, they work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Really whitens the teeth</li>
    <li> Very good like very much makes teeth look whiter everybody says teeth look really white would buy again thank you</li>
    <li> Works very well definitely a good buy have always wanted to do this for myself and my kids and came fairly quick</li>
    <li> I was totally intrigued by the &amp;#34;Walterberry&amp;#34; selection (aka strawberry) but I was happy with this purchase.  Works great with my Oratek tooth polisher and the grit is good.  After just one use you can tell your overall tooth/gum health is just like after a dental cleaning.</li>
    <li> This tooth paste, stain remover, does not seem on par with that used by my dental hygienist. The containers are too small to really get your brush into them. Consequently, it&#x27;s hard to get enough onto your teeth to really feel like you are cleaning them.</li>
    <li> use it once a week.  brush or flux with it to clean some spots and work well.</li>
    <li> these are really great with the tooth tool to sand the teeth...it does help get rid of any brown areas...you wont be disappointed</li>
    <li> Product was useful and helps between visits to the dentist!  Great product!  Would order again!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to use this product!</li>
    <li> A trip to dentist from home!  Good polished.  Would like it better if mint flavored only in a blush tint :) Very dry and small amounts.</li>
    <li> Works great with the Sonicare electric toothbrush, but it will wear out the brush bristles.  Might be a good idea to save some of the old brushes so you can use them when you use this polish.  I used this on a relatively new brush head and it made the light blue wear indicator white, just after one cleaning.  The polish is pretty hard, so you will need something to scoop out this gritty paste.  You might want to thin this down with a bit of toothpaste so it will stay on the brush and not fall off.  This is an abrasive, so you don&#x27;t want to use this that often otherwise you might wear down the enamel of your teeth.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the dental hygienist paste, but pretty good. The paste is a little dry, so you have to have your brush or polisher pretty wet.</li>
    <li> Polishing teeth is good for looks, bad for enamel</li>
    <li> Feel like a pro using this product. Just like at the dentist. Probably could use regular toothpaste however not the same clean feeling like dentist.</li>
    <li> Just like what is used at the dentist</li>
    <li> Works great with a tooth polisher to get stains off your teeth from caffeinated drinks or cigarettes.  Different flavors and you can use one for a long time.  Just put the cover back on and keep sealed.</li>
    <li> Bought this to go with our battery operated tooth polisher. Product worked really well at removing stains and shinning teeth. Hubby even uses it on his dentures. Doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty taste or residue</li>
    <li> The product came to me very hard and dry, like it was old and I had to add water just to use it. Still very clumpy. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> just like the tooth polisher he loved the flavors it came with he used it right a way get one</li>
    <li> They were all dried up when we opened them! And, they are small, micro small!!! Will NOT purchase again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I suggest purchasing the Oratek Tooth Polisher Whitener Burnisher  (or something similar) with this product as they compliment each other well.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use a product to help me keep up with not going to the dentist as often as I should. Great flavors and easy to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be soft and it&#x27;s hard as a rock and difficult to get on your tooth polisher.  I will be contacting the company for a refund or another shipment as I wonder if this batch just dried out.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, but the assortment sent was 2 mint 2 orange and 6 wallerberry..No bubble gum.. mint and bubble gum were the ones I mainly wanted. Not sure if I would reorder since I did not receive what was advertised.</li>
    <li> I tried this and just found it to be okay. Mint tasted fine but a little bland and I found the consistency to be difficult to use but it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dried up&amp;#34; like other reviewers have said. It is just a little thick and gummy; you can use a round brush like I did or get something to pull it out of the container.  I could feel the abrasives against my teeth like I feel at the dentist but it was pretty mild in comparison. I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in how my teeth looked but they did feel very clean but I use a sonic brush and keep them very clean anyway. I did not see any change in the color or whiteness of my teeth. This is not a horrible product and not so bad that I want waste time trying to get my money back, but not something I will buy again. I will probably finish the other 7 containers over the next year or so unless they dry out and maybe it will do better next time.  Its not a bad price if you want to try this yourself, and maybe someone whose teeth are less cared for would find the product&#x27;s action to be good. So I&#x27;m not going to say absolutely don&#x27;t buy this product, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.  I plan to search for other products and continue to see my dental hygienist twice a year for my &amp;#34;deep-cleaning&amp;#34; needs.</li>
    <li> I will use it come soon. I hope to be very good.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Cleans and tastes great too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find this has helped much at all.  I use it with my Sonicare toothbrush (Diamond heads) - on the Polish setting.  I will not be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Terrible waste of money!</li>
    <li> Still waiting for my polisher but worked well with my manual tooth brush. Pods are very small, and only used a partial pod. Pods are not resealable.. so may dry out between uses.</li>
    <li> no flavor, dry, won&#x27;t be using</li>
    <li> Works very well. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> not happy with small amount of product for the price.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel smooth after using this</li>
    <li> this product helps a lot to take off stains</li>
    <li> Works just like the product at the dentist office .</li>
    <li> Removed smoking stains in one use. Great stuff, I used it with my electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> package arrived and all the cells must have leaked, product is hard as a rock!</li>
    <li> love this - works so well - I hope the price comes down, because it&#x27;s kind of addictive to use, and I would use it after every brushing if it cost a little less!</li>
    <li> I liked them all except the orange. Yuck. But they do the trick cleaning the teeth of stains between dental visits. I use it on a sonic toothbrush every few weeks to maintain a polish on my teeth.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  My teeth are just as clean and shiny as they are when I go to the dentist!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where this is considered professional grade or medium grit. It&#x27;s no coarser than a baking soda polish. It&#x27;s also very hard and dry, but when you apply it, it dissolves into foam and does no real polishing beyond what a standard tooth polish would do. On top of that, of the 10 I received, 5 of them were &amp;#34;Walterberry,&amp;#34; which is disgusting in both taste and color. Since it&#x27;s no better at cleaning than standard drugstore tooth polish, and yet you get only a small amount, AND it tastes terrible, it&#x27;s a very, very poor value. Can&#x27;t recommend it, and won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> The day I received it I opened one to use and it was totally dry and hard.</li>
    <li> The tips are of poor quality. This just did not work for me. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> The product is ok but I did not like my random assortment.  I would have preferred more mint flavors versus fruity, bubble gum flavors.</li>
    <li> these are awesome. purchased the tooth polishing thingy here, and it died after about 5 mins... but THIS STUFF is awesome and the taste is pretty good.</li>
    <li> This polish helps keep my teeth looking their best between cleanings.  The flavors are tasty too.</li>
    <li> Small... Hard... taste is ok. For the price it&#x27;s all good, but the size is SO small. I wish I could get the one just a bit softer than this. It DOES say &amp;#34;Firmer splatter-free formula for less mess in your bathroom&amp;#34;.... so, yeah.</li>
    <li> I love the flavors. It works. It might work better if it were not so dry. Keeping it in the tip is a bit tricky.</li>
    <li> This was awesome. I got the same &amp;#34;just cleaned&amp;#34; feeling like after you get from the dentist. I used these with my Sonicare toothbrush and I got perfect results. Apparently you can get the same result from using baking soda and mixing it with water, but I prefer this prophy paste to anything.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Removed The Stains From My teeth. I was very surprised how well it worked for me. I&#x27;m a smoker.</li>
    <li> They arrived quickly thanks to Amazon Prime but the first 4 cups I opened were completely dry and hard. The 5th cup was a little softer but still not useable. I gave up after 5 cups and will be returning them for a refund.</li>
    <li> It seems ok. I use it with a sonic brush but I am worried that it might be taking off the enamel layer of my teeth.</li>
    <li> This is the same exact polish used by the dentist&#x27;s office.  Same outstanding results in the comfort of your own bathroom.</li>
    <li> Works great in removing stains</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to keep the stain off</li>
    <li> light/med grit came with a variety of flavors very nice</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on an antibiotic that makes coffee, tea, and those nasty cigarettes stain my teeth horribly. This product is great for helping to reduce the stains between dental appointments. I tried using with a tooth polisher, but it&#x27;s design made it hard to get backs of teeth. I use it with my oral B rotating toothbrush and can reach those areas.</li>
    <li> This brand is just okay. It&#x27;s dried out and hard to use. Think maybe too old? It stains your fingers.</li>
    <li> I was worried by some of the negative reviews about the polish being hard and unusable. What I received was the opposite. The paste was fresh and very pliable. No problem loading the polishing tip on my battery operated polisher - just dipped the tip into the polish cup and voile.  Yes, the quantities are a bit small, but there is plenty of polish in each cup to last for many cleanings.</li>
    <li> Will order a gain, works for me!!</li>
    <li> I like that this product is available but I wish there were more flavors available and that it was easier to remove from the container</li>
    <li> Took off coffee stains after one use. Wouldn&#x27;t use them more than once a month, however. Probably removes enamel as well if over used.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t notice much of a difference</li>
    <li> Product seems to be the same as what dentists use.  Note to just find a polisher that works properly.</li>
    <li> Just the best on the web!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> crap was all dried up do not buy waste of money</li>
    <li> Great product! Cleans well.</li>
    <li> Love My Shiny White Teeth!</li>
    <li> Works well to remove stains.  Easy to use.  Tastes good.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and was as described.</li>
    <li> all dried up, useless</li>
    <li> tooth polish did not remove stains from your teeth.</li>
    <li> I used this with a little battery powered tooth polisher I purchased off  of Amazon and it works great.  Immediately removes wine, coffee, and tea stains.</li>
    <li> Every one of them was so dry and cracked it as unuseable.</li>
    <li> Year ago I used a product that you could buy at any drugstore.  It is available on Amazon, but since made in the UK, it is very hard to find.  I found these and ordered them.  They are nice to use every now and again to buff your teeth. It is just like they use at the dentist.  Some of the flavors would be great for children, though I would not enjoy them.  For the price and since I don&#x27;t use this often, I am very happy with the product and my choice.  Just a quick buff between dentist appointments.</li>
    <li> Did ok but nothing special.</li>
    <li> For me these were very hard to use.  Not sure if its me or the product.  Whatever the season I ended up tossing them out.</li>
    <li> this product is really good and value of money. you will find the difference after first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i found the difference after first use. better to use this product with electric bursh</li>
    <li> I am excited to use them, but just so you know before you pay almost $13 for these tooth polishers.  They are so tiny I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I thought based on the picture they would be the size of maybe like a paint color for an artist, but they are seriously no bigger than an eraser on a #2 pencil.  I will let you know more when I try them out.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this item..  Mine arrived in a small plastic bag but each container had dried up tooth paste.</li>
    <li> Just like what the Dentist uses! Whitens normal surface stains, but not deep under the enamel stains.  Great deal!  Works perfectly for me!</li>
    <li> Since I started using the polish it has helped to whiten my teeth, good stuff :-)</li>
    <li> WOW- GETS YOUR TEETH CLEAN!!!</li>
    <li> I think these are great to use from time to time to get that fresh from the dentist feeling. Smiles all around!</li>
    <li> This product was dried out. It was next to impossible to get product into my polisher head. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Flavors were fine, a few of these were really dried out but still able to use by putting water in to soften.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the stuff they use at the dentist.  Depends on which vendor you use as to which flavors you get.  I got mostly the orange and brown ones.  I don&#x27;t mind, it&#x27;s not like you use this stuff for the taste and they are all good enough.</li>
    <li> Using this with my Braun electric toothbrush I was able to remove some of what I missed with the excellent &amp;#34;Dental Tartar Scraper and Remover Set, SS&amp;#34;.  Perhaps a hygienist could comment on how wise this is, as it could be too aggressive.</li>
    <li> i love this product...it worked great. i used it with a sonic brush, and i was impressed abt the result i got from using it. i didnt want to use my sonic brush at first bc i didnt want to ruin the head, i used a regular brush and the result wasnt good and i tried it with my sonic brush, then i saw the result right away...for the ppl saying it doesnt work....i guess u just need to get a electronic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is the first time we have tried this product. No instruction as to proper use. Contents in tiny container are hard and difficult to get product out on the cleaning brush. So far, not much success using this product. Delivered on time as promised.</li>
    <li> Kind of a little hard to remove from package but seems to work well with an electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I just received an old batch but I am very disappointed in this product. You literally have to get a sharp instrument to dig the polish out of the container and once you put it your electric toothbrush it slings all over the place. If it were a little more soft or more pliant, it would work just like the polish used by the dentist.</li>
    <li> I had two stained teeth and this product with a polisher and cleared it away. Easy, fast and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> excellent customer service great product thank you</li>
    <li> I liked the product but the paste was a bit hard and didn&#x27;t spread on my teeth. I was expecting it to be somewhat like toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Polish worked great, comes with no instructions so trial and error.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipment!  Highly recommended!  A+++!</li>
    <li> The LED LIGHT ON THESE TOOLS ARE AMAZING .</li>
