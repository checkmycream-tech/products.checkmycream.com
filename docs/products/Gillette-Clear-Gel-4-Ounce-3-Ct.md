<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t always enjoyed using gel deodorant, but so far, my experience with this gillette clear gel cool wave has been a positive one. I use the product in the morning, and so far it has lasted through the day for sure. I&#x27;m not sure about 48 hours as I&#x27;ve re-applied every 24, but it does it&#x27;s job well. 4 stars is just because it takes the gel some time to dry. This deodorant helps you gauge the right amount to apply though, so that you don&#x27;t overuse it. I received this deodorant for free to test, but my experiences and words here are my own!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really used to the clear gel at first but I got used to it pretty quick. The smell isn&#x27;t the best, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all. Since it lasts a long time it is definitely worth the money. I did test Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all of my opinions are my own. So if you are looking for a good deodorant this should be one you should try out</li>
    <li> This deodorant not only goes on smooth and dries quickly but it smells great!!!! I am definitely buying it next time I need deodorant for sure, also I noticed they have coupons for Gillette Endurance on line which makes it a great buy, I ordered a few of the 3 packs for stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually go for gel deodorants but I like this one. The applicator is pretty worthless, you can click it five times and get almost nothing out sometimes. The deodorant itself is great, and I mean great. It smells awesome and keeps smelling awesome all day. It keeps you pretty dry too. I tested this product for free but that&#x27;s my personal opinion of it.</li>
    <li> So I usually use Dove Men+Care and it works well but left white residue and I never liked that. Then, after I started using Every Man Jack body soap, I tried their deodorant. It was nice, but it wouldn&#x27;t last the whole day and my job is pretty sedentary so failing deodorant is a no-no because people look at you like, &amp;#34;You&#x27;re hunched over a computer all day. Why are you funky right now?&amp;#34;. So I tried Gillette Clear Gel Cool Wave as a part of a free test and it found that it works well. In fact, I knew I&#x27;d be pretty lazy over the Thanksgiving holiday (catching up on movies at home) so I decided to experiment with the 48-hour protection that the product promised. I took a shower Thursday morning and held off until Friday evening to take another shower. My underarms remained dry and not ripe. Also, there were no underarm chalklines. Trust me, my spouse would have let me know if something was off. I also noticed that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of the product for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now one thing I will say about the gel is that it doesn&#x27;t come out of the container at an even level, so the temptation is to keep twisting the bottom knob until you see more come out. No need for that. Just one or two twists to the right should suffice in giving you enough gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned before, I was given the Gillette Clear Gel product free to test, but my testing opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received a sampler of Gillette Clear Gel for free, but my opinion and review here is my own. I can say I was surprised after using it as I&#x27;ve never been a fan of gel deodorants. They have never worked for me in the past. Then I tried this one and It worked very well, actually! Normally I use a deodorant stick that leaves residue in my shirts. Not the case with this particular gel deodorant. I can say that I have finally found a gel deodorant that I actually like and will use. As a abnormally sweaty person, I was pleasantly surprised that my pits were dry after using it. If you were not a fan of gel deodorants before, at least give this one a try for yourself. You might be surprised as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other top brand clear gels before and have been burned. Even if they worked they would damage many of my shirts by bleaching the under arm area. I have not had any problems of that nature with Gillette. It keeps both me and my clothes looking and smelling fresh. I have not pushed it to 48 hours but it handles 24 hours without a sweat.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not to bad. Getting used to a gel verses a solid. But I like how long it lasts and smells really good throughout the day.</li>
    <li> works and smells great! I&#x27;m not too sure whats different from the previous gillette gel&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried, but this one works great. Before I had issues with the gel only lasting a few hours and almost being non-existent after doing any type of strenuous activity. Def a great buy!</li>
    <li> I was always a little skeptical about &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; Deodorant, but I think that is because when I used them in High School they would only last two weeks because I would put on a million clicks at a time! This Gillette is awesome, though! (Only a click or two a day needed!) I had used another brand that was similar but it made my armpits itch.  This keeps me dry and fresh, and since I am chasing around two kids under four all day, that says a lot!  Check it out! I  tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have tried a clear gel before and didn&#x27;t like it at all.  After trying Gillette, I have found my new deodrant.  I was pleasantly surprised that it worked as described with a fresh scent that was not overbearing.  It dries pretty quick and you stay dry all day/night long.  I even did some exercising and worked outside on the weekend and not once did my underarms smell or get sweaty.  I like that it is clear so no deodorant lines on my shirts.  The only con that I have seen is I don&#x27;t particularly like the design of the casing.  As you put it on, it gets over the sides a little lower then where the lid closes and can get messy.  The twister also will take a little time to get used to as sometimes none comes out and other times it comes out a little more.  Other then that, it is a great product and will be using it from now on.  Great job Gillette!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Gillette Clear Gel for Free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> so attempting to switch things up and see if this would be a good match for me, i was slightly let down, I&#x27;ve never used a clear deodorant before and with the extended protection from this deodorant I figured it would be a great fit for me, upon using it for a week I found out that it was not a great fit for my daily use. It stayed wet longer than anticipated which made me uncomfortable until  it dried with was later than sooner. I did test this for free, and this is my personal opinion on the product, im sure others may either disagree or agree with me, but these are my feeling on the product!</li>
    <li> i luv this deordorant the design and packaging is futuristically cool. the gel glides on easily..the twist part is a little stiff but this product preforms under pressure..and much better than other antiperspants.. #nosweat</li>
    <li> I typically use Degree speed stick and have never liked gel deodorants very much.  However, I had the opportunity to test this product so I tried it out for a few weeks.  I don&#x27;t really like gels because I don&#x27;t like the cold wet feeling I get when I apply it. I still felt that same discomfort when I applied this product but it does dry pretty quickly. What I liked about it: the fact that it keeps you fresh for 48 hours. I did test this and found it to be true. Usually I start to have b.o if I miss just one day of applying my regular deodorant but I really did stay fresh for 48 hours with this product.  I also liked that I didn&#x27;t get the white streaks on my shirts that I sometimes get with my deodorant stick.&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like: the cold wet feeling when I first apply it. For some reason when I take the top off in the morning some of the gel has already come up from the openings and so I can&#x27;t always control how much I put on.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I liked it for a gel deodorant but still prefer my stick.&lt;br /&gt;* I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this deodorant. I felt wet under my arms all day. It never seemed to dry and left me feeling gross and my underarms wet on my shirt. It did smell good. I got this deodorant free from Influenster for review. This is my honest feedback.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I received this stick of Gillette clear cool wave gel deodrant product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34; I really enjoyed this product considering it was a gel deodrant. I sweat alot and to my surprise I stayed dry and feeling cool. I would reccomend this product to my family and friends. ‪#‎NOSWEAT‬, ‪#‎GCG‬, ‪#‎GilletteTester‬ Influenster</li>
    <li> Firstly, this stuff smells PHENOMENAL. I mean, this stuff is delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In action: As a Division 1 athlete, I need a deodorant that works hard and long. Gillette Endurance does exactly that. Even after a two-hour workout, this stuff was still kickin&#x27; for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing that I have to say about this is the gel format. I&#x27;m just not a huge fan of the gel as I always seem to get the gel everywhere but where I want it to go. Saying that, I highly recommend this for you active folk out there.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works amazingly well. It keeps my armpits dry and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. I&#x27;ve also noticed that it The fragrance lasts a lot longer than most other deodorants I&#x27;ve used. I work out a lot and even after sweating at the gym for a couple hours I somehow magically still smell good. I would definitely recommend buying this Gillette clear gel deodorant… Especially if you suffer from stinky armpit disease.</li>
    <li> I received the product free for testing purposes but all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the clear gel anti-perspirant! It does a great job at keeping me dry even at the end of the day i find it is still going strong at keeping me dry and protected! I&#x27;ve previously used Axe and find that that this works a lot better and the great smell lasts so much longer! This is definitely going to replace my previous anti-perspirant from now on!</li>
    <li> Gillette has worked great for me at work. It cools as well as keeps me fresh. The scent is great and last throughout my entire shift. #NOSWEAT #GCG #contest @influenster @gillette</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette clear gel for  a couple days now and while it works well, the thing I learned right away was don&#x27;t apply too much. Applying to much makes the underarms feel kind of wet and not a good feeling, but overall I&#x27;m happy with the product. I got to test this product for free but the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> What a great product this is! I was given a free sample to try and loved this deodorant. I have always been an Old Spice guy, but this stuff works great. Rolls on clear, feels soothing, smells great and leaves me feeling fresh for the entire day. It&#x27;s also better than other gels because of the clear application, it doesn&#x27;t mark up clothing or cause strange colored residue. I would recommend this to anyone wishing to give a new clear gel a try for underarm and sweat protection.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to test this product through Influenster, and I have absolutely loved using this product every day. I always loved Old Spice, but I would sweat profusely and it would wear off. Not the Gillette Clear Gel, though. It provides protection throughout the day, and I smell just as good when I get home from work as I did when I left in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I got a stick of this deodorant from Influenster, and it is AMAZING! My wife loves the smell on me, it keeps me from sweating all over everything, and it looks really cool and clear. Definitely dry and no weird crap on my skin!</li>
    <li> I am greatly impressed with this product. This is the first time I used a Gillette deodorant and am greatly satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Has a great smell that resembles a refreshing cologne smell&lt;br /&gt;- Only a small amount of products needs to be applied and lasts for hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Deodorant states only need to twist dial twice but is very inconsistent in amount of gel that is released&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: It is a great product and would gladly switch to this line for future use</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of different types of deodorant that irritated my skin and made me itchy, or didn&#x27;t offer me the right protection. The gel needs to dry before you put on a shirt, but that is the only negative thing I have to say. It smells great, and most of all doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It also gets me through a long work day.</li>
    <li> This is a great deodorant. The scent is great (not overwhelming, yet it doesn&#x27;t disappear), and it lasted all day.  I am a regular Old Spice user, but after trying this product I am likely switching to Gillette Clear Gel.&lt;br /&gt;I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have always used Degree, but was given a chance to review this deodorant from Gillette, Although the scent Cool Wave is okay, definitely not my favorite, although it did do a good job keeping me dry while I ran around this morning doing errands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this for free to review from Gillette, but my opinion is my own.  I might get this again if it was on sale, or had a coupon for it.  Not sure if I am going to switch brands quite yet though.</li>
    <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes at all. seems to work as a deoderant but i don&#x27;t care for the wet feeling under my arms from it. not just when i put it on but hours later it&#x27;s still wet. I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> I recieved this through influenster. I used it once and was not a big fan. I don&#x27;t like gel deodorant. I am more of an old spice guy.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is very good. It keeps me dry and feeling fresh throughout the day. It is not a solid deodorant but a liquid based gel. I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> One of the best deodorants I have used. It keeps me cool and dry all day</li>
    <li> Full disclosure I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own. I was pleasantly surprised with this product. It&#x27;s a gel, so if that&#x27;s not something you&#x27;re used to, you&#x27;ll probably be a little surprised with the inconsistency of the application. But, it has a pretty good scent and lasts for a while. Overall, it&#x27;s a solid deodorant, just not good enough to get me to switch.</li>
    <li> I tested this through Influenster. I like the deodorant itself. Its not super strong smelling. Clear means no stains or funny white powder. It goes on smooth enough and seems to last quite awhile. I&#x27;m not sure I like the little dial on the bottom. It could be a big bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get it in the mail in the winter don&#x27;t try it right away like I did. Man that was cold..lol. All kidding aside I like it</li>
    <li> works great, but the scent is way too strong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 48 hour version of an anti-perspirant. I had doubts, but Gillette has figured out correct mix and it absolutely worked for me. My two issues are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. the applicator was either broken or weak in design... the &amp;#34;wheel&amp;#34; spins but the gel never rose until I gently squeezed the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. the scent. it&#x27;s pleasant, but it smells like it&#x27;s trying to smell like deodorant. I prefer more subdued earthy scents, vanilla, coffee, chocolate... this smells like soap cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to try the product, and I tested it for free via influenster. I&#x27;d try it again as my go to if they create a scent that I like.</li>
    <li> Upon first opening this product, I knew I was in for a learning experience, as I currently used a solid white deodorant on a daily basis. It was definitely a weird feeling applying this product for the first time. The unusual feeling of a cold gel under my arms took some getting used to, but it really did smell clean and refreshing, and the absence of chalky-white residue especially on dark clothes was an added plus when using this stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as performance goes this deodorant does not disappoint. I applied some once a day in the morning usually, unless, I had a night outing where I would apply again, and it kept me dry and fresh for over 12 hours on most days.&lt;br /&gt;About the only thing one really needs to keep in mind is just how much to apply. One can easily add too much or too little since the gel is regulated by a dial at the bottom of the stick. After a couple of uses, you get a feel of just the right amount to turn the dial at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I enjoyed using this product, and I believe I will continue to use it, as I really hate the residue that solids leave on clothes. And, as a bonus I really like the fragrance contained in this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note: I received this product free of charge, however these are my own opinions after testing it.</li>
    <li> At first I was a little skeptical because I usually don&#x27;t use a gel deodorant, but I was pleasantly surprised.  There were no weird marks and after I applied it, I literally forgot about it, which I suppose is the point.  For me, I love the 48 hour protection because my days can be very long .  The product kept me fresh and feeling clean.  I had the opportunity to try out a sample of the product for free, but in my opinion it was good enough that I&#x27;d purchase for myself in the future.</li>
    <li> This is the first clear gel deodorant I&#x27;ve tried. It dries almost immediately when applied and lasts all day without having to reapply. I have a very physical job and it works all day long. I will definitely continue to use this product! I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Gillette Clear Gel Cool Wave Anti-Perspirant is an amazing product. I apply it in the morning and keeps me dry all day. Best part is that it goes on clear, no more weird stains! Received it as a free promotion, but all opinions are mine.</li>
    <li> I usually use regular stick deodorant Ive tried several brands and i have not had success with several well know deodorant brands.  I was lucky enough to try Gillette Clear gel cool wave for free and this review is all my own opnion. First off, I really like the scent of it and it doesn&#x27;t clash with my colognes. by the end of the day Im not smelly as i usually would be so i am very pleased it has great odor protection. and most stick deodorants  cause weird caking in my arm pits, but this Gillette Gell does not which I love!!  This will be my new goto deodorant!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Goes on smooth and gives a cooling sensation. I work outside and wear multiple layers of clothing so I sweat a lot if the weather changes. This kept me dry and smelling good all day long.</li>
    <li> I am usually a stickler when it comes to change with my deoderant. I usually use Old Spice Clear Stick and absolutely refuse any white stick due to white streaking and clumping. I was given this as a free sample and this stuff is great. My shirts don&#x27;t stink after a day of wearing them and I only have to apply it once a day. The initial cold splat of goo under your armpit is a little awkward compared to a clear stick, but I came around quickly. It seems better if you don&#x27;t turn the knob everytime you use it, but rather squeeze the casing more often than not to get what you need. If you don&#x27;t, then any kind of pressure (in a suitcase or gym bag) will make it clump in the cap. Overall 4/5 stars. Good going Gilette. It&#x27;s cheaper than Old Spice too!!</li>
    <li> I got this item free through influenster.  I never use gel deodorant so I was not used to the slime like feel of it.  To me I would prefer a stick or roll on.  That aside this stuff works great and has the smell of cologne.  If you like gel deodorant then you will love this stuff. So the reason for the 3 stars for me is that I just do not like the feel of the gel after applying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never enjoyed using gel deodorant because I can never get the gel to consistently come out of the container and typically the gel doesn&#x27;t dry quickly on my armpits. This product dries quicker than others I&#x27;ve tried, but still doesn&#x27;t push out the gel until I&#x27;ve spin the container 6-7 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed that the odor protection rarely lasts a full day and I find myself reapplying either this product or a different anti perspirant before working out in the evening to avoid the funky arm pit smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have now used Gillette Clear Gel now for 15 days and I have not had any problem with any body odor. I tried to push the limits and I went 2 days with out applying it and I still had no problem with body odor. It is refreshing on my underarms. You will only need to turn the knob 2 times. The gel goes a long way under your arms. I was able to test Gillette Clear Gel for free.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like the Gillette Clear Gel Cool Wave - that I got free to try from Influenster - as I tend to stick with my ol&#x27; faithful Old Spice deodorants.    I nervously gave this a shot and was more than pleasantly surprised by how well it has worked.    We went through a stretch at work where it was 79º in the office (heaters were turned higher than they should have been) and if I moved away from the fan at my desk I&#x27;d start sweating... everywhere but under my arms. At one point I was even thinking about rubbing the gel on my forehead to see if it&#x27;d stop me from sweating there too, but thankfully they&#x27;ve fixed the heat problems.    The first couple of times I used it were a little tricky because I pushed out way too much gel than I needed, so it took a few minutes for my armpits to dry out. But once they did, the Cool Wave did its job and prevented me from having leaky pits. There&#x27;s actually a guy at work that I&#x27;m thinking about buying some of this for because he&#x27;s always getting the pit stains just from sitting at his desk... even before the heater problems. &gt;_&lt;    Being as hot natured as I am, I appreciate how this stuff goes on cool in the mornings. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m rubbing my pits with a can of beer from the fridge... not that I&#x27;ve ever done that, but you get the idea.    I also like how it doesn&#x27;t make it look like I&#x27;ve got armpit dandruff when I take off my shirt. That&#x27;s most definitely a plus.    Anyway, this stuff works...  Seriously.    I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> I have no glaring complaints: the deodorant works fine and smells nice.  Personally, I am just not a fan of clear gel deodorant.  I am regularly a user of stick-style deodorant and feel much more comfortable when applying to my underarms.  I often feel the clear gel is wet and sticky.  Just not for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this deodorant for free, but the above opinion is certainly my own.</li>
    <li> Its nice and wet. keeps me smelling good for 2 days. i sweat a lot and this really helps. i enjoy the smell as well.</li>
    <li> Was able to test the Gillette Clear Gel Cool Wave, but all opinions are your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a very sweaty person which requires to use deodorant a lot, mainly use clinical but now with the new clear gel it last most on the day with 1 application in the morning. Has a great smell and feels fresh everyday when using. The only poor thing would be applicator when pressed too hard a lot of gel would come out. But that never stopped me since used the extra that came out and apply on my self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Gillette Clear Gel Cool Wave is your standard anti-perspirant/deodorant. It does a decent job of keeping you dry and the smell is great. In my case, standard anti-perspirant&#x27;s do not do enough - so much so that I have only found one product (Odaban) that keeps me completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the typical user, I believe this would be exactly what they would need, however in my case, I need to use this product as a complement to a prescription level anti-perspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I did like the fact that the product is a clear gel, with no residue, and it smells very good.&lt;br /&gt;The main drawbacks, in my opinion, is the applicator, which can distribute too much of the product per twist, along with the cap which can suction unneeded product out when just opening the deodorant on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I did test this product for free, however my opinions and comments are entirely my own.</li>
    <li> I was able to recieve a complimentary stick of the Gillette Clear Gel Cool Wave and I had not previously used a gel deodorant. It took a few times to get used to the feeling of the gel after application but once that feeling wears off the product works well.  I do not know if I would personally buy this product but if you like gel deodorant then you won&#x27;t find a better one on the market.</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant now it doesn&#x27;t wear off as easily as other deodorants I&#x27;ve tried in the past and the smell isn&#x27;t to over powering. The only problem is that when it dries it does leave a white mark on my shirt on the inside but because it&#x27;s on the inside it doesn&#x27;t really matter no ones gonna see it . I got it from influencer to review but all my opinions are mine</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this a lot as I have been a long time user (6+years) of a competitors product. I did a 30 day trial of the Clear Gel Cool Wave Anti-Perspirant to see how it compared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy to use&lt;br /&gt;the scent was very good&lt;br /&gt;very long lasting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;had to use more than the 2 &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;kept getting stuck while applying&lt;br /&gt;did not last as long as my normal stick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did give it a 3 out of 5 stars as I did like the scent and the anti-perspirant lasted a very long time. The stick did not last as long as my normal and I had to use more than the recommended amount of 2 &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; which might have been why I used more than my normal amount. I would probably try it again, but who can say for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a stick of Gillette Clear Gel for free, to compare it to my normal anti-perspirant stick, but all comments and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Although this is a great product, it just may not be the best product for me. Smells great, and feels good going on. My only problem is that I feel like it doesn&#x27;t last the entire day for me, leaving me a little smelly. I&#x27;m primarily a solid stick user. But if you like gel deodorants, this is the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I tested this for free, but these opinions are my own.)</li>
    <li> This product does all it promises! Used it before I did some holiday shopping and it worked great. Applied once in the morning and even with all the running around and decorative lights, it kept me cool and dry all afternoon! I&#x27;ve never used antiperspirant, but I think I will from now on. Recommend to anyone! I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using Gillette Clear Gel Deodorant. I have always used dry stick deodorant. My first impression was of the dispenser. it wasn&#x27;t as easy to use as others I have had in the past. Turning the dial the exact same amount would dispense various amounts of the product. So, after working with it for a bit, I finally got the amount right and applied it. The wet feeling when applying was strange to me at first, but it quickly dried.    I have used it for several days now and am very happy with the performance. I stayed dry throughout the day (I perspire quite a bit) and had no odor.    After the initial reaction when trying to dispense, I have no complaints about the product. It works well.    I tested this product for free, but the opinions are my own</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re sick of the white deodorant marks on your clothes from the regular sticks this gel works great. I haven&#x27;t seen any deodorant stains on my shirts since I started using it and it actually works great as an antiperspirant. Smells great too and I&#x27;d definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Having been a Degree antiperspirant (powder) user, Gillette Clear Gel seemed like a risk. At first. Getting the product to dispense initially was a chore, several twists rewarded with a ridiculous amount of gel... After roughly two weeks of use, I&#x27;ve found it easier to squeeze the container until a fair amount pops out of the top.    As for performance, I love it! It dries within minutes and doesn&#x27;t leave stains on my work shirts. I&#x27;m in retail, and although it&#x27;s winter, I still manage to get what feels like a sweat going, except my underarms are clear. Which is great as I go from working on the floor to inside a cooler or freezer, and then interact with fellow associates or customers. If more than 18 hours pass from application of the gel, I find it still working, even without reapplication. The \\&quot;48 Hours of freshness\\&quot; is no gimmick, this stuff works. This product was a free test, and all opinions are strictly my own.</li>
    <li> I tested this product over the last month and I must say is is possibly the least effective deodorant and antiperspirant that I have ever used. I would not recommend this to anyone. The product once applied fails to keep me dry at anytime. So I stopped using it after the second day of having it. Im glad I did not pay for this. #NOSWEAT  is not accurate at all!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this A-P for a LONG time lately pretty hard to come by it works and I love it and I perspire a LOT . I hope they are not phasing it  out.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Keeps me smelling good for over 24 hours. Also, doesn&#x27;t bug my allergies like most scented deodorant. I always get compliments on how good I smell, thanks to this, and some good laundry products (and maybe my awesome musk? Sure, why not?).</li>
    <li> Most of my other deodorants are not Gel based, but after giving this one a shot I must say it works very well. Going throughout the day and after an indoor soccer game it kept me surprisingly sweat free unlike some of my other brands of deodorants. Definitely worth the purchase if you haven&#x27;t tried a clear gel deodorant before or are looking for something new! The cool-wave sent is also very refreshing. My only complaint was with the application, it tends to be over generous with the amount that comes out, but usually the two twist method ends up being okay. After a few days of getting used to it you work out how much works for you and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free, but all opinions are my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.Great sent.&lt;br /&gt;2.Works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.Messy applicator</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and I have sensitive underarm skin not once have i had to worry about sweat! I put it on and I am confident it will last me all day sometimes even longer!  I would HIGHLY recommend this deodorant to everyone. I have tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d have to agree with many of the other folks on here. I think the deodorant itself works pretty well, but the packaging doesn&#x27;t seem to do what it&#x27;s designed to do. For the first few uses, it squeezed it out (seemingly) normally, but afterwards, it took some serious effort to use it. Of course it&#x27;s possible that I simply received a bad stick, but that&#x27;s the one I&#x27;m basing my opinions off of. But hey, it smells good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this seems like a solid product for what it&#x27;s worth. I got my money&#x27;s worth (I received this for free), but my opinion is my own.</li>
    <li> Most of my other deodorants are not Gel based, but after giving this one a shot I must say it works very well. Going throughout the day and after an football game it kept me surprisingly sweat free unlike some of my other brands of deodorants. Definitely worth the purchase if you haven&#x27;t tried a clear gel deodorant before or are looking for something new! The cool-wave sent is also very refreshing. My only complaint was with the application, it tends to be over generous with the amount that comes out, but usually the two twist method ends up being okay. After a few days of getting used to it you work out how much works for you and it works great.</li>
    <li> Not a fan at all.  This product is way too runny and makes me feel wet off the bat!  It lacks in scent and antiperspirant properties.  The packaging is too narrow not rigid enough.  If you put any pressure on it or knock it over the product spills out easily.  Sticking with old spice.</li>
    <li> I have to start by saying that I was a little skeptical at trying this new deodorant since in the past i&#x27;ve broken out in a serious rash from gel deodorants.  Not only did I not have any allergic reactions to Gillettes deodrant, but i&#x27;m never going back to my solid stick from old spice.  Unlike my old deodorant it washes out completely in the shower and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  The scent lasts all day.  Just make sure you don&#x27;t apply too much or it feels strange till it dries.  I had the luck of getting a free trial since i normally would not have risked paying for a gel deodorant due to past experiences, but now i&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, it glides on cool, smooth, and clear.I work freight, unloading trucks eight hours a day and I&#x27;m usually very sweaty around halfway through, but with this I was dry and cool all night. This will be my go to deoderant.&lt;br /&gt;I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Usually using non gel deodorant this really changed my opinion on the product. Love how the gel is clear and easy to get used to. Keeps me sweat free throughout the day, even when going to the gym. Also has a great smell and easy to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> I used to use old spice deodorant but after I received a free sample of Gillette clear gel cool wave I&#x27;ve decided to switch, it lasts longer and the night I used it I received some complements on how it smells and it lasted for two days!  Even though I got it for free,I&#x27;m thinking of buying a few packs!</li>
    <li> Good Stuff.  Been using a solid for a really long time.  The gel always got messy on me but this stuff dries quickly and works awesome.  Especially during a gym work out or running!</li>
    <li> Not a fan of gel deodorants but this one has a great smell and keeps me from having to worry about my underarms towards the end of the day. I put it on in the morning and still smell good way into the afternoon. The only problem I have with it is the feeling of the gel. It is a universal problem to gel deodorants, not specifically this one. I did receive this product complimentary to test/review but these opinions are all my own.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant about 2 weeks ago and so far it has been the best deodorant I have tried yet. I work in all types of environments mainly hot places indoors and this deodorant has kept me sweat free and smelling great! Finally I found a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts and works allday! I had received this product for free from Gillette for testing purposes and fell in love with the product.</li>
    <li> This product work great for me. I work on cars so I&#x27;m always  moving my arms and what not. Other deodorants would  leave sweat marks but this one does not. I use it when I went out and was hoping  not to get a sweat mark and it susure didn&#x27;t  give me one. I like it. I was able to try this for free as trial from influenster.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant ever - have been using it for a decade by now!</li>
    <li> The scent is great and the product kept me dry well into the next day. Even the next day, I was still noticeably fresh - people even commented. After a few days&#x27; use, though, my skin became dry and itchy. I&#x27;ve had this issue with other deodorant products in the past. Additionally, I had trouble getting an appropriate amount of product on the applicator grid. Turning the dial slowly, the gel didn&#x27;t come up right away and then once I&#x27;d turned enough to get a little product out, it continued oozing out of the stick. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some combination of proper usage + optimal environmental conditions to alleviate this behavior, but it was an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good Scent&lt;br /&gt;Long Lasting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Dried out my skin&lt;br /&gt;Difficulty dispensing the proper amount of product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of this product for test/review, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have been using Axe deodorant for a few years now, but my wife did not like the scent of the Axe and I did not like the white marks being left on my dark tee shirts so when Gillette offered to send me the Cool Wave Anti-Perspirant to test I was glad that it was one, clear and two, did not have a strong smell. I was sceptical about the 48 hour claim, as someone who travels a lot and is on the road the idea of a longer lasting Deodorant is appealing. After nearly two weeks of use I have to say I am a believer, the deodorant and myself don&#x27;t smell even 48 hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I did receive the deodorant for free to test, my opinions are my own, and if it would have not worked I would have reviewed it as such.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for testing purposes from Influenster, but these are my own opinions. After using this for over a week I really found I liked it over the traditional deodorants. I had been using both old spice but I now prefer this due to the smell and long lasting effect. I also like the fact that it dries clear and doesn&#x27;t flake off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great smell&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Wet feeling after</li>
    <li> It smells good and that makes me smell good. I prefer clear gel and, well, that&#x27;s what this is. My wife likes the smell of it and, hence, she also likes the smell of me. The applicator worked fine for me. It&#x27;s your typical twist and apply sort of thing and it didn&#x27;t squelch out all over the place like I have had some do in the past from other brands. It&#x27;s good. If you like fresh scents and clear gel you can&#x27;t go wrong. Oh, and I, too, got a sample of this stuff for free and these opinions are entirely my own.</li>
    <li> Works great. Kept me fresh all day. Only problem was being careful when I took the cap off to not squeeze too hard or the gel starts overflowing.    I tested Gillette for free but opinion is my own.</li>
    <li> I have never liked gel deodorant/anti-persperant and this product reminded me why.  It feels sticky, doesn&#x27;t last, and left me feeling stinky.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this deodorant through the Gillette voxbox by Influenster with the #NOSWEAT campaign. I feel that it would work much better for people who don&#x27;t overly perspire. For me, I was sweating after an hour or two, but for the first hours, it was well scented and didn&#x27;t give off a bad smell. It also kept me non-sweaty. I would say that it didn&#x27;t help that I am in a place with very humid heat. This is perfect for someone who likes to be on the go, but has a moderate sweat pattern.</li>
    <li> Im not a big fan of gel deordaeant but this one i gave a chance and seemed a little more faster when drying and kept me smelling great throughout the day ever after the gym. I personally would rather use dry the wet but this is something i may consider next time.</li>
    <li> I was yet to try clear gel deodorant,  I really liked the way it lasted compared to the usal deodorant I use. It doesn&#x27;t leave the white marks on my colored shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe villarreal</li>
    <li> #NoSweat After working 12 hours a day in construction. This is a great long lasting deodorant / anti-perspirant. It delivered a fine smell and a clean feel of dryness all day long.</li>
    <li> I recently received this via influenster, and I find it to be ok. I don&#x27;t think I would buy it for myself. For one, I normally use deodorant and not antiperspirant because I don&#x27;t really sweat all that much. I don&#x27;t like how this product and other antiperspirants leave me with a weird &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; on my underarms. On the other hand, this product does smell very good and I feel sexy wearing it.</li>
    <li> Gillette Clear Gel has been an awesome addition to my grooming routine. I appreciate not having white muck on my clothes (that has ruined shirts in the past), and it seems to last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received Gellette Gel for free, but this opinion is entirely my own)</li>
    <li> I receivded this product completely free for testing purposes my review is 100% my own. I love this deodorant, no stains on my shirt great protection quick drying,smells good,only need a little,not sticky.I am a creature of habit. Once I find something that works... I stick with it.The consistency makes me feel like it has &amp;#34;substance&amp;#34; and can actually do what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I don&#x27;t worry about underarm odor ever when I have it on.Won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette clear gel antiperspirant for years and I think it&#x27;s the best. It isn&#x27;t messy and it works great. It lasts all day and smells good. No messy residue. I received Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I normally use Old Spice powder antiperspirant/deodorant stick.  I didn&#x27;t like gel in the past because it felt too gooey and didn&#x27;t dry well for me.  However, after testing this product out for free, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that I will be switching my deodorant choice to this one.  I&#x27;m a rugby player, and I sweat a LOT.  This particular deodorant/antiperspirant keeps me smelling fresh and keeps me dry, which is hard when you&#x27;re active like I am.</li>
    <li> The Scent is good and it is cool. It keeps me fresh. I feel it is little bit sticky after few hours of use. But not much. Overall - GOOD.</li>
    <li> First let me say I received the product(s) complimentary to test and/or review. Now, it would be easy for me to lie and say this deodorant changed my life, but it did not. That being said, it has a great smell, and I am very picky with my deodorant because I have sensitive armpits, but this stuff feels great. It is very cooling and comfortable. After switching deodorants each and every time I&#x27;ve bought a new one for the past few years, I think I found my permanent one....</li>
    <li> Though I tested this item of free, I would strongly consider purchasing it. It&#x27;s worth it. The scent is excellent, not over powering but certainly remains fragrant for hours. I noticed a day and a half later, in the shower...(don&#x27;t ask why I didn&#x27;t shower for a day and a half) the the drying affect was still working and did so until i scrubbed with body wash. Down side is the gel is susceptible  to suction when taking cap off and pulls some product out. All and all worth a shot if you are looking for a new deodorant.</li>
    <li> I have used Gillette Clear Gel Deodorant for a couple of days now. I really like how it smells and keeps me dry (after 15 minutes). The reason why I say 15 minutes is because when you apply the deodorant it feels like your underarms are sweating, but once it dries I never had a problem. I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually a fan of gel-based deodorants (they just feel messy!), but I have to say I&#x27;m a pretty big fan of this one.  I tried it as part of a review program, and it far exceeded my expectations.  It smells good and it lasts an incredibly long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one part I wasn&#x27;t so wild about was the contained . Being a gel deodorant, if you squeeze the container while taking off the lid the gel will already have come out the top.  Perhaps I just need a more gentle grip. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I noted, while I did receive this Gillette Clear Gel for free/review, my thoughts and opinions are purely my own. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have tried clear gels in the past and never liked how they worked throughout the day. I usually purchase powdered stick deodorant. I received a free sample from Influenster in a Gillette campaign. I have to say that I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how well it works! It stay drier all day and don&#x27;t get an odor by night time either. This will definitely replace my current brand/type or deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Ive received Gillette Clear Gel Endurance to try out and I have to say im loving it. When you use a deodorant, you expect 2 things longevity of scent and no odor and if it damages your clothes like some deodorants do. After using it for few days I have felt good wearing it. I noticed no sweat scent, it stays fresh and lasts almost to the next day. Gillette Clear Gel Endurance is a really good and worth it product. Im gonna use Gillette Clear Gel Endurance from now on compared to my old deodorant. It lasts long and keeps me fresh for when I go out and gives me a higher sense of confidence, like I dont have to worry about having smelly armpits haha. Thank you Gillette Clear Gel Endurance &amp; Influenster!! #NoSweat #GcG</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan of the wet gel, but I can&#x27;t deny that the deodorant Did its job. It definitely worked for a good 12 hour shift in a 110degree kitchen and then some. Not all deodorants can handle that.&lt;br /&gt;I tried Gillette for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed this product.  I put it to the test with 36 hours straight of wearing.  After the 36 hours I still felt fresh and smelling good.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes gel deoderant!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I received it two weeks ago and I really like the different from my Old Spice powdered deodorant. I&#x27;ve literally let it go the 48 hour test on a few occasions and it has held up well, though my arm pits feel a bit dry and desolate after that period of time, it&#x27;s nothing a shower can&#x27;t fix. I rate this deodorant 4 out of 5 stars because I think the nozzle at the bottom to make the gel rise up could be improved or at least larger or even more simplified instead of twisting and pushing up from below to get the gel out but all n all its good and I may switch to Gillette for good as this gel version doesn&#x27;t leave residue.    I tested this deodorant product from influenster/Gillette for free and the below opinions are of my own.</li>
    <li> I think the effect of antiperspirant/deodorant is great. It certainly is an effective product. However, my issues come from the type of applicator it is. It&#x27;s messy. It is a gel, so the mess is understandable. I never wanted too much and the applicator would push too much up or not enough. So I would keep a tissue near by to wipe off excess gel. I also don&#x27;t think I like the gel type deodorant. It doesn&#x27;t dry very quickly, so I find myself using a hairdryer to get ti to dry by the time I put a shirt on. Overall, if you like gel, this is a good product.</li>
    <li> First off the Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy application.&lt;br /&gt;No white residue.&lt;br /&gt;Has decent lasting power for non-strenuous activity.&lt;br /&gt;There was no \\&quot;sweat\\&quot; to speak of.&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also easy to dispense too much product(they say to use two \\&quot;clicks\\&quot; but the dispenser never clicks, at all, so I went with two rotations).&lt;br /&gt;You will have that wet feeling you get from gel deodorants for a little while after application, which I personally hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ugly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On days when I was working and had more strenuous activity throughout the day(bending, lifting, walking etc.) I did notice that unfortunately the scent did not stay all the time, or at least it did not block the scent of body odor. I sweat a lot so I&#x27;m used to deodorants and anti-perspirants just not working on me sometimes but this was more a case of there was no sweat, just odor, which I found very strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this touch-and-go performance of the product I can&#x27;t recommend it fully to those who sweat a lot or do a lot of strenuous activity throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Gilette Clear Gel Cool Wave Anti-Perspirant free of charge for review purposes from the Influenster program. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks now...It works well!    I live and work in Phoenix, AZ, so it can get warm down here. Not a problem for this Gel.    My only critique of this product would be the inconsistency with which the gel is dispensed. Sometime two twists does the trick (as suggested), but often it does not, which left me twisting a few more times and ultimately using too much. Little better packaging/consistency would be helpful.    I received a free sample of this product, but all opinions are my own</li>
    <li> This is an OKAY deodorant. I just finished using up my other brand of deodorant and decided to try this. It smells good/fresh and lasts a while throughout the day. The only problem I have is that it&#x27;s messy to apply on. It&#x27;s a gel, so I mean you can&#x27;t expect it to glide on perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Gillette clear has a great smell and you get a lot for your money. The only problem I have with it is that it leaves my underarm wet.</li>
    <li> Works great, and takes care of all problems of sweat... no matter what the issue, I  tested Gillette Clear Gel for free.</li>
    <li> I had never used a clear gel deodorant before, so this definitely took some getting used to and I probably used WAY too much at first, it&#x27;s hard to tell what&#x27;s out, and how much is if you&#x27;re not used to it, but their idea of two twists is pretty spot on, but probably wrong for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I actually started using it, it was really good. I walk to and from work every day and even went for a run on my lunch break one of my days testing this, and there was no sweat at all. I really found it better than a lot of deodorants that I&#x27;ve used previously and the scent is in that right range, it&#x27;s got a nice mild sent to it, so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing too much cologne but I still smell nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great product that has converted me for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: I received this product for free, but this opinion is my own of the product after testing it)</li>
    <li> My husband tested this for me. He often usually comes home from work smelling...rather ripe and his usual deodorant masks the sweat smell with a perfumed, clumpy mess. He tried Gillette cool gel - 1 application in 48 hours - grim but all in the name of science. The smell test proved that this product keeps him dry for longer instead of trying to mask it. Of course there was still a slight odor but nothing compared to his usual brand  He said it dries relatively quickly so doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and leaves no white marks.     I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are miiiiine.</li>
    <li> I really liked the gel deodorant.  It claimed 48 hours of protection, so I gave it the ultimate test.  Thanksgiving day and Black Friday.  If it holds up those 2 days then it should be good for any 2 days. And it did hold up!  We had a hectic holiday dinner at home, hosting for the first time, and then hit up early morning shopping on black Friday.  I stayed fresh throughout the 2 days with plenty of time to spare.  I would definitely check out Gillette Clear Gel if you are looking for long-lasting deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally use gel deodorant.  I tried it out, for free, as part of a trial. The opinion I have of the product are my own and not influenced by it being free at all.</li>
    <li> I generally like Gillette products because they last a long time and leave you smelling good. This deodorant is no different. I used it when I left for the morning around 8am and it kept me smelling good until I went to bed around midnite. I didn&#x27;t get a chance to apply it just the once in 48 hours, as I always shower every day and then put on deodorant. I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but I have my own opinions about the product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to use a clear gel.</li>
    <li> A good deodorant/antiperspirant that does the job.I am NOT one that has trouble finding a deo that works for me. Despite sweating a lot, I rarely stink. This deodorant works for me. I have even gone 2 days between applications and had no problem. The gel under the armpits takes a little getting used to,and it requires 30 seconds or so to feel dry enough to put your shirt on. Still, at the end of the day I would buy it. *I received and tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> Note: I got this for free as part of a promotion, but this review is my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent...not too strong - just enough to know it&#x27;s there. And the wife likes it too, so that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a stick gel for years, so the first time I put on this clear gel I had way too much. Now that I&#x27;ve gotten the amount  correct it&#x27;s working great. I&#x27;ve noticed it working well in hours 24+, where normally I would have started to smell sweat as normal deodarant gives up, it&#x27;s just as pleasant smelling as it was the time I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I got this for free but I will certainly purchase it again in the future.</li>
    <li> Never used a gel deodorant before. It was definitely an experience!&lt;br /&gt;Be careful while using, more comes out with a twist than you think! Kind of gloppy the first day, until you get the amount right.&lt;br /&gt;It worked well. Kept dry, and smelled good... although the scent is a little strong for about the first hour, then it wears off.&lt;br /&gt;Takes longer to dry on your skin than conventional sticks, so give it time to air dry!&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, not a bad product!</li>
    <li> this is a great deodorant. i use axe alot but this holds up the any B O. and no white marks on my shirt</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for just a couple of days now.  I think the deodorant itself works fine but my issues are with the application.  I find the gels more difficult to apply if you are already wearing a shirt as they tend to get all over your clothes.  In particular with this gel, I find that even if it appears like there is very little being applied, I feel as is my underarms are soaked.  When I tried again I used just 1-2 twists and still found the same result.  So, while the product itself does a great job as an anti-perspirant and deodorant, the application leaves more to be desired.  I tested this product for free but the opinions here are my own.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette Clear Gel Cool Wave Anti-Perspirant / Deodorant for some time now and I really like it. It provides me with upto 48 hours of wetness and odor protection. The best part is that it does not leave any white stains behind like many other deodorants. It is strong enough and I do not need to reapply it during the day. Finally found a deodorant that makes me confident to keep going all day long without sweating!!&lt;br /&gt;Note: I  tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> it  goes on easy a little hard to get started but then works well. The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and it works well to keeping dry without having to reapply often. I would definitely recommend this item. I did get this item for free but this is my own opinion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Gillette Clear Gel Cool Wave Anti- Perspirant for a few days now. I was using Old Spice before and I would use it then a few hours later I would stink lol. When I found this Anti-Perspirant I was excited to give it a try, I needed something! This gel does the job keeps me smelling good for well over 24 hours that is for sure! It&#x27;s a blessing I came across this product, I am hooked. It goes on smooth and smells amazingly good to boot. I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! No Sweat and great scent. Does last 48 hours.</li>
    <li> For a Clear gel deodorant it works pretty good especially when it comes down to not leaving stains on your clothes. The smell is pretty good and I would highly recommend it to any one who is active during the day and wants the reinsurance of being dry through out the day. I work security and during this time of the year I&#x27;m bundled up so I need a deodorant that will keep me dry and this is it. I was selected to test the Gillette Clear Cool Wave Deodorant for free and I must say that I have become a fan and I will be purchasing a 3 pack once I run out.</li>
    <li> Gillette Clear Gel rocks. I got no stinky pits.&lt;br /&gt;Mjk</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and you won&#x27;t have any white flakes.  Lightly scented which is nice.</li>
    <li> Okay I was using right guard xtreme before I was able to try this sample for free through #teaminfluenster. I like this product better than right guard because it is not sticky and just works better overall. Also I love how there is no residue marks like white deodorant. The only negative I have is that it takes a while to twist it out.</li>
    <li> I had tried gel deodorant/antiperspirant many years ago (don&#x27;t recall the brand) when it seems like the gels first became \\&quot;big\\&quot; - back in the late 1980&#x27;s/early 1990&#x27;s.  This may have been when they first introduced the gels (not sure). Trying this out reminded me why I didn&#x27;t like them back then - and it&#x27;s still why I don&#x27;t like them now. It makes my underarms feel wet/sticky, and it seems like it takes forever for it to dry. I feel like I need to flap my arms around like a bird to try and get it to dry faster, and I really don&#x27;t like putting on a shirt while I&#x27;m still feeling wet under my arms.  I do like the Cool Wave scent a lot.  Also - it has the same amount of the active ingredient as my regular deodorant/antiperspirant, and seems to control my sweating just as well as my regular.  Some people may really like the clear gel, but it&#x27;s not really for me.  I received a full size of this Gillette Cool Wave Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant for free in order to test it out and provide a review, but all opinions in this review are my own.</li>
    <li> Gillette Clear Gel is a great deoderant!  Coming from someone that has an active lifestyle, I still can smell fresh at the end of the day</li>
    <li> smells good and does pretty much what it claims, goes on without fuss and leaves no discernible mark. i leave one at work for the hotter days!  tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Overall this deodorant works pretty well and it smells pretty good too. I think my only gripe is how easily it gets messy. If you accidentally squeeze or drop the container you&#x27;ll likely end up shooting deodorant everywhere. You&#x27;ll also only need a small amount, which is good. If you use too much it feels really slick and goopy in your armpit. I did a free test of this deodorant, though all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free to test through the influenster app, and was a little bit apprehensive at first. I was pretty stuck in my &amp;#34;old spice&amp;#34; ways. Afree giving this one a try, I am definitely convinced that it&#x27;s pretty great! It stood up well throughout the whole day; through work, a workout, and classes it stayed strong. The scent is also pretty good!</li>
    <li> Gillette Clear Gel Cool Wave is a great deodorant and decent product but it can get messy.    Pro&#x27;s:  Smells great (subjective I know but I do appreciate the smell as does my wife)  Goes on easy - The gel goes on and kind of smothers along your skin as you guide the stick along your under-arm.  Hence it goes on easy.    Con&#x27;s:  Messy - If you don&#x27;t have a super wide armpit, it may get all over in some areas that you don&#x27;t want.  Imagine applying jam to a piece of toast.  You normally put it on part of the knife before you spread it right? Well, with this applicator, it&#x27;s like spreading the jam all over the knife.  So if your under-arm isn&#x27;t very wide, it gets kind of all over.  Melty - If you throw this in your gym bag, it&#x27;s not too bad.  If you throw it in your gym bag and leave it in the sun, it does get melty and liquidy and leak out.  Not a major issue, just something to note.    Overall, great protection with good scent.  I&#x27;d buy more if I wasn&#x27;t allergic to it.    Please note: I did receive this product free as a sample but all opinions are of my own.</li>
    <li> My day job is as a gymnastics instructor. I sweat nowhere near as much as my students, but it is an active job that often leaves me smelling a mess at the end of the day. I had the chance to receive this product for free in exchange for a review and, since I trust Gillette with other body care products, I thought I&#x27;d do the same for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that, overall, the 48 hour protection only applies if you&#x27;re doing absolutely nothing athletic. But c&#x27;mon, you apply deodorant every day no matter how long it&#x27;s SUPPOSED to last, right? Interestingly, the only day it seemed to fail was when I followed up a full day of intensive coaching with a four hour long drive. Other than that, it does get me through the day, though the scent isn&#x27;t my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Gel deodorant that dries quickly. (No white residue, no chunks falling out of the applicator.)&lt;br /&gt;Full day protection under normal conditions. (Let&#x27;s just wear deodorant every day, ok?)&lt;br /&gt;Smoothly working applicator (Others have complained about this, but I&#x27;ve had no problems. Could be that I&#x27;m used to gel deodorants and others reviewing this have not.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Not my favorite choice of scent (But hey, it was free, and if I was buying it, I&#x27;d choose one I like better)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t last all day under intensive use.&lt;br /&gt;Biggest con for me (and hence a 3 star rather than 4 star review) was the price. My usual deodorant - Right Guard Total Defense - is about half the price ($0.87 per ounce compared to $1.52 an ounce) and works better.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I would highly recommend for anyone especially men that travel.  There is nothing worse than having to fly long distances and have to walk into a meeting right after a long flight and feeling funky.  With this Cool Wave by Gillette you will never have to worry about that again.  The idea of this lasting 48 hours seemed absurd to me but seeing strong it is going after 24 hours of travel and meetings and waking up the next day and feeling fresh says a lot.</li>
    <li> I used the Gillette Clear Gel to see how I liked a Gel deodorant. First let me say the smell is excellent. Also, the product really did it&#x27;s job in the anti-perspirant department. I sweat a lot, but I stayed fresh for a full 24 hours. I noticed one day that I had residue marks on my shirt, which is something I thought I would avoid with the Gel. Personally, I didn&#x27;t like the wet feeling when applying the deodorant, but it was minimal and didn&#x27;t stay that way for more than a few minutes. Last, each morning I notice that overnight some gel squeezes out of the top of the tube making it slightly less convenient.  Btw, I was able to try this product for free and all these opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This is a fairly solid gel stick. It&#x27;s a little stickier than Mitchum, but has a subtle fragrance, and works for longer than 24 hours. Fortunately, my body isn&#x27;t a big BO offender, so I just put it on every other day after I shower. It takes a little while to dry (to not feel sticky), but it doesn&#x27;t leave a big residue. the twist mechanism feels a little cheap, as it doesn&#x27;t push out gel reliably with each twist.    I got to test Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Smells great, not too strong. Does exactly what its says and definitely keeps you dry. I recommend for folks that have pit stains and are constantly sweating. The applicator is definitely not the best but great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have been trying out the Gillette clear gel via a free sample i received from Influenster, however the opinions formed are soley mine... and i have to say i love it! The scent is really subtle, but still smells very fresh and clean. I workout every day on lunch so i need a deodorant that will help me make it through the rest of the day sweat free, and smelling good, this deodorant does both! I can feel it working everyday so it gives me the confidence to workout on lunch and go back to work feeling fresh. I love not having to skip a beat with my workouts so this allows me to keep my routine on track every day. Some deodorants leave you feeling unsure or not very confident and i can say i have never had that problem using this product. Its really a great product and i would recommend it for any active man!</li>
    <li> As an athlete I am in need of a very effective deodorant. My deodorant needs to keep me dry and smelling somewhat fresh. The clear gel does exactly that, some might even say too well. My armpits even stayed dry in the shower. I had to really scrub to get it off. Which isn&#x27;t a problem for me. The one hangup i have with gillette clear gel is the wet feeling you get immediately after application. I am accustomed to the gel sticks which do not give this feeling. Perhaps it was simply that i applied too much. Overall, while the wet feeling is uncomfortable for a little while it does not drive me away from the product. I would use this product again. I tested gillette clear gel for free but my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I can honestly say it is one of the best products I have used in a long time. The gel is nice and smooth to apply to your skin, it stops sweating and smell in the amount of time advertised, and it&#x27;s quite affordable. If I was to nit-pick something bad about this product, I would say that the twisting bit at the bottom could work more efficiently, but all in all, great product. I received this as a promotional trial for Gillette.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  The cool wave scent is pleasant and last all day.  There is also no white residue to get on your dark clothes.  The only complaint I have about this product is the gel texture is slimy if you are not used to it.  All in all it is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I tested this product for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> It lasts for 48 hours, you can&#x27;t beat that. I apply once in the morning before work. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about needing to reapplying after the gym if I wanted to go out. It&#x27;s not harsh on your underarms. I liked the scent, manly but not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary product for reviewing purposes but opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I  tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own. It has a cool smell I grew to love from the after shave and 48 hr protection is promising, its been 24 hours and no smell, I don&#x27;t think I usually go without showering or applying deodorant for that long but If I do and does or does not work will let you know.</li>
    <li> I had not used a Gel Deodorant in a long time until now.  I have used this product 2 days now and have had great results.  The product applies well to your underarm hair and skin.  The smell is great, and the clear gel is perfect for quick applications in a hurry without anyone knowing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below are the pros and cons In My Opinion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Clear Gel!&lt;br /&gt;2. Great Smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;1. The twist action to push the gel upwards sometimes pushes too much and other times takes a lot of twists to get any up, but other than that, works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Gillette Clear Gel Cool Wave for free, but the opinions above are my own and completely honest!</li>
    <li> Have used gel deodorant for awhile. Was given a free sample of Gillette. If you don&#x27;t want white marks on your clothes or the wetness of a roll on consider using this gell. If you use the correct amount it will not be wet or leave marks on clothing and keep you smelling clean all day!</li>
    <li> Ive used all kinds of deodorant.  Solids, Gels, Sprays, you name it. I was never a huge fan of anything other than solids until I used Cool Wave Clear Gel. It truly does have a cooling affect and especially in the summertime not only does it keep you dry and smelling fresh but also a cool refreshing feel. Affordable product from a world renowned company.  TRY IT!!</li>
    <li> I have been using clear gel for 15yrs or more. Never have had a body odor issue. Feels good, smells good, and actually lasts for a entire day. This antiperspirant really works. Even in the most stressful conditions it keeps your underarms nice and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a longtime user of Gillette&#x27;s clear gel line of antiperspirant/deodorants and have always been a fan. This new &amp;#34;48 hours of freshness&amp;#34; is a new claim, and I put it to the test. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette&#x27;s products have always been great for me. I haven&#x27;t found them to let me down in terms of wetness protection. About the only complaint is I&#x27;ve never found a scent that I could say &amp;#34;wow, that&#x27;s me&amp;#34; but then I also don&#x27;t use this type of product as a cologne. I also appreciate that unlike some competitors, the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming at application time and then throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically apply my antiperspirant in the morning after showering then again after any lunch-time workouts. I found that the lunch-time application didn&#x27;t seem to be necessary. When showering after those mid-day workouts, I can still feel it in place (and repelling water). Out of habit and just to &amp;#34;refresh,&amp;#34; I still apply it, but certainly feel I could go without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed in some of the reviews that people found the application messy. It&#x27;s true that this type of product - a gel - can get messy if you don&#x27;t dispense it slowly. I only turn the dial occasionally and instead squeeze the container gently to dispel a small amount. A little bit really does go a long way. I can go a few months on a single package. The only time I really find the container to be a mess is if I travel by plane or accidentally drop it - the change in pressure will cause product to get dispensed (but I have similar issues with other products - par for the course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming a similar price to what I currently use, I would continue to purchase this product. It&#x27;s just that much more assurance that&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll remain dry and odor-free no matter what my day brings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: I received this product for free to test, but this opinion is my own after testing it.)</li>
    <li> So i got the pleasure to test this for free and it has worked awesomely! It doesn&#x27;t leave a weird residue like the stuff I use to use. I will definitely be using this for now on. These are just my opinions</li>
    <li> I received Gillette Clear Gel from Influenster for free to test and review the product. Never been a fan of gel because of the feeling of it, however it smells good and does keep you dry all day and then some. I live in Phoenix AZ and applied it in the morning and went on an afternoon hike through the southern desert on a warm day. Gillette clear gel kept me dry and smelling good the whole duration of hike and rest of the day. So in my own opinion if you don&#x27;t mind the gel feeling its a great product that works and you should try it. And again I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free and these are my own opinions of the product.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive to try a gel deodorant, as I consider myself an old fashioned kind of guy. However, I was positively surprised by this product! It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and is the most effective deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. No reapplication is necessary, and even when I shower after a run, I don&#x27;t need to reapply! The twist function does not seem to work very well. I have had to squeeze the plastic container just the tiniest bit to get the product to come out of the applicator. I tested this product for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This Gillette Clear Gel Cool Wave (4 oz.) is long-lasting and smells huggably great! Bring on the close encounters and arm lifts with this. No more feeling sheepish about a spot of darkness under my arms. Plus, I really feel like a masculine man whenever I use this deodorant, even though I&#x27;m not that tall and I don&#x27;t have the most manly of tastes. I normally apply a thin later and rotate my arms like I&#x27;m rowing so that I massage the gel evenly. Then I let the gel do its magic.    This strong endurance gel works in the morning and lasts through the day--from nervous meeting presentations with 50+ eyes on me and some on my armpit area to slumping in a chair for 6-7 hours straight worrying about the next big editing deadline to waiting with bated breath after sending a rather offbeat holiday e-mail, hoping colleagues got the punchline. At a great affordable price and the awesomeness of having tested it for free, I can&#x27;t wait for morning to come when I can apply another layer and clap my arm down to feel the power of Gillette taking effect.    Feeling clean and ready never felt this good. I am more confident with this product, and confidence is what I need these days when it&#x27;s dark out earlier and holiday pressures mount. Looking forward to smiling at the Gillette section in the grocery store and winking at the competitors&#x27; products that my hands won&#x27;t reach for. I have found \\&quot;the one\\&quot; in Gillette.     tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> Awesome...! you can be protected all time...! Besides in Venezuela there is shortage about this product. Thanks to the seller...! God bless you...!</li>
    <li> This was a good product with a good smell and easy application. The one trouble that I had was the twister on the bottom took a few clicks and then the gel had a hard timing stopping. Word to the wise a click or two should do the trick and wait to make sure the gel doesn&#x27;t overflow.</li>
    <li> It smells great, and it dries fast, which is good. Maybe I&#x27;m really stupid, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make the gel rise into the pores of the stick. The dial at the bottom was really tough to turn, and didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. I ended up squeezing the deodorant stick to get more gel to come out. After a while, as you can imagine, the squeezing technique ceases to work.  But overall-- good product!</li>
    <li> My Husband was never a gel anti-perpirant user, the cold, wet feeling was something he could never get past. But this stuff definitely made him give it a send thought. It kept him dry even longer than advertised. initial application was cold yes, but within seconds completely unnoticeable. Four star product most definitely.</li>
    <li> I received Gillette clear gel free from Influenster for testing purposes. This deodorant worked very well and smells great. I would put this on in the morning and come home from work dry and smelling good. I work on my feet all day and sometimes outside so this worked really well.</li>
    <li> My husband very happy with Gillette.</li>
    <li> I usually use deodorant gel without the antiperspirant because I never quite know how rubbing aluminum zirchonium will affect my body chemistry. But since I got a chance to try it out, why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel doesn&#x27;t require much to get going so I think I over did it in the beginning. One turn of the dial is probably more than enough. The smell is great! But I was okay with just regular deodorant as well. The most obvious part is that my armpit really stopped sweating... in some way, it was uncomfortable since I don&#x27;t know what that means. Isn&#x27;t sweat a natural part of life? On the other hand, I can see how this can come in super handy for important, special occasions like dates and business meetings when you want to be at your best. I probably won&#x27;t be using this on a daily basis but will keep one for important occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: This product was given to me for free, but this review is my own opinion after testing the product)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use gel deodorants so it was kind of a different experience, so it was quite a messy experience. Once you get past the very wet pit feeling the smell is pretty nice and it does keep you dry for your daily adventures and the nightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Great protection. Fresh scent, but the applicator wastes some of the product.</li>
    <li> Works great, great smell, doesn&#x27;t leave a streak of white on your shirt like others tend to. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that either too much tends to come out at once, or I simply don&#x27;t know how to put it on correctly. There is really no indicator as to how much you are increasing it as you turn the dial. I kind of wish that there were &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; or something.</li>
    <li> I use to hate using clear gel deodorants because they use to always make my armpits burn! Not until I started using Gillette Endurance thanks to Influenster.com. I honestly would have to say that is it hands down the best deodorant I&#x27;ve used. Not only do my armpits not burn, but it has helped me stay fresh and most of all not sweaty throughout the day. I&#x27;m so glad I have found this deodorant. It is amazing and I totally recommend it! :)</li>
    <li> Amazing! goes on clear kept me dry all day and smells GREAT!</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodorant for a week now and it&#x27;s OK.  Not a big fan of the gel material it leaves on the arm pit when its applied.  It does dry after while but i prefer the solid.  Also....when i went to use it on the next application, there is a large amount of gel that appeared overnight from the air bubbles inside. I had to scrape it off with my finger and wipe it on a towel.  Complete waste of product!  I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of gel deodorant, but I really like the Gillette Clear Cool Wave. The past deodorant I have used that was gel seemed to run and smear all over my clothes while I was working or hitting the gym. I was surprised on how well this gel deodorant actually works. It leaves a cooling feeling while it is being put on, but that shortly goes away. It also smells pretty good also. I would say that it works very well, and will keep you from sweating severely and does keep you smelling fresh throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I used it multiple times after returning from the gym.  After using this deodorant, I felt fresh and I smelled good as well.  I like the scent of this deodorant; it isn&#x27;t too strong.  I was able to test this product for free because I belong to influenster.  This is a good quality product.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant as a promotional gift and I have to admit that I really like it, I had used clear deodorant in the last and had switched to powder deodorant but Gillette really made an awesome product you apply it once and you are good for the rest of the day. Love the scent. I would definitely recommend this product to all men who are interested in trying out a new deodorant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 1 month now. It works well as a deodorant/antiperspirant and it has a great smell. A little of it also goes a long way so it seems that the tube will last for a long time. The one down side is that it is very hard to dispense the gel. Sometimes almost none comes out when I twist it, other times a ton comes out when I twist it. They really need to improve the tube design and then this will be a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome deodorant to use, keeps you smelling good even during the hardest of days and I would recommend this to every one and anyone. I used to use spray deodorant but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be switching now!</li>
    <li> Gillette Endurance Cool Wave Clear Gel does exactly what you think it would--make you feel cool, tingly, and never smelly!  I always make sure I apply after my shower day or night to keep my pits smelling fresh and keeping odor away which can be challenging for a man!  Gillette Endurance goes on feeling cool and can kind of tickle but like it says on the cap it will keep you fresh for 2 days aka 48 hours!  I was able to try this product free from Influenster but these opinions are mine and mine only!  I use this product on my own anyways so getting to try it for free was a bonus!</li>
