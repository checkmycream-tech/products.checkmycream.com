<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Loved it . Only gel that works for my hair 😏✊</li>
    <li> great product, reasonable price, great hold.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t use this product i have a combover hairstyle and was disapointed in the quality&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t hold well if your looking for great all day hold use ELEGANCE GEL</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know any better, I had been using LA LOOKS for many years and now just by chance I came into contact with this product and I really love it.  I will be using this gel from now on and for many years to come, as long as I still have hairs.</li>
    <li> Works great! Great hold... Smells great! No flakey residue...</li>
    <li> My all time favorite hair gel</li>
    <li> The best hair gel you will ever use.  Works great for my tween boy!</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I needed. But it was what I ordered. Works well.</li>
    <li> My son has a double cow lick so we keep his hair fairly short. We have his hair cut so that it can be spiked up front and needed a gel to style his hair at home. We tried [[ASIN:B000H6F584 Circle of Friends Erik&#x27;s Shaping Hair Gel, 4 oz.]] first but it didn&#x27;t hold all day and would flake a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Johnny B Mode Styling gel was recommended to us by the kids haircut place we take him to. We use it to mat down his cow licks and to spike his hair in the front. It takes a few minutes to dry so we try to keep him from rolling around or putting anything on his head. After it dries it holds virtually all day. It washes out easily with kids shampoo and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a tiny bit strange for a two year old but not off putting or inappropriate. Compared to the other smells from my kid it is a welcome addition.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Cheaper than buying it at the barber.</li>
    <li> Good gel so far!  It has only been a couple of days but I am usually a pomade kind of guy.  I work in a restaurant so needed something that would hold better like a gel, this has been good so far and does not get hard, sticky, or flakey.  Does not have a lot of ingredients too because I know a lot of hair stuff have tons of ingredients that you do not even know what they are.</li>
    <li> This is the best gel i have ever tried and i have tried many. I am 47 years old so you can guess just how many i have tried.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, works great</li>
    <li> Does not damage hair, and does not leave any flakes. Perfect shine, and just like advertised perfect hold. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> BLUE DYE MAKES HAIR BLUE... BUY THE PURPLE (HARDER TYPE) GEL IS CLEAR. DO NOT BUY MODE</li>
    <li> great hold and a must for comb overs. has awesome shine.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, no flaky hair, smells good too</li>
    <li> Nice quality, great smell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and is the best. If you can find it in a salon it costs much more. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I have tried many Gels from Crew to Axe, to generic.  This is the best.  First of all, its a big jug that never ends.  I have had it for 3 weeks now and I have not even skimmed the surface.  It will probably last me all year for sure.  I use it daily, Goes on great with wet or dry hair.  Just a little bit does the work and it leaves it hard all day.  I put on a hat or touch my hair and no flakes.  This is a flake free gel.  I love it and if it ever runs out I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I use this on my 2.5 year old son&#x27;s hair. We use a tiny amount and it&#x27;s workable until dry. After its dry you can comb through it with it staying in place. Great for an extremely active child who&#x27;s hair looks nice even after being a crazy 2 year old.</li>
    <li> I first started using Johnny B Hair Gel when my barber use it on my hair. Since then I have not use other hair gels. Johnny B holds the hairstyle I have use since I was a kid. I recommend this to anyone who uses gel and looking for a hair gel that dont flake. If this is not strong enough Gel Johnny B also sells different kinds of hair gels.</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously amazing. I have 2 sons that swear by it. It actually holds your hair right where you put it, even if your hair is damp. It doesn&#x27;t dull your hair at all and it washes out very easily. Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t flake off white and leave dandruff looking residue behind. The price is amazing on Amazon too. I re-order it every month for them.</li>
    <li> I have always used gorilla snot, Axe, and Voss. They did okay on my hair but they all left a white flaky residue. I tried this for the first time and it did a perfect job. Not too hard, not too runny. I love my taper fad with spikes and everybody gave me compliments on how good it smells.</li>
    <li> Fake knock off product smell totally different texture everything for a regular user of this product very clear this is a knock off from the original Johnny b</li>
    <li> Former LA Looks user. I was hesitant to buy at first because it was more expensive than my usual gel. But after I purchased, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. A little goes a long way. The gel that was stuck to the lid lasted me 4 days alone. My hair stays styled all day and it doesn&#x27;t look like I slimed my head. The smell is subtle, but nice -like I just stepped out of the barber shop.</li>
    <li> Best gel I have ever used. But you should know the fragrance is strong. Smells great, but strong.</li>
    <li> After trying many different hair gels, Johnny B Mode is the best! It&#x27;s a little thick which helps hold your hair however you want to style it, as soon as you apply it. I love! the smell of it. Smells fresh and clean. Does not flake at all. Holds all day. Good shine. Washes out easy in the shower . Next time I&#x27;m buying the biggest bottle I can find. Recommend!</li>
    <li> Best hair gel ever! Never sticky, no flakes, smells great! Washes out wasily. Not greasy. A little goes a long way! I wont use anything else!</li>
    <li> Love it! The scent, the texture, and the effectiveness. Will buy some more!</li>
    <li> It dries really hard and flakes all over the place.</li>
    <li> Love the product but they raise the price so much!! My husband loves it because it&#x27;s light and holds pretty good</li>
    <li> From Gorilla Snot/Ice/Got2B/La Bella this is the best Gel I&#x27;ve used also gives a great smell will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> i like it.  Holds my hair.  smells good.</li>
    <li> cant keep the ladies off of me</li>
    <li> Works great. I have straight stubborn hair that never wants to stay down and this stuff keeps my hair down. It smells good too.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this particular gel before for our 4 year old son before although it was in a smaller tube. It works really well. What we like about it is that it does not leave a flaky residue after it dries and it lasts all day as well. The gel also doesn&#x27;t dry quickly so it gives you enough time to style/comb the hair and you do not have to worry about making mistakes. I would very happily recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this hair gel. Bought it for my husband and he loves it too, his hair looks way better with this gel then the gel he was using before and he doesn&#x27;t get those white flakes at the end of the day either! 👍 I recommend!!</li>
    <li> Been using this gel for a while now, love it. One tube of this size will last me up to a year.</li>
    <li> hair loves this gel....</li>
    <li> This gel never gives up or gives out holding hair in place, if I use it in the evening I wake up the next day my hair still done lol and it has a masculine smell almost like a good Cologne, totally worth it,  great price for the amount you get and leaves no flaking even after a few times using it between washing.  lasts me about 5 months very little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> the best smelling gel, i have ever use. all the bitches said i smelled good. the gel makes the hair easy to manage. its worth the price. it does not feel like paste in hair like other gels.</li>
    <li> I order this for my husband all the time who will not leave the house without gel. It smells great, lasts a LONG time and doesn&#x27;t flake. He also loves it because it holds his hair style without being extremely crunchy. I can&#x27;t find this anywhere else.</li>
    <li> not bad, but it makes your hair very sticky</li>
    <li> I discovered this product when I recently had to switch barbershops since my old barber moved. Smells great, doesn&#x27;t flake, has a strong hold and isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s hairstylist uses this gel and it&#x27;s so nice. Smells amazing and it really holds without being extremely stiff. Hair stays put all day. No flaking. We love this product!!!</li>
    <li> Always satisfied with Amazon and everything I prefer and the Johnny B Hair Gel is great I love it because the gel is not too hard when it dries and not too weak its perfect for my hair.</li>
    <li> this is what they use at my barber. It holds great and has a decent fragrance</li>
    <li> This gel sucks no hold its like using water on your hair waste of money</li>
    <li> Great product keeps hair looking wet all day without looking Dry</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product</li>
    <li> Best hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;🔹Firm hold&lt;br /&gt;🔹Doesn&#x27;t look greasy&lt;br /&gt;🔹Washes out easy</li>
    <li> This is not like most gels that wear off after a couple hours. This literally keeps your hair together all day. Definitely  worth  the buy.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair get that my grandson uses.  It doesn&#x27;t flake or dry out...it&#x27;s just perfect.  He&#x27;s 13 &amp; takes forever to get his hair combed just right and this lets him get what he wants.</li>
    <li> My hair lady first used this and I loved it so much I asked to buy it from her! Now the only place I&#x27;ve ever really seen it is on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spreads well through your hair, doesn&#x27;t flake, and smells great. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I wish I knew of these when I was younger. These don&#x27;t have any flakes and it last a long time for one person. You don&#x27;t need that much. The thing is great. I bought this because the barber guy told to me to buy it. That guy was a professional so he was a lot better with it than me, but I&#x27;m getting better.</li>
    <li> This is a great product have never seein anything better</li>
    <li> No sticky and wonderfull odor . Good modeling and stiling hair effect.</li>
    <li> seriously the best hair gel i have ever used! and i am a hair fanatic! i would greatly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not recommending these produce because it&#x27;s just like water is not good at all please don&#x27;t buy these Proadin</li>
    <li> Great jell. does wonders!!!</li>
    <li> Great hold without being stiff or sticky.  The girl who cuts my hair used and recommended this product.  It has a fresh fragrance and it not too heavy.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> If your looking for something that stays all day and doesnt lead to itching or flaking this is it, plus it has a great hold.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. The 16 ounce will last me several months.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great smell as soon as I open the can</li>
    <li> I have curly Jewish and very dry hair.  I&#x27;ve used so many different hair gels in the past to try and work with my hair.  The only one that came close to what I was looking for was the over-priced short and sexy hair.  Finally ... I found the one I&#x27;ve been looking for.  Johnny B hair gel has a slightly less hold than the short and sexy hair gel, but it still lasts all day long.  It comes out easy in the water/shower and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feel &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; after an application.  It also has a great scent, my wife often thinks I&#x27;m wearning cologne when really it&#x27;s just the scent of the hair gel.  It&#x27;s a very masculine scent.</li>
    <li> Well I bougnt this product because I tried it in a salon a long time ago and its exactly how I remember it masculine scent doesn&#x27;t flake or leave build up grips or styles remain through out the day strong and yet hop in the shower through some shampoo on and its off in minutes no hassle go to sleep forget to wash it out no worry no flakes no sticky left over no waking up with your head stuck to the pillow just get up wash off and reapply. Also wouldn&#x27;t recommend poor hygiene but only if you have to guys you can put this gel on go to bed wake up 12 hr later restyle it and be good to go for another 12 hrs your choice</li>
    <li> the tub of gel that arrived was practically half the size of the the one on the picture, The picture made me think that i was getting more for my money.</li>
    <li> Great product works on my 6 year olds hair and hold the style all day.</li>
    <li> Original product and fast shipping... will buy again ☺</li>
    <li> Smells good and works great!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair stuff around!</li>
    <li> Best hair gel by far!  No flakes or itchy scalp and the gel holds like a beast without making your hair feel like a helmet.</li>
    <li> My boys can live without it!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. Hard to find. I have fine, wavy hair that tends to kink. This keeps my &#x27;locks&#x27; together and my appearance sane.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair gel, smells good, feels good, holds on good, heck it even attracts good!!! A must get hair product for men....and women.</li>
    <li> The only gel that holds my hair however I want it, smells really good, gives a cool shine, and doesn&#x27;t gunk up. I usually have my sides faded and this gel always does the job for styling my hair on top (somewhat long). If you have a hairstyle that requires good hold, try this one. Chances are you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> The product is what it is.  If you like to use this, well obtaining this through amazon is great.  No issues with ordering or delivery.  I will order again.  If you are new to Johnny B, well give it a try if you are tired of hair gel that flakes and hardens up.</li>
    <li> Smells like cologne and not a lot is needed to hold my hair! Love it worth the $$</li>
    <li> My boyfriend had been searching for great hair product for a while. Finally this was a success! It smells great and holds well. We will be buying more in the future!</li>
    <li> Not bad not good just another cheap hair gel.</li>
    <li> very excellent product!! highly recommend!</li>
    <li> this product is so hard to find in store. but it hold hair great, smells amazing, and washes from hair quick.</li>
    <li> I started using this gel because a lady suggested it when she cut my hair. I have used it since then. This is the only gel that I have found that doesn&#x27;t smell like a girl and never causes my head to flake. Definitely a great product and it takes very little so the bottle lasts longer.</li>
    <li> My sister recommended this and I love it.  Try it tell em Jenny told you to. Why do I have to write so many words?</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Delivered 5 hours earlier than expected which is awesome. I really love how well the gel holds your hair.</li>
    <li> I use this on my toddler&#x27;s hair to comb over and it locks in for half the day. I add a little bit of water and it folds back for the remaining of the day.</li>
    <li> Great scent and smooth product holds down hair great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past, given to me by my barber. When this had arrived, it had no seal on it, anyone else expirence the same?</li>
    <li> almost time to buy some more. i love the smell of this stuff. a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! It&#x27;s not greasy feeling, it doesn&#x27;t leave any white flakes behind, and it smells good. I only use a little bit, what would fit on the tip of my index finger or so, and comb it in, it holds strong.  Note, in the rain, I do notice sometimes that my hair my get slimy, but I typically wear hats in the rain anyway, so no biggie.</li>
    <li> Great gel been using for years</li>
    <li> Johnny B is a high quality and alcohol free. I have been using it for years and no complains. Must try!</li>
    <li> My barber introduced me to this gel about 5 years ago and I must say it&#x27;s the best ever. You can use it with wet or dry hair and it will hold in hurricane force winds!! It&#x27;s also great that it doesn&#x27;t flake or leave any kind of residual residue. I&#x27;ve tried some of the other products in the Johnny B line but none of them are as good as Mode!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product fast delivery</li>
    <li> Love it recommend it to others let them try it they liked it too</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  Strong  hold and worth the money. I like the scent and my young kids love it too.</li>
    <li> Great hair product, nice smell</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  A little goes a long way.  My youngest goes to and leaves from school looking stylish.</li>
    <li> I understand I should have read the title because it does say it is 16 oz there, but the&#x3D;is feels like the ebay scams of the past where they sell you a picture and not the  product. I expected what was in the picture and i did not get that.</li>
    <li> Great hair gel that keeps a good hold without the stiff feeling. I apply this product to damp hair and then style to my liking. Holds all day with plenty of bounce and no stiffness. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great gel!  Bought it for my 2 boys, ages 7 and 9 because our hairstylist always uses it on them after she cuts their hair.  I wish it would have came taped around the top like it shows in the picture but it didn&#x27;t.  The 16 ounce is a great size, I feel it will last us a long time.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the gel that&#x27;ll give you that amazing johnny bravo hair from when we were young, this is it. All you need is a lot of hair and some aviators and you too can get rejected by women just like him!</li>
    <li> this product is Amazing and smells really really good !!!!!</li>
    <li> Brings me back to my favorite barbershop in Huntington Beach, CA  - This works works great and smells good too! I have thick hair and find this to work great and lasts all day. I pair this with some Got 2 be Glued and my hair stays spiked or combed over all day even taking off clothes or getting wet.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with being a cheap product but Id would rather pay for a better product.  It smells nice but thats it.  Hair was crunchy and dry.</li>
    <li> Great gel. Great price</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product twice in the last two months. The first one was five star all the way, it has a different texture and feel from cheap hair gel. The second one ordered about 45 days later was totally different. The container and everything seemed the same but when I used it, it was a completely different product. The gel sent was basically cheap $2 hair gel with blue dye and some perfume added in it. I still had a little left in the old tub to compare and I&#x27;m 100% sure its a knock off. I never thought someone would make counterfeit gel but go figure. Retuned.</li>
    <li> Not even a real product it was like water</li>
    <li> Best hair gel I ever bought smells good and no flakes it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> My son loves this gel, but he doesn&#x27;t get to use it now because he&#x27;s on restriction for taking too long in doing his hair in the morning before school. Haha.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and my son use this. It has a nice smell and does NOT flake like some gels.</li>
    <li> This product is very thick.  But, it&#x27;s not gooey or sticky.  It has a creamy texture and a nice, faint scent.  It&#x27;s not a girlie smell (I&#x27;m a guy).  It&#x27;s a nice, clean scent.  When I use just a little bit of this stuff on damp hair, my hair does what I want it to do.  I found that adding a little bit of water to this gel helps it go on easier and more evenly.  It washes off your hands very easily.  After your hair dries, it will be \\&quot;set\\&quot; all day the way you combed it.  But it might have that stiff look. You can brush it and it will stay in place and no longer look \\&quot;punk\\&quot;. If you use too much gel, your hair will become hard to the point where it could used as a weapon. Just comb it and it&#x27;ll be soft again without flaking.  After trying many products, this has become my favorite hair gel.</li>
    <li> Great gel.  Washes out easy.  Very light, but good hold</li>
    <li> First learned about this when I got a hair cut.  Great product - gel that dries but does not flake when dry.  Hold is great.</li>
    <li> What do i look for in Gel? I want it to hold my hair be able to run my hands though my hair without my hands getting stuck and being able to wash it of my hair at the end of the day easily. This product is all i was hoping for. I have had it for about two weeks and still love it. I use very little to spike the front part of my hair up. ....I am back after about 2 years of daily use I am finally running out. I would give this more than 5 stars if possible. Remember when using this product use a small amount.</li>
    <li> I have always having a problem with the Gel .. cuz my hair is so thick , it&#x27;s wavy tho but being thick make it tough for any Gel to stand the whole day !&lt;br /&gt;This One literally is one of a kind.. good hold, shinning all day long !&lt;br /&gt;Should definitely try it :)</li>
    <li> This gel not only does It hold, but it gives you a shine like no other gel before. Not to mention the smell is amazing as well</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY gel my boyfriend will use on his hair.  It holds great and it smells so good!!!</li>
    <li> finally a hair product that meets my expectations</li>
    <li> Outstanding hair gel. The best on the market in my opinion. Clean and holds well all day, no flaking &amp; smells great too!</li>
    <li> Not as strong as i thought it would be, but smells good and good hold</li>
    <li> Holds well, smells good and doesn&#x27;t lead to build up in the hair.</li>
    <li> Great masculine smell, and strong hold.</li>
    <li> Love this gel!!! It keeps my hair up the way I want it and maintains the shine for awhile!! AND THE BEST PART IS THE AWESOME SMELL</li>
    <li> Excellent product did exactly as stated.</li>
    <li> An awesome product! Non-heavy, non- oily, non-flakey and works great! Apply lightly. Not much is needed because this product is so easy to style with! Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in all of 2014! Plenty of it comes with the order so no need to use it wisely.</li>
    <li> holds hair well, alcohol based but when the alcohol burns off it works less as an adhesive but more as a gum that slowly flakes into non-observable white powder.  No dandruff effect.  Continues to add weight to the hair after you&#x27;ve undone the quaff.</li>
    <li> I Think this Hair Gel Deserves Five Stars. I First saw the hair gel at Bullets barbershop they used it in my hair after my Haircut which seemed unusual But it gave off a Smell that I liked and I like that its Made out of a Water solution it Smells Really good Great hold and the Jar is huge It has plenty of gel to go around for about 4 months if used properly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years now. Smells great and holds extremely well. Does not leave any flaky residue at all.</li>
    <li> Has a great hold to it as well as a nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;been using this product for a couple of years now.&lt;br /&gt;This size container lasts me about a year and I&#x27;m about ready to get my third one.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE SMELL BUT DOES NOT WORK WELL AT HOLDING UP THICK HAIR!!! i have thick hair and i tried using this for my pompadour but it did not give it the clean slick looked like Suavecito did!</li>
