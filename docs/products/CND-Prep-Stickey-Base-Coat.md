      <li>/&gt;This is great for people who cant get their nails done on a frequent basis.</li>
      <li>Great if you like to change your nail polish frequently.</li>
      <li>I do use it in conjunction with the CND SUPER SHINEY TOP COAT which I refresh every 2 or 3 days.</li>
      <li>I also have Creative Nail Design&#x27;s top coat in this large size bottle.</li>
      <li>this is a HUGE bottle.</li>
      <li>It is a HUGE bottle so it will be quite awhile though.</li>
      <li>The big bottle (about the size of a handball/raquet ball) is great for lots of manicures.</li>
      <li>With this size, you&#x27;ll never have to buy it again, and honestly, I probably wouldn&#x27;t because of the smell haha</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I finally found something to keep my polish in tact.</li>
      <li>It dries fast and work great and also protects my nails very well.</li>

      <li>SO worth the money.</li>
      <li>Super fast delivery!  </li>
      <li>The bottle was sent in a box, and pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>so you can start applying polish right away.</li>
      <li>I just started noticing a thicker consistency with my top coat, so since I&#x27;m ordering a new one of those, I thought I&#x27;d get a new one of these too (after 8 years!)</li>
      <li>My nails will last a good 4-5 days, longer if I touch up with a top coat every other day.  </li>
      <li>Works well and dries very fast</li>
      <li>excited to try new colors for this week.</li>
      <li>This is wonderful base coat especially when used with Creative NAil Design Super Shiney top coat.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It really does keep my polish on!</li>
      <li>If I put a top coat on daily</li>
      <li>Im sure it would last for another week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years and it is the best base coat I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I purchased a small bottle a year ago and loved it, so I thought this larger bottle would really fit the bill.</li>
      <li>I had previously used this product and loved it, this bottle must be old or out of date, product didn&#x27;t stick as well and peeled off within hours of application.</li>
      <li>I get ready to repaint my nails.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Seems to hold the polish on really well.</li>
      <li>I used this with CND 7 day polish and when I took the polish off my nails are much stronger.</li>

    <li> Love this! It really does keep my polish on! I use it mostly for my toes and I don&#x27;t have to redo them every few days</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Seems to hold the polish on really well.</li>
    <li> I started using this base coat in beauty school 8 years ago (I bought it from Maly&#x27;s). I used it while working as a nail tech for a couple years after beauty school. 8 years later, I am still using it (the same bottle)! This base coat just seems to work the best for me and everyone whose nails I do is amazed at how long their polish lasts...I truly believe it is this base coat and the top coat I use. I use it with Creative&#x27;s super shiney top coat (purple in round bottle like this one) and I usually get about 1 week wear with my nail polish with the normal fading at the top from typing and such...for pedicures, my polish lasts a month with no chipping or anything. I just started noticing a thicker consistency with my top coat, so since I&#x27;m ordering a new one of those, I thought I&#x27;d get a new one of these too (after 8 years!) They are seriously the only two I will EVER use!</li>
    <li> Best base coat in the world.</li>
    <li> have not used yet, but should be good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used OPI&#x27;s natural nail basecoat for a while, but have noticed some peeling at the side of my nail whenever I apply lotion or cuticle cream.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this a try, and it seems to work fine, no chipping for complete 3 days which is very rare event for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied and I&#x27;ll update my review when I see the chipping.</li>
    <li> I like this product.does a good job.</li>
    <li> This is the best base coat. Before using this I had shellac on my nails for months causing them to be very thin. I used this with CND 7 day polish and when I took the polish off my nails are much stronger. I also use this with Jamberry stickers.</li>
    <li> worrks pretty good but for the size and prisw seemwd lile a good deal to le at the time kaybe it.qas maybe no</li>
    <li> I had previously used this product and loved it, this bottle must be old or out of date, product didn&#x27;t stick as well and peeled off within hours of application. Totally frustrating to keep redoing nails throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful base coat especially when used with Creative NAil Design Super Shiney top coat.  I use both with Essie nail color, and the color stays on for over a week with no chipping.  I was introduced to these two CND products when I had a manicure at Elizabeth Arden, and I have used them ever since.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It helps to keep polish on longer.  I use it as a base, and between coats.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I haven&#x27;t had time to keep going in to the salon regularly every two weeks to get my nails done. I also didn&#x27;t have the time to be redoing a complete manicure every day or two when my home applied version became too unbearably chipped to continue wearing. I loved the CND SHELLAC AND POLISH I had applied at the salon and considered getting several myself. I own about 200 polishes already however and so when I saw this product and read the reviews I was compelled to try it. I am so glad I did. With it I am able to keep my manicure looking great for almost the full two weeks And I was able to use the wealth of polish choices I already own. This saves me the $35 every two weeks and I can do it whenever I can find time vs trying to schedule an advance appointment. I do use it in conjunction with the CND SUPER SHINEY TOP COAT which I refresh every 2 or 3 days. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s necessary but it&#x27;s a practice I&#x27;ve always done to extend the life of my manicures. I  think I&#x27;ll probably try extending that time and experiment but I am ecstatic with just applying a quick top coat occasionally vs. redoing an entire manicure and having to deal with the dry time that entails. The product applies smoothly and dries quickly. My seller had a back order for this product due to demand but kept me informed and responded promptly when there was an error in the size I was initially shipped. I am extremely happy with the customer service I recieved. They apologized for the error, I was sent the correct size and I was also not asked to return the smaller bottle that I was initially sent as I had expected. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better response. I will order from beauty warehouse again and I will never be without this product again. It is a HUGE bottle so it will be quite awhile though. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This base coat seems to really grip your polish and help it last longer.  I really enjoy the large bottle.</li>
    <li> In combination with the Super Shiney Top Coat from CND my brittle nails that use to chip after few days lasted almost 5 days!  My new favorite.</li>
    <li> This is by FAR my favorite base coat.  Keeps my polish in place for about two weeks on average, as long as I follow up with the Super Shiney top coat (also by CND). I would recommend this base coat to anyone who likes to keep their polish in tact for more than just a few days... nothing better!</li>
    <li> LOVE this base coat!  Helps my manicure stay on for an entire week of working, doing household chores and drumming.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> When I first got this product I thought it was great.  After using for quite some time now, don&#x27;t see any great benefit of this product</li>
    <li> I have never used the smaller version of this product so I can&#x27;t compare it to that, but I do know that this product sucks.  The very next day my nails are chipped at the tips.  Big chunks of nail polish can be peeled off my nails when a corner near the base starts to come up.  Thought I was saving money by buying a bigger version - but it appears I wasted my money instead.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this Basecoat because of the price, but being One of those people that like to do my nails but I hate when it peels off in one clean sheet the day later I had to give it a shot, what did I have to lose? I am so thrilled by this product I love CMD sticky basecoat</li>
    <li> This is a large bottle that will last for a while and at a good price. Also a great product.</li>
    <li> I am a manicurist. The best base coat I have found.  Been using for about 9 years now and am very happy</li>
    <li> For the longest time, I&#x27;ve always just used nail polish by itself, only to get horrible chipping of course. I&#x27;ve always known that I needed a base coat, but I&#x27;ve never tried it. CND Stickey is phenomenal! I use it with Seche Vite top coat and my polish doesn&#x27;t go anywhere! My only question is why haven&#x27;t I used this before? Never turning back!</li>
    <li> This is the best base coat I have ever used.  use it with Super shiny and it is the bomb.  I send this and super shiny to my daughter and her friends down in St. Thomas and they absolutely rave about it.  Try it!</li>
    <li> Really like this stuff. helps my polish stay put! Use it every time. I have some in our camper too.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Period!</li>
    <li> Extends the life of my manicure like no other. If I use it as the base and also &amp;#34;sandwich&amp;#34; it between the two coats of color polish, I can go almost a week with no chips and barely noticeable tip wear, and this is through daily showering, lots of typing, washing a few dishes, and occasional cooking.</li>
    <li> Item accurately described; fast shipment; Great Seller!  Thank You!!</li>
    <li> This base coat helps my regular polishes last a lot longer.  An awesome purchase.</li>
    <li> Helps nail polish stay on longer. Very good product</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Stickey Base Coat really helps my color adhere to my nail well. I like to apply one coat and then wait for it to dry almost all the way/ completely (about 2-3 min) because it does actually get this, for lack of a better word, slight tacky feeling. I use this (combined with a nightly application of Barielle nail strengthener cream) daily to make my manicure last a week before any large chips occur.  Maybe by day 5 I notice some \\&quot;wear\\&quot; at the very end of my nail, but no actual chips) SO worth the money.</li>
    <li> I do my own nails because I like to mix up the colors to create different combos for a french manicure.  So, I needed a strong base coat for all that work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this base coat, my nails did not start to chip for about 7 days.  That is 6 more days than any CVS product.  If I put a top coat on daily Im sure it would last for another week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im excited to try new colors for this week.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s worth every cent!  I had my nails done a week ago and they&#x27;re still in very good condition!</li>
    <li> Good base coat and doesn&#x27;t turn your nails yellow</li>
    <li> I got this base coat after reading about it on a blog.  I like it because it does create a sticky base for the polish to adhere to.</li>
    <li> This is the basecoat many salons use... this is a HUGE bottle. Also the size many salons use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for a while now and really love it. Very thin and basic... good basecoat!</li>
    <li> Sticky base + shiny top coat &#x3D; the best manicure you can give yourself at home. Works great with my Julep colors. It also provides a thick protectant coat for my weak nails.</li>
    <li> I polished my nails with this, a holigraphic polish friday with the CND shiny top coat. I spent Saturday and Sunday elbow deep in spackel and tearing up walpaper boarder and peeling it off wometimes with my nails. I have a tiny bit of a chip on my index finger but nothing you can really notice. This stuff is amazing. My polish never stays this well, even when I go to the salon.</li>
    <li> First this base, then OPI color and finish with Out The Door topcoat and you have a two week manicure.</li>
    <li> I love CND Stickey. I won&#x27;t use any other base coat because Stickey out performs all others! Don&#x27;t let Stickey dry - immediately after application, apply your first coat of nail lacquer. I do my nails every 3-4 days, so I can&#x27;t speak to how long Stickey helps my manicure last. But I rarely have chipping and I know that&#x27;s due to Stickey.</li>
    <li> 5 days later and only one chip! Thats not bad at all considering I have gone to the beach 3 days of the five, and have washed my hair and done dishes everyday. My nails have been thru alot. The key thing here is... to NOT to let it dry before applying the color nail polish. This stuff really is great though. I&#x27;m sure my nails would have been chip-free longer, if I used a good clear top coat--which i used none. If you aren&#x27;t sure about buying the larger size bottle (2.3 oz), Id definitly consider getting the smaller one to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for people who cant get their nails done on a frequent basis. A regular manicure from the salon usually lasts about 2...the most.. 3 days with me. They chip instantly and you feel like it was a waste. You can&#x27;t beat doing your own nails at home with this stuff and basically get a full work week with nice nails!</li>
    <li> This product came timely.  I have used this product for many years and it is the best base coat I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marilyn F., Carlsbad, CA</li>
    <li> This is a great base coat! It dries fast and work great and also protects my nails very well. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I loved this as a base coat. I like it because I don&#x27;t have the tinted nails anymore I really enjoyed this product.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY base coat I&#x27;ve tried that actually will extend the life of my regular-polish manicure. I use this all the time when I don&#x27;t feel like using my shellac system, or when I want to do nail art using tape. I tried the anchoring base coat by china glaze and it just didn&#x27;t work for me AT ALL. I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> Ever since my wife has started using this, her nails haven&#x27;t chipped. It is now her go-to base coat for when she does her nails.</li>
    <li> I think this CND product is what makes my thin, bendy nails keep polish on for more than a day. The big bottle (about the size of a handball/raquet ball) is great for lots of manicures. The picture doesn&#x27;t show that there is a brush in the cap. However, I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;m going to need to pour out the bottom into a glass manicure cup to get the rest out. The coat is thin and dries fast. It evens out my nails, too. I also have post acrylic truama nails, so considering that, and how well it helps keep a polish on, I&#x27;m impressed. The bottle was sent in a box, and pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> This base coat worked wonders for the staying power of my nail polish. I am a fairly busy person and am always doing things with my hands, whether it&#x27;s the dishes or cleaning projects around the house. My nail polish always chipped or peeled off within 3-4 days, but the times I used Stickey base coat, my polish lasted at least a week. I change my polish because I want to, not because I have to anymore! This was a great purchase, and the larger size will last me a long while.</li>
    <li> Once again, happy I found this here!  Jar is big enough it should last for a while!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure if it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to (this is my first time trying this, but I find it unusually watery), but this stuff stinks up to high heaven!!! Lol. With this size, you&#x27;ll never have to buy it again, and honestly, I probably wouldn&#x27;t because of the smell haha</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with the quality of this product. It protects nails from yellowing and extends the life of a typical manicure by a week.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I use it everytime I get ready to repaint my nails.  Best product I have found to date.  Always looking for great shipping deals1</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst base coats I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I&#x27;m not very picky about base coats. When I was in cosmetology school, a friend/classmate of mine bought this and seemed to love it. I was leery (even in professional cosmetology stores, this stuff is still $12-$13) but I needed something for state board practice (which is done on a plastic hand). Afterwards I started using it on myself, and it is awful! Even after thoroughly cleaning your nails, it still peels terribly. My nail polish comes off in almost a solid piece!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I refused to use it on clients. Whether you&#x27;re in school, in a salon, or just a lover of polish, I highly recommend China Glaze base coat. It stays tacky so that your polish actually sticks to it.</li>
    <li> I nolonger go to the salon since I now know what they use to keep that polish on. This stuff really is a must for painting natural nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> love this stuff! works great to keep on nail polish longer</li>
    <li> I had a manicure and she used this on my nails before she applied my OPI nail polish. Now I can barely get my nail polish to last 2 days normally so when it stayed on for over a week I was impressed. BUY THIS NOW!!!</li>
    <li> I also have Creative Nail Design&#x27;s top coat in this large size bottle. Great if you like to change your nail polish frequently. Works well and dries very fast so you can start applying polish right away.</li>
    <li> This product is great - just what I was looking for.  My manicure lasts a week, and I do them myself and it&#x27;s solely due to this product.  This CND line is a great line, and this sticky base coat really does it&#x27;s job!</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery!  Very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> I purchased a small bottle a year ago and loved it, so I thought this larger bottle would really fit the bill. What a disappointment!  I&#x27;ve used it twice and both times the polish comes off of my nail almost in its entirety.  This bottle seems to be a watered down version of the small one, it is so thin in texture ... almost like brushing water over your nails.</li>
    <li> I love painted nails but my nails just don&#x27;t hold polish well.  They tend to chip after a day, even when using a good top coat.  I tried this base coat and love it! My nails will last a good 4-5 days, longer if I touch up with a top coat every other day.  I&#x27;m so happy I finally found something to keep my polish in tact.</li>
