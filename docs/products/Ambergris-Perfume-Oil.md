      <li>I am so glad I found Ambergris Perfume Oil on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not only a man-magnet, its&#x27; a great comfort scent!</li>
      <li>Okay, here is the review.  </li>
      <li>Had excellent service from this seller but who knew one tiny drop of Ambergris is so strong?</li>
      <li>It smells VERY sweet, and almost rotten and overpowering.</li>
      <li>More civilized methods were created to avoid harming the civet and beaver while inducing it to spray.  </li>
      <li>it is just so strong that I can&#x27;t get away from it and therefore makes me not feel so well.</li>
      <li>its really, really strong.</li>
      <li>The older, and more petrefied, the better, and more valuable.</li>
      <li>I became interested in Ambergris after smellin it from a very famous and rare perfume oil company.</li>
      <li>This is a very exotic fragrance, although equal amount of people say it isn&#x27;t authentic while others say it is.</li>
      <li>The scent does resemble Amber, which I love, however it is far from authentic Amber in its source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a slightly medicinal and smokey sweet amber-ish type fragrance sort of like sweet smokey embers, would smell nice on the right man but equally good on a woman.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s got a spicy and sweet smell to it.</li>
      <li>Although it is not a bad smell, it is not the smell</li>
      <li>I receive many compliments, and was most recently told that my fragrance was &amp;</li>
      <li>If you are looking for an exotic smell I highly recommend this oil.</li>
      <li>I knew there was something in the scent I didnt like, haha!!</li>
      <li>, dont wanna scare people, haha!!)</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was hoping for!  </li>
      <li>and I have loved all the other scents I have purchased from this company.</li>
      <li>it should smell half digested, and kind of nauseating.&lt;br /&gt;this one smelled sweet and perfumey</li>
      <li>and I will DEFINITELY be back for more.</li>
      <li>The Amber is a better option for a lighter version of a very similar smell to this one</li>
      <li>I used to love the scent of the Sunshine Essentials Ambergris (it used to be sold in health food stores in a small glass bottle with a wood top) and was heartbroken when they discontinued it.</li>
      <li>and it is EXACTLY what I was hoping it would be.</li>
      <li>The product has a warm and slightly smokey-sweet aroma.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Ambergris which is a large piece of something like a gallstone excreted by certain whales and washes up on beaches.  </li>
      <li>After a wile, it positively grossed me out, as it lingers for days on clothing, it smells VERY organic.</li>
      <li>If interested in an Ambergris make sure you search for the all natural oil that has been processed properly.</li>
      <li>Add a tiny bit to your favorite scent and experience something new.  </li>
      <li>Has a very woodsy, smokey smell to it, and you can smell it for 3 days.</li>
      <li>I miss the real Ambergris, J. C. Penney used to sell.</li>
      <li>is&#x27;s real or synthetic is a moot point.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t notice too much of a smell.</li>
      <li>it really stands out.</li>
      <li>scents like Ambergris were designed to add a particular note to whatever attar you are wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but this is high quality.</li>
      <li>I love these oils but this one is little too &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; for my taste.  </li>
      <li>With regard to another reviewer&#x27;s negative comment - It is quite strong, and may be somewhat overpowering at first if you use too much.</li>
      <li>I have looked for it all over the area I live in and couldn&#x27;t find it.  </li>
      <li>Personally, I like that, because that just means it will last longer, as it takes only a tiny touch to give that wonderful scent which I have been so missing.</li>
      <li>I was even grossed out, and practically passed out when I first smelled the bottle, but its grown on me over the last couple weeks</li>
      <li>This Ambergris is seemingly natural, long lasting and blends well with Musk or &amp;#34;sweet woodsy scents&amp;#34; My slave bought this for me, simply put I love it</li>
      <li>you buy pure labdanum oil, smells the same and is cheaper</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Madini attars since the early 90s and swear by them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Synthetic musk oil was developed to avoid killing a deer.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Recently a procedure was developed to remove the musk pod from the deer without killing it.</li>
      <li>But mixed in proper proportion with other ingredients can result in an exotic fragrance.</li>
      <li>It is difficult to describe, but is very lovely.  </li>
      <li>Deer musk obtained humanely is more expensive by the kilo than pure</li>

<li> Not a pretty scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I purchased this oil based off of the other reviews here.</li>
<li> Hardly any fragrance and the bottle is almost empty and I only bought it a few weeks ago.</li>
<li> /&gt;It was a strange smell, hard to describe.</li>
<li> I researched it, I found out it comes from aged Whale poop, literally!!!</li>
<li> What a waste of $20.00.  </li>
<li> Whales used to be killed to obtain ambergris</li>
<li> years ago, musk was removed from perfumes as the musk deer had to be killed to remove the musk pod.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly what I was hoping for!  So many knock offs out there but this is high quality.</li>
    <li> This is a very exotic fragrance, although equal amount of people say it isn&#x27;t authentic while others say it is. It has a slightly medicinal and smokey sweet amber-ish type fragrance sort of like sweet smokey embers, would smell nice on the right man but equally good on a woman.  Some more conservative types may not like it though.</li>
    <li> This is good but STRONG!! It takes some getting used too. I was even grossed out, and practically passed out when I first smelled the bottle, but its grown on me over the last couple weeks and I wear it sometimes, (when Im home, dont wanna scare people, haha!!) its really, really strong. Like Amber(which I Love) and burnt Cedar. Has a very woodsy, smokey smell to it, and you can smell it for 3 days. A drop goes a looonngg way. Id say its authentic.I became interested in Ambergris after smellin it from a very famous and rare perfume oil company. It was 100% authentic Ambergris, I ordered a sample of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a strange smell, hard to describe. After a wile, it positively grossed me out, as it lingers for days on clothing, it smells VERY organic. Id tried out the sample based on the romantic notion that somebody wrote a song about it...The scent does resemble Amber, which I love, however it is far from authentic Amber in its source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I researched it, I found out it comes from aged Whale poop, literally!!! Aged and petrified whale vomit/poop floating around in the oceans and lodging itself along the rocky coastlines for people to find thruout the centuries. The older, and more petrefied, the better, and more valuable. I googled pictures and it was scary/horrifying disgusting, intestinal looking brownish mass sitting on a marine biology lab table. I took a whiff of my sleeve again, and it was about to wretch. I knew there was something in the scent I didnt like, haha!!</li>
    <li> extremely disappointed. Hardly any fragrance and the bottle is almost empty and I only bought it a few weeks ago.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, sweet scent! Very long lasting! I have used it in a couple of my creations and find it pulls things together very nicely!</li>
    <li> smells amazing and uncommon. it really stands out. it&#x27;s got a spicy and sweet smell to it. i would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This ambergris oil smells like the incense in church. Although it is not a bad smell, it is not the smell I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;The package was delivered well ahead of time and was almost gift wrapped. The company was good but the oil wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice too much of a smell. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is not what I thought it would be. I still have it, but I don&#x27;t use it. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love these oils but this one is little too &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; for my taste.  It&#x27;s not the products fault and I have loved all the other scents I have purchased from this company. The Amber is a better option for a lighter version of a very similar smell to this one</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil based off of the other reviews here. I find the smell to be absolutely sickening. It smells VERY sweet, and almost rotten and overpowering. There is certainly no ambergris in this product as it doesn&#x27;t last on the skin like ambergris is supposed to.</li>
    <li> Not the Ambergris I knew at all. Smells like burned wood. I miss the real Ambergris, J. C. Penney used to sell.</li>
    <li> Fake Ambergris.  This is Frankincense oil, possibly mixed in with a few other essences.  Value of item based on essential oil prices - less than a dollar or two, bottle and fancy gift wrap included.  This is not Ambergris Oil.</li>
    <li> GORGEOUS amber, with smoke-by-the-bonfire. It&#x27;s not only a man-magnet, its&#x27; a great comfort scent! Best for night, cool weather, and rainy days.</li>
    <li> ambergris should smell.....well- it should smell half digested, and kind of nauseating.&lt;br /&gt;this one smelled sweet and perfumey, i think it would be quite popular.</li>
    <li> This is an extremely cheap knock off that results in the most horrible smell you can experience! It smelled old and rotten and was hard to get rid of the scent. If interested in an Ambergris make sure you search for the all natural oil that has been processed properly.</li>
    <li> Had excellent service from this seller but who knew one tiny drop of Ambergris is so strong? I can&#x27;t even describe the scent. It&#x27;s earthy. It doesn&#x27;t smell BAD it is just so strong that I can&#x27;t get away from it and therefore makes me not feel so well.</li>
    <li> NOT AMBERGRIS ---DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT IS NOT AMBERGRIS. WE HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF..</li>
    <li> Excellent seller A++++</li>
    <li> Smells nice, but I think is more about cistus labdanum than ambergris.&lt;br /&gt;If you buy pure labdanum oil, smells the same and is cheaper</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this aroma.  Okay, here is the review.  I ordered this product, and it arrived promptly.  It was packaged very nicely inside a decorative box with padding, which was inside a shipping box.  The product has a warm and slightly smokey-sweet aroma.  It is difficult to describe, but is very lovely.  I tend to purchase high-end fragrances, so I hoped this would exceed my expectations.  It surely did.  I receive many compliments, and was most recently told that my fragrance was &amp;#34;very lovely, but not in a &#x27;perfume-y&#x27; way...&amp;#34;  My only wish is that I could purchase this in a larger container.  Very nice... Not for everyone, but very nice!</li>
    <li> Madini Ambergris smells wonderful as a stand alone scent or is to be used to enhance or add a note to your regular perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether is&#x27;s real or synthetic is a moot point.  All of this &#x27;sexy&#x27; discussion is superfluous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most scents like Ambergris were designed to add a particular note to whatever attar you are wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, castoreum, which is extracted from male/female beavers, adds a leathery note.  Musk adds softness.  And then we have civet which adds yet another note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just need a drop or two of any animal note to change the personality of your favorite scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several years ago, musk was removed from perfumes as the musk deer had to be killed to remove the musk pod.  Synthetic musk oil was developed to avoid killing a deer.  In the case of civet, the animal had to be beaten with sticks or totmented in order to get the civet to spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The civet is a distant relative of the cat family. In its raw form civet smells similar to a cat&#x27;s spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently a procedure was developed to remove the musk pod from the deer without killing it. Ditto with the beaver. More civilized methods were created to avoid harming the civet and beaver while inducing it to spray.  Deer musk obtained humanely is more expensive by the kilo than pure gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ambergris which is a large piece of something like a gallstone excreted by certain whales and washes up on beaches.  Whales used to be killed to obtain ambergris&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of these animal by products smell quite foul by themselves.  But mixed in proper proportion with other ingredients can result in an exotic fragrance. Chanel #5 uses a civet derivarive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarins is currently under fire for using coumarin to add a vanilla note to its Angel fragrance . Coumarin is related to COUMADIN...a blood thinner, so a persom wearing Angel could possibly develop a blood clot or stroke merely by spraying  Angel on their body where it penetrates the skin and hits the blood stream where could harm the wearer. Beware of vanilla extract made in Mexico..chances are that it could be made with coumarin beans rather than vanilla beans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased a few vials of pure black deer musk from Malaysia .  Not a pretty scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In essence, Madini oils are the finest.  Add a tiny bit to your favorite scent and experience something new.  Madini Ambergris also smells great on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t judge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Madini attars since the early 90s and swear by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading my review of Madini Ambergris.</li>
    <li> This is Jack&#x27;s wife - I ordered this and it is EXACTLY what I was hoping it would be. I used to love the scent of the Sunshine Essentials Ambergris (it used to be sold in health food stores in a small glass bottle with a wood top) and was heartbroken when they discontinued it. This is the closest match I have ever found and I will DEFINITELY be back for more. With regard to another reviewer&#x27;s negative comment - It is quite strong, and may be somewhat overpowering at first if you use too much. Personally, I like that, because that just means it will last longer, as it takes only a tiny touch to give that wonderful scent which I have been so missing. Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This Ambergris is seemingly natural, long lasting and blends well with Musk or &amp;#34;sweet woodsy scents&amp;#34; My slave bought this for me, simply put I love it, he was a good &amp;#34;boy&amp;#34; Madini Oils are incredibly sense enlightening &amp; delightful! It gets a five star!</li>
    <li> very bad smell, nothing like the natural ambergris</li>
    <li> Definitely NOT ambergris!!!  This stuff smells like frankincense.  I do not like the scent at all.  What a waste of $20.00.  Will not buy from madini again.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found Ambergris Perfume Oil on Amazon. I have looked for it all over the area I live in and couldn&#x27;t find it.  I love the smell and it is just as I remembered it. If you are looking for an exotic smell I highly recommend this oil. I get so many comliments when I put it on. That infact I ordered another bottle just recently.</li>
    <li> Pay no mind to the negative reviews of madini ambergris.This by far the best perfume I have ever come across!The scent is unisex and it can be comined with some of your colognes to make the scent last longer. It can also be worn by itself like I do mostly.$15 is a bargain for a scent that is as ancient and priceless.</li>
