<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Mind you I have causcasian hair but it stated works for all hair types....Ive washed my hair since using about 6 times and I can still feel the grease...buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I have been using the oil for about 4 weeks my hair has stopped failing out, I havent seen much growth but I was told it takes time for it to show any growth</li>
    <li> Doing great....hair feels great too!</li>
    <li> The product did not show any wonders. Was hoping to have smooth and thick hair but no..it did not worl..Would not recommend!</li>
    <li> I am a Caucasian female with very dry frizzy hair. I use the doo gro products with great success. In June my hair was to the bottom of my ear lobe now 8 mths later it is past my shoulder blades. I do not even use this product but maybe 3 times a week at most and I got those results. Imagine if you use it more often. This is a great product no matter your skin color. I read alot of reviews on their other products complaining about it being to oily first its an oil it will add moisture and second if its that oily you are using way to much of it.</li>
    <li> it does absolutely nothing accept smell good. it didnt make my hair grow</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the product and may order it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from a local grocery store for a little under 7$ based on reviews I found here. I am a caucasian female early 20&#x27;s with lightened hair.I have been losing a lot of hair due to damage and stress. I was hoping this would help me grow my hair out longer and make it thicker. When I tried putting it on my roots and hair when damp, it made my hair look greasy. This has prevented me from really trying it because I shower at night and don&#x27;t want to wake up the next morning and have greasy looking hair all day. When I did use it as a hot oil treatment though, my hair looked healthier afterwards. The one thing that I love the most about this product is that a little goes a long way and that it smells divine. The scent is just intoxicating. I am in the process of trying it as an overnight treatment under a shower cap along with coconut oil and will see how that helps. Definately a product worth trying (especially if you shower in the morning and can leave it on a long time) and at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I will continue to buy, good price good product, easy to use easy to dispense . wish it could be bought in stores</li>
    <li> Do you suffer from scalp eczema/psoriasis/severe scalp itch and flaking ? Of course you do. Why else would you be reading this review. Well, join me on an itch free adventure into scalp healing. Sit back, grab a coffee, without cream of course, and learn of the benefits of Doo Gro with me. Why do I say no cream in your coffee ? Well, dairy products will cause even more scalp plaques and flaking. Make no mistake about it. Also, you need to start taking a kelp supplement every single day. Removing dairy from your diet, and including kelp will help to keep your scalp in check. Ohhh, a rhyme, yes, I do it all the time. Okay, okay, in all seriousness, lets review this fantastic product called Doo Gro.  I must admit, I was hesitant to try another product. I have wasted a vast amount of money over the years trying various scalp products. I was tired of opening my wallet and having it scream at me. What, no way, another financial extraction ? You are pulling at me more than a farmer pulls at a cow&#x27;s utter !!!! See, again, no dairy for you. Get off that dairy, people. I have suffered from scalp eczema for years. I know many of you know exactly what I am talking about. Yes, the severe and constant yellow flaking and itching on the scalp that never stops. The flakes are not white, they are yellow. It itches and it burns. It is dry and oily all at the same time. When you are out in public, you sit in anticipation of the next scratch when no one is looking. During the time you scratch vigorously, you hope no one notices. Of course, the hottest girl in the room will notice you panning your scalp for gold just like a prospector of the California Gold Rush of 1848.   It is very stressful to live with constant scalp problems. You are playing the lead roll in your own budget 1980&#x27;s horror film. Unfortunately, the movie never ends. The main problem is, there is nothing budget about it at all. You have wasted so much money on scalp remedies that you could have now put a down payment ona new home with that money. People look at you like you are a diseased freak. It is embarassing, and you feel ashamed at times when out in public. I know this all too well, as I am sure you also do, my fellow sufferers. It is time to heal your scalp. Doo Gro Stimulating Growth Oil is the cure you have been waiting for.  I decided to purhcase Doo Gro a few weeks ago. I thought, well, if this product does not work, I will just give up on ever finding one that does. I have been using Doo Gro for 2 weeks now. I can now say that this product works as advertised. The first time I used it there was a difference. I found that the oil literally penetrated right into the scalp. The second time I used it, the improvement was even more pronounced. The itching and flaking decreased significantly. I have now used this product 7 times, and the itching and flaking has drastically reduced. Every single time I use this product, the scalp just keeps improving. You have to use Doo Gro if you suffer from scalp eczema or psoriasis. It will work for you. I apply it to my scalp every second day and leave it on overnight. I then wash it out in the morning. I no longer wake up at night like an egyptian mummy in a tomb scratching at my scalp after sleeping for 5000 years in dusty dryness.  I have tried every product one could imagine. Head and shoulders, selsun blue, T/Gel, T/Sal, herbal essences, fructis. You name it, I tried it. Finally, Doo Gro showed me the way. Why continue to walk around like an undead zombie when you don&#x27;t have to ? Nothing worked for me until I found Doo Gro. Like everyone who suffers, I was just sick and tired of wasting money on products that don&#x27;t do anything. Forget about using steroids on your scalp as well. They don&#x27;t work over the long term, and once you stop using them, your scalp problems will return worse than ever. I am not joking here, people. You will literally scratch yourself into a hairless stupor looking for relief. You must avoid scratching though.All this does is cause more sores, which will then result in more scalp flaking and itch.  If you suffer from itching, flaking, burning, dry, oily, bleeding scalp plaques, buy this product. I guarantee you will notice a major improvement within one week. Doo Gro is made from 100 percent natural ingredients. You can have peace of mind in knowing that this product is a sound choice for your overall scalp health. Also, if you suffer from scalp problems, get off dairy products. Again, I can not stress this fact enough. Peace and love, and take care.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 months and my hair has already grown 5 inches. It does leave a smell, but it is bearable. Your hair will be shiny and you will see results!   I&#x27;m going start using the mega thick oil, the shampoo, and conditioner and see how that works.</li>
    <li> I love this product as it smells good. This oil puts a shine to your hair and it also helps with the dry flaky scalp. This product does a lot for your hair and scalp. I do recommend this product. The cost and effectiveness is far more worth the 5 star rating here.</li>
    <li> I have used this product but I havent used it long enough to see an improvement so when I do I will post but this product is a not light but not thick oil it smells great</li>
    <li> This oil didnt do much for my thining hair line, but left my scalp dry.Perhaps it works better as a dip conditioning treatment.</li>
    <li> It does make the hair feel softer, it smells kind of good. However, it is very oily and it makes hair look dirty and gross. I tried using it as hot oil and it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel smooth, I still had to use a conditioner. Also, it doesn&#x27;t wash out easily. After I used it as hot oil, I washed my hair with shampoo...my hair still looked very greasy. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and my advice to you, don&#x27;t try it!&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner made my hair Hard as a brick!&lt;br /&gt;I threw it out in the trash</li>
    <li> Seems like a small amount but the oil definitely lasts a long time.  The oil can be used on the hair and it smells delicious and the bottle last a long time</li>
    <li> It worked  perfectly for my hair. Im definity getting some more.</li>
    <li> First, let me clarify that I did not buy this product on Amazon, I buy mine from the local Sally beauty supply store. I have been using it for years. Am African  our hair types take eternity to grow ). I stambled on this product after trying quite afew smelly oils that would leave stains on my pillow. This is a winner, by far. I use it on my scalp  just run the tip of the bottle all round your scalp ). Don&#x27;t devour your hair with it - hence the few comments about oily hair. My hair is now to the m,id back lenth! This is a miracle for a black lady! I love this stuff! Buy it, buy it, buy it!</li>
    <li> I do recommend this oil to any one who wants to loc moisture into their hair strands. I also did a YouTube video on my thoughts about this product. (Leenylynn) I use this oil for pre-pooing my hair before shampooing with a sulfate shampoo. I also use it during the L.O.C method, when I know I will be shampooing my hair that week. I have very thick 3c-4a-4b hair that needs special attention. Don&#x27;t use this oil if you are heavy handed or someone who doesn&#x27;t shampoo at least twice a month, it will cause build up. This oil is also an oil can break out your face if you over apply it. Overall, I really enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product to keep your hair nice and moist. It&#x27;s not too oily, and it still gives your hair a beautiful shine :)</li>
    <li> It made my hair grow and I wear a weave. I left the weave in for 3 months and used this product faithfully and when I took my hair down it grew more than before when I had a weave in the past and did not use it.</li>
    <li> this product does everything it says it will and also smells GREAT! works best on wet hair (for me). i use it afer washing my hair and it makes it so easy to comb out (since my hair, when air dried, is soooo unmanageable).</li>
    <li> Ok, I never write reviews but this product has moved me to words or typing at least.  I was randomly searching hair products and came across this and picked up a bottle at target.  I am a caucasian female in my mid 20s and my hair has gotten progressively thinner and does not grow very long (when it does grow long it is so thin that it is not very pretty).  I cannot give a review on this products ability to make hair grow but I did use it last night as a hot oil (I used a lot) and left it on my hair overnight and washed it out this morning.  My hair was infused with volume and looked like I put a root pump or something on it when I used no products at all.  I have heard that conditioning hair should revitalize it but have never experienced this until now.  The only complaint is that the oil got all over my pillow but that is my fault and can be remedied with a sleeping cap.  It smells great and my hair looks wonderful.  I am really anxious to see if this product does in fact make my hair grow.  I will be investing in more of the doo gro line.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Try it! Thanks.</li>
    <li> That is a great product it&#x27;s growing my husbands hair back</li>
    <li> The product is to moisturize more than anything else, I don&#x27;t know If it actually makes hair grow. But it nourishes and moisterizes your hair.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work no growth</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Took two washes to get the greedy feeling out.</li>
    <li> It works so good! I have been using this product for 2 months and my hair has grown! I dyed my hair 2 days before i started using the product in the pic you can seen how much my hair has grown. I also put a little on my eye browns before i go to sleep because my eye brows were a bit thin. Now they are thicker!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&amp;#34;ve been using it on my hair, and also on my eyebrows, to help them become thicker and fill in some thinning spots. It works. It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> this is good but was a little to gressy for me. I didn&#x27;t like it too much but its did keep my hair moisture and growing.</li>
    <li> Love this oil, one of my favorites</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle I haven&#x27;t seem any mayor growth on my hair still the same I wish it work cause I have very fine hair ;-(</li>
    <li> My hair is long and dry, I use this on the ends every time I wash it, it is helping it not to break.</li>
    <li> I was almost getting bald with thinning hair and loosing hair every day!. I started trying doogro and it worked like miracle. Amazing product at cheap price..</li>
    <li> Very good so far, but beware the bottle is very thin and if you&#x27;re clumsy like me it&#x27;ll break open. Advice-have a spare oil bottle on hand. Besides that it works well after two weeks of use I&#x27;ve noticed a significant amount of growth</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product at my local beauty supply and walmart for the past 6 months. I don&#x27;t necessarily care for the smell but I love the results makes your hair soft and manageable and have stimulated growth for my daughter and myself. I have relaxed short hair and hers is natural and mid back. I noticed about a 2 inch on her hair and mine.&lt;br /&gt;For the people who say it&#x27;s too oily you might be over doing the application. But good luck on your hair growth journey.</li>
    <li> This smells awesome and is really light. I noticed a bit of  hair growth. I am going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t do reviews product really changed my hair. The first day I got it I put it on my scalp and I slept with it on overnight. It did make my hair oily because I put a lot on. I took a shower the next day and my hair was so soft and silky. It was full of volume and I&#x27;ve never seen my hair as good as it looks now. Hopefully by the end of Febuary 2014... My hair grows maybe an inch or two.</li>
    <li> Came quick arrived on time, I love the doo grow products they work soooooooo good! Four star because I had to give the mail man a dollar because the weight of the package was off! Will buy again, maybe!</li>
    <li> I love how quick it came!! I did the hot oil directions and hair was so soft and shiny. Not too like oily looking. Love will but more!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my hair but I&#x27;ve only used it once or twice. It also makes my hair greasy so that sucks too/:</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It makes my hair softer and a bit shiner. Five stars</li>
    <li> I was trying to grow my hair longer so I could retire weaves and braids. I stumbled across this product and I thought I should give it a go. Well, the oil started doing its magic about 2 seconds after putting it in my hair. It has been 2 days and I am already seeing great results. My hair is shinier and healthier than it was before. And I have also found that my scalp is itch-free. I will definitely by this product again. :)</li>
    <li> I used it for 2 months, I like it, but I prefer Doo Gro Mega Thick Growth Oil, it smells better than Doo Gro Srimulating Growth Oil.</li>
    <li> Always grow atleast an inch more than I would have when I use continuously use for 3 months. Only product I recommend that works!</li>
    <li> I found a video on youtube promoting this product for scalp psoriasis.  After using it for about a week and a half, I have noticed a very significant reduction in flaky buildup on the scalp area covered by my hair.  The skin around my scalp that is affected (forehead, back of ears, back of neck) looks better, but is not clear.  Inside the ears is completely clear.  I use a pretty generous (maybe a tablespoon or so) amount at bedtime, and cover my head in a knit winter cap.  It keeps my head warm and protects the pillowcase.  It&#x27;s not very expensive; I would recommend anyone with scalp psoriasis to at least give it a try.  It doesn&#x27;t work immediately, but it seems to progressively improve.</li>
    <li> it is a nice oil solution but within the last four weeks i been using it, results aren&#x27;t very clear. I don&#x27;t think is working.</li>
    <li> This is a good  hair oil for dry scalp especially if you have skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little of this stuff goes a long way. The smell is pleasant. On days my hair is especially dry I use this stuff generously on my scalp before I shower and then use a little shampoo to wash it out. After I dry off I use just a tiny bit and rub it into my scalp. A little is all you need after showering. It will keep your scalp moist and healthy.</li>
    <li> Im half African American, half Puerto Rican and I have to say that it&#x27;s a great hair moisturizer. I like to use it as a hot oil treatment!! :-)</li>
    <li> Your hair would have to be as dry as the Sahara desert for this product to not give the appearance of extremely greasy hair!</li>
    <li> Good as a moisturizer, not sure as a hair grower, but we shall see. But it doesnt make my hair smell so nice. Oh, well thats life! Not gonna bash an ok product</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for a significant amount of time and it has done nothing for me at all. Apart from that, I understand it&#x27;s oil but it leaves my hair too oily to do anything with.</li>
    <li> Works fine on hair but it is just way too oily!</li>
    <li> My hair is softer my scalp isn&#x27;t itchy or flakey and it&#x27;s abnormally manageable!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle. Really. i bought this thinking it would clog my pores and i&#x27;d have more hair loss. I&#x27;m hispanic but after the very first night i left in my hair I was really surprised. Yes it does leave your hair a little oily, but soft. Usually when i wash my hair i get a huge ball of hair,then when brushing i get even more. After 1st night leaving in my hair i washed my hair and I didn&#x27;t get a ball of hair. I was so happy! I&#x27;m also using groganics which has My hair so much thicker and my scalp feels sooo clean. I recommend this to anyone who has been looking for a solutuin to thinning hair. YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY. Doo Gro works like no other I&#x27;ve tried and is very cheap.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil as I saw a web site that said it was great for Psoriasis on my hands.....&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice, greasy moisturizer ....but does nothing for my hands...&lt;br /&gt;As for it being a stimulating growth oil.....I don&#x27;t know,....&lt;br /&gt;Great review I know....</li>
    <li> IT DOES NOT WORK!IT DID NOT GROW MY HAIR,AND I AM VERY DIASAPPOINTED.I DIDN T NOTICE ANY CHANGE,AND I WILL NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE!</li>
    <li> Doo gro is the the best for shine and moisturizing your scalp. It has a nice pleasant aroma. If you have dry flaky scalp this is the remedy for that.&lt;br /&gt;It also made my hair really grow.&lt;br /&gt;Seller is wonderful. Product arrived on time and no damages to product&lt;br /&gt;Thanks! A+</li>
    <li> This is my go to oil, i have very thicke/course hair, my hair literally drinks this oil, yes the oil is thicke so it sticks and spreads out a lot, the nuzzle helps out, the oil wont run too much but oil if you squeeze the bottle</li>
    <li> I used this on my hair alone and as an additive to other products and I am now retaining my growth.  This helps me treat my hair like royalty.</li>
    <li> Am using it right  now still cant give a good review but i have heard alot about it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it was arrived on time</li>
    <li> I use this on my 2 grand girls hair I have seen growth in both their hair it smells good and is not greasy it leaves their hair shiny without weighing it down</li>
    <li> Ok wow, this product really works! My mom recommended it to me after she used it for about a month and noticed fuzz growing back where her hairline was previously receding. I took a risk (I&#x27;m always skeptical about products like this) and purchased it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a hair mask before I shower- letting it soak throughout my whole scalp (I put my hair in a bun) for at least 2 hours. Sometimes I even leave it in over night (after it&#x27;s dried up and won&#x27;t stain my pillow).Well, I have already noticed some baby hairs growing in the corners of my forehead (where I have been paranoid my hair is thinning). I will definitely be purchasing this again and would recommend it to a friend! It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but for thinning hair I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> First of let me just say that my roots smell amazing after I used the product. The consistency of the product holds really well and I like the container it was in. It arrived very quickly and the packaging was high quality. I can see that I have less split ends and my hair looks thick and healthy. I will continue using this product because I need to grow my hair. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I massage a tiny bit onto my scalp every night before bed and brush it out in the morning. My hair has grown 2 inches in the past two months when it normally grows about 4 inches a year (why you take so long to grow hair!!!) i love it my hair feels so smooth and soft. I even do a hot oil treatment every now and then. I am caucasian so my hair is naturally not that oily and my ends are really dry, this product is not too oily for me and keeps my ends looking smooth:)</li>
    <li> The product I received is exactly as pictured and taped nicely so the top stayed on securely.  I hope it is working however I have only been using for a couple of weeks.  It really helps moisturize your scalp.</li>
    <li> This item has mineral oil in it, which does not stimulate anything but leaves you shiny-looking.  I couldn&#x27;t finish this product as desired because it made my scalp looked like it had dandruff.  I had tried this because I had braids, and I felt that this item could help my scalp and hair.  It pours well but a little goes a long way. Be cautious when trying the item because you don&#x27;t want to waste your money.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me as a growth aid. I did not see and increase at all. A more affordable alternative it extra virgin olive oil applied to ends of hair to help retain length.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for like a year and something now and my hair was getting longer (a.k.a. growing at it&#x27;s normal rate of .5 inches a month)so that proves that it&#x27;s true to it&#x27;s name. HOWEVER, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair thicker like longer hair is supposed to be. Plus, you don&#x27;t want this stuff in your eye. It&#x27;s very runny and greasy. I found out the hard way and several ruined uniforms later that you only need a little bit for your entire head of hair, like applying heat protectant. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I just started using this growth oil to see if my bald spots can grow. And yeah it is pretty oily when you put it in your hair but thats normal do not freak out. If I start to see a different I will come back and leave another review.</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this product. I pour it into a spray bottle. I wear braids and this keeps my scalp from drying and itching.</li>
    <li> Love it makes my hair come to life and doesnt make my hair even helps with dry scalp I&#x27;ll marry this stuff if i could!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product but all products doesn&#x27;t work the same on everyone&#x27;s hair, so it didn&#x27;t work for me but it may work for you i don&#x27;t know but my hair use to shed when I used this product and I still continued to use and it kept breaking so I just threw it away...horrible im moving on to a different oil</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since i started my locs in 2009. This product WORKS...I couldn&#x27;t use this after a fresh retwist bc you could see the new growth coming in after 2-3 days. Fast foward to 2015, my locs are gone and i have texturizied hair. I still use it but i perfer to mixed mines with water in a spray bottle, only because i don&#x27;t like oily hair. The growth i received by using this product was crazy. This is one of my fav product to use, but i also used both their mega thick shampoo (blue tint) and the moisturizing one (white).</li>
    <li> Nice as an oil treatment, but too greasy for everyday use. My hair has not grown yet. I am on it for two months now</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I have a dry scalpan using this nightly with brushing keeps my hair healthy an strong. Paid @ $6 at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is extremely hard to wash out and leaves your hair dry because you need so much shampoo to wash it out. It smells good, but is not for my hair type. I have thin/medium hair, so maybe it works on thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I can really say this oil is working. My hair feels much softer and growing noticeably longer. I am very happy with this hair oil.</li>
    <li> my hair is really responding well to this product.  I would recommend it to my friends and family to purchase.</li>
    <li> My hair was always dry and flakey in the winter, but now that I use Doo Gro, it hasn&#x27;t been flakey.</li>
    <li> I am using it for my psoriasis but the half ounce bottle of Aramis I bought did not meet my expectations quality wise</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I had gotten it awhile ago (from sally&#x27;s). My hair has been thinning (stupid anemia &amp; stress)and it takes forever and a day to grow. Well I used this stuff for about 2 weeks and it made it so strong. I didn&#x27;t wake up like Rapunzel or anything, but there was a definite difference in the texture/strength of my hair. It just seemed a lot more healthy, which in turn helped it grow a little bit more (healthy hair grows more then damaged hair does, simple as that lol) We can&#x27;t take back all the years of flat irons, blow driers, chemical process&#x27;s, dying our hair etc. However, we can help to nourish it and give it a fighting chance. This product does that (p.s it&#x27;s even better in the winter because it helps fight dandruff that accumulates due to extra dry skin etc.) It&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve used it (and my hair has suffered) luckily I remembered the name of the product and I&#x27;m about to order a bottle right now &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s Their shampoo is really good too. However,I wouldn&#x27;t use it at the same time you use this stuff (use a more clarifying shampoo)because it can make it look \\&quot;slightly\\&quot; greasy.I remember the first time I did, I almost stopped using everything all together UNTIL I realized that I needed to use them separately. Do the \\&quot;stimulating growth treatment\\&quot; for about 2 weeks first, after the 2 weeks are over start washing your hair with the shampoo. I&#x27;m a firm believer in this product.</li>
    <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t grown from it but I haven&#x27;t been using it avidly. I use it to do it a hot oil deep conditioning treatment so it serves it&#x27;s purpose. I originally bought it for my daughter to grow her hair, I have not used it religiously so I will not say it doesn&#x27;t work. Hopefully I can update if I start to, but so far has seen no growth.</li>
    <li> does absolutely NOTHING. DO NOT GET IT.  Not worth a penny folks, do not bother.  bad product, horrible, do not order! amazon should take it off their site!</li>
    <li> Good product, Will leave scalp and hair oily! Be careful in how much you use!</li>
    <li> When you have extreme hair loss as I did, this is one of the better products to have on hand to assist in regrowing your hair back, I love it and it does not have a loud smell as some of the products do.</li>
    <li> My daughter had very short chlorine damaged hair.  We have been using this for a week and see a big difference.</li>
    <li> I have course, wavy hair. Many years ago I used VO5 hot oil treatments when conditioners weren&#x27;t cutting it. After rediscovering Vo5 and being disappointed with it (the cost [3.99 for two treatments] and the horrid smell), I decided to browse the ethnic haircare shelves. Low and behold I found Doo Gro and gave it a shot. I&#x27;ve used it for 4 weeks and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Seriously, this product will not disappoint if you USE IT CORRECTLY. Since there are no directions for Caucasian hair, I use like a typical hot oil treatment: apply liberally to scalp and hair, let set for 5 minutes. Wash and rinse THOROUGHLY 2 to 4 times (until almost all of the grease is out and hair has a \\&quot;conditioned\\&quot; feel). My scalp is naturally oily, so I give special attention to washing that area. Use this method every 2 to 3 washings. I no longer use conditioner - just a detangler on \\&quot;off\\&quot; days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding hair growth. That is partially true. It doesn&#x27;t make hair magically grow faster, but rather it keeps existing hair from breaking. They disclaim this on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks smooth and healthy. I can run a brush through it without snagging. My scalp is free from the itchy, flaky, tightness. It smells lovely. It&#x27;s made in the U.S. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Pleasant scent, absorbs quickly into my scalp, has kept my hair soft too!</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for already 2 years now and I find it helps to moist my psoriasis dried skin on my back, leg and elbow. Although the itches keeps coming back after several hours I find it does it&#x27;s job pretty well on that particular stage.</li>
    <li> YES...I&#x27;M HOLDING MY BREATH, WHILE WAITING TO SEE IF THIS HAIR OIL DOES WHAT IT PROMISES. HEARD THAT IT WAS&#x27; DA BOMB&#x27;  REGARDING HAIR GROWTH. SINCE I HAVE STARTED  ON MY HAIR JOURNEY, I&#x27;LL  NEED ALL THE HELP I CAN GET SOOOO.....I&#x27;LL CONTINUE TO BE PATIENT, WHILE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SUMMER MONTHS,...WHEN I CAN &#x27;THROW MY HAIR &#x27;BACK AND FORTH..&#x27;</li>
    <li> I am Dominican with very thin relaxed hair, my hair was constantly breaking and falling off, it never grows past my shoulders &amp; the dandruff was very annoying. I have tried so many expensive products to try to get my hair to grow. One day I bumped into this product at walmart &amp; decided to give it a try. That was the same day that I permed my hair, Ive been using it every day twice a day and in less than a month I noticed my roots were growing &amp; im in need of a perm again! I also noticed I have less dandruff than when I started using the oil so I am very happy with this. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with oily hair (obviously its an oil) But my hair was very dry, breaking off, growing very slowly but now i have some hope that I will finally have long hair. Love this, very affordable!</li>

    <li> I can&#x27;t say if this product has made my hair grow because I&#x27;m also using JBCO . but I have notice healthier hair . Only problem is that this oil makes my scalp itch intensely.</li>
    <li> I love this product It a lite oil that work well in natural hair. Since i wear my own hair I keep it in twist and this products I can use with my twist in right on the scalp and I can feel it work. All of doo grow products I have tried have been great and smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> Doo Gro is a fantastic product (not found in Canada) and is a Godsend to many people that use it outside the regular realm of hair care. As a sufferer of Psoriasis on both hands and not getting any relief through numerous prescriptions by medical practitioners,I took to the internet and found a home grown bit of information that has done absolute wonders for my well being and peace of mind.  With the application of Doo Gro, the cracking skin, the easing of the intense itching  along with the burning sensation that psoriasis brings, has been greatly diminished. Why it is not sold in Canada is beyond logical comprehension. Used along with a later application of deep penetrating, unscented hand cream, the Doo Gro Stimulating Growth Oil beats anything that prescriptions of any other medications have done. G. Hayes</li>
    <li> Excellent product, my daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> i have no idea if i am gaining or loosing hair, my wife said i look amazing after putting this oil on my scalp. she loves the way i smellllll</li>
    <li> I had very thin eyebrows and the hair wouldn&#x27;t grow. I previously used a pencil to color in my brows but now I don&#x27;t have to. I rub a tiny amount in my brows before bed. It took about a month before I saw noticeable results. Great results for a fantastic price!</li>
    <li> Restores the natural oils in you hair, and seems to help keep you hair healthy with very little effort.&lt;br /&gt;reasonably priced , too.</li>
    <li> Smells good really oily I used this 4 times haven&#x27;t seen the difference though</li>
    <li> It works. It works. It really really works. Bad weaving cause me to have hair lost I put this product on every other day and my hair is slowing coming back</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference within three uses on my roots smells good and works on white hair!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it</li>
    <li> As the creator of [[ASIN:B0073JL73A Miracle Hair Growth Oil]] I know a thing or two about growing black hair long. So I can tell you with some authority that Doo Gro Oil is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s what the oil does best: It gets rid of frizz and adds a ton of shine! And there is no need to glob it on, a few drops of this thick oil is all you need! This product is especially helpful for naturals,and those ladies transitioning from a relaxer.  You ladies know how hard those two textures can be to deal with; this oil makes both more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone wants shiny, frizz free hair, and this oil is definitely the way to go!</li>
    <li> I bought this oil after shaving off all my hair to go natural OMG..IF YA COULD SEE MY HAIR IT GREW\\&quot; my hair back plzz try for ya self its just real stuff</li>
    <li> Perfect for itchy scalp and also oiling hair a few days before you wash it and pull it back.</li>
    <li> I first used this one time about 2 months ago. I left it on most of the day, but my scalp itched the entire time. I didn&#x27;t notice any benefit from using it, and I sure wasn&#x27;t in a hurry to try it again.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward two months, and I applied it again yesterday after a shower. I&#x27;ve had it on all night as I&#x27;ve been on the computer and doing things around the house, and again my scalp has been itching like crazy. I&#x27;ve kept a towel handy to wipe my the oil off my fingers every time I scratch my scalp, and I&#x27;ve made many trips to the bathroom to get a comb to thoroughly scratch with. Ahhhhhh...relief (for a few seconds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it on about 10 hours now, and I&#x27;m heading in to wash it out. I&#x27;ll never use it again.</li>
    <li> Like a lot of other people here, I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon and never write reviews for products but stumbled on this page because I&#x27;m actually trying to find more of the stuff and thought \\&quot;why not\\&quot;?  I am caucasian with curly/wavy hair that has been dry and brittle in the last few years (I just turned 30 and think my body chemistry&#x27;s changing some - I also work outside year round and wear a hard hat at work so I think all the above had some effect).  I was having really dry scalp and breakage which led to damaged, increasingly tangled and out of control hair but found some of this stuff at a discount resale shop and bought a bottle for $2 thinking \\&quot;if this doesn&#x27;t do anything at least I only spent $2 on it.\\&quot;  Now here I am trying to find more on the internet because my hair hasn&#x27;t looked or felt this good in years and I&#x27;m not having nearly as much breakage, but don&#x27;t know where to find the product again.  Have to say I&#x27;m impressed, definitely have to be careful with the amount you use and I haven&#x27;t even used it overnight yet but I apply a bunch before washing and a tiny bit after, it keeps me from stripping the oils out of my hair in the shower and then seal it after.  Helps even more if you comb it through well under the warm water before shampooing.  The other thing I like about it is that the ingredients don&#x27;t consist of a lot of chemicals/alcohol derivatives, but things like henna extract, hops extract, wheat germ oil, horsetail plant, vitamin E, etc.  If you&#x27;re chemically sensitive or just not into super processed \\&quot;product\\&quot; that&#x27;s nice.  I do kind of wish it weren&#x27;t scented but at least the fragrance is a nice one, not super perfumey.</li>
    <li> Just started using this so I am not sure of the results just yet; I have long hair already and have been attempting to make it grow stronger so it won&#x27;t break so easily. It is a bit oily, as some have said, but it&#x27;s not too bad if you only use a little and you put your hair up or are spending time outside (I wouldn&#x27;t put it on after a shower before work though). It smells nice and feels good on my skin. I like to put it in at night when I am planning to take a shower in the morning, and sometimes I put a towel on my pillow to keep it from getting oily.</li>
    <li> It odes help my hair grow, maybe not as fast as some of the other ratings but it does help it grow faster. It has a stench but that doesnt bother me, its not that bad and I use it over night. Harder to wash out so be careful but as for the growing part I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This productions literally saved me from everyday pain on my face from psoriasis. I went to dermatologist s to figure out what was making me have breakouts every so many weeks. The doctors gave me all sorts of ointmints that didn&#x27;t work. Discovered this product and have been pain free ever since i started using it! THANK YOU DROO GRO FOR SAVING MY LIFE!!!</li>
    <li> Love the applicator and how easy it is to use and distribute the oil evenly throughout the hair.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t. Work for me</li>
    <li> Using this on top of my bald head each day I am growing new hair. I am very pleased with the price also!</li>
    <li> LAURA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT REALLY HELPS WITH THE GROWTH OF YOUR HAIR</li>
    <li> Works great it really helped the loss of hair and its a little cheaper then going to the store.</li>
    <li> I would use this product as an hot oil treatment, you don&#x27;t have to heat it up either. I&#x27;d use the Olive hair conditioner with it and a shower cap. Your hair will be left soft and manageable. It&#x27;s also good for braids, weaves and regular oil treatments.</li>
</ol>
