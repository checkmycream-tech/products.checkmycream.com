<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just got this 2 days ago. I was concerned that oscillating/vibrating wouldn&#x27;t be much of anything, and it&#x27;s more than I expected. I saw several people leave negative comments about the sponge applicators, so I wet mine first, so it wouldn&#x27;t absorb too much product. I&#x27;m using coconut oil, and that worked. The sponge applicator transfers the vibrations to your skin very well, and you can take it longer than the hard plastic massage applicator, so I used it on sore muscles too, on my ankle and wrist. It&#x27;s too soon to report results on my face, but I can report that the sore muscles are no longer sore. I&#x27;m using it with coconut oil, which I also massaged into my hands with the sponge applicator. So far the sponge applicator is my favorite and most used applicator, with the sensitive skin brush for my face next. The hard plastic massage applicator is better on fleshy areas, not so much on the forehead, but if you hover lightly, it&#x27;s good there too.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of research before I purchase a product that I will be using on my face, such as this facial cleaner. I decided on this one rather than one that costs more than three times as much because I could not find a reason that justified the extra money on this type of product. I also bought a sonic brush system over one that moves in a circular motion because I didn&#x27;t need any more pulling on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great, my skin feels so clean after I use it. I keep it in my shower because it really is totally waterproof. I use it daily with my regular cleanser and once a week I use it to exfoliate. I would recommend this product if you are on a budget but still want a sonic facial cleaning system.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Very premium!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 1.5 years now and I love it. I use it once a day before bedtime. It gets rid of every last bit of grime and make up and leaves the skin feeling really fresh. I bought this as an alternative to Clarisonic to try a sonic brush before splurging on it to see if a sonic brush would break me out. Well, it didn&#x27;t and I cannot imagine how I went without it before. The Sirius Sonic is still going strong and I have only changed the batteries once. I had put in half used batteries when I first got them and even those lasted for months.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these.  The reason I had to buy a new one is because after about the 20th time of dropping it, one of the tabs on the top part of the battery compartment case (handle) which clicks on to hold the handle to the head broke off.  Now the two pieces don&#x27;t fit together tight, and the batteries aren&#x27;t making good contact anymore.  For $40 I thought it was worth purchasing again.  I like that you can replace batteries anytime and that you don&#x27;t have to worry about charging it.  I use it everyday.  It makes a difference in my skin. Smoother skin, smaller pores, less acne.  It worked for two years before the plastic gave out on me.  I would give it 5 stars if the plastic was less brittle.</li>
    <li> The Sirius works as well - or better than the much more expensive Clairsonic that I received as a gift.</li>
    <li> Did not work very good. Was hoping it was something that was going to do a good job. Had it for 3 weeks and have seen no change.</li>
    <li> it dose clean the face better than hand, but its sensitive brush is harder than C brand&#x27;s normal one, and it does not circle, it just vibrates. The feeling is totally different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want to clear face, go for the C brand, I think this brush will cause many people break their face. Although the  massage head is a plus point for this thing.</li>
    <li> I honestly wanted to love this product, because I wanted a cheaper alternative to Clarisonic, but I hated it. First of all, I don&#x27;t have any skin issues, and just wanted all the blows and whistles it offers, such as toning, cleansing, massaging and better product absorption. My thoughts on it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, be aware that THE HEADS DO NOT ROTATE. Somehow, I missed it in the description. Should I have known that, I would never have bought it. You get tired after moving the brush on the your face yourself for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the other reviewer that the massaging head simply bumps on my skull, and this is not a pleasant feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other 2 brushes (toning and nurturing) are completely useless. They are sponges and will absorb tons of your product. My products are good quality and rather expensive. I don&#x27;t want to waste them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning the product and Amazon processed the refund promptly. Thank you, Amazon. I bought an even cheaper Olay Professional Cleansing System Pro-X instead and happy with it. It does only one function - cleanses, but it does it well and it ROTATES. That is all I need. When it dies one day, I will try Clarisonic. For exfoliation and better product absorption I bought a different product - Labelle Ultrasonic Skin Spatula. Love it.</li>
    <li> My face feels so soft after using! The price was great! I am a very happy lady now... Thank you Sirius Sonic Skin Care System.</li>
    <li> I like it very much. My skin is clear and clean. I don&#x27;t use it every day because it&#x27;s not as soft as I would like for that. However, exfoliating twice a week is enough for me.</li>
    <li> UPDATE again: Shortly after I wrote the last update, I tried it again. This time I pushed IN on the button as I slid it to the on position, and it started working. Hallelujah! I gave it more stars. :)  UPDATE: After 3 months it quit working. Not a good purchase, since there is no return after 30 days. So it only cost $34, but I got 3 months of use. Not happy. :( I downgraded my review from 5 stars to 1.  I just used this for the first time and am very happy with it. I can&#x27;t compare it to the much more expensive Clarisonic, because I have never used it, but my skin feels quite clean and smooth. I used the sensitive skin brush and will try the normal brush on my nose and chest.  That&#x27;s really about all I can say except it was well packaged and arrived quickly. For $35 and change, I think this is a bargain!  I will update this review after I&#x27;ve used it for a while and can better tell how well it works.</li>
    <li> This made me break out, which I normally don&#x27;t have a problem with.  Too harsh also for my skin.</li>
    <li> At $29.95 when it goes on sale this is a great price for facial cleanser system, and works very well, the same as others facial systems.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a mothers day gift for me fiancee, She uses it every day as well as gives me personal facials with it.  It was a GREAT investment for me, I mean Us, lol</li>
    <li> This is a sonic face brush. It does not spin. Things you should know before purchasing. I knew it didn&#x27;t spin but the sonic system is so good for your skin. It eliminates black heads, and removes dead skin. You have to move it in circles as well while your washing. It works amazingly and I appreciate the extra accessories.</li>
    <li> Kind of died out on me after a few months, was EXTREMELY disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love my Sonic!&lt;br /&gt;I got this as a gift a couple of weeks ago and now I can&#x27;t imagine starting my day without it. My skin feels so fresh and clean after every use. I&#x27;d give it 6 stars if I could. Fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;08:56  August 28, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Sonic for almost a year and like it a lot. I often travel and like the fact that it&#x27;s compact and doesn&#x27;t need to be recharged. It&#x27;s also waterproof which is a big plus. You can construct an entire skincare regimen with all the heads and attachments that are included - cleansing, hydration, exfoliation. Very good system and very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This thing is an awesome value!!! It works great and the attachments are very useful.  I could never justify spending $100+ on a facial brush and this one gets the job done for much cheaper.  It really makes my face feel nice and clean.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a facial brush on a budget.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t feel this is sonic at all - vibration with no movement of the brush doesn&#x27;t do much. I had high hopes for this and actually prefer my Olay cleansing brush over this.</li>
    <li> I though I was buying a brush with a spinning head.  What I got was a brush that vibrates.  That&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s mine for not reading the description closely.  It works OK, but I am not happy with this.  I will keep looking for a sonic brush with an oscillating head.</li>
    <li> Am pushing 50 and sometimes my skin really ticks me off...sensitive to climate changes (travel a lot), changes in humidity....who gets pimples at nearly 50 years old...really!?  Using this now for a couple weeks with a scrub from Neutrogena you can get anywhere has made a big difference...I notice my face is full of open pores...that&#x27;s new....no blemishes....</li>
    <li> I love this skincare system.  I did a lot of research before selecting this one over the Clarisonic or the Nutrasonic or even the Pretika.  It&#x27;s great, I can&#x27;t see how the more expensive models could be better than this.  I love that it&#x27;s battery powered and I don&#x27;t have to charge it.  I have had it for months now and still have not had to replace the batteries.  It has definitely improved my complexion.  I do favor the sensitive brush though, because the normal one seems like it breaks me out if I use it too regularly.</li>
    <li> Super product, great value. Every bit as good if not better than my daughter&#x27;s $250.00 Clarsonic. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t run as well on rechargeables either, drains them in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased 2 of these, one for myself and one for my son. Quality is just not par.&lt;br /&gt;With the price of new batteries and electricity used to keep rechargeables up it&#x27;s just as costly as Clairsonic and not even half as good.&lt;br /&gt;The sonic frequency is no where near the quality of Clairsonic, this is like those 5$ vibrating toothbrushes you buy for your kids.&lt;br /&gt;It works for now, but I am saving my pennies for something more affordable in the long run.</li>
    <li> Apparently I didn&#x27;t read well enough because I was assuming it was a spinning brush not just vibrations. but either way I love it! even after one use my skin looks better!</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  Price was very reasonable compared to others...This is my first sonic system..  I think it may be better than the oscillation brush type.</li>
    <li> Great product. Well-made, easy to use and much more affordable than others on the market. I&#x27;ve tested the more costly versions and they do the exact same thing. I love that it&#x27;s waterproof so you can use it in the shower. The attachments are really easy to put on and take off. It comes with a battery already installed. The only thing I wish it came with is its own carrying case. I keep mine in a make-up pouch.</li>
    <li> although I did not purchase mine from Amazon, I give this 4 huge stars.  I&#x27;d give it 5, but since I just got it, wanna see how it holds up.  I used to use a similar scrubber by Noxema, I think?  It had replaceable disposable pads, was not impressed.  This face cleaner is amazing.  I used it once with the normal skin brush, then used the nubby attachment to apply my lotion, my face felt deep cleaned and so smooth! And it has a refreshed glowing look. Even my husband said my face felt so soft, and looked brighter.  I like how it&#x27;s cordless and you can leave it out on the counter when not in use in it&#x27;s cradle.  I also have a home micro dermabrasion system that I use about every 3 months.  This is a great facial cleaner to have and use daily, does not seem to harsh for every day use.  If mine breaks, I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy another one.  I&#x27;m considering buying them for friends and family too.  It&#x27;s a nice little treatment to do at home.  Really can&#x27;t get over how much it \\&quot;polished\\&quot; my skin.  ****</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy one of the really expensive ones because this works perfectly. I had a drugstore version previously that was too rough on my sensitive skin. This is great because the whole device vibrates while you massage in circles on your skin, so you can control how fast and rough it is. My old one had a brush head that spun around on an axel and was too harsh. The cool brush heads it comes with all work really well. The directions are good too, because they helped me realize you&#x27;re only supposed to use this for 10 seconds on each part of your face. Overall, good purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought mine through a different site, and came here to get replacement brushes.  I am really impressed with this little dynamo.  It really gives a deep clean, and I love using it to put on my moisturizer.  I have super sensitive skin and I was worried about it being too harsh, but I was pleasantly surprised that it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.  Best skin care product I have bought for myself ever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many skin products and none of them ever seem to work for my skin! I thought I&#x27;d go ahead and give this one a shot also, but was expecting to see the same results as the other products I&#x27;ve tried, but no, this one works, and it works wonders!!!!!! I have never had such nice skin and I get so many compliments on my complexion after using this! I&#x27;ve spent so much money on all that other crap and this is so cheap and so perfect. It would also be such a wonderful gift for anyone, especially teens! What&#x27;s also so great about it is that it comes with multiple brushes for all skin types, whether you have sensitive skin or not, it works for everyone. Does a really great job cleaning and exfoliating and giving you a fresh look and feel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Clarisonic and can honestly say that the Sonic cleanses just as well. And while all the Clarisonic can do is cleanse, the Sonic has a bunch of other attachments, so I can basically do my entire regimen with it - cleansing, hydration, exfoliation, toning - the works. As others have mentioned - the sensitive brush is best for the face, while the normal brush is great for the body. Hydration and exfoliation applicators are identical, so it&#x27;s a good idea to mark them in order to make it easy to tell them apart.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift from my mother along with some glutathione soap to help with my acne scars and redness from when I was younger.  The brush itself is awesome... There are two for cleansing (one for sensitive skin and one for normal skin) and there are two other attachments that are made of foam.  One is for your moisturizer and the other is for your exfoliation product.  The other attachment is for toning.  I have used it already only 3 times and can already see a major difference in my complexion and the damage that has been done to my skin after suffering from severe cystic acne is minimizing each time.  I would highly recommend this product and have heard that there are really no major differences in the many brands available.  So why pay more?  This is a great product!  Battery operated is the only down-side.  It would be nice to be able to charge it like I do with my toothbrush, but hey, I can handle buying batteries for a product that works as well as this one.</li>
    <li> Have not had it long, but it seems to work as well as the higher priced brand.</li>
    <li> I use the Sonic every day in the morning and before going to bed. All it takes is one minute. You are supposed to use the Sonic for one minute twice a day for cleansing but I like to use it for extra 30 seconds or so to make sure my skin is extra clean. I use hydration applicators to apply my moisturizer and it works great. Just remember, that it&#x27;s a sonic device so just let it do all the work and don&#x27;t press the brush head into your skin.</li>
    <li> After reading up on several units (including the Clarisonic Mia) I decided to pick this when it went on sale. I have used it for about a month and I can say it has made a difference indeed. For the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the Sirius unit - I knew I got a fabulous clean and my face felt wonderful. I have extremely dry patches on my face and an oily T-zone, both conditions have evened out since use. Product gets absorbed better, your skin gets a good cleanse. It was definitely worth the money and I couldn&#x27;t care less that it isn&#x27;t the more expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use it everyday - there is no need for scrubbing out the top layer of skin that often. Once every couple of days, when I feel the dryness coming back on, does the trick.</li>
    <li> I looked for several days at the pricy clarisonic units but just hated to spend that much money.  After reading several reviews I decided on this unit and am so glad I did.  My face could not be cleaner no matter how much you pay, and it is glowing.  I&#x27;m not a youngster (66) so I want something that does what it is supposed to do and this unit does at less than half the price of the other pricey units.  I love it.</li>
    <li> No where in the description did it say that the brush/attachments don&#x27;t spin....just vibrate! What is that? I&#x27;ve had another brand years ago &amp; it spun. Worked wonderfully but this is not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Ok so I am an avid makeup wearer. I have tried the Clarisonic in Bloomingdales and was trying to look for a more cost effective option for right now just becasue I was not ready to 200 big ones on the Clarisonic. THIS IS NOTHING LIKE THE CLARISONIC, DO NOT BE FOOLED. This takes batteries which were simple enough to install. The brushes are easy to change out as well. But it doesn&#x27;t have an once of the power of the Clarisonic. The brushes barely feel like their moving against your face and you arent able to build up a lather like with the Clarisonic. I just received this in the mail yesterday and it will be going back today. Not at all worth the money. You do get what you pay for. (will be asking my hubby for a Clarisonic for my birthday!)</li>
    <li> After use for a full year, I can&#x27;t recommend this product.  The unit stopped working, so I contacted Siruis customer support one month after the one year warranty expired.  I was told, because I contacted them one month after the one year warranty expired, that I would not be eligible for a replacement and no alternative was offered. I&#x27;m out $50 and a working device!  And to think I initially bought this product to save money instead of buying the Clarisonic!  Enjoy yours while it lasts. They&#x27;re as cheap as they are for a reason (Made in China)!  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> The brush does not rotate</li>
    <li> Sirius sonic is a less expensive in my opinion better version of the popular more expensive clairisonic...the smaller brush heads fit better into the smaller areas of the face, around the nose where many get clogs pores, black heads, etc. The Sensitive heads are great for all skin types for facial use &amp; the regular heads for use on the rest of body, the pads work well for apply creams or moisturizer deep into your pores. Why spend the extra $$ ? It&#x27;s strictly for the name as I have owned both and this is a far superior product!!!</li>
    <li> Love this item!! Works just as well as the Clarisonic, but only a small fraction of the price. This brush makes my skin smooth and acne free.</li>
    <li> Gave as gift therefore unable to give rating.  In near future will ask the person I&lt;br /&gt;gave it to for her recommendation.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now. I use the sensitive brush because I don&#x27;t want to be too rough on my skin. I use Clearasil preventive pimple moisturizer and their facial cleanser. I use the moisturizer attachment every day after I take a shower because my face gets dry. About once or twice a week, I&#x27;ll use the sensitive brush to do a deep clean after taking a shower. My face feels great afterwards! I was nervous that this would make me break out badly. Thankfully, I still only get a few zits here and there. If anything, it makes my zits go away faster whenever I do get them! I mainly just wanted something that would give me a deeper clean because my face gets oily really easily. The fact that it helps get rid of zits more quickly than trying to pop them is awesome. This product is great and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this and loved it for about 6 months. Then it suddenly stopped working. I tried to replace the batteries and got nothing. It was still under warranty, so I contacted the company. I then proceeded to get the absolute slowest and worst customer service I have ever received. It took a few days for each response, I had to pay for the shipping to get it shipped back to them (which was around $12), and then I didn&#x27;t hear back from them for (at this point) two months. I still haven&#x27;t heard back from them, though I have emailed them to see if they received it since it was taking so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t buy their products. Go for it. I would just work under the assumption that if it breaks you are S.O.L. because they seem to suck at customer service.</li>
    <li> Its very good my wife like it .. its more than what she want.</li>
    <li> I sang the praises of this Sirius Sonic face brush when I first purchased it.  I called it better than Clarisonic because it was super effective, inexpensive, and the two AA batteries had lasted over a year with daily use.  I wanted to call it amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once those batteries finally died, though, so did my love for this product.  I replaced the batteries and found that the battery cover (the bottom plastic portion of the handle) kept slipping off.  I tried forcefully attaching the cover and letting the unit completely dry before attaching the cover, but every time I used the device the handle fell apart and batteries fell out in my tub mid-shower.  This was a huge let down, but because I loved the brush so much, I took a tiny dab of superglue and hoped that might solve the problem with the cover flying off.  Now the brush won&#x27;t run at all and the cover is stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve finally given up.  And sadly, I may have to convert to Clarisonic after all.  It was a good 1.5 year run with this super affordable and effective brush, but I can&#x27;t justify replacing it yearly and my disappointment won&#x27;t let me make a replacement purchase today. Bummer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for Christmas and she&#x27;s quite happy with it.  We think that it is comparable to a certain other sonic cleansing brush, which I have for myself.  If mine went out today I&#x27;d pick up the Sirius.  The massager head is a little odd and I don&#x27;t think she uses it but all in all this brush does what it says it will.</li>
    <li> This is very nice. Your skin feels smooth after every use. It also comes with an extra brush. I would recommend this highly.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the famous competitor, but I like how this one cleans my skin. It is waterproof so I can use it in the shower, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it not holding a battery charge like the famous one.</li>
    <li> I really love this product... Your skin feels so clean and fresh.... Haven&#x27;t really tried out the other heads yet but I will</li>
    <li> This has been favorably compared to the very expensive Clairsonic.  Although I havent used the Clairsonic, I am not sure how you could improve on this Sirius sonic.  It cleans well, and I have sensitive skin.  The applicators are my favorite, because they really work in the moisturizer.  Make sure to clean the application pads and finish that off with a bit of alcohol to disinfect and to promote drying.</li>
    <li> This worked better for me than the clarisonic did. This didn&#x27;t break me out when I used it and it came with so many brush options. My go to nightly beauty secret!</li>
    <li> bought one for these for me and one for my daughter seems to clean well and our skin is very smooth.thanks</li>
    <li> This is a great product for way less than the clarisonic.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a deep clean for their skin without irritation.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waist you money.  This unit STOPPED WORKING IN 2 MONTHS!!!!!  I guess you do get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> My face feels extra clean after using sonic skin care system. I have notice a difference in my skin and less breakouts! Highly recommend and very affordable.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and was as described.</li>
    <li> I just bought this and after using it for the first time I fell in love with it. No doubt this sonic is amazing. Have not used any other. Before buying I did quit a bit of research on other face brushes and this one just stood out to me the most. It does its job. Works great. Does not spin but that&#x27;s what I was after. I&#x27;d rather go my speed plus less breakage in future. If your looking for a good face brush the sirius sonic is amazing in my experience. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> Prior to buying the Sirius Sonic I read reviews comparing it to the Clarisonic.  I was planning to buy a Clarisonic, but began looking for other options when an inquiry to the company regarding animal testing indicated that Clarisonic cannot confirm that third party animal testing is never done with their products.  (Clarisonic also sells skincare products in addition to the Clarisonic cleansing tool.)  Sirius confirmed that there is no animal testing done with any of their products, including confirming no third party testing.  That alone was reassuring in making this purchase.  The price point is well worth mentioning  Sirius Sonic is around $50, and Clarisonic is easily over $100.  Sirius Sonic runs on batteries.  I have used my Sonic for at least four months now, generally once a day and have not changed the batteries once.  My aesthetician recommended I use a Clarisonic to achieve the skin results I was hoping for.  I bought the Sirius Sonic, and after using it for several days noticed my skin feeing much smoother and appearing clearer (I use the Eminence Organics line of skincare, also verified cruelty free).  When I returned to my aesthetician the next month, she commented immediately on the difference in my skin.  I told her I was using the Sirius Sonic, and she commented that it was definitely working!  With the continued use of the Sirius Sonic, I can say that my hopes have been more than fulfilled, and the financial savings is a plus!</li>
    <li> My wife bought this product and it was not as good as she was expecting.  You can get something similar for half the price at CVS, Target, etc.  Moreover, after two months of use, it stopped working for no reason.  Since they claimed the product has one year warranty she contacted them, but got no answer the first time.  The second time \\&quot;Heather\\&quot; email her and asked for the order number and home address to send the replacement.  Almost two months later and she is still waiting!  No one never emailed or answered her emails ever again.  She has no idea if the product was ever shipped.  Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> It just vibrates and does not go in a circular motion. The directions aren&#x27;t clear how it should clean the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to be honest, I really only use the sensitive skin brush. The normal brush is too rough for my face, so sometimes I use it on my body, &amp; I only use the sponge heads for when I exfoliate/moisturize, which doesn&#x27;t happen as often as it should. The toning attachment is weird &amp; confusing, so I don&#x27;t use it at all. Don&#x27;t let that fool you, though. This product is amazing. My skin is brighter &amp; cleaner than ever, &amp; I didn&#x27;t have to take out a small loan to be able to afford it, unlike other similar products. *ahem*</li>
    <li> Used once, felt too harsh on my skin.</li>
    <li> Just as good! Way cheaper! Only difference is you buy batteries... which is nice, less plugs being used! Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is supposed to be the cousin to the clarisonic. I have never used the clarisonic before but I have been using my sirius skin sonic for over 6 months now. I really only use the brush heads, never the heads for moisturizer or a face massage. It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. My only complaint is that I dropped it once in the shower and it broke open. It still seems to be working fine, but I am afraid that there is going to be water damage because the two parts don&#x27;t seem to be staying together completely. There is a little gap now that I have to constantly push together.</li>
    <li> really clears up your pours. try the soft brush first because the standard brush might be a bit harsh. affordable and works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my face, as well as my chest and back, and have been VERY satisfied with the results!!  I use the sensitive skin brush (white) for my face so it is not too harsh, and the normal skin brush (black) on my body.  It has worked wonders!!  The only caviat is that the normal brush can really dry out the skin if over used, but once I found the correct balance, it is pretty amazing, my skin glows and I get many less breakouts.  I do not use the moisturizing pads, so they&#x27;re kind of a waste, but for the money I can&#x27;t complain.  It takes batteries, but it doesn&#x27;t overly drain them; I use this product twice a day for about 5 mins each and the batteries will last about 2 months before I have to change them out.  Great product and value for the money.</li>
    <li> after much research and questioning, I decided to try this Sirius Sonic System.......WOW, it works great! I have sensitive skin and used as directed, leaves my skin soft and refreshed! I can&#x27;t see why the &#x27;other&#x27; brand is soooo expensive. So maybe it has 2 or more speeds, but I also read that they eventually die from being charged. This system uses batteries and I use it in the shower. I have even dropped it in the shower, the unit opened, I let it air dry, put fresh batteries in, and was good to go!&lt;br /&gt;I would never spend more than this on a skin care brush!&lt;br /&gt;Very Happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t terrible but you definitely get what you pay for. Looks and feel cheap. Vibrates but does not move if that makes sense. You have to make a circular motion with your hand. I&#x27;m going to splurge and get a Clarasonic which will do the work for me and give me better results.</li>
    <li> Not a month yet and it&#x27;s already broken...</li>
    <li> My skin was a little bit too sensitive for this, even while using the sensitive brush but after about a week or so, my skin did feel noticeably smoother. I only use it about 3 times a week as opposed to twice a day.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t do my homework when picking this one out. It still cleans well, but it&#x27;s a lot different than the brush I had before that had rotating bristles on it so I didn&#x27;t have to be the one doing all the cleaning. Having said that, this one was also a lot cheaper, so it&#x27;s fine for now.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent, it does a really good job cleaning my face, &amp; removing makeup. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> My face is so clean that when I get out of the bath tub, the cold air goes right into my newly open pores that were previously filled with oil and dirt. Love ittttt! And I&#x27;m a guy.</li>
    <li> brand new to me and used it twice so far - love love love it. easy to use and clean brush head. recommend body shop tea tree cleanser to keep it clean - naturally anti-bacterial and made for face.don&#x27;t. spend on the more expensive version. this is the one :)</li>
    <li> Got one for my girlfriend because she needed a new skin care system. She&#x27;s been having trouble with clear skin for awhile, so I thought it would be nice to give her a tiny upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She adores it. She hasn&#x27;t seen so much improvement in a very long time. She feels better, but also keeps talking about how smooth her face is. Kisses on the cheek make her giggle. It&#x27;s a nice sight to see a happy girlfriend, so I&#x27;m thankful for this product.</li>
    <li> My Wife loves this product. According to her there is no reason to spend $200.00 on the Clair sonic. The Sirius Sonic is a better product an at only 15% of the cost. Be warned no travel case though.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful, I&#x27;ve never tried the Clairsonic but read this was a great dupe for it and so much cheaper. My skin *knock on wood* has finally cleared up and is smooth and has fewer dry patches. I highly highly recommend this, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks and such quick results!</li>
    <li> This is was gift to my cousin and she love it</li>
    <li> Please take my post into consideration, I only used it once and it is pointless!  You mind as well get a cotton cloth and rub your face with your preferred face cleanser.  Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t move in a circular motion, you have to while it just vibrates.  I have toys that have a stronger vibrator than this!</li>
    <li> This cleans my skin and I love running the massage tool on my face to help the moisturizer skin in.  It also increase circulation giving my skin such a glow.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase the Sirius Sonic through a Groupon Goods deal.  It was a small investment with a potential for bigger return.  I&#x27;ve been using for the past 30 days and I really love this device!  I&#x27;m not person who wears makeup every day and I have sensitive skin so I use the device every other night.  The result is fab!  My skin is soft, smooth and polished.  I also noticed my moisturizer goes on smoother and takes less finger work to absorb into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the review by C.Gardner.  There are more parts than I require.  In fact the sensitive brush head is the only attachment I use consistently.  The normal brush felt too harsh for skin on my face but it&#x27;s perfect for skin on the body (like décolletage).  The toner head seems pointless.  Using it on my forehead was very uncomfortable.  It just bumped along my skull.  I don&#x27;t see the need to use an exfoliator because the brush provides enough exfoliation for my skin.  The moisturizer pad seemed to absorb more of my cream than my face.  But I did find using the moisturizer head after I rubbed in night cream with my fingers felt nice, a mini massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device truly is waterproof.  I&#x27;ve used it in the shower a few times.  No problems.  Just to make sure I don&#x27;t cause corrosion, I do dismantle the device after use, remove the batteries and let air dry.  One grip I have is the on/off switch.  When your hands are wet it is hard to thumb the switch.  Another grip I have is the cost of replacement heads and lack of availability at a local store (like Sephora).  I think $14 for two replacement heads is a bit steep.  However since I&#x27;m getting results I&#x27;ll be ordering two sensitive skin brush head replacements to keep on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I recommend the product, most especially as an affordable alternative to the Clarisonic.  I&#x27;ve never tried the Clarisonic but I feel really good about the Sirius Sonic and don&#x27;t see how spending another $150 will get me better results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping for.  Exfoliates and smoothes the skin.  Works great!!  Exactly as described. Very basic and easy to use.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I decided to save hundreds of dollars and purchase this face scrubber instead of the Clarisonic. The major difference is the Clarisonic is SLIGHTLY more powerful, but not enough to make a huge difference. The brushes and vibration from this product is enough to get the job done, and leaves you face feeling very smooth. I don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;hyrdation/scrubber\\&quot; pad and the face massager and think they are a waste. The hydration/scrubber is a glorified sponge. They tell you to apply your face lotion to it, but you have to apply more lotion than normal since it will absorb most of it. I prefer to save my $30 bottle of Clinic lotion and use my fingers to apply, rather than loose half the lotion into the sponge. As for the face massager, I don&#x27;t see how a face massage is necessary when cleaning my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this is a great product that I would recommend to anyone. It comes with more gadgets and extras than you really need. It is waterproof, which means I can use it in the shower. Overall, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Cheaper than its competitors, does a great job, has a nice stand, waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Extra parts are not necessary</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for a teenage girl. She loves it!</li>
    <li> GREAT product, and so much less expensive vs. Clarisonic.  Had a Sirius Sonic Cleanser for a couple of years.  Bought this one for my sister; she loves it too!!!  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush and I like it I don&#x27;t know is the pulsing is what removes the dirt and oil as much as the circular motion but it does work very well. I&#x27;ve had no issues with it at all. I do have issues with Sirius though.....I ordered two replacement brush heads and they showed delivered and I never got them. I contacted the post office and couldn&#x27;t get anywhere with them because their the post office and customer service isn&#x27;t there thing. I hit the contact seller button through Amazon twice to get in contact with Sirius to see if they could assist in finding the item. No response. So I finally hit the file a claim button and surprise surprise I got a message from Sirius. I know you would all think they then would be super helpful but no the message literally said \\&quot;this shows delivered. Contact USPS\\&quot; really helpful right. You would thing an only online seller would be more helpful so now I still need new brush heads. Amazon however immediately issued me a refund which I&#x27;m grateful for. Guess I should have saved my money for a clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******update. Someone from customer service did get in contact with me and they put in an inquiry with post office. They received a message back that they did not know where the package was. The rep apologized and promised to send me out new brushes and a second set of brushes. It&#x27;s been over a month....no new brushes and no answer to the follow up email I sent to customer service********</li>
    <li> I bought this because. I thought it rotated but all it does is vibrate a tiny bit. Guess ill use it as a shoe polisher</li>
    <li> Have 3 of these for our family, works great.</li>
    <li> My wife wnated this, when it arrived, she installed the batteries, it barely hummed, she instantly returned it. Sonic technology or not, it was a cheap item. She bought Spa Sonic instead.</li>
    <li> i cannot afford the mia. however i heard about the craze about what it does for you skin. using the sonic every day on top of my regular routine and NOT PICKING my face has definitely made a difference. would highly recommend as a cheaper dupe for the mia! i also enjoy the different heads for it and i like how you can purchase replaceable heads separately.</li>
    <li> I received this for Christmas and so far I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it.  I feel like it gets make face really clean and does a great job exfoliating.  My only warning is not to be over zealous.  I think once a day is probably more than enough with the normal brush, but I did it twice in one day and one of my cheeks feels like it is irritated.  The best way to describe the irritation is it is like I scrapped my cheek.  You can&#x27;t see the irritation but I can feel it.  It is my own fault.  Just wanted to warn others.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Sirius Sonic is a great product for a fraction of that expensive brand and does just as great a job too!  I love mine so much I purchased two more for gifts!</li>
    <li> I like this brush a lot. It does a nice job of exfoliating gently - I&#x27;ve stopped using regular scrubs because this is way better. However, I find even the sensitive brush a little rough on certain parts of my face. Overall, however, I&#x27;m really glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I wanted a product that would cleanse my skin, exfoliate it, and leave me with a nice glow. I&#x27;m quite young- so I wasn&#x27;t looking for something that would tone. But I wanted something really affordable. Hands down, this skin care system is the cheapest one I have found. But just because it&#x27;s affordable doesn&#x27;t mean it lacks quality. I was extremely pleased with the results. I have a bit of acne and wanted something that would clean t really well. This works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week I started to really feel the results. My acne was starting to disappear and because of the exfoliate setting my skin was SO smoothe! I was so happy. I had a really nice glow and it made me feel so awesome- even without make-up. My skin is so  pretty! It&#x27;s ridiculous. I had no idea what deep cleaning could do to my skin and I love the results. A lovely experiment. I highly recommend this set for teenage girls. For the price it makes a great gift and spa treatment for both mother and daughters.</li>
    <li> I have gone through two nutrasonics over the past three years.  This sonic tool works just as well and does a superb job of cleansing my face.  I like the fact that the brushes are easily changed and have a magnetic base.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it does a great job cleansing my skin.  The pulsating movement feels like a massage.  I don&#x27;t notice a difference in the texture of my skin as some other reviews indicated, but it does do the trick in the cleansing department. ;-]</li>
    <li> Ordered the Sonic for my girlfriend and she says it&#x27;s really great. She has been using it for a couple of weeks now and loves the results. Her complexion has definitely improved. I noticed that her skin became even-toned and glowing. In summary -- great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is sonic vibration, but it feels good and is easy to use and clean.  Haven&#x27;t had it long, but I think my skin will improve with more use.</li>
    <li> A must have product for everyone. Skin looks more refreshed in younger.</li>
    <li> Bought this and the ToiletTree one that rotates.  Both work great and have different features.  Gave this as a gift to my daughter-in-law.  She really likes using it.  She has fabulous skin, this will help her maintain it.  Going to buy another one for myself and another ToiletTree one for her.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels after i just cleaned, exfoliated and toned. This maybe the cheaper version but you still get great results</li>
    <li> This brush system works all right. My face was smoother and clearer using it. However, I do not like the exfoliating head. It developed an odd stench that I could not clean out with soap, vinegar, or baking soda. I soaked it and soaked it, and the odor never went away. So, I don&#x27;t use the exfoliating foam head. I use the sensitive brush for my face and the normal brush for my body, and they work well. I am still interested in a Clarisonic for my face because the brush actually oscillates, but this little system is economical and perfect for my body. I really do enjoy it for my body.</li>
    <li> This product is great...it&#x27;s light weight and the length of the handle is just right, easy to hold on...not awkward at all. The massage pressure is just perfect and my face feels clean and smooth. Also dimishes the pores which is what I wanted the scrub brush to do. I&#x27;m very happy in my investment.  Regards Sara</li>
    <li> I have always had bad skin, but with this magic wand, I immediately saw results.  This made my skin extremely dry the first week, but then my skin got used to it.  Do not take this in the shower.  It may work okay, but if you drop it, it won&#x27;t work at all.  It&#x27;s not worth the risk.  Oh yeah, and I used on a few new pimples and it dried them up within a day or two.</li>
    <li> I am a older woman with large pores and I always used a complexion brush that has been hard to find. I bought this and it does a tremendous job. My skin looks so much better after only a few days, my husband did know I bought this and remarked about how my skin looked, I refuse to wear makeup except for eye makeup,my skin is oily so I don&#x27;t use moisturizer but I will find a use for the other pads.</li>
    <li> Terrible not worth the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sirius Sonic Skin Care System religiously for 3 years since purchasing it with a Groupon. It does a great job with cleansing and exfoliating. I use it in combination with retin-a and ladies, let me tell you, this is THE BEST anti-aging/pore-reducing/skin-firming trick! I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s and wanted to get on the anti-aging bandwagon early.  I have noticed the small wrinkles in my forehead and around my eyes have declined.  Additionally, my pores have noticeably reduced in size!  I even had two large pores due to pimple scars and since using this regimen they are virtually unnoticeable.  I don&#x27;t know if this is more-so the retin-a or the retin-a in combo w/sirius.  However, the sirius does a wonderful job exfoliating the dead skills cells away after using retin-a (since it increases collagen regeneration).  And I can feel and see (based on the residue on the brush head) that it deeply cleanses! Try it ladies! (&amp; gents!)</li>
    <li> Great product. Works as well as Clarisonic, which costs hundreds of $.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> Works really well to scrub makeup and grime from your face. I was very impressed with its quality since the price is so much better than other brands. Your face with feel really clean and will tingle.</li>
    <li> i decided to purchase sirious facial brush to cleaned my face  when i got the brush it doesnt rotae it just slowly ibrates  its bad quality  and when i try to rturn it the seller charged me re tocking fees and shipping and handling charges so am very dissarisft wiht this purchase .  i will not recomend his to any body this is a sirious scam.</li>
    <li> First time I bought a cleaning device. I was not secure it works for me. I am 39 years old and I feel that my skin was very opaque. After first use I feel my skin fresh and clean, but I need to be careful in my chin, it was very red in both sides. After a week I felt my skin more shiny and my creams absorbed very fast on my skin . I think that my purchase was a good investment to my daily skin care.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Price was excellent value.  Deep cleans skin in just a few minutes.  Highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;This would be a great gift.</li>
    <li> After watching the segment for the Clarisonic on QVC I was so tempted to spend over $200 for a face cleansing machine but couldn&#x27;t get myself to do it lol. So I researched..and researched and read reviews and more reviews on the different brands available. For the price and what was included in this and the good reviews it had I chose this one, the Sirius.  I love it. It is lightweight, quiet, and easy to use.  It is a very soft vibration and I thought how could this do much but my skin felt much better after the first use. I do not have acne or breakouts but I wanted to make the pores on my nose smaller and I have red blotchy spots at times and very dry skin.  After a couple of uses my pores and overall skin tone looked better. I know this will sound far fetched but I have a scar from an accident on my forehead and as I&#x27;ve aged the skin on this area sort of sags a little due to the type of plastic surgery I had on it.  It is hard to describe but I swear it has made my scar look better. It seems flatter or more smooth or something.  I haven&#x27;t felt good this week due to neck pain and skipped my nightly routine a few nights and now my face has another blotchy red breakout which I did not get when I was routinely using this nightly or every other night. I used the attachment for the moisturizer and that felt nice to use. I intend to take it in a bath and use the normal brush on my body but haven&#x27;t yet.  I highly recommend this. I&#x27;m sure the Clarisonic is a great product, but for a fraction of it&#x27;s cost, I believe I got similar or maybe even the same results.</li>
    <li> The normal brush is to harsh.  The only feature I find useful is the softer brush.</li>
    <li> So I got this because I didn&#x27;t want to splurge on a clarisonic. My skin type is basically combination but I&#x27;m olive skinned so I have large pores on my nose and cheeks and forehead. I don&#x27;t get a lot of breakouts except when I wash my face with regular sulfate cleansers. So for years I have basically just used oil cleansers a few times a week. The results are very few breakouts but large pores and blackheads. (I don&#x27;t count blackheads as breakouts because they are pretty much always there)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that a cleansing brush can make your pores appear smaller. But I decided that since I hardly wash my face as it is because it makes me break out, I&#x27;d buy this to see what the results were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used this with an oil cleanser for a few weeks. My face just felt softer and cleaner and with the oil cleanser I wasn&#x27;t breaking out too much more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it so much that I bought a clarisonic. I know that doesn&#x27;t make too much sense but if this one made me break out or I didn&#x27;t like it then I figured the same would go for the heavy duty one. I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference in my skin in the few weeks I&#x27;ve been using a clarisonic as opposed to this model. The only real difference is that the clarisonic is much better made and has stiffer shorter bristles. The difference may be that I&#x27;m still using the brush the clarisonic came with which is the sensitive and on the soni i was using the normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither item has gotten rid of blackheads completely. But the difference is with the clarisonic you can customize the brush heads to specifically get to your skin type. So I think once I get a deep pore brush for clarisonic it will get rid of my blackheads.(hopefully)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the brushes basically do the same thing except they are miles apart on price. It&#x27;s hard to imagine because the clarisonic brush moves so fast and just feels like a much better brush. But I honestly have not seen any intense results from the clarisonicversus the soni.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have any major problems with your skin and you&#x27;re just looking for something to exfoliate and clean then this brush is probably sufficient. If you have specific needs then you probably should get the clarisonic. they have a brush specifically for acne, large pores, aging skin, etc.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Helping mt rosacea</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over 2 months and I do not notice any difference in my skin&#x27;s tone, texture, dryness, or acne. I still get a little bit of occasional acne, and my skin does not look any different from when I started. I was definitely disappointed as many have raved about how great this is and how it&#x27;s a dupe for the Clarisonic. I don&#x27;t have a Clarisonic since it&#x27;s so expensive so I can&#x27;t really compare. But, this brush does exfoliate your face and gives you a deeper cleaning. My skin does feel a little softer after immediately using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use this about once every other day. It&#x27;s good for getting off excess make-up. I would remove my make-up before using the brush. Once a week I use anti-bacterial soap on the head to clean it. I feel like using it twice a day is too much exfoliation. You do not need to press hard with this brush, just move it around your face in a circular motion. The first time I used it I pressed too hard and my skin was red and irritated, so don&#x27;t do that! Overall, it&#x27;s a good cleaning brush...but it didn&#x27;t really radically change my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for a gift. My daughter wanted one similar she had seen at a department store. Found this Sirius Sonic Skin Care System through amazon at a much better price. She loves it! Well worth the time and effort searching for it.</li>
    <li> This definitely doesn&#x27;t compare to the Clarisonic, but its a decent alternative to that one. It cleans your skin and leaves it feeling fresh. I get better results with Clarisonic as I find that I still get break outs and have gnarly pimples once in a while. Other than that, this is an okay product</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer, I got my Skin Sonic through a Groupon Goods Deal... I figured for twenty bucks, even if it didn&#x27;t work well on my skin, I could at least use it to scrub the algae off the sides of my aquarium :P.  But after using it for about 5 months now I can say that I&#x27;m really happy with my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before, I considered my skin pretty average, maybe worse than average since I always seemed to have a pimple or two, and lots of dry areas.  I started out using the sensitive brush head, but then switched over to the regular one once my face got used to the feeling (that took about a week).  I think the regular brush head exfoliates a little better.  After the first month of using the Skin Sonic, it effectively got rid of all the dead skin and my face absorbed my moisturizer much better. After about 3 months my acne finally seemed to go away and I have only had very very minor blemishes since then, although it hasn&#x27;t been that long so I&#x27;m still waiting to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-got rid of my dry skin patches&lt;br /&gt;-skin is super soft and smooth now!&lt;br /&gt;-no more pimples, except for occasionally a tiny one&lt;br /&gt;-no more blackheads&lt;br /&gt;-inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-AA battery operated (some might see this as a PRO, however)&lt;br /&gt;-replacement brush heads only available at a few places online&lt;br /&gt;-design of the handle and the on/off switch is not the best...I have to be careful not to let it slip out of my hands and sometimes it takes me a few tries to move the switch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve never owned a Clarisonic so I can&#x27;t compare the two, but for what I paid for this one, it is definitely doing everything I expected it to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I use this 2-3 times a week with just a drugstore brand cream cleanser with salicylic acid (like the Neutrogena pink grapefruit one), nothing fancy.  I only use the regular brush now and haven&#x27;t tried the other extra ones since a lot of reviews said they&#x27;re pretty useless.  I also rarely wear makeup since now my skin looks pretty good without any!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about a year now and am happy to report that my skin is better than ever.  I also have yet to change the batteries, surprisingly.  I&#x27;ve started using a grapeseed/argan oil blend to moisturize my face right after washing with the Skinsonic (my skin seems to absorb it better than the Aveeno lotion I was using) and this combo has been doing wonders for my skin - smaller pores, no dry flaky areas, and a healthy glow without being greasy. I always prefer to invest in products that make my actual skin better instead of covering up what&#x27;s wrong with it, so this Skinsonic brush has been perfect for that!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She uses it daily and were amazed by the results.</li>
    <li> I got the Sonic as a Christmas gift and it&#x27;s awesome! I never realized how much stuff still remains even after using makeup remover wipes. It comes with sensitive and normal brushes. The sensitive brush is obviously softer so I would recommend it for the face, while the normal brush is better for the body. Hydration and exfoliation applicators are great - do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to. Haven&#x27;t tried the toning attachment yet.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and many different brush options. Leaves my face squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> I bought the wrong one for a gift  Can I return it without the packing Slip</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of issues with dry skin and sagging skin in my stress areas all around my face. I needed a product that could help at least lighten them, as I get older the issue just seem to get worse. I ordered the Sonic and was really happy with the results. I have been using it for quite some time now and I was so happy with how much younger I look and how my embarrassing characteristics on my face are subsiding much quicker than I expected. The Sonic really has been working for me and I am excited to see the rest of the results over time.</li>
    <li> This product is great, especially for my sensitive skin. My face has never looked better! I have been recommending this product to friends.</li>
    <li> i like it but i wish it moved like the olay, but alot of attachments but better more than less</li>
    <li> This seems to work very well, I changed from an exfoliating cleaner to this due to a pretty severe skin sensitivity. This does not irritate my skin at all and leaves my face glowing ( even at 59)</li>
    <li> I bought mine from groupon. Good product for the amount I paid. I don&#x27;t use all of the attachments, I use the sensitive brush about 3 or4 times a week with my normal face wash. I would recommend this product, it&#x27;s easy to use and store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned an expensive Clarisonic so I have nothing to compare it to but it cleans my face well and I like all the attachments to exfoliate and moisturize.</li>
    <li> It vibrates on your face...no big deal i guess the microsonic would have been a better product i don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> It may not be the really expensive one (I have never used the expensive one) but I personally love the way this makes my face look and feel! I use the foam pads with avocado and the softer brush with a natural soap.  My skin looks so much better then just using the old wash cloth!  I It also give a great massage to increase blood flow to the face which helps with so many things like bags under the eyes and such. This was a great gift I love it!</li>
    <li> The Sonic has a number of attachments so it can do a lot of things - hydration, exfoliation, massage. But it really excels at cleansing. It gets deep into pores to get rid of all the oil and dirt. It&#x27;s great at preventing pimples and breakouts because clean pores is the biggest factor in breakout prevention.</li>
    <li> I bought this for gentle dermabrasion for my aging (65-year-old) skin.  The gentle head works well for me.  I can&#x27;t imagine what the difference between this product and the vastly more expensive versions might be.  The only downside is that one should change the heads regularly, and replacements are challenging to find.  Here again, though, the cost is much lower than for higher-end products.</li>
    <li> It uses conventional batteries so can easily be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a dock.&lt;br /&gt;Will see how long it will last with extensive usage. Give a 5 stars rating for now.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these products and was not what I was expecting them to be.</li>
    <li> I was originally looking to buy a clarisonic, but you can&#x27;t beat $35.00 for a brush that claims to do the same thing.  I love the brush, and I love how my moisturizer doesn&#x27;t sit on my face anymore, it really seems to get absorbed a lot better after using the brush.  I&#x27;ve been trying to ease into it, as I&#x27;ve heard people sometimes take time to get used to using these sonic brushes, and my skin seems to really like it!</li>
    <li> Although this is a good product, I expected the head to rotate.  This just vibrates.  It does an ok job.  For the money, this is probably a pretty good item.</li>
    <li> Just arrived yesterday so I decided to use this thing before bed. I read the instruction pamphlet which tells you how to use the handle and each of the brushes. Also mentions how often to replace each brush head which I though was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began my facial cleansing regimen the way I usually do without a brush. The &#x27;Normal&#x27; brush head (with black ring in the center) was the one I chose to use first to exfoliate my face. I wet my face, wet my brush and then applied my scrub to the brush moving it in circular motions from the forehead to the nose to cheeks, and then the chin. I followed up with the &#x27;Sensitive&#x27; brush (all white bristles) to use my cleanser, then &#x27;Toning&#x27; (massage ball) head. After patting my face dry I used a liquid toner water on my face, my spot treatment gel, and then used the &#x27;Hydration/Exfoliation&#x27; (sponge-like) applicator to apply my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Normal brush feels really rough. I would probably use this on my face no more than once a week. Maybe even less than that. I noticed a bit of redness on the areas where I may have used this brush for too long. Areas like my chin, temples, and around my eyebrows where I tend to get small whiteheads most often. It also takes quite a bit of moisturizer on the &#x27;Hydration&#x27; applicator your first use to feel like your face is really moisturized. The sponge kind of sucks in most of it so use a lot of moisturizer the first time you use this applicator to moisturize. Should only need a normal amount of it after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Although there is redness in these areas, I also notice way less whiteheads and a reduction in the size of the few larger blemishes I have. The larger ones are almost completely gone. So this makes using the &#x27;Normal&#x27; brush head worth the bit of redness that follows. My face also has more of a glow to it then it does when I cleanse it with just my hands. I&#x27;ll be using the &#x27;Sensitive&#x27; brush, &#x27;Toning&#x27; head, and &#x27;Hydration&#x27; applicator on an everydaybasis since they&#x27;re gentler. I&#x27;ll only use the &#x27;Normal&#x27; brush head once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a much cheaper alternative to the Clarisonic, I love that this comes with multiple brush heads and that the whole brush vibrates as you wash. Congested pores will feel squeaky clean. Replacement brush heads and applicators are also really affordable on the Sirius website and even cheaper on Amazon.com. I recommend getting some rechargeable AA Batteries if you&#x27;re worried about going broke to replace batteries. This thing is also waterproof so it&#x27;s safe to use in your shower. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy that I didn&#x27;t spend $100+ dollars on a Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I liked the actual performance of the product.  It was gentle on my skin and really helped keep my skin&#x27;s texture even and bright.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not very durable.  I&#x27;ve dropped it in the shower twice, and now it no longer works.</li>
    <li> Be sure to check your products as soon as they arrive.  I bought a Sirius Sonic Skin Care System for $40.00, but didn&#x27;t open it right away.  I just opened the product and it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I should have checked it out when it arrived but it didn&#x27;t occur that it wouldn&#x27;t work.  It takes batteries, it does not have a charger, and when I put in the batteries, nothing.  I bought new batteries, but still no power.  They refused to replace the item when I contacted them.  I asked them for a replacement, not a refund.  I know time has passed, but I don&#x27;t do business with any companies that don&#x27;t stand by their products.  Buyer Beware...Be wise, open it right away, and return it right away, as you will end up like me, stuck with a $40.00 paper weight.</li>
    <li> Pretty decent product for the price, I&#x27;ve had noticeable results and am pleased</li>
    <li> What a great compliment to my skincare regime.  I like both brushes and the massager (feels great around my sinuses and temples); but, like other reviews I find the pads just suck up the product (I wetted them first).  Both brushes leave my skin super clean, and I use the massager for the moisturizer.  There has been a noticeable difference on the visual appearance of my skin, and the use of the massager has greatly reduced the puffiness below my eyes when nothing else did.</li>
    <li> As my skin has aged I became increasingly aware of permanent dry spots on my cheeks and forehead, leaving me with flaky spots that no foundation could cover, and no method of cleansing would cure--until now. I also have deep wrinkles near my mouth due to improperly fitted dentures. I have used this product every day since it arrived and I absolutely cannot believe the improvement in my skin. My dry spots are nearly gone, and the wrinkles have noticeably decreased. The brush is very soft. A very small amount of cleanser is all that is needed. I have already received my refill, in a larger size. A plastic cover comes with the kit that protects the brush from smashing--a great travel feature. The charger just latches right on to the handle of the cleaner with a magnet. The instruction booklet indicates a light on the unit for charging. Mine does not have this light. I purchased the Turquoise model. Your face will thank you!</li>
    <li> There should be more clarification on the advertising to this product.&lt;br /&gt;The hand held device does not rotate, it only vibrates so you must do the work yourself for your facial cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Disapointed.</li>
    <li> DEFINITELY GET THIS PRODUCT. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. I NOTICE A DIFFERENCE ON MY SKIN WITHIN DAYS!!!&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S VERY EASY TO USE. YOU CAN&#x27;T BEAT THE PRICE. YOU WILL LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> works well, skin feels very clean after use.</li>
    <li> I liked this product so much that I bought another for my daughter.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s cordless, and that it cleans my face so much better than I had been without it.  There is a noticeable difference.  I&#x27;m very happy with its performance.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely useless. It has a useless and weak vibrator that just vibrates your hand and wastes battery.</li>
    <li> Really good product. Matches me expectations</li>
    <li> This product advertises a sonic cleansing system and it got great reviews from others, but I am totally stumped as to why.  The system seems well made and the directions are thorough. BUT, I was more than surprised, shocked even, to discover that there is no rotation/oscillation/movement of any kind in the brush heads or other attachments.  This is basically a face brush that you rotate entirely yourself, with a battery vibrating intensely in the handle. I can&#x27;t even return this because I&#x27;ve had it too long.  I was waiting to use the Sirius until my Olay Pro-X  wore out. BIG MISTAKE....the Olay Pro-X at least rotates and gives a deeper clean than just a brush alone and the battery vibration in your hand isn&#x27;t intense/unpleasant.  I definitely feel ripped off.</li>
    <li> I have a MIA 2, and my sister wants to have one. Therefore, I order this to see can it be a dupe for my Clarisonic brush, and it is totally not the one. It just lightly vibrates, and the brush head does not have the rotation part like the Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The normal brush head is way too harsh for any skin type, you should use it on the body only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, Sirius Sonic is a cheaper and  significantly weaker system compare to Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, NO HIGH EXPECTATION.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product at first but in a nutshell, it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my girlfriend the clearsonic and ended up using it pretty often and wanted my own but didn&#x27;t really want to spend that much on myself as I don&#x27;t care as much as she does for her skin.  I did some research and read rave reviews about the Sirius sonic skin care system.  At first I though to myself, how can a $40 product claim to do the same as the clearsonic which is $200+??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bit the bullet seeing that it was so cheap and have been using it for the past while and am pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I feel that the Sirius is NOT a clearsonic killer.  Yes, it is cheaper and it works but you obviously get what you pay for.  The primary difference is the clearsonic has an inner ring that vibrates/circular rotations which the outer ring vibrates or does whatever the hell it does.  I do feel more \\&quot;clean\\&quot; when I use the clearsonic but does that extra feeling of clean justify the almost 4x price difference?  Probably not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearsonic IS better.  Some features are: the added inner ring thing, charging stand/no need for batteries/ better quality product.  But these things obviously come at a price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sirius is the Toyota camry equivalent of face cleansers (probably others out there that do the same thing) where the clearsonic is the BMW of face cleansers.  Yes, I know there is the debate of BMWs being inferior to Toyotas but this is for comparisons sake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, if you have the money, go for Clearsonic.  If you don&#x27;t, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed with Sirius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy face cleaning.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly. I thought it did not work and was going to return it. Sirius actually called me to explain how to put the batteries in the handle. (And yes, I felt stupid). Very pleasant massage feeling with the sensitive brush. I will post again in 3 months to report on skin changes.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool.  I actually feel like it&#x27;s ironing out wrinkles!!!  I use it faithfully 2x per week and there is a visible difference.  Two of my friends also have bought one since they saw how it works.  I&#x27;m over 60 so I can assure you that ironing deep and fine wrinkles is a challenge!!</li>
