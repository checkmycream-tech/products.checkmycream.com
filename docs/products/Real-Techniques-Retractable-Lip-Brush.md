      <li>The perfect lip brush!</li>
      <li>Excellent lip brush!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect idea</li>
      <li>Maybe, it depends if you want a retractable brush or just a lip brush, and it is a very good thing that it has a cap.</li>
      <li>So it came on time, looks just like the picture, and it is very good.</li>
      <li>Beautiful quality brush</li>
      <li>Lip brush is just great.</li>
      <li>Good product for the price.</li>
      <li>, I have had some that were 5 times the amount and not as good.</li>
      <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a good lip brush, I like to use it with LA Girl lip paints.</li>
      <li>Not mind blowing, could probably go to a cheaper brand it just be as good.</li>
      <li>it was a gift, and the receiver loved it.</li>
      <li>Good quality packaging</li>
      <li>This is actually a good brush for the lips besides the retractable issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And to have bristles on the brush of exceptional design.</li>
      <li>Love thia brush!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>so I can order more!</li>
      <li>It retracts nicely to keep the brush away from germs.</li>
      <li>liked the look and feel of the piece though.</li>
      <li>nice brush but</li>
      <li>Love this lip brush, actually, I love all my lip brushes!</li>
      <li>great brush, well worth the money</li>
      <li>To the best of soft, well-gaining lipstick gives it.</li>
      <li>Very precise.</li>
      <li>Can get very detailed with you lips.</li>
      <li>Love that it has a cap.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Looks so cute, I want to love it</li>
      <li>so it is better suited to dense lipstick formulas, but you can make it work.</li>
      <li>This is ok</li>
      <li>This one has a great brush- holds up very well.  </li>
      <li>Love the color too.</li>
      <li>So I thought Ok, this can&#x27;t be how it is &amp;#34;retractable&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve used better.</li>
      <li>love this item.</li>
      <li>I will purchase a non retractable brush and hope for better results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using it to finish out a tube of my favorite lipstick</li>
      <li>I love that this is retractable, so that it&#x27;s easy to travel with, I also love the color.</li>
      <li>I use it mostly for lipstick or lip gloss that don&#x27;t glide on easily.</li>
      <li>The brush is shaped so that it&#x27;s easy to line and fill in the lips.  </li>
      <li>its great especially for the cost!</li>
      <li>I have tried a few lip brushes, and this was the best in my opinion (quality, attractiveness, portability, cost).</li>
      <li>Love Real Techniques!</li>
      <li>Love all the Real Techniques brushes.  </li>
      <li>not that super quality feeling I&#x27;m used to from the real techniques brushes, but an ok lip brush for on the go.</li>
      <li>The brush itself is fine, but nowhere near as great as Real Technique&#x27;s normal Lip Brush.</li>
      <li>Kind of too long for your purse and the cap cracked after a couple uses</li>
      <li>Being a real techniques lover and In need of a lip brush, I needed to buy this!</li>
      <li>While I love the real techniques brushes, especially for foundation makeup, this one isn&#x27;t a winner.  </li>
      <li>The bristles do not splay, they are soft on your lips, yet firm enough to create a perfectly defined pout.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the brush is perfect.. stiff enough to make clean lines but soft enough to blend</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Brush works very well.</li>
      <li>The brush itself is decent.</li>
      <li>Nice retractable lip brushes are hard to find.  </li>
      <li>I have just about all of the Real Techniques brushes and enjoy using them, stipple, blush, powder and small shadow brush.  </li>
      <li>it has a clear plastic cover and there is a metal cover that temporarily covers the brush, but</li>
      <li>It has a movable piece, but will not stay fixed to protect the brush when not in use.</li>
      <li>I carry this around to use with lip stains and anything that comes in a tube (like OCC lip tars) or is too drying to apply directly to my lips (like some matte lipsticks).</li>
      <li>but the bristle is cheaply made, too firm yet not apply lipstick evenly</li>
      <li>Only downside that the retractable piece is not 100% fixed it turns sometimes.</li>
      <li>The brush itself is soft and compact, so I like that, but the plastic material the handle and cap it made out of feels a little cheap compared to other brushes and especially compared to other real techniques brushes.</li>

<li> The brush tip is a little too sparse as well, making this less useful.  </li>
<li> If you grab it with your finger you can slide it up and down, but if it is up when you put the cap on, the cap slides it down and it is back to normal.</li>
<li> Pretty poor design for a travel item.</li>
<li> Not as expected.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s firm enough so that it doesn&#x27;t flatten when applying lip color.</li>
<li> This is not really retractable.</li>
<li> so not what i expected for the price.</li>
<li> Was exactly as expected</li>
<li> not exactly a retractable lip brush.  </li>
<li> Everything I expected it to be!</li>
<li> but that was probably due to user error.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s just you can&#x27;t get a clean/sharp enough line I find the bristle part is too thick</li>
<li> Very convenient for carrying and always keep the brush be away from other dirty things.</li>
<li> Not cool, not cool at all.</li>
<li> First of all, the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on at all which was very disappointing considering the only reason I purchased it was because it was for travel and had a cap.</li>
<li> The plastic lid that fits over it, is never secure, so it slips off all the time and there&#x27;s no way of making it stay.  </li>
<li> so I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
<li> Brush is very firm</li>
<li> The retractable portion performs clumsily, often staying in the extended position even with the lid on.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m only sad that I haven&#x27;t found this brush sooner!</li>
<li> ummmm, duh!  </li>
<li> Retractable lip bushes are very hard to find in the retail stores.</li>
<li> So needed for my thin, sad lips.</li>
<li> Been obsessed with using a brush to put on lipstick</li>
<li> absolutely stupid design.</li>
<li> But this one is just crap.  </li>

    <li> I like it. I use it mostly for lipstick or lip gloss that don&#x27;t glide on easily.</li>
    <li> its great especially for the cost!</li>
    <li> I have just about all of the Real Techniques brushes and enjoy using them, stipple, blush, powder and small shadow brush.  But this one is just crap.  The name implies it&#x27;s retractable, so you expect it to be compact and &#x27;shrink&#x27; in size when it retracts.  Nope, it doesn&#x27;t.  Actually nothing &#x27;retracts&#x27;.  The plastic lid that fits over it, is never secure, so it slips off all the time and there&#x27;s no way of making it stay.  So your lip brush which may have some product on it is a magnet for every piece of lint in your purse or cosmetic case.  Not cool, not cool at all.</li>
    <li> love this item. so not what i expected for the price.</li>
    <li> not exactly a retractable lip brush.  it has a clear plastic cover and there is a metal cover that temporarily covers the brush, but ummmm, duh!  it doesnt retract anywhere.  the cap still falls off in your purse and you end up with lipstick all over your makeup bag.  absolutely stupid design.</li>
    <li> Love that it has a cap.</li>
    <li> not that super quality feeling I&#x27;m used to from the real techniques brushes, but an ok lip brush for on the go.</li>

    <li> Love this lip brush, actually, I love all my lip brushes! So needed for my thin, sad lips.</li>
    <li> retractable brush keeps sliding back in case, also the lip got stuck a couple times. Otherwise, the brush is perfect.. stiff enough to make clean lines but soft enough to blend</li>
    <li> Very convenient for carrying and always keep the brush be away from other dirty things.</li>
    <li> Retractable lip bushes are very hard to find in the retail stores. And to have bristles on the brush of exceptional design.</li>
    <li> This is ok but I&#x27;ve used better. The cap doesn&#x27;t snap on well and I eventually lost it. I bought it for the cap so I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it to finish out a tube of my favorite lipstick and I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect idea but it&#x27;s just you can&#x27;t get a clean/sharp enough line I find the bristle part is too thick</li>

    <li> Not mind blowing, could probably go to a cheaper brand it just be as good. Kind of too long for your purse and the cap cracked after a couple uses but that was probably due to user error. Would probably repurchase elsewhere if it totally broke. Otherwise it&#x27;s a good lip brush, I like to use it with LA Girl lip paints.</li>
    <li> Love all the Real Techniques brushes.  Was exactly as expected</li>
    <li> Does what it needs to do.</li>
    <li> The perfect lip brush!

The bristles do not splay, they are soft on your lips, yet firm enough to create a perfectly defined pout. I&#x27;m only sad that I haven&#x27;t found this brush sooner! I wish they came in different colors so I can order more!</li>
    <li> Love thia brush! No sheading whatsoever. Very precise. The only con is that the cap keeps falling off.</li>
    <li> Not as expected.  It doesn&#x27;t retract...just kind&#x3D;of flops back into the wand.</li>
    <li> Can get very detailed with you lips. Been obsessed with using a brush to put on lipstick</li>
    <li> Everything I expected it to be! Love Real Techniques!</li>
    <li> While I love the real techniques brushes, especially for foundation makeup, this one isn&#x27;t a winner.  The retractable portion performs clumsily, often staying in the extended position even with the lid on.  The brush tip is a little too sparse as well, making this less useful.

    <li> Beautiful quality brush</li>
    <li> it was a gift, and the receiver loved it.</li>
    <li> Actually it is a briliant idea to have a retractable lip brush in your purse and so. Only downside that the retractable piece is not 100% fixed it turns sometimes.</li>
    <li> Lip brush is just great. To the best of soft, well-gaining lipstick gives it. Good quality packaging</li>
    <li> nice brush but the cap keeps coming off</li>
    <li> great brush, well worth the money, I have had some that were 5 times the amount and not as good.Buy it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Being a real techniques lover and In need of a lip brush, I needed to buy this! So it came on time, looks just like the picture, and it is very good. I take the brush out and put the cap on. So now I go to test the rectractableness (is that a word?) and I start to take off the cap, and an inner casing of the brush slides up around the tip. The cap comes off after pulling again and the brush has the casing around it still. If you grab it with your finger you can slide it up and down, but if it is up when you put the cap on, the cap slides it down and it is back to normal. So I thought Ok, this can&#x27;t be how it is &amp;#34;retractable&amp;#34;. To me retractable is when you turn something and the tip goes up out of the shell. I could find nothing else to identify this as retractable. The brush itself is soft and compact, so I like that, but the plastic material the handle and cap it made out of feels a little cheap compared to other brushes and especially compared to other real techniques brushes. This is actually a good brush for the lips besides the retractable issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this? Maybe, it depends if you want a retractable brush or just a lip brush, and it is a very good thing that it has a cap.</li>
    <li> This brush does not retract. I had to retract the tip of the brush manually each time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the look and feel of the piece though.</li>
    <li> Brush is very firm so it is better suited to dense lipstick formulas, but you can make it work. Good product for the price.</li>
