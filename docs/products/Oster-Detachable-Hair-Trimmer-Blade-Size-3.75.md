    <li> A great addition to the removable cutting head set for my Oster Classic 76 Hair Clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But where&#x27;s the bridge between the size 2 and 3 3/4?  I had to but a comb set to get a #3 for my 10 year old son&#x27;s favorite buzz cut length.  I&#x27;d toss the combs in a heartbeat if a size three clipper blade was available.</li>
    <li> New and on time!! Thanks! Will come in use for many years to come. Will do business with them again.</li>
    <li> I started using right away every day since always reliable. If I had to I&#x27;d order them with no worries</li>
    <li> Not the product I was expecting.  Blade quality leaves a lot to be desired.  Plastic comb attachments work better for this length.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s perfect for giving a great haircut to our son who serves in the military.  This will last us a long time.</li>

I guess I have paid the lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those just occasionally use the 3.75 size blade, it will be just fine.I really recommend spending a few more dollars to get the AgION one.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about getting this along with the classic 76 I got too.  I am glad I did.  I use it regularly and it works perfect.  The size is the equivalent of a #4 attachment which is what I use to do the sides of my head.  It&#x27;s great quality, much better than the plastic attachments and is very easy to take on/off.</li>
