      <li>I&#x27;ve been using retinol products for years and this one is by far the best.</li>

      <li>I was excited to try this, as my friend was raving about it!</li>
      <li>I use this in combination with CLNS lotion, and so far these two did great on my post-pregnancy skin.</li>
      <li>My skin looks clearer, smoother, and my fine lines are diminished.</li>
      <li>It does minimize dryness and irritation as more chemically oriented retinoids tend to produce, but the first two times I used this product, I had more blemishes the night after than I had had before.  </li>
      <li>I am amazed at how quickly this happened with just two or three night-time uses!</li>
      <li>Gentle but effective blend of ingredients.</li>
      <li>The emulsifying wax or sunflower seed oil (ingredients #2 and #3) might have blocked my pores, oil-based ingredients being not such a great choice for acne-prone skin.  </li>

      <li>This product is super affordable, and it truly works without overdrying my skin.</li>
      <li>I cut down usage from every night to twice a week so not as to overdo it, but yes, this is great.</li>

      <li>Within a week my skin became much clearer and softer.</li>
      <li>I like the smell of it, and it works really well for overnight clear-ups.</li>
      <li>This product works very well on my skin.</li>
      <li>I do have pretty sensitive skin, so I was happy to see this had all-natural ingredients, but in the end, I was not happy with it at all.</li>
      <li>It gently encouages the natural exfoliation of skin.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product based on the natural approach and its ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I have rosacea and this does not irritate my skin and keeps it very clear.</li>
      <li>far it&#x27;s all working great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Acne can have many causes and treatments, there is no universal soloution, but I would reccommend anyone with acne to at least try these products.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find any retinol products suited to my sensitive skin locally so decided to order through amazon.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product other than to help with the clarity of my skin.</li>
      <li>I have had acne for over ten years and tried a whole bunch of products, these products make a bigger difference than any other I have tried so far.</li>
      <li>I have seen real improvement in dark spots, and smoother skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was excited to try this, as my friend was raving about it! However, after just two or three days of use, I stopped using it, because it made my skin burn, especially around my eyes. I haven&#x27;t used it in several days, yet the skin around my eyes still feels like it&#x27;s on fire!! It also caused my face to peel and dry out. I am amazed at how quickly this happened with just two or three night-time uses! I do have pretty sensitive skin, so I was happy to see this had all-natural ingredients, but in the end, I was not happy with it at all. I&#x27;ll pass it on to my friend. :(</li>
    <li> I really love this product! I have only been using it for a couple of weeks, but it has cleared my acne and my skin is glowing! So many retin-A products are overwhelmingly expensive, and they just don&#x27;t work. This product is super affordable, and it truly works without overdrying my skin. Try it! You will not regret it!</li>
    <li> This product works very well on my skin. It leaves it smooth and even, and on top of that it has a pleasant smell (sunflower seeds?). One bottle last over two months with everyday use. I already bought another one! I use this in combination with CLNS lotion, and so far these two did great on my post-pregnancy skin. Thank you POM!</li>
    <li> This actually is working! My skin looks clearer, smoother, and my fine lines are diminished. No burning or peeling. Will def buy more.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is helping with my acne prone skin but I do know that in the 2 months since using it almost nightly, it has definitely improved my skin texture. It gently encouages the natural exfoliation of skin. My skin redness has decreased and I&#x27;ve noticed that although I&#x27;m still sensitive to the sun while using this, my skin is not as sensitive as when I use the name brand/ prescription, RETIN-A. I would use this in conjunction with benzoyl peroxide, or a lactic acid treatment if your goal is clearer skin.</li>
    <li> Works good but I think I need something a little stronger for my congested skin</li>
    <li> Just haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell a BIG results but hopefully will know something with the next month.  I use it with the Niacinamide Vitamin Be Sermun.  Anyone that has problems with melanomas and is fair skinned please try and stay out of the sun when using the Retin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using retinol products for years and this one is by far the best. Great price for the quality. I have rosacea and this does not irritate my skin and keeps it very clear. I hope Amazon always sells this!</li>
    <li> bought it to pair with my BNZD lotion, also bought the CLNs face wash&lt;br /&gt;so far it&#x27;s all working great.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought their concealer from there website(not amazon) was the wrong color so i asked for refund,&lt;br /&gt;Skin by Pom immediately refunded me the money without receiving the product yet. Great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my favorite product is the BNZD lotion.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE PRODUCTS. I  am an Esthetician and educator and I tried these products for my problematic acne prone skin.  Gentle but effective blend of ingredients. Excellent results.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find any retinol products suited to my sensitive skin locally so decided to order through amazon. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product other than to help with the clarity of my skin. I am so very impressed with this - it seems to have resurfaced my skin, my skin is smoother, radiant and the clarity is noticeable.

The company (POM) seems to take great pride in their range and customer satisfaction. I am very pleased and will be trying more of their products soon.</li>
    <li> Within a week my skin became much clearer and softer. Doesn&#x27;t make my skin red and irritated like some retinol products do.</li>
    <li> This product is the closest thing to prescription Retin-A that I&#x27;ve been able to find. As such, the same precautions should be used (like avoiding sun exposure). In the few weeks I&#x27;ve been using it I have seen real improvement in dark spots, and smoother skin. It&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
    <li> So good! it doesn&#x27;t have any of the random useless ingredients that most manufacturers put in their products, and gently exfoliates, making skin clearer but without irritation or redness.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a month and it has a good effect. The product looks, smells and feels great, already after a few days of use I could tell it was making a difference.I use retin in the evening, benzd in the morning. I have had acne for over ten years and tried a whole bunch of products, these products make a bigger difference than any other I have tried so far. Acne can have many causes and treatments, there is no universal soloution, but I would reccommend anyone with acne to at least try these products.</li>
    <li> Acne on the face well blossomed always been greatly reduced When I was contemplating using this product a few days. The red skin looks shiny. Sarajini face is shining. Thank you for a great product, we will continue to patronize often.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good product!!!</li>
    <li> Good product!! I use it under a moisturizing night cream. Appears to significantly improve the texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product based on the natural approach and its ingredients.  It does minimize dryness and irritation as more chemically oriented retinoids tend to produce, but the first two times I used this product, I had more blemishes the night after than I had had before.  The emulsifying wax or sunflower seed oil (ingredients #2 and #3) might have blocked my pores, oil-based ingredients being not such a great choice for acne-prone skin.  Have stopped using the product, and cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product only a few times when I skip my prescription Retin-A. I like the smell of it, and it works really well for overnight clear-ups. I use it under a moisturizing night cream.</li>
