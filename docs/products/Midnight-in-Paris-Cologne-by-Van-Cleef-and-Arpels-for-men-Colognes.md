      <li>You better buy it because the quality of this juice worth more than you paid for, excellent presentation with a beautiful bottle and low price, the best combination of both worlds.</li>

      <li>Nice smell, better than what I thought to be.</li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>(Or buy many bottles as it will surely go up in price in years to come.)</li>
      <li>My favorite cologne ever is Ecada Magnetism and it was discontinued so now it is selling for over a $100 dollars.</li>
      <li>an oversized collection (500+), Midnight in Paris is the most versatile fragrance in my stable.  </li>
      <li>It is safe for any environment and will garner many compliments.  </li>
      <li>it cant be the authentic  formula</li>
      <li>Its a very warm scent, very inviting.</li>

      <li>Wow, this is a gorgeous scent!  </li>
      <li>it not a projection beast but does pretty well i think this is good for women as well</li>
      <li>/&gt;Very unique scent !</li>
      <li>Some won&#x27;t like it as it is a pretty sweet fragrance for a man, but it&#x27;s a great smelling fragrance.</li>
      <li>good quality, nice desing, and perfect present, thanks so much</li>
      <li>Not only is it a beautiful blend of amber, floral, herbal, and tonka bean notes, it can be worn any time of year and to most occasions.  </li>
      <li>(though the &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34; scent fades fairly quickly) with a very light yet noticeable floral yet smokey.</li>
      <li>very clean, like laundry clean</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s supposed to be discontinued soon, so buy it while it&#x27;s still available at such an attractive price.</li>
      <li>It is definitely unisex and would smell great on a man or a woman.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A  frangance that reminds me a lot of Black by Bvlgari, with the rubbery note tone down and then Dior Homme Sport (2012 version) by Dior with the powdery note added in. I would classify this as a nice fall scent for a date or even a casual night.  You could even wear this in the early winter.  The only thing is, I would not wear this if you want to make a statement in a bar or club.  This is more of a nice date scent.  I got about 6 hours on my skin and the projection was average. For the price and quality of the frangance and bottle, it&#x27;s well worth it.  Hurry up... as this is discontinued from what I have read.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful winter frag! Leathery, incense, and creamy vanilla vibe to it. When it begins to dry down you start to enjoy the citrus and florals. This one smells pretty gourmand like to me, but it is not overwhelmingly sweet. I often find myself smelling my wrist just to enjoy the scent.</li>
    <li> it dose not work for me,</li>
    <li> When I received the cologne, it wasn&#x27;t what I expected. It has grown on me now, and my wife loves it. It&#x27;s a deferent kind of smell, but it&#x27;s really ok!!!</li>
    <li> A great gem amongst many overhyped colognes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for this fragrance. Excellent price and speedy delivery. Item was new in the box and carefully packaged for shipping.</li>
    <li> Great smell very long lasting</li>
    <li> I can definitely pick up on the incense that are in this cologne. Its somewhat warm, but not like a heating warmth. It smells great at sunset on a summer or spring eve as it mixes well with the smell of nature cooling down for the day. The incense I pick up on as it settles on the skin which I jokingly say it makes me smell like a hippie. But I don&#x27;t mind that. I love incense! This is definitely a cooler weather scent and it is quite magical when used at the right times.</li>
    <li> This was a try-out for me. Too masculine for my liking but will keep it. There will probably be opportunities to wear it. Love Van Cleef and Arpels perfume, this just wasn&#x27;t a great hit for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s has been great to me!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Fruity and floral with a musk undertone-a heady musky undertone. Smooth, not sharp. A pleasant unctuousness. An absolutely wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> This is a hidden gem in the fragrance world. I remember when it came out, with much fanfare and marketing spend. Apparently, it was not a commercial success since it is not sold anywhere close to the price points of winners like Acqua di Gio. Yet it&#x27;s far better than that fragrance, and most other offerings from designers. It has a beautiful bottle, and the stuff inside is no less beautiful. Great projection, longevity, and one of the best tobacco notes you can hope to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s supposed to be discontinued soon, so buy it while it&#x27;s still available at such an attractive price. (Or buy many bottles as it will surely go up in price in years to come.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been unlucky with some counterfeits (plenty of them going around), but this is the real deal.  So, if you&#x27;re a fan of this cologne, this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Very nice! My husband loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great smell!  I received  a lot of compliments and received a lot of questions about the name of the perfume.  Its a kind of sweet but string at the same time.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the opening and the mid, but the dry down after 3+hrs isn&#x27;t pleasing to me and it last all day on my skin.  I was beyond happy to wash it off. This was a blind buy because people compared it to bvlgari black.  Now I love the bvlgari black scent. I&#x27;m  very familiar with it and they do smell a bit simlar in the opening.  After a hour they smell totally different from each other and bvlgari is the clear winner for me. I&#x27;m glad I picked up a bottle of this for my collection, but I won&#x27;t wear it again.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a powdery, more distinguished type of fragrance. Not bad.</li>
    <li> not bad for the price,,nice floral scent,,</li>
    <li> The perfume is very expensive.the smell  last only seconds on the body.no I will not recommended</li>
    <li> Ok I must first off by saying this, Its different...&lt;br /&gt;It smells like a dark twisted vanilla and burgamot woodsy feel.&lt;br /&gt;Also very clean, like laundry clean when its warm and refreshing&lt;br /&gt;This stuff actually dose last awhile&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed it 3 times on me, lasted 12 hours&lt;br /&gt;This type of cologne seems to be unisex more than anything, but has a masculine hit to it with the spice.&lt;br /&gt;This Cologne has &amp;#34;I smell comfortable, HUG ME&#x27;&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;and Ive been Hugged raped so many times since ive worn this</li>
    <li> The bottle has a very nice design.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very nice scent. A bit of bitter burnt rubber feel to it.  It has a moderate life and silage is moderate and not offensive.&lt;br /&gt;I can imagine it as a nice scent to wear in a cold night in a city with a leather jacket and pair of jeans.&lt;br /&gt;Not the kind of stuff I would wear with a suit.</li>
    <li> a lot of people don&#x27;t realize this is actually a niche fragrance. It is beautiful. Off the top with some leather and tonka. But the beauty is in the mid and base. You get this creamy vanilla incense smell. Don&#x27;t miss this it&#x27;s not manufactured anymore.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable scent.. I am approached by women asking what scent I am wearing... It&#x27;s more of a Cologne  that is noticed when you are close to someone. Long lasting.. You will not smell the scent after application. But believe  me  it still present.. The scent was created in 2010..</li>
    <li> very powdery, kinda smells like you just got done hugging your grandmother (im not saying thats a bad thing, but i sure dont prefer it), but once the powder wears off it leaves a sweet smokey smell.</li>
    <li> I love this fragance, it&#x27;s the only way to describe it!!! I own a lot of fragances including Pure Malt by Thierry Mugler, Dirty English by Juicy Couture, I love NY for all by Bond no.9, Reflection Man by Amouage, Terre de Hermes, Dior Homme Intense, etc. But my favorite fragance by this moment is Midnight in Paris, one of the best creations of Master Perfumer Olivier Polge, it&#x27;s absolute romance in a bottle . You better buy it because the quality of this juice worth more than you paid for, excellent presentation with a beautiful bottle and low price, the best combination of both worlds. I insist buy it, a must in your collection!!! Women will love it!</li>
    <li> I read the hype on this one and ended up blind buying it. To me, it smells amazing. You get a sweet leather and vanilla opening that dries down just a bit powdery and keeps the tonka bean scent throughout. It lasts a very long time on my skin and has great projection. My wife feels it smells just slightly feminine because of the vanilla and powder (and is the reason I took 1 star off) but to me it just smells really, really good and at this price point worth blind buying and trying.</li>
    <li> The cologne smells great but does not last for a long time.  The scent is similar to an older version of a polo cologne.  The bottling is good.</li>
    <li> Yesterday was my birthday – 48 and still roguishly handsome..!!  My girlfriend gave me both - Midnight in Paris and Rochas Man as presents.  Based on reviews, and being budget conscientious, I had mentioned these previously and to my surprise – received them as presents.  My girlfriend is amazing – she continually supports my fascination with fragrance collecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an oversized collection (500+), Midnight in Paris is the most versatile fragrance in my stable.  Not only is it a beautiful blend of amber, floral, herbal, and tonka bean notes, it can be worn any time of year and to most occasions.  It is safe for any environment and will garner many compliments.  Hard to believe that today was my first day experiencing (a) Midnight in Paris and I am in awe and left thinking, “where have you been all my life?”.  Longevity and projection/sillage are above average, lasting 7+ hours on me and still going strong on clothing 9 hours later – all at arm’s length distance.  As noted from my Fragrantica colleagues, the bottle is extraordinary and the true beauty of MiP is the price – it cannot be beat for the quality of the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final tally for Midnight in Paris is a 4.7 stars out of 5 stars with a solid recommendation to add to your collection.  For the Fragrantica following, it is definitely a “Love”..!! I will also add, MiP is the most under-rated fragrance I have experienced.  For obvious reasons, this fragrance has a special sentimental value – To my beautiful girlfriend – thank you, Blondie, for the present – you are the love of my life…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting…</li>
    <li> MUST HAVE for collectors!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely GORGEOUS fragrance, perfect year-round but really most suited for fall/winter.  This is what Blvgari Black should&#x27;ve been, it&#x27;s a modern masterpiece and worth every penny.  I mostly get a tea/smoky leather type scent, great longevity but not &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34; projection which is perfect.  I can&#x27;t recommend this enough, 10/10.  And thanks to Amazon for rectifying a defective sprayer by sending a new bottle, we are thrilled with Amazon&#x27;s customer service as well!</li>
    <li> Smells VERY nice but stays very close to skin and doesn&#x27;t last long at all.For intimate encounters with someone you&#x27;re already close too. Do not expect it to reach out, grab and dazzle anyone, don&#x27;t think it was designed to do that. It&#x27;s like Dolce and Garbanna&#x27;s &#x27;The One&#x27;. Very well crafted but meant to be appreciated up close and personal. As for what it smells like...if Bulgari Black and Escada Magnetism had a baby...it would smell like this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this not knowing what it smelled like! I am a cologne collector if you will... My favorite cologne ever is Ecada Magnetism and it was discontinued so now it is selling for over a $100 dollars. Then i got this today smelled it and was happy that i don&#x27;t have to dpent that much for it because this smell nearly the same if not identical.</li>
    <li> Just my humble opinion... I am 22 and got it partly because of the fantastic bottle and romantic name, however I don&#x27;t seem to wear it much. I live in a college town and usually choose something that smells very fresh and clean. The other nights (say in the fall/winter) where I go with more of a spice cologne, I still end up choosing something else... Unique smell but I guess not for me.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful scent. Just say right off the back while it does say for men this is definitely a scent that can go for men or women.  Its a very warm scent, very inviting. There is a bit of a floral note that at the time is kind of smokey. This scent is perfect for the metro-sexual male though if you are one of the very masculine tough guys this is not the scent for you :)</li>
    <li> Not a musky scent. Not an exciting scent. Not a really spreading scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really nice scent that sits pleasantly for a long period of time without spreading too far. You can get away with wearing this to work in small rooms without bothering others. But it still smells very pleasant and I am really fond of it.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, better than what I thought to be. Yes I agree certainly a unisex type of scent. Otherwise, still made for a man.</li>
    <li> My favorite!  Totally worth the cost.</li>
    <li> The bottle is so beautiful.</li>
    <li> This scent is amazing. Def packs a punch and will get you a lot of compliments. Not overly sweet and very complex. Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Very impressed, nice smooth mellow but distinctive smell...  My girl loves it.</li>
    <li> Fine, an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I buy my husband&#x27;s fragrances, since I am the one who has to smell them...This is by far my favorite, it has such a complex smell, fresh but not simple. The price cannot be beat, also. Fragrance is a personal chemistry thing, so I don&#x27;t know if it will smell as good on everybody, but this a sophisticated scent that should be tried. I use it myself sometimes, don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too masculine at all.</li>
    <li> This is the best, it smells great and lasts longer then the whole day.  People always ask me what I am wearing</li>
    <li> Great scent. Its exactly what fragrance reviewer&#x27;s have been saying it is. It is a very nice inoffensive scent that can be used year-round. The only knock on it is that the notes and overall composition isn&#x27;t unique.</li>
    <li> Soft scent, not strong at all. LuvIt, Luvit!</li>
    <li> Great service and the cologne is wonderful.  However, the bottle leaked so when the gift was open there was cologne all over.  About one-third of the bottle was gone!</li>
    <li> This smells really good, but of course that may be my opinion.  I think most people would like this.  I&#x27;m going to try the mens next.  Bought the wrong one and this one is probably not as potent.</li>
    <li> This scent isn&#x27;t for every man. Its starts off with a hint of  lemon if you sneeze you might miss it. Its also powdery floral opening just grabs your attention. My only dislike about this fragrance is it doesn&#x27;t last on my skin but its still worth a sniff. If you like floral and powdery fragrances this is a very lovely scent. I hear the EDP version is good as well its a bit on the pricey side though but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Great cologne, unique smell that makes the scent stand out more than the mainstream colognes that stink up the joint!</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying the Edp version but I receive the edt you guys really have to work on your ads need to start sending what you advertise.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. Everyone comments on it and now I had to buy another for my son because he loved it as well. Really great scent.</li>
    <li> I just love the comments and questions when I wear this frangrance. Can&#x27;t wait until I finish with this frangrance. I am only going to purchase a bigger bottle</li>
    <li> Some won&#x27;t like it as it is a pretty sweet fragrance for a man, but it&#x27;s a great smelling fragrance.</li>
    <li> This my third bottle of Midnight in Paris cologne --- simply because it&#x27;s the best fragrance I&#x27;ve worn in the last 3 years. It&#x27;s become my personal signature scent for year-round use that I&#x27;m still asked about. Truly masculine and subtle in its attraction. Never overpowering or offensive. Mixes well with my natural after-shower body smell well into the evening. Married or single, you cannot avoid the obvious facial appreciation and occasional \\&quot;What are you wearing?\\&quot; questions from women (and a few men) at work or elsewhere. For this and a few other personal choice reasons, MiP continues to be the right cologne choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Midnight in Paris hit all the right notes for me when I wanted an all-purpose high quality everyday wear cologne that did not have a cliche or overstated masculine smell. No kidding, I surprisingly got a few of the same reactions during a 6-day trip to Paris this summer while riding the Metro and in a neighborhood shop. Being that I was obviously an American, at times it made me wonder what most American men traveling in France usually (or are expected to) smell like to French women. Who cares, MiP works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Van Cleef &amp; Arpels never stop making this scent. I wish there was a soap or aftershave version of MiP as well.</li>
    <li> The scent is nice and lively but not overpowering. A good scent for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> This is an AMAZING cologne My husband was amaze when I gave it to him I love the way is smell and the durability is great.. The shipping was extremely fast!</li>
    <li> I bought 6 if these as gifts straight from Amazon.  Real stuff.  Great price.  Intoxicating and unisex.  The florals and vanilla are restrained with Amber incenses.  Really yummy stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance, definitely a unisex fragrance, dry down is a bit powdery, this will last on me all day.</li>
    <li> Love this!!!! My new favorite fall cologne</li>
    <li> Great fragrance! Super fast delivery! Item just as described!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this scent. It gives me my sweet leather fix. Definitely an evening/fall/winter scent, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> is excelent... good quality, nice desing, and perfect present, thanks so much</li>
    <li> Wow, this is a gorgeous scent!  When you first spray it there is a strange rubber note (but in a good way!) and then it develops into a really nice vanilla with hints of leather.  I also smell incense.  The fragrance is not a really in your face kind of scent but very nice and pleasant.  I have a lot of scents so it is rare for me to wear something a week straight but I did with this one.  It is definitely unisex and would smell great on a man or a woman.  It is really great on its on but I paired it with a perfume oil that had apricot/peach note and it made it even better!</li>
    <li> Stumbled on this quite by accident, actually the bottle STAR SCAPE is what caught my eye, corny yes, but true.  I have several scents Van Cleef &amp; Arpels this one like the other continues to please me with out being overpowering, on my third bottle and plan to buy more when it runs out, very pleased</li>
    <li> This scent was everything I was looking for and more.</li>
    <li> RaJuR real deep kool on the web and YOUTUBE!!!</li>
    <li> Live this fragrance. U walked into a women hair salon. Let me tell you. I was stop like an police pulling over to give me a ticket. Lol. Yeah an you know man lol.  Nah but I get compliments up the wall.</li>
    <li> Hell no smells like dirt it cant be the authentic  formula</li>
    <li> very nice and inexpensive  fragrance nice</li>
    <li> leather ,smoky,rosy tanka been.. thats basically it not a projection beast but does pretty well i think this is good for women as well i would recommend getting the the EDP version for gentlmen..</li>
    <li> This is a nice smell,but to eachs own! IMO unisex women will love it on you because they probably want to wear it too! I get powdery,rubber (though the &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34; scent fades fairly quickly) with a very light yet noticeable floral yet smokey. Lasts about 5&lt;br /&gt;hours on the skin probably longer on clothes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very unique scent ! Very unisex! Women will probably like this more than men. Definitely something different for your collection and a very nice bottle!!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is just not your one-of-the-mill fragrances for men.  I purchased this fragrance for my son, who requested it specifically.  It is manly and stands out from the fragrances that many other men use.  The fragrance is pleasant but not  overpowering.  If you want to receive compliments, just try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Ordered from Amazon...cologne was legit. For the 4.2 EDT this was a steal on Amazon. This stuff used to go for over $100 for the 4.2 size. If you have never smelled Midnight in Paris...I can best describe it as very powdery. It is for men, however I find this to be a very feminine scent. I actually gave it to my wife who loves it.  I will wear it on occasion but definitely not one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> This reminds me of my Tom Ford Black Orchid, with a subtler hint of anise, which I love, but the only downside is it&#x27;s not long lasting as the scent wears off after a few hours.</li>
    <li> Balmy spicy leather, cold creamy powder dry down. Sophisticated, classy, smooth and easy to wear. Love it.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the money. Would not buy againg though, smells like sweet or too strong. Love the regular Van Cleef in the black bottle.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance!  Smells SUPER!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> At $32 this is a steel it smell so good one of my favorites</li>
</ol>
