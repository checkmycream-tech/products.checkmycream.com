      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, compact, and perfect for travel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually very happy with this shaver except for one fatal flaw - it&#x27;s already giving signs of crapping out.</li>
      <li>Best portable shaver made.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>For the money, the best travel razor I have  ever had,</li>
      <li>ans has a geat trimmer iam very happy with it .</li>
      <li>Great battery powered shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for travel!</li>
      <li>doesnt shave very good the way I was thinking</li>
      <li>very good shaver, I got one.</li>
      <li>It is great and the company was excellent.</li>
      <li>but it works great on her chin whiskers.  </li>
      <li>They are great.</li>
      <li>The one that works is great.  </li>
      <li>Therefore, I&#x27;m not too happy with this product.</li>
      <li>I think it is a great little&lt;br /&gt;shaver.</li>
      <li>Great shaver it does the job easier when l cut my hair</li>
      <li>This is a great value for a backup battery operated shaver.  </li>
      <li>Very nice shaver.  </li>
      <li>This shaver does a very nice job.</li>
      <li>It finishes the job, nicely!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work good</li>
      <li>Good</li>
      <li>This is a really good shaver.</li>
      <li>but the design is not that good</li>
      <li>Does a good job shaving as well.</li>
      <li>Good</li>
      <li>So, I give the Eltron 5-stars and call it the best cheap razor on the market today.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t that great; I will keep looking for one that is more robust.</li>
      <li>It has a feisty motor, a nice foil, and what seem to be good blades.</li>
      <li>The best inexpensive travel shaver, as a shaver, right now seems to be the Panasonic ES3831K, but that model does not have a trimmer.    </li>
      <li>I liked this a LOT, however, it got knocked off counter accidently on day 2 and had to be thrown away because foil screen tore and resulted in a severe safety hazard.</li>
      <li>In this regard the 2AA Panasonic seems better; although the Braun has a superior foil cover system.    </li>
      <li>It gives a nice shave.</li>
      <li>I found the Eltron Compact Travel Shaver to be an effective, light-weight travel companion eliminating the need for adapters, power chords and electricity when traveling abroad.  </li>
      <li>Compact design, close shave, nice trimmer.</li>
      <li>I keep a shaver handy all the time, hair on my face bothers me...</li>
      <li>Nice trimmer too.  </li>
      <li>Nice size,,,,easy use....clean shave....</li>
      <li>The finish on the motor housing is not all that great, but it belies all that and is a pretty good shaver.</li>
      <li>This shaver is good for the ladies leggs in my house, has power, leaves me with the razor bumps not so smooth.</li>
      <li>Worked great the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>A mighty midget,well designed and engineered,and has a built in hair trimmer,also!.</li>
      <li>you won&#x27;t find anything better for the price.</li>
      <li>I love it and also use it for weekend</li>
      <li>THIS IS A GREAT BATTERY OPERATED RAZOR GOOD FOR SHORT TRIPS.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Use alkaline batteries for best performance - or NiMH rechargeables if you use it often enough.</li>
      <li>This would be my favorite shaver ever, if it was durable, but as it is, I recommend do not buy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>EDIT The 2 more I ordered</li>
      <li>have purchased it as I am going overseas and it will be more convenient than a rechargeable shaver</li>
      <li>Will have more to say after I use it more often.</li>
      <li>It will take more time to get a close shave.</li>
      <li>This is a much more robust design than a clip on cover (which both the Eltron and Panasonic have), and means you don&#x27;t need a rubber band or separate case for the shaver - you can just throw it in whatever bag or case you use for toiletries.    </li>
      <li>worked ok but stopped working after one week of travel.</li>
      <li>IT DOES NOT TAKE THE PLACE OF A REGULAR SIZE RAZOR, BUT IS PERFECT FOR TRAVEL.</li>
      <li>I love these eltron razors.</li>
      <li>By definition, a travel shaver should be able to travel safely, and this one can&#x27;t.    </li>
      <li>I even ordered two more as backups.</li>
      <li>I sure  would not have orderedd any more.</li>
      <li>They all love them.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty good</li>
      <li>Not a bad  return on the investment, I could be convinced to get another one, but there are more and more interesting travel shavers on the market now...</li>
      <li>The shaver came fast and was well packaged and in good condition.</li>
      <li>Like the pop-up trimmer....seems to be easy on batteries....</li>
      <li>It does click into both positions, but it does not slide easily like the on/off switch.</li>
      <li>There is no release button to push and there are no ridges on the sides to make it easy to grasp.</li>
      <li>That said, it is not as easy as it should be.</li>
      <li>Maybe it would be better for a guy with a full face of hair.</li>
      <li>I got a very good dry shave without any irritation.</li>
      <li>The on/off switch functions smoothly and easily, but it does not have any type of travel lock.</li>
      <li>The shaver works fine</li>
      <li>Very compact but works as good as a full sized shaver.  </li>
      <li>Bought it as a backup for traveling and quick touch-ups - but it functions much better than I anticipated.  </li>
      <li>Delivers a smooth shave and has a built in trimmer to boot.</li>
      <li>It is comfortable, ergonomic in your hands, and balanced.</li>
      <li>Have only had it for a month or so, but works great.  </li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>The protective cap to cover the foil is cheap and might not stay on when the shaver is packed for travel without a rubberband.</li>
      <li>/&gt;GENERAL ADVICE FOR USING ANY ELECTRIC SHAVER: Please keep in mind that no electric shaver will work well on more than two days worth of growth.</li>
      <li>Leaves his skin smooth.</li>
      <li>He really likes it &amp; was impressed with the shave he got from such a compact shaver.</li>
      <li>It is also easy to clean quickly even though it is not water washable.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly quick and smooth.</li>
      <li>ordered the Eltron Compact Travel Shaver, and while it works beautifully, though I would not recommend its use for other than travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cheap, but worth it.</li>
      <li>You really need a trimmer with a foil shaver, as most foil shavers can&#x27;t get longer hairs.</li>
      <li>a true battery shaver.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really good for taking on short trips.</li>
      <li>good: The hole pattern on the foil is traditional (as compared to the \\&quot;smartfoil\\</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>The plastic cap covering the foil head will not stay on, but a rubber band quickly solved that problem.</li>
      <li>quick shaves.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small runs on batteries and provides a very good shave were ever you are.</li>
      <li>Powerful little shaver, very portable and perfect for travel</li>
      <li>Great small travelling razor, easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and if I make sure to keep the blades clean it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>Compact, great shave in comparison to my previous travel razor, trimmer a bonus</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can confirm what other reviewers said about the clear cap that covers the foil coming off a little too easy, and having to struggle a little to both get the part with the foil off and to push up the trimmer, though time helped with that. As for battery life, my rechargeable batteries last me a solid month or more (I don&#x27;t have a thick beard by any means, but I do shave it everyday). Have to press the trimmer into the machine so it works well, but it definitely helps for those hairs that are longer or grow in awkward directions. I personally experienced little to no irritation, especially after the first week.  Over a year of use later, I dropped this guy for the first and only time WITH the cover on, and to my great disappointment the cover uselessly shattered, sending pieces everywhere, and the foil STILL got bent in. I tried to contact Eltron about getting a replacement foil, but didn&#x27;t get a response. (On the site, they have a hard to see picture of the blades, where it doesn&#x27;t look like the foil is included, and they cost as much as new unit does today anyways.)   2 years seems to be about it&#x27;s life span, as the trimmer no longer clicked into place (had to be manually held up the whole time) and the battery lid was damaged just from changing batteries over time. Not a bad  return on the investment, I could be convinced to get another one, but there are more and more interesting travel shavers on the market now...</li>
    <li> Good performer but poorly built.  Like the compact size, power and performance.  However, the  battery compartment frequently comes unlocked  during use (with irritating result) and the foil protective case is so poorly designed that I ended up damaging the foil after the second use when the edge of the plastic cover jammed into the side of the foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A real lesson in getting what you pay for and the risks of online purchase.</li>
    <li> Compact, great shave in comparison to my previous travel razor, trimmer a bonus</li>
    <li> Compact design, close shave, nice trimmer.</li>
    <li> I keep this in my glove compartment for when I need it.  It is great and the company was excellent.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t that great; I will keep looking for one that is more robust.</li>
    <li> I was very dissatisfied with the performance of this razor. The trimmer does not work at all and the razor does not cut! I would never recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Performed just as expected, it is small and easy to pack, no need to carry yet another charging device, uses standard batteries.</li>
    <li> Will have more to say after I use it more often. have purchased it as I am going overseas and it will be more convenient than a rechargeable shaver</li>
    <li> This it not a powerful as a regular sized razor, however it is what you expect for a mini electric razor.  Just what is needed for travel.</li>
    <li> I found the Eltron Compact Travel Shaver to be an effective, light-weight travel companion eliminating the need for adapters, power chords and electricity when traveling abroad.  Excellent in the woods while camping as well.  I particularly liked the side-burn trim feature, something frequently not found on competitive models.  Its use of commonly found batteries was a real plus.  I would not hesitate to recommend this shaver to anyone</li>
    <li> This is a really good shaver. I have sensitive skin and if I make sure to keep the blades clean it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> This shaver is good for the ladies leggs in my house, has power, leaves me with the razor bumps not so smooth. The wife loves it</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised.  Gift for my father</li>
    <li> First one I ordered had a defect and they replaced it really fast. This shaver does a very nice job. It shaves closer than my $120 Norelco. I have a goatee and it works well for trimming. I usually use my Norelco then spruce up with this one. It&#x27;s really good for taking on short trips.</li>
    <li> Great shaver it does the job easier when l cut my hair</li>
    <li> Best portable shaver made.&lt;br /&gt;I do not like to keep rechargeable electric razors in my car,desk drawer or briefcase.&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable razors loose there charge too fast.&lt;br /&gt;Like a true battery shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband thinks this is the greatest, closest shave he can get.  I have ordered a spare one for the future so he will not be without one,  He prefers it to his large expensive shaver.</li>
    <li> I keep one at my desk and one in my car to help with the 5 oclock shadow at just the right time with minimal inconvenience.</li>
    <li> this is no good! no good! I tell you one more time - NO GOOD! compact travel shaver of nothing!</li>
    <li> Eltron has a reputation for quality, and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with a product that bears the name &amp;#34;Eltron.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Eltron Compact Travel Shaver, and while it works beautifully, though I would not recommend its use for other than travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about the Eltron is that the cutting blade is the type and size you would find in a much more expensive shaver.  Most inexpensive shavers (based on my experience) is that the cutters are small and fail to give a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the Eltron Compact Travel Shaver maintains Eltron&#x27;s quality reputation.</li>
    <li> Worked great the first time I used it.  Then when I needed to use it again X months later it was totally dead.  Changing batteries did nothing.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver for my backpacking trip.  The shaver is less than 3 oz, but it doesn&#x27;t cut as clean as my Panasonic ES3831 (about 5.4 oz).  It takes about twice as long to shave with Eltron than with Panasonic.  Trading weight for efficiency...</li>
    <li> I bought one for a 3 month Pacific trip to Hawaii, Australia, NZ, Tonga, and I used it almost every day. It worked great!  Changed the batteries once and it is still going strong on the second set. Really, I am amazed at how well it performed.  I would buy another if I lost this one.</li>
    <li> Very small, with a solid feel to it. Runs on 2x AAs (which last a long time). Good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave is not \\&quot;extra\\&quot; close. The good from that is the foil should last a long time (because it is &#x27;thick&#x27;).&lt;br /&gt;I use the shaver for only one or two minutes, and then use a cheap disposable razor (less hurt for my skin, closer shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair trimmer must be operated while you hold the shaver horizontally, awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair trimmer when extended, needs a LOT of force to be put back. Hurts my thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing all of the above, I would still buy it again.</li>
    <li> Husband wanted to try this out for an upcoming trip, as it was more compact than a regular shaver.  He really likes it &amp; was impressed with the shave he got from such a compact shaver.</li>
    <li> It gives a close shave (for an electric razor). I like the fact that it uses AA batteries, which last for a long time, rather than fussing with a rechargable. It&#x27;s lightweight, compact, and perfect for travel. The plastic cap covering the foil head will not stay on, but a rubber band quickly solved that problem.</li>
    <li> a little larger than my last travel razor but with the trimmer feature it&#x27;s a space saver over all. if you have longer tripsand eventually need to trim a beard or mustache this is the ticket. shave and trim in a tiny package.</li>
    <li> This is the little shaver that could. It has a feisty motor, a nice foil, and what seem to be good blades. It gives a nice shave. It is comfortable, ergonomic in your hands, and balanced. The finish on the motor housing is not all that great, but it belies all that and is a pretty good shaver. It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> +One of the few that has trimmer +AA powered  -Battery door is too easy to accidentally open -Foil shavers can&#x27;t seem to handle longer hairs -Has a poor electrical contact somewhere, so I have to press on the switch to keep it running right</li>
    <li> Nice size,,,,easy use....clean shave....needs foil replacements....how to order them???.Good price for the product.  Like the pop-up trimmer....seems to be easy on batteries....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned at least one of these shavers for many years. It&#x27;s small runs on batteries and provides a very good shave were ever you are. I use mine as a trimmer as well as a shaver. The plastic cover over the foil could fit a little bit tighter but for the price I can live with it the way it is.</li>
    <li> Small and cheap but do its job very well. No need of expensive &amp;#34;high technology&amp;#34; shavers. I have this little wonder in my car, saving me time every morning in front of the mirror. I have sensitive skin and no matter what type of blades or foam I use, I always get cut. With this thing there is no more blood in my face, thanks Eltron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah! I have large hands and I have no problem using this shaver, and although this shaver don&#x27;t &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; batteries, if you don&#x27;t want the surprise of discharged ones when you need an urgent shaving, then place a couple of extra ones in the car or in the place you are using it.</li>
    <li> i was completely surprised at how well this shaver performed, and the trimmer is no punk either it will tear through some ruff stuff. you won&#x27;t find anything better for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a good little shaver.  Bought it as a backup for traveling and quick touch-ups - but it functions much better than I anticipated.  Pretty fast, pretty close shaves.  Good value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use alkaline batteries for best performance - or NiMH rechargeables if you use it often enough.</li>
    <li> I liked this a LOT, however, it got knocked off counter accidently on day 2 and had to be thrown away because foil screen tore and resulted in a severe safety hazard. I was really sad.</li>
    <li> Cheap, but worth it. Put rechargeable NiMH AA&#x27;s in it.</li>
    <li> The shaver works fine but the design is not that good - it&#x27;s very hard to open the lid to clean it because the bad angle when your hand is wet or oily. The beard trimmer is not necessary - it&#x27;s just blocking the opening of the top. Give it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Have only had it for a month or so, but works great.  The cover needs to be rubber-banded to keep it on, but for the price, it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
    <li> worked ok but stopped working after one week of travel. Never could get it to work again.</li>
    <li> Very light and cut well for a small razor. The only reason it did not get 5 stars is it feels a bit plasticky so might not last well.</li>
    <li> For the money, the best travel razor I have  ever had,</li>
    <li> Just the right size. Does a good job shaving as well.</li>
    <li> Im on my third of these razors. They are great. Honestly seem to last about six months or so of reliable daily use. To no fault of the razors. I wore the foil out on the first one and my son just broke the battery lid off my second one. For the price or any price for that matter its hard to beat. Delivers a smooth shave and has a built in trimmer to boot. I love these eltron razors.</li>
    <li> Inferior shaver to Braun 2AA - tho cheaper.  Intermittent battery operation - whether with disposable Alkis, eneloops, OR 3.2V LiFePO4  &amp; dummy.    EDIT: Just an update.    Although, unfortunately, some whiskers get through to the battery compartment; I have found some success by firmly pushing the battery cover on the base towards the left [&#x27;e&#x27; on &#x27;eltron&#x27;] of the switch face.  It seems that this bottom battery lock is unreliable.    The battery cover for my 2AA Braun can also be a little tricky.  In this regard the 2AA Panasonic seems better; although the Braun has a superior foil cover system.    PS: Upgraded to 3 Stars.  Like our new [Oz] General leading \\&quot;the war on illegals\\&quot; fleeing deadly persecution; like the Jews in WW2?     PPS: I disassembled my unit at the end of its working lifetime.     THE CONSTRUCTION IS FLAWED - with inadequate seals to prevent whiskers falling through.   Over time, in spite of conscientious cleaning with each shave, this resulted in a heavy build up of whiskers in the body of the shaver. Electrical contact was then compromised; &amp; with the attraction of moisture to these whiskers, corrosion occurred.   And I do take care to store my shavers outside the [moist] bathroom.      If you wish to save a few dollars from the price of a Braun battery shaver (which on disassembly gave all the appearance of top quality automated German construction [eg BMW/Mercedes] - with excellent body sealing), then I would suggest constant, meticulous cleaning, &amp; storage in a dry environment.</li>
    <li> Great battery powered shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for travel!</li>
    <li> Very nice shaver.  Bought one for my mother as she started to get little &amp;#34;whiskers&amp;#34;.  She is elderly and in assisted living.  It is probably meant to be a man&#x27;s shaver but it works great on her chin whiskers.  So well that my sister wanted one and several of the girls that work at the facility.  I ordered a few more.  They all love them.  The trimmer cuts the longer hair and then you go over it with the shaver and it is very close.  I think it is a great little&lt;br /&gt;shaver.</li>
    <li> Edit 1/8/15  If you want a really small travel shaver, compare to this:  [[ASIN:B005IUR9CE Panasonic Men&#x27;s Shaver for Traveler ES-RS10-S Silver | DC3V (2 x AA Alkaline) (Japan Model)]]  -------    While great in principle, this shaver fails in execution.    Pros:  ---------  - Smallest and lightest of the $20-and-under travel shavers.    - Has a decent if not spectacular trimmer.  You really need a trimmer with a foil shaver, as most foil shavers can&#x27;t get longer hairs. If you miss a spot one day, or miss a day or two shaving, a pass with a trimmer can make a shaver like this remain practical.    Cons:  ---------  - Completely inadequate cover for the foil.  This is the deal breaker for a travel shaver. The cover barely stays on, and one of the clips on the side of ours quickly broke off. We still use it with a rubber band, but it&#x27;s only a matter of time before the foil is damaged because the cover comes off. Worse, I can&#x27;t get Eltron to respond about a replacement cover. By definition, a travel shaver should be able to travel safely, and this one can&#x27;t.    - Inadequate sealing of the case.  See another review that discusses a take-apart that shows that the innards are not properly protected from shaved hair bits getting inside. This is a poor design and build.    Comparison  ----------  The best inexpensive travel shaver, as a shaver, right now seems to be the Panasonic ES3831K, but that model does not have a trimmer.    The Braun M60 (blue, or maybe other, colored case) or M90 (black case), while it has a weird side trimmer that&#x27;s awkward to use, does have a trimmer, and also has the only integrated cover (the cover rotates around the case and stays attached). This is a much more robust design than a clip on cover (which both the Eltron and Panasonic have), and means you don&#x27;t need a rubber band or separate case for the shaver - you can just throw it in whatever bag or case you use for toiletries.    Both the Panasonic and Braun can be rinsed off if this is a feature you&#x27;d want, and I have (once) used my Braun M90 as a wet shaver.    I&#x27;d only get the Eltron if intended for very occasional use, or maybe as a starter shaver for a teen. Either the Panasonic or Braun travel shavers are ones you could use for years. Given that you&#x27;ll save under $9 (and maybe only $2-3) on the Eltron, it&#x27;s not a good buy.    Batteries  ---------  Whether you use a travel shaver daily, or just occasionally, look into getting a set of Sanyo Eneloop rechargeble batteries and a charger. In my experience (I use a travel shaver daily) the Eneloop rechargables last as long or longer than good quality disposable alkaline batteries. I normally get about a month of shaving from one charge. Also, for occasional users, Eneloop batteries hold their charge for many months, unlike regular rechargables, which tend to run down if not used for a month or two. I&#x27;ve been using the same set of Eneloop AA batteries in my travel shaver for several years now. Their only downside is that the Sanyo charger takes about 8 hours to get from run down to a full charge (but less if you are doing a \\&quot;top up\\&quot; charge before a trip).    If you are replacing a shaver with rechargable batteries, remember that they should be recycled, not tossed in the trash: the batteries contain toxic metals we don&#x27;t want in our landfills.</li>
    <li> It comes with a great little trimmer. However, the foil part of the shaver is not good enough. It will take more time to get a close shave. Also, it&#x27;s hard to take out the foil head in order to clean it. The foil shaver was the main reason why I was interested in this product. Therefore, I&#x27;m not too happy with this product. However, it&#x27;s cheap. It&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> Great small travelling razor, easy to use.  Does a great job and yet small enough to take anywhere on a trip or to work!</li>
    <li> This shaver is really small and easy to use and paci for trips.&lt;br /&gt;However, the shaving foil easily tears and is hard to replace.</li>
    <li> Shaver needs some redesign.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is very poor.</li>
    <li> First Impressions-The shaver itself is smaller than any travel shaver I have ever had before (smaller in height, width and depth). I do not have very big hands and find this to be a plus, especially for a travel shaver, but some with big hands may find it too small. The width of the shaving head is about the same as the Braun M60 and slightly smaller than the Panasonic ES3831K. The color is a deep blue/grey with silver accents. The plastic feels quite solid and the bottom cap mechanism where the batteries go is attached when opened so it will not be lost and works quite well. The protective cap to cover the foil is cheap and might not stay on when the shaver is packed for travel without a rubberband. Overall, the shaver is solid and quite compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: The hole pattern on the foil is traditional (as compared to the \\&quot;smartfoil\\&quot; design on the Braun M60 which I do not like). The shaver is not too loud when operating and it has a very functional trimmer. I got a very good dry shave without any irritation. That said, this shaver is slightly more harsh than the Braun M60, but in my opinion, much more effective at dry shaving. Unlike the Braun M-60, this shaver is not designed to be used wet nor is it water washable. The trimmer works well once extended and is positioned so that it can be used in combination with the foil, which is particularly helpful at shaving any missed or longer hairs, especially on the neck. A replacement foil and cutter pack is available directly from Eltron at a price which is well less than the cost of the shaver which is good for the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: The on/off switch functions smoothly and easily, but it does not have any type of travel lock. While it has a dot in the middle which matches the shaver body&#x27;s color and which I assumed was a button which needed to be pushed in order to switch on the shaver, it is just a decorative element and not a travel lock to prevent the shaver from being switched on while in yourbag. The trimmer, while very effective, is very difficult to push up into the on position and also very difficult to retract. It does click into both positions, but it does not slide easily like the on/off switch. Perhaps it will get easier over time. Finally, when done shaving, it is very difficult to remove the foil head assembly in order to brush off the blade. There is no release button to push and there are no ridges on the sides to make it easy to grasp. If you push one side of the head toward the other side, then you can lift the other side up and the head will come off for brush cleaning. That said, it is not as easy as it should be. Again, perhaps this will become easier over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: This shaver is solidly built, very compact, comes with a trimmer and gives an excellent dry shave for an extremely low price. It could certainly be used as an everyday shaver. I am using it with Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries and they seem to work quite well with this shaver. I expect the shaver will last quite a while. However, I would stay away from this shaver if you have arthritis or get frustrated trying to open things up which do not open easily. I would have given it five stars if there was a release button to remove the foil head assembly for blade cleaning. Overall, for me, this is a better shaver than the Braun M60 because it gives me a better dry shave which I prefer. For those who prefer a wet shave, the Braun does give an excellent wet shave. I have yet to try or compare the Panasonic ES3831K, but that is also said to be a better wet shaver than it is a dry shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/1/14--I have upped my rating to five stars. Everything I said previously is still true. However, the trimmer has gotten slightly easier to slide up and down as I have used the shaver more. Similarly, removing the foil head for cleaning has also gotten easier over time. Thus, these two flaws do not bother me as much as they used to in part because what is moreimportant is the overall quality of the shave. I have now also tried the Panasonic ES3831K, the Braun M60, the Mitaki Japan Shaver and the Philipps/Norelco PQ208 shavers. When compared to those other shavers this little Eltron gives me a superior shave. It is the closest shave in the least amount of time with absolutely no irritation whatsoever (and I have been prone to shaving irritation). It is also easy to clean quickly even though it is not water washable. Finally, this shaver has held up well over time. YMMV (your mileage may vary) as everybody&#x27;s face is different, but for me this is the best little battery operated shaver available and it sells for a very affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GENERAL ADVICE FOR USING ANY ELECTRIC SHAVER: Please keep in mind that no electric shaver will work well on more than two days worth of growth. If you do not shave every day or every other day at least, in my experience, most electric shavers will not work for you unless you first trim the long hair with a trimmer and then use an electric shaver. Much of the criticism I see in these reviews is by people who do not seem to have much electric shaver experience and who simply do not understand the limits of modern electric shavers. Electric shavers will generally not shave quite as close as a blade, but a good shaver which works well for your skin and hair type will come very close to blade shaving. It may take a while to find the right shaver for you and what works for one person may not work for another. Finally, when using any electric shaver, don&#x27;t press too hard (a light touch works better), don&#x27;t go too fast, and do go over the same area a few times approaching from different directions so you can catch the hairs which grow in different directions.</li>
    <li> I use a Mach 3 for my face, but it can&#x27;t get to the hard to reach places, like under my nose and around the lips; that&#x27;s where I bring this little monster out. It finishes the job, nicely!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly quick and smooth.I keep it in the glove compartment of my car. These are comments from my husband to whom I gave the razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually very happy with this shaver except for one fatal flaw - it&#x27;s already giving signs of crapping out. I&#x27;ve shaved with it maybe 20 times and it&#x27;s hesitating, slowing down then speeding back up, pausing for half a second then returning to normal. Amazon tells me it&#x27;s too late to return it, return period expired 8 days ago. Well, 8 days ago it was still behaving itself. I even ordered two more as backups. Had I expected a life of six weeks I sure  would not have orderedd any more. EDIT The 2 more I ordered gave the same trouble, even sooner than the first one, some kind of loose internal connection, and I returned them. I wrote the manufacturer about this problem, they acknowledged receipt of my message but made no further reply. This would be my favorite shaver ever, if it was durable, but as it is, I recommend do not buy.&lt;br /&gt;If it dies totally I&#x27;ll take it apart to see if I can find the problem.</li>
    <li> Truly amazing!..despatched from USA to UK and received in 4 days from placing order!!  The shaver itself is also amazing ,a little gem!. A mighty midget,well designed and engineered,and has a built in hair trimmer,also!. Buy it!.Its a steal !.</li>
    <li> i recived the shaver itwas small but does a great job for its size ans has a geat trimmer iam very happy with it .</li>
    <li> Works very well! I tried just the razor part, not the mustache trimmer, but I think it will perform as well as the shaver portion.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for a month or so.  Bought it to trim around my beard, but could easily shave my entire face in very little time.  So far it seems solid and cuts very well.</li>
    <li> Small and compact. Could do without the added trimmer though. Replaced a Panasonic that I had for 20 years; hope this one lasts half as long.</li>
    <li> This is a great value for a backup battery operated shaver.  Very compact but works as good as a full sized shaver.  Great to use for a quick touch up at the end of the day, or if you are running late in the morning and need to do a quick shave in the restroom at the office.  I love it and also use it for weekend quick shaves.  Nice trimmer too.  All of this for $10 - WOW!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work good I wouldn&#x27;t get it again for noone thank for asking again doesnt shave very good the way I was thinking</li>
    <li> The one that works is great.  The one with the dented head was trashed as not worth the cost of returning.</li>
    <li> Works well for a $10 or $12 shaver.  I got more than I expected.</li>
    <li> My last travel shaver died when I dropped it.  I could not find another one except on Amazon.  So yes, thank you.  It&#x27;s the closest to what I want.  I will come again.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I really like the Eltron #el-3040 Compact Travel Shaver!  This is my second one (just a back-up). Works well for me and is a perfect size.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT BATTERY OPERATED RAZOR GOOD FOR SHORT TRIPS.  IT DOES NOT TAKE THE PLACE OF A REGULAR SIZE RAZOR, BUT IS PERFECT FOR TRAVEL.</li>
    <li> Not a great shaver. I bought it for my elderly mom who has a couple of hairs that pop up on her chin, this thing wouldn&#x27;t touch them. Maybe it would be better for a guy with a full face of hair.</li>
    <li> Good, clean shave using a light, medium, or heavy touch.  Works with conventional or rechargeable AA batteries.  NiCD ones last more than 10 days for my beard.  Engaging the trimmer is difficult, but not all that bad; which is better than having it engage when you don&#x27;t want it to be cutting.  Tip:  use your thumbnail to remove the cover for cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is the worst razor I have ever seen. The battery cover will not stay on and if you hold it on it will run until you hold it on.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver for long term travel, can be used with rechargeable battries, many positive features in such a small shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my boyfriend and he loves it. He says it cuts close and edges well. Leaves his skin smooth. The shaver came fast and was well packaged and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Received this product this past Saturday the 20th of April. Also, purchased the Braun&#x27;s M-60, M-90 and one Panasonic ES3831. Nothing compares to the Eltron. There is an extra shaver on the backside as well as the one under the wire mesh. You slide up the one on the back and shave against the grain. You receive two shaves in one--it&#x27;s pretty good and you can&#x27;t beat the price for a close shave. So, I give the Eltron 5-stars and call it the best cheap razor on the market today.</li>
    <li> it will do but not much more, the screen has the tendency to grab facial hair and if it is wee bit long it does not cut.</li>
    <li> very good shaver, I got one. Then 3 of my friends got the same.</li>
    <li> Tiny shaver works like the expensive ones.  Trimmer is perfect.</li>
    <li> Powerful little shaver, very portable and perfect for travel - it gives a very close shave, one of the closest I&#x27;ve seen, and the trimmer works well too. The construction is a little bit plasticky and flimsy, but still the shaver delivers the results.</li>
    <li> I keep a shaver handy all the time, hair on my face bothers me...so I shave quit often during the day...</li>
