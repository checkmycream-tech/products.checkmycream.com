      <li>Overall this is an excellent product.  </li>
      <li>I had to rinse my eyes many times to stop the pain.  </li>
      <li>started doing research and read about how Ocusoft lid scrub is used to treat many eye conditions, so I went out and bought the Ocusoft Lid Scrub</li>
      <li>I use them at the office mostly since I always forget to use them at home.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I still get dry eyes at night which resulted from PRK. However, these lid scrubs reduce my dry eyes during the night so I can at least partially open my eyes to find my eye drops.</li>
    <li> My eye doctor recommended I use this produce since I have very dry eyes.  Your&#x27;s is the same product but half the price my doctor charges.  I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> These pads work very well for me and I will continue to use them indefinitely.  They had been recommended by my ophthalmologist.</li>
    <li> I was getting irritating \\&quot;slime\\&quot; in my eyes (one more than the other). I used eye wash, eye drops, rubbing, gentle touches with a clean finger--NOTHING HELPED. I went to the eye doctor and he gave me a sample of OCuSOFT lid scrub wipes. He said he thought the irritation was an allergic reaction to eyelid and eyelash contaminants. I thought he was nuts. The next day I tried it and HE WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!! THESE WIPES IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THE IRRITANT AND LEAVE YOUR EYES SOOTHED AND COOL. AND...AMAZON&#x27;S PRICE WAS GREAT. I GOT TWO BOXES FOR ABOUT $1.50 MORE THAN THE ONE BOX DRUG STORE PRICE!!</li>
    <li> I use these every morning per Dr&#x27;s direction to clean my eyelids.  One side of the cloth is smooth and the other is slighly rough and can be used if your eyelids need a little roughness to get clean.    Great product, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like baby shampoo and a washcloth does, and is handy to take on travel.    I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking buying these here for 2 for [...] when they are usually $10.99 each at [...].  I assumed amazon had the best price, but when they arrived I looked at the receipt and the small package I realized that it was far from a good deal.</li>
    <li> Our eye doctor recommended Occusoft for keeping eyelids clean, and now we wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I tried these for the first time last night. I awoke with my eyelids itching and burning a bit, which happens sometimes when I&#x27;ve used a moisturizer on my face for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m nearing 50, I seem to have dry, flaky skin above my eyes nearly every night. I remembered I had a box of these pads that I&#x27;d bought a few months ago, so I got up and used one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I thought they were too wet - I expected them to be like a moist towlette, which is just barely moist. But this left a lot of liquid around my eyes, and it felt like there was a soapyness to it. Before I was even finished with the second eye, the stinging began. I finished the second eye and the stinging was getting worse, so I leaned over the sink and quickly rinsed both eyes with water. The stinging stopped, I dried my face and went back to bed and flipped on the tv.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe 10-15 minutes later my eyes started to itch a bit, and it felt like the skin around my eyes was now very dry. They kept itching for a while, then I fell asleep.&lt;br /&gt;Got up about 6 hours later and my eyes were fine - no more itching and when I looked in the mirror the skin wasn&#x27;t dry or flaky as I&#x27;d expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know which of the sesquipedalian chemicals caused the stinging (there&#x27;s no alcohol listed), it may have been just been the sodium chloride (salt), but there are SIX cleansers, so it&#x27;s no wonder I felt a soapyness and dryness. Most reviewers seem to like them, so maybe it&#x27;s just my sensitive skin that&#x27;s the problem. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, these may be just what you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;Water&lt;br /&gt;PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate (Surfactant - Cleansing Agent; Surfactant - Solubilizing Agent; EMULSIFYING)&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Tricedeth Sulfate (Surfactant - Cleansing Agent; Surfactant - Emulsifying Agent; FOAMING)&lt;br /&gt;PEG-150 Distearate (Surfactant - Cleansing Agent; Surfactant - Solubilizing Agent)&lt;br /&gt;Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate (Surfactant - Cleansing Agent; Surfactant - Foam Booster)&lt;br /&gt;Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine (Skin-Conditioning Agent - Miscellaneous; Surfactant - Cleansing Agent; Surfactant - Foam Booster)&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Laureth-13 Carboxylate (Surfactant - Cleansing Agent)&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Chloride (Viscosity Increasing Agent - Aqueous)&lt;br /&gt;Quaternium-15 (formaldehyde releaser) - the European Union has determined that this ingredient &amp;#34;may not be safe&amp;#34; in cosmetics.ing Agent - Miscellaneous; Surfactant - Cleansing Agent; Surfactant - Foam Booster) Sodium Laureth-13 Carboxylate (Surfactant - Cleansing Agent) Sodium Chloride (Viscosity Increasing Agent - Aqueous) Quaternium-15 (formaldehyde releaser) - the European Union has determined that this ingredient &amp;#34;may not be safe&amp;#34; in cosmetics.</li>
    <li> My eyes were constantly irritated, scratchy.  I tried eye drops with little success.  I wear glasses and sometimes within a few minutes spots would appear on the inside surface of the glasses.  Where were these spots coming from?  I spoke to my optometrist.  After inspecting my eyes, he said that my tear ducts were clogging.  Sometimes, pressure would build up and they would erupt and squirt small droplets on the inside of my glasses.  He recommended OCuSoft Lid Scrubs Eyelid Cleaner.  I have used this product once each morning for several years now and have found the relief I have been looking for.</li>
    <li> Ocusoft Lid Scrub Pre-Moistened Pads are very convenient to use. They also are great for traveling. I must use them 2-3x a week for lid blepharitis!</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended these. Baby shampoo works, but these feel better on my eyelids once they dry. Perfect for travelling, because they are individually wrapped.</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Well, actually I love it.  It&#x27;s just that I hate buying it because it works so well and I&#x27;m going to probably be using it everyday for the rest of my life.  Since the pad is so big, and has two sides, I actually started to use it as a whole face cleaner and not just for the eyes.  It works well for the eyes, but will burn for a little while if you get too much in them.  It takes a little practice to learn how to use it so that it doesn&#x27;t burn so much.  When I started using it on my face, I got an unexpected result.  I found out that it also clears up your zits!  Overall this is an excellent product.  My eyes feel very fresh after using it, and it has become a must have part of my daily routine where my eyes feel dirty if I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to add that just recently, I had what felt like was a stye about to form on the bottom of my eyelid.  I used this and because of the location of the stye, I got a lot of it in my eye, and it burned like H-E-double hockey sticks.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I used this or not, but I do know that the stye never grew, and in  fact, went away that same day.</li>
    <li> Had itchy red eyes as well as dry eye and my eye Dr recommended warm compresses and these scrub pads twice a day.  They are soothing and have made my eyes feel so much better since they no longer burn itch and he recommended drops for dry eye and my problem is so much better.  The shipping was so fast because I didn&#x27;t know if my drug store carried them. Amazon and US optical were very efficient.  I will order again from amazon..................................................Mary D</li>
    <li> These things are great for cleaning your eye lids and lashes from the build up left by eye drops. I did not realize the impact of the build up on tearing until I spoke with an optometrist.  These wipes really help a lot.</li>
    <li> I use this as I had some eye irritation.  The product helps.  The towelette is moistened is textured and goes a long way.  I rinse after using this product with fresh cool water.</li>
    <li> My doctor told me to use this for eyelid care for blepharitis. No artificial preservatives. Also great to remove makeup at the same time.</li>
    <li> I use these scrubs to help my dry eye symptoms.  They work very well to scrub all the dried gunk off my eyelids.</li>
    <li> My child had a stye in the eye and the ophthalmologist recommended using these twice a day.  They made a huge difference!!!  Warm compresses by themselves did not help nearly as much.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my eye doctor to  avoid eyelid infections.&lt;br /&gt;Works….haven&#x27;t had any lid infections since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;Easy on the eyes…..doesn&#x27;t sting like soap.</li>
    <li> These textured eyelid wipes help keep the eyes clean in general. They can be used to remove eye makeup, residue after sleeping, etc. There&#x27;s an extra-strength version, as well, but we love that Amazon sells both and that we can get these in two-packs at an economical rate.</li>
    <li> These individual medicated eye pads are not cheap, no matter the supplier.  But they are handy, and work well.  So, the only discriminator is the cost  and reliability of the supplier.  I found both here !</li>
    <li> In the past I&#x27;ve had issues with stys and Chalazions.  Six years ago I had a Chalazion surgically removed from my left eye.  The ophthalmologist told me to clean my eyes with baby shampoo to reduce the risk of developing another one.  I did for many years, but last year I developed Chalazion in my right eye.  I tried warm compresses and stopped wearing eye makeup, but it kept growing  and I was worried I&#x27;d have to undergo the surgery again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started doing research and read about how Ocusoft lid scrub is used to treat many eye conditions, so I went out and bought the Ocusoft Lid Scrub Plus.  Within weeks I noticed my Chalazion shrinking and I started wearing eye make up again, and it still kept shrinking (when I wear eye makeup I still clean my eyes with baby shampoo first and then go over it with the Ocusoft).  I saw that the Ocusoft original formal was a little cheaper, so I thought I try it. The original formal works great and I continue to use it (my Chalazion is about 95-98% smaller, and virtually non-existent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find the double pack on Amazon for under $20.00.  The local stores charge around $16.00 for just one box.</li>
    <li> good for makeup and itchy  eyes</li>
    <li> Ocusoft really helps keep conjunctivitis attacks to a minimum for me. If I use it each morning and after being outside for several hours, my eyes are a lot less irritated. Unfortunately, they upped the price from $16.54 to nearly $28. keep shopping.</li>
    <li> doctor recommended love them</li>
    <li> I first began using Ocusoft&#x27;s foam lid cleanser after I was diagnosed as having blepharitis. I purchased the foam at my ophthalmologist&#x27;s office because I was directed to wash my eyelids with it a couple of times a day. Eventually, I found it it was easier and more convenient to use the lid scrubs. I used both the original formula and the extra strength scrub. But, now that the severe symptoms of blepharitis have been overcome through cleansing, warm compresses, and medication, I have continued to use the Original Formula scrubs every morning upon arising to maintain good eyelid health. I&#x27;m happy with the product and the price. As a Prime Member I don&#x27;t pay for shipping.</li>
    <li> I have tried other brands where it is a dry cloth with a bottle of the liquid. This brand and wet towel is so much easier to use. I do not use it for makeup removal, I cannot wear makeup. I have had chronic pink eye &amp; blepharitis since I was a little kid. I was told several times by several doctors to wash my eyes with baby shampoo. That was horrible! It never helped, it burned, very poor advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally an optometrist told me about this product. It helps if I use it right when my eye starts having any symptoms. If I do need to use an antibiotic ointment then I use this product, wash my face, then apply my ointment. It helps my infection clear up so much quicker. I became a vegetarian 7 months ago &amp; have not had an infection since. Which makes sense because chicken, especially, has staphe which is the cause of many eye infections. I do still get dryness &amp; flaking on my eyelids &amp; I still use this product to help. It does not hurt, sting, burn or irritate my skin or eye at all. I have also started using tea tree oil face soap which is helping as well.</li>
    <li> I like the product overall its works great to remove eye makeup but it actually stings a little.  I think I like their leave on formula better, probably due to the fact that its specifically for sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> If you have allergies, sensitive eyes, dry eyes...then you need to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle and effective. I make them last longer by cutting each one into two pieces.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to help combat Blepharitis.  These are very convenient and easy to carry around.  I use them at the office mostly since I always forget to use them at home.  The individual use packets are terrific for the on the go person.</li>
    <li> I never could use this product because it felt like sandpaper around my eyes.  They produced a new version and I have been able to use it.  Please see my review for the new version.</li>
    <li> I live in Tucson Arizona and in the summer the dust makes my eye lids crusty and red. I have tried soaps, makeup removal pads, very hot water and baby shampoo and nothing worked very well.  These pads clean my eyelids very well and I have been having much less trouble with eye lid infections since I started using them. From the first day my eye lids looked cleaner and the redness went away. I have been using these pads for about nine months and I think they are a very effective product.</li>
    <li> My eyes are irritated, become swollen and red. I decided not to use it anymore. Maybe my eyes are too sensitive??</li>
    <li> Occusoft Eyelid Scrub works great to remove eye makeup even water-proof makeup. The pre-moistened pads gently and effectively all trace of any eye makeup and leave the lid feeling clean and refreshed. No tugging or harsh pulling of delicate eyelid skin is needed.</li>
    <li> I had some problems with my eyelid pores clogging up and this product does help. I&#x27;ve got a feeling that a moist toilette product would do just the same, but haven&#x27;t tested that out. Unfortunately the price on Amazon is almost double of the &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; big box store. I keep these with me now for when I do have irritation on my eyelids.</li>
    <li> These pre-moistened pads do NOT take off eye make-up as claimed.  They are soothing to use but any brand moist make-up remover wipes take away eye make-up 90% better than ocusoft..If a product does not live up to its hype...then it&#x27;s a waste of money !</li>
    <li> Use them every night and love them.  They work easily and don&#x27;t bother my eyes at all.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with a chronic eye condition a couple years ago.  As a result, I have to clean my lashes/lids everyday.  The doctor recommended using diluted baby shampoo but it was messy and too harsh on the tender skin around the eyes.  I started using these and I love them!!  They are convenient and easy to use in the shower.  I was very pleased to find them on Amazon at a price about 25% less than the local drugstore.</li>
    <li> Years ago my eye doctor told me to use baby shampoo to scrub my lids.  But if I missed even one day infection showed up.  Then I was given a couple of Ocusoft packets to try.  The big difference was when the samples ran out and no infection set in I began to realize this was worth trying.  So I&#x27;ve been using only these packets for a long time and when I forget even for 2 days, no more infections!  So easy to take when traveling too.  The infection will never entirely heal up but it finally is under control now.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, put in your luggage, cosmetic bag or purse eye cleansing pads that are great to use right before bed.  I love that they&#x27;re individually wrapped which makes them great for travel also.  Just make sure to rinse your eyes after wiping with the Ocusoft.  I use these as they were recommended by my optometrist, but they are also great for taking make-up off too.</li>
    <li> I use these when traveling to remove makeup and clean my eyelids.  I have had trouble with stys on my eyelids but haven&#x27;t gotten any since using these nightly.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it does a fabulous job removing eye makeup and it is soothing and thorough.  Thanks, Amazon</li>
    <li> My eyes were frequently red around the rims, and it didn&#x27;t seem to be related to some common malady that sometimes seems flaky, like dandruff.  Maybe it was eye strain; maybe it&#x27;s from too much t.v., computer, and other devices.  Maybe even from Aging?  Nevertheless, using these pads from time-to-time helped take the red away.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised will buy again</li>
    <li> Returned this item as it was much too small - will get a larger size later on as I have to continue use it to make sure my eyes are properly washed out each morning after using Lumigan for protection after surgery.</li>
    <li> Exactly like what you get in stores, just cheaper. I love me some cheaper!  These help me keep my eyes clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using baby shampoo and a washcloth to do the same job and can&#x27;t say there is any difference in the results or any improvement.</li>
    <li> Have not had irritated eyes since I started using OcuSoft. Pads are a little on the rough side, so use them carefully w/o applying too much pressure.</li>
    <li> My eye doctor recommended this product to me to keep my eye lashes and eye lids clean He found that my eyes around the lashes were red. I use one every other day or more frequent if my eyes are &#x27;burning&#x27;. They work very well and are absolutely worth the expense. Of course, Amazon&#x27;s shipping is truly &#x27;no hassle&#x27; and on time or before.</li>
    <li> Eyes would get red and hurt.  Thought it was a dry eyes problem.  Had used many over the counter dry eyes problem.  Not working that great even though they did help.  Tried these and it is great.  Now they eyes are not red and don&#x27;t hurt.  It wasn&#x27;t dry eyes after all.  Have since learned that bacteria on eyelids can cause some people to have red eyes that burn.</li>
    <li> So far.. I think they are working.  Convienent to order 3 boxes at at time..since I use one everyday.  Need to find the moisturizer to go with it.</li>
    <li> I use these on my daughter, who is prone to getting chalazions...  These clear them up pretty quick...  I go for the \\&quot;plus\\&quot; OCuSoft when they seem a little more stubborn and those are JUST amazing...  Amazon won&#x27;t ship those where I live though and they are VERY expensive...about double the price of Amazon...and hard to find...but for the most part, these do the trick and are just a Godsend...  LOVE the two-pack!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record...  I&#x27;ve tried other \\&quot;eyelid cleansing pads\\&quot; when I couldn&#x27;t find OCuSoft and they just...don&#x27;t...work.  Whoever concocted the cleansing formula for these REALLY knew what in the world they were doing :)</li>
    <li> These pre package pads that have lid scrub liquid on them are very convenient to use.  Great when traveling or in a hurry.  The lid scrub works great!</li>
    <li> Works perfect for me. Totally satisfy with product. Exactly what I was looking for. Recommend to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> My Eye Dr. gave me samples, love OCuSoft pads.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to everyone who wears contacts.&lt;br /&gt;Glad you sell them.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to chemicals, fragrances, many soaps etc. I was worried I would be allergic to this but was desperate to find something to help my gritty oily eyelids. My soap and water would burn my eyes and make them red because in order to get the oils and grit off near my eyelashes I would inevitably get the soap into my eyes. I tried one of these pads first on one eye in case I was allergic. I was not allergic and in fact the skin around my eye felt so silky soft after using this product so the next day I used it on both sides. My eyes have not felt so well in years. This gets rid of the oily grit but does not burn or sting, I don&#x27;t think it is getting into my eyes at all and still it is cleansing the lash area. People who wear eyeglasses are more likely to get oily gritty eyelid problems it has something to do with the glasses not allowing proper air flow around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;These pads are expensive for daily use and as some have said you might try cutting the little pads into and making them last longer. There is a foamy liquid made by ocusoft but I have not tried it, some people say it is not as good as these pads maybe because the pad not only contains the mild soapy product but also the pad is textured to allow a gentle scrubbing effect. They are easy to use, just open the packet remove the pad, clean eyelids, rinse with lukewarm water, pat dry and gritty oils are gone.&lt;br /&gt;If you have eyelid problems I recommend giving these a try, I am glad to have them.</li>
    <li> same as always - we use these regularly</li>
    <li> My eyes kept tearing.  Went to 5 eye doctors.  Finally one recommend I use this product 2 times a day.  With eye drops for allergy and cleaning my eye lids, I no longer have the water build up in eyes.  Problem, the price is too high for just 30 wipes.  They are very tiny strips. Cvs doesn&#x27;t even carry them anymore. Co. Should lower the price.  Good for cleaning the whole eye area if it were larger and less expensive.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and as described.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to clean off eye make-up and prevent eye lid problems.  The individual packs are easy to use for travel.</li>
    <li> My husband has chronic clogging in where his thick eyelashes grow. He goes into an ophthalmologist at least three times a year when they are excruciating and require antibiotics. I did a little research and came across these. While they are not 100% prevented, the styes are easily treated with these pads and clear up faster than hot compresses and medicine alone. I went ahead and purchased the extra strength ones to see if they might be a little better with preventing flare ups.</li>
    <li> There are tiny oil ducts just inside one&#x27;s eyelashes that produce a layer of oil that prevents tears from evaporating quickly.  Clogging of these oil ducts is very often the cause of dry eyes.    My optometrist examined my oil ducts under magnification and said most of them were clogged.  He recommended lid scrubbing just inside the lash line to clear the clogs and said this product is acceptable for that use.    I close my eyes, then rub gently with one of these pads between the upper and lower lashes, then splash with water to rinse.    It took a couple weeks to clear out enough plugs to get good results.    To reduce the cost, I cut each lid scrub pad into 4 sections and store 3 sections for use on subsequent days.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for my blepharitis.  Pads are strong and work great to remove &amp;#34;gook&amp;#34; that gathers on eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Usually get these at Walmart, but they seem to be out-of-stock too often. They offer a house brand, but they&#x27;re often out as well. The amazon.com 2-pk is no savings over Walmart, but now I have a supply &amp; don&#x27;t have to think about where to get them.</li>
    <li> It really cleans the eyelids and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting in your eyes.  It easy to use.  The only negative is that I used these twice a day and so I often run out and it can be very expensive to maintain buying more.  Even though I can used baby shampoo, but believe it or not, it stings, even though it says no more tears.  I would rather use this product.  The product always delivers on time and I have no problem with it.</li>
    <li> A sample of Ocusoft lid scrub pads was given to me by the eye doctor.  He told me my lids were crusted and that was the problem I was having.  Using this every morning has been very helpful and I purchased a few boxes to make sure they are always on hand when I need them.  They do not irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have frequent issues with my eyes. These pads were recommended by an optometrist. They are handy since they can be tossed in a handbag or travel bag and do an excellent job of clearning your eyelids.</li>
    <li> Great to package and carry with you.  Really have noticed improved in the eyelid area - less irritation and lids are gently scrubbd clean.</li>
    <li> My ophthalmologist told me I had to carefully clean my eyelids to treat blepharitis; these pads have really helped the condition, and I&#x27;m happy I found them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I use these every day.  Easy to use, and gets the job done.  I would reccomend these to those in need to help clean their eye lids.</li>
    <li> I have a slight problem with my eyes tearing--especially at night.  My eye doctor suggested I try these.  The are gentle and soothing on the skin and help to remove the crusted tears that accumulate on my eyelids.</li>
    <li> I was first made aware of these from my eye doctor, because I was always getting little infections around my lashes.  He told me these would work and I was skeptical - they just seemed like make-up removal pads.  Nevertheless, after using them twice a day my eyes cleared up.  I get these infections often so I invested in more, and haven&#x27;t regretted it a bit.  The price here is the best price I have been able to find.</li>
    <li> These are great. I use them multiple times before tossing them. Wish the packet was recloseable because they dry up.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve had itchy and sometimes inflamed eyes and using this product has been extremely helpful in correcting my problem.  And with immediate results!  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My eye doc suggested getting OCuSOFT pads for my inflammed eye lids. I&#x27;ve been using them for about a month and can see the difference.</li>
    <li> I can not use these consitently as they then dry my eyelids out. However I do use them on occasion to relieve irritation. Love them when they work. Hate them when I end up with dry patches on my eyelids.</li>
    <li> I used this product for several weeks twice a day before cataract surgery at the request of the eye doctor.  I found it very easy to use, simple instructions.  Sealed pouches are easy to tear open and each wipe is a single use.</li>
    <li> The product is perfect for me.  I use it each evening to keep from getting eye infection caused by bacteria on eye lid.</li>
    <li> This is avery good product that was recommended by the eye doctor. It is expensive but worth it if you need it.</li>
    <li> I have naturally long eye lashes which catch all sorts of junk which is floating around in the air thus causing irritation to my eyes. My ophthalmologist recommended this product and it is very refreshing and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. My husband had an eye irratation that looked like a sty might be forming. The first time he used the pad, the eye irratation cleared! It was almost like a miracle. Now we both use the pads as needed  with excellent results.</li>
    <li> Ocusoft Lid Scrub is a miracle product!  I would not be able to wear contact lenses without this product.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and Ocusoft is head and shoulders above the rest.  My eyes were often irritated and dry prior to using Ocusoft, but now I can wear my contact lenses comfortably all day long.  I use this product daily and would recommend it to any contact lens wearer with dry or irritated eyes.</li>
    <li> This is a product recommended by my Eye Doctor.  They are so easy to use and do a thorough job of cleansing my eyelids.  Definitely no sting from the sudsy ingredients, and my eyes rinse off perfectly after use.  An excellent product for daily use, or to keep for special times when the eyes are irritated.</li>
    <li> Regular use of this product moistens chronic dry-eye, cleans eyelids, removes oil from hair shafts, prevents eye mucus formation and eye infection.</li>
    <li> This is a utility item that I buy as needed. My opthamologist recommended it, and I have used OCusoft for years.</li>
    <li> My opthomologist suggested these for morning use -They really help!!</li>
    <li> I had starting having major eye problems, dry red eyes to the point my eyes hurt and burned all the time, even seeing spots and floaters in my vision. Had tried various drops, cold compresses, even thought it was too much time on the computer, cut back on the computer at home, nothing worked. Went to the eye doctor, they told me I had lots of surface bacteria on my eyes, they recommended this. I thought it&#x27;s not my eyelids but I was so wrong! Within 2 days of using them, my eyes are back to normal. I cut one in two for both eyes since they are very expensive but worth the price to be able to see clearly again. My eyes no longer feel as dry and have also noticed that my eyelids do not look as puffy.  This product really works!</li>
    <li> I used to have eyelid stye all the time until my doctor told me to starting using this cleaning pad everyday. Now it has reduced the occurance of style by 80%, I rarely gets one now. The bonus part is that you can also use it to clean your face, and no more black head too on nose</li>
    <li> I believe I have found the root cause of my dry eye problems - clogged eyelid pores.  These cleansing pads seem to do the trick - I use them every morning.</li>
    <li> My ophthalmologist told me to use these twice a day. They really work and make your eyelids feel so much better. I have very dry eyes and eye lid disease, so they got a bit expensive, but I got on a forum and someone suggested cutting them in half, putting the other half back into the individual packet, and put in a ziplock. So I do that and they are plenty big enough to do that and saves me a lot of $$.</li>
    <li> I use these every night to remove my eye make up. They&lt;br /&gt;do the trick and are safe for any eye allergy you may have.</li>
    <li> Bought these and found that some had more soap than others.  Ended up buying CVS store brand and found more consistency with them for less money.</li>
    <li> I use the foam daily to sooth irritated eyelids related to high-count pollen days and dryness. It is very soothing, non-greasy, non-alcoholic. I use these pads when I travel.</li>
    <li> Very good for cleaning the eyes on dusty days or for any reason. They clean the eyelid lashes to help prevent itchy eyes.</li>
    <li> These work great for cleaning your eyelids. I take one sheet and cut into 8 equal sized squares. I find that this reduced size works just fine for me. That way, one package can last for 8 applications.</li>
    <li> There is nothing wrong with these pads per se but a nuisance to use. I tore open the package and tried to wrap the pad around my finger, as instructed. It did not stay around the finger very long but no big deal as there is enough pad to just hold it and do the wiping. The nuisance part is that now you are instructed to rinse thoroughly and then do the other eye. I really don&#x27;t see the point. If I have to thoroughly rinse after use why not just thoroughly rinse to begin with?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the other reviews it seems that there is an improved version. So, I went ahead and got the improved version and it makes more sense. You clean the eyelids and don&#x27;t rinse. Makes more sense but costs a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend these pads because if they have any benefits you will rinse them off so you might just as well rinse to start with and forget the pads. However, if you can&#x27;t remove eyelid gunk with just plain rinsing and you don&#x27;t need any of the benefits provided by the upgraded version you can give these a try .</li>
    <li> The best product of its type, I love it. I like the slightly rough texture because it captures eyelid debris much better than if it were smooth. I also like the ingredients of this better than other brands, because some other brands have alcohol, yikes; and other brands have too many chemicals.</li>
    <li> I purchased these on the recommendation of my ophthalmologist who had given me a sample of one packet.  The instructions were to apply a warm moistened washcloth to my (closed) eyes and then to cleanse the eyelids with the Ocusoft Lid Scrub, all with the aim of keeping my eyes from itching from dryness later in the day.  I have been doing this off and on, and I do not notice much of a difference between standing under a warm shower that bathes my closed eyes and using the wipes or not using them and/or doing the warm compress plus wipes exercise.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive eyes and need to scrub my lids with baby shampoo.  I like these pads because they are so convenient for travel.</li>
    <li> These are great for taking off your make-up. I like that they are made by an \\&quot;eye care\\&quot; company and not a make-up company. I have bought them for years from Wal-mart, but love getting them from Amazon and saving myself the trip.</li>
    <li> Great makeup remover pads.</li>
    <li> I use these wipes as part of my daily routine as I have blepheritis.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with my eyes... they were red and itchy pretty much all the time for about a year.  I went to several doctors and ended up only receiving prescriptions for allergy eye drops, but the problem persisted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I went to an eye doctor for the yearly exam, mentioned the itchy eye problem, and was told, \\&quot;use these to clean your eyelids AND take allergy eye drops\\&quot;.  Worked like a charm.  I&#x27;ve been free of red, itchy eyes for 2 years now, using these lid scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically I think that something that I put in my hair (either the styling cream or the thinning hair treatment) slowly leaks into my eyes, carried invisibly by the oils that my skin produces.  Or maybe it&#x27;s just the oil from my skin.  Whatever the case, these lid scrubs prevent the problem from occurring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product.  I just wish that the FIRST doctor I visited had known of these!</li>
    <li> I have a long family history of eye problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take it from me, this is as good an eyelid cleanser as you&#x27;ll find. These wipes may seem less economical than the foam sprays, but trust me they are more affordable. The foam sprays lose their reactivity after 70 percent through the bottle, and often the spray head is worn out by then and also the foam comes out in a useless liquid. Plus, these wipes don&#x27;t have the highly corrosive chemistry that the foams have. They are gentle, and although they don&#x27;t have the clean sensation that accompanies something that is burning your flesh, they do a better job removing eye buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy one pack and test them out, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Eye doctor suggests that I use these every night to keep my eye crud under control.  This  price, with free shipping, was the most competitive.  Wish that someone would start selling them in bulk.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from Blepharitis this is the solution, period. Cut each pad into three long strips. Use one strip and put the other two back in the envelope. Wet the eyelids with water before using the scrub. After use, rinse the eye thoroughly using an eyecup or just place water into your cupped hands over and over for at least six rinses. Secure the top from air with a paper clip. Use three times a day. Send $100 to my office. Just kidding.</li>
    <li> These are, hands down, the best eyelid scrubbing pads out there. If you have dry eyes or blepharitis, they work perfectly. They don&#x27;t sting, and they&#x27;re not too rough. One side is more &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; than the other, so you can choose which one works for you.</li>
    <li> Watch the cost of this product. You can buy the individual items for $11.28. 2 for 22.56. Cost is my only complaint.</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands and different kind of lid scrubs. These work the best. They are easy to use and do the job.</li>
    <li> I was experiencing severe eye pain at night. By extreme, I mean I couldn&#x27;t sleep and I was afraid of what it would mean if the pain got any worse. The ophthalmologist ($250 for the visit) offered to do surgery on my eyelids. If you&#x27;re a Radiohead fan, you understand why I balked at this idea. Then I figured: Well, these eyelid cleany wipey thingies probably couldn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eye pain is has almost completely remitted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve had the lasic, or if you just have dry and/or irritated eyes, it&#x27;s worth it to give these little wipes a try. If you&#x27;ve got eye pain, you know that it makes you miserable. Before scalpels or punctal plugs or any of that, see if these help.</li>
    <li> I tried these because they are cheaper than the same wipes (same brand) that come in a lighter blue box. I use these everyday during allergy season-if I don&#x27;t my eyes swell, itch, tear like crazy, and I get stys. My eye issues are my only serious allergy symptom so using these better than taking a pill everyday (imo). However, these ones require rinsing so are not as quick and sting my eyes more that the &amp;#34;leave on&amp;#34; version of these in the light blue box.</li>
    <li> easy to work with and does seem to help at times with my weird vision to make me feel a lot more comfortable.</li>
    <li> My ophthalmologist told me about them when I had allergy symptoms. I use them every night and they help with dryness too. A must for seasonal allergy and dry eye suffers.</li>
    <li> I found the pads a little harsh.  I ordered the foam and it works much better and is gentler on the eyelids.</li>
    <li> Thrilling as it is to see all of the happy customers, I don&#x27;t get it. I don&#x27;t need this product to remove eye makeup, but the doc recommended it for dry eyes. So I put it on and then rinse it off. Wouldn&#x27;t just the rinse do the same thing? And, if you have to rinse thoroughly after applying it, aren&#x27;t you just rinsing off the product you just applied? I titled this review \\&quot;I don&#x27;t get it\\&quot; purposely because someone out there might explain to me what I have wrong!</li>
    <li> I used to get styes in my eyes on a regular basis.  I started using these pads to wash my eyes once daily (first thing in the morning per my doctor&#x27;s recommendation) and have essentially eliminated the problem.  Well worth the $10 or so $&#x27;s per month I have to pay for these things.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my eye doc.  Easy to use.  Keeps down potential bacteria in the eyes.</li>
    <li> Met expectations well and we have reordered this product. The double package is a good deal.</li>
    <li> These eye cleansing pads can be easily halved to increase their usage.  I cut them in half when I open a pack and keep the unused portion in the package where it is ready for use later, no problems.  Soft and the cleansing agent is totally non-irritating to the eye.  One of those necessary products that just simply does it&#x27;s job quietly and without drama - what can one say, they work!</li>
    <li> These products were recommended to a friend by her doctor, when she went in to see why she was repeatedly getting styes. With nightly use, the pads eliminated the styes. As a bonus, my friend discovered they are excellent at makeup removal, particularly water resistant mascara and eye liner.</li>
    <li> I bought these and like them for travel use but much prefer the foam cleanser. Very easy to use. My mom loves them.</li>
    <li> I have dry eyes as a result of cataract surgery. These do a great job of cleaning out the residue from frequent applications of eye drops.</li>
    <li> Since I began using these to clean my eyelids, eyelashes, and those ugly corners of both eyes first thing in the morning , my eyes reward me all day.</li>
    <li> This product was prescribed by my eye doctor. It is a great product and I expect I will be using it for a long time.</li>
    <li> My opthamologist suggested this product to me because of my dry eyes. I have used the pads and really like them. They are good for removing my makeup from my eyes and lids.</li>
    <li> my wife likes his product. cleans well, reasonably priced, not at all irritating even though my wife has sensitive skin</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for cleaning your eyelids.  It makes you eyes feel refreshed and it does not need to be wiped off when you use them.  Some other products have to been cleaned after you wipe you lids.</li>
    <li> The Pre-moistened Pads work well. Feel refreshing to the eye / eye lid. We have used these twice daily for several months and will be ordering more soon. Very good product.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I have discovered this wonderful product! I had a chalazion under one of my eyes for about a year. It looks like a sty that would not go away! I went to an eye doctor to have it removed and he recommended this product to me. I am so glad he did! After I started using ocusoft little by little my chalazion was going down in size and then completely went away. No surgery needed!!!! I would recommend it to anybody. Love love love this product!</li>
    <li> I had a terrible ordeal with the worst allergy eyes you can imagine three years ago.  My eye specialist recommended that I try baby shampoo or this product.  Tried the shampoo but it made my eyes worse so I purchased Ocusoft original.  What can I say but WOW - these immediately helped and I have been using this ever since. I use a eye wash with no preservatives and also these pads - how great it is to not have the burning, red, and watery eyes! Thank you Ocusoft!!!!</li>
    <li> These are great to have when you don&#x27;t have time to use their foam scrub, like when you are camping. Recommended by my eye doc to avoid/cure styes. Make sure you get under the lid where othe tear ducts are located. Much cheaper here than at the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> My doc recommended this product to clean the edges and insides of my eyelids due to chronic inflammation (Belpharitis). They seem to have helped to reduce the redness and itching inside, and my husband swears that they have made a huge difference to him. Recommended to try and see if it works for you for whatever purpose!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for 10 years.  It has helped with my dry eyes and eye Rocesa problems.  Clean eye lids are very important in maintaining this disease and dry eye problems.  The product is very safe on my eye lids as well.  Washing with other eye products had caused inflamation to my eye lids.  I use this product twice a day without any problems to my eye lids and of course much improvent to my actual eyes.  I appreciate that this product being offered through Amazon.  Since I use this product so much, I appreciate the reduced price on line as versus my local drug store price.</li>
    <li> While these do the job without burning, you must rinse the suds off.  If I am going to have to rinse my eyelids anyway, why even bother with the pre-moistened pads?</li>
    <li> These helped my eyes a lot and my eye doctor suggested staying on them. She suggested, by the way, using them at night when the eyelids become dirtiest. No irritation or any other negative effects occurred. They are a bit expensive, but if you&#x27;re having eye problems I recommend buying them anyway. They&#x27;re also available in a stronger version.</li>
    <li> I have used Ocusoft Plus pads in the past and love them.  They have helped with my ocular rosacea so much. I had never had a problem and they made my eyes feel great. I ordered these by accident but thought that would give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH MY GOSH!  The first time I used them my eyes started stinging like I had gotten soap in them.  I had to rinse my eyes many times to stop the pain.  Tried them one more time, being more careful to keep my eyes shut tight and it still stung.  I am really surprised there is such a difference between the two Ocusoft Products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will return to using Ocusoft Plus.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent non-prescription product for cleaning lids. I&#x27;ve had a medical problem there and this product has helped clean the eye lids well enough to show great improvement. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone needing something for eyelids.</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly - twice or three times a week to clean my eye lids. It feels great. No product in Europe is able to compete with it</li>
    <li> These pads work &amp;#34;as advertised&amp;#34;.</li>
