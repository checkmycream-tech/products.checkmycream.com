    <li> Thank you just as described.</li>
    <li> My husbands insurance charges $12.00 PER FILTER. Exact same filter required for his CPAP machine. Excellent price!!!</li>
    <li> Great to find an alternative to the 2 for five dollars at the Doctors.</li>
    <li> The product is fine and is original - it comes in barcoded OEM packaging. Just make sure you order the correct size. There are similar products that need to be cut to size.</li>
    <li> Good quality and one heck of a lot cheaper price than what my usual supplier charges.</li>
    <li> Not sure what I was going to receive but was pleasantly surprised when I got original replacement filters. Very happy</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and could not fine locally.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the lowest price</li>

    <li> great price perfect fit</li>
    <li> Fine and I should have checked my CPAP model so as to order the correct one.</li>
    <li> just what it says,great</li>
    <li> These filters are just like what I get from the doctor, but are much cheaper, and of course, so much easier to obtain.</li>
    <li> These foam filters fit the BiPap machine to a tee and are much more reasonably priced than ordering through my normal respiratory care provider. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Fits and works as it should.  They send you more then you will ever need since these are washable and you can use them over and over.</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I ordered &amp; very quickly. These are great replacement filters for our CPAP machine. Great buy</li>
    <li> Identical product at fraction of the cost compared to the companies setting up C-PAP machines</li>
    <li> Wow these came in a 12 pack. The cost is very reasonable. These are the same size as the ones from my medical supply company and fit my machine perfectly. I am so glad to find them.</li>
    <li> This filters is same as original .Perfect fit .Save you lot of money</li>
    <li> These foam filters were just what I would expect in a good replacement filter.  The price was great compared to the local medical supply companies.</li>
    <li> Arrived shortly after order was placed, exactly what I needed, and super cheap to boot. I&#x27;ve always thought about maybe buying a strip from home depot and cutting it myself just to save a few bucks, but at only a few bucks for a pack of 10, couldn&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> makes a huge difference having good clean filters in my CPAP. And these cost a lot less than the sleep center charges for theirs.</li>
    <li> They work. They are well-packaged to be put away until needed--a whole year&#x27;s set in one plastic bag, and since I paid for them, no hassle from the insurance. Cheap and good. What else is there to say?</li>
    <li> The foam filters are exactly what&#x27;s advertised. I have enough replacements that I can throw them away as they tear.</li>
    <li> The reusable black foam filters that I purchased were identical in quality to the type that I used to purchase from my home respiratory company.  The price was very reasonable and I expect that I will be able to use and reuse the set of 12 for the next year or so.</li>
    <li> Perfect, arrived on time, original equipment.  Good buy!</li>
    <li> They work fine and are a bargin.</li>
    <li> I have just started using my CPAP machine and finding out how the &amp;#34;Medical field&#x27; are out to get into your pocket. I went to buy some replacement filters and without even blinking the supplier said the 2 foam replacements would cost me $30.00. I turned around and walked out and am so glad I did. The interesting thing is the filters I found at Respironics were made by the same manufacture as the filters I was going to buy from the local supplier. Thank you Respironics!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and what my supplier have new.</li>
    <li> Visually comparing these to the ones that originally came with my my cpap machine, they appear to be exactly the same size.  They fit right into the slot in the back and stayed there all night.  I suppose the air flow sucks them into place and keeps them there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can&#x27;t speak to the &amp;#34;density&amp;#34; issue about which some other reviewers are complaining, I will say I see no reason why, if you use them with the white paper filters, that the two of them won&#x27;t stop any airborne particles that might get into to the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the price!  My cpap rental company charged me $10 for ONE FILTER!  They say that they are washable, but at the price for these replacements (I payed $5 for 12) I could throw one away each month and still come out ahead.</li>
    <li> As good or better than most. Easy to install and you could clean them if you wanted to.</li>
    <li> These are the same as what I get through my health provider but at about a fifth of the price (and I&#x27;m paying 20% of the total cost according to the health plan.)</li>
    <li> works as expected,  I do not see any problems with these.  Nice to have extras around.  The price is good and great service.</li>
    <li> Great price great quality !</li>
    <li> I am starting see Amazon suppliers offer more and more CPAP supplies , often much less than I can buy them through my home medical supply comapnay and more reliable delivery. As an example my HMO required that I purchase my CPAP supplies through one of four vendors - I tried to get a new mask in Novemver to find out in December that  the company I contacted was no longer a supplier for my HMO. The process started again with a new supplier (they needed sleep studies and all sorts of paper work not really needed and here it is February of the following year and I am yet to get anything from the new supplier. including the filters for my CPAP machine. Maybe the medical system is pricing itself out of business - no matter what , I am very pleased to be able to purchase my supplys at a reasonable cost</li>
    <li> Look and fit just like the old ones, and came packaged in pairs which is convenient; bottom line, I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
    <li> The filters allow me to simplify my regular bi-pap maintenance routine -- by allowing to simply swap out both filters at the same time.</li>
    <li> Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a reason you get 12 filters for the low price!  Very thin and smelled &amp;#34;chemical like&amp;#34;.  I should have washed the filter first as I breathed in that chemical smell the first night.  Had a headache in the morning. Wondering what I was actually breathing in??? They said they were new, but I&#x27;m not sure.  I&#x27;m used to the thicker Res Med filters and will go back to those again and will pay whatever price they are.  I was suspect when they cam shipped in a plastic bag with no manufacturer&#x27;s label on them.</li>
    <li> arrived on time and worked as described!</li>
    <li> i was super pleased, after getting these filters. they are better than what my sleep center sells. these are the real deal</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t as thick as the ones from my cpap company - on the other hand, they cost 10 times less than my insurance co-pay and I can replace them more often - I only get two a year via my insurance. The quality is plenty fine and the cost is terrific</li>
    <li> Respironics are great products.</li>
    <li> This product meets all my expectations and more and is very fairly priced. Would recommend this to anyone needing these filters for their Respironics  CPAP machine.</li>
    <li> Great replace not filter for my machine!</li>
    <li> Work great in my machine.  My insurance only pays for one every 6 months but I like to change it more frequently and I don&#x27;t always do it first think in the morning.  This assures that I always have a clean/dry one at all times.</li>
    <li> Great product. .. fast shipping!</li>
    <li> a perfect replacement match.  thank you!</li>
    <li> 1 3/4&amp;#34; by 3/8&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is so much cheaper than ResMed wants. Fits perfect Packaged properly</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe my insurance co-pay is $5.00 for ONE of these little sponge filters, and I get a bag full of filters, for slightly more ,from the AG Industries !!!  Close enough match for me !!!</li>
    <li> Great prices. Thank you</li>
    <li> The filters are ok but the description says a pack of 12.  I received only 6.</li>
    <li> I was getting tired of not being able to get more than one filter at a time from my supplier.&lt;br /&gt;I found these online, they are a quality product and at a very nice price.&lt;br /&gt;Very Pleased</li>
    <li> Great value, happy, happy, happy!</li>
    <li> Perfect options to keep on hand when your CPAP supplies run low because your DME hasnt shipped you a new supply. Works great on the Respironics System One PR60 - no issues, almost looks like OEM, if not its OEM.</li>
    <li> These filters fit perfect and are a great buy. I bought 2 from Apria Co. last year and they cost more than all 12 of these.</li>
    <li> Excellent value - OEM parts</li>
    <li> These filters fit my cpap machine and were alot cheaper than the ones I was buying</li>
    <li> These filters are exactly 1-11/16&amp;#34; long X 15/16&amp;#34; wide X 3/8&amp;#34; thick.  They fit perfectly in my machine.</li>
    <li> Great product. .. fast shipping!  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Nice Price, they worked just fine.</li>
    <li> Fits my machine and filters the air (Respironics M Series)</li>
    <li> These cost 18.00 per filter at local medical store!&lt;br /&gt;These are great, at a great price!</li>
    <li> Received on time. Filters fit</li>
    <li> This seems to do the job very well and for the amount of them you get for the price it is just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Exactly the same as my medical supplier had been providing but at a significantly lower cost.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect size for my husband&#x27;s CPAP machine.  These filters work well, to prevent dust and contaminants from getting into the CPAP unit.</li>
    <li> These are MUCH cheaper than the amount I pay after insurance - I have skipped the middle mad and purchased these same filters for a lot less money</li>
    <li> : Reusable Foam Filters for Respironics M Series Machines - Set of 12 (Health and Beauty)These Cpap filters are perfect and they are of good quality.  I was very impressed when I received them very quickly! These fit nicely in my machine. Great seller!</li>

    <li> nice packaging by 2&#x27;s. exactly how i wanted it.  I really appreciate that the bulk order didnt came by 12&#x27;s which allow the other stocck replacement be exposed to dirt even before used.</li>
    <li> These foam filters were exactly what I needed and expected</li>
    <li> Very nice, just like from the med supply store, except cheaper and withput the hassle.</li>
    <li> Better information needed on the dimensions.  These are too small for the older repironics CPAP machhine.  I will use more of them to make up for the filters being too small.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  So much cheaper (vs. prices the docs charge me) for the same product - yeah!</li>
    <li> Good price considering what a durable medical equipment company would sell it for.</li>
    <li> Great products and they arrived sooner than expected. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for phillips cpap</li>
    <li> The foam filters are not the density necessary.  The foam filters are not as dense and not as thick as are the ones from Respironics.</li>
    <li> So easy to change out and to clean.</li>
    <li> good value use for week and pitch</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and as described.</li>
    <li> Exactly the right foam for my Responics M series CPAP machine. Fit is great and foam is soft and pliable so that it fits in the corners better than my last filter</li>
    <li> So many filters for such a low price, quality product made in the U.S. Don&#x27;t hesitate, purchase these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me rambling:&lt;br /&gt;If you were prescribed any kind of machine that uses these filters, don&#x27;t let the provider company repeatedly bill your insurance to send you new equipment absurdly marked up and required you an insane co-pay. My company is a reputable company, they provide excellent equipment, but after billing my insurance expected me to pay $120 co-pay for ONE of both kinds of filters, a new hose, a new mask, and a new soft-gel. A little less than half of that if you only request new filters (which again, is only one of the ultrafine, and one of the black sponge). On Amazon I found all products for less than $70. The mask at $40 was the most expensive, and was only purchased with the hose for an emergency backup. The filters together were less than $20 and both came with 6 each, so I have a year&#x27;s supply for $20 compared to the $40 monthly my CPAP&#x27;s provider wanted to charge. And yes, I did the research, the filters from that company are made from a 3rd party company in the U.S. just like these are.</li>
    <li> Failed to look at the specs.  This size not for my machine, but gave them to a neighbor who has the machine that uses these filters.</li>
    <li> Although from Amazon&#x27;s website, it didn&#x27;t look like this would fit my Respironics REMstar Pro, it fits perfect.  Nice price too.</li>
    <li> I can get the equipment I need for my system one cpap machine at a lower price without using my insurance</li>
    <li> great price great item</li>
    <li> When it was covered by insurance, I was paying more for this.  I wish I had known before!  These filters do a great job with dust and pollen if you are using your machine every night like me.</li>
