### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s freaking perfect.</li>
      <li>The container is the best part of the product.</li>
      <li>The best part about these is nobody else will put their grubby paws into my jelly bean jar, now!</li>
      <li>The best thing to do with these is to eat off the candy coating and spit out the inside.</li>
      <li>Send in the Video to AFV, might win.</li>
      <li>The tin is great and being a lover of tasty salty pig parts</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit that they are a great gag gift, but there is no bacon flavor in the jelly bean.  </li>
      <li>Those are great.</li>
      <li>It takes forever to get the taste from your mouth and they are great to put in the office candy jar and wait for unsuspecting  victims to eat one...</li>
      <li>In a fairness to the company I will have to say they delivered the product very quickly and the packaging is wonderful!</li>
      <li>My husband loved these.  </li>
      <li>He loved them &amp; shared with his family.  </li>
      <li>so I put these in his Xmas stocking and he loved it.  </li>
      <li>Good prank.</li>
      <li>I loved the packaging.  </li>
      <li>I loved the tin these came in.  </li>
      <li>I immediately liked them.</li>
      <li>So, if you collect tins, it&#x27;s spectacular.  </li>
      <li>It was a nice addition to our everything bacon gift basket.</li>
      <li>it is the most DISGUISTING thing I have ever tasted.</li>
      <li>It was more of a cinnamon it seemed to me.</li>
      <li>It has more of as after taste of Nyquil than bacon.  </li>
      <li>Sure it had the hint of a bacon flavor, but by no means should it be confuced with bacon.</li>
      <li>I love bacon.  </li>
      <li>LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>More like ashtray and refried beans.</li>
      <li>I personally love it.</li>
      <li>It has a hint of liquid smoke, but mostly tastes like molten asbestos.</li>
      <li>kids said they were ok</li>
      <li>These can&#x27;t be anything more than a gag joke.</li>
      <li>I am sure that to some this product tastes like bacon - BUT - to me and all the people that I have let try ths product</li>
      <li>It makes a great gag gift, if you really want people to gag.</li>
      <li>In fact, I hopped on Amazon to see if I could find more...</li>
      <li>The tin looks cool, and it&#x27;s great fun to offer to friends.</li>
      <li>The tin is amazing cool.</li>
      <li>own kids expressed an interest in trying them when they arrived, so I got to experience these first hand.</li>
      <li>No one I know would eat more than one, and most would spit out the first as soon as they bit into it.</li>
      <li>think these do a pretty good job of hitting the right flavor, but I had a problem with the jelly inside of the candy</li>
      <li>After all, real bacon kind of has that taste, doesn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The tin was worth the price, but the flavor was the part that became the literal Gag!  </li>
      <li>These are interesting and fun to pass around to a group, but I haven&#x27;t met anyone yet who wants more than one.</li>
      <li>I was excited to see what bacon jellybeans might taste like</li>
      <li>/&gt;The only redeeming quality is the nice tin that the beans come in.</li>
      <li>Actually, my grandson loved the Jelly Beans.</li>
      <li>The tin they come in is really cool though, and that&#x27;s what earned the two stars.</li>
      <li>I like the smoky start and the sweet finish of these jelly beans.  </li>
      <li>Once you&#x27;re done with them, you&#x27;ll probably want to keep the cool tin.</li>
      <li>I was apprehensive, because the aroma that wafted up to greet my nostrils kind of smelled like old band aids.  </li>
      <li>Great but small amount</li>
      <li>As I popped one in my mouth, the first thing I tasted was burnt hair smells like.</li>
      <li>My first thought of the taste of these beans was \\&quot;burning building.\\</li>
      <li>Smelled exactly like bacon, but tasted like it is for chemical cleaning</li>
      <li>Some things smell weird but taste awesome, and I was hoping that would be the case with Bacon Beans.  </li>
      <li>Just a funny gift at Christmas.</li>
      <li>exactly like they smell, only more intense.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell when you first open the box is quite strong.</li>
      <li>you have someone in your life you really dislike, you should dare them to chew and swallow a whole handful of these, otherwise, admire the pretty tin and don&#x27;t eat the beans.</li>
      <li>And she really likes butt crack.</li>
      <li>I had to give her some real dog treats to get the taste out of her mouth.</li>
      <li>These really taste like bacon.  </li>
      <li>And these looked like fun when I got them as an early stocking stuffer.  </li>
      <li>I feel rather accomplished that I managed to chew and swallow one without throwing up.&lt;br</li>
      <li>As I started to chew, I felt like my mouth was being filled with smoke and actually started to cough.</li>
      <li>Not so much.  </li>
      <li>though the tin was well shrink-wrapped, the jelly inside wasn&#x27;t very chewy at all.</li>
      <li>Giving these 4 stars, since they really a novelty candy</li>
      <li>Feel free to offer them to people you don&#x27;t necessarily like, though.</li>
      <li>very often.&lt;br /&gt;the product was very tasty.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to make a jelly bean more foul-tasting than the old Harry Potter Hogwarts beans in &amp;#34;grass&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;vomit&amp;#34; flavor.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure chugging liquid smoke flavoring straight from the bottle would be less intense.</li>
      <li>I suppose these would be good being used as a mean prank on your friends.</li>
      <li>They taste more or less</li>
      <li>but it is followed quickly by the taste of plastic soaked in lighter fluid and set on fire.    </li>
      <li>Seriously, do not plan to eat them.</li>
      <li>and so i was not expecting high quality.</li>
      <li>I guess I got my hopes up to high.</li>
      <li>It was a great gag gift for my bacon obsessed husband.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for those who like to chew on old circuit boards.</li>
      <li>Bought these for my bacon loving brother in-law a silly joke gift.</li>
      <li>I loved the idea, but unfortunately, the taste did not live up to it&#x27;s name.</li>

<li> Novelty only... not very tasty.</li>
<li> &quot; I can smell it and taste it long after eating a bean.</li>
<li> Lots of fun to watch the reaction of poor unsuspecting victims as the flavor sets in.    </li>
<li> Unfortunately it starts of as burnt plastic and then moves quickly into cherry flavored Chloraseptic throat spray.  </li>
<li> Great idea, but they taste terrible.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had some strange flavored jelly beans that taste like whatever they&#x27;re meant to be (cut grass, black pepper, popcorn)</li>
<li> After several more chews, I did get some weird faint hint of bacon...perhaps being cooked on a melting plastic plate over a pit of burning leaves.</li>
<li> I bought these for my 10 year old son who LOVES bacon -you could say he&#x27;s a bit of a fanatic!  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think there are enough words in the English language to accurately describe how awful these are.</li>
<li> Swallowing took a few tries and I felt rather queasy afterward.</li>
<li> Although, I have given it out to many friends and they all hate it.</li>
<li> but even then, every few minutes the smell and taste would return.</li>
<li> Three out of three family members spit them out after a few seconds.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s what I would expect if I were to drink a spoonful of liquid smoke and then eat a few jellybeans.  </li>
<li> When I opened the tin the smell only got worse.  </li>
<li> I understand what the other reviewers mean about the taste being like a campfire, or something along those lines.</li>
<li> These things were rock-hard, stale and tasted like I can only imagine little smoke pellets might taste like.  </li>
<li> These not only taste weird, they taste nothing like bacon.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a cute idea, but the taste is horrible.</li>
<li> Needless to say, I had to go with something else last minute for my nephews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These not only taste weird, they taste nothing like bacon.</li>
    <li> Great idea, but they taste terrible.  I use them as a joke candy now, when we have guests.  Giving these 4 stars, since they really a novelty candy</li>
    <li> Imagine how weird you think bacon jelly beans would taste - now think of something weirder than that.</li>
    <li> These really taste like bacon.  It takes forever to get the taste from your mouth and they are great to put in the office candy jar and wait for unsuspecting  victims to eat one...</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moGFXPLUJMPOAI]]So, this was the morning torture... everyone that ate one felt violated and traumatized. Then our Russian physicist, Andris, tried one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This guy is tough as nails.</li>
    <li> A very mixed reaction. It&#x27;s like having the rotting corpse of a cherished one brought back to life.</li>
    <li> My first thought of the taste of these beans was \\&quot;burning building.\\&quot; I can smell it and taste it long after eating a bean. It has a hint of liquid smoke, but mostly tastes like molten asbestos. The tin looks cool, and it&#x27;s great fun to offer to friends.</li>
    <li> This product is disgusting.  When you open the tin, the smell is so bad that you gag!  Unfortunately, I decided to taste one and had to spit it out.  The taste was so BAD and lingered so long that it took hours for the taste to leave my mouth.  Shame on Accoutrements.</li>
    <li> I love bacon.  LOVE it.  And these looked like fun when I got them as an early stocking stuffer.  I was excited to see what bacon jellybeans might taste like--I was expecting maybe they&#x27;d have that fake baconesque flavor like Bacon bits or Bacon Salt, which is suspect but oddly enjoyable.  Not so.  As soon as I unwrapped the plastic shrink wrap I was apprehensive, because the aroma that wafted up to greet my nostrils kind of smelled like old band aids.  When I opened the tin the smell only got worse.  Some things smell weird but taste awesome, and I was hoping that would be the case with Bacon Beans.  Not so much.  They taste more or less exactly like they smell, only more intense.  The closest I can come to describing the flavor of these things is that they taste as if I were chugging a bottle of Chloraseptic throat spray while standing in the cloud of smoke from a tire fire.  As I type this ten minutes later I still have yet to rid myself of the aftertaste, and I fear I may be unclean forever.  Avoid these unless you don&#x27;t plan to actually eat them, or are going to force them on someone you dislike.  A lot.  The tin they come in is really cool though, and that&#x27;s what earned the two stars.</li>
    <li> This should not even be considered bacon-flavored.  I&#x27;ll admit that they are a great gag gift, but there is no bacon flavor in the jelly bean.  It has more of as after taste of Nyquil than bacon.  Basically some bored chemist sat in a lab late on night and mixed up some nasty tasting formula.  Sure it had the hint of a bacon flavor, but by no means should it be confuced with bacon.</li>
    <li> These are interesting and fun to pass around to a group, but I haven&#x27;t met anyone yet who wants more than one. I&#x27;ve had some strange flavored jelly beans that taste like whatever they&#x27;re meant to be (cut grass, black pepper, popcorn) but these taste nothing like bacon. More like ashtray and refried beans. The container is the best part of the product.</li>
    <li> It one thing to sell a novelty product that resembles the advertised flavor, but this tasted like nail polish remover.  Made my daughter gag, literally.&lt;br /&gt;k</li>
    <li> I assumed the product would be somewhat edible so I didn&#x27;t research it like I should have.  Holy crap these are bad.  The taste is difficult to describe - there is some bacon flavor but it is followed quickly by the taste of plastic soaked in lighter fluid and set on fire.    Don&#x27;t buy these unless you have a serious hate for the person that will consume them.</li>
    <li> If they had labeled these as burnt electrical transformer flavored, I&#x27;d say they nailed it.  The aroma is somewhere between bad scotch and a tire fire.  Lots of fun to watch the reaction of poor unsuspecting victims as the flavor sets in.    Highly recommended for those who like to chew on old circuit boards.</li>
    <li> When I bought these, I was hoping for jelly beans that tasted like the peppered bacon \\&quot;Bertie Bott&#x27;s Beans\\&quot; that Jelly Belly produces. Those are great. These are not. They taste like a combination of liquid smoke and motor oil, and the taste is hard to get out of your mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only redeeming quality is the nice tin that the beans come in. I suppose these would be good being used as a mean prank on your friends.</li>
    <li> kids said they were ok</li>
    <li> I am sure that to some this product tastes like bacon - BUT - to me and all the people that I have let try ths product it is the most DISGUISTING thing I have ever tasted. I bought this as a gag gift and that is what happened when we tried them - we gagged!!! In a fairness to the company I will have to say they delivered the product very quickly and the packaging is wonderful!</li>
    <li> These were purchased as a &amp;#34;gag&amp;#34; gift for a bacon fanatic.  The tin was worth the price, but the flavor was the part that became the literal Gag!  So, if you collect tins, it&#x27;s spectacular.  However, unless your taste buds are masochistic, don&#x27;t eat them!</li>
    <li> The jelly beans are stale and taste like a burnt charcoal briquettes. Seriously, do not plan to eat them. Feel free to offer them to people you don&#x27;t necessarily like, though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute idea, but the taste is horrible. It doesn&#x27;t have a bacon flavor. It&#x27;s what I would expect if I were to drink a spoonful of liquid smoke and then eat a few jellybeans.  It makes a great gag gift, if you really want people to gag. No one I know would eat more than one, and most would spit out the first as soon as they bit into it.</li>
    <li> I bought these for stocking gift for my husband . We tried them and immediately spit them out. The taste is so bad that chemical taste . We even rinsed out our mouths out and the bad taste stayed . Absolutely just AWFUL !</li>
    <li> They do not taste as bad as I thought they would.  It was a great gag gift for my bacon obsessed husband.</li>
    <li> My husband loved these.  He is a bacon nut so I put these in his Xmas stocking and he loved it.  Actually, my grandson loved the Jelly Beans.</li>
    <li> Whoever created this nasty concoction is a sick indivigual. I have to urge to induce vomiting and call the poison control hotline.</li>
    <li> Yes, I am a bacon junkie. Somehow I was expecting JellyBelly quality taste. I mean, if they can nail buttered toast, spinach, dirt, and even vomit, how hard could bacon be? Of course, these are NOT JellyBellys and they taste worse than bacon flavored cat food. Even the dog doesn&#x27;t like them.</li>
    <li> A joke-gift for my Brother. It&#x27;s freaking perfect. I don&#x27;t care how they taste, as they say &#x27;it&#x27;s the thought that counts&#x27;</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and it was well received.</li>
    <li> The tin is amazing cool. The jelly beans are not.</li>
    <li> I personally love it. Although, I have given it out to many friends and they all hate it. It does have those smoky flavors of bacon along with some added sweetness overall.</li>
    <li> The tin is great and being a lover of tasty salty pig parts I was intrigued.  Unfortunately it starts of as burnt plastic and then moves quickly into cherry flavored Chloraseptic throat spray.  The Chloraseptic people should sue because someone obviously stole their proprietary formula.  Absolutely awful.</li>
    <li> Great but small amount</li>
    <li> I received some as a gag-gift, no pun intended.  I immediately liked them. I like the smoky start and the sweet finish of these jelly beans.  In fact, I hopped on Amazon to see if I could find more... and well, here I am. The best part about these is nobody else will put their grubby paws into my jelly bean jar, now!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my bacon loving brother in-law a silly joke gift. They were inexpensive enough but the taste is god awful. Three out of three family members spit them out after a few seconds.</li>
    <li> Novelty only... not very tasty.</li>
    <li> These are a fun product, but they taste nasty when the candy taste mixes with the bacon flavor.</li>
    <li> Or at least the stuff they use to numb your mouth before they administer a novacaine shot at the dentist. Starts off promising, tasting like smoke flavor and then boom!  Nasty.</li>
    <li> I intended to buy these as a gag gift for my nephews for Easter. Although I purchased them 3 business days beforehand, with Prime shipping, they did not arrive until 2 business days AFTER Easter. Needless to say, I had to go with something else last minute for my nephews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My own kids expressed an interest in trying them when they arrived, so I got to experience these first hand. I knew before I bought them that the reviews were terrible. I was buying them for the novelty factor, and watching people make terrible faces while trying to eat them just sounded like a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said....I don&#x27;t think there are enough words in the English language to accurately describe how awful these are. While trying to eat these, my brain was screaming at me that these could not possibly be edible, should not be classified as food and I should spit it out. I feel rather accomplished that I managed to chew and swallow one without throwing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell when you first open the box is quite strong. It smelled like a campfire that people had been throwing plastic and styrofoam plates onto. As I popped one in my mouth, the first thing I tasted was burnt hair smells like. As I started to chew, I felt like my mouth was being filled with smoke and actually started to cough. I&#x27;m pretty sure chugging liquid smoke flavoring straight from the bottle would be less intense. After several more chews, I did get some weird faint hint of bacon...perhaps being cooked on a melting plastic plate over a pit of burning leaves. Swallowing took a few tries and I felt rather queasy afterward. It took about 20 Jolly Rancher Jelly Beans to get the taste out of my mouth afterward....but even then, every few minutes the smell and taste would return. I tasted burnt plastic on and off for hours afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have someone in your life you really dislike, you should dare them to chew and swallow a whole handful of these, otherwise, admire the pretty tin and don&#x27;t eat the beans.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 10 year old son who LOVES bacon -you could say he&#x27;s a bit of a fanatic!  I loved the packaging.  However, my son did not like the taste of the jellybeans.  He said they tasted like ham and nothing like bacon.  In fact, he spit it out of his mouth because he disliked it so much.  I loved the idea, but unfortunately, the taste did not live up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
    <li> They taste like butt crack.... or what I think butt crack would taste like. The dog ate one. I had to give her some real dog treats to get the taste out of her mouth. Now she runs away if you offer her one. And she really likes butt crack. So I guess these are worse than butt crack. Good prank. Get someone to try one and then video them when the after taste kicks in. Send in the Video to AFV, might win.</li>
    <li> I understand what the other reviewers mean about the taste being like a campfire, or something along those lines. After all, real bacon kind of has that taste, doesn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;I think these do a pretty good job of hitting the right flavor, but I had a problem with the jelly inside of the candy coating.&lt;br /&gt;Even though the tin was well shrink-wrapped, the jelly inside wasn&#x27;t very chewy at all. The best thing to do with these is to eat off the candy coating and spit out the inside. Once you&#x27;re done with them, you&#x27;ll probably want to keep the cool tin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s candy and it&#x27;s bacon... I guess I got my hopes up to high. It was more of a cinnamon it seemed to me. The candy aside wasn&#x27;t bad just not bacon-y.</li>
    <li> Just a funny gift at Christmas. Smelled exactly like bacon, but tasted like it is for chemical cleaning</li>
    <li> So if you like really disgusting jelly beans these are the ones for you. I got it as a joke present and so i was not expecting high quality.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to make a jelly bean more foul-tasting than the old Harry Potter Hogwarts beans in &amp;#34;grass&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;vomit&amp;#34; flavor. Well, I was wrong. These things were rock-hard, stale and tasted like I can only imagine little smoke pellets might taste like.  Do not buy these to eat them.  Look at them, giggle a bit, and then throw them away. I didn&#x27;t even put them in my apocolypse kit. I don&#x27;t think even a zombie would eat them. Disgusting.</li>
    <li> These can&#x27;t be anything more than a gag joke. They were the nastiest thing I&#x27;ve ever tasted. It tasted like rancid meat.</li>
    <li> I loved the tin these came in.  It was a nice addition to our everything bacon gift basket.</li>
    <li> The worst tasting jelly bean, unless you like the taste of iodine.</li>
    <li> He loved them &amp; shared with his family.  You don&#x27;t  see this caliber of boy very often.&lt;br /&gt;the product was very tasty.</li>
