<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this my hair feels so much better doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out!!</li>
    <li> whoever engineered this design should be fired! its biggest flaw is that the buttons on the iron are right where you put your fingers to hold it, so you inadvertently are constantly changing the temp. on it and you hear beep, beep, beep every second you use it! Also, it only straightens hair really good if you have the temp. as high as it can go. and the outer shell isn&#x27;t as heat-resistant as my other flat irons have been so I easily burn myself</li>
    <li> Works great. I didn&#x27;t like where the buttons are on the outside. But after reading the directions I realized there is a way to set the temp to stay even if you touched the setting. So now I love this straightener.</li>
    <li> This hair straightner works great. I used to use the Chir iron but, it broke. I purchased this product for a lot less than a Chi iron and it works just as well. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It gets the hair straight &amp; gets the job done. Just wish I could get to the roots better, however the curved sides help to eliminate accidental scalp burning. So it has its advantages.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  The only complaint I have is your fingers hit the buttons a lot when you are using it but it still works like a charm! Its a great flat iron!</li>
    <li> I have this iron and love it - it is a professional quality iron which straightens and creates beautiful curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some confusion aboutt he button placement - that you will hit them as you are styling, BUT YOU CAN LOCK IN the correct temperature...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See information below from the manufacturers website&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Professional Features&lt;br /&gt;*Titanium surface for ultra smooth, snag-free styling&lt;br /&gt; *Korean designed and engineered&lt;br /&gt; *Ceramic heaters generate fast heat up and instant heat recovery&lt;br /&gt; *Patented Pulse Technology®&lt;br /&gt; *Variable heat settings, up to 450°F&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Heat Locking Feature: Press the button twice while the appliance is at the selected heat setting.

    <li> This is a Great product for low cost. This flat iron heats up fast. Also, adjustable temperature for higher heat level.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because my sister also has it and I&#x27;ve used hers.   I liked it so much especially because of the heat settings &amp; how it just glides right through you&#x27;re hair.   I have relaxed hair and I&#x27;m a black female. I have no complaints about this flat iron.   You can lock the temperature ladies by clicking the power button twice after you&#x27;ve picked your setting. You&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s   locked when a little lock icon shows up.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend! Love that you can lock heat setting.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands or styles. After considerable research, I did look for certain features, however, and I am glad that I did. It has variable temperature control which is nice (actually, essential) if you have fine, thin or processed hair. I use a setting of 360 on my fine hair and it works well. The plates are floating, which makes it easy to get a good grip. It heats up fast. The 10 hour shut-off time seems a bit excessive -- wouldn&#x27;t one or two hours be sufficient? -- but at least it does shut off. I knew about the poor button placement before I purchased it, but figured that the locking feature would make it less annoying. Well, it didn&#x27;t. I am still struggling with that, constantly changing the temp or turning the thing off. My main complaint, however, is a total lack of instructions! I guessed at what temperature to use and how quickly to move the iron through my hair for straightening. I know it can be used for curling, but my efforts in that arena have totally failed. Still, I am happy with the implement, which I use only for a final smoothing of my &#x27;do -- I can achieve shiny body with little fuss.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this on amazon,but I did buy it at Ulta. I spent about $80 on it, and it lasted about a year. Maybe. Then one day..it just stopped working. I didnt even use it everyday. Maybe 4-5 times a week max. And I have straight hair, I just used it to smooth out everything, so it&#x27;s not like i was putting it through frizzy curly hair all the time, it just flat out stopped working. No more hot tools for me  I&#x27;ve spent $20 or less on curling irons that I still have, 10 years later and still work. I&#x27;m going to wal- mart  for my next hair tool.  I gave it two stars because while it worked, I likd it. But I&#x27;m more interested in longevity.</li>
    <li> Wonderful iron works great on my very thick hair. Wish the controls were inside the clamp to prevent pushing buttons but it does have a locking feature so not a big issue.</li>
    <li> Like this flat iron a lot.  My only complaint is the placement of the on / off setting button.no way to avoid hitting it while in use.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron.  I have super curly/frizzy hair &amp; every once in awhile I want it straight without the use of chemicals.  It heats up quickly &amp; cleans easy. (It is always covered in hairspray by the time I finish)  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the location of the buttons. They are located right in the place you would hold while flat ironing your hair.  I am consently hitting them and turning the heat down as I straighten my hair. You can&#x27;t move your hand higher because of the heat and its hard to close the flat iron if you move your hand lower. The power button also is not an off switch.  You actually need to unplug it from the wall to turn it off.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and as advertized.  Since this was a gift, I really can&#x27;t critique how it works.  The person who received it said it was highly recommended to her by her hairdresser as a good one and very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this flat iron. It is her third one and says it&#x27;s the best she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
    <li> It works wonderful. When they Saud single pass I was apprehensive but it really does straighten with a single pass! It also heats up really quick! Only complaint is that I have to unplug it to get it to power off.</li>
    <li> I love many other hot tools products, and this one does a great job of getting really hot and staying hot.  It also straightened my hair beautifully and provided lots of shine, so why don&#x27;t I like it?  Well, the power button is in a super awkward place (at least for me).  It&#x27;s right where I grip the iron to pass the plates through my hair, and I kept pushing either the heat adjust button, or the power button.  I tried holding it a different way, but that gave me a hand-cramp (the perils of beauty).  I&#x27;ve noticed the majority of the other hot tools flat irons have a similar power button placement, which is unfortunate.</li>
    <li> Gets really hot, does the job! Didn&#x27;t fry my hair like the chi. Worth the money but the buttons are in a bad place I touch them all the time. I have learned where to place my hands so not to shut it off while styling</li>
    <li> When the Hot Yools arrived broken. I called amazon and talked to a female. I told her that I will work with what I have because I own a salon and I needed the flat irons. She informed me with her apologies and stated the she would credit me $35.00. And I never received the credit!</li>
    <li> This looks nice but would pinch my hand every time I used it and it didn&#x27;t get hot enough. I returned for a full refund.</li>
    <li> this flat iron heats really fast and works great I do have fine hair but I keep it at a low heat and it works with one pass.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, I had woken up late after falling asleep with my hair wet the night before.  This straightener had it perfect in 5 minutes. Best straightener I have ever used, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this flat iron quite often and it works pretty well. Not worth the price though. Could have gotten a less expensive one and would have been just as happy.</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing a flat iron, was super excited about it! It came super fast, and i used it 4 times. The 5th time, while i was using it, it made this popping sound, then stopped working, and did not work after. I have it just over a month, and the warrenty ws for 30 days. Silly me, i thought it would last longer then that. I used it at 400 degrees every time, told by my hair lady to do so, so i have no idea why it broke. I would not reccomend purchasing this product. May be less expensive, but not worth a few times using it. Save your money</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome and works great. The only downfall is that&#x27;s it&#x27;s easy to touch the electronic on and off switch.</li>
    <li> This is a little smaller than my other flat iron but it&#x27;s a perfect fit for my suitcase. It heats super fast and so far I&#x27;ve had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> This flat iron does a wonderful job at smoothing hair.&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will look like it just came out of a salon.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the placement of the controls.&lt;br /&gt;Your hand will click on the controls when working with your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this product again?  You bet!  My hair looks wonderful!</li>
    <li> Adorable and Cute,yet high quality. Works Well and heats up really fast. Good for coarse hair</li>
    <li> Works great for me. I am happy with the purchase...</li>
    <li> It works ok. I have thin, wavy hair and had to have the temp turned all the way up.  Also the postioning of the power button is annoying but it is nice you can lock it on.</li>
    <li> I read in other review about the placement of the buttons that control the temperature and how poorly it was designed.  I have had absolutely no problem whatsoever.  Just change up a little where you place your hands on the flat iron.  It&#x27;s really not an issue.  Makes my hair soft, smooth and straight.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this hair straightener works so good and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair</li>
    <li> Heats up very quickly. When it takes about 45 mins to straighten my hair, with the Hot Tools, it takes about 10-15mins at the most. The only downfall of this device is where the ON/OFF button is at. There&#x27;s a trick around it but you have to find it. Overall great product.</li>
    <li> I really like this, it gets the job done and rather quickly.  However you do have to make more then one pass through sections of hair.</li>
    <li> The first time I purchased this exact model of flat iron was about 5 years ago. I purchased it for around $80 and it broke after my daughter left it on the floor and stepped on it. I went back to the store where I bought it originally and it was still $80, I searched Amazon and found it for much cheaper and bought two of them (one for my daughter and one for myself). I love this product and will refuse to buy any other flat iron on the market.</li>
    <li> I love this sleek little gadget!  Just used it for the first time and was very impressed with the ease, durability, heat, and function.  Love the digital read-out.  Hot Tools is a great brand without the salon price!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It goes over your hair really smooth, and doesn&#x27;t get caught. Great buy!!!  You can always use a flat iron to make curls too... it can work for flat iron and curls too.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do. I just wish the buttons were in a better place. They seem to get in the way every time you pick it up and try to straighten your hair</li>
    <li> Perfect example of what a flat iron should do! Which is straighten. My hair is super curly and in just one swipe it&#x27;s straightened, my hair is also past my waist and it takes me like 30 min to straighten every bit. It&#x27;s also perfect for curls since it&#x27;s rounded! I love it! It was time to replace my old one and this was great.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron and immediately fell in love with it. It is sleek and works amazing! I have medium length hair that is curly- i blow dry a little first and then use the flat iron-- it works amazingly!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I traveled to Dominican Republic recently and it is very humid there - I have been there before and could never straighten my hair but i used this flat iron and it stayed straight throughout the humid nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would def reccommend this flat iron to anyone and everyone!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** the buttons are on the outside and they do change if you do not lock the temp in - all you have to do is press the on button twice once you pick the temp you would like.</li>
    <li> These were my first pair of titanium Flat Irons and they definitely get the job done. Leaves my hair looking very professional. One thing I don&#x27;t like is that the buttons are located on the handle and you constantly press them , Its very annoying . Great product bad design.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! Yes the buttons are in an spot where they get hit a lot. There is a lock function. Learn how to use it and use it ;)</li>
    <li> People are right that the button placement is inconvenient, but it&#x27;s not too hard to adjust to holding it different. And the titanium plates really give a far better straighten and shine than any other straightener I have used. I have been using it for a few months now and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! I had a Chi until it broke and this flat iron workes so much better than the Chi did for me.  My hair is very thick and coarse and tends to frizz up but after using the Hot Tools iron, my hair looked and felt sleek, tame and straight.  I would recommend this iron if your hair is very thick and you need an iron that gets hot!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because the power and heat buttons are in a strange place- right near where you would hold the hot iron- so you can and most likely will accidently touch these buttons during use.  Other than that, the iron works great.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. This is fabulous for thick and wavy hair. It gets hot enough (450 degrees) to straighten all the curl out of my hair underneath but then I adjust it to a lower temp for my top layers. It does adjust pretty quick too. The only down fall is the temp button placement. But I would not let that change your decision to not buy this.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Flat Iron&#x27;s I have ever used.  This is the 4th one that I have purchased  It give a really lustrous gloss to the hair without burning or being too hot.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This straighten gives me bone straight hair. I do really like it. It gets really hot. I don&#x27;t recommend turning it up to 450. Use a heat protectant. I have naturally curly/wavy 3b hair.</li>
    <li> This is ok but doesn&#x27;t seem easy to lock your hair in. Just kind of glides over and doesn&#x27;t smooth the hair.  Weird also is trying to make a slight curl by angling doesn&#x27;t work either. I hate to go all the way up over 380 degrees but maybe that is what is needed.  Also recently the power button won&#x27;t work to turn it off.  I have to unplug it to work. I don&#x27;t have the packaging anymore to return it.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of more expensive flat irons that probably are wonderful, but this is a great flat iron that is easy to use, heats up quickly, and gives you beautifully straight hair quick. I really love hot tools and will stick with them.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed. It gets hot enough and quick but the power buttons are right where I hold the iron which I find annoying. Also it has snagged my hair a few times. i didn&#x27;t spend a ton of money so it&#x27;s not worth returning I just figured others might like to know. I have fairly long wavy hair that straightens well and quick with this iron.</li>
    <li> after a nice wash i blow dry and then flat iron my hair, it get the job done gives me the look i want and it gives of great heat to press out your hair.</li>
    <li> The flattening part of this product works great. On the other hand, the buttons are in a horrible place on the straightener. It&#x27;s placed in such a spot that every time you twist the product in any way you&#x27;re almost sure to adjust the temperature. I really don&#x27;t want to fry my hair nor do I want to check the temp every time I press the button!</li>
    <li> i love this flat iron! After you lock in your desired temperature and position your hands on the iron away from the bottons it&#x27;s really not a big deal where they are located as so many have complained about. Definitely would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> When using this product, your fingers constantly touch the buttons. These buttons beep the entire time.  What a pain.  Turning the iron off and on the entire time.  My husband gets upset that he can hear the beeps the whole time I&#x27;m getting ready for work..</li>
    <li> I love this! I had to order another one since I lost my old one :( but I had it for almost 5 years and it still worked!</li>
    <li> I love my Hot tools flat iron I use it consistently and the irons have yet to start burning. Like most of my irons do after a year or so. Just make sure you turn it off when your done since it has an 8 hour auto turn off. haha</li>
    <li> I love this iron, the price was great, heats super fast and was recommended to me buy my stylist due to the reason that Hot Tools are really good quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron quite awhile ago, but let&#x27;s just say I don&#x27;t have it any longer. I&#x27;ve purchased SO many flat irons over the years, and it seems that no matter how much research I do prior, they die within a year or so. What I can say about this one is that it worked reasonably well for the price point. I honestly don&#x27;t recall exactly how much I paid for this particular iron, but I know I couldn&#x27;t have paid an unreasonable amount. The heat payoff was perfect for straightening my hair relatively quickly without needing to go over each section a ton of times, so that was good. The thing I wasn&#x27;t very happy with is the lifespan. One day I plugged it in, and halfway through straightening it randomly died. I don&#x27;t believe I had it longer than 6 months. This was the very last flat iron I purchased before going ahead and giving Chi a try, and let&#x27;s just say my Chi is still going strong 2+ years later...granted I paid much more for the Chi. If you&#x27;re looking to purchase this iron I would just keep in mind that it&#x27;s not the longest lasting on the market, but it&#x27;s effective in comparison to others of the same price.</li>
    <li> This is a really good flat iron!  I love the fact you can&#x27;t control the temperature.  I&#x27;m very happy with it &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
    <li> It heats up very quickly and works great. In fact, my daughter loved her own straightener (different brand) until she used mine. I might just have to buy one for her as well.</li>
    <li> Everything is perfect about this Flat Iron, except I keep turing on and off when straightening my hair, bc the on/off button is right when I press down.</li>
    <li> It is great!!! I love it</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as my BaByliss, but it does a nice job.  It takes longer to straighten my hair, but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair as much...so I use it on days I have more time.  When I need to straighten it quickly, I still use my BaByliss, because that thing is the monster of straightening.</li>
    <li> I am a junior cosmetology student and this flat iron was included in my kit. I liked it a lot AT FIRST.... My hair was newly relaxed when I started to use it so of course it got the job done with no problem. Now 3 months post relaxer and I have to turn it all the way up to 450 to relax my new growth and i have fine/course hair!!! So now I am eyeballing a PROFESSIONAL flat iron that wont damage my hair just to straighten it.</li>
    <li> There is nothing you can say bad about this item!!  It is totally awesome.  Heats up in seconds...handy!!  Just wonderful.  I love it and if you are looking for one, this is it!!!</li>
