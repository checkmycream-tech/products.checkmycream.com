      <li>So if you are looking for that perfect miracle product then quit looking because there is no such thing.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m seeing results already about to buy a couple more wish they had soap to go with it</li>

      <li>I find it refreshing after applying.</li>

      <li>I would love to erase.</li>
      <li>Who among us, even the most confident of souls, hasn&#x27;t squinted at their belly and thighs, turning and twisting in the mirror to get a view from all directions- looking with an eagle eye for even the slightest signs of that menace:</li>

      <li>I just love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll see even better results</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>That is why I was so excited to receive The bonapiel anti-cellulite firming lotion to try and review for my unbiased and honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it really smells nice and is very easy to work with.</li>
      <li>Light texture cream that smells refreshing.</li>
      <li>and I love the light scent.</li>
      <li>It does have a very strong smell, not bad in any way, but strong.</li>
      <li>I feel if I could get into a great workout routine combined with this cream that I could definitely see even better results.</li>
      <li>and I can easily see myself using this as  a long-term preventative measure to keep cellulite at bay.</li>
      <li>I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
      <li>Strong smell of mint and citrus.</li>
      <li>In less that 3 weeks I&#x27;m prancing around the house in shorts because I am so impressed with results.</li>
      <li>It also smells REALLY nice, better than the cellulite creams that I’ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>Powered with Caffeine and Retinol, Bonapiel helps to smooth away cellulite and tighten skin.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample to try.</li>
      <li>so far, do good.  </li>
      <li>my pi&#x27;s right after or make sure I didn&#x27;t sit on anything</li>
      <li>I am glad I got this on a special because I do not feel the full price would have been worth it.</li>
      <li>I am using this on my stomach first as that is my most problem area.</li>
      <li>Unique smell, goes on very smooth and dries pretty quick.</li>
      <li>It absorbed fast and had a nice smell to it.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and fresh, no overpowering scents.</li>
      <li>I used this one with my derma roller to see the full transformation.</li>
      <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
      <li>The Bonapiel cream is cool on the skin and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still a worthy goal.</li>
      <li>It has an odd smell to it, but it works great as a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Cream is a pudding like constancy and absorbed quickly into my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit sticky, but that sticky feeling goes away once it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin (which is quickly).</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>It quickly dries and doesnt leave your skin feeling anything but soft and smooth and firm.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was using it every day after the shower and before bedtime, a little amount is enough to have the greatest moisture feeling.</li>
      <li>The packaging is rather large for the price, so there is a lot of cream!</li>
      <li>and I think I need more time for actual results.</li>
      <li>I was recently given the opportunity to try this cellulite cream for FREE!</li>
      <li>I plan to keep using it in the future, even when I have to buy more, because I feel that it is truly helping reduce the visible cellulite on my body.</li>
      <li>Now that I have this product I have taken the first step into trying to get rid of that stubborn cellulite.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin soft and smooth without leaving it sticky.</li>
      <li>as it is being noted in other reviews, that is when you should start seeing some kind of change.</li>
      <li>I have only been using it for a week, so when it comes to much results, I have not seen many.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff wasn&#x27;t using it for to long</li>
      <li>I am also using Pure Shea Butter on other areas of my body, ignoring my thighs and because of the smell of pure shea, I now love the smell of the Bonapiel Anti Cellulite &amp; Body Firming Cream.</li>
      <li>Its containe&#x27;s a better combination of 2 powerful ingredients that have been proved to help firm up skin as well as fight cellulite .</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>It really balances things out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The texture is a bit sticky but the results are fast.  </li>
      <li>Once you use this product a couple of days, you really don’t notice it much.</li>
      <li>, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
      <li>packaging is very well done and shipping is fast .</li>
      <li>cream contains caffeine retinol, rose hip oil and lactic acid which are supposed to help fight cellulite and tighten, tone and firm your skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am a 57 year old woman who has troubled skin and this cream is one of the best buys for your money.</li>
      <li>I do like this company and think they do a real professional job you can really see the quality in their products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Light texture cream that smells refreshing. Has a cooling sensation after application.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> just received this today, so no actual results yet. Will continue to use this product. Strong smell of mint and citrus. It is a very nice smell. Cream is a pudding like constancy and absorbed quickly into my skin. I am using this on my stomach first as that is my most problem area. Will update again in about 2 weeks, as it is being noted in other reviews, that is when you should start seeing some kind of change.</li>
    <li> Just starting using and I think I need more time for actual results. What I can tell you is the smell is nice and has a good tingling feeling. I will keep using on a daily basis and report back on my progress. so far, do good.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I totally love this product! It is working for me and I am getting great results from it.  I will continue to purchase this item!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using only a few days and as of now I don&#x27;t see any visible improvement in my skin</li>
    <li> I just bought my second tube of this.  I do see an improvement with one bottle.  Hope to see even better results with two !!</li>
    <li> Great cream. Helped me all over with tightening and toning.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any big change with this product. It has an odd smell to it, but it works great as a moisturizer. I will continue to use the product until it is gone and see if I notice anything more. I know that there is not an overnight miracule.</li>
    <li> Smells good and had a nice texture. It does seem to be reducing my cellulite. I would (have) recommended this product</li>
    <li> Cellulite treatment &amp; body firming cream made my skin feel slightly tighter but I did not care for the feel of the cream and the tightness did not last. I am glad I got this on a special because I do not feel the full price would have been worth it.</li>
    <li> I received this cream and have starting using it.  The cream is smooth and a bit heavier than the other Bonapiel products that I have tried.  I&#x27;m not certain how well this works at firming yet, but I do know that caffeine as an active ingredient has been shown to have a positive impact on the appearance of cellulite.</li>
    <li> We all struggle with skin imperfections are we age and I too have little dimpls in the backs of my thighs I would love to erase. That is why I was so excited to receive The bonapiel anti-cellulite firming lotion to try and review for my unbiased and honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a pleasing aroma of fresh orange, it applies smoothly and a little bit can go along way. It quickly dries and doesnt leave your skin feeling anything but soft and smooth and firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using I have noticied reconizable change and am conitnuing to use so I can keep documenting the changes I see.</li>
    <li> I receive this cream while ago, but I decide to used after losing some weight. I just finish the bottle and I notice an improvement  in the skin of my legs, they are quite smoother and softer. I was using it every day after the shower and before bedtime, a little amount is enough to have the greatest moisture feeling. The smell is pleasant and reminds me an spa citric treatment aroma. I would continue with a second bottle  to see it could be a further improvement.</li>
    <li> I love it. It really works. Thank you creating awesome products Bonapiel</li>
    <li> It smells good but  I have more cellulite &#x27;&#x27;&#x27; it didn&#x27;t help at all.  It&#x27;s worse I have more. Honestly it don&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Very happy with this item. Great texture, nice smell. not oily. I have just started using it so it is too soon to review, but I do see my skin is hydrated, as before it was very dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many cellulite lotions and potions before but by far this is the best! The texture is a bit sticky but the results are fast.  Will be ordering again</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! I am a 57 year old woman who has troubled skin and this cream is one of the best buys for your money. The packaging is rather large for the price, so there is a lot of cream! The scent is light and fresh, no overpowering scents. It is also a cream that delivers and I have only had it for a short time. I would recommend this cream and it would make a great gift too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bikini season again! Who among us, even the most confident of souls, hasn&#x27;t squinted at their belly and thighs, turning and twisting in the mirror to get a view from all directions- looking with an eagle eye for even the slightest signs of that menace: cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay, my loves. Having a cute, firm butt may not win you any Nobel prizes but it&#x27;s still a worthy goal. That&#x27;s why I was curious to try this Anti-Cellulite and Body Firming Cream from Bonapiel. Though I don&#x27;t currently have visible cellulite, I&#x27;d very much like to KEEP it that way! Prevention is my best beauty friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream contains caffeine retinol, rose hip oil and lactic acid which are supposed to help fight cellulite and tighten, tone and firm your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of use, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results. The skin on my thighs appears somewhat firmer and smoother even after such a short time. I feel that with continued use I&#x27;ll see even better results and I can easily see myself using this as  a long-term preventative measure to keep cellulite at bay. I definitely will feel less self-conscious at  the beach for the rest of the summer!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get over the smell to use it long enough.</li>
    <li> Powered with Caffeine and Retinol, Bonapiel helps to smooth away cellulite and tighten skin. I have been using this product for about a week now on my legs. The cream itself is very smooth and soaks into the skin nicely. It does have a very strong smell, not bad in any way, but strong. Once you use this product a couple of days, you really don’t notice it much. I have only been using it for a week, so when it comes to much results, I have not seen many. One thing I have noticed is the tightening of the skin on my legs, which is amazing. I don’t have a lot of cellulite, but I do have some. My skin also feels so much smoother on my legs, just a really great feeling.&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I love about this product is the simple no nonsense packaging. Great Product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is one that would need weeks of testing to do a review that is extensive. I am going to continue to use this product over the next several weeks.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely thee best product I&#x27;ve ever tried. In less that 3 weeks I&#x27;m prancing around the house in shorts because I am so impressed with results. My friend cane over and complimented me on how toned I look yesterday! Amazing, amazing product!</li>
    <li> The Bonapiel Anti-Cellulite &amp; Body Firming Cream has a thick consistency (similar to condensed milk) and has a minty scent. It has an off-white color and is non-greasy. I&#x27;ve been using this on my left arm now to see if there would be a difference on my jiggly/flabby arm. The Bonapiel cream is cool on the skin and absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference on my arm because it does look more firm than before. I can&#x27;t credit it to the Bonapiel Cream alone though because I do workout too (with light weights and a few push-ups). I think the Bonapiel Cream helped in firming my arms a bit because with just the exercise alone, I find it very difficult to make my arms smaller.</li>
    <li> I also got a sample to try and see if I like it ,and I do it really smells nice and is very easy to work with. Its containe&#x27;s a better combination of 2 powerful ingredients that have been proved to help firm up skin as well as fight cellulite . packaging is very well done and shipping is fast . I do like this company and think they do a real professional job you can really see the quality in their products.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day on my legs after I get out of the shower. It makes my skin soft and smooth without leaving it sticky. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Just received it today and used it for the 1st time after I got out of the shower.  It absorbed fast and had a nice smell to it.</li>
    <li> This cream is very easy to apply and has a grapefruit smell. I find it refreshing after applying. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see a dramatic transformation, but plan to try it out for longer.</li>
    <li> My skin feels at least a little firmer and I love the light scent.</li>
    <li> Do you have cellulite? Then you want to try this product. If you follow my blog then you see that I often review cellulite and stretch mark products. I can&#x27;t help it. Its like a disease I can&#x27;t get rid of. I just like reviewing this products. I guess its because one day I have hope that I will come across a miracle product. I also just love how these products make my skin feel, even if it doesn&#x27;t make my skin perfect again. So if you are looking for that perfect miracle product then quit looking because there is no such thing. However, there is Bonapiel Cellulite Cream. It is promoted to reduce the appearance of stubborn cellulite while smoothing, firming and redefining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can promise you the cellulite does not go away by just using this product alone.  I can tell you that you will see and feel a slight difference with just using this product by itself. I have used this product for a month. I can definitely see and feel firmer, smoother skin. The cellulite is still there though but I feel better about my skin since using this product. I feel if I could get into a great workout routine combined with this cream that I could definitely see even better results. Now that I have this product I have taken the first step into trying to get rid of that stubborn cellulite.</li>
    <li> Really helps your skin look radiant and firm. Love it!</li>
    <li> I got this product based on the recommendation of Dr. Oz.  As soon as you open the package, you can smell the citrus aroma.  When you apply the cream, it absorbs easily and you can feel a slight tingling sensation.  I have been using this product twice a day for about a week and a half and I do believe I am seeing less cellulite on my thighs.  Plus it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.  I am going to continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I was recently given the opportunity to try this cellulite cream for FREE! (I LOVE FREE STUFF) :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the bottle it comes in—kind of like sunscreen, just squeeze the bottle to apply as much or as little as you’d like. It also smells REALLY nice, better than the cellulite creams that I’ve tried so far. I have been using this cream for two weeks now, and while I haven’t seen mind-blowing results in this short time, I have definitely noticed my skin is a bit tighter and more firm. I’m definitely going to keep using this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this product 8/10, just because it is tough to see results with a product like this. I plan to keep using it in the future, even when I have to buy more, because I feel that it is truly helping reduce the visible cellulite on my body.</li>
    <li> Wonderful - I am already seeing a difference</li>
    <li> This is good help for my body become smooth on skin. Yes it work! I am going reorder this bottle again</li>
    <li> Unique smell, goes on very smooth and dries pretty quick. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks on my stomach and thighs and arms. I haven&#x27;t really noticed much difference in my stomach area (pretty bad after 3 c-sections), but a slighter toner thigh and arms.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this and see the future results.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample to try. I have used it daily since I received it in mid July. It&#x27;s a bit sticky, but that sticky feeling goes away once it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin (which is quickly). I am also using Pure Shea Butter on other areas of my body, ignoring my thighs and because of the smell of pure shea, I now love the smell of the Bonapiel Anti Cellulite &amp; Body Firming Cream. It really balances things out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the firming and the look of my thighs, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference. It took a photograph for me to notice the change. I still have cellulite of course, but my legs are definitely a bit firmer and smoother!</li>
    <li> I know I can&#x27;t be the only one trying different miracle worker cellulite creams. I have a little on my upper thighs and have tried quite a few. I used this one with my derma roller to see the full transformation. I have used this for 4 days now and within that time already see the marks slightly less noticeable. The cream itself it very easy to apply. It says to rub on vigorously once or twice a day. It actually has a good smell and does not have the horrible chemical fragrance I have smelled in some. I plan on continuing to use this product to see the ultimate results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff wasn&#x27;t using it for to long but I&#x27;m seeing results already about to buy a couple more wish they had soap to go with it I just love it the smell is awesome the way it goes on your skin is wonderful</li>
    <li> I once read a statistic that somewhere around 90% of women have cellulite. I think those 10% that don&#x27;t are all the models and actresses we see on TV! It&#x27;s just a part of being a woman. I&#x27;ve always said if there was a product that could completely get rid of cellulite, then no one would have it! There is no miracle cure. But there are a few products out there that have shown to reduce the appearance of cellulite so I was curious to see if Bonapiel Anti Cellulite &amp; Body Firming Cream was one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied once a day before bed. I loved the cool, creamy texture and the minty smell. It has that scent that makes you feel like you are at a spa. I rubbed it into my thighs and buttocks until it was absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed I had a little bit of residue left on my hands after sometimes that felt like it was skin. I&#x27;m not sure if it removes the dead skin as part of it&#x27;s treatment or if it was just from the cream itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that while it did mostly absorb, it left me feeling a little sticky after. It took a while for that feeling to go away so I would either put on my pi&#x27;s right after or make sure I didn&#x27;t sit on anything right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using for almost a month, my cellulite is not gone but I do notice a different in the firmness of my skin and the appearance of my cellulite! In this case I think the Pros definitely outweigh the Cons and it&#x27;s worth using even if it leaves me a little sticky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bonapiel Anti Cellulite Cream is definitely effective at helping firm skin and reduce cellulite!</li>
