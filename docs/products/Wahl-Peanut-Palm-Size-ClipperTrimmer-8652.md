      <li>I can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
      <li>Love this trimmer.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT</li>
      <li>I had one before and lasted many years.</li>
      <li>trimmer has not been able to meet my expectations for both.  </li>
      <li>Love it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Amazon has the best price in comparison to my local Beauty Supply Houses.</li>
      <li>Great edge trimming clipper, a real work horse in a Salon.</li>
      <li>Very precise, light, easy to use.</li>
      <li>The fact that it&#x27;s on a cord and not wireless is what keeps it going strong.</li>
      <li>If youre using it to shave kids hair or get down to stubble before a shave it might work perfect for you.</li>
      <li>I was in need of a new pair of clippers, and these were on sale right on time at a great price.</li>
      <li>This is the best little trimmer you can buy.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really cheap.</li>
      <li>Good for kids and people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Not for a full haircut but indispensable for trimming around the neck and ears.</li>
      <li>I dropped the original one breaking it.</li>
      <li>Originally, My dad had one of these</li>
      <li>The best small pair of clippers I ever used.</li>
      <li>Also, the motor (you can see when you push the blade off) is very similar to a cheap battery operated nose hair clipper - i actually laughed when i saw it.</li>
      <li>This means I cant use it to clean up between haircuts around my ears and neck.  </li>
      <li>My husband was getting his hair cut every two weeks, but now, with the Peanut, he is able to make a haircut last longer by trimming his own at home.  </li>
      <li>Fits good in the hand, trims an entire head in 5 minutes without snagging.  </li>
      <li>probably only good to keep around as a spare.  </li>
      <li>And surprisingly it can substitute for my regular razor if I don&#x27;t need a close shave</li>
      <li>Does not get a super close edge.</li>
      <li>Personally, I will have one of these for my entire life, they are simpy the best.  </li>
      <li>love this trimmer and highly recommend it for beard and side-burn trimming, etc.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend paying the extra money for this great product.  </li>
      <li>It was exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>It is a little noisy, but seems to work great.</li>
      <li>Powerful.</li>
      <li>at the price point, it&#x27;s worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t let the size fool you, this things is seriously powerful.</li>
      <li>Small, easy to handle, good deal.</li>
      <li>Also the cord is about 6 feet long which is nice.</li>
      <li>This was purchased as a gift and is exactly what he was looking for.</li>
      <li>Use no guard and it trims almost to a shave, use the first guard</li>
      <li>My son looks so much tidier!</li>
      <li>This is even better than the last model I had!  </li>
      <li>It is exactly the trimmer that is used when he gets his hair cut.</li>
      <li>You might think the cord could be a hindrance, but it is actually a pretty generous length.</li>
      <li>Nice sharp cut.</li>
      <li>If it is really an issue (its not for me), then simply give the blade a quick dip in water, dry it, and your good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best beard trimmer I have ever used. I was on the fence about buying one with a cord sense I have gotten used to the cordless ones but after seeing the power and precision of this one I will never buy another. I have spent more than 100$ on other trimmers and they couldn&#x27;t hold a candle to this thing. Makes me sad that I cant buy more attachments for this thing but I knew that when i ordered it.</li>
    <li> Super-powerful and sharp compared to the Conair clippers I replaced with it, at 1/3 the weight.  Fits good in the hand, trims an entire head in 5 minutes without snagging.  Same as the white models that get rave reviews, just a different color.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift and is exactly what he was looking for. It is exactly the trimmer that is used when he gets his hair cut. Great product!</li>
    <li> Originally, My dad had one of these and I would always steal it.  Finally, he drove me to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supplies and I paid $50 for my own.  Let me tell you, it was one of the best investments I have ever made.  He got his years before I did and his still works like new.  Previously, I had bought a few different trimmers at marshalls and wal mart, the Peanut dwarfs the competition.  The blades have not noticeably dulled and the power is still the same.  I have even shaved my entire head with 3-4 inches of hair with this thing.  It is truly a bite-sized beast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with lubricating oil, a cleaning brush, and 4 different sized brush guards for different precision styling.  I only use this for my face and for trimming my chest.  The blade by itself will almost shave your face and you will barely have any noticeable hairs showing.  So, if you needed a quick shave but didnt have the time, these are absolutely perfect.  Also, these clippers do not require countless passes over the same area, they cut EXTREMELY well. They are also very easy to meanuever and are able to make those precise cuts in tough to reach spots that larger sized clippers cannot.  And yeah, it will heat up, but only under very, very heavy use.  If it is really an issue (its not for me), then simply give the blade a quick dip in water, dry it, and your good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you purchase this Peanut, you will never even think about another pair of grooming clippers.  Personally, I will have one of these for my entire life, they are simpy the best.  I highly recommend paying the extra money for this great product.  Do not be fooled by the size or the name, it is a lawnmower of a trimmer.</li>
    <li> my girlfriend needed parts, buying a new one was cheaper!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> This clipper is pretty awesome. I have owned this series now for over 8 years and it still does a great job. Powerful little machine.</li>
    <li> My husband was getting his hair cut every two weeks, but now, with the Peanut, he is able to make a haircut last longer by trimming his own at home.  We love it!</li>
    <li> There good trimmers but I&#x27;ve had better ones! Not what I expected!! But very good quality I should say :)</li>
    <li> What a nice little trimmer this ease.  Don&#x27;t let the size fool you, this things is seriously powerful. It clips closely, is very sharp but doesn&#x27;t nick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through three Andis clippers in the past two years and every of of them was junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this trimmer and highly recommend it for beard and side-burn trimming, etc.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the wahl peanut! I&#x27;m always ordering them for him (gets tired of it, gets another name brand, realizes it doesn&#x27;t work well, throws it out goes back to the peanut 3x). He tried many different types but he always seems to come back to the peanut. He purchased the  Wahl Professional 8081 5-star Series but it kept on nicking him in those hard to maneuver spots. This is a small clipper/trimmer but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Wahl Peanut for my hubby he already had one but it was about 10 years old and I thought it was about time for a new one. He loves his new Peanut he uses it almost everyday I always research a product before I buy online and amazon had the best price. I would definetly reccommend this product it will last a really long time I would know I took his old Wahl Peanut for myself its still going strong after 10 years.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmers. Love them!</li>
    <li> My husband loves his Wahl Peanut!!</li>
    <li> Does not trim as well as the previous Wahl Peanut Clippers-- seems the blades are not operating well.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband Christmas of 2010, and he still uses it on a daily basis. He absolutely loves it and it is easily the best trimmer he&#x27;s ever had, especially with his coarse hair (he&#x27;s half black and white).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To this day, he hasn&#x27;t had a problem with it. The fact that it&#x27;s on a cord and not wireless is what keeps it going strong. You might think the cord could be a hindrance, but it is actually a pretty generous length. My husband has never found it cumbersome. The size of the peanut is about 4&amp;#34; long, which makes it easy to travel with as well. It&#x27;s not too small for a guy&#x27;s big hands either. My husband is 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; and he thinks it fits in his hand well and the size allows him to get all the curves on his face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve never used this to cut hair, but I know my husband&#x27;s hairstylist has used it on his sides before. It&#x27;s what made him want it for his beard; for once, a razor didn&#x27;t uncomfortably catch on his hair. It went through like butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, at the price point, it&#x27;s worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This little peanut is still working like a dream. We have used it for his hair now. I wouldn&#x27;t use it to buzz someone&#x27;s entire head as it&#x27;s such a small size. It&#x27;s ideal for edging.  The peanut is a good investment. It lasts and is reliable.</li>
    <li> This is even better than the last model I had!  In fact, I am going to buy another one to use at my other home.</li>
    <li> I bought the black peanut with the cord for my husband for Christmas. He had been wanting one for quite some time &amp; I decided I needed to \\&quot;just get it already!\\&quot; Amazon had the best price on the product &amp; shipping that I could find &amp; he just loves it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I cut my son&#x27;s hair with this peanut and he has thick, wirey hair and this clipper struggles through it.  I have to get out larger clippers I have to do his hair.  This is just a little bit better than a toy and probably only good to keep around as a spare.  I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I had it to do over again.</li>
    <li> I was in need of a new pair of clippers, and these were on sale right on time at a great price.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin so I usually do not shave over the weekend.  So on Monday morning I have a couple of days growth.  My facial hair is very curly and after 3 days of growth an electric razor has a hard time.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this clipper/trimmer for 2 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1.  To trim the hair on my face to manageable length for my electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;2.  To edge my sideburns, around my ears, and the back of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer has not been able to meet my expectations for both.  It does not edge well and the when attempting to trim my beard after 3 days... nothing.&lt;br /&gt;This product may be a good set of small clippers, but that was not the reason that I purchased the clippers.</li>
    <li> Excellent clipper. Great for lining up the hairline. Nice sharp cut. My second pair of this clipper, no other compares.</li>
    <li> Very happy w it.  Powerful. Compact. Efficient,  close shave.  I like the way it feels in my hand.  And surprisingly it can substitute for my regular razor if I don&#x27;t need a close shave</li>
    <li> My barber swears by it.&lt;br /&gt;I got one for travel and ended up using it everyday to trim my beard.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, well built, powerful and sharp cutting action.</li>
    <li> easy to use, works great just as describe. Could be just a tad stronger but for the money it works good.</li>
    <li> Great edge trimming clipper, a real work horse in a Salon. Amazon has the best price in comparison to my local Beauty Supply Houses.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works well. It has enough power for by graying by the day beard.  I only wish it had a trimmer spacer between the lowest setting (thin cut) and the next trimmer space.  It comes with 4 - it could have used one that is a bit thinker than the day old beard setting.</li>
    <li> Does not trim as well as the previous peanut we owned. Considered sending it back.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this product...great set of clippers to own in your home or in a place of business...enough said.</li>
    <li> Loud but cuts. Probably would buy a more expensive professional one next time since  I am a professional... This one doesn&#x27;t quite pull off professional but it&#x27;s good t get the job done</li>
    <li> LOVE IT HE LOVES IT GREAT PRICE HE SAYS ITS THE BEST TRIMMERS HE HAS EVER HAD THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I had the trimmer for less than a month. Only used it 3 or 4 times and it stopped working. Won&#x27;t even turn on anymore</li>
    <li> great shaver. I have had several cordless shavers over the years and none cut like this little guy. nice size.</li>
    <li> I am looking for a clipper that would give me a very close trim for my head (almost shaved look).  After readying the reviews, i thought i would give this a try.  Result is not even close to what I was looking for.  I was so disppointed and would have returned it if i didn&#x27;t oil it up and try to use it.  Also, the motor (you can see when you push the blade off) is very similar to a cheap battery operated nose hair clipper - i actually laughed when i saw it.</li>
    <li> I usually by Oster trimmers.So I ordered these and they work well.&lt;br /&gt;They are sturdy. Not heavy like the Osters or cheap like the peanuts that come in white.I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> wow, this thing cuts so clean it is a much better blade setup then the other brands. The edge guards work well. My previous trimmer would almost want to shut off when my whiskers would grow out at all. This thing is like a Honda lawn mower, smooth as silk right through the super rough stuff. I can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
    <li> It worked great. I had one before and lasted many years. It was no question to get the same brand.</li>
    <li> A bit loud but is extremely fast and effective at cutting short hairs as well. Very useful for private parts.</li>
    <li> Handy item to have when you need it.</li>
    <li> love this little clipper!</li>
    <li> Small, easy to handle, good deal.</li>
    <li> Love the peanut trimmer but any time I&#x27;ve dropped it never works the same &amp; the blade attatchment always moves. Still a great trimmer!</li>
    <li> Paid for itself 100 fold.  I cut my own hair twice a week (keep my head shaved).  Very strong, heavy duty.  I&#x27;ve had it for almost 2 years with no issues.  And if you need guards, Amazon sells them http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UZEQFU/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1</li>
    <li> My son looks so much tidier! It is a little noisy, but seems to work great.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;Peanut\\&quot; clipper/trimmer from Wahl is great for keeping my beard neatly groomed.  Professionals need professional tools, and this one is \\&quot;well suited\\&quot; to keep you looking your best.</li>
    <li> Excellent, magnificent. The best small pair of clippers I ever used. When using them you don&#x27;t have to worry about being cut by blade</li>
    <li> Trims the neckline and other areas with ease.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> Im sure it would be good for some peoples needs, but not mine.  The way the teeth are cut its difficult to use as an edger. This means I cant use it to clean up between haircuts around my ears and neck.  All previous trimmers I had worked fine for this.  The guards are just lousy.  They are cheap of course, but the sizes are atrocious. Use no guard and it trims almost to a shave, use the first guard and youll have half inch hair.  This makes it really useless to keep my day old scruff looking good, which is what i bought it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, it is powerful and cuts well. If youre using it to shave kids hair or get down to stubble before a shave it might work perfect for you.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my college student.  He doesn&#x27;t like traditional shaving/razors due to skin irritation.  This gives a good shave without the skin irritation. Compact size is perfect for college student.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It is definitely professional quality but I bought it for home use. It works great, recommended product!</li>
    <li> Broke after 3 months. Won&#x27;t purchase another.</li>
    <li> This is the best little trimmer you can buy. All the professionals use them. Not for a full haircut but indispensable for trimming around the neck and ears.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product..and how fast it was delivered.....awesome customer satisfaction</li>
    <li> Solid compact durable comfortable clipper.  Fits very well in one&#x27;s hand; half the size of many unnecessary large clippers.  It is all you need.  Excellent product.  I would never buy a battery-operated (or chargeable) clipper; too little power.</li>
    <li> A really professional clipper for home use. Don&#x27;t waste money on the cheap ones from the drug store.</li>
    <li> I use this to trim my beard. Amazing little thing! Works great and it&#x27;s really cheap. Also the cord is about 6 feet long which is nice. Been using it for several months now without issues.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, very good power for the size. Good for kids and people with sensitive skin. Does not get a super close edge. I&#x27;d recommend wahl 5star detailers for that, or andis t-outliners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.facebook.com/AngeloTheBarber89</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Norelco trimmer I bought a couple years ago, and now I wish I had bought this sooner. This works much better than my previous trimmer. Without a guard, this trims very close, and sharp enough and powerful enough to make a quick trim quick and easy. My old trimmer also used to cut me occasionally, but I don&#x27;t see this as an issue with this trimmer, as the openings for the blades are much smaller. I don&#x27;t even min that this isn&#x27;t cordless because now I don&#x27;t have to worry about a dead battery in the morning, or waiting for a crappy NiCad battery to wear down enough to put on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this thing is amazing, and considering that this is a commercial grade trimmer for less cost than the average consumer grade (battery powered) trimmer, I am beyond happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace one I bought about five years ago from a professional hair stylist.  It did a great job of trimming my beard and mustache during that time. I dropped the original one breaking it. I paid less for the one I bought through Amazon and it works great.</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer. Use it to shape up the little facial hair my baby-face self was blessed with lol. Very precise, light, easy to use. Only issue is you can&#x27;t even wet it a little bit or it rusts like crazy, so when you clean it DRY IT ASAP. Other than that this thing is top quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product and work so well.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, works great. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;If anything, I would like it to include an extra cutting guide in between sizes 2 and 3. But this does not change the fact that this is an awesome item.</li>
    <li> Great awsome...... easy to use</li>
    <li> This is the second Peanut my hubby has had, only because he lost the first one while traveling. He says it is an awesome trimmer, it gets nice and close.</li>
