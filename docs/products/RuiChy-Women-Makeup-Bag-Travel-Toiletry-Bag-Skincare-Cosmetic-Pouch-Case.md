<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly as described and helping me to stay organized.</li>
    <li> Cheap.  Didn&#x27;t hold up.  Good idea, though.</li>
    <li> Stitching a little off but for the price a great buy!</li>
    <li> Just ordered 2 more.  For  the price, you can&#x27;t beat it! Good size.  Good for makeup being carried in and out of large purse :)</li>
    <li> A bit small but keeps everything organized.</li>
    <li> super great and is true, I can find everything...I LOVED.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the quality of the material. Has good storage and it fits perfectly inside my handbag.  Now I have two zipper compartments and multiple slots, there&#x27;s a big open spot for my wallet. The only problem I had is the zippers are plastic and does not always zip smoothly.</li>
    <li> This is an okay bag organizer.  Love the amount of pockets.  The only drawback is the nylon or stitching doesn&#x27;t seem to be of the best quality.  I have placed my wallet in the zipper section and you can see that it might rip at the seams, either it needed to be double stitched or the quality of the nylon isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
    <li> Love it, so many pockets to hold everything in one place, even some with zippers to close off things not used often. Easy to transfer between purses or totes.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable quality!  Extremely well made - padded; great zippers.  bottom unsnaps to provide 3&amp;#34; gusset for bigger items... camera,  glasses, even in a big case! Side pockets also padded and large!  (I have Samsung Galaxy s4 and it fits great, with EASY access.  Even my wallet fits in this thing.  I know some reviews said there was no padding, which was one reason I order the grey...all those reviews looked good.  But, I might take my chance on another color, just because I love this so much and might keep one packed esp. for travel.</li>
    <li> The only bad thing I can say is that it takes a long time to get this delivered. I had been looking on and off for a few years for a purse organizer but found them expensive. This was cheap! The color was what I was looking for my Fossil tote bag. The bag was big but getting keys or phone was a problem. A few spots of uneven stitching but I really loved the handles and lots of compartments made up for it. I might need to get in a few more colors for my other hobo style purses.</li>
    <li> Wanted one of these for when I went on vacation and it was awesome I had room for everything it was bigger than I expected</li>
    <li> great.... It holds lots of things..price is great also..plan to order more</li>
    <li> Its a nice bag but it did not fit my expectations</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described. Love it .great for gifts. Will probably order more.</li>
    <li> It held everything I placed on it,used it when we went on vacation. my phone,my money,my cards,my make-up,lipstick. It lived up to its name.i,m recommending it to my friends.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best things I have ever bought!  I change purses alot so this really comes in handy. Will be ordering more</li>
    <li> functional. zipper is very bright yellow. not ridged but for the price am happy</li>
    <li> Making my purse more organize!</li>
    <li> it is exactly as advertised.  For me, though, it is hard to remember into which pocket i put things!</li>
    <li> Works great for holding my coupons and accessories</li>
    <li> I never got it so would not know but not will since they got money and I got nothing so far still waiting</li>
    <li> At first, the product looked worth more than the $3+ I paid.  After all, it includes shipping cost from China.  Then, the first time I put my loose stuffs inside and try the tiny handles, the inside layer ripped open from the stitches.  It is not because the stuffs are too heavy.  The total weight of everything inside is about half pound.  I took a closer look.  The fabric is ok.  The cut is not right. There is no rim between the stitches and the side of the fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still works as the organizer inside my bag.  But when it is time to replace it, I will looking for something with better quality.</li>
    <li> previously i had ordered a different color (orange) &amp; it came from a different manufacturer &amp; it was larger &amp; better made.&lt;br /&gt;this one was quite a bit smaller &amp; the inside seam was not sewn properly along one side but i can still use it.&lt;br /&gt;this bag concept is very functional for a couponer who doesn&#x27;t want to carry around one of those big, heavy binders.</li>
    <li> my purse is ALWAYS ALWAYS junky and this is such a big help and I can keep up with my coupons.</li>
    <li> Recommended 100 % as I can without worrying change portfolio , excellent.</li>
    <li> I love it and will buy another one.</li>
    <li> Great for use in med-large size bags/totes&lt;br /&gt;Wish the shipping was faster...it took so long I forgot that I ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;Love all of the compartments and the handles. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for  a way to stay organized as you quickly change from bag to bag.</li>
    <li> If your purse is too big, it falls over and dumps everything out. You really need to have a purse that has 2 sections so the divider in the purse holds the bag up.</li>
    <li> Great for quick bag changes! This is my second one. The price is reasonable and I will order more as gifts</li>
    <li> This is not very useful- it feels flimsy.  I wouldn&#x27;t put anything heavy in it.</li>
    <li> Very handy to use when changing purses.  Just grab it and put it in another purse and then you&#x27;re off.</li>
    <li> The zipper is poor quality. Gave problems from the start.</li>
    <li> Just received this.  Product feels sturdy and the pockets are great for organizing.  I tossed what was in my purse, organized it inside the organizer and now I know where everything is in my purse without having to dig for it.</li>
    <li> Takes a while to get but it is well made and works.</li>
    <li> Very nice piece fits into my purse perfect, has lots of compartments and lots of room I an find everything easy in my purse now.</li>
    <li> Lining ripped after a few weeks of normal use. Would not reccommend. My friend gave me an extra purse organizer she got from QVC, love it. The one from QVC is made from heavy duty canvas not nylon.</li>
    <li> Works great; looks just as described; i think i&#x27;ve just decided i&#x27;m more of a throw my stuff in my purse than an organized person</li>
    <li> The purse organizer is not quite as the picture indicates.  Still very useful for having an organized purse.  Thank you</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok. Not really what I wanted. But it serves the purpose of organizing. One way to improve this product is to make it more sturdy.</li>
    <li> Loves it I keep coupons I find in here and use this for specific grocery store trips</li>
    <li> This purse organizer is small enough to dit in a medium to small bag. It was only a few bucks so I don&#x27;t mind hpw flimsy it is. It still does the job of keeping my purse more organized.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe what I received for the price, this purse insert is great ordered more and for gifts.</li>
    <li> It fits great in my new tote, Becky</li>
    <li> Love it! It holds alot more than I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandmother and she LOVES it. She is able to put all the things she needs in this organizer and move it from purse to purse. She is so happy about it</li>
    <li> it is almost a gift. for the price it is really a good product. i just wish they have more neutral colors that can´t notice inside the purse.</li>
    <li> USE MINE FOR COUPONS... SMALLER THAN I TOUGHT BUT I LIKE IT... NOT TO BAD AT ALL. IT GOES INSIDE MY REGULAR BAG</li>
    <li> I ordered two of the handbag inserts because I was not certain how many I would need to corral my purse items.  Turns out one is sufficient so I&#x27;ll find another use for insert number two.  I like the numerous openings for storage, and I&#x27;ve filled them all with my miscellany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is gray, and the zippers are bright yellow.  I&#x27;m not thrilled with the colors.  Also the zippers do not open easily, and I applied WD40 to keep the zippers moving properly.  That helped considerably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall satisfied with the insert.  Does a good job of organizing my stuff, and it is handy to pull out the insert with everything in tack.</li>
    <li> Very practical, good finished and reliable material.</li>
    <li> Works great to organize my purse.</li>
    <li> Appeared, but quality was less than described.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the handbag insert, it is well made and holds all the &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; I carry around and keeps items reachable.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Got here a lot quicker than I expected.&lt;br /&gt; It holds a lot and just does fit in my purse. Sturdy so far!</li>
    <li> Came broke,  I never thought going to be so poor and cheap quality. I WILL NEVER RECOMENDED:( don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This company is scamming customers. The reason they&#x27;ve been able to stay under the radar is due to the very low price they charge for the insert. They only charge a few dollars for this item, but they never send it. I ordered this item in December (2 months ago) and never received it. I filed a claim, so supposedly I&#x27;ll get a credit.</li>
    <li> Something was needed for organizing my make-up in the bathroom vanity and this was it!  This was the best item I&#x27;ve purchased for under $5 to keep me organized!</li>
    <li> I was happy I bought this product and liked it very much as it&#x27;s super handy. I liked the usefulness of it so much I got two of them. One I was using as a purse organizer and the other I was using to organize my hair stuffs, like combs, brushes, pins, clips, bows and rubber bans, and things like that so I could carry to the bathroom, bedroom, back and forth without worrying about forgetting something. It&#x27;s a clever design with lots of compartment choices. However, the material is fragile and it needs to be handled with too much care. Daily usage  eventually ripped it and is now being unused. If you buy, be extra gentle with it.</li>
    <li> Wife loved it!!!! was just what she was looking for!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it! you can change you handbags very easily from moving it from bag to bag.</li>
    <li> Useful  for a quick change of handbag and having my things handy.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> Very useful handbag organizer insert -  I am very pleased with it.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Pretty practical. So far I&#x27;ve been using it to organize the kids&#x27; snacks in my bag. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I bought this to go in a purse that was about the same width, but taller and deeper. As soon as I started putting things in the pockets, they would flop over. It doesn&#x27;t keep things standing inside the purse. I even tried adding a piece of cardboard to the bottom to make it more sturdy and it didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think maybe if I had a smaller purse that was closer to the size of the organizer, it might work... but it&#x27;s definitely useless in a deep purse where you lose things often. I found a better organizer on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love my Handbag organizer. This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned. Makes life easier and finding items in my purse a breeze.</li>
    <li> make changing purse super easily. Like it. big enough for me. my friend also got one and like it. happy for my purchase.</li>
    <li> This was shipped from China and it took a few weeks but arrived perfectly! I should have bought more!</li>
    <li> Great to use, I can organize my bag better!&lt;br /&gt; The quality is good for this price</li>
    <li> I love this organizer! It fits great in those &amp;#34;bag&amp;#34; type purses and doesnt allow your stuff to constantly float around the bottom! Love it!</li>
    <li> As an organizer, this piece is perfect for me.  It is soft and delicate and yet it holds everything perfectly.  It perfectly organize my personal belongings sitting inside of my weekender bag.  This is the perfect organizer and I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.  Amazon and Seller, awesome job and price!</li>
    <li> Excellent price. And excellent tool to keep your purse organized.</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d discovered this product years ago! Finally I can keep the inside of my purses clean, and well organized. The best part is I can lift it out and put it right inside another purse, which makes changing pocketbooks practical and easy for a change.</li>
    <li> good idea - but totally didn&#x27;t help me stay organized  .... i thought about it and realized im a lost cause :-) i can try to change , but i have to get some professional help :-)</li>
    <li> Worked very well. Fit inside my coach and gave me plenty of pockets to keep things in order.  Would have liked it better in black but grey works just fine.</li>
    <li> I ordered one for myself and than, when I received it and LOVED IT SO MUCH, I ordered 2 more for my 2 friends. Quality and price are super. This organizer is what I did needed for a long time since i am big fan of large and extra large bags and love to carry all my stuff with me. I love everything about this organizer, the size, the capacity, the easiness with which you can transfer it from one or your bag to another in one move. Really, have nothing more to say that I LOVE IT SO MUCH.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is super nice! It holds so much and is made very well! Nice zipper pockets on the outside, lots of room! This makes switching purses so easy! I love this!</li>
    <li> For the price, this was much better quality than I was expecting!  It looks exactly like the picture, made with padded nylon, mesh, plastic zippers, and plastic snaps.  For the price, with free shipping, it&#x27;s worth the wait.  Mine even arrived earlier than expected.  I will order a couple more for gifts.</li>
    <li> You know I love these little organizing bags and I bought a whole bunch of them.  I have been giving them away as time goes so it was a month after receiving that I opened one to give to my daughter for a new bag she had gotten when we discovered that one of the snaps didn&#x27;t work.  I contacted the company and they immediately wrote back and said, &amp;#34;too late, sorry!&amp;#34;  I wrote again and told them I bought so many and it was just one snap if they could just tell me if there was a way to fix it, to let me know and I&#x27;d do it myself, or if they could send me a new snap to match, something!  That was now over 1 month ago and they have chose to ignore me.  Bad practice!  I would have continued to purchase these from them, because they are well made and useful for a variety of things, great for donating to the schools for desk organization for the children, etc..., but never again from this place!  Good thing these are made through other companies as well!</li>
    <li> Saw a similar one on TV shopping network, very happy with this, lots of room and sturdy. Will protect inside of your purse.</li>
    <li> No complaints. I thought it was going to be too small at first but then i put ot in my bag and it was the perfect fit. The seams were good, the quality is better than what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I ever bought for daily use it is easy to transfer and and change my purses.</li>
    <li> The size is perfect for all my large bags to keep things organized-so they do not fall into the bottomless abyss. It is so light it does not add any weight to my bags and the lighter colour makes it easy to see it and the things I have in it.  I find it so easy to move from bag to bag.  I once just took it without my bag for a quick errand....  Very nice and the service was great-fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Item was delivered on time. It works as expected--great idea! I really like using it for organizing all the items I put in my purse. It allows me to quickly switch purses without forgetting anything! The reason for the three star rating is it was poorly made. When it arrived I noticed the handles were different lengths for the hanbag. After a week of use, one of the handles frayed and came off.</li>
    <li> This great if you change pursed a lot!!</li>
    <li> It is very &amp;#34;rustic&amp;#34; looking.  It took a long time to ship and the stitching is very amateurish.  I ordered two and they were both the same way.</li>
    <li> I ordered a grey one and a wine-red one, but they sent me a green one instead of the grey, and the red one is not wine red at all, not as shown on the picture.</li>
    <li> VERY FRUSTRATING TO USE IT TENDS TO SQUASH DOWN IN THE BAG ZIPPERS ARE HARD TO WORK,YDAY USENOT FOR THE EVER</li>
    <li> This organizer is smaller than I had expected but I love having it in my purse. I just got it today and got things organized and I love it already. Just hope it holds up well.</li>
    <li> Took a while to arrive, but it was expected, as that&#x27;s what the &amp;#34;arrival&amp;#34; date said. (Close to a month to arrive.) We ordered 2 of them, one was perfect, one of them - the zippers wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I am an organizational person. I carry big bags with everything in it&#x27;s place.&lt;br /&gt;I love this.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit small for me, but I would buy it all over again.</li>
    <li> Lots of pockets...a place for everything.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the yellow zipper...I would have preferred grey or black.</li>
    <li> love this purchase, helps keep me organized and easy to transfer from one purse to another.  would recommend this to all women!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Perfect insert for my larger purses.</li>
    <li> Best purse organizer money can buy.  I purchased as a gift for my sisters and they love it!  I have one and will always use them, because they are so convenient.  It makes changing from one purse to the next, so easy!</li>
    <li> Has a lot of compartments and very good for organization.  Only complaint is the terrible color choices.</li>
    <li> OK so i bought this as not as a purse organzier but to hold my toiletries. Bought it in gray and yellow to since it looked masculine. Hold all my products great organzier plenty of room. Quality is OK not great but not bad either. However since it is from hong kong do expect it to take a long time for shipping took almost 3-4 weeks for mine to arrive.</li>
    <li> These handbag inserts are easily one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I love to match my purse to my outfit and it takes me just a few seconds to change over when I use an insert.  They also make it easier to find things in a hurry- I don&#x27;t have to dig around for my cell phone or my lipstick.  They make a thoughtful little gift, too.</li>
    <li> Like the pockets but size is smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> Nice bag. It works in my Michael Kors tote and purse. I can easily move from one bag to another. I would order more.</li>
