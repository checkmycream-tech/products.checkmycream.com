<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this primarily for the spoolie, which is why I like it. I don&#x27;t like the brow comb and brush as much, they don&#x27;t seem to work for me. I wish the brush was made of metal.</li>
    <li> Excellent mascara brush. One end smoothes&lt;br /&gt;mascara &amp; other end removes lumps &amp; clumps!</li>
    <li> Ha this is so sturdy. I love the quality of this, Its actually very useful as a spoolie and saves the need for me to buy another one as it is 2 in 1</li>
    <li> A sturdy brush and in a more compact length that makes it good for traveling</li>
    <li> This is a great product to help straighten out my lashes and eye brows wonderfully. The multiple brushes/comb help with any situation. I don&#x27;t know how I did it before this brush.</li>
    <li> Very good value and good quality</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great for taming and grooming my eyebrows. Seems sturdy. Easy to clean. I liked that it was three in one. Much better to bring this one item with me when I travel instead of three different brushes.</li>
    <li> i was looking for all 3 of these feature in 1 brush &amp; i found it. super happy with my purchase. thank you</li>
    <li> This product is very versatile.</li>
    <li> it works and the little brush is great for the eyebrow. best product of its kind on the market today.</li>
    <li> It has already broken :-(&lt;br /&gt;So disappointing!</li>
    <li> I found out about this item from a You Tube makeup video, the girl used this after she applied her eyebrow pencil to smooth it out.  She used the swirly part and it did help tone done the look so it does not look so fake.</li>
    <li> This multi-use brush is an amazing buy and a necessary component to eyebrow grooming.</li>
    <li> This is a brow brush.  I love it and it works great.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that there are 3 brush types. This is a nice quality and has not lost bristles. Works great.</li>
    <li> Really useful tool.  I have eyelash extensions and this works perfectly.  Solidly made and totally worth the small investment.</li>
    <li> Great quality and great price. Gets the job done</li>
    <li> It does have what ever brush heads I wanted for trimming eyebrows. I only wish the neck between the stick and the tubal brush was a bit thicker because my first brush broke in my cosmetic pouch from that part.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Great quality. Does the job well</li>
    <li> I use this brush to remove clumps from my mascara and it works perfectly</li>
    <li> I used to have to replace these things every few months for some reason. The teeth would break from the comb or the head would crack &amp; then fall off. Mind you I use them only once a day when I&#x27;m doing my make up &amp; then they just sit in my makeup bag at home. This lasted for nearly a year before needing a replacement. A great value for the money - especially if you get it with subscribe &amp; save.  I love the dual heads, you can get both brows &amp; lashes combed with one tool. Great for blending your eyebrow pencil or powder in for a more natural look, also brushes brows into a clean line which I love. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Have tried numerous other combs to separate eyelashes &amp; none worked as well as this one.  I was able to buy one in store years ago but unable to find it since. Was happy to be able to buy it online. I would definitely recommend this eyelash comb.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve needed this for a long time, but was too lazy to buy it.  If you need to tame your eyebrows, this is the brush for you!</li>
    <li> I did not even drop it, half of the comb just broke off for no reason, in a few days since I got it. I think the product is made of very bad plastic. I am completely disappointed.</li>
    <li> Really nice brush, does the job required to do. No complainments.</li>
    <li> I have had this for awhile now and I have zero complaints! I used to have these tools separate so I had to remember to carry around 3 different tools when I traveled, but this tool makes it so much easier because it is 3 in 1. The brush bristles are nice and sturdy and not too hard or too soft, it makes eyebrow grooming so much easier. I love this product and I&#x27;m thinking about buying another for backup.</li>
    <li> The brush is nicer than ones i&#x27;ve see in stores.  am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The questions asked about application are stupid for this product--it is not make-up; it is a brush.  My gripe is that it is marketed as an eyebrow brush and it is much larger than most eyebrow brushes.  It is too big for comfortable or detailed eyebrow grooming.  And it is hard and rough and scratchy.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this. Easy to use and versatile. Being able to use on my brows and lashes is a plus.</li>
    <li> This is well made - I&#x27;ve bought cheaper one on Amazon and the the little comb teeth broke off on it pretty quickly.  This one is still perfect even after a few months of daily use, and I love the tip with the eyelash brush on the end instead of it just being a plain handle - it&#x27;s great for making sure your lashes look good after applying mascara, to unclump any areas needed (works better than the comb or brush for that purpose).  Spend a little extra and get this brush.    Update 12/4/14: It&#x27;s still in perfect shape!</li>
    <li> Very good quality.  Helps tame my brows and separate my lashes.  Nice tool.  Not much else to say but Thanks!</li>
    <li> Amazing brow brush, has lasted me for years! About to purchase it again. Also useful for lashes!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT brush.  Both ends of the brush come in handy when applying my makeup.  The brush part helps me keep my eyelashes from being all stuck together and the other end is great for brows.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. Best all in one for doing make up or just regular grooming on the eyelashes or eye brows. Easy to clean. This should be a must have for all who likes to groom and wear makeup. Seriously this would make the perfect gift for any one at any age. This is something that they might now know they need. It&#x27;s just a very useful tool to have. Would make a great gift, stocking stuffer, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have other brands grooming tool that don&#x27;t have the mascara wand on it. I am always reaching for this grooming tool when doing my make up or just for regular grooming. I find this tool easy to use and comforting. It has everything I need on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at a store locally about 4 years ago, Still holding up strong. none of the plastic comb part has broken off yet. the brush part is not worn out.  The red paint has not chipped nor has the paint faded away. Still in pristine shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I so hope that Relvon keeps this tool for a long long time. One of the best products out there.</li>
    <li> good solid brush, use it for eyebrows mostly, it was a good price.</li>
    <li> i love it and works great</li>
    <li> LOVE !!!!! works great!!</li>
    <li> I love that this is double sided and has all the &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; your peepers will need. Nice quality for a plastic piece!</li>
    <li> I like that this is a 3-in-1 brush. Eyebrow brush and comb. Eyelash brush and comb. Only problem is if you do get mascara on the eyelash brush, the next time you handle it, you tend to get mascara on your hand.</li>
    <li> My favorite thing ever. I loved it! I&#x27;m the type to chunk on mascara and have that sort of spider leg look and it does its job. Bought it twice mainly because I lost my first one. Have not broken it yet and so far I love it</li>
    <li> mostly use it to brush eyebrows for trimming</li>
    <li> Love this brow brush. It does double duty, brushes your brows and the tip brushes your lashes. I especially like using the tip after I apply mascara, it separates the lashes and removes the extra mascara that clumps. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> This brow/lash brush is my very favorite eye grooming tool!  It&#x27;s an all-in-one implement that I use every day and it is very well made - the comb and brush are strong and don&#x27;t lose teeth/hair as other of my former brushes have always done!  The eyebrow grooming end is the best one I have ever found.  This tool looks like it will last a long time - I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Does the trick, although I&#x27;d like for the coiled end to be a little thicker/sturdier, but that&#x27;s just personal preference.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning on my brows in tandem with an angled brush that I use to apply a powder. I start with this double ended brush and finish with it. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a brow brush before so this isn&#x27;t a review of comparisons as much as it is one of expectations. I expect a brow brush to be able to brush my eyebrows into place without being harsh on my skin. This brush does its job but the bristles are quite rough. It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s double ended for all your eyebrow needs but I would highly prefer a softer brush.</li>
    <li> This is useful for grooming the eyelashes and eyebrows. Be sure to store the pointed brush tip in alcohol or peroxide and dip the sweeping brush in it too periodically (wiping them off in tissue before using). Also great for declumping lashes of excess mascara. I would also recommend this to parents who young girls beg or borrow mascara. Used with petroleum jelly, it achieves much the same effect. Not for old ladies like me. My lower lashes went white after I hit 50. I use mascara to darken the lashes and brows.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. It works well and does what it was described to do.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush and lash comb/brush.  It&#x27;s well made, does what it says and works fine.  Let&#x27;s hope it lasts as my previous brushes have all broken off.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Revlon Double ended Brow Brush:&lt;br /&gt;I bought this brush to replace a folding brush I had, this will stay in a hard makeup case and I keep it in the&lt;br /&gt;plastic sleeve for cleanliness.  So you have the eyelash comb, the teeth are quite sharp and appear to be&lt;br /&gt;made of plastic.  I add this because the folding one I had was metal. The brow brush is angled bristles ,&lt;br /&gt;not too soft or not too firm. I really like the mascara type wand at the end, I don&#x27;t use mascara often&lt;br /&gt;but do curl my lashes on occassion and use the wand to finish off the look. I think this is one of those tools&lt;br /&gt;every makeup case needs.  All in all I feel I paid a fair price and am happy with the product and timely delivery.</li>
    <li> Maybe it is me or the product(s) I have tried this on, but it did NOT do what I was buying it for, and what it is presumed to be able to do, and this is smooth out any lashes and get clumps out or your lashes...It rather gets stuck in your lashes and then you have to figure out  how to remove the brush so you don&#x27;t pull your lashes out in the process! I was using a waterproof mascara, which may be slightly  thicker and gummier than your average more water-based, thinner mascara, but for me it was not a good purchase due to the type of mascara that I use...</li>
    <li> Well, this certainly is a new must have in my beauty kit! This double ended brow brush is wonderful! The spoolie brush puts my eyebrows in the perfect position for grooming and penciling in.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic brush works well on eyelashes, and I&#x27;m sure it would work well on brows as well.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely keeping this baby!&lt;br /&gt;There really isn&#x27;t a bad thing to say about this tool!</li>
    <li> This product handles eyebrows and lashes so well. Easy to comb/brush wet eyebrows so they stay in place right out of the shower. Easy to fix mascara clumping with clean dry mascara type brush on the end. Well made. Bought one for myself and each of my daughters, who also love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an eyebrow brush with an eyelash brush on the opposite end. It works great and is decently priced. What else do you want?</li>
    <li> I use it every day and will continue to buy because its a product that needs to be replaced every three months or so.</li>
    <li> This should be in every girls makeup bag. A smaller version than some, but great for carrying around. Highly function, multi-purpose. Grab one of these.</li>
    <li> Exactly as shown online and this item does just was is advertised.  I have been looking for such a product and glad I found it on this site.</li>
    <li> I like this brush but it&#x27;s kind of flimsy, I feel like it&#x27;s going to break every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Definitely not a bad brow brush! I like the spoolie end, because it blends my brow powder to give my brows a natural look. I also like the lash seperator/mascara de-clumper. It works very well at breaking up mascara clumps. I don&#x27;t use the comb a lot, but it&#x27;s pretty sturdy.  The only con I can think of is that the spoolie is a little too harsh. Sometimes it irritates my skin. But it&#x27;s not too much of a problem. This whole product is pretty good quality! I&#x27;m surprised since it wasn&#x27;t very expensive. I would purchase again! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 months now, and it hasn&#x27;t broke yet.</li>
    <li> There are 3 seperate surfaces on this brush, so you can use it for different purposes.  Well made and convenient.</li>
    <li> My gloves arrived quickly and I&#x27;m really happy with them. The fit is great and they protect my hands very well while working in my garden (including rose bushes).</li>
    <li> No matter what mascara I use, I am extremely particular about any clumping whatsoever in my lashes. I want all of my lashes to be seperate, and this is perfect for combing out my lashes between mascara applications. I don&#x27;t use the brow brush much, but I do use the mascara wand end to comb out my eyebrows after applying my eyebrow pencil.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to any girl I know! I&#x27;m noit one of those crazy girly types but this is a staple in any make-up bag for sure! The metal comb is THE BEST.</li>
    <li> This does the purpose it was intended for.....brush brow hairs in place.  The price was good and it was just more convenient to purchase it online than look for one at the stores.</li>
    <li> As described - really like it. Shaped my brows.</li>
    <li> I wish the middle part were a little shorter, as the brush seems unnecessarily long. And while it definitely costs a little more than your average lash/brow brush, both ends work well and it has held up far better than most similar items I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
    <li> I needed a new spooley since I&#x27;ve been using the mini one in the NYX Browcake kit. So far that one has been my favorite in a while. This one is good, but I think it&#x27;ll take a while for me to get used to the long handle.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye brow brush out there.  It evens out my eyebrow makeup and is very sturdy.  I would by this again.</li>
    <li> this product does what its intended to do.  the quality is good and does not seem cheap.  so far I like it and have not seen any problems or issues with it.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this brow brush.  I am especially excited about the mascara-type wand on the end.  It works perfectly to brush my brows back into place after filling them in with brow pencil or powder.  A friend suggested spraying the wand with a bit of hairspray before using it on my brows, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.  I don&#x27;t want to get it gunked up.  All in all, the brush is very versatile and fits my needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to find this brow brush anywhere but Amazon. Best one I have found!</li>
    <li> The brow brush is great quality for the price. Love that it is a double ended brush. Overall, very satisfied with purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this brush and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I love that I can use this for my eyebrows and eyelashes without having two separate tools.</li>
    <li> Solidly made, easily stored, good price.  I use it strictly for eyebrows.  The brush part is a nice way to get any excess off from when I fill in my eyebrows.  Makes the filling look more natural.  I&#x27;ve not used the eyelash comb since I have a metal one I&#x27;ve used for years and is my preference.</li>
    <li> The comb portion broke early.  the plastic is very brittle.  It works, but not made of the best quality: I suggest shopping around for one that willlast a little longer.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyebrow brush I have ever owned. I love the mascara brush part of it, so much better for getting globs off my lashes than the usual comb only, brushes.</li>
