      <li>Also think my Mama would love it too!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It is very easy to apply and blend.  </li>
      <li>Love this product, compact, creamy, beautiful colors that goes on smooth and can blend easily.  </li>
      <li>I put it on right over my moisturizer and it blends in great.  </li>
      <li>it blends easily on the cheeks and makes a nice stain on the lips...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for rouge for years, and love this product.</li>
      <li>Not garish or overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>I love it...</li>
      <li>My thumb has smudged it so many times, as much as I love it</li>
      <li>The tin is lovely as well.</li>
      <li>I love how, this rouge doubles as a lip tint, and</li>
      <li>The best part is, you can get away with just a touch of color, so it will last forever!</li>
      <li>It gives you the perfect shade of red that looks like you are truly blushing.</li>
      <li>Dewy finish or matte with powder on top.  </li>
      <li>As a vintage beauty and style enthusiast, I&#x27;ve heard a lot about Besame Cosmetics, but I haven&#x27;t been able to try them until now.  </li>
      <li>I was especially interested in the rouge.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Also the retro tin is cute.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is also lovely.</li>
      <li>I would love to love cream blushes, but I have combo skin and most of them either disappear under powder or melt away halfway through the day.  </li>
      <li>But the most overwhelming reason why I probably would never order it again is the lid.  </li>
      <li>I like that it&#x27;s easy to carry in your purse, and just as easy to touch up.</li>
      <li>Also was shipped very quickly.</li>
      <li>Really nice matte bright red.  </li>
      <li>With just a ever so slight wipe, my lips are perfect.  </li>
      <li>The formula is luxuriously smooth and creamy.  </li>
      <li>It is smooth to apply and has a light feel to it.</li>
      <li>Really nice color and very concentrated pigment</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, it is also more opaque and well-behaved than my only Besame *lipstick</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for daytime or night, with neutrals, bold eyes/lips, or with no other makeup at all.  </li>
      <li>Love this product but the cover of the case it comes in, although beautiful, is so tight</li>
      <li>bought this via Amazon because the Prime shipping was a significant savings in both time and money compared to those listed on the official Besame website.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a lot of rouge and it will last a good while.</li>
      <li>It can be used on lips and eyes too, for a nice natural all over glow.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product, its very girly and needed it in my life</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a true red colour that can be blended out into a beautiful, natural looking flush on any skin tone.</li>
      <li>Soft and creamy, with minimal drying, it&#x27;s very pleasant when applied with a brush.</li>
      <li>I have to say, I quite enjoy this blusher, and it&#x27;s very pigmented.</li>
      <li>Personally, I use this exclusively as a lip rouge; it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t think the color would work for a nice blush, but my cheeks are just quite rosy naturally, so anything more makes me look</li>
      <li>I was so pleased it was still available when my last container ran out.</li>
      <li>I love how natural this blush looks, and that it stays in place throughout the day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easily blended with fingers, a sponge or a brush, and blends seamlessly into foundation or skin.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff and will definitely purchase again.</li>
      <li>The color is lovely, and seems as though it would be pretty universal, but I am not a makeup expert of course.  </li>
      <li>Does double as a lipstain if applied lightly or sexy if applied generously.</li>
      <li>I finally gave up and keep it in my cosmetic drawer with the lid propped loosely on top.  </li>
      <li>However, it does not last all day ----or even most of the day.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty as rouge but can also be used as lip color.</li>
      <li>Finally, I realized that if I gently patted it on top of some highlighter- it seemed to blend the way I wanted.  </li>
      <li>its so large, the height  is about an inch</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very well pigmented, so it produces a stain that lasts all day, oily skin and all.  </li>
      <li>Got shipped fast</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an intense color</li>
      <li>This rouge is the deep red rose color</li>
      <li>Gives a nice flush when applied to cheeks and a pretty pink red when applied to lips.</li>
      <li>And the color is so intense, brighter and more vivid than I&#x27;d expected.</li>
      <li>At first I struggled to apply this product to look natural.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Blends easily and long lasting.</li>
      <li>Go as light and go as dark ar one pleases.</li>
      <li>I just look naturally rosy.  </li>
      <li>So natural.  </li>
      <li>Old time rouge doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>My last container wore down over time and was easy to open at the end</li>
      <li>yeah, it was nothing major</li>
      <li>However, the tin that it comes in - while pretty - tends to be difficult to fit back together once one has it open.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really think of it as blush so much as just that little splash of color that wakes up my face and keeps me from looking like one of the living dead.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love it! Wear lips, cheek, or fave. Go as light and go as dark ar one pleases. i love the vintage packaging too!</li>
    <li> Great multi-purpose product! Gives a nice flush when applied to cheeks and a pretty pink red when applied to lips. The tin is lovely as well. The only downside I can find is the tin is sort of hard to open. It has no lip to grab on to and the vaccum suction it creates tends to make it stick. Would be great for a vacation where you don&#x27;t want to be carrying a bunch of things!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I don&#x27;t really think of it as blush so much as just that little splash of color that wakes up my face and keeps me from looking like one of the living dead.  It is very easy to apply and blend.  The color is lovely, and seems as though it would be pretty universal, but I am not a makeup expert of course.  The best part is, you can get away with just a touch of color, so it will last forever!</li>
    <li> Personally, I use this exclusively as a lip rouge; it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t think the color would work for a nice blush, but my cheeks are just quite rosy naturally, so anything more makes me look clownish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lips, on the other hand... oh, how happy I am! This has become my newest go-to. Soft and creamy, with minimal drying, it&#x27;s very pleasant when applied with a brush. And the color is so intense, brighter and more vivid than I&#x27;d expected. Though I usually wear deeper blood-toned reds, this is a knockout that works with every color of clothing from brown to blue to purple. Surprisingly, it is also more opaque and well-behaved than my only Besame *lipstick* (Noir Red)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tin is, indeed, a bit snug, but not overly. I&#x27;d rather have it tight than loose, since it lives in my purse with my phone and wallet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this via Amazon because the Prime shipping was a significant savings in both time and money compared to those listed on the official Besame website.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheek rouge / stain that has staying power so I ordered Besame cream rouge.  It does go on very nicely and evenly, and it has a beautiful rosy hue.  However, it does not last all day ----or even most of the day.  But the most overwhelming reason why I probably would never order it again is the lid.  Sounds silly, but the lid is beyond difficult to put on and into the realm of the ridiculous.  I finally gave up and keep it in my cosmetic drawer with the lid propped loosely on top.  Because of this, I could never carry it in my purse to reapply during the day.  Put these two together, and I don&#x27;t think I would ever order this product again.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering this rouge.  I love it.  I put it on right over my moisturizer and it blends in great.  However, it takes such effort to open the tin container.  My last container wore down over time and was easy to open at the end but I stubble with this container every day. This rouge lasts at least one year.  I was so pleased it was still available when my last container ran out.</li>
    <li> Love this product but the cover of the case it comes in, although beautiful, is so tight it&#x27;s frustrating. My thumb has smudged it so many times, as much as I love it I would not order it again. Beautiful but not practical.</li>
    <li> I love how, this rouge doubles as a lip tint, and its so large, the height  is about an inch and the circumference is a little larger than  the size of a sliver dollar, over all it&#x27;s a lot of rouge and it will last a good while.</li>
    <li> Natural blush that gives a lot for a little bit of application. Does double as a lipstain if applied lightly or sexy if applied generously.</li>
    <li> With just a ever so slight wipe, my lips are perfect.  Another little swipe for the apples of my cheeks.  So natural.  I love it.  I&#x27;ve been wanting a gel or cream blusher that can also go on my lips.  TaDa!  This tin will last me forever (hope it doesn&#x27;t go bad).  Also the retro tin is cute.  I have no trouble getting it open as other reviewers have, but closing it...there is an air pocket which makes it weird for a moment, no biggie though!  If i ever run out i will buy again.  Also think my Mama would love it too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for rouge for years, and love this product. At age 65, powder blush and cream blush accumulate in and accentuate my wrinkles. Old time rouge doesn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t have the problem with the lid that others mention.</li>
    <li> This rouge is the deep red rose color my great grandmother wore.  It&#x27;s an intense color so use just a tiny bit.  The container is difficult to open...there are no catches or buttons to assist you.  For that reason, I got sick of it quickly and threw it away.</li>
    <li> Love this product, compact, creamy, beautiful colors that goes on smooth and can blend easily.  Just the perfect touch of blush on the cheek or lips; up to you how you want to use it.</li>
    <li> At first I struggled to apply this product to look natural.  Finally, I realized that if I gently patted it on top of some highlighter- it seemed to blend the way I wanted.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful rouge in a generous sized tin...it blends easily on the cheeks and makes a nice stain on the lips...I love it...</li>
    <li> Really nice color and very concentrated pigment so you don&#x27;t need to use much. It&#x27;s beautiful both as a blush and as a lip color. The packaging is also lovely. Also was shipped very quickly. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love how natural this blush looks, and that it stays in place throughout the day. I usually wear it over foundation, but under powder to tone it down. A little goes a long way! I like that it&#x27;s easy to carry in your purse, and just as easy to touch up. It also looks like it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> A little dab will do you. A little goes a long way. Blends easily and long lasting. Best when applied after foundation and before powder. Love the quality, beautiful, retro packaging!</li>
    <li> I have to say, I quite enjoy this blusher, and it&#x27;s very pigmented. It&#x27;s a true red colour that can be blended out into a beautiful, natural looking flush on any skin tone. However, the tin that it comes in - while pretty - tends to be difficult to fit back together once one has it open. That is, the lid will often catch between the outer ton and the inner tin, which actually holds the product. If one is using it on the lips, they&#x27;ll also need a balm, as it can be drying in that area... But the pigment is so wonderful, that&#x27;s a small sacrifice to make.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful vintage style cosmetic that is of very good quality. It&#x27;s pretty as rouge but can also be used as lip color. It is smooth to apply and has a light feel to it. It&#x27;s the bees knees in my book!</li>
    <li> Really nice matte bright red.  Not garish or overwhelming.  Looks great on lips and cheeks.  A little goes a long way.  The tin&#x27;s lid gives me problems when I try to put it back on.  However, I would still recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This rouge! It&#x27;s amazing! It gives you the perfect shade of red that looks like you are truly blushing. You hardly need any too! The packaging is beautiful as well. Love!</li>
    <li> As a vintage beauty and style enthusiast, I&#x27;ve heard a lot about Besame Cosmetics, but I haven&#x27;t been able to try them until now.  I was especially interested in the rouge.  I would love to love cream blushes, but I have combo skin and most of them either disappear under powder or melt away halfway through the day.  Not this one.  The formula is luxuriously smooth and creamy.  It&#x27;s easily blended with fingers, a sponge or a brush, and blends seamlessly into foundation or skin.  It&#x27;s very well pigmented, so it produces a stain that lasts all day, oily skin and all.  However, I haven&#x27;t gone dancing or running or done yard work with it on, so I can&#x27;t vouch for it&#x27;s staying power in those situations. It doesn&#x27;t disappear under powder.  It&#x27;s great for daytime or night, with neutrals, bold eyes/lips, or with no other makeup at all.  I&#x27;ve used it for a lazy day when I didn&#x27;t want a full face, but still wanted a little makeup, with a little mascara and just this.  I just look naturally rosy.  It can be used on lips and eyes too, for a nice natural all over glow.  The color is buildable, but a little goes a long way.  Dewy finish or matte with powder on top.  I love this stuff and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this!  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, its very girly and needed it in my life lol! Got shipped fast and I personally couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. The one lil thing was that the packaging was a lil damaged in the inside...yeah, it was nothing major but i like to keep my make-up especially in pristine shape.</li>
