      <li>When this item arrived I was very excited!</li>
      <li>But when you buy it then you discover that if you had any kind of dental treatment you cannot use this product.</li>
      <li>When I pluged it in, it worked great and the products still seemed fresh!    </li>
      <li>So I wanted to look my best for my high school reunion at Camp Crystal Lake</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t forget that a facelift costs around $12,000, so this is a really cheap [but effective] alternative!</li>
      <li>After 3 months the doctors were very happy with the progress and surprised.  </li>
      <li>My cheekbones look great and the feedback I get from friends and family proves it works.</li>
      <li>My eternal thanks for this product it is brilliant.</li>
      <li>The moisturizers are pretty good with an excellent list of [largely natural]ingredients, and no added perfumes.</li>

      <li>I was given the Rejuvenique as a \\&quot;Halloween\\&quot; present from one of my best friends.</li>
      <li>Even if you wanted this for interesting electro sensations, it&#x27;s garbage.</li>
      <li>The instructions say to start at 3, but I did at 2, just to be safe.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay though; wearing this mask out, I have pride, confidence, bravery.</li>
      <li>so I will purchase on an online auction site instead because the price is much better.</li>
      <li>I thought for sure</li>
      <li>The gel for the E-S electrodes is bascially el-cheapo K-Y jelly, which many of us already have in the nightstand.     </li>
      <li>and my face looks and feels better.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re going to use this product, make sure you are doing it correctly.</li>
      <li>god, how many people have you done this to?</li>
      <li>How many of you still have VHS.</li>
      <li>It is okay..</li>
      <li>and it is absolutely FABULOUS!</li>
      <li>so one can stay more motivated to use the Product.  </li>
      <li>If you want firmer facial features, a more chisled look, then this is the best product you could ever</li>
      <li>so many junk products like it</li>
      <li>you can do better than this....</li>
      <li>So, good try, but more useful as an instrument of torture, and or to creep out whoever walks into your livingroom while you have it on.</li>
      <li>I thought for sure</li>
      <li>Whilst on holiday in Alaska I decided to try once more and this time I was sucessful.  </li>
      <li>As an ex-[champion]athlete, I have used Electro-Stim (E-S) devices many times for muscle and joint rehab after injuries, and for muscle spasms, so I am very familiar with its use.  </li>
      <li>It would be nice to see an excerpt of the original infomercial and more Before &amp; After pictures</li>
      <li>Having never been one for conflict, I must say that this mask is the perfect solution to ending long term conflicts with those you</li>
      <li>It has been my most important Beauty ritual along with Retin-A and Sunblock.</li>
      <li>The straps fit nicely and my breathe holes are adequate.</li>
      <li>I wish the products were more accessible.</li>
      <li>If you have medical issues, it would be worthwhile to ask your doctor if any great harm might be done by trying electro-stimulation [or TeNZ-type] device.   </li>
      <li>recommend it for only the more intelligent people, so they don&#x27;t hurt themselves.</li>
      <li>People who did not know me didnt notice any problems, people who knew me said a HUGE difference.  </li>
      <li>Read, watch TV, do light cleaning chores, so you</li>
      <li>Amazon.com had not provided a detailed info about this product.</li>
      <li>, it was that comfortable.</li>
      <li>It will not sit an any head for even contact or comfortably.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s face it, gravity and ageing happens, why not take 15 minutes a few times a week to look your best?  </li>
      <li>However, everyones face is unique and this mask is one size.  </li>
      <li>original in the box.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The familiar feeling of dread returned to me, and as I brought it up to my face, the mask lurched forward and clamped itself to my face, burning against my skin.</li>
      <li>I purchased my first rejuvenique in a reputable department store in the UK</li>
      <li>I was reminded of the scene in \\&quot;G\\&quot; with eddie murphy, where Morgan Fairchild turns her dermo-toner up to high, which caused me to laugh, which caused more pain!</li>

      <li>This device was successful in doing so, and without blowing power to the whole town like in the old days.  </li>

      <li>, it was pretty easy to use: just put it on and watch</li>

      <li>but I thought \\&quot;hey, it&#x27;s worth a try\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>she&#x27;ll make fun of me, and I&#x27;ll let her borrow my rejuvenique, and rig it to stay at 7.</li>
      <li>It would get in the way of my fun activities at camp.</li>
      <li>I figured it wouldn&#x27;t work and might burn somewhat, like those ems weight-loss belts that got pulled off the market, but ems is used for physical therapy patients who can&#x27;t move muscles well on there own yet, and so it wasn&#x27;t like</li>
      <li>will have to keep your hand on the power adjust button because some parts of your face will be more sensitive than others.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten compliments at work about how nice I look right out of the blue.  </li>
      <li>lets try since 1999, that&#x27;s right 1999.</li>
      <li>I was surprised the tape didn&#x27;t offer more information about the whole line of Rejuvenique products or show a section of the infomercial so that we are reminded why we are subjecting ourselves to this ridiculous-looking device and why it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>If anything, I&#x27;m an artist, and a pretty wierd person, and I knew I could have some fun with it someway, if it worked or not.</li>
      <li>, I bought a different system costing £392.00 which was no where near as good as the Rejuvenique.</li>
      <li>I had only used this product for a few weeks when my best friend looked at me and said \\&quot;What are you doing to your face?</li>
      <li>I gotta admit, I bought this facial toning mask in complete good faith.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Used properly, the mask is safe.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t use this mask unless you want to have a real life texas chainsaw massacre or micheal meyers experience!</li>

      <li>People, this thing is pure quackery.</li>
      <li>i would deal w this dealer again , but the product is to large for my face , I don&#x27;t think it works as the company claims</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A brilliant piece of kit ... Had one 10 years ago and I looked 30 at the age of 40 but I lost it when I moved home and haven&#x27;t had one for 8 years, I bought a different system costing £392.00 which was no where near as good as the Rejuvenique. I have recently purchased one off ebay and after 2 weeks of use I can see the difference already!!! I have tried others way more expensive than the Rejuvenique and was not impressed with the results and they were way to fiddly and time consuming ... I do 30 minutes 4 times a week just before bed ... Not the prettiest piece of kit but who cares!!! It&#x27;s a lot less scary to look at than a bodged face lift.</li>
    <li> this nightmare mask dose&#x27;nt look this way just because!it dose&#x27;nt burn your face for nothing.this is the official mask from hell. i guess it is great for halloween parties etc. but that&#x27;s about it. don&#x27;t use this mask unless you want to have a real life texas chainsaw massacre or micheal meyers experience!</li>
    <li> It does not help &amp; is a piece of garbage. Even if you wanted this for interesting electro sensations, it&#x27;s garbage. Get a tens unit &amp; pads for this type of therapy or kicks, not this \\&quot;hocus pocus\\&quot; trash. The electrodes are not ajustable as it says in the intructions, so if you try to adjust them as per instructions, you&#x27;ll just break it. It&#x27;s very hard rigid plastic with hard metal electorodes sticking out... very uncomfortable. It will not sit an any head for even contact or comfortably. It will leave lots painful dents on your face for a long time. It&#x27;s useless for beauty, therapy, or kicks.</li>
    <li> I try to take 40 minues most days and simply relax with the rejuvenique mask on my face with just enough force to do make me feel the sensation on the pressure points. I see results almost immediately. My face feels firmer. My whole body feels relaxed. Sometimes, If I use the mask at night it puts me to sleep.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying the rejuvenique mask is a joke, dont bother wasting your money, it simply doens&#x27;nt work, when you put the mask on you feel some kind of electric traveling on your face,it is uncomfortable and risky. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I got this product 2 weeks ago. I had very low expectations for it initially but I thought \\&quot;hey, it&#x27;s worth a try\\&quot;. So i pulled that bad boy out of it&#x27;s box and my life has never been the same. I immediately began to use it and I was instantly infused with the awesomeness that is named Micahael Jackson. I had a newfound confidence. I decided to wear it out in public and the results were amazing. Let me tell you, the ladies could not stop looking at me! Their eyes were on me the whole time. It was like nothing ever before, i could see the lust in their eyes. Little kids shrunk from the power they felt within me. The guys could feel something deep within me and automatically went into defending their territory mode. They knew that I was intruding upon their land and would soon rule over the lands and the seas like some type of humanoid king bowser.    Unfortunately, this mask does not increase your fighting skills (I suspect this was because it would outstandingly increase your love-making skills) and unfortunately the guys ganged up on me and beat me up. It&#x27;s okay though; wearing this mask out, I have pride, confidence, bravery.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first rejuvenique in a reputable department store in the UK and I was approx. 53 years of age at the time and was amazed at the results after only a few weeks. My product was damaged in transit and as hard as I tried was unable to replace it. Whilst on holiday in Alaska I decided to try once more and this time I was sucessful.  I am now 63 years of age and once again I have the use of my face mask and if I could afford a face peal I would make Linda Evans look like an old Granny.  My eternal thanks for this product it is brilliant.</li>
    <li> I own 4 different facial toners including this one. This mask facial toner was created in 1999 when the laws were less strict, so it is stronger then the others. As long as you do not over due it, it does the best job hands down. The newer models can not be made as stronger, so they do not work.</li>
    <li> I had only used this product for a few weeks when my best friend looked at me and said \\&quot;What are you doing to your face? You look so good.\\&quot; I told her that the only thing that I had done was to use the Rejuvenique Mask. My husband bought it for me about 10 years ago. When I pluged it in, it worked great and the products still seemed fresh!    Another friend of mine had told me many years ago that when her mother had a stoke, the nurse used an \\&quot;electrical facial machine\\&quot; on her mom and it made her look so much younger. I&#x27;m thinking this device might work based on that same techique. Anyway, I followed the directions and have had no unpleasantness and my face looks and feels better. I wish the products were more accessible.</li>
    <li> The Mask stimulates 12 different muscles in the face for about 20 seconds each and automatically goes through the cycle 4 times for a 15 minute session, then shuts off automatically. It is like a little Nautilus-type workout for your face muscles.    I have had the Rejuvenique (RJV) system for few weeks, but noticed the smile lines fading and the morning puffiness around the eyes diminshing after only (4) 1/2 hour treatments.     The price has come way down and it is now found at a reasonable price at many places. The included VHS tape and booklet are very very basic; just telling you how to connect the cord, adjust the straps, turn it on, and not much more.   I was surprised the tape didn&#x27;t offer more information about the whole line of Rejuvenique products or show a section of the infomercial so that we are reminded why we are subjecting ourselves to this ridiculous-looking device and why it is worth it.  As an ex-[champion]athlete, I have used Electro-Stim (E-S) devices many times for muscle and joint rehab after injuries, and for muscle spasms, so I am very familiar with its use.  The mask is a great easy solution for a face toning workout. I usually reset it and do 2 sessions in a row; however, I find any more than that gives me a headache.    To minimize repetition, I will try to mention some things that other reviewers skim over. Please read the other reviews for the big picture (especially from the ones with several years experience), and notice the people who complained about it used it improperly or didn&#x27;t give it a chance to do its thing.    1. Use it every other day at the most, so you have time to recover (just like any other workout-a muscle is a muscle!). Use it at least 2x/week (every 3 days or so) to maintain maximum results.    2. The gel for the E-S electrodes is bascially el-cheapo K-Y jelly, which many of us already have in the nightstand.     3. As others here have noted, Keep a finger on the knob! For best results, use the stimulation as high&#x27;As Is Reasonably Comfortable&#x27; for each of the 12 areas. I found area &#x27;4&#x27; between the eyebrows to be extremely sensitive, and sometimes (but not always) the areas around the mouth, when the current passes near the roots of the teeth. When it switches to the sensitive areas, I quickly turn it down to around 3 or 4, and then the less sensitive areas get it cranked back up to &#x27;7&#x27; or so (10&#x3D;limit).  5. Used properly, the mask is safe. Some people have mentioned getting &#x27;burned&#x27; by the mask, but I wonder what they did to cause that? I assume they cranked it up all the way (or close to it), hoping for quicker results, and ignored the pain. Helloooo McFly...  6. Too bad Salton does not better support the product on their website. It would be nice to see an excerpt of the original infomercial and more Before &amp; After pictures so one can stay more motivated to use the Product.  7. Try the Rejuvenique beauty products, too.   The moisturizers are pretty good with an excellent list of [largely natural]ingredients, and no added perfumes. (...)The only downside is that NO Expiration Date is shown on the tubes and containers, so I am not sure how fresh some of these discounted products are, nor how much it matters.   8. Medical Issues: Of course, Use caution with ANY E-S device if your body is injured, sick, or stressed in some manner.  If you have medical issues, it would be worthwhile to ask your doctor if any great harm might be done by trying electro-stimulation [or TeNZ-type] device.   --Bottom Line: If it HURTS, don&#x27;t do it!  [duh.]  8. Don&#x27;t plan on going anywhere for about 20 minutes after a treatment.  You will have little red spots from the pressure points for a little while afterwards.    9. Don&#x27;t forget that a facelift costs around $12,000, so this is a really cheap [but effective] alternative! At least it will delay the need for a surgical Lift.     I hope this helps y&#x27;all!</li>
    <li> I gotta admit, I bought this facial toning mask in complete good faith.&lt;br /&gt;I researched the concept as much as I could, and generally felt that it had some credence.&lt;br /&gt;I used it faithfully for a NUMBER OF MONTHS!&lt;br /&gt;Hey, it was pretty easy to use: just put it on and watch TV.&lt;br /&gt;I finally came to the conclusion that not only was it not making me younger looking,&lt;br /&gt;but it was actually making me look older!&lt;br /&gt;A pox on you Linda Evans!&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it and just started doing some common sense facial exercises.&lt;br /&gt;Lookin&#x27; good now.&lt;br /&gt;However, it does have a small worth as one heck of a scary looking Halloween Mask!</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for over 13 years and it finally gave out on me, I just recently ordered a new one and it arrived very quickly, I had a little trouble at first because the battery that came with the product had expired, therefore, it didn&#x27;t work until I replaced it.  It works just great, I use this item three to four times a week and although I am 48 years old people do not believe it so I can say it does exactly what it promises and would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MSK</li>
    <li> The product wasnt for me.</li>
    <li> People, this thing is pure quackery. There is ZERO objective evidence that it works and the manufacturer has been given a warning by the FDA to prove their claims. See: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like so many junk products like it, people think it works because they WANT it to work so badly they can&#x27;t be objective about results.</li>
    <li> Good product but when I came to Amazon to purchase a second one as I&#x27;ve had mine for years and lost it, I couldn&#x27;t believe that it was sixty dollars more than it was last week from this same seller. That seems very odd to me so I will purchase on an online auction site instead because the price is much better.</li>
    <li> My wife got this from a friend for $20, who bought ten of them at $10 to resale. What does that tell you  about the product? It was  waste of $20. Linda Evans should be ashamed. My wife&#x27;s first reaction... \\&quot;DayYAM!!!! that hurts\\&quot; My wife is a liscensed esthetician and tries alot of products and procedures. This was painful, cheaply made product. The gromets on the inside of the mask will scrape your face if you are not careful. Its not a comfortable fit and when you turn it on it feels like ants biting your face. Only a quack fool would believe any of the positive reviews of this product. If it were not potentially a hazardous product it would be a joke.</li>
    <li> My wife started using this a couple of weeks ago just to see what it was all about and she really likes it.  So do I, her skin is looking much prettier and it feels softer to the touch.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find words to describe this, but here are a few from people I know who&#x27;ve tried this: &amp;#34;Please, please, I&#x27;ll tell you the account numbers, just stop.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t KNOW why black helicopters would be following you, I&#x27;m just the paperboy.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;My god, how many people have you done this to? How many corpses are down there? NOOOOO!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good times.</li>
    <li> I bought my Rejuvenique facial toning mask a number of years ago. I discovered early on that if you will use a facial cloth such as Loreal&#x27;s REVITALIFT Mask (i haven&#x27;t tried any other but may have to soon as these are almost impossible to find) anyway put the wet cloth on first and then put on the Rejuvenic Mask now you&#x27;re getting somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;You will have to keep your hand on the power adjust button because some parts of your face will be more sensitive than others. I turn down the intensity when it hits the bridge of my nose but when it is stimulating my forehead, and checks I crank up the intensity as high as I can stand it. Afterwards, my skin is tight, plump and glowing! I always do it before a big night out and I always get lots of compliments. When I am with friends my own age they marvel that I have no wrinkles because we are 49!  This is my beauty secret.  If I could get the Dr. Oz show to feature it then Loreal would have to start making the masks again and lots of them!! Maybe even at a cheaper price!!!  Wouldn&#x27;t that be heaven on earth. Together the Rejuvenique facial toning mask and the Loreal Revialift mask are the dynamic duo!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 43 and have been using the mask for a week. It&#x27;s not totally painless...I do two treatments in a row (30 mins), the metal tabs feel like they are boring into my forehead after 20-25 minutes, so I lift it slightly off the forehead towards the end.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed an improvement in my smile lines, frown lines, and jowls already. I can&#x27;t wait to see what I look like after 3 months! I never thought this would work. What a surprise.</li>
    <li> Mask-O (TM) electric face treatment center is a do it at home kit which slowly dislodges the veins within your skin and makes them agitated, red and inflamed and thus, \\&quot;puffy\\&quot;. Modern medicine has determined that a \\&quot;puffy\\&quot; face not only looks deformed, unnatural and repulsive but there also minimal health benefits involved. If you want to look like a plastic surgery reject then this product is for you. Hook this up at night, and leave it on only until there are enough watts of electricity pumping through the spores in your now numb face. Recommended for people who live in Los Angeles and people who believe that they are eternally young.</li>
    <li> Having never been one for conflict, I must say that this mask is the perfect solution to ending long term conflicts with those you despise.&lt;br /&gt;My neighbor, being what I can safely describe as my nemesis, would without fail find ways to ruin my life. His main method of guerrilla warfare would be to stop outside my house with his dog, and allow his flea ridden mutt to defecate on my grass. I would not mind as much as I do except that this insane evil mastermind must feed his walking sprinkler a mixture of vindaloo, gunpowder and liquid malevolence, as the substance that leaves the hound&#x27;s rear tunnel ejects at such velocity that it once set off several car alarms around the street. Being the uncomfortable, introverted shut in that I am, I had no choice but to accept these life destroying, nerve gas producing bundles sitting on my front garden. It was only until one particularly volatile lump flew from the dog and shattered a pot of begonias that I had tirelessly worked to help grow during the harsh winter, that I decided that something must be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had already come across this product before when searching for ways to iron the stress wrinkles from my forehead and decided to try it out, but once I held it in my hands, the barely unbridled power that lay within terrified me so much that I sealed it back into its box and stored it under my bed. When the moment came for me to retrieve the item, I could feel the floorboards shake, as if the mask was demanding I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The familiar feeling of dread returned to me, and as I brought it up to my face, the mask lurched forward and clamped itself to my face, burning against my skin. I find it hard to recall the next few hours, but when I awoke I felt a power beyond anything I could describe. Prepared to take on my foe, I set the dial to \\&quot;turbulent\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standing at my window, I waited until the fateful time that my rival and his dog approached. It was not long until he looked up and saw me staring back at him. I was unsure if my mask was working at first, but sure enough I began to notice my neighbor&#x27;s lips pushing down past his teeth and into his mouth. They were soon followed by his nose and eyes. His entire face imploded into itself and as his head became nothing more than a speck, a torrent of blood erupted from his stump. The dog, most likely horrified by this event ran off down the road never to be seen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a very useful product, only trouble i have had with it is that it is forever stuck to my face. 9/10ring back at him.

    <li> I was given the Rejuvenique as a \\&quot;Halloween\\&quot; present from one of my best friends. We found it at a thrift shop for 5 bucks. A few years back, we had been witness to the scary and surreal infomercial on late nite cable and found it hilarious. I will most likely use it as a prop at my upcoming Halloween party..but curiosity killed the cat, so I have now used it twice. The Rejuvenique is great if you are into self-electrocution! Do you like risks? Get pleasure from pain? The Rejuvenique is for you! I dig the intensity contol knob..you can play a game of \\&quot;Mercy\\&quot; with your face. It really is a creepy device! Since mine was a used model, the gold plating had rubbed off of a few of the electrodes so when those were activated, they did so with a particularly powerful shock (ow ow ow) It was kinda tricky figuring out when exactly to turn down the intensity knob so that my forehead didn&#x27;t feel like it was in contact with a live power line...Never fear..you can always buy new gold plated electrode thingys from the Rejuvenique company!  &lt;br /&gt;I like the way you have to put toning gell on all the little electrodes or else (according to the instructions) it won&#x27;t work..furthermore you have to buy the stuff from the Rejuvenique company. How convenient for them! I also am amused by the fact that it was invented by some Scientologist quack who according to my recent research has no legit credentials but calls himself a doctor. I am a big fan of any contraption that comes under fire by the FDA due to safety questions. The Rejuvenique is an example of what makes our culture so grand!  &lt;br /&gt;The receipt for my Rejuvenique kit was still in the box. The previous owner had spent 200 bucks for it..and she didn&#x27;t even use up half of her toning gell before shipping it off to the thrifty store! It has been about 20 minutes since my last treatment. I have a slight headache. At the same time, I have the sick urge to go back for more..I think the product&#x27;s image would benefit greatly if someonelike Uncle Fester did the infomercial instead of Linda Evans. Unfortunately, that is no longer possible.</li>
    <li> I will tell you when I put this on around my husband he won&#x27;t look at me and says I look scary BUT I will tell you it WORKS.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It takes down the puffiness of age and smoothes the lines. My cheekbones look great and the feedback I get from friends and family proves it works. Little do they know, I&#x27;ve go my mask making it happen. Let&#x27;s face it, gravity and ageing happens, why not take 15 minutes a few times a week to look your best?  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it. Follow the directions carefully and make sure to clean it properly after each use. Also make sure you are shipped a NEW one not used. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> So I wanted to look my best for my high school reunion at Camp Crystal Lake and I have to say, thank you Rejuvenique. My face hasn&#x27;t looked better in years! The straps fit nicely and my breathe holes are adequate. I don&#x27;t use the telephone cord or that doohickey button thingy. It would get in the way of my fun activities at camp. Although you can see it, I&#x27;m smiling inside.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered the Rejuvenique RapeFear Fantasmask after seeing it advertised on youtube as an efficient means of subjugating fools I feel are beneath me, to the distorted, fragmented and terrifying mental imagery I am able to conjure in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It boasts several different levels of unease, which can be altered by utilizing the dial. Once on, the FantasMask will psychically broadcast your most twisted mental images and thoughts to all those who are in the immediate vicinity. Once the broadcast is complete, you can set your mask&#x27;s dial back to &#x27;reality&#x27; and with any luck, the recipients will be your willing slaves for up to 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used my mask for the 6-7th time I made the terrible mistake of walking infront of a mirror with it still activated. This resulted in a permanent loop of my own twisted thoughts. I passed out and awoke crying blood and proceeded to vomit after returning to my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is an excellent product for those who wish to enslave others via psychic control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I did try using this on my pet dog, but he violently turned inside out and the resulting &#x27;pop&#x27; sent his internal organs and viscera pretty much everywhere.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product based on the info they have on site. Amazon.com had not provided a detailed info about this product. But when you buy it then you discover that if you had any kind of dental treatment you cannot use this product. This product is not worth trying it is really painful to use and the electric ting is very intence also it bruises the face. do not try it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also say that don&#x27;t rely on the info Amazon.com provides about the product as it is inaccurate and incomplete and you can endup losing your money as I did lose mine.</li>
    <li> I received a burn on my face from this product.  I still have a scar from it two years later.  I wouldnt reccomend it to anyone.  I think it&#x27;s dangerous and should be taken off the market.</li>
    <li> The battery died after the second use, perhps because the battery was very old. . .the original in the box.  Will purcase aother one to replace it.</li>
    <li> Dear lord! This looks a product that Doctor Who would show up to stop with the help of his sonic screwdriver.</li>
    <li> This mask works so well, at one time the FDA wanted to make it necessary to have a prescription for this. I&#x27;m 55 years old. Started using it in 2002. I use it at least 5 days a week. If I skip a week or two, the sags start to happen. This keeps my face from sagging. And I sometimes get lazy and skip, but when I do, I go right back to using it, because there is a big difference! As mentioned in the other reviews, do keep you finger on the knob to control the strength of the pulsations, as different areas of the face can take  more than others. This does leave little indent marks after using, so don&#x27;t use it just before going out. I usually use it while reading in bed. It has been my most important Beauty ritual along with Retin-A and Sunblock. If you want something to help with a sagging jaw or face in general. This is it! I always have people look at me in disbelief when I tell them my age. And no it isn&#x27;t just because of the Retin-A and sunblock. As I said, if I stop using it I start to sag, a lot! But as soon as I start again, within 2 weeks, back to tighter skin. Now, I just don&#x27;t get lazy anymore.</li>
    <li> We recently exhumed my Uncle Carl after 19 years, in hopes of bringing him back to life. This device was successful in doing so, and without blowing power to the whole town like in the old days.  Unfortunately, it was unable to also revive Uncle Carl&#x27;s monthly pension, so we reburied him.</li>
    <li> I tried this mask before. As I was using it, I started to feel drowsy. I started to feel &amp;#34;controlled&amp;#34;, as if some demon was possessing me. After 2 minutes, I don&#x27;t know what happened, I woke up in a corn field in my underpants and covered in blood. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used to stress over what costume to wear at Halloween, but now I don&#x27;t have to. With this creepy mask I scared the absolute bejesus out of the neighbourhood kids 3 years ago and they haven&#x27;t been back since. This of course means that I don&#x27;t have to buy candy anymore. I only gave four stars because I glimpsed myself in the mirror and lost control of my bowels.</li>
    <li> When this item arrived I was very excited! I hadn&#x27;t been on a good killing spree since breaking my old mask when I was running down the stairs after leaving my last victim in a pool of blood on her bed.  Imagine my excitement as I ripped the box open ready to go out and satiate my psycho-killer instincts.  This mask provided adequate \\&quot;Scare-factor\\&quot; but left a lot to desire when trying to stab while at the same time holding the control box.  I tried to put it in my pockets (too large) and then tucked it in my belt, but that just activated the mask which made my killer one-liners sound a little lame as I found it hard to speak clearly while wearing the mask.  Final Verdict:  This mask would be fine for any aspiring and yet dully non-creative serial killer who wants to focus on doing the dirty work with a pistol or similar single handed weapon, but if you need both hands for gripping a weapon (chainsaw or axe) or needed two hands for stabbing-related activities, I would pass on this mask in favor of one without a control box.</li>
    <li> The idea of using electro stim to strengthen and tighten facial muscles is sound.  However, everyones face is unique and this mask is one size.  So, good try, but more useful as an instrument of torture, and or to creep out whoever walks into your livingroom while you have it on.</li>
    <li> I have being  looking for a facial muscle stimulator for a long time, found it by accident not ease to find. The mask works well, it is ease to use. Often times people do not follow a routine because of the time factor, this mask can be operated while doing other things. The best part about it it works!!</li>
    <li> I got this mask brand-new from big lots, and whether or not you want a review of big-lots, I&#x27;m gonna give one here too. I got stuck going to big lots with a friend to look for a plunger, which we did not find, but I did realize I have a lot less esteem for Jerry van dyke than I used to. The prices are outrageous for a so-called \\&quot;outlet\\&quot; store, ($5 for two lightbulbs!), but I did find this mask at a reasonable price. What happened? Jerry is peddling liquidated merchandise, and Dobber, (name on Coach), is now sponge bob&#x27;s lover patrick. Anywho, about the mask-I have chronic insomnia (which is hard on my only 20something skin, thus the need for this type of product), and I remember amusing myself in the wee hours by watching this infomercial, which was rich with all the usual hilarious cliches. I remembered the price of the mask being like $300 or something, and at $12.00 big lots, I thought it was a great buy, after all it&#x27;s the infamous rejuvenique! If anything, I&#x27;m an artist, and a pretty wierd person, and I knew I could have some fun with it someway, if it worked or not. I figured it wouldn&#x27;t work and might burn somewhat, like those ems weight-loss belts that got pulled off the market, but ems is used for physical therapy patients who can&#x27;t move muscles well on there own yet, and so it wasn&#x27;t like this was totally frankenstien science. After I got it home I read all the instructions, and gave it a try. The mask didn&#x27;t fit my face well, and the contacts did dimple my face a bit, (went away after a few minutes), and I had to hold it in place, wich was not \\&quot;relaxing\\&quot;, nor rejuvenating. The gel was really hard to apply to the contacts in any exacting manner, but I managed to get an appropriate amount of gel onto the contacts. I put the mask on, positioned it like instructed, and turned the unit on. The instructions say to start at 3, but I did at 2, just to be safe. I ended up going past 4 on my lips down, but I didn&#x27;t turn it down in time before it passed my brows again, and it hurt quite a bit! I was reminded of the scene in \\&quot;G\\&quot; with eddie murphy, where Morgan Fairchild turns her dermo-toner up to high, which caused me to laugh, which caused more pain! I thought for sure I&#x27;d have visible burns, but no such luck. By the time I got half-way through my treatment (the machine passes twice down one side of face then the other), my cat was seriously spooked by the mask, and was howling and trying to get me to take it off, so I did. OMG! I couldn&#x27;t believe it, the left side of my face was actually firmer to the touch. the dark circles and puffiness around my eye was almost gone, and you could really see a difference in my skin tone, and the structure of my face! My left eye looked open, and my brow wasn&#x27;t furrowed, my laugh lines were nearly gone, it was like a mini-face lift or botox! The only problem is, I didn&#x27;t do the other side, darn cat! The system works for me, but now the right side of my face is droopy, it&#x27;s hard to focus my eyes, because one is open and the other is droopy, and my pupils are confused as what size to maintain. I guess I&#x27;ll use it again tommorrow, and leave it off my face for the first half of the treatment. Hopefully that will work, my Aunts coming to visit tuesday, and as of right now, I look like a stroke victim. Oh well, maybe she&#x27;ll feel sorry for me and pay for my photography classes, either that or she&#x27;ll make fun of me, and I&#x27;ll let her borrow my rejuvenique, and rig it to stay at 7. ;/in, and it hurt quite a bit!

    <li> I bought this product and just after 2 sessions I could see results....I think this is a great product if you use as directed!</li>
    <li> I bought this product in 1999 but started using it only last year when I thought I needed to use it! To my surprise I saw the difference after my first use itself and with 2nd, 3rd and more regular use I started looking 24 again! No one believed that I was 1972 born!  I preferred using it just before sleep at night.  The only complain I have with this mask is, that the mask does not fit me properly (my face is small!) and for that reason I have to adjust it all the time to get sensation everywhere. That&#x27;s one flaw besides putting that pea sized gel on each electrode! But hey, if it makes you look so much younger what is the big deal in doing all that!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since the year 2000. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am 52 and people say I look 40.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The facial mask exercises the muscles, and not only lifts the facial muscles but brings a healthy radiance to the skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Note:  I use the facial mask every other day, for 30 minutes. (2 pre-programmed sessions). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this mask is that you can do other things while getting a facial.  Read, watch TV, do light cleaning chores, so you *don&#x27;t* feel your time is \\&quot;wasted\\&quot;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this facial mask to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to get a plastic surgery face lift.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
    <li> The only thing that keeps this from working is if you don&#x27;t do it. I have used the hand held models for years and they are easier to use, but this one really does make a difference in the way my face looks when I use it.</li>
    <li> I am 41 years old and I don&#x27;t look my age but felt my skin start to sag a little and I don&#x27;t like botox or using anything similar to it so I thought I&#x27;d try the rejuvenique mask kit and it is absolutely FABULOUS! I feel it working.  I usually use it at night because it will leave the red spots on your face because I use it on high and by the next morning, it&#x27;s all gone. My skin feels refreshed and I feel like I received a facial. It&#x27;s awesome, so worth the money. My suggestion is use it at night at least 3 times a week and you&#x27;ll see and feel a difference. I did not get paid for this review. I just wanted to share my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up comment:&lt;br /&gt;Today is 12/2/2013 and It&#x27;s now 1 1/2 years later from the date that I purchased and started to use the mask and about three months ago my machine stopped working :(  Not sure where to send it to get fixed. So bummed. Just beware.</li>
    <li> . . . you will use this product.  I am in the old, abandoned house.  I put the Mask on myself.  I become the Mask.  I am the Mask.  An unstoppable killing machine, with no mind but for murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stalk my neighbors.  They run but they cannot hide.  I bring them back to the house, I put them in the basement.  I tie them to the chair and put the Mask on them.  They open their eyes behind the Mask and see me, without my face.  They scream.  They feel the electric needles of the Mask.  They scream even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:1588467449 WoD Slasher (World of Darkness (White Wolf Hardcover))]]</li>
    <li> SERIOUSLY?  I received what the company calls a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; one and received it on 12/18/13.  When the box was opened I could ACTUALLY SMELL the old cardboard smell from something that has been stored for a very long time, and I mean very long. People...  lets try since 1999, that&#x27;s right 1999. THAT IS NOT NEW, ...  IT IS AN ANTIQUE. Everything was faded yellow with time. The contacts on the face mask have all oxidized and in very bad condition. I can admit that when I read the product description and it said VIDEO TAPE, I should have &amp;#34;stopped the presses&amp;#34; there, not realizing it was an actual VHS from 1999 starring Linda Evans. How many of you still have VHS. Gee, I wonder if I should register my 15 year old face scam, I mean mask.........  AMAZON...you can do better than this....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 43....and nobody believe it.</li>
    <li> I have read a few reviews where people got the item used and found it undesirable. I got mine new, with instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to use the toning gel (or k-y) to avoid over stimulation. And never turn it up to where it hurts/pinches. When you get it used you don&#x27;t have instructions and can hurt yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fallen asleep with mine on, it was that comfortable. It stimulates the muscles just like they did to me in physical therapy, on my back. That&#x27;s called a tens unit (Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to use this product, make sure you are doing it correctly. Many things done the wrong way, can have negative results. This product is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for only the more intelligent people, so they don&#x27;t hurt themselves.</li>
    <li> It is okay..it zaps your face , but I have seen no results . I would of giving it 1 star but the shipper was so fast..i would deal w this dealer again , but the product is to large for my face , I don&#x27;t think it works as the company claims</li>
    <li> The mask has a broken prong will injured my own face.  Not a good product.  I came broken and cannot be returned bad business</li>
    <li> When grandma came over to visit, our kids were having a facial revitalizing toning session.  Grandma was rushed to emergency for heart arrhythmia after she walked in the door.  I am afraid this product is just too scary for use outside the privacy of your panic room or basement.</li>
    <li> it wont start, and the mask it self felt like nails on my face.</li>
    <li> I am 51 years old.  I started using my mask about 3 months ago and the results are noticeable already.  I&#x27;ve gotten compliments at work about how nice I look right out of the blue.  I know it&#x27;s because of this product.  Also my skin feels so good after I use it.  It seems to &amp;quot;liven&amp;quot; up my skin.  I love it!</li>
    <li> If you want firmer facial features, a more chisled look, then this is the best product you could ever purchase.&lt;BR&gt;You simply put it on and watch tv or read a magazine and it does all the work!&lt;BR&gt;I am a mens fashion model for a top designer and looking great is my career, so when i say this product works, it works!</li>
    <li> The service from Amazon was great. The vender delivered the item well packaged and in a timely manner. I would not hesitate to order from either again. I had looked for this item for some time.    Thank you for your help    KAY BELLMAN</li>
    <li> I do not like this mask is very heavy and thick and does not do the job they say it does.i would not recommend it to any body.I am an aesthetician for 30 year and i know and use everything there is up there but this one I gave it the benefit of the doubt and is horrible.</li>
    <li> I had brain surgery for a non cancerous tumor.  After, the right side of my face slacked, I slurred my words and my face was numb.  My doctors prescribed PT, the gal had me doing facial exercises and rubbing my face with my hands.  It just seemed inefficient.  I bought this and used it every night before bed.  Because I didn&#x27;t want my young children to see it on me--it is a bit creepy.  It was so relaxing I fell asleep with it on.  I never went on with my doctor prescribed physical therapy.  After 3 months the doctors were very happy with the progress and surprised.  People who did not know me didnt notice any problems, people who knew me said a HUGE difference.  Because it was relaxing and I had aleady gotten into the habit of using it, I keep using it for years.  But I&#x27;d only use it when my husband worked at night which is 4 nights a week.  Ten years later I was still using it, as I said, it was relaxing.  It finally gave out, I just bought a new one.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it.  I&#x27;m 52 and my skin is beautiful, people NEVER EVER believe I am 52.</li>
    <li> I have successfully scared the life out of so many people with this. All I do is walk around my house with it on, and all the little kiddies next door freak out and run away, shouting that there&#x27;s a phantom in my house. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I love this mask kit!!! Looks odd however it does the trick &amp; helps with my chronic headaches distracting me with the muscle twinges. Arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s waste of money.  I hate the Facial Toning Mask very much, please do not waste your money to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> It stopped working after 2-3 times I used it. Piee of junk. Don&#x60;t waste your money.</li>
