<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product because it really does the job.  I have had so many problems in the past with my eyelids and this product really cleanses and keeps bacteria away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and also Alcon&#x27;s Systane Ultra drops.</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning eyelids.</li>
    <li> Worked great to prevent eye stye</li>
    <li> Very good for cleaning eyelids and lashes. Recommended by my MD.</li>
    <li> Systane Lid wipes are superior to other brands I have tried because they stay totally moist and actually make a lather when you scrub your eyelids.  It cleanses and soothes your eyelids.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Works well to clean the eyelids and does not irritate the eye. While I don&#x27;t use it for this purpose, The wife seems to like it for make-up removal.</li>
    <li> Very gentle to your eyes! Cleans well too.</li>
    <li> I have dry eye syndrome. This takes off all my makeup. I use it daily. I cant use regular makeup remover only this.</li>
    <li> Too much liquid on pad and will sting if gets in eye.  Have to use with care to get required results without sting.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the overpriced brand name wipes</li>
    <li> My ophthalmologist recommended I use the  Systane Lid wipes since I had recurring styes.  I used them twice a day and they helped to get rid of them.  The soap that is used does not bother your eyes if you should get some in the eye.</li>
    <li> My eye doctor gave me a sample to use to clean my eyes prior to doing some testing.  I liked the way it worked so well that I ended up going on-line and purchasing a box to have at home.  I use them every night to remove my eye make-up and mascara and they work very, very well.  I plan to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> A friend that works in an Optometrists office recommended these for gentle removal of mascara and eyeliner. They are amazing, very soft, right ratio of cloth to moisture. No stingy feeling even if I open my eyes while fully lathered. Pleasant scent too. I have very sensitive eyes that are always itchy. These cloths get the job done without irritating my eyes or surrounding skin. Even takes off Bare Minerals eyeliner, not an easy task. So much better than competing Ocu Soft wipes, &amp;#60;---they are dryer, smaller &amp; scratchy. Systane is slightly more expensive, but worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I use eyedrops that leave an opaque deposit in the inner corner of my eyes.  These wipes remove the deposit and clean my eyelashes as well without being irritating.</li>
    <li> I had trouble with my eye lids being cakey and irritated with dry skin like stuff affecting them.  I tried Neutrogena and Almay.  Neither helped.  I use Systane drops.  l started putting drops on my finger and treating my lids.  It seemed to help.  Then, by chance, I found Systane Lid Wipes in a store.  I bought them and started using them.  By the end of the box, my eyelids were practically cleared up.  I went back to get more and I could not find them anywhere, even in the store I originally bought them,  I LOVE them, so I ordered online.  Thank you..Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> My optometrist told me to start using these when I told her I kept getting styes. I already was using expensive eye makeup remover (Lancome Bi-Facil and Bioderma). However, I tried these anyway because she gave me free samples. After the free samples were out, I bought a few boxes to stock up. They&#x27;re great! I actually have more eyelashes now, since I started using Systane Lid Wipes.</li>
    <li> Systane Lid Wipes were recommended by my Doctor to clean the build up of eye discharge and they really work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is good, and is very good deal.</li>
    <li> Best Wipes in the market!!</li>
    <li> These wipes are nice and foamy and do not burn the eyes.  I was diagnosed with Blepharitis and the Opthamologist said to use these morning &amp; night, along with a prescription antibiotic ointment.  Maintenance was suggested of twice a week forever.  Quite happy with these--easy to use, followed by a rinse.</li>
    <li> These lid wipes come in a packet like hand cleaners at a restaurant, each wipe is individually packaged so you can keep one in our pocket or purse.  The pads are very well lubricated, perhaps too much so, it&#x27;s easy to get some of the lubricant on your clothes when using the wipe.  It appears that they are mainly for removing make up because the pads are fairly slippery.  If you want to remove buildup of &amp;#34;crude&amp;#34; around your eyelids they may not be rough enough to get the job done.  For that I use 2&amp;#34;X2&amp;#34; gauze pads dipped in hot water, that works well for me.</li>
    <li> Needed something for my eyes that was safe and found them here. Cloths are small, however and the cleanser drips from them.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my great-aunt who had previously been buying them for quite a bit more at a local drug store. It arrived promptly and I avoided a trip to the store.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product.  My husband was told about this item from his doctor.  Lid wipes cleanses his eyes .  Thank you</li>
    <li> I just tried Systane lid wipes and broke out immediately in hives, red irritated and lumpy skin from the product. My eye area burns now for 1 1/2 days. I used to use occusoft wipes without any problems. This product has a soapy texture and odor, which I am apparently allergic to.  Beware for people with sensitive skin!!</li>
    <li> I, used one wipe, Wednesday night (06-26-27) and another one Thursday morning.  All day, I, had a burning sensation in my&lt;br /&gt;eyes, and itching around the eyes.  It was very uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> All makeup removers burn and leave a greasy film on my eyelids and do Not remove my long wear gell eyeliners on water line.  I use these to remove the film and eyeliner and it does not burn my eyes or cause any irritation.  They foam up a little and really do a great job at cleaning your lid and water line with no burn.  There is more then enough cleanser on the pad to do each eye. The pads are soft yet have a little texture which helps with cleaning.  I rinse thoroughly after using and have eliminated all eye irritation.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> using this lid wipes had been the only way to stop redness in my eyes!!!! I clean my eyes daily with systane remove make up as well  amazing improved with redness eyes problem. great product! and great seller!!! on time and quick delivery. I will keep buying online, I jumpe from one supermarket or pharmacy to another and it is no easy to find them on stores, this is great one click and I have them at home!!!</li>
    <li> After using, my eyelids feel clean; all of the debris and oil are gone and my eyes feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without these! They keep my eyes fresh and clean, easy to use, takes that mascara and eye shadow swiftly away.</li>
    <li> These wipes are awesome. My eye doctor recommended them and I&#x27;ve been using them ever since. They clean out all dust and grit from the eyes. Safely.</li>
    <li> Clears off makeup easily.</li>
    <li> Excellent for cleansing your eyelids , especially after using eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Super fast service! I really love these wipes because they are clearing up my blepharitis.</li>
    <li> the best and I have tried other brands</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT VERY MUCH AND IT MAKES MY BOTH EYES CLEAN SINCE I USE DRY EYES. I WILL ORDER WHEN IT WILL BE OUT.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my eye doctor for cleaning the eye area...they work really well.</li>
    <li> Never to rub your eyes! You could go blind (when I was young I just rubbed them until I needed glasses). You could put your eye out with that thing. Never put anything in your eye smaller than your elbow.  Good advice, but Mamma didn&#x27;t know about Systane Eyelid Cleansing Wipes. (Nobody else did either, 60 years ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Itchy, oily, gunky eyelids? What have you been looking at?  Well, fret no more, help is here. Rub this little envelope between your fingers and when you tear it open you&#x27;ll find a dainty towelette all saturated with rich lather. Discard the envelope and rub your eyes all you want to with the towelette, but not so much that you begin to enjoy it. Rinse and repeat. Contains a mild no-sting cleaner (dare I say soap?) Nay, varlet! It is a magical soothing balm for tired eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat dry and revel in the silky smoothness of your freshly-cleaned eyes and lids. If your eyes are dry like mine, this complements Systane artificial tears for fast relief...  Well recommended.  Buy some today.</li>
    <li> I resisted buying these wipes when my eye doctor suggested them for the treatment of blepharitis. I have a pantry full of products that I&#x27;ve never fully used, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend money on even more products. But I found the alternative -- mixing baby shampoo and water -- was just too cumbersome and required buying something to use as wipes, so I wasn&#x27;t regular about it. These pads work great. In fact, they&#x27;re so soapy and large that I cut them into six smaller rectangles and use one a night and store the others in the package. So, this box of 30 wipes will last for half a year... not a bad investment for preventing bigger problems with my eyesight.</li>
    <li> Very gentle to your  eyes! love it!</li>
    <li> My eye doctor recommended these to clean my eye&#x27;s every morning. Does a way better job than water and really soothes my eye&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I think this product is awesome; the eyelids feel phenomenal after properly following the easy directions. It is easy and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;The eye wipes produce much better results than soap and when cleansing the eye lids.</li>
    <li> Good for keeping the inside of my eye lids clean.</li>
    <li> Good &amp; got the job done when I had an eye lid infection.</li>
    <li> Love these eyelid wipes for my dry eyes and blepharitis. Other products I&#x27;ve tried are not as moist and are drying and irritating to use. Hard to find these at stores ( sometimes Walgreens) but I&#x27;ll continue to buy these as long as they are made.</li>
    <li> I actually like these better than the Ocusoft brand. They really do produce a good lather. One wipe allows me to remove my eye makeup (which is not heavy) and completely clean my eyelids. The Ocusoft ones never did lather up at all. These are also much cheaper. Win-win!</li>
    <li> These are great for trips. So handy and much easier than the baby shampoo routine.</li>
    <li> These are awesome for removing makeup but I bought them when I had a really bad allergic reaction. They are sterile and dont have anything in them that hurt/burn your eye lid and eye area. I use them now for makeup but when I had the allergic reaction they were perfect for my super sensitive and broken skin.</li>
    <li> When I want to remove my mascara in a hurry, I just grab one of these little packets, squeeze it several times to activate, and then rip it open and swipe over my eyelashes about 7-10 times.....VOILA!  Mascara Gone.  Eyes clean.  You rinse with water after you swipe your eyes and just like that your eyes are fresh and clean.  Perfect to take with you in your purse, just toss a couple packets in and you are good to go.  Love these!</li>
    <li> The wipe were recommended by my eye doctor.  I could not find them anywhere except Amazon.  Tehy are expensive but really work and do not bother my eyes.</li>
    <li> My eye MD recommended these and I was skeptical that they would really help. However, they really do help. If you wear eye makeup I still think it works best to take that off first and then use these.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my husband who says they are very soothing to gently cleanse his eyelids.  I bought them after reading some of the other reviews.  I&#x27;ve used Systane drops for years, and really like them, so was sure these wipes would work well too.</li>
    <li> I have blepharitis and thought that these wipes might help it, based on the reviews.  But, I also wear makeup, and remove it with Neutrogena eye makeup remover, which I&#x27;ve been using for years and doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I tried these after that, and it foams up and leaves my eyes really irritated.  So, one day I didn&#x27;t use my regular routine and tried to take off my makeup with these, and again it didn&#x27;t work and irritated my eyes.  I tried them one last time in the morning and still didn&#x27;t like them.  My eyes feel sticky after using them, not clean.  For me, it&#x27;s irritating.  I&#x27;d return them, but after using 3, I can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The best i can find and helps cleaning eye brows where lots of dust, dirt and other contaminants that land on brows then fall into my eyes as irritating and feel eye tiredness.  the moments i wipe off those as recommended by eye MD, does help to clean and make my eyes feeling better.  It is also good for long road trips after being in front of sun glare or long sun exposure or on very windy days, have the wipes on you anywhere u go and ensure several wipes are on the go for the day.....</li>
    <li> These wipes are recommended to me by my ophthalmologist, and this is the second purchase.  I like them with one exception (that&#x27;s why I gave four stars), you have to rinse your eyes following use.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product for removing eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I love theses wipe. My eye doctor put me on to these. Hey, if the doctor recommended, it must be good.</li>
    <li> Foaming action really cleans eyelids well.</li>
    <li> Removes mascara and eye liner with no oil residue.</li>
    <li> They were for my wife Patti and she says they were great.</li>
    <li> Worked great would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I rotate through many eyelid cleansers, and all of them have their own advantages. To me, what&#x27;s unique about Systane wipes is the lather they produce. So they&#x27;re especially good at removing eye makeup. I can&#x27;t always find Systane wipes in stores, so I&#x27;m glad I can purchase them through Amazon.</li>
    <li> The only eyelid scrub that really works.  I need to order more as there is no store in Bozeman that carriesit.</li>
    <li> Great for cleansing eyelids if you have blepharitis.  These wipes are generously sized &amp; infused with plenty of cleanser.  The best wipes out there even if you have to order them online (can&#x27;t find in stores).</li>
    <li> These are great for removing makeup.  Does not irritate my eyes and that is a plus.</li>
