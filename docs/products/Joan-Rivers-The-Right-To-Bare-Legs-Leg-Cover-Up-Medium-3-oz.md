      <li>Excellent service............</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really Good!</li>
      <li>The great thing is the price.  </li>
      <li>They were great when one didn&#x27;t have age spots but age spots just got darker with them.  </li>
      <li>I am fair so am</li>
      <li>With that said, this body makeup is still a nice cover-up that helps minimize the spots and veins.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, it works exactly as described, the medium color was perfect!  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to go barelegged without this product.</li>
      <li>Be sure to moisturize your legs &amp; wait some time for the moisturizer to penetrate before applying the product.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t as good as the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>it did not cover that good plus, it looks like i painted my legs.. unless you&#x27;re under a certain light...</li>
      <li>Enjoy, I hope you like it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Purchased this Product in Light and</li>
      <li>I was offered a free vein removal by friend doctor but refused as I have age spots all over my legs and would need to cover them anyway</li>
      <li>always be available....</li>
      <li>I keep it on for almost a full week until I need to shave.  </li>
      <li>Of course, be sure to choose the right color --- start with lighter first.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the wait and small sacrifice for a full week of happy legs.</li>
      <li>have sensitive skin and so far so good.</li>
      <li>Lots of hot sun....</li>
      <li>I used it today for the first time while at a business conference in San Diego.  </li>
      <li>the best cover up that I have ever bought: does not easily come off with normal daily activities.</li>
      <li>Two  hours isn&#x27;t really sufficient.  </li>
      <li>are having much Sun, now that summer&lt;</li>
      <li>, It really doesn&#x27;t cover up the way it says it does.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like it to much</li>
      <li>I thought it really did what it said it would do, you need to put on a bundle for it to really work, so</li>
      <li>The only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; is the sponge applicator at the top of the tube, it clogs and dries up, so I simply do not use it, squeeze what  you need from the tube directly.</li>
      <li>My friends are amazed when I tell them that I have make up on my legs as it looks so natural.  </li>
      <li>It took a lot of the product to blend and look fairly natural</li>
      <li>Last a long time and well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>Much thicker than I expected.  </li>

    <li> Terrible product never recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Does not rub off on anything! It&#x27;s really Good!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product.  Did not cover up my battle scars as I had hoped.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Orangey... applicator broke almost immediately.</li>
    <li> Much thicker than I expected.  I used it today for the first time while at a business conference in San Diego.  It took a lot of the product to blend and look fairly natural but then it felt really heavy and did not look natural on my knees, behind knees or on feet.  Very difficult to get off your hands and arms if you get it on yourself during application.  I&#x27;ve used other products but bought this one because it was travel size.  Went to the hotel gift shop and bought sheer black pantyhose for tomorrow because I don&#x27;t like the look or feel of this heavy leg makeup.  Likely will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as good as the first time I used it.Got med as always but not the same.</li>
    <li> Yuk, looks horrible, do not buy.</li>
    <li> i like it.  it stays on in the pool and covers my spider veins.</li>
    <li> Excellent service............</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, non smearing cover for legs, arms, face, where ever.  Not too fond of the container but this is the best product I have found. It covers bruises, scars, veins.  Last a long time and well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t expect a miracle that a product will hide the brown age spots and veins like I have.  With that said, this body makeup is still a nice cover-up that helps minimize the spots and veins.  I&#x27;m wearing it on my arms as well and when I go outside in the sun, it doesn&#x27;t look fake to me.  I&#x27;m also not experiencing the streaking you get with a tanner - no streaks and blends into your skin well.</li>
    <li> the best cover up that I have ever bought: does not easily come off with normal daily activities. The only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; is the sponge applicator at the top of the tube, it clogs and dries up, so I simply do not use it, squeeze what  you need from the tube directly.</li>
    <li> Purchased this Product in Light and Medium.&lt;br /&gt;We are having much Sun, now that summer&lt;br /&gt;is here....Lots of hot sun....I will work with a&lt;br /&gt;natural tan from the sun...I am fair so am&lt;br /&gt;careful in the sun....This product stays&lt;br /&gt;put.  I use it everywhere as needed, LOL.&lt;br /&gt;Even use it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered much because I was fearful, it may&lt;br /&gt;not always be available....Enjoy, I hope you like it.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and so far so good.</li>
    <li> I have had this poduct before, it works well but it doescome off on your clothers,I hate that part.</li>
    <li> Use this every day on my legs in the summer. It works great!!</li>
    <li> Difficult to put on smoothly</li>
    <li> I thought it really did what it said it would do, you need to put on a bundle for it to really work, so I don&#x27;t like it to much, It really doesn&#x27;t cover up the way it says it does.</li>
    <li> It covered some, however like the other reviews stated.. it takes forever to come out of the tube. when i put it on my legs it felt sticky and heavy.. it did not cover that good plus, it looks like i painted my legs.. unless you&#x27;re under a certain light... would not order again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it works exactly as described, the medium color was perfect!  Thank you for the excellent service!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to go barelegged without this product. Bless her sole, Joan Rivers, has come to the rescue of women whose legs have begun to show signs of age.  [brown spots, veins, discolorations, etc]  My friends are amazed when I tell them that I have make up on my legs as it looks so natural.  Of course, be sure to choose the right color --- start with lighter first.  The great thing is the price.  You can afford to buy two shades..  Be sure to moisturize your legs &amp; wait some time for the moisturizer to penetrate before applying the product. It will only wash away if you use soap on the legs when you shower.  I keep it on for almost a full week until I need to shave.  I was offered a free vein removal by friend doctor but refused as I have age spots all over my legs and would need to cover them anyway so why go through discomfort of vein removal? Remember the no-sun tanning lotions?  They were great when one didn&#x27;t have age spots but age spots just got darker with them.  Do give the product time to dry thoroughly before putting on trousers or socks.  I wear loose dress for almost half a day as the product dries. Two  hours isn&#x27;t really sufficient.  It&#x27;s worth the wait and small sacrifice for a full week of happy legs.</li>
