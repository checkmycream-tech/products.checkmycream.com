    <li> um it&#x27;s a toothbrush head - it brushes my teeth</li>
    <li> Just right for my teeth, and will certainly last for the three months, the recommended time to replace the brush.</li>
    <li> Works great on the older Powerup toothbrush, I was concerned because I could not locate a brush for my exact model of the powerup toothbrush. Mine is several years old. These work universally on the powerup battery powered toothbrushes with the same Grey circle on the bottom of the head. I am very happy that I didn&#x27;t need to buy a whole new toothbrush, for that would be a waste.</li>
    <li> No real power, doesn&#x27;t do any where close to a good job. Very cheaply made. Save your money and look for something better and you will be happier.</li>
    <li> I have used the Phillips Sonicare  Powerup  Brushes along with the battery-powered toothbrush for about a year. The brushes are small enough and powerful enough ( by the toothbrush) to remove food particles and plaque from the back teeth. Dental checkups have improved. I have found that an  &amp;#34;Anti-Plaque Dental Rinse&#x27; has improved the cleaning of the teeth while using the brush heads. These are replacement brushes. The Powerup Brushes usually last for 4-5 weeks for me before I need to replace them.</li>
    <li> Great price for refills for my power up tooth brush!</li>
    <li> Best deal I could find. Product was as advertised. Would use again. Retail stores all charged much more for the same  exact product.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. 3 new brush heads in unopened package. Fit my Philips Powerup electric toothbrush perfectly. Will order again.</li>
    <li> like this toothbrush. Does a good job but not does not break the budget. You do need to change the brush heads on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Awesome toothbrush heads. So much cheaper than the traditional sonic care and works just as well. Highly recommend. Try them!</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever owned.  I like that the replacements are just a click away.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price, I like it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Wish I could find a mini brush head to fit this model.</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have ever owned...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally do not endorse hygiene products, but I love my Phillips Sonicare Powerup.

    <li> Perfect fit, awesome price and excellent customer service.  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this toothbrush!  I had a more expensive Sonicare toothbrush before this one, and loved it until it suddenly died after a couple years.  I chose this product, this time around, because all I need to do is replace the batteries when they stop working.  The toothbrush does a great job of cleaning teeth, every bit as good as the more expensive one I had before.  I do wish it were a little less noisy, and that the batteries lasted more than 3 weeks.  But otherwise, I recommend it to anyone who is on a budget as I am.</li>
    <li> Perfect heads for my power up toothbrush</li>
    <li> Good Value for the price.</li>
    <li> fits my power up brush perfectly and cheaper than in the stores. will purchase again.</li>
    <li> The package arrived open.  As in the brush heads were out of the old-looking package (not the outer package open during transit).</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Good product - the actual power toothbrush is great!  These replacement heads were a great price also.</li>
    <li> It is good ! I need it !</li>
    <li> worst tooth brush ever, vibrates too much it could hurt you. dont buy.</li>
    <li> Saved some money - it was cheaper than Walmart.</li>
    <li> Product arrived within a week and it was exactly as advertised.  Not a tricky purchase but it did go down without any difficulty.  Given the difficulty finding the refills in stores, I would easily buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the toothbrush... and this is the easiest way to get extra brushes.  I have a ton of these battery operated toothbrushes, as well as some very expensive models...  There&#x27;s just no beating this toothbrush....  Feel like you had your teeth cleaned.  Not the least bit wimpy....  Great toothbrush...</li>
    <li> Love my Sonicare battery operated toothbrush.  Didn&#x27;t want the cost of the rechargeable version or the amount of space it takes up.  The brush heads are ideal and priced nicely.</li>
    <li> These brush heads fit the toothbrushes as expected.</li>
    <li> They work well, but if you do the price to benefit comparison, it is very hard to justify this &amp;#34;Rent&amp;#34; on a toothbrush</li>
    <li> Good product.  First time to use a powered tooth brush.</li>
    <li> not much to say, they fit and are good</li>
