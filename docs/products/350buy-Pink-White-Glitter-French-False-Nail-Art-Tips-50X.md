<li> These nails are thin and they break easily even with a Acrylic  </li>
<li> My sweet 16 dress was different shades of pink, I take my nails seriously</li>
<li> and I have normal skinny nail bed waste of money</li>
<li> Also came earlier then expected.</li>
<li> Also they were pretty thin.</li>
<li> These do NOT look pink....</li>
<li> and i needed pink tips to match them.</li>
<li> but with a quick fix they are thin but as long as you put thick acrylic and buff it down</li>
<li> I will purchase these and the other colors.</li>
<li> just applying the nail glue made the tip break, they broke completely in half.</li>
<li> Very unhappy with this cheap product, half never fit my fingers</li>
<li> /&gt;Their is a small hiccup though</li>
<li> Hard to have longer nails working 65 hours a week with hands.</li>
<li> so I had to make the acrylic really thick</li>
<li> very thin</li>
<li> Look nothing like picture...  very thin and faded...  </li>
<li> horrible quality, to long</li>
<li> They weren&#x27;t bad considering the price.</li>
<li> This product was bad!</li>

    <li> Look nothing like picture...  very thin and faded...  unless you like really long.. Most if the white gets cut..  what&#x27;s left looks clear after doing. .</li>
    <li> This product was bad! just applying the nail glue made the tip break, they broke completely in half. Not useable AT ALL</li>
    <li> the tips are better than i expected i love them. they are verry good quality and sturdy the glitter fade into in really nicely</li>
    <li> Very pretty I haven&#x27;t tried them yet but will soon. As soon as I do I will try to update on this. Also came earlier then expected.</li>
    <li> They are so pretty&lt;br /&gt;I got these nails in pretty quick and they look so good&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend getting them&lt;br /&gt;Their is a small hiccup though but with a quick fix they are thin but as long as you put thick acrylic and buff it down they work great already ordered more lol</li>
    <li> The color is great but to see the white you will have to have the nails longer.  Hard to have longer nails working 65 hours a week with hands.</li>
    <li> They are really pretty. They look good on, the only problem I had is that they are thin so I had to make the acrylic really thick so they wouldn&#x27;t bend</li>
    <li> I was displeased with the color comparison in the picture they are brighter and prettier but in real life they are more dull.</li>
    <li> Just like picture. I put these on my daughter she loves am. She wanted short nails so the white barely shows but they are still cute.</li>
    <li> These nails are thin and they break easily even with a Acrylic  and that stuff comes off of the nails</li>
    <li> Beautiful pink and frosty design. Nice C curve. Needed to have more wide nails than narrow nails. I would still probably purchase again. Look forward to more future purchases on Amazon! Thank You.</li>
    <li> Arrived early which is nice, I gave three stars only because some of the nails I received in the package are chipped. You get 50 of them and they are bagged by sizes. Just wished some of the nails were not broken.</li>
    <li> My sweet 16 dress was different shades of pink, I take my nails seriously and i needed pink tips to match them. I brought these to my nail artist and she did them for me. I love them!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love!!!  These are gorgeous! I have them on right now! They are in great conditions as Well as them looking amazing (: plan on buying lots more!(:</li>
    <li> These change color and lose all the sparkle once you apply the acrylic.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with this cheap product, half never fit my fingers and I have normal skinny nail bed waste of money</li>
    <li> They weren&#x27;t bad considering the price. Unless you leave your nails long you don&#x27;t get the full effect of the design. Also they were pretty thin. I took them to my nail tech to have them put on so she was able to make sure they stayed strong.</li>
    <li> I love these nails. I am going to order again. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> horrible quality, to long and it you cut it enough to fit your finger, all you see is white...</li>
    <li> I like these because I don&#x27;t have to spend so much time on these nails. Clear acrylic and then filing. It is easy to do, and the design are really nice once they are on. I will purchase these and the other colors.</li>
    <li> these are soooooooo cute!!! very thin but they are cute(: i looooove the way they fit and how cute they look on. i would buy these again. (:</li>
    <li> These do NOT look pink.... These look red.... very dissatisfied.  And a reallyyy light red. Barly notice color....</li>
    <li> awesome product and i will definitly be back for more, these nails are beautiful. they fit my nails perfect and worked great with my powder and acrylic liquid. i am very pleased!</li>
    <li> The actual color is a lot lighter that what is shown.</li>
