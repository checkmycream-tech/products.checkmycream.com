<li> It&#x27;s not goopy, it doesn&#x27;t yellow like other clear nail polishes, and it works great alone or as a base for color.</li>
<li> I put on a coat of the Nail Optimizer, let it dry, put on the color (only at the chip),</li>
<li> This is the only stuff that really worked for my weak, splitting nails.  </li>
<li> They were peeling, dry with vertical lines.  </li>
<li> All that money I spent on pink &amp; white acrylics --</li>
<li> My nails are fairly thin and the Optimizer really works to strengthen them.</li>
<li> I have the manicurist use Nail Optimizer as the base and top coats.</li>
<li> I searched specifically for the refill and think the selling was a little deceptive.</li>
<li> I understand that the 4 little bottles you sent are 2 oz.  </li>
<li> I would like to refill what I have and get away from all the little bottles.  </li>
<li> The only nail-strengthening treatment that&#x27;s ever worked on my thin, brittle nails.  </li>
<li> the reviewer  who complained about no brush in the bottle - that&#x27;s because you bought the refill bottle.  </li>
<li> but they&#x27;re thick as well.  </li>
<li> After YEARS of dealing with a crack that went down the nail vertically, which was very painful and constantly snagging on everything, I tried Prolana Nail Optimizer on advice of a manicurist.  </li>
<li> If you&#x27;re nails are weak and brittle, try this.  </li>
<li> I recommend it to any friends to have thin, weak nails that won&#x27;t grow.</li>
<li> NO MORE!!</li>
<li> They&#x27;re thin, they split and crack and are generally useless.  </li>
<li> It was a bit expensive</li>
<li> My sister&#x27;s manicurist recommended Prolana Nail Optimizer because I have the worst peeling, splitting and cracking nails.  </li>
<li> I have HORRIBLE nails.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is the best nail protector - my nails have never looked better since I started using this!!!</li>
    <li> I smashed my hand in a car door and did severe damage to the nail bed my ring finger and pinky.  After YEARS of dealing with a crack that went down the nail vertically, which was very painful and constantly snagging on everything, I tried Prolana Nail Optimizer on advice of a manicurist.  This product is like a miracle, I finally have my nails back!  This was the only product to repair the damage.  I went to 2 doctors who told me the nail bed was damaged forever and there was nothing I could do about it, and recommended acrylic or glue on nails, which I didn&#x27;t want.  I tried Nailtique, Nailtek you name it.  I would buy Prolana by the case if I could.  All my nails are strong, clear and healthy.  NOTE:  the reviewer  who complained about no brush in the bottle - that&#x27;s because you bought the refill bottle.  The product also comes in a smaller size with a brush.  Thank you Prolana, please don&#x27;t ever change this product!</li>
    <li> I bit my nails for years, and credit this product for making me finally quit. It gave me the strongest, nicest nails that I still get compliments on. It&#x27;s not goopy, it doesn&#x27;t yellow like other clear nail polishes, and it works great alone or as a base for color. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it lasts a long time and is worth every penny. I recommend it to any friends to have thin, weak nails that won&#x27;t grow. Truly great stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this nail treatment. My nails are fairly thin and the Optimizer really works to strengthen them. I can tell a big difference.</li>
    <li> This product works so well to protect my nail polish that I recommend it to everyone I know. I put one coat on at the beginning and then another a few days later so it lasts all week perfectly!</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing! The only nail-strengthening treatment that&#x27;s ever worked on my thin, brittle nails.  Now they&#x27;re not only growing but they&#x27;re thick as well.  The only negative side effect is I&#x27;ve noticed that it does make my nails a bit yellowish but some bleach or just a french manicure gets rid of that problem :)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years, and I love it. I have very  fragile nails and it helps strengthen them. The price was good, and it was sent  very quickly. Of course, I wish there was no shipping charge, but, oh, well!</li>
    <li> My nails were hopeless. They were peeling, dry with vertical lines.  Never though anything would help. I have been using it for two weeks and I am no longer embarrassed when someone looks at my nails. Highly it.</li>
    <li> My sister&#x27;s manicurist recommended Prolana Nail Optimizer because I have the worst peeling, splitting and cracking nails.  I reluctantly bought the first bottle - having spent so much money on other products, many of the recommended highly on AMAZON.  Nothing worked before this. Nothing.  It took a while, at least three months, but I now have amazing nails.  I get them professionally done every two weeks.  I have the manicurist use Nail Optimizer as the base and top coats. I put on Prolana every day the first week of the manicure.  When I started, I changed the color myself in between.  Now the manicure lasts the two weeks, with my adding coats of Nail Optimizer.  Occasionally, I will get a chip.  I put on a coat of the Nail Optimizer, let it dry, put on the color (only at the chip), then another coat of Nail Optimizer.  My manicure will last the rest of the time.  I am so glad it was recommended to me.  I now buy the refill bottle and refill when empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[ASIN:B000HDP00U Prolana (Olan Laboratories) Nail Optimizer .5 oz]</li>
    <li> This polish came in a bottle without a brush.  How are you supposed to apply it without a brush?  It should be clear in the description that no brush is included.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy.  Good price. This stuff really works. I have been to Doctors for my nail problems and this product is the only thing that&#x27;s works.</li>
    <li> Works very well as long as you continue applying after chipping and overall coverage.  Give it time and you will see stronger, longer nails!</li>
    <li> I have HORRIBLE nails.  They&#x27;re thin, they split and crack and are generally useless.  I bought a bottle of this stuff at a salon near my office that was going out of business.  It was a bit expensive so I had never bought it before, now it was 1/2 price.  Made my nails, grow; made them stronger and more solid.  I actually have nice nails now.  Now I by the 2 oz size, without a brush, and use it to refill my smaller bottle when it runs low.  Its a very cost effective way to go.  If you&#x27;re nails are weak and brittle, try this.  You&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff that really worked for my weak, splitting nails.  For the first time in my life, I have beautiful natural nails.  All that money I spent on pink &amp; white acrylics -- NO MORE!! Be sure to paint it on every day and you too can have great natural nails.  I use the CND Solar Oil about 20 mins after the Nail Optimizer every day too.  Get a Flowery Nail White Pencil, run it under the nail tip and you have beautiful looking natural \\&quot;pink &amp; white\\&quot; nails.</li>
    <li> I have problems with splitting nails and this is a great product to give strength to nails in need of help.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I thought I was purchasing a 2 oz refill bottle.  I understand that the 4 little bottles you sent are 2 oz.  But, I don&#x27;t want/need any more little bottles.  I would like to refill what I have and get away from all the little bottles.  I searched specifically for the refill and think the selling was a little deceptive.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it really work. So if you looking for a nail treatment that work this is the one,,, I promise you it reallywork.</li>
    <li> we ordered the 2 oz refill bottle, but instead got the 4 .5oz bottles, which my wife loved!!! this is the only product that helps my wife&#x27;s soft nails.</li>
    <li> Love the products lots of people have ask about the product I have used the products for years....so for this is the best for my nails</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found to stregnthen weak nails.  If you have problem nails give it a try</li>
