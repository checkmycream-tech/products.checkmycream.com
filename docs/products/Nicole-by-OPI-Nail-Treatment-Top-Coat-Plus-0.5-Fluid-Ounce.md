      <li>This is a very nice top coat.</li>
      <li>Mom and Daughter love the polish! -</li>
      <li>We all love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still better than anything you&#x27;re going to pick up in the grocery store, but stick to the non-Nicole line for top coat.</li>
      <li>The Nicole top coat is.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky about top coats, and this one is great.</li>
      <li>I thought I ordered the OPI nail polish and not this item, so I haven&#x27;t used it yet, having another top coat product.  </li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>I ended up purchasing the Essie Top Coat</li>
      <li>On top of all of that, it chipped very quickly.</li>
      <li>It dried quickly, looks great, and after two coats has the perfect consistently.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and is durable.</li>
      <li>I think it may have something to do with the colored nail polish brand, I&#x27;m used to using the cheap ones.</li>
      <li>This goes on smooth.  </li>
      <li>like it that it&#x27;s foramaldye free</li>
      <li>It is important to me that this is a cruelty free product, not tested on animals.  </li>
      <li>Although I love China Glaze (its my fave brand of nail polish), this is by far my favorite top coat.  </li>
      <li>However, as soon as I opened the bottle and used the top coat it didn&#x27;t seem quite right.</li>
      <li>- Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on quite as easily, and it also doesn&#x27;t seem to be setting as quickly.</li>
      <li>I bought out of desperation, stick to OPI original formula, it does nothing to keep your nails from chipping.</li>
      <li>My daughter sneaks into my room regularly and takes this top coat to use on her own nails.</li>
      <li>This topcoat is special.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find my normal top coat in the store</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very slow in drying, but it does leave a beautiful shiny coat on top.</li>
      <li>First, I use OPI brand top coat regularly and I love it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t complain too much since she spends more time wearing makeup than I have in my whole life.</li>
      <li>and i expected more for the price!</li>
      <li>Love to use it on my nails and have for several years.  </li>
      <li>Top Coat Plus, 0.5 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
      <li>In other words, from the grand ole heights of 67.5, I am one know-it-all who can be trusted!  </li>
      <li>I now normally use Seche Vite, which dries in minutes and is super shiny.</li>
      <li>I used this on top of 2 layers of OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;From Ears to Tail\\&quot; and the other reviews were right--</li>
      <li>I let my nails dry for over two hours before going to bed, and wake up with sheet prints smashed into the top coat.  </li>
      <li>It is gooey for hours, and dents easily even the following day.  </li>
      <li>I did like how it cam in super early.</li>
      <li>It helps the manicure last an extremely long time, pretty much until I&#x27;m good and ready to change the polish.</li>
      <li>It gets little bubbles and doesn&#x27;t go on nicely.</li>
      <li>My nail polish stays on so much longer without chipping.</li>
      <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
      <li>honestly it&#x27;s just like using wet N&#x27; wild clear as a top coat.it didn&#x27;t make my polish last any longer</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but Nicole by OPI top coat is different from normal OPI top coat.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try this top coat in place of a standard quick dry top coat (which are thick and sometimes get bubbly).  </li>
      <li>It dries quickly and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>It went on fine, but hours later it still wasn&#x27;t dry.</li>
      <li>The Top Coat by Nicole is a really bad top coat.</li>
      <li>I also have 2 grandaughters who use it frequently.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s longer then when I had my gel mani ( which I got professionally done).</li>
      <li>Either way, long story short, I like this top coat regardless of the 15 minutes it takes to dry and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>My nail polish has chipped 1-2 days earlier than normal the three times that I&#x27;ve used this so far.</li>
      <li>After hours remains soft and loses shine very quickly.  </li>
      <li>The consistancy is a bit different from normal OPI.</li>
      <li>This is surprisingly the worst top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>I never really use top coats so I&#x27;m not sure how WELL they&#x27;re supposed to work.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t upset, I was surprised it only chipped twice while I was doing dishes!</li>
      <li>It was very watery, almost as if it was watered down.</li>

<li> it DID take a long time to wait.</li>
<li> Similar to other reviewers</li>
<li> It has no shine, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to ever completely dry.  </li>
<li> My nails, at least ten of them, have worn paint non-stop since I was 12 years old.  </li>
<li> The OPI color is not new.  </li>
<li> I like Nicole by Opi, as it does not contain some of the harsh chemicals used in other products.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think she would settle for less than OPI.</li>
<li> I used it a few times, and it seems to work</li>
<li> I also find it is very slow to dry.  </li>
<li> This is a terrible top coat.</li>
<li> Another hard to find item, but you had it.</li>
<li> I am disappointed that this Nicole brand is not the same quality as other OPI.  </li>
<li> least a week.</li>
<li> I do my nails at least weekly sometimes twice.  </li>
<li> This stuff is a weak formula.</li>
<li> It is the worse I have tried because it does not protect the nail and gives it no shine at all.</li>
<li> But this polish is very very thin, and hard to spread across the nail.  </li>
<li> When I received it I thought it was too inconvenient to return for the item I wanted.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a bad formula</li>
<li> and I have never been disappointed - I will use again.</li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <li> I like Nicole by Opi, as it does not contain some of the harsh chemicals used in other products. I have been using it for several years and I am quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> I never really use top coats so I&#x27;m not sure how WELL they&#x27;re supposed to work. I used this on top of 2 layers of OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;From Ears to Tail\\&quot; and the other reviews were right-- it DID take a long time to wait. Not several hours like others insinuated but around 15 mins, which is really long for me. Anyway, I had it on for 2-3 days and it didn&#x27;t chip! I was very impressed. It only did when I was doing dishes at the bakery I work at and I had my hands soaked in water and bubbles for a couple hours. I wasn&#x27;t upset, I was surprised it only chipped twice while I was doing dishes! I&#x27;m using it again on OPI&#x27;s Cajun Shrimp. I think it may have something to do with the colored nail polish brand, I&#x27;m used to using the cheap ones. Either way, long story short, I like this top coat regardless of the 15 minutes it takes to dry and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is awesome. It dried quickly, looks great, and after two coats has the perfect consistently. No signs of chipping. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this top coat in place of a standard quick dry top coat (which are thick and sometimes get bubbly).  But this polish is very very thin, and hard to spread across the nail.  I also find it is very slow to dry.  I let my nails dry for over two hours before going to bed, and wake up with sheet prints smashed into the top coat.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Love to use it on my nails and have for several years.  Another hard to find item, but you had it.</li>
    <li> I bought this, got it home and removed the packaging and realized there was no brush in the bottle.  Just how are you supposed to apply it???  I&#x27;m hoping this is a mistake, but when I look at the pic here I don&#x27;t see a brush either. [[ASIN:B001KZ5XDS Nicole by OPI Nail Treatment, Top Coat Plus, 0.5 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> This goes on smooth.  It dries quickly and lasts a long time. I will buy it again. I do my nails at least weekly sometimes twice.  I also have 2 grandaughters who use it frequently.  We all love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but Nicole by OPI top coat is different from normal OPI top coat. I picked it up on Amazon because it was cheaper. The consistancy is a bit different from normal OPI. It doesn&#x27;t go on quite as easily, and it also doesn&#x27;t seem to be setting as quickly. It&#x27;s definitely not quite as durable. My nail polish has chipped 1-2 days earlier than normal the three times that I&#x27;ve used this so far. It&#x27;s still better than anything you&#x27;re going to pick up in the grocery store, but stick to the non-Nicole line for top coat.</li>
    <li> My daughter sneaks into my room regularly and takes this top coat to use on her own nails. I don&#x27;t complain too much since she spends more time wearing makeup than I have in my whole life. This is a very nice top coat. I don&#x27;t think she would settle for less than OPI.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very slow in drying, but it does leave a beautiful shiny coat on top. I did like how it cam in super early.</li>
    <li> This is a very good topcoat but I always follow it with a topcoat of Seche Vite which will help preserve the manicure for&lt;br /&gt;at least a week.</li>
    <li> I purchased in a retail store, not on Amazon.  Similar to other reviewers I am disappointed that this Nicole brand is not the same quality as other OPI.  After hours remains soft and loses shine very quickly.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> First, I use OPI brand top coat regularly and I love it. However, as soon as I opened the bottle and used the top coat it didn&#x27;t seem quite right. It was very watery, almost as if it was watered down. I used it a few times, and it seems to work okay. However, I would not buy it online again.</li>
    <li> This is surprisingly the worst top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  It has no shine, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to ever completely dry.  It is gooey for hours, and dents easily even the following day.  I tried it multiple times using different techniques, but ended up throwing it in the trash.  I now normally use Seche Vite, which dries in minutes and is super shiny.</li>
    <li> The Top Coat by Nicole is a really bad top coat. It is the worse I have tried because it does not protect the nail and gives it no shine at all. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I am delighted with this top coat!  My nails, at least ten of them, have worn paint non-stop since I was 12 years old.  In other words, from the grand ole heights of 67.5, I am one know-it-all who can be trusted!  This topcoat is special.  One coat of it atop 2 coats of OPI color last longer than they used to; they look deeper, too. The OPI color is not new.  The Nicole top coat is.</li>
    <li> I use with a base coat and regular OPI color - their polish is good and I have never been disappointed - I will use again.</li>
    <li> Mom and Daughter love the polish! - Very Smooth Transaction! - Great Seller! - Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a bad formula and i expected more for the price! honestly it&#x27;s just like using wet N&#x27; wild clear as a top coat.it didn&#x27;t make my polish last any longer and it started chipping the very next day.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible top coat. It gets little bubbles and doesn&#x27;t go on nicely. I ended up purchasing the Essie Top Coat</li>
    <li> I thought I ordered the OPI nail polish and not this item, so I haven&#x27;t used it yet, having another top coat product.  When I received it I thought it was too inconvenient to return for the item I wanted.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a weak formula. I bought out of desperation, stick to OPI original formula, it does nothing to keep your nails from chipping. Yuck.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s the point in buying a nail polish if it dosen&#x27;t come with the brush inside the cap? Very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> It is important to me that this is a cruelty free product, not tested on animals.  It goes on easily and is durable.</li>
    <li> like it that it&#x27;s foramaldye free</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about top coats, and this one is great. My nail polish stays on so much longer without chipping.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find my normal top coat in the store so I tried this one. It went on fine, but hours later it still wasn&#x27;t dry. When I looked at my nails in the morning, the polish had bubbled and gotten smudged. On top of all of that, it chipped very quickly.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I had my nails on without any chips for over two weeks! That&#x27;s longer then when I had my gel mani ( which I got professionally done). I got to the point where my nails grew too long so I had to take them off. I&#x27;ve never had anything stay on that long.</li>
    <li> Although I love China Glaze (its my fave brand of nail polish), this is by far my favorite top coat.  It helps the manicure last an extremely long time, pretty much until I&#x27;m good and ready to change the polish.</li>
