      <li>and It feels the best in the wintertime for dry skin.</li>
      <li>As you apply the lightly scented cream, you&#x27;ll find yourself saying &amp;#34;ahhhh&amp;#34;.</li>

      <li>To be honest with you I only use this moisture cream during winter.</li>
      <li>This product is well worth the $38.</li>
      <li>I use this, my skin is deeply moisturized and has a nice glow in the morning.</li>
      <li>In fact, next morning I noticed my skin looked better ~</li>
      <li>Thanks Benefit!</li>
      <li>However when i first use it, i found it is just oily.</li>
      <li>Overall, it is ok.</li>
      <li>Its nice to finally have a great moisturizer for my dry skin- without feeling oily or heavy.</li>
      <li>and I think you will find that would be a really helpful items.</li>
      <li>It really does lock in moisture.  </li>
      <li>and it really brightens the skin.</li>
      <li>it so much</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the fact that I&#x27;m dipping my fingers in it because it spreads germs  - Very pricey</li>
      <li>I have spent countless years and money trying to find a good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it though if you have the extra cash to spend and want something very pure, gentle, and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>The box is cute but the cream seems not worth the price.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
      <li>It smells divine, in short worth every penny.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of brands but nothing, absolutely nothing, compares to Benefit Total Moisture.</li>
      <li>I really recommend this product overall.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin, and this literally makes my face so SOFT.</li>
      <li>I first tried Benefit&#x27;s Total Moisture Facial Cream when I purchased one of those Benefit Kits that has a handful of travel/sample size products.</li>
      <li>Be careful how much you use: once it settles onto your skin and warms up, it gets runny and can run into your eyes.</li>
      <li>it leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft without irritating it,</li>
      <li>I live in a very dry region of the US and this stuff keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day!</li>
      <li>I have dry, flaky skin and have had so much trouble finding a moisturizer that will repair my skin, especially after a day&#x27;s worth of make up has been applied.</li>

    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  WORKS GREAT AND FAST SHIPPING</li>

I&#x27;m just now ordering my second jar, and I&#x27;ve had my first one since August (nearly a year!) LOVELOVELOVE this stuff. Does not clog my pores at all!</li>

Its nice to finally have a great moisturizer for my dry skin- without feeling oily or heavy.This will definately be a staple in my skin care regimen!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this face cream.  It goes on thick and doesn&#x27;t get watery like some other brands.  It really does lock in moisture.  I was breaking out a bit because my skin was really dry.  Once I got a hold of this cream, my face cleared up dramatically and my skin stopped peeling.  This product is well worth the $38.</li>

    <li> I have sensitive skin and have to be careful of the products I use, this moisturizer is wonderful it leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft without irritating it,</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, pale, combination skin that needs a lot of moisture at night. I&#x27;ve been using this for several months off and on. I use it as a night cream as it is quite heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are basic, beneficial, and moisturizing. Nothing really fancy, but not a bunch of cheap wood alcohols either. The fatty acids are very beneficial to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little of this stuff goes a long way. Be careful how much you use: once it settles onto your skin and warms up, it gets runny and can run into your eyes. So use a very, very small amount until you know how it will go, especially around the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this, my skin is deeply moisturized and has a nice glow in the morning. I would repurchase, but the price is out of my skin care budget. It&#x27;s worth it though if you have the extra cash to spend and want something very pure, gentle, and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This cream makes my skin look great.  But it has a very strong fragrance which I find overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;To me it smells like a perfumed laundry detergent.  Too bad, because otherwise it would be my go to moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have spent countless years and money trying to find a good moisturizer. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of brands but nothing, absolutely nothing, compares to Benefit Total Moisture. I have dry, flaky skin and have had so much trouble finding a moisturizer that will repair my skin, especially after a day&#x27;s worth of make up has been applied. When I get out of the shower at night I take a good dose of this moisturizer and slather it over my face and neck. Almost instantly I noticed a difference and after a week&#x27;s use I knew I was never going back. The cost is a bit on the high side, but I figure it&#x27;s worth it to shell out $40 every month or so to keep my skin feeling this great!</li>
