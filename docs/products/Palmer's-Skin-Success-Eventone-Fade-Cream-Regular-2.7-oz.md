### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so I say this is an excellent product</li>
      <li>The scars seen by the burn made me a bit nervous because I am preparing for my wedding and knew that scars on my neck and chest would not be very attractive.</li>
      <li>I really am impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>The best thing about this stuff is that it works, and its not greasy.</li>
      <li>The product is excellent and did match my expectation beyond norms.</li>
      <li>Shes very happy</li>
      <li>I am very fair.  </li>
      <li>Also, the smell isn&#x27;t great.</li>

      <li>Aside from those two downsides, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy to see my brown spots fade away.</li>
      <li>i had used palmers product before and was happy but not to this one.</li>
      <li>However after having experimented with many products and hundreds of dollars, this gives the best bang for the buck.  </li>
      <li>Keep up the good job.</li>
      <li>Even tone body lotion is just as good as the fade cream</li>
      <li>This is a good fade cream</li>
      <li>I would&#x27;ve thought it&#x27;d be almost 49 bucks for how good it is.</li>
      <li>And for a good price.</li>
      <li>Good product if your expectations are according to a $6 jar.</li>
      <li>I loved this product and you can tell I got  10 boxes...which stated would expire 9/15.  </li>
      <li>&amp; I Am Very Satisfied With My Purchase.......</li>
      <li>I Love This Product, It Works Great</li>
      <li>I love this product it worked!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it for two more months!</li>
      <li>and I plan to order more soon!</li>
      <li>You would probably fare better by just applying a good antiaging face cream to your hands for improved skin texture and lightening of age spots.  </li>
      <li>Wearing make up over it and you can still kind of see them.</li>
      <li>though it helped a bit nothing astounding, still I thought I would continue.</li>
      <li>I do have a sort of warm feeling upon application for a bit of time but nothing that is bothersome.</li>
      <li>Works perfect for my 13 year old daughter, She can&#x27;t stand her freckles,</li>
      <li>My skin tolerates the foaming soap better which I&#x27;ll continue using until it finishes.</li>
      <li>it love it</li>
      <li>Wish Amazon would do a subscribe and save with this product :).</li>
      <li>I just wish it had a more lotion texture and could be worn under makeup.</li>
      <li>But I love that I apply this</li>
      <li>If you use it for your face, the result could be better but don&#x27;t know since I have not used it for my face.</li>
      <li>but it dosen&#x27;t do that any more.</li>
      <li>You need to remove the top layer of darker pigmented cells now and then during this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I couldn&#x27;t tell you for sure it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Some areas seem more reactive to the cream than others.</li>
      <li>sure you use it with a sunscreen though.</li>
      <li>I used it more often than directed and a rash came about - my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This combo seems tomake my skin incredible soft and with a glow as well.     </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin but have not myself experienced irritation from this product.</li>
      <li>but my skin is definitely more smooth than before</li>
      <li>I can now apply foundation and cover it easily, where before that was not the case.</li>
      <li>not bad love</li>
      <li>TREMENDOUSLY !</li>
      <li>My routine at night (which is when I primarily use this cream) is this ...</li>
      <li>The plus side is, now that I have medically taken care of the hormone problem, this cream has made a great improvement in the scarring on my face.  </li>
      <li>My skin looks fabulous in the morning and my brown spots are fading.</li>
      <li>Even tried on some light age spots on hands - nothing.</li>
      <li>Skin Success Eventone Fade Cream, Regular - 2.7 oz works great and goes on smooth.  </li>
      <li>Husband has not seen significant results as he had hoped for.</li>
      <li>I looked airbrushed right out of bed and had the bride from that wedding I attended ask me what I was doing!</li>
      <li>Wow this is truly amazing</li>
      <li>I am a strawberry blonde with fair skin.  </li>
      <li>Love  it , it works really welll and almost instantly,i used it on hands</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use the product as much as I should, so I&#x27;m not seeing the results, but it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>The results in just a week were extraordinary.</li>
      <li>.it is exactly what I was looking for and Amazon made it available for me</li>
      <li>I am very careful of using different products on my skin as it is extremely sensitive and temperamental so for me to be able to have this product be so successful was both surprising and exciting.</li>
      <li>I was scared this would burn my skin or make me itch because I suffer from eczema and tend to have sensitive skin but no problems whatsoever! :)</li>
      <li>its great smells like bleach a little bit but</li>
      <li>Been using for a couple weeks now and have not seen much results; however, the cream is smooth and silky and moisturizes well.</li>
      <li>This one is cheap and was highly rated!</li>
      <li>I have always liked the brand and will order the lotion which is smoother next time.  </li>
      <li>With the results I have seen so far, I am confident I will achieve this goal.</li>
      <li>But the price is reasonable, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend, but if you&#x27;re patient then sure buy it.</li>
      <li>and I did use this product on a fresh scar</li>
      <li>It does work, but you have to use it consistently like twice a day (morning and night) to see quick results.</li>
      <li>the skin burn had healed, I used the fade cream right after cleansing my face with the Clarisonic-</li>
      <li>/&gt;I must have gotten the right bottle because I have used it once or twice</li>
      <li>i,have freckles om them and it lightened it right up in like a week</li>
      <li>I stopped using it right away</li>
      <li>It has been one month since I first started using it, twice per day for the first 3 weeks, and once per day for the 4th (most recent/current week), and I am pleasantly surprised by the way it has faded my melasma.</li>
      <li>I could start seeing results within the first month (right cheek &amp; forehead).</li>
      <li>If anything, It might have made them appear more red.  </li>
      <li>It it important to avoid the sun while using this, and to wear sunscreen with physical (not chemical) blocking agents, such as Titanium Dioxide, or the product will not work as effectively, and the discoloration will return.</li>
      <li>it stung for a minute or two the first week</li>
      <li>It does have an SPF, but I use extra to be safe.</li>
      <li>Consult a Doctor/Dermatologist specialist first.</li>
      <li>I have a few good sized brown spots on my face,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I do not know definite if it is as good as it says, I do think it does work some if applied daily.</li>
      <li>I am just saying make sure they are telling you the whole story to ensure you are getting enough information to make an educated decision.     </li>
      <li>but for me it doesn&#x27;t really absorb but spends more time sitting on the surface of my skin leaving white waxy residue.  </li>
      <li>Because this product is fine for maintenance after using the prescription and for improving overall texture of complexion.</li>
      <li>darkness on my elbows are pretty hard to remove, but it makes it look a bit cool, hope to see more progress.</li>
      <li>then when I wake up the next day, I would have huge pimples on my face.</li>
      <li>The cream in the jar is very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Recommends</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin but didn&#x27;t damage it neitheR</li>
      <li>Very upsetting</li>
      <li>this product works really well.......been useing it for about a month and it works.......</li>
      <li>Not irritating, which is a surprise considering the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It really worked for me.</li>
      <li>Any skin brighteners without a horrid waxy, greasy texture cost so much and don&#x27;t have the hydroquinone.  </li>
      <li>I really think if your skin is like leather this is for you.  </li>
      <li>Thanks amazon.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I Received This Product Very Promptly</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used this for about 3 weeks and was just starting to think I could see some dark spots on my hands and arms starting to lighten up.  Then I evidently left the jar behind when staying in a hotel!  Very upsetting but I eventually forgot all about it until I saw it again on Amazon.  I have just ordered another jar and will continue my quest to rid my hands and lower arms of dark spots!</li>
    <li> If I could, I would give this product 10 Stars! I had a severe burn on my neck and chest from a curling iron incident - don&#x27;t ask...The scars seen by the burn made me a bit nervous because I am preparing for my wedding and knew that scars on my neck and chest would not be very attractive. Long story short, I used Neosporin to heal the burn for exactly 5 days. As the burn was healing, the scars were very apparent. I purchased the Palmer&#x27;s Fade Cream from the drugstore and begin using on the 6th day of my burning incident. I begin to notice a change within 3 days. Within a week, my burn scars were almost completely gone...really - barely anything visible.. Warning - You must use this product as directed. I used it more often than directed and a rash came about - my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an african american woman and I did use this product on a fresh scar so I am not sure how effective it will be on an old scar or age spots. I am very careful of using different products on my skin as it is extremely sensitive and temperamental so for me to be able to have this product be so successful was both surprising and exciting. I am now using it on an older scar and it seems to be working but I will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> I looked everywhere in stores for this product, and it was discontinued for some reason? Thanks to amazon for having it. This is the only product that works for my oily face. It keeps dark spots away. I got the products in just two days after placing the order. Thanks amazon. Keep up the good job.</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking it might help fade some slight acne scarring. Nothing. Didn&#x27;t even lighten at all. Had such high hopes and while it moisturized well it didn&#x27;t fade anything at all. Even tried on some light age spots on hands - nothing.</li>
    <li> Wow this is truly amazing I can feel it starting to work already and its only been a few days but my skin is definitely more smooth than before so I say this is an excellent product</li>
    <li> Been using for a couple weeks now and have not seen much results; however, the cream is smooth and silky and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my hands for 4 weeks now and there is no change whatsoever in the appearance of age spots.  If anything, It might have made them appear more red.  I am very fair.  There is no lightening effect at all.  I give it two stars because it does provide moisture to the skin and it does contain Alpha hydrox which should at least exfoliate dead skin cells.  Although I have not seen any brightening of the skin on my hands either.  I will not purchase again and feel that Hydroquinone 2% is not sufficient enough dosage to lighten any areas of hyperpigmentation.  You would probably fare better by just applying a good antiaging face cream to your hands for improved skin texture and lightening of age spots.  I use the same product I use on my face and hands now for overall antiaging effects.</li>
    <li> I like it, but whenever I use it, it gets rid of dark spots on my face, but only temporarly, so 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Love  it , it works really welll and almost instantly,i used it on hands becuase i,have freckles om them and it lightened it right up in like a week its great smells like bleach a little bit but not bad love it love it loveeeeeee it want pics email me for the results alynight@gmail.com</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks now and I can say I do see a difference in my acne scars. You just use it consistently everyday twice a day, to see actual results. I&#x27;ll continue to use it for two more months!</li>
    <li> Too soon for  review.</li>
    <li> Encourage that this little baby gets sold! (Sorry, to those who it didn&#x27;t work out for have you tried Ambi&#x27;s?- i used it back in the day and it didn&#x27;t do too bad? I prefer the ingredients in this brand.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must have gotten the right bottle because I have used it once or twice several months before stopped,because i was unsure about it, than picked it back up after 6 months later and it worked literally within a day or two. I put it on my face. I had tiny burn scars on my skin and it has faded it or given it what it needs to lighten! I also have freckles on my face (in my heritage) and some have disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Extra Tip: You can also:  Exfoliate (the area) than apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> this product works really well.......been useing it for about a month and it works.......my skin is much clearer......i highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have just started using this but I thought I would let you know its on sell at Walgreens.COM for $3.99 for the 2.7oz!</li>
    <li> This is a very thick cream.  I have always liked the brand and will order the lotion which is smoother next time.  However after having experimented with many products and hundreds of dollars, this gives the best bang for the buck.  I use it to fade redness on an old, long recessed scar at my laugh line.  It really did help fade it...didn&#x27;t disappear, but ewhat can one expect for a fifty year old scar?</li>
    <li> I do not know definite if it is as good as it says, I do think it does work some if applied daily. I would buy this again. The cream in the jar is very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Recommends</li>
    <li> used this for two months as they said will see the result.. but not works for me. i had used palmers product before and was happy but not to this one.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that an over-the-counter cream could do anything to help my melasma but I thought I would try it before going to a dermatologist. I was shocked to observe noticeable fading after just one day of use. Some areas seem more reactive to the cream than others. After two weeks none of my dark spots are completely gone yet, but the worst ones are already much, much better. I have sensitive skin but have not myself experienced irritation from this product.</li>
    <li> Actually faded acne scars around my throat area.  I will continue to use it for scars.  Not irritating, which is a surprise considering the fragrance.  The texture is very thick and does not easily blend into skin.  Avoid the eye area.  If you have discoloration, after a few applications, you will see a difference.  It also helped with my breakouts a bit.</li>
    <li> Eh. I used this product along with Panoxyl Acne Foaming Wash 10% Benzoyl Peroxide 5.5 Oz for about a month; I have recently cut this product out of my daily face wash routine and it&#x27;s weird since I&#x27;ve stopped using this product the places I&#x27;ve put the product on my body/face seems to be clearing up, idk maybe its just my skin. But the price is reasonable, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend, but if you&#x27;re patient then sure buy it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the cream, it was very dry on the face and didn&#x27;t work. I stopped using it - waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> Works as it should. I have horrible black spots. Wearing make up over it and you can still kind of see them. I also didn&#x27;t want to look like I was bleaching my skin. But I love that I apply this and it works within hours and you can literally see it working. And if my skin is looking a little pale (Just a little nothing noticeable) I can even my tone out by not using it for a while. All in all, if you have bad scars of any type, this is key. And for a good price. I would&#x27;ve thought it&#x27;d be almost 49 bucks for how good it is.</li>
    <li> This is a good fade cream</li>
    <li> I picked this because I had one in the past but cant find it and the reviews didn&#x27;t seem to bad but not worth the money 1 star.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to work.  I attempted to fade a very small scar and this made no difference.  It could be due to the scar but I think it is just a product that doesn&#x27;t work.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend but I couldn&#x27;t tell you for sure it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my stretch marks (stretch marks are old ones, about 8 yrs old) and on my scars (scars are recent, just a few months). It seems to help lighten the redness. I have noticed enough of a difference that I will continue to use it. It does not take away the stretch marks or scars,it just lightens them and makes them less visible.</li>
    <li> I use it for my black elbows and do not see rapid results yet. Of course my elbows are very hard to whiten because it is a rough skin. If you use it for your face, the result could be better but don&#x27;t know since I have not used it for my face.</li>
    <li> It does fade your skin, however it is not fast and it takes a few weeks to see any affects and if you have sensitive skin, you might break out. For me it took three weeks to see anything and the skin started to break out. When I stopped using it my skin cleared up. I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and have already noticed some lightening on my melasma. I haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference in the acne scars I have, but the overall appearance of my skin is definitely brighter and smoother. It can be a little pasty when you put it on, but I just add a drop or two off coconut oil to it and that helps it absorb without flaking off. It does have an SPF, but I use extra to be safe.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 months now and I can see results already. It really worked for me.</li>
    <li> I really think if your skin is like leather this is for you.  Otherwise, stay away.  I followed the directions and then started cutting back when I noticed it was turning into red splotches.  I finally quit after a week or so.  I was so embarrassed to go out of the house.  All I wanted was to get rid of the red spots that were left after pimples came and left.  I am a strawberry blonde with fair skin.  The alpha hydroxy is the culprit.  I had high hopes.  This product deserves zero stars.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream after melasma developed on my jawline and cheek, on both sides of my face, thanks to hormonal birth control pills. It has been one month since I first started using it, twice per day for the first 3 weeks, and once per day for the 4th (most recent/current week), and I am pleasantly surprised by the way it has faded my melasma. It is still visible, but it is considerably lighter. I can now apply foundation and cover it easily, where before that was not the case. I plan to continue to use the cream for another couple of months, and then take the recommended rest from it. It it important to avoid the sun while using this, and to wear sunscreen with physical (not chemical) blocking agents, such as Titanium Dioxide, or the product will not work as effectively, and the discoloration will return. Be diligent about this! Exfoliation is key, too. You need to remove the top layer of darker pigmented cells now and then during this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product, is that if I apply it too thick, it can break me out a bit, with a single pimple here and there. Also, the smell isn&#x27;t great. It smells similar to hair bleach. Aside from those two downsides, it&#x27;s great. My routine at night (which is when I primarily use this cream) is this ... I wash my face, apply organic Retin-A serum, allow the serum to dry, apply a sensitive skin moisturizer, and on top of that, with a Q-tip, I apply the fade cream, only on the darkly pigmented spots. If you are wearing this during the day, be sure to use at least a 30 SPF physical block sunscreen, or your spots could darken, rather than lightening, based on the way that hydroquinone works.</li>
    <li> Before buying this I went through the reviews and reviews of similar products.  This one is cheap and was highly rated! My skin looks fabulous in the morning and my brown spots are fading. It does feel a little sticky but the results are worth it!</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE HORRIBLE PRODUCT ! THIS PRODUCT DRIED OUT MY SKIN TREMENDOUSLY ! IT DID NOT WORK  i would not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I have used this product and it works. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I believe in researching products prior to making purchases. I read lots of reviews and learned not all reviews are equal. Sometimes you have to read between the lines. I don&#x27;t know about you but I like reviews to be thorough which is why I am added so much information on mine. I hate reviews which state a product did not work and they include information that lets you know they did NOT follow directions or consistently use the product.     In the case of this product you don&#x27;t use this all over your face if your issue is a particular area. You are suppose to use a sunscreen of at least spf 15 AND avoid sun if you can when using this product. You are suppose to use it EVERYDAY! If you don&#x27;t you may not get your desired results. If you are extremely dark, you will have limited and possibly no results. Obviously you must be consistent and patient if you want results. You are suppose to continue occassional use once results are achieved. Get my point? READ THE DARN JAR, lol. So please be wary of reviews and read between the lines to see if it is a valuable review to base your purchase on. I am not saying anyone who says a product didn&#x27;t work for them is wrong. I am just saying make sure they are telling you the whole story to ensure you are getting enough information to make an educated decision.     I am a dark skinned African American woman. I would compare my complexion to actress Gabrielle Union. I have used this product for my uneven skin tone. The bottom of my face on the side of my mouth tends to be darker than the other 80 percent of my face. I have used this product in the past with results and then I stop. Of course when I do, the uneven tone eventually makes it way back. I am back to using it. It&#x27;s been only about 2 weeks and I see a little improvement already. This time I am using it in conjuction with african black soap (also sold on amazon) and my MK moisturizer w/ spf. This combo seems tomake my skin incredible soft and with a glow as well.     I plan to continue with this product along with the black soap so my skin evens out so I can just use a tinted moisturizer (with spf 15!) this summer. With the results I have seen so far, I am confident I will achieve this goal.</li>
    <li> A few years ago, I purchased this Skin Success Fade cream along with the Eventone body lotion, hoping to recover from an uneven tan/ sunburn gone stale (read greyish!) before a long awaited wedding of a close relative. My complexion is a light medium with a neutral tone, and in the sun I tend to burn on my face, shoulders and feet and tan and burn on my arms and legs- like a lobster left on the fire too long on one side only, not good and VERY uncomfortable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the skin burn had healed, I used the fade cream right after cleansing my face with the Clarisonic- it stung for a minute or two the first week and I got used to it after that. The results in just a week were extraordinary. Not only was all the grey gone, but my skin was transformed- I looked airbrushed right out of bed and had the bride from that wedding I attended ask me what I was doing! My skin was never perfect with an acned past, but this fade cream seemed to have exfoliated a layer or two of it away! I&#x27;ve never seen such results with any of the expensive Caudalie/ Organics/Estee Lauder/Artistry/ Clinique skin care products I&#x27;ve used in the past, and especially so much so fast. Needless to say, I&#x27;m taking it easy and do not use this cream constantly as I don&#x27;t want to overdo it and harm or burn my skin. I use it for a month every alternate night and then quit for another 2 months, skipping it in Winter altogether. As I use the Clarisonic regularly, I would think that the results last longer than if I were to use the fade cream alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Even tone body lotion is just as good as the fade cream and I use it through Spring and Summer- it truly does seem like I exercise every day even though this just brightens my skin!</li>
    <li> The active ingredient Hydroquinone (2%) is really the only important part of any cream that is used to fade dark spots on the skin.  This is the cheapest product that I could find that contains Hydroquinone (2%).  Some products only contained Hydroquinone (1%), which is half strength.  If you have trouble with skin care products, used the weak 1% version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to fading dark spots is daily treatment and staying out of the sun....forever.  Use max sunscreen when you drive or get out in the sun, or the sun spots/dark spots/age spots will simply come back.  The dark spots are due to melanin in your skin and are genetic.  If they run in your family, you will probably get them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes about 2 weeks of daily use to see the spots begin to fade.  So be patient and stay out of the sun.  It works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck fading away those spots!</li>
    <li> I loved this product and you can tell I got  10 boxes...which stated would expire 9/15.  I placed my order in 2013 and first few boxes were great the last few when I opened was dark brown to near black in color ..... I am in the process of calling Palmers ..until now no one has called back.......  .have any one else experience this with the above product ...please let me know</li>
    <li> did not work for me, waste of money. even the directions say discontinue use after three months if you see no improvement</li>
    <li> I love this product it worked!</li>
    <li> Hydroquinone is banned in Europe, as it has been linked to several different diseases, including cancer. The cream does soothes your skin and brightens it, however, it may cause skin irritation and your acne to reappear !! Even the ones that were subsided previously. Dark spot, blemishes, may be symptoms of some other underlying diseases or physiologic conditions. Consult a Doctor/Dermatologist specialist first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second jar.  I could reall see a difference is a few weeks.  I keep using it everyday and continue to see improvement.  I thought it make my face a little red in the beginning but it dosen&#x27;t do that any more.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any changes in my skin lately.</li>
    <li> But nothing is a miracle, so it&#x27;s a given.  I don&#x27;t use the product as much as I should, so I&#x27;m not seeing the results, but it&#x27;s okay.  I&#x27;ll get to it.</li>
    <li> Not a bad cream i did notice a slight difference with my discoloration skin but not a big difference smiling.</li>
    <li> I am using the product and I like it even I was skeptic about the effectiveness of the product.  It doesn&#x27;t say eliminate the black spots but fade the black spots.  Indeed, most black spots are getting thinner to almost gone.  There was one that still showing pretty dark and I hope it will go away too.  I only used this product for couple months.  Definitely recommended.  However, becareful if you have sensitive skin.  It may give you redness or rash.</li>
    <li> Works perfect for my 13 year old daughter, She can&#x27;t stand her freckles, After 1 month there is a difference.. Shes very happy</li>
    <li> I really am impressed with this product. I have a few good sized brown spots on my face,&lt;br /&gt;I tried another over the counter product and though it helped a bit nothing astounding, still I thought I would continue. I decided to switch products. Wow, withing 3 weeks I had a noticeable improvement.  Even the one brown spot I have had for 30 years is improved. I use this religiously twice a day. I have not had any noticeable redness nor have I broken out from the product. I do have a sort of warm feeling upon application for a bit of time but nothing that is bothersome. I woould highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I used this product not knowing how my skin would react to the Hydroquinone, and it made my skin EXTREMELY IRRITATAED. When using this product I developed small red irritated bumps on my skin and it looked like a bad rash.I stopped using it right away and it healed with some Aloe Vera, then about a year later I decided to give it another go, and I had the same reaction from when I first used it. Everybody&#x27;s skin is different and please be aware that Hyrodquinone is a potentially dangerous chemical, if you have sensitive skin then this is not for you. AND DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR FACE! Test it out first by using it on a small area on your skin.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent and did match my expectation beyond norms. .it is exactly what I was looking for and Amazon made it available for me</li>
    <li> The best thing about this stuff is that it works, and its not greasy. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase. Wish Amazon would do a subscribe and save with this product :).</li>
    <li> I like the thickness of this cream. It seems that it does what it purpots to do.I can tell my complexion is smoother since using this product.</li>
    <li> It is ok especially in this cold climate, i rub it on my elbows and it makes them soft and darkness on my elbows are pretty hard to remove, but it makes it look a bit cool, hope to see more progress.</li>
    <li> Skin Success Eventone Fade Cream, Regular - 2.7 oz works great and goes on smooth.  It does what it says claims.</li>
    <li> It says that you should see results in 2 weeks. Well, I didn&#x27;t, but I guess we all have different skin. I could start seeing results within the first month (right cheek &amp; forehead). It truly works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use it with a sunscreen though. Fade creams can potentially damage skin when the profuct is on and the skin is exposed to sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with the fade cream, I used Alba&#x27;s Skin Lotion w/h SPF 15 as well as Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Lotion during the night. On nights were it got really cold, I used Bio Oil on my face with the fade cream underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy a second bottle (well, jar) soon.</li>
    <li> If you have melasma like me this product won&#x27;t help you. You will need prescription creams ( hydroquinone, trimula etc) at $100 a tiny jar that will make the offensive patches disappear in two weeks. It is not covered by insurance but it is worth every single penny, visit your dermatologist for a prescription.     Why the 4 stars? Because this product is fine for maintenance after using the prescription and for improving overall texture of complexion. It brightens your overall tone, therefore not very good for patches. I use it over my prescription Obagi C (the one with hydroquinone and vitamin c) and it works well.    Do NOT rely on the paltry 10 spf that this cream has to keep the stains away, you will need spf 50 or at least 30 on your face everyday and a wide brim hat.    This cream is thick, it also not harsh.    Good product if your expectations are according to a $6 jar. If you have deep issues with skin discoloration, save your money and go to a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Every time I use this, I would immediately get red blotches on my face.&lt;br /&gt;And then when I wake up the next day, I would have huge pimples on my face. I think it&#x27;s because of the mineral oil, and the corn oil that they add to this product.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use this if you have acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin but didn&#x27;t damage it neitheR</li>
    <li> I Love This Product, It Works Great On My Face....I Received This Product Very Promptly &amp; I Am Very Satisfied With My Purchase.......Thanks</li>
    <li> This is not my 1st time using this product;I used it long time ago but I could not remember how it went especially since am not a mirror person to double check my skin progess. I bought it 2 months ago and used it for 2 weeks; I realised that my skin around my mouth was dry, peeling with black marks. I then stopped using it. Right now, my skin has gone back to normal. My skin tolerates the foaming soap better which I&#x27;ll continue using until it finishes. As for the cream, I&#x27;ll use it on only dark marks on my face to see how it works because before I was using it all over my face. But I like the texture as it goes well into the skin</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years for my back acne scars. I used it on my face a couple of years ago but my acne products take care of my facial scars so I just use it on my back now. It does work, but you have to use it consistently like twice a day (morning and night) to see quick results. Although I do wish it worked a little faster, but overall it does work. Don&#x27;t forget to use sunscreen on top of applying this cream on your scars to ensure they do not darken; which will slow down your results when using this product.</li>
    <li> Disappointed with scent as it doesn&#x27;t have a soft fragrance.  Husband has not seen significant results as he had hoped for.</li>
    <li> This product will fade spots but I have a really hard time finding creams like this that don&#x27;t have a horrible texture, this one included.  Any skin brighteners without a horrid waxy, greasy texture cost so much and don&#x27;t have the hydroquinone.  I am a white American of European descent with spiral curly hair (curly hair tends to mean dry skin)so products formulated for African skin types are generally appropriate for my skin as well. In this case, I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m just not quite dry enough to appreciate this product but for me it doesn&#x27;t really absorb but spends more time sitting on the surface of my skin leaving white waxy residue.  I could not wear this under make up.  I use this at night or on days when I don&#x27;t have to go out.  When I go out, I wipe my face with a damp cloth and then apply sunscreen and makeup.  I had a hormone imbalance that gave me terrible adult acne which left spots all over my face.  The plus side is, now that I have medically taken care of the hormone problem, this cream has made a great improvement in the scarring on my face.  I just wish it had a more lotion texture and could be worn under makeup.</li>
    <li> finally an inexpensive product that really works. I&#x27;m so happy to see my brown spots fade away. Would definetly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already have this product and ordered it in January. I decided to come online and write about how well its working and I plan to order more soon! I am a dark skinned african american women and have had discoloration on my face for years until I began to use this product. I only use this product, suncreen, along with carbolic soap and have seen a DRASTIC improvement. I was scared this would burn my skin or make me itch because I suffer from eczema and tend to have sensitive skin but no problems whatsoever! :)</li>
