      <li>These were all great samples and my wife really like them.  </li>
      <li>:):)</li>
      <li>I love these for my purse and for traveling.</li>
      <li>I would buy many, so would many people I talk to.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy I did because I do dislike one of the fragrances --- puts me in mind of my old Granny...</li>
      <li>The sizes are great to carry in purse not heavy at all.</li>

      <li>I would return it, but foolishly I threw away the packaging when I put the bottles (which look authentic enough) in my medicine cabinet, so</li>
      <li>It smells so pretty.</li>
      <li>I was excited to find this one on Amazon, but my advice is do not waste your money here.</li>

      <li>Much better than one big bottle of the same cologne.</li>
      <li>Cute little boxed set of EL fragrances.  </li>
      <li>It is a very complete set of perfumes...</li>
      <li>Your indeed worth every single spray</li>
      <li>this way, for the same amount of money as one large bottle, my friends have an option of scents to spritz on themselves.</li>
      <li>I really like every one of the fragrances, especially the Pure White Linen.</li>
      <li>Classy mixture of perfume  scents.</li>
      <li>I do not know whether they are not the real thing, or maybe old and just smell differently now, but either way they are a huge disappointment.  </li>
      <li>She was so excited to get them that she immediately opened the bag up and tried a few (one on one wrist, another on the other, etc.)</li>

    <li> I liked the pleasures bloom it does smell like Miracle by lanccome.  I also liked the pure whtie linen one too it was a floral fragrance but not annoying at all, it smells like fresh flower bouquet.  My least favorite was the Pleasures it is too floral and green for me so I gave it to my sister and she likes that perfume.  The sizes are great to carry in purse not heavy at all.</li>
    <li> Mom loved these travel sized fragrances!  Great gift to allow someone to find the specific scent they love the best!</li>
    <li> Just right for travel.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to a best friend. I&#x27;ve given this before as gifts but never through Amazon. Of course, Amazon makes delivery to out-of-state friends so much easier. She loved it, just as I thought. It&#x27;s always nice to have an assortment of sprays to carry with you. Also, I like that each bottle only has a little perfume, as I find so much gets wasted in the bigger bottles. this way, for the same amount of money as one large bottle, my friends have an option of scents to spritz on themselves. Really like this as a gift. Hey, maybe someone will send one to me one day?! :)</li>

    <li> I really like every one of the fragrances, especially the Pure White Linen. &amp;#34;The miniatures&amp;#34; are the perfect size to explore different perfumes without spending a lot of money. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Packaged Perfect &amp;#34;:) and is indeed -A beautiful way for all to enjoy the smells of every single bottle without having just one bottle:):) This is indeed a --Winner-- for all to give at any time :):) And Hey --Keep one for yourself to :):) Your indeed worth every single spray :):)</li>
    <li> I love these for my purse and for traveling. I don&#x27;t have to take my big bottles from my home. I can use these travel purse sprays. I just wished Estee Lauder would sell a Minature Collection with Spellbound, Cinnabar, Youth Due, White Linen, Private Collection Amber, this would be AWESOME. I would buy many, so would many people I talk to.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a gift.  Came in the mail just before Christmas. I gave this as a gift and the person seemed to enjoy the different fragrances.</li>

    <li> Hard to find Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder products in my town I can try different fragrenes I had only unused Beuteful love them all</li>

    <li> These do not smell to me like the real scents, which I have purchased many times. I do not know whether they are not the real thing, or maybe old and just smell differently now, but either way they are a huge disappointment.  I usually buy these travel sets in the duty free or on airplanes and they have always been great. I was excited to find this one on Amazon, but my advice is do not waste your money here. I would return it, but foolishly I threw away the packaging when I put the bottles (which look authentic enough) in my medicine cabinet, so I suspect I may have difficulty doing so.</li>
    <li> Tried every one of the scents. Love them all. Will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> I bought it to sample the products before I chose one or all. I&#x27;m happy I did because I do dislike one of the fragrances --- puts me in mind of my old Granny...lol .</li>
    <li> The mini selections gave me a chance to experience all the scents</li>
    <li> Cute little boxed set of EL fragrances.  Happy with purchase -thanks!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the box of the perfume. It smells so pretty.</li>
    <li> the packaging is lovely and the scents are divine.</li>
    <li> I love this collectipn of Estee Lauder. I use them all the time. Much better than one big bottle of the same cologne.</li>
