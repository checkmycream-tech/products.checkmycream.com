      <li>I recieve them and they are NOT the colors listed in the &#x27;view more photos&#x27;.</li>
      <li>[[ASIN:B001E90F24 10 cheap L.A.COLORS NEON BRIGHT Nail Art Polish cheap ART LACQUER]]</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for making my nails look amazing! :)</li>
      <li>I love how easy they are to use.</li>
      <li>I wish there was more of a variety of colors with it, such as yellows or oranges, but it&#x27;s a great price for them.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really easy with these.</li>
      <li>This brand is very good and lasts for a long time.</li>
      <li>then that everything is perfectly fine</li>
      <li>Will recomend all you wants to try their own nail design to buy these products.</li>
      <li>To be honest I was not expecting much with &amp;</li>
      <li>I received my polishes in a very reasonable manner and I would gladly reorder from this supplier.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not really disappointed with the colors.</li>
      <li>I ordered these nail polishes and was so excited got charged for them and they never came to my house.</li>
      <li>there fun colors to have in your collection!</li>
      <li>I got my 12 L.A Colors fast and I am satisfied with them and the brushes.</li>
      <li>but the picture doesn&#x27;t show the true colors in the collection</li>
      <li>I painted my mother&#x27;s nails over 3 days ago and the polish has chipped a bit, but for the price of these paints, it&#x27;s not bad.     </li>
      <li>the red glitter is kind of glumpy but works fine.</li>
      <li>I love them, but if you live by a Dollar Tree, get them there!</li>
      <li>Just make sure you know that you have a steady hand.</li>
      <li>so i got this product fairly quickly, and was expecting to get 10 polishes as stated, but ended up recieving 12.</li>
      <li>Its of reasonable rate and worth buying,just recommended this to all my friends :)</li>
      <li>These colors are so fun, they will get you out of the \\&quot;fall funk\\&quot; before you know it.</li>
      <li>However, it seems to thicken pretty quickly after a while.</li>
      <li>But other then that it&#x27;s a good purchase.</li>
      <li>the price is right..  </li>
      <li>Decent for cheap nail polish</li>
      <li>This is fantastic because the brush is much thinner and pointed than a regular nail polish we are most used to.</li>
      <li>I picked up the nail art talent a few years ago and i&#x27;ve become very good and drawing designs and making them look professional.</li>
      <li>I LOVE using striper polishes, so I got quite excited when I found these polishes at such a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>This a great buy, but only if your open to colors.</li>
      <li>Beautiful colours and long lasting even after plenty of washing and gardening.</li>
      <li>the colors werent exactly what was shown in the picture (1 or two different ones) but i am mostly pleased with my purchase</li>
      <li>I should have read the reviews first.</li>
      <li>Get ten for 10$ instead of 18$ :3</li>
      <li>so I was pretty bumed about that too.</li>
      <li>I have used all ten colors and am pleased with every one of them.</li>
      <li>Now I need to practice to do different types of designs with them :)</li>
      <li>I am pretty dissapointed with this product.</li>
      <li>You might be better off buying some nail art brushes, and using regular nail polish with them, or even acrylic paints you can buy in a craft store.</li>
      <li>I enjoy making new designs pretty much every day</li>
      <li>the colors I got weren&#x27;t the ones advertised, and it wasn&#x27;t really on time.</li>
      <li>She absolutely loves them.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast; I ordered them Sunday night and received them Wednesday.</li>
      <li>It can be tricky to get a straight line.</li>
      <li>Very dissapointed...</li>
      <li>i didnt get the colors gold and silver which i was really looking forward to using.</li>
      <li>Bottles break in the mail, and you may not get the whole set of 12 that you are supposed to get.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>this will make it easier to open the next time and it wont clump around the edges either :) and this goes for any nail polish        - Let me know if this helps anyone ;)</li>
      <li>very disappoint would like new ones or refund ASAP</li>
      <li>That was one of the main reasons for my purchase.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s highly recommended by me.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see why people are buying these so expensively at Amazon- you can get them at Dollar Tree  for just a buck!   The quality of these are great- the brush is perfect and everything, and they aren&#x27;t transparent. I love them, but if you live by a Dollar Tree, get them there!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought all sorts of colors and glittery ones at the dollar tree so 10 cost 10 dollars and you get your choose of colors just saying.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I purchased this item. I had read all of the negative reviews but decided to chance buying it anyways. I was very happy with this product though; I received all of the colors shown in the picture: Pink, purple, yellow, green, dark blue, black, white, a metallic silver, and two glitter silvers, one has big sparkles and one has little sparkles. Keep in mind that these brushes are made for nail art so they are very thin, they can be used to paint your whole nail but it would be more time consuming. The 10 polishes arrived in a small box insulated with packing peanuts and arrived undamaged. I have used all ten colors and am pleased with every one of them. Shipping was fast; I ordered them Sunday night and received them Wednesday. It appears the vendor has improved the product since reading the negative reviews. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Decent for cheap nail polish but it is sold at dollar stores EVERYWHERE, &amp;i would never ever pay more than $1 per bottle- any thing more than that is a rip off.</li>
    <li> I bought this and THOUGHT I was going to recieve the colors shown. That was one of the main reasons for my purchase. I recieve them and they are NOT the colors listed in the &#x27;view more photos&#x27;. They were random color some even the same. I was highly disappointed. I e-mailed the vendors about the problem because I didn&#x27;t want to write a bad review. Never heard back from them, ever. So all-in-all the product was alright, I mean they serve their purposse except for the fact that I DIDN&#x27;T recieve the colors I expected and the vendors didn&#x27;t respond.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 colors out of this lot (Pink, purple, black, and silver) and they are fantastic. I painted my mother&#x27;s nails over 3 days ago and the polish has chipped a bit, but for the price of these paints, it&#x27;s not bad.     This is fantastic because the brush is much thinner and pointed than a regular nail polish we are most used to. A few days before I bought them I was thinking about how I wanted them, but in Beauty stores they are so expensive. I walked into a store that never had them before and saw them. I jumped for joy. LOL! They were so inexpensive! I&#x27;m so happy with them. I can now do nail art at home for less than I could at a salon.     Just make sure you know that you have a steady hand. It can be tricky to get a straight line.</li>
    <li> i didnt even recieve my package i had to file a claim, they didnt even give a tracking number to know where it was</li>
    <li> Good products.  Will recomend all you wants to try their own nail design to buy these products.</li>
    <li> I bought these nail art polishes for my 12 year old daughter who loves to do her nails. She absolutely loves them. The polish goes on smoothly, and last for at least 3 days before it chips. That says a lot when you buy something so inexpensive. I will be buying her the larger set next. This is a great and inexpensive product if you like to experiment with nail art and don&#x27;t want to pay salon prices.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased the nail art design polish, I would have wanted to know if the 10 colors displayed on the site would be the colors that would be shipped. The polish had several duplicate colors.  I should have ask before purchasing, if the polish bottles were plastic or glass.  Several of the bottles were very difficult to open because the bottles where plastic. [[ASIN:B001E90F24 10 cheap L.A.COLORS NEON BRIGHT Nail Art Polish cheap ART LACQUER]]</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Dollar Tree in black and white. It&#x27;s affordable ($1 each!) A lot cheaper than for how much they sell here, and a lot cheaper compared to other stores.  However, it seems to thicken pretty quickly after a while. I haven&#x27;t even had it that long and it thickened (I didn&#x27;t even get to use it all).  I suggest ditching this brand, and heading over to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. Affordable and better quality!</li>
    <li> They sell this brand at the dollar store for $1 a bottle. That means you&#x27;re paying more here than you would be if you picked it up in the store. On top of that, it&#x27;s really bad quality and the brush is extremely long, which makes it unwieldy to use in any kind of precise way. I would not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> Love the product. They replaced the exploded polishes very quickly at no cost to me. I wish there was more of a variety of colors with it, such as yellows or oranges, but it&#x27;s a great price for them.</li>
    <li> I love these nail polishes! but I do have two secrets that you might want to know                  1. You can also buy them at any Honks store for a $1 each and on Tuesdays its only 88 cents! :)                                                  2. If you apply solar oil to the rim and twist the lid close and open it again (right when you first open it) this will make it easier to open the next time and it wont clump around the edges either :) and this goes for any nail polish        - Let me know if this helps anyone ;)thanks</li>
    <li> I am the type of girl that loves to do her nails, but don&#x27;t like to pay the salon people $30 or more to do them. I picked up the nail art talent a few years ago and i&#x27;ve become very good and drawing designs and making them look professional. To do most of my designs, I use nail art brushes which can be very expensive in stores. This brand is very good and lasts for a long time. Granted that you can find them cheaper in many dollar generals, they don&#x27;t have a large variety of colors to pick from and they may be hard in the store. All in all, if you&#x27;re like me and know what you&#x27;re doing with nail art or if you&#x27;re a beginner wanting to learn, these are very good and at a good price.</li>
    <li> i bought this thinking that i would recieve the colors shown in the picture, but instead i got colors that werent in the picture. i didnt get the colors gold and silver which i was really looking forward to using. the company should give you the colors shown in the picture and not some other random colors.</li>
    <li> This could have been a nice buy. All I can say is, there are only 2 sellers on Amazon selling this product. Before you buy the one that seems like a better deal, look at the customer feedback for each seller. Do not buy from any seller that has negative feedback, or you may end up with a less than satisfactory purchase/buying experience, to say the least. Bottles break in the mail, and you may not get the whole set of 12 that you are supposed to get. You don&#x27;t actually need a set like this. You might be better off buying some nail art brushes, and using regular nail polish with them, or even acrylic paints you can buy in a craft store. I kind of wish I had gone that route, as it would have saved me a lot of extra time and trouble.</li>
    <li> Was highly disappointed. Did not recieve the colors shown in picture. Plus not getting the colors shown on the picture also recieved a duplicate silver glitter.  Not to happy and company is shaddy.  FYI ladys order from another vender.  I should have read the reviews first. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake...</li>
    <li> I got my 12 L.A Colors fast and I am satisfied with them and the brushes. I was hoping that the green one is not glittery, but it is okay; I will still use it. Now I need to practice to do different types of designs with them :) Good luck to everyone!</li>
    <li> I ordered these nail polishes and was so excited got charged for them and they never came to my house. i am highly upset at the person selling and not even 1 email back when I sent several to #316</li>
    <li> Expected to get 10 different colors. Alot of the colors were the same color or very close shade to another</li>
    <li> Love the colors and perfect for nail art...Its of reasonable rate and worth buying,just recommended this to all my friends :)</li>
    <li> These colors are so fun, they will get you out of the \\&quot;fall funk\\&quot; before you know it.</li>
    <li> To be honest I was not expecting much with &amp;#34;10 cheap&amp;#34; in the title but I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of these.  Beautiful colours and long lasting even after plenty of washing and gardening. I enjoy making new designs pretty much every day and it&#x27;s really easy with these. Definitely a great buy for anyone wanting to try out nail art.</li>
    <li> Great! It was exactly what I expected! I really enjoyed this item! It&#x27;s highly recommended by me. It&#x27;s great! 😄</li>
    <li> These are by far one of the best brand of nail stripers I&#x27;ve encountered. I love how easy they are to use. They don&#x27;t get clumped up at all like other stripers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I received today and there are 2colors I got 2  or 3 of and not great colors that u would use much may I add two of the paints where open and spelled all over the other ones packed with it what a mess need better packing and make sure all bottles are closed tight before packing and shipping very disappointed. It contain 2 red witch one spelled 3 pinkishs colors one black sparkle one yellow one silver sparkle that spelled witch all over.. no blue no regular black not color shown at all.. very disappoint would like new ones or refund ASAP</li>
    <li> the colors I got weren&#x27;t the ones advertised, and it wasn&#x27;t really on time. I was kinda disappointed so yea</li>
    <li> makes for added beauty to my nails...</li>
    <li> I ordered several items off of Amazon with in two weeks and this was the first item I ordered, but it was the last one I received.  The colors were not all of the ones shown, but if you read it says 10 colors, and there are 12 shown.  It didn&#x27;t occur to me until I received it,  but you will NOT receive all the colors in the picture.  Also, the white had been opened it looks like and leaked all over the bottle.  I&#x27;m not going to try to contact the seller because the other reviewers said they&#x27;ve tried with no success.  I&#x27;m going to keep them because they are the only stripers I have and I&#x27;m not really disappointed with the colors.</li>
    <li> DO NOT buy these. In the store they are $1 a piece. You are overpaying if you&#x27;re getting only 10 for $15. Might as well run to the dollar store and pick up the colors you like instead of receiving the wrong colors &amp; overpaying.</li>
    <li> Sent me colors that weren&#x27;t neon at all!!! If your going to show those colors you should give them those colors.. How is black and silver neon. should tell people what colors there getting. such a scam!!!! Worst money I&#x27;ve ever spent!!! And there nail polish on the top of the handles.. Very dissapointed... Waited almost 3 weeks for crap!!! Don&#x27;t buy from here... stick to EBAY at least you know what your getting!</li>
    <li> I LOVE using striper polishes, so I got quite excited when I found these polishes at such a reasonable price. They took a week to arrive though... Anyways, I&#x27;m very happy with these since they are pretty good in quality. I was glad to find that the colors were opaque. But... I was a little upset when I didn&#x27;t get the yellow polish... and also the green one is more teal than green so I was pretty bumed about that too. Overall, I got what I paid for. If you&#x27;re looking for cheap striper polishes, then these are the ones for you!</li>
    <li> the colors are good and the brush is thin. the problem i have is that after awhile, my blacks get very thick - this makes it harder to create designs. and this happens to both my blacks, after awhile it gets thick and when i take it out it looks dry and creates this thick line for my designs - its hard to explain. but over all the nail polish is good if i dont count the two blacks.</li>
    <li> The package came very late. But other then that it&#x27;s a good purchase. My sister is into nail Art and these thin brushes help her out a lot to do the designs and be creative.</li>
    <li> For 17 dollars you can get 17 different colors at the dollar store. Don&#x27;t waste your money buying from here.</li>
    <li> I bought these at the dollar store before and they were awful. Not solid colors you need a couple coats. Also a bit runny. I would not buy this again I will pay the extra two dollars for higher quality nail art products at Salleys beauty store.</li>
    <li> I am pretty dissapointed with this product. I recieved 3 silver glittery ones, and I already own one! What will i do with 4 that hardly show up anyway? Buy from the dollar store, you get a beter variety.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the quality of my LA Colors Neon Bright Nail Polishes. I received my polishes in a very reasonable manner and I would gladly reorder from this supplier. Thank you so much for making my nails look amazing! :)</li>
    <li> so i got this product fairly quickly, and was expecting to get 10 polishes as stated, but ended up recieving 12. the colors werent exactly what was shown in the picture (1 or two different ones) but i am mostly pleased with my purchase</li>
    <li> They sell these same exact nail stripers at Dollar General for $1 each. You must like wasting money if you order this overpriced set.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors .Wonderful price and product.. Easy to use and the price is right..  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. !!!! Awesome</li>
    <li> Erm this is a reallyyyyyy great product i own most of these colors! But before you buy these you should check your local dollar store they sell this exact brand! Get ten for 10$ instead of 18$ :3 Just saying</li>
    <li> This set was perfect for my daughter&#x27;s mani/pedi birthday party.  Plenty if colors for the girls to choose from to make all kinds of creative designs.</li>
    <li> This a great buy, but only if your open to colors. This was a very inexpensive way to get a bunch of colors; however, I didn&#x27;t get all the colors shown, I got one or two different. I mean that&#x27;s ok, I just wanted all the colors shown, that&#x27;s why it gets 4 stars instead of 5</li>
    <li> i have recieved this product and to be honest, im satisfied with what i received because even though its not whats in the picture , at least its something. My only concern was that maybe like 2 was already open, i can tell because those two had a polish stain on the bottle. the red glitter is kind of glumpy but works fine. The only colors i did not receive was the glitter ones and the white but i already purchased white from family dollar so other then that everything is perfectly fine</li>
    <li> HEY EVERYONE! DID YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET THESE L.A. COLORS AT THE DOLLAR STORE FOR JUST $1!!! YOU ARE GETTING CHARGED 7 MORE DOLLARS AND THE PRODUCT ISNT EVEN THAT GOOD</li>
    <li> there fun colors to have in your collection! It&#x27;s good for anyone. and you&#x27;ll enjoy these! .. but the picture doesn&#x27;t show the true colors in the collection</li>
