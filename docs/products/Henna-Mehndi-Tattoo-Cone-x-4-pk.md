<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never ordered Henna before this, so I got on here having no idea what to look for. I saw this and thought, &#x27;Oh my! What a fantastic price! It must not be very good...&#x27; But I ordered it anyway, thanks to the other three reviews I read. It said it would be there in about three weeks, and that it would come with three cones. It arrived at my house about a week later, in perfect condition. Instead of three cones, there were four in the package!!! What a deal! I opened it up and began to design! The henna stains amazingly and lasts for a very long time! It&#x27;s easy to use and a wonderful product. I bought it again, in the hopes that I would use the henna to work at a fair, and instead of three or even four cones in each pack.... there were FIVE in each! I was sooooo happy! I&#x27;m so glad I bought this product! I highly recommend it!!! :)</li>
    <li> Ok so My henna arrived earlier this week and when i opened it up,  the whole box was messy and henna was splattered all over inside (im guessing maybe from the heat...but idk). Thankfully the henna wasn&#x27;t opened and I was able to clean the whole container and then wipe off the excess on the henna cones and then place them back inside. Even though, i think the packaging was not well put together. But the henna works well and looks fine so that&#x27;s good!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using henna and I was very happy with this product. I recieved 3 cones neatly placed inside a plastic box which protected them from rupturing. The cones did not rupture during the shipping process but 1 did leak a little, but not much. Overall, the color pay off is great, the henna stains very quickly and dark, so within about just 1 hour, you&#x27;ll already see a dark stain. I will purchase this product again in the future, it is great quality henna and the price is just out of this world! The shipping is about $10. The shipping was very fast, I received my package after about 1 weak &amp; a half after ordering it! If you are a beginner at mehndi or are experienced, this henna will most definitely not disappoint! Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This was a wonderful product.  Very easy to use and long lasting once applied.  Came very quickly.  Also came with a personal note.</li>
    <li> This product works wonderful. It stains very well, lasted more than two weeks. It has kept pretty long as well.</li>
    <li> Great price.. except for shipping.  The henna leaves a beautiful, even color.  I left it on for about an hour and it was bright orange at first but darkened significantly over the next day or so to a golden brown.  Lasted about a week in a half.  I have tons of leftover henna and have found that using a partially full cone that has already been opened works the same as a freshly opened one so I don&#x27;t have to waste any.  So much fun to use!</li>
    <li> Good quality and lasts for about 2 weeks. If you want a lot of henna for not much money, this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT IS EXACTLY WHAT MY GRANDDAUGHTER WANTED. SHE USUALLY HAS TO WAIT FOR THE L.A. COUNTY FAIR TO GET HENNA BUT, NOW SHE CAN DO WHENEVER SHE WANTS TO. PRODUCT ARRIVED IN TIMELY FASHION AND WAS WELL PACKAGED. THANKS FOR GREAT SERVICE. LYNNE</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product. Not that it didn&#x27;t work, it lasted for about a week on the top of my hand. However, I was seriously disappointed in the packaging. My product came to me leaking. It was wrapped poorly in bubble wrap and must have popped in travel. It was really gross and sticky, as it like two weeks to arrive. I would buy the product again because it works for fun events (I used it for a dance) but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily go through the same seller.</li>
    <li> After going to the mall and having. Henna tattoo done their for my sister. She decided she wanted to buy her own henna tattoo cones. We looked and compared and we went with these because the reviews were high. After applying and letting the paste dry it turns orange and a day later it is dark brown. One suggestion i have is to let the paste dry and flake off on its own to get the best results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that the shipping does take longer than usual. I think it took about 2 weeks for mine to get here. When I opened the box to make sure everything was ok, I realized I had gotten 4 cones instead of 3. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> The price is amazing! As well as the cones themselves! there three little cones, packaging was decent in a box and bubble rapped! the color is great and the texture of the mehndi! will order again &amp; suggest to my friends!</li>
    <li> product arrived incredibly quickly - and 3 tubes exactly as described. It took almost 48 hours but the color did darken to a nice brown and I would happily order again!</li>
    <li> One came Squish not badly but yea, Its my first time buying something like this. I guess i would buy it from here again. I was hoping for an extra cone because i read reviews where people saying they got and extra one and i didn&#x27;t lol so i was kind of sad. I did some design in my hand like 2 days ago and its gotten darker so yeah buy it because its good.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and the color is great. Wears off in the right amount of time. For a first time henna user, I was very pleased with both product and speed of shipping. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Like others stated I got 4 tubes, and it came in a nice plastic box. I&#x27;ve only done one design so far but it turned out great. Look up some tips online to get the tone of henna you want in your design.</li>
    <li> When I got this it was packaged neatly and sealed in a plastic bag. Unlike the other reviews that got 4 cones I only got 3 but that was ok. The product is easy to use and smells amazing. Obviously the longer you leave it on the better.after that I got a beautiful deep orange color. I also read that if you mix lemon juice with some sugar and dab it on after it sets the henna will last longer. Hope this helps. I will def be buying more from this seller.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews about this product, I just knew it would be fabulous! NOT!!! This stuff didn&#x27;t work not one bit! No staining, no color, NOTHING... Just a rancid smell. It gets one star because it does have 4 tubes instead of 3, but who cares when the dog gone product doesn&#x27;t even work!</li>
    <li> My friends and I used these squeeze cones on our hands, legs, stomachs. It stayed on for about three weeks! Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this to do my own henna tattoos on my daughter and myself, since the tattoos at the mall are all $10 EACH!! Only downside is I am a crappy artist LOL So ours don&#x27;t look as nice! Great for more artistic people, or maybe get a stencil.</li>
    <li> I was so thrilled when I received my mhendi. The shipping was great, the over all price was unbeatable, and the actual product is ovbiously high quality. The henna goes on dark and stays on your skin for a while, which is the mark of fresh henna. The tubes also come in a convenient case.</li>
    <li> This is my first henna. I thought it was a good product. Though it takes a long time to dry. First its a light gold color but deepens in time.</li>
    <li> Henna exceeded my expectations. It was just like the henna I bought in Nepal. Lasts for a good amount of time too!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant about this purchase at first but I&#x27;m really glad I tried this out. I love it. It lasts such a long time and it doesn&#x27;t give you an irritation or anything. I have sensitive skin so I would know. I recommended this to all my friends and to anyone else!</li>
    <li> I love the product and would recommend it to everyone.  It is great and I would purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the products arrival time. The product had a nice consistency and was easy to use. I experienced a little irritation where it was applied until it dried. The stain darkened after the product had been removed. I was not pleased with the short amount of time it lasted. Henna typically lasts at least two weeks. Mine started fading after four days. It&#x27;s more like the stain sheds off leaving a little yellow stain on my skin. If that. The henna is completely gone in a week. Over all I suppose you get what you pay for and I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> The color lasted about a week and didn&#x27;t fade very well, but that might&#x27;ve been because I applied it in the bitter cold and not in any sort of heat.  Other than that, there&#x27;s nothing to either bemoan or extol.</li>
    <li> This was impressively cheap, even considering shipping.  I really wanted a fast pack of henna to practice with, because I&#x27;ll be doing my friend&#x27;s wedding henna in a few weeks.  When the henna arrived, it came with an extra cone (thanks!).  The cones are all reasonably sized; I&#x27;ve done one palm design and two foot designs on one cone and haven&#x27;t finished the cone yet.  Since the henna was so cheap, I wasn&#x27;t sure that the quality would be very good, and I expected very light stains.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  They stained fast, which was sped up with a little heat and a sugar seal, and my hand was stained a very dark brown which is still here a week later.  I&#x27;m very satisfied, and will definitely order these again next time I need some.</li>
    <li> My Middle Eastern friends and I have tried before to find good henna for them. They were delighted with this... it was their favorite product they had found in America so far (we are not in a big city so local options are limited). The most like what they had at home, and darkest one, and a good price. Depending on how long you leave it on (and if it is on hands, how much you wash them) I&#x27;ve seen it last 5 days to almost 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They cut a small opening in the bottom of the tube, and wrap clear tape around it to make the opening as tiny as possible. Then just squeeze on, varying the heaviness for different parts of the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also received 4 cones in the pack. For some reason each cone was smaller than what I expected seeing the pic, but it goes a long way. It&#x27;s a great price, good quality, and conveniently packaged. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, lots of ink in each tube, easy to dispense from tube, lasts about 10 days, more brown than red,  this is the best pre-mixed henna I have used. highly reccomend!</li>
    <li> Bought this not expecting much. Just applyed it and the result was a nice brown color that is sure to darken in the next 24 hours. Very surprised that this henna is of this quality considering it is a premixed paste. I highly reccomend this product. Not to mention they gave me 4 cones instead of 3! Yippee!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fun to use but you must be careful and be sure to store in resealable bag or it will dry out.</li>
    <li> The cones are packaged and sent very nicely and on time. Only annoying part is the pins that are inserted to avoid henna spillage and to keep the tip open had either not been packaged right or had just been thrown into the box for the receiver to use. So when I received the cones, the tips were closed because the tip of the henna had dried out and i really had to struggle to get them open again. Once I got through that, the henna came out alright. It&#x27;s kind of thick so it&#x27;s a little harder to get it out but the color is really nice. Definitely user friendly cones and I would recommend them! If you&#x27;re a professional, though, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them because the thickness of the paste makes your hand hurt after a while.</li>
    <li> I am a beginner at using henna tattoos and even more so with applying them myself but I have found the cone for this product to be very easy to use. Few things I have learned is when snipping the cone, make sure to get as close to the tip as possible to allow for a more precise application of the henna. I snipped the tip of the cone a little too high causing the lumen to be bigger which lead for the henna paste to come out thicker which can be detrimental if you want thin lines. Also, the packaging advises removal of the henna in 1 hour but I have found leaving it on as long as possible waiting the paste to crud and begin to naturally fall off will give you a more darker, rich color and the tattoo will show more.</li>
    <li> I ordered two 3 pack cones, they arrived on time &amp; I got extra cones!! very pleased overall. the color is a nice dark brownish red &amp; much nicer than mixing your own. I a snip with the sisscors &amp; you can change the size that it comes out as :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty nice but didnt stain as much as i would have liked. GREAT for the price though. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I ordered this henna for my birthday party when it arrived I was very happy. It was in great packaging and the henna was easy to apply and we got a lot of use out of it. Also it left a dark brownish black stain.</li>
    <li> This henna is the best i have ever tried. I also loved the packaging. I got 4 tubes insted of 3 which was an added plus. It also came in a nice little plastic box. The color lasts long and leaves a dark color</li>
    <li> I ordered this item to play around with henna and see what i could do with it. After having received this item super fast and well packaged in a plastic and bubbled wrapped container I could not wait to start designing. When I opened the container they weren&#x27;t only 3 cones but 4!! Completely impressed by this service and had to buy again, and I did! I could tell the henna was fresh by just the smell, It was dark when applied and the stain as well was very rich and dark! I will def be buying again from this seller, price was great, amazing quality and customer service!</li>
    <li> The item shipped extremely fast!!... I tried it out the day i got it and you could smell that the henna was fresh!...The stain is a beautiful reddish brown on my skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect for first time henna artists. It came at a great price and got here early. I definitely recommend them</li>
    <li> The henna doesnt apply as well as henna should. It is a lot thinner in consistency than it should be which makes it spread when applied. If you are looking to use this for large designs or as a filler than it is ok, but don&#x27;t expect to get intricate details with this product. I even refrigerated this product in hopes of getting it to thicken (I figured, maybe the heat in shipping might have affected it), but it still is too thin to use. There is better henna out there for the same price or just slightly more money.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this henna. It leaves a nice dark red/brown stain, even after leaving it on for just a couple hours. I have kept it in the fridge and after four months I still have some left that stains well. The cone it comes in is great, too, although it doesn&#x27;t work so well for fine, intricate designs or small writing. Even so, I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Extremely inexpensive, but very high quality product. It left a very dark stain and was easy to work with. Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Even though the Henna wasn&#x27;t exactly the one pictured as the product, it came (3 tube, just what I ordered) very well packed and without any damage what-so-ever. The product was a little watery so I let it sit overnight and in the morning it was ready to use, even though the design wasn&#x27;t as dark as I had hoped, it was not bad henna and I could tell it was completely natural (meaning no PPD&#x27;s)</li>
    <li> It was great quality for henna, unfortunately it left this weird odor that lingered around for a few hours. It irritated everyone in my house</li>
    <li> this henna stains nicely and has lasted a decently long time. my only complaint is that it does have a sharp and unpleasant odor, but it&#x27;s not unbearable. otherwise I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great product! Arrived on time and with an extra tube! Was shipped in a great clear plastic snap carrying case and even stored well. Well worth the money, it&#x27;s a quality product.</li>
    <li> This product is of quality and I would recommend it to anyone. Although I did not receive four 3 it is still nice. The cone allows you to  apply the product without having to stop as much. Also it has a nice dark stain the next day so don&#x27;t be alarmed if it&#x27;s not dark when you take it off. Overall great product.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 tubes, and got 4 so i was already happy. The timing on recieving the product was fast, also. The henna lasts long and is well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> My henna just got in the mail this morning after a week before from ordering it. The shipping could be better. But overall the packaging came in good condition as well as the cones! And not only did i get three cones as ordered i also got amd EXTRA one, even better! ! :p i will deffinately be buying this product again from them.</li>
    <li> The henna arrived (3 cones) inside a thin paper cardboard box, and in a bubble wrap envelope. some of the tips were slightly bent, but didn&#x27;t affect their use. The stain from the henna was great, and the tubes were definitely full (maybe almost too full, as when i took the pen out the henna starting coming out without having to squeeze it at all). I am very happy to have found good henna online, and $5 for 3 tubes in the US is a pretty good deal.</li>
    <li> exactly what i needed one tube gets alot of space covered..already done 5 designs and not even done with one tube</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews and hearing that people liked the henna and also received 4 instead of only 3 cones, I thought this would be great for my daughters, who enjoy applying the henna designs to themselves and friends.  The product came well packaged and did, in fact, have 4 cones in the box.  However, after my daughters used it with their friends and I asked them what they thought, the overwhelming response was that it didn&#x27;t really work very well.  The reason being that it stained very lightly and faded quickly.  If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re hoping for, this product is great for you.  If you&#x27;re looking for a henna that will stain darker and last longer, another product would be better.</li>
    <li> This product worked well, produced a dark stain, and was very easy to use. I recommend it highly for henna.</li>
    <li> I also recieved 4 cones instead of 3, a nice surprise. As a beginner they work well for me. The only complaints I have are that they weren&#x27;t as well packaged as I might have liked, I got a bit of liquid that had leaked out on my hands when I picked them up, so I would recommend using some kind of gloves for the hand that will be touching them. All in all, though, it was well worth the price and took only a little over a week to get to my house from the day I bought it. It&#x27;s very easy to use, great for a first time henna user.</li>
    <li> The cones I received were not the same as the ones pictured. I got four cones of incredibly terrible quality henna. It barely stains and the stains don&#x27;t last. I left one design on for seven hours and sealed it with sugar/lemon juice  and it still was just a faint orange and barely there. Huge disappointment. I know it&#x27;s cheap, but it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> My henna came in really quickly! It smells amazing and you can smell it for a couple of days! I really love the way it prints on the front of your hand! I like the quality though it does get hard to use when it starts running out overall this is the best purchase I have ever made.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to find henna that had really good reviews and so I ordered it. The delivery date was as expected but when I opened the package the tubes were alot smaller than I thought they were going to be and they looked nothing like those in the picture. Nevertheless, I opened up the henna and waited an hour and then the henna started to fall off. I was thoroughly disappointed when it barely left any stain. It honestly just looked like dirt was on my foot. I am fully discouraged of ever purchasing henna again.</li>
    <li> So I guess the large cone is the same amount as 3 little cones. and if u order 6 they send u a cool little storage container that locks tight.</li>
    <li> For henna this is a great product. The color showed up on my skin fairly quickly and it was easy for my friend to squirt out of the cone. It came with one additional cone which was awesome! The result was very nice and got lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> it works and the color comes out good i got it just to practie lil tattoos and i liked them did last long whih i liked too just in case i messed up lol</li>
    <li> Received four cones instead of three...the ink is beautiful once it sets in for only 30 minutes.... I will buy from this seller again . The paste doesnt run either which is much better than the ones found at the whole food stores in my area.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal service. Got exactly what I wanted. Thanks for that. A trusted user, cant find that everyday again thanks :)</li>
    <li> It was great, I received 4 cones in the package. The only problem I had with this product that the henna doesn&#x27;t really last long, maybe about a week or less. Over all, its fun and if you are looking for something that wont last for too long then this is the product to go.</li>
    <li> This is a very easy way to apply henna if you are just starting out.&lt;br /&gt;The only flaw I notice was the flow consistency.</li>
    <li> Luv this! I am new to Mehndi and I&#x27;m learning how to apply the designs from a Beginner&#x27;s kit and online tutorials. I am dark-skinned and the color of this mix came out a vivid, dark maroon on the back of my hand and leg (test area), but on my palm it stained almost Black. The stain of this mix lasted longer than expected considering that I often didn&#x27;t cover during dish-washing and housecleaning. And I left the first cone I used in the refrigerator almost a week between my first 3 uses and it still stained dark just like first time. I did swab my designs w/the lemon/sugar and covered w/plastic wrap for 4-6hrs. I would&#x27;ve gotten more uses from the one cone if I was a better artist. But I need more practice before I use another of my cones, because they stain so dark and the mix starts to stain so QUICKLY.  Altho the price was excellent, I can&#x27;t afford to mess up a design or I&#x27;ll have to live with it for AT LEAST 2 weeks. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve henna&#x27;d about two dozen people so far, and I&#x27;ve only gone through two tubes. This stuff will last you for a while. It&#x27;s darker than some other henna I&#x27;ve used before too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used this product before, but thought it would be fun to try. It was advertised as a 3 pack, but it came with 4. It is really easy to use and produces a nice dark stain on the skin. I intend to buy this again.</li>
    <li> I used these to help close or unit on Ancient India.  The girls loved getting henna done and the boys didn&#x27;t mind temp tattoos.</li>
    <li> This product is good. Exactly as offered. Not as dark as i would like, but it does the job. Kudos.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I love giving myself henna tattoos and now all of my friends are asking me to give them some. I have already done more than ten (good size) hennas and I still have one and a half cones left!</li>
    <li> Product does what it should and we even got 4 instead of 3! It satisfies my 15 year old daughters needs for a tattoo.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve never purchased prepared henna before, but this was a great consistency and my teenage son is having a great time giving us beautiful tattoos!  After about 5 days mine is starting to fade.  I&#x27;ll be buying more before summer!</li>
    <li> Works great kids love it so happy i will be buying more this fun stuff ty vm good day to u</li>
    <li> Great product.. I use it as nail polish.. it works great and lasts long... I definitely remmomend it. ... ..</li>
    <li> I bought a set, and it was my first time using henna, and I wanted to practice before I started making my own. There was enough description to help me buy and it&#x27;s a great price. It was easy to use and I even stored the extra in a little plastic bottle I had and used it again. I recommend this product, especially for beginners.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly, and these prefilled cones are filled with best henna I have used. The stains come out dark, and hold their color and stain for several weeks! Very easy to use, no clumping or large chunks like other mixes. Extremely happy with this product!</li>
    <li> The henna came as quickly as it was ordered! The color is beautiful and dark! Love, Love, Love this product!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this henna at first, but I really like it now. It comes ready to apply so there is no mixing and waiting, it stains dark and stays for quite a while. Love it.</li>
    <li> This product arrived very quickly in its own little plastic box. One of the cones leaked a bit, but cleanup was easy and not much had escaped.&lt;br /&gt;Works as described.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Not the best quality (doesn&#x27;t last weeks and weeks), but very good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I keep mine in the refrigerator when I&#x27;m not using it. This keeps it fresher for longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of henna on myself before and was optimistic about these cones considering their good reviews. When I received my package, I found the henna worked well, applied smoothly, and left a nice stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, about 5 days after applying my first henna with these cones, I noticed my skin starting to crack and peel off only on the areas where the henna was applied, despite the fact that I frequently moisturize and did nothing to change my normal skin products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing some research/asking around I found that this is usually caused by using henna that was mixed with harsh chemicals in order to deepen the stain and keep the henna fresh for longer. I do not have sensitive skin, and I could imagine this would be much worse for someone who was sensitive to chemical products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would consider looking elsewhere for a henna that is marked \\&quot;100% chemical free\\&quot; or \\&quot;no chemicals added.\\&quot; There are many of these also available on Amazon.</li>
