<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Softening cream,&amp; very soothing</li>
    <li> great night time product!</li>
    <li> Although I have used this product for 2 years now without any problems all of a sudden the quality has gone down. THERE WERE GLASS  SHARDS IN THIS MOST RECENT JAR !!! Between the bad results from the serum and the obviously dangerous contents in this jar I have switched back to Estee Lauder products. My skin cleared up within 24 hours.</li>
    <li> i have rosacea this specific product in this product line works better than anything else i have tried.</li>
    <li> I agree with other customers that I dont believe this product is the real thing</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I am 62 and very picky about my skincare.  I am very dry and this light moisturizer works so well,&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe i am wearing any cream.  I would combine it w/ the AC,E serum for great results.</li>
    <li> great product for post menopause/combination dehydrated skin</li>
    <li> Love this repair creme.  It is the best repair creme I have ever found and used.  The vitamin C really helps clear up my skin and keep it looking young.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works wonders. My skin has lost all redness, fine lines diminished, all plumped up.</li>
    <li> An amazing product!!! Totally recommend !</li>
    <li> The orange smell is amazing and it feels truly luxurious on my skin. My face has less redness and for the first time in a long while my skin isn&#x27;t flaking in the Chicago bitter cold winter. I use this every night and morning and my skin has improved greatly-it&#x27;s moisturized, has a more even complexion, and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this lovely smelling hydrating cream!</li>
    <li> Love this hydrating cream. Smell good and leaves you skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Been using for some time now.  Mild to the skin.</li>
    <li> The image skin care vital c helps my foundation go on smoothly.i very much enjoy using Image care vital c. It is the perfect moisturizer under my foundation. It helps give my skin a natural look.</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever put on my face!</li>
    <li> Something about this cream isn&#x27;t right - it actually burns my skin around my eyes. The creme I purchase at the salon has never done that, so I just use what I purchased here on my hands.</li>
    <li> It feels good on my face.  It smells nice.  It is a  natural, not artificial scent. Does not do anything but give some moisturizing. Nothing compares to the Camocare  that I used to use until the company was sold and the products changed.  That was the best. It did actually hydrate and get rid of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Smells like oranges I use it in the evening, and I am surprised how it evens out my skin. It feels great and I don&#x27;t have to use it all the time I just use it a few times every two wks. I bought this from my local day spa where I get facials, after they put on the product I was hooked. I love the way it moisturizes and how soft my skin feels. I use my original Neutrogena Complete Acne System to keep my face clear, and I use this on occasion to moisturize it when it needs it during harsh summer days or winter when its the most dry outside. I have extremely sensitive skin and its hard to find products that work without me breaking out. I wish this was sold at more places besides my local facial place, and I could buy it as a consumer, but you have to be some licensed professional to order it on the website. I am so glad it is offered here on Amazon just wish they would keep it in stock, since buying it at a day spa is very expensive. Otherwise it is definitely worth it, I love it!</li>
    <li> This has worked well for my skin in a dry climate.  But not five stars as it is very expensive.</li>
    <li> Very hydrating and smells great!!  I use this at night and Vital C Anti-Aging Serum in the day. I make my husband use it and his skin looks so much better than his friends.  Really works!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this creme for 4 yrs now, it hydrates very well.  it makes my skin glow, I&#x27;ve tried other cremes and always come back to this one</li>
    <li> This seems to be the real deal, comparing it to the one I bought  at my local salon. I like this stuff, it&#x27;s really moisturizing and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Excellent skin cream.. the best.. product junkie.. I try everything and this one is by far the best!</li>
    <li> Great for adolescent conditions</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time last night before bed and my skin actually felt hydrated when I woke up this morning.  I really love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This product hydrated my face,I&#x27;m happy with the results</li>
    <li> Deep moisture for night time use.  Love the feel and light smell</li>
    <li> I have had red, blotchy skin my whole life, which has until now been treated with acne solutions.  I ended up going to a spa for a facial because I had a gift card, and they used the Image Vital C products on my face.  I noticed an instant change, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I started with the trial sized kit and have become a habitual user!  I use this creme morning and night; it&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause any problems with my sensitive skin.  More importantly, it has made my skin less red and overall healthier!  I also use the face wash and mask.</li>
    <li> This repair creme is a great addition to my morning make up regime.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy yet it feels like it is doing the &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34; of making my skin feel tighter.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Buyer beware!  Only buy from a licensed esthetician or doctor.  This stuff is NOT the real deal.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my sixties and have super sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years and couldn&#x27;t ask for a better hydrating night cream.</li>
    <li> Since I came across Image skin care, I&#x27;ve been addicted. Expensive, but a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Love this product for my skin. I am 47.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, and like the hydrating facial cleanser, has this wonderful orange scent.</li>
    <li> My salon sells this brand for twice as much as I paid on Amazon.  A very nice, light day cream.  I use the heavier-duty Image Max at night.  Am a fan of Epicuran and Pevonia also.</li>
    <li> Best night cream! Taking care of your face is do important and this product gives your skin the help it need to stay healthy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product about a year and it does an awesome job.&lt;br /&gt;I began using it after microdermabrasion and it leaves my skin feeling&lt;br /&gt;healthy.</li>
    <li> Fantastic moisturizer.  Very fresh vitamin C scent!</li>
    <li> This feel awesome on your skin and I love the smell of it. Good item and arrived at the time they said it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My botox nurse sells this but Amazon sell it for much cheaper which swayed me to buy it on Amazon.  &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> It is a good product than I continue to buy!  I like the smell and the way it works on my face.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for dry aging skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over three years with good results.</li>
    <li> I love this product. people they thought that I look 40&#x27;s but in reality I am already 57 years old!</li>
    <li> I rated it high because it worked just like it should. Image Skin Care is great for senitive skin:)&lt;br /&gt;And it is somuch cheaper on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is the best cream ever it smells so good and my face feels wonderful. Not heavy at all. Love all the C line products!</li>
    <li> This creme pampers my skin before I go to bed. I awake with softer more supple skin. I love the Image skin care line. It is also great to travel with in tiny containers.  A little bit goes a very long way!</li>
    <li> This item came super fast!!!!!!!! I love it!!!!!!!! I would repurchase! Vitamin C does a major difference to your skin!</li>
    <li> Gives great moisture to the skin.  A little goes along way and it is very gentle.</li>
    <li> Work great. However,  it&#x27;s a night creme ( for night skin repair). The discription of the product needs to include it.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  I have normal skin, that sometimes gets dry in the winter, so this product is perfect.  My only compaint is that I run out too soon, so I wish there was a larger container or it was just a bit cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It moisturizes well. You can use all over your face even around eyes. It smells great too.</li>
    <li> One of my friends who works at a spa told me about this product line and I REALLY love it. My skin is more on the dry side, especially during the colder weather months.  Using it twice daily in the summer can be a little much but just at night worked fine for me.  I would absolutely recommend using the hydrating serum with it as well. Smells really good, slightly orange but not over perfumed.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite skin cream out there right now and is well worth the price. It works well on both my oily and dry skin areas on my face and keeps my skin feeling super hydrated, soft and supple. I saw on Dr. Oz the anti aging properties of oral phytoceramides, CoQ10 and Reservatrol supplements, and I tried Renuvaderm and PhytoDerm PhytoDermTM- The Best 100% Pure Skin Restoring Anti-Aging Phytoceramides, 350mg! Clinically Proven! Facelift in a Bottle - As seen on Dr. Oz! Help Your Skin Look Younger And More Vibrant - Sells Out Fast! B00IT4POOG and B00JK5ZN76 Renuvaderm - The Most Complete Anti-Aging Skin Supplement! CoQ10, Resveratrol, DMAE, Polypodium Leucotomos, Phytoceramides, Vitamins A &amp; C for Younger Looking Skin! Clinically Proven Ingredients to Help Restore and Renew Your Skin and Make You Look Youn... and found that each of these were like botox in a bottle!. Combine the skin vital care crème with these oral supplements for the best results. My friends all think that I had botox!</li>
    <li> Have ordered this product before and love it</li>
    <li> So much cheaper than at my salon and the same stuff!!! Love it and it lasts a full year!</li>
    <li> IT WAS WHAT I EXPECT AND NOTHING MORE BUT IT WAS WHAT I WANTED AND WAS RIGHT ON ..STILL WRITNG STATEMENT</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!!!!! I have tried many and have found that this one is the best for my skin. My pores are smaller, brown spots are faded,and&lt;br /&gt;my skin has a smooth radiant glow</li>
    <li> Image skin care vital C completely hydrates my skin.  As soon as I apply it....it soaks in and plumps up my skin.</li>
    <li> I first discovered Image Skin Care when I was looking for a sunscreen I could wear on my face daily. I HATE every sunscreen I have ever tried for my face. They feel weird, smell weird, don&#x27;t go on well underneath my make up, or the spf is like 5 and basically ineffective. I know I am reviewing the repair creme here, but I will get to that in a minute. The Prevention + (spf 50) daily ultimate protection moisturizer is HANDS DOWN the greatest skin care product I have ever encountered. I was so obsessed I used it in the morning and at night because not only does it smell amazing (not perfumey at all, it barely has any fragrance--I like it because it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen) but it made my skin feel fresh and clean, and somehow it even made my skin significantly clearer when I used it consistently. And by the way, I love it so much I have bought it as gifts many, many times, and the recipients have always loved it, used it all, and bought more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to branch out and look for something that might be a little be more moisturizing and helpful for my skin the long run. I am nearing my late twenties and feel like it is time to start doing something preventatively as I am noticing the appearance of some very fine lines. I bought this hydrating repair creme because I wanted to try something else by Image Skincare. Well, when I first purchased it I was mildly disappointing. It is much heavier than the sunscreen (which is light as a feather) so it didn&#x27;t feel the way I expected. However, it does smell amazing. It smells like fresh oranges. I used it maybe once or twice here and there when my skin got really dry, but otherwise I put it away in a drawer and forgot about it. I continued with my sunscreen day and night routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I started getting more into make up and reading books, watching tutorials, etc. One of the books I read stated that great looking make up starts with taking care of your skin. It emphasized the importance of moisturizing and using eye cream, which I have basically never done aside from my beloved sunscreen. Giving in to my curiosity to see if more moisturized skin actually made any different to how my make up goes on, I started using this forgotten cream on a nightly basis. I can&#x27;t remember exactly what day I started this, but it has been maybe 1-2 weeks. I CANNOT believe the difference it has made!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t specifically noticed a difference with my make up since I&#x27;ve changed what make up I wear as well, but what I can&#x27;t believe is how different my skin looks! All of my fine lines that were bugging me are gone. Like they were never even there. Specifically one above my lip that was clearly the start of a lip wrinkle (lip wrinkles run rampant in my family--sorry, mom). It has vanished. My skin just looks much healthier and younger. It is smooth and soft, and I feel like the color of my complexion is better. I am so bummed I didn&#x27;t give this product a chance when I first got it. It doesn&#x27;t work overnight (as I clearly expected it to before) but it makes quite a difference very quickly! I can&#x27;t wait to see how things change in a few more weeks! In no way did I expect this product to make the difference that it has. I just expected it to keep things from getting dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had good luck with previous attempts at moisturizers like this. I have sensitive skin that breaks out VERY easily. All of the other kinds of cream/moisturizers like this that I have tried made me break out. This one does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am obsessed with this brand. And you will be too! In my opinion, worth EVERY penny. I am going to buy the larger size when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> Regular routine lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product at a skin care day spa.  I love the way it feels and smells.  When I was getting low, I checked Amazon to see if I could purchase it online, and low and behold, it was cheaper than what I had paid originally!!  It was delivered promptly and is the exact same product.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great night moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My favorite facial cream.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious and works! My skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> I was so afraid to order this off amazon but I&#x27;m sooooo happy I did. I couldn&#x27;t find a single spa that carried this anywhere around Tampa. I have very very sensitive combination skin and my skin LOVES this product and my skin looks so healthy now. Thank God I was able to order this from amazon!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite face cremes.  Recommended by the lady I get facials from.  Wish it had a version for summer with a higher SPF.</li>
    <li> This is an essential skin care ingredient for me that I normally get at my dermatologist&#x27;s office. Happy to know I can order it online!</li>
    <li> I love my Vital C cream and use it every night.  It is a wonderful product and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C is good for your skin. I&#x27;ve using this product line for 6 years! I highly recommend this and the other products in this line.</li>
    <li> Been using and buying elsewhere for about 3x the price... AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME.....really works and smells heavenly.  Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Along with the hydrating cleanser,  this moisturizer works great.  Not greasy,  sinks right into my skin. Use it at night.</li>
    <li> Image doesn&#x27;t sell online. Only through professionals! Keep that in mind before you waste money on this junk.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible that there&#x27;s people out there who still want to make money off others by selling them crap that not only doesn&#x27;t work but damages the skin you have now.</li>
    <li> Excellent Cream, this is the second time I purchase this brand and i am very happy with the purchase. Need one more.</li>
    <li> Just as I expected a wonderful product at a reasonable price.  I would highly recommend this product it makes your skin feel great!</li>
    <li> I really like Vital C.  It feels so good on your skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years now.</li>
    <li> Even my 13 year old daughter uses it and she skin is looking better. I mix the types up to achieve the right combo for us. My skin has never been so evenly hydrated and I live in DRY colorado.</li>
    <li> Love this crème.  It&#x27;s light and love the smell of oranges.  Leaves your skin glowing and soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent ingredients and the best for sensitive skin. This product is reasonably priced for the quality of ingredients it contains. The creme also goes a long way. Smells of citrus.</li>
    <li> I am 76 and have been using this product for several years, it keeps my skin moist and clear.  Many people ask what I do to&lt;br /&gt;keep my skin looking young.</li>
    <li> I have used the Image Skincare line for several years. This product is wonderful!  It feels light on my skin and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> Product smells great.  I used to purchase this at my salon and this product is no different in consistency or efficacy.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizer but not as good as the serum, and you have to use a lot to get results.  Make no mistake, I like this but I like the serum better. I have mature dry skin, but a younger person might have better results.</li>
    <li> I use this day and night and love it.  My skin runs a little dry and this works well for me.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!! And Works amazing. Is helping my acne as well. anyone should try this cream. I use this cream only at night.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the ingredients listed.  I was looking for an anhydrous vit C cream with 20% vit C.  The product I received looks like the same packaging but has a totally different ingredient list, and lists water as the first ingredient.  I will be sending my entire purchase back.  Wish me luck on getting a refund, I ordered 5 of these for my sisters and 5 facial cleansers which also has an entirely different ingredient list!!!!! I&#x27;m super mad.</li>
    <li> Smells as good as it feels. Moisturizes without being heavy or greasy. Been using it for a few years &amp; love it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin that gets oily to compensate which ultimately causes horrible breakouts. I needed something that was moisturizing enough to stop the excess oil production while not clogging my pores. I was told to use this after a facial I had done. I cringed at the $60 price tag but was desperate to find something that would work for me. Thankfully this product did the trick (and I found it for 1/3 of the price on Amazon) Happy face, happy wallet, happy girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also to note from reviewers posting that the products they received aren&#x27;t the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34;, the product I received was 100% authentic and exactly the same thing that I bought from the esthetician.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - my skincare person turned me onto it!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! Will never be without! Only thing that keeps my skin from break outs and truly moisturized!!! It also came very quickly through the mail and packaged very well. Thank You!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
    <li> you can feel the tingles of the vitamin C in this product.  It smells awesome, fresh, citrisy.  Nice cream on the thicker side, goes on well.  I put it on at bedtime and it&#x27;s like aromatherapy.</li>
    <li> I love this cream non greasy, and really hydrates my sking, and works well under makeup, will buy again for sure</li>
    <li> I love this product,  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It literally makes my skin glow. I get lots of compliments on my skin and love to tell my age. It makes my skin so soft and the product smells great.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this. It brightens my skin, it&#x27;s light, and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I use it at night and it works great.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product! So thankful someone recommended it to me.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product.  Not greasy and provides wonderful moisture for our dry CO climate.  I have used this product for a few years and will continue.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer and don&#x27;t break out with ingredients. I have ultra sensitive skin and this product is perfect and light.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with dryness of the eyelid. I put this product on thinly and wow it works great. Now it is a favorite product for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this crème before and I just love it. It refreshes and is clean.&lt;br /&gt;I will always use it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have only used fpor a few weeks and can already see the difference.  My face is loving this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Smells like Vitamin C - fresh and citrusy!  YUM!  LOVE This stuff!!!! It works well and is not greasy - so perfect.</li>
    <li> Contains good level of vitamin C, is not too heavy with very mild citrus scent.  This came highly recommended from my skin care specialist.</li>
    <li> This feels amazing on your skin and smells amazing too.  Love everything I have tried from this company.</li>
    <li> What I was looking for</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and my husband has beautiful normal skin and this works great on both of us..It is not greasy..We use it as night cream bc it does NOT have SPF but it&#x27;s ok bc we already have another SPF moisturizer we use for during the day..I highly recommend it...</li>
    <li> This works the best for me of all the ones I have tried.</li>
    <li> My go to moisturizer! I use it morning and night. Leaves skin hydrated and not greasy!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product, and would recommend it to anyone......E.Ulinsky</li>
    <li> Good price, too, for a fantastic product. My esthetician sells it for $58.00 in her shop so I feel that by buying it here on Amazon,  I can use it more liberally. It smells of oranges and feels SO good on my old skin. Has done wonders.</li>
    <li> I love this Image face creme. The first time I got it in a salon that sells Image products, but then decided to try and buy it on Amazon. It came pretty fast, in a good condition, all ingredients are the same like in the previous creme and smells exactly the same. The only difference - I got it cheaper on Amazon! I&#x27;m really happy!</li>
    <li> A wonderful product!!! LOVE it!!! Very soothing for rosacea, LOVE the whole line of products!!!&lt;br /&gt;Packaged well and very prompt!!</li>
    <li> I use &amp;#34;IMAGE&amp;#34; products because the Professional Skin Therapist I go to recommends these.  She uses these on her clients and also sells these products in her shop.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with the order &amp; shipment experience going thru AMAZON.COM for these purchases.</li>
    <li> Irritates near eyes smells great</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I use both after cleansing in the a.m. and evening.  Not greasy or heavy feeling.</li>
    <li> My girl that I have facials with once a month uses thee products on me but her prices were more than I could pay so I found this</li>
    <li> This creme truly does remove wrinkles...and smells like oranges.  Very light, I love it.</li>
    <li> Great smell and feel.  It goes on smoothly and really absorbs into your skin with no greasy feeling  Love it!</li>
    <li> Since when is it fair to have wrinkles and acne????  I thought by 45 I would be done with annoying breakouts!  But, no!  I deal with both!  I was given a sample of this Orange scented cream from our medical spa and I fell in love with THIS and the minty acne medicated lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way this product smells and it feels refreshing and light!  I wear it during the day and I have noticed my patchy skin has lightened and my acne occurs less often!  In fact, I asked for it for my birthday in February, and a month later I noticed that my skin had been clear for 2 weeks!  I barely use a finger dot of it every day, and it is lasting a long time.  Sometimes, I use my less expensive daily moisturizer and I find it is good for my skin to use different products.</li>
    <li> The citrus smell is what hits you first but the product is very good. Rich, thick and makes your skin feel moisturized. Hard to just use it at night</li>
    <li> It is for my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, I am 60 and have used it everyday for three years and my skin looks wonderful.</li>
    <li> I use other products in this line of moisturizer so I decided to try the night repair creme. So far I have been very pleased with the results. It smells great too., like fresh squeezed oranges.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer and used jars of it. It is a littler heavier but, I wanted it to be. The scent is fresh citrusy. There isn&#x27;t anything I don&#x27;t like about it.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, isn&#x27;t greasy, love it.  The Peter Thomas Roth is good, but this is better.  Smooth, soft, light, easy</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product for dry skin. GREAT smell!</li>
    <li> My Esthetician started me on the Image Vital C products and all of them are great, but I especially love this one. I use this at night alternating with the Anti-aging cream with the grey label. I love the way this cream feels on my skin, the way it smells, and the way it makes my skin feel. It&#x27;s very emollient, but not greasy feeling in any way. I have been using these products for over a year, am 47 years old, and my skin looks great. So much so, that I stopped wearing heavy foundation and use B.B. cream only.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea, so I was worried about this product.  To my surprise, it is nourishing, gentle and leaves my skin feeling wonderfly soft!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I too purchased this product after getting a sample at the spa I went to.  I love it!!! It hydrates without being greasy and without causing breakouts.  I am 53 years old and was concerned about my overall skin texture.  This amazing creme has completely eliminated the \\&quot;crepey\\&quot; skin on my neck.  It is now taut and smooth, I really didn&#x27;t expect that.  Even when I skip a day my skin stays smooth and firm.  I love the Image line of products and this is definitely one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I love this hydrating cream, it makes my skin feel great.:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 57 years old, and this repair cream (and the companion daily cleanser) are the ONLY products I&#x27;ve tried over the course of MANY years that truly make small, visible lines around my eyes and mouth disappear within days. I&#x27;ve even started using the repair cream on my hands ... and it makes a remarkable difference there, as well. The repair cream and daily cleanser now are among my beauty staples. Definitely recommend to young and mature women, alike.</li>
    <li> Wonder for my face and neck..I can apply it and with in seconds I can feel it tighten while moisturizing at the same time..I plan to keep this product on my shelf !</li>
    <li> Love the hydrating repari creme. I use it at night feels wonderful when putting it on my face. Would recommend</li>
    <li> BEWARE!!! BEWARE!!!&lt;br /&gt;I checked the website of Image Skin Care and it is not their policy to sell on the internet.  You can only find these in a dermatology clinic and from licensed estheticians... Thank God I checked the website.</li>
    <li> My second order. I see improvement with this product.</li>
    <li> Super product - purchased one after the facial and got hooked on it. Best price found on AMAZON.COM!!!! The ones who are complaining are only unhappy because they can&#x27;t keep the price and profit really high.... I will continue to buy through Amazon.com like many other satisfied customers!</li>
    <li> I first learned about Image products through my facial lady....I am very happy with the Image products that&lt;br /&gt;I use. I plan on continuing their use and will expand to other products as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best Vitamin C product I have found I have used it now for over two years and it is great.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I have not had to use my metrogel creme for my rosacea this takes care of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;my skin has never looked better.  I love the orange smell!</li>
    <li> I have been using Image products for the last 3 years and I can REALLY see a difference. My skin was prone to bumps for years and when I went to dermatologist (actually two different ones) I was told it was  perioral dermatitis and couldn&#x27;t suggest anything, that it might be hormonal. After a professional facial the ethnitician she got me started on this entire line of Vital C. My face has never looked better! I will continue to use the cleanser, serum, hydrating cream, eye cream and masque as long as it is sold. I&#x27;m 58 and on an outing with my 30 year old daughter, two separate people thought we were sisters. I hope they meant it because it was very flattering!</li>
    <li> I swear by these products and so does my esthetician.  Mature skin will thank you every time!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vital C for over a year now.  I just saw my sister for the first time in several months and she complimented me on my youthful face and demanded to know what I was using.  of course I was willing to share :)</li>
    <li> Amazing for aging/oily skin.  I wake up looking refreshed and glowing.  Compliments on my skin constantly and I always hated my skins texture!</li>
    <li> I use this at night with my Image Hyaluronic Fill.  It is nice and rich and goes on smoothly plus has a nice light orangy fragrance.  I think that using it with the Hyaluronic Filler really make a difference in my wrinkles and tightens up my skin on my face.  I feel like I am looking younger every day.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> use every night and love the feel on my face.  not heavy at all.</li>
    <li> I like this brand of cosmetics.</li>
    <li> This Hydrating Creme smells great and goes on the skin nicely. I use it in combination with a few other products and it gets soaked into the skin for a moisturized feeling without being greasy. I&#x27;ve noticed that it seems to help with the deeper laugh lines around my mouth.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and have used for years !!!!</li>
    <li> love this...its amazing.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, service and delivery. Very pleased! Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing line...  It hydrates like not much else and is worth the money.  You will not regret the purchase because I have found nothing that hydrates as well.</li>
    <li> I would and have told everyone about this stuff!! I have noticed a difference in my skin after a week of using it. The product arrived so fast I was shocked...dark spots are fading fast. This is a must try</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different face creams over the years, and this one is definitely different. I&#x27;ve only used it about five nights now but I wake up with the prettiest skin. I have a pale complexion so it tends to redden easily and I have some faint rosacea from the cold weather where I live. Everything I read online said nothing but lasers could make the capillaries less visible, although some people said a cream with vitamin C could work. I was skeptical but I&#x27;m either hallucinating or this makes a real difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly buy this again. Can&#x27;t imagine going back to other creams. FYI, I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles or acne so I have no idea what it does for those, but this doesn&#x27;t make me break out like some other lotions &amp; potions do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the controversy some reviewers are posting regarding whether this is a legal or full version of the product.  It seems like the real deal that I paid twice as much for from a boutique. The smell and feel are phenomenal.  I have sensitive skin and this produce has yet to cause me any breakouts. I have been using it morning and evening.  My skin feels hydrated, but not greasy. And once again - not breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It is the best I have found. It leaves your skin very soft all through the night and feels like silk in the morning. I get European facials and my spa uses it.</li>
    <li> My mom was looking all over for this product and she absolutely LOVES this product!</li>
    <li> The scent is not good. My husband always complains when I put it on my face at night. I really do not see any results this face cream is doing for my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a while and just love it!</li>
    <li> The best night cream. Super moist. The smell is delicious!</li>
    <li> This is ok, but it did make my face break out. I went back to Dermalogica products skin smoothing cream! So glad I did my face is back to smooth and refreshed! Love Dermalogica!</li>
    <li> Love Image Skincare. I&#x27;ve used it for years, never had a problem with any of their lines.</li>
    <li> Great product have purchased it numerous times.</li>
    <li> Love the texture, feel and slight ting-y feeling I get from this. My friend, who is older than me, looks younger than me and she uses it all the time. The moisture feeling, or coating I get from this lasts even after I shower the next morning. I do not notice it clogging my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was shipped sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> Fantastic products. Not greasy at all and doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling oily.  This smells fantastic tool The entire product line is really great.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have sensitive skin and it has never bother me. I use all the image c products and love them all.</li>
    <li> If you use it daily and apply a thick amount, then it will get rid of wrinkles! I think its a great product even for the price.</li>
    <li> Used for a couple years now; tried others and keep coming back to it.  It is hydrating and great for rosacea.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend buys it every year and loves it very much. She looks younger as her age  so it is working, I think.</li>
    <li> wesome. Love it, great cleanser and face wash trusted name brand and product I totally recommend it to face washers</li>
    <li> great skin care product</li>
    <li> light and goes on non greasy. absorbs well adn you can feel it working... smells good too. i would recommend it highly.. my daughter is an ectician and she highly recommends it as well</li>
    <li> Great cream and works amazingly</li>
    <li> love this product in conjunction with Vital C. I&#x27;ve been using for years, found for less on line (as opposed to my salons prices) so I will continue to purchase for slightly less on line.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping...product perfect...</li>
    <li> Came quickly.  Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love it. Great price- new</li>
    <li> Excellent .does diminish red scaly spots on the face but without continuing use the redness does return</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for extremely sensitive skin. Leaves your skin well hydrated without any greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> This has absolutey SAVED my skin! And by saved, I mean I used to use St. Ives Apricot Scrub twice a day, had really dry flaky skin and the &#x27;angry&#x27; irritated rosacea on my cheeks that made me look like Pikachu. I have used this religiously every day since I first tried this as a sample and cannot sing enough praises about it! My rosacea is at a tolerable faint redness that can be covered with makeup and my skin is finally hydrated, smooth and repaired without having any worry about breaking out using oily, greasy moisturizers. It lasts forever because a little goes a long way, especially after leaving a very light film of water on my face-- it helps it spread more easily and save product. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer to wear under makeup, too, not just for night time. Woop wooooop!</li>
    <li> In combination with the cleanser, this makes for the perfect routine.  Keeps my skin moisturized, but not oily. I use it mainly at bedtime, but will also use if under makeup when it snows or is really cold outside, as a protective barrier.  My husband uses it too!</li>
    <li> I love this vital C cream</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a year now and I love it.  It&#x27;s non greasy and lasts all day leaving your skin feeling fresh! Seller shipped quick!</li>
    <li> I have normal to dry skin and I recently started getting microdermabrasion so my skin was dryer than usual. I am very sensitive to ingredients so Icant use most lotions but this is amazing. It has never broken me out and hydrates without being greasy. It lasts for a long time because you only need a little bit. I use it under my makeup sometimes if I&#x27;m dry but usually just at night and Iwake up with amazing soft skin</li>
    <li> What I love about this moisturize is how a little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s very hydrating and nourishing - you can feel it!  But if you use too much your face may look too shiny or oily.  Other than that, I love Image&#x27;s &amp;#34;Vital C&amp;#34; product line.</li>
    <li> This is a great repair creme and it&#x27;s moisturizing without being greasy.  I use it every night. I love all of the Image Skin Care Vitamin C products that I have purchased.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years.  I am over 50 and whenever I use another moisturizer I am deeply disappointed.  I love this crème.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely product, it smells citrusy and goes on smoothly leaving no greasiness.  I use it at night and it takes the redness out of my skin and leaves it very soft.  I would use it in the daytimes as well, but it has no sunscreen.  I&#x27;m 68 and need lots of moisture, this works.</li>
    <li> I actually use many of the Image Skincare products because I just LOVE this line! This particular creme does what it says. It is super-hydrating. I would say perfect for use in the winter when skin is dryer or if you live in a place like Las Vegas or places where the climate has little humidity. I use the Vital C Cleanser in combination with the creme. It smells GREAT! Works GREAT! I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> My favorite cream for the day. It is not greasy and it gives me a great foundation for the makeup.</li>
    <li> I use this cream on the recommendation of the gal who does facials, etc., for me, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s doing the best it can!!!</li>
    <li> I am surprised to see Image Skin Care available on here! This is a very active skin care line and MUST be monitored by a skin care specialist or doctor!! If you have a reaction, who are you going to call here on Amazon???</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Is thick and moisturizing and has a great citrus scent that doesn&#x27;t smell too chemically like other lotions do.  Shipped fast and well packaged!</li>
    <li> Love this product, continue to reorder as needed</li>
    <li> The Image Skin Care line is one of the best I have ever used. It is like my skin doctor&lt;br /&gt;said Less is More. That is important. I use only three products. Cleanser, moisturizer with&lt;br /&gt;SPF and the vital C. Amazing products!</li>
    <li> Image is a great skincare company. Reasonable for the results. I have used this product for a year and have seen great result of better looking less wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this lotion.  My daughter in law gave it to me for Christmas and I&#x27;m now on my second jar.</li>
    <li> This is not the real image.</li>
    <li> I like the light citrus scent and leaves my face feeling silky.  Even with my semi-oily skin, it&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
    <li> I love this line of products! I have fair, sensitive skin that is still prone to break outs in my late 30&#x27;s. My skin feels wonderful after I use this product snd stays that way all day- even if I only apply it at night and forget on the morning. Perfect for this busy mama!</li>
    <li> Excellent service and customer care.&lt;br /&gt;Backs the authenticity of their products.&lt;br /&gt;Will be back for more product.&lt;br /&gt;Jan P.</li>
    <li> Non greasy. My skin loves this refreshing drink of vitamin C.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It makes my face feel really smooth.</li>
    <li> My skin just soaks it up. Good price!</li>
    <li> Images Hydrating Repair Creme is a light cream&lt;br /&gt;that has changed my skin to look younger and feel&lt;br /&gt;really good.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this on her face, and the price on Amazon is 40% lower than she was being charged by her dermatologist.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Great product. Hydrates without leaving my skin greasy.  Delivered on time &amp; in great shape</li>
    <li> I have been paying double the cost that I got from this company.  Thanks for offering it at a affordable price:)</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a few years. It&#x27;s a wonderful face cream for night a d under makeup. Light yet effective.</li>
    <li> I have this weird thing with my facial skin where sometimes when the seasons change, my skin will get red and dry on my nose and often along the edges of my hair line.  I don&#x27;t know why, and I have done what was suggested, but this Vitamin C stuff was definitely the missing link.  Now when the redness appears it is a verrry short amount of time, down from a month to a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The craziest thing is that I have had these skin issues for years now, and since I go this stuff, I have gotten like 6 compliments on nice my skin is hahaha.  It seriously makes me feel super sexy ;)  And I&#x27;m a guy.</li>
    <li> Just love this cream. Usually I wont pay the price but but this makes my face feel wonderful! just need a little.</li>
    <li> Love this, smells and feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer of all time.</li>
    <li> Full of antioxidants that combat free radicals. Cheaper at CorePower yoga and spa locations in MN.&lt;br /&gt;Go to a licensed professional to find out what is right for your specific skin type</li>
    <li> I tried this product after using others by the same brand.  I really like the way this product works.  It goes on nicely and does not have an oily feel to it.  My skin really looks very refreshed the next day. When used with the vitamin c serum, there is an added boost to the skin.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of it and is works very well. Keeps my face hydrated, but not too much to make it oily.</li>
    <li> my skin looked brighter just after 3 nights, get it :)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, truly a skin care junkie and this is the best</li>
    <li> I no longer have issues with combination skin, Image Vital C Hyrdrating Repair Creme has made all the difference.  I&#x27;ve used Vital C eye recovery gel and anti-aging serum along with the repair creme.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with all three products.</li>
    <li> great for winter time.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect moisturizer.  I use it along with Bio Peptide Crème.  The smell is heavenly.  Not too heavy, just right.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for hydrating normal to combo skin.  No parabens or other unsavory ingredients.  Would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This cream makes my skin look and feel hydrated, even in the dry, new engand winter environment. I believe it helps reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It has a lightweight consistency and does not cause breakouts on my easy to clog pores. Love the citrus fragrance as well. My esthetician uses this and recommended it highly. Will reorder as I love it!</li>
    <li> So far I love this skin cream for my sensitive skin! My dermatologist recommended the sunscreen/moisturizer from this line so I figured I would also try this for night time. I love both products! My skin tolerates it well and I feel that my skin is looking brighter and more youthful (I am 35). The price is great and I plan on continuing with this product for the long haul.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a while now and I really do love it. It feels and smells great, and it has really made a difference with my skin. I&#x27;m so happy I found it.</li>
    <li> Very glad to find this wonderful cream, as my esthetician has stopped carrying it. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to cover my face, so it lasts a long time.  I love it! I use it at night only, though.  You have to be careful using Vitamin C because of increased likelihood of sunburn and damage from the sun.</li>
