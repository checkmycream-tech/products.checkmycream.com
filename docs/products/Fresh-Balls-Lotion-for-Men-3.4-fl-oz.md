      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>I liked it.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s not like it kind of works for  a while</li>
      <li>This stuff is just awesome, goes on as a lotion and dries fast into a powder.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, feels good, and who doesn&#x27;t want to have FRESH BALLS!!</li>
      <li>Many thanks for a great product!</li>
      <li>Honestly, you&#x27;re better off with powder.</li>
      <li>it sounds too good to be true because it is</li>
      <li>He says it works fabulously!</li>
      <li>looked at the bottle closer and found out something interesting.</li>
      <li>I would gladly recommend this product to ever make out there.</li>
      <li>sure there are better options.</li>
      <li>What more needs to be said?</li>
      <li>Way better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Just ok....</li>
      <li>I read the reviews, but still wasn&#x27;t sure this would work.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I can&#x27;t mention here.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using powder for MANY years, my wife even giving me a \\&quot;powder puff\\&quot; to apply the powder under scrotum, etc.</li>
      <li>Out of all the products I&#x27;ve tried, this one works, but just ok.</li>
      <li>The downside, as the directions say, make sure you wash your hands WELL.</li>
      <li>Much better than any competing sports powder on the market.</li>
      <li>They also thought it was hilarious.</li>
      <li>I just like the goldbond powder better.</li>
      <li>From EVERYONE. :-)</li>
      <li>I truly am able to get to sleep faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Definitely not a value for the money but a wonderful gag gift.</li>
      <li>More than helping with the smell (which it helps alot with)</li>
      <li>Powder is better.</li>
      <li>Or they renamed the product to be more \\&quot;edgy\\&quot; as a marketing ploy.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend also plays with them more often and isn&#x27;t as grossed out, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
      <li>, becomes what I most desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Better off buying baby powder at the dollar store.</li>
      <li>, sure hope it works.</li>
      <li>The &#x27;ol yamsacks smelled pretty good for a couple of hours, but I seemed to be sweatier in the crotchal region more so than without the product.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for long days with tons of walking.</li>
      <li>I had used Gold Bond Fresh Spray before and that seems more effective.  </li>
      <li>First of all I saw this product on TV during an episode of &amp;#34;Shark Tank&amp;#34; it sounded like a great idea since I love to be fresh in that area.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure it&#x27;s the recommended 9&amp;#34; or so away when you spray and you should be fine.</li>
      <li>so I decided to try this razor along with MAX Shave and together they really clean all the hair off, balls and all!</li>
      <li>People now wonder why a guy with a crew cut has a blow dryer, but I&#x27;ve never been more comfortable.</li>
      <li>Hopping out of the shower and lightly spreading this mixture of my underthings is one of the things I look forward to most each day.</li>
      <li>It is more comfortable as the day goes than lubricant sticks.</li>
      <li>Thiso is a good product works very well.</li>
      <li>No mess and smells great.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> ......It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m rubbing nothing on my private parts. It certainly does not work as the product claims. Maybe I got a bad batch or something but I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks yet It doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping the smell.</li>
    <li> Keeps balls fresh and dry, but leaves residue on your hands that you immediately have to wash off.</li>
    <li> Works great when applied as directed.  Makes a great stocking stuffer for the guys in your life who have a bit of an obsession with male genitalia.  Which is pretty much every guy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! No more clandestine adjustments or waddle steps mid-stride. I&#x27;ve even gone as far as to gift one to a co-worker and exhort others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro-tip: Get a hair-drier with the trigger that blows cool air. People now wonder why a guy with a crew cut has a blow dryer, but I&#x27;ve never been more comfortable.</li>
    <li> I have fresh ball again</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! If you have sweaty guy crotch, this is the product  to use . I wish I would have discovered this years ago: keeps you fresh !</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother. He had been using Gold Bond powder on his boys but it wasn&#x27;t quite doing the job. Upon receiving the package, his first comment was, \\&quot;Fresh Balls Day 1 - not grasping how a liquid gonna keep me dry? Instructions say it turns into a silky powder but really gotta work it in.... at that point, I&#x27;m pretty much masturbating and I doubt Fresh Balls can absorb that mess.\\&quot;  He then asked f Fresh Balls can be used near anus . .  On July 4th, my brother spent a considerable amount of time in a swimming pool. He reported that his balls were indeed dry after swimming but they didn&#x27;t smell quite so fresh...  He proclaimed with joy, \\&quot;S*** really works!\\&quot;  In conclusion, even with the thick, summer humidity of New Jersey combined with hours in a swimming pool, this product will indeed keep balls dry.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. :)</li>
    <li> Fresh, clean, dry balls all day!</li>
    <li> its a good product but you could get the same thing from gold bonds</li>
    <li> It works pretty okay. It&#x27;s not great but it does control most of the sweat I get down there. I wish it lasted longer though. For the first few hours I&#x27;m fine, but by lunch time it just becomes a white blotchy powdery mess down there.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a joke at first, but love gag gifts anyway. When I learned it really is what it says, well I had to gag gift the hubby for Christmas with it. He hasn&#x27;t tried it yet but plans to. It does have a pleasant fragrance and if it works as it&#x27;s supposed to I will increase the star rating. For now I would really give it a 2 or 3. But am giving it a 4 just in case it really works. Hoping it will, hey men need things like this too and powders can be messy. So we will see. The name is just too funny, sure hope it works.</li>
    <li> I just received my SIXTH order for Fresh Balls this YEAR! Can&#x27;t live without it! A 2-pack. This stuff works SO incredibly well, and each 3 ounce bottle lasts a little longer than a month. I just ordered the 5 ounce bottle for the less money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on like a lotion, and when it dries it works like powder, except you don&#x27;t have the mess that powder leaves. I&#x27;ve been using powder for MANY years, my wife even giving me a \\&quot;powder puff\\&quot; to apply the powder under scrotum, etc. Obviously, the powder goes into the air and lands everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Fresh Balls, I dry the area very well, to start, often even using a hair blow dryer. I take about a dime size amount and rub it on the left side of my scrotum. Rub another dime size on the left side. Rub a nickel size amount underneath, and a little on the \\&quot;top\\&quot; where my penis might hang. I don&#x27;t want to put any directly on the shaft in case my wife and I get intimate later that day and it happens to go in her mouth. Finally, I put some underneath my scrotum, at the top and between my legs, where the legs touch together. Basically, any where I feel that sweaty feeling throughout the day. I get dressed immediately after application. The lotion dries in a few minutes (yes, at first it was uncomfortable with wetness where I wanted it dry, but as I said, it dries quickly). I am sweat free ALL DAY LONG. This stuff is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No powder mess. No need for re-application. Best of all: it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important note:: The bottles are changing colors to blue and orange versus the old black and grey.. Their website implies that this new color is legitimate. I was worried because of another review. But no, it works even better though ingredients have changed ever so slightly, a different color tube and BIGGER size available!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff still works great...</li>
    <li> What did you do to this product, when it was in the silver tubes it was the business. Now... what did you do. it&#x27;s like facebook, you took a perfectly good product and change it for no reason.&lt;br /&gt;Crap product stayed sticky once applied.&lt;br /&gt;I would continue to rant, but my gentleman bits are very angry with me, so I need to go and make it up to them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - after emailing them on their website - the sent me one tube free - this stuff they sent does work, and they said they had a bad batch &#x27;out there&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So they have kept the same formula</li>
    <li> I was a little underwhelmed with this. It wasn&#x27;t bad, but it had been so positively reviewed that I was expecting more noticeable dryness, which I didn&#x27;t really experience. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s THAT much better than Gold Bond powder, and certainly not worth the etra cost.</li>
    <li> Good idea, but not as described. Kinda makes a paste even though it says it&#x27;s supposed to keep you dry.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully. Completely dry, however, make sure you wash your hands afterwards because it dries as a powder even though it goes on as a cream.</li>
    <li> Perfect. No mess and smells great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok if you&#x27;re just laying around the house all day, but it&#x27;s not even close to the smooth, dry feel of the Balla Powder. I thought initially the powder would not be as easy to apply and would be messier, but I was wrong. You apply with your palm anyway.</li>
    <li> Okay, considering the only other option is powder that gets all over the bathroom, your clothes and floor, this stuff is awesome! If your most manly area is chaffed, reddened or smells like a gym locker past it&#x27;s freshness date this is the stuff for you. I had a tender area due to perspiration, I&#x27;m now healed and back on the excercise bike. ignore other reviews talking about this product being messy. Shaker powders are uncontrollable and messy, NOT THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Having tried more than a few products over the past 40 years that claim to eliminate chafing, sticking and discomfort below the belt but fall short,Fresh Balls finally does the job....Second year using it for me, and several co-workers have been very satisfied with their Fresh Balls experiences.....Hot and humid summer days on the jobsite are easier to deal with thanks to this product.....It Works</li>
    <li> Terrible, just doesn&#x27;t work.  Makes things sticky.  Might prevent excessive sweating in the summer, but no defense against stickiness.  In fact, makes it way stickier.  I keep my business shaved so that may have something to do with it.  But it&#x27;s not like it kind of works for  a while, it just PLAIN DOESN&#x27;T WORK!  Don&#x27;t waste your money, buy a bottle of baby powder and be good for a year for $3.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts when ordering this product, but I am definitely glad that I did! More than helping with the smell (which it helps alot with) it helped with the sticky balls problem that always forced me to awkwardly lift my balls up or walk funny to unstick them. Will definitely buying more once I run out. My girlfriend also plays with them more often and isn&#x27;t as grossed out, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> This is very good and works like a charm. I am a very stinky man down there and one application of this in the morning is all I need for the day. But, wear gloves or something because it is just annoying to get it all on your hands. I just have to remember to do this last after I put my body lotion and face lotion on lol.</li>
    <li> Product is now part of my daily hygiene regime! The cooling sensation does wonders, mess-free, easy to apply, &amp; keeps heavy sweaters (like myself) feeling good all day.</li>
    <li> I have the freshest balls in town. No more skunky sack for me!</li>
    <li> I found this product while living in the hot AZ summers. Keeps your stuff fresh. Dries quick for daily use.</li>
    <li> It works and no powder flying around the room making a mess actually I think it works better than regular talcum powder. I am a clean freak at least two showers a day and more when it is hot this product may allow me to skip a shower, well maybe.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  Causes mild burning sensation on groin area.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Helps with the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; down there after a hard day of work. One bottle lasted me about 3 mos.</li>
    <li> Although the product name may sound humorous, it works exactly as it should. I no longer suffer from terrible SWEATY BALLS and instead remain fresh and dry all day long. The cream smells like a fresh load of laundry, but isn&#x27;t overpowering like you just dipped your tea bag into a flower bed. Overall, I plan on using this for as long as I have balls, which I hope to have them for the rest of my lifetime.</li>
    <li> This is the first product I have tried to lessen the &amp;#34;swamp&amp;#34; nastiness that happens on warm humid days while wearing a thick uniform. And I have to say it does what it says while supposedly not using any female hormones.</li>
    <li> I found this product to work alright. My main concern is in regards to men who are sexually active. My girlfriend at times complained when I would use this product.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it ! He used to use Gold Bond for those less than comfortable warm days until he tried this product!</li>
    <li> Being hairy and well endowed,living here in the South,we sweat.I was using cornstarch until I discovered this excellent product. I goes on smooth with little residue.I sleep in the \\&quot;bear\\&quot; and there is no staining of the sheets,also since I do not wear underwear,there is no staining of the shorts and/or pants. A good buy.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this product works well enough. It keeps you fairly dry and does prevent chafing. It keeps you fairly comfortable. The only down side is you need to wait until it completely dries, or you will get a white powder all over. Which normally ist a problem but could if you had a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a 100% but it makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~EDIT~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the bottle closer and found out something interesting. This is not \\&quot;Fresh Balls\\&quot; there was a sticker that said fresh balls on it, but if you remove that sticker, it says Fresh Male under it. Now, I don&#x27;t know if this is another product all together, if this is an old package that was re-labeled or a complete counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible that another company bought out Fresh Male and repackaged it under their own brand. Or they renamed the product to be more \\&quot;edgy\\&quot; as a marketing ploy. Or they had a similar product and was trying to jump on the advertising that Fresh Balls put out. I originally heard about \\&quot;Fresh Balls\\&quot; on Opie and Anthony (a national radio program) And decided to buy this one because it was cheaper. But now I feel as I was duped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with that said, I still stand by my 4 star rating as far as the product doing what it&#x27;s supposed to. But the fact that it may not be what I wanted it to be I will give it 1.5 because it&#x27;s might not be the brand that I thought I was buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller, a response would be appreciated</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, works great, keeps me feeling fresh and smelling great. I would recommend this product for any guy.</li>
    <li> The name says it all. Use it for both work days and sports/exercise days. The downside, as the directions say, make sure you wash your hands WELL. The liquid can sometimes get caught around your finger nail cuticle creating a mess.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance and he said it works wonder for him</li>
    <li> Yup, his balls are fresh!</li>
    <li> The product seems to be working.  I haven&#x27;t put it up against Gold Bond spray yet, but no bat wings today so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a huge fan of the smell because it smells a bit girly like a cucumber in my pants.. Hey is that a cucumber in your pants?  No really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it seems to be working as advertised, but I will edit my review after I go for a motorcycle ride in 90F 90% humidity weather.  That&#x27;s the test of taint abrasion that I am waiting for.  The item I received today (summer 2015) is the gray bottle as shown, so I was happy that I got the right product and not a generic replacement that has been mentioned in older reviews.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Words can&#x27;t describe the relief of large thighs and big balls. This stuff smells great all day. Now granted I don&#x27;t work construction all day anymore but regardless of the fact, we all suffer from sweaty nuts in the wRmer months. Fresh balls was the answer for me. Many thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> Works as well as the old silver tubed version. Great fragrance, slightly spicy. Does as it says. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> not sure how to review this but it does work. if you get sweaty down there, use this stuff. it does work.</li>
    <li> It keeps you dry and comfortable with no powder everywhere. What more needs to be said?</li>
    <li> Basically this doesn&#x27;t work well.  I had used Gold Bond Fresh Spray before and that seems more effective.  Fresh balls just doesn&#x27;t seem to keep &#x27;em that fresh.</li>
    <li> And big guys have some issues with heat. C&#x27;mon guys, you know it.  This stuff is awesome. It goes on like a lotion, then turns to a powder.&lt;br /&gt;No chafing, no irritation. I wish it had a little pleasant &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; odor to it, but it&#x27;s essentially odorless.  In any event, it&#x27;s a great solution for those super-hot-n-humid days you have to mow the lawn, or walk around a lot or whatever. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> No one likes some funky schweaty balls. This helps, and my dude swears by it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried two tubes of this product and I have to say it works, but not for a long time. I&#x27;d say you get about 4-5 hours of stick-free enjoyment. But I&#x27;m going back to generic body powder as I&#x27;ve done more research and Talc isn&#x27;t the carcinogenic property others have made it out to be.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on the documentary, Mansome. At first I could do nothing but laugh about why someone would go though the effort of creating a product like this. Then it dawned on me one morning as I stood there pouring a cloud of powder down by boxers and all over my junk why this stuff was developed. After a year of hemming and hawing back and forth and suffering much ridicule from my better half about wanting to order this stuff I finally took the leap. Let this be said about Fresh Balls, the guy that created this stuff is a genius. I&#x27;ve been living in a cloud of Gold Bond powder since I first learned the importance of keeping the boys dry as an awkward teenager. No more white powder clouds again. This stuff is just awesome, goes on as a lotion and dries fast into a powder. Doesn&#x27;t have the medicated scent of Gold Bond, doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;balls of fire&amp;#34; sensation of Gold Bond and doesn&#x27;t leave a powder mess everywhere. And best of all, it really does keep the boys dry all day long. Hour on a treadmill at the gym and this stuff holds up, I may be drenched in sweat all over but the boys are dry and no chafing. Best product for the family jewels</li>
    <li> Here is the deal on Fresh Balls.  I am a &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; guy.  Bat Wings are the standard for me OR should I say was the standard.  This stuff is amazing. It took a few applications to get it right but now I can&#x27;t say enough good things.  What I will tell you is it will keep you dry and smelling nice but do not apply in the crease of the groin unless you can keep your legs spread until everything is dry and even then you can still get some moisture. Trust me give this stuff a try and you will be sold.</li>
    <li> If you want the best stuff to put on your balls, this is it, your partner will truly love the fact that you have really fresh balls!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it does, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine going back to any of the powders out there. Very happy with the product. The only reason I am writing this review, in fact, is because I needed to reorder and it gave me a reminder to write a review. Easy 5 Stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past week. I don&#x27;t see what the hype is? It dose not work. I work for a survey company and yes I work outside all day. As soon as the sun comes up this product has no affect. You have better luck going to the dollar store and purchasing a bottle of baby powder than wasting around 11 bucks on this worthless junk.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews, but still wasn&#x27;t sure this would work. This product is amazing. I have a very active job and not a bead of sweat or chaffing like in the past. Thank you fresh balls</li>
    <li> OH, OH SOOOO SOOTHING, TKS TO SONS FRIEND WHO RAVED ABOUT IT,,TKS</li>
    <li> I have FRESH BALLS! Day and night. The stuff works that&#x27;s all that I have to say. I am sold on it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s winter so I can&#x27;t yet know how well it will work in the summer.  I have used it about a week and it really works as advertised.  I&#x27;m impressed!  Once it dries it doesn&#x27;t even show.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want fresh balls? According to my husband, this product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. If he&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Highly over-rated product in my opinion.  Not anymore effective than straight talc powder or diaper rash cream.  Definitely not a value for the money but a wonderful gag gift.</li>
    <li> dont waste your money. it sounds too good to be true because it is</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Pure corn starch powder works much better.  You just have to keep applying powder as you sweat</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works, I guess I don&#x27;t have particularly sweaty balls and I do shower regularly and I wash my package properly but when I saw this product I couldn&#x27;t believe it and so I bought it as a gag gift for my son&#x27;s. They also thought it was hilarious. PLEASE comment on my reviews, positive or negative, so I can improve.  THANK YOU!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My second purchase of fresh balls! So Goes to show you it works. Keeps me fresh when running around and powder stain free unlike baby powder. No rubbing or irritation and no cake build up. Great product for my nuts! Yay me!</li>
    <li> Dry balls just keeps your balls nice and fresh&lt;br /&gt;avoiding itch and redness on flesh&lt;br /&gt;you put it on and it keeps them dry&lt;br /&gt;so later on from pain you won&#x27;t cry&lt;br /&gt;all this is true it is no bait,&lt;br /&gt;unless you&#x27;ve lost your balls, then... it&#x27;s too late!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author: Left Testicle</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  Much superior to gold bonds.when it says gentle warming it means just that, not the usual icy hot feeling from othercreams.</li>
    <li> i use this every single day to keep my scrotum sack fresh and dry.  if i know that i am going to have a day where my testicles might be a little more warm, i use double.</li>
    <li> Fresh balls works every time has never disappointed, a little dab will do, chicks dig it makes them come back for more</li>
    <li> Thiso is a good product works very well.</li>
    <li> It works, but my girlfriend says it tastes funny and makes her mouth numb.</li>
    <li> Perfect for after my husband&#x27;s hockey games. Doesn&#x27;t make a powdery mess! Scent free too.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this for my husband. He loves it and we always have some for him!</li>
    <li> Not as good as the earlier versions of this product.  The company changed the formula and it is not as dry.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s impossible not to sweat with my job. This product kept me dry and odor free all day. I have been very impressed!</li>
    <li> As a woman, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products to combat underarm wetness/odor.  This is the first product that has provided some help.  I have a desk job, so I don&#x27;t do a lot of rigorous activity.  This product works well for what I need it for, day to day wetness/odor protection for my underarms.  I must admit that when I went to work in the yard, the sweat and odor did return, so it may not be best for those that do rigorous activity.  As for how it works on its intended purpose - I can&#x27;t say.</li>
    <li> Overall, I feel it does not do a great job of keeping the area dry. It is better than no lotion, but I&#x27;ve used Body Time&#x27;s China Rain dry powder that works much better. That is my main criticism. My other issues with the product are minor, but they don&#x27;t help with giving it a favorable review.  I feel the packaging is wrong and the formulation of the product is wrong. Packaging is too tall to fit in my medicine cabinet. The lotion dries at the tip often. Last formulation in the shorter grey bottle, it was too &amp;#34;liquidy&amp;#34;. This iteration, the lotion dries too easily. I think they need to rethink how they dispense the lotion. Rather than a pull off cap, they need a lever that goes from flat to a tip that makes applications of wet lotion more consistent. This will also make cleaning easier when the tip is dry.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes all the difference in the world. It smells nice, feels good, and who doesn&#x27;t want to have FRESH BALLS!!</li>
    <li> When it comes to this product, I think a lot of guys have unrealistic expectations of it. More than likely, there isn&#x27;t going to be a product that will completely prevent sweat, smell, and etc. Sense using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference. I&#x27;m primarily fresh and clean at all times. I am no longer insecure about sweat and order when it comes to certain things I&#x27;m sure I can&#x27;t mention here. After discovering this product, I don&#x27;t want to ever stop using it.</li>
    <li> First, this stuff is a great product...as you can tell from the other reviews.  They&#x27;ve fixed the main problem, it being expensive.  The new 5 oz tubes give much better value and make them affordable.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Fresh Balls has always been worth the money, but now you can afford to use it all the time, plus give it away as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Fresh Balls:  Puts a zing in your pants and a bounce in your step.&lt;br /&gt;• Absolutely prevents Junk Funk for those in need AND for those who don&#x27;t think they need.&lt;br /&gt;• Fresh Balls: What every woman wants and every man needs.&lt;br /&gt;• Polish your equipment the Fresh Balls way!&lt;br /&gt;• Defuse the Funk with Happy Junk,&lt;br /&gt;• Fresh Balls:  when you want to be fresh all over and fresh all under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...OK, so much for product slogans....you get the idea.  Great product, great price.  Buy some.</li>
    <li> I have had several laser hair removal treatments to get rid of all pubic hair. The laser works on black hairs and lasts about six months. The laser will not work on white hairs so I decided to try this razor along with MAX Shave and together they really clean all the hair off, balls and all!</li>
    <li> According to husband: Cuts down on the humidity but this particular product retains a smell that is unappealing for where it is directed and what is used to apply it.</li>
    <li> We heard about it on the radio months and months ago and he has been asking for it ever since. I put it in his Christmas stocking and the tag read: From EVERYONE. :-) He says it works fabulously!</li>
    <li> TL,DR below.    Well, it smells GREAT. It works \\&quot;how it should,\\&quot; but the residue afterwords is what kills me. I don&#x27;t see how this would be a good product to use, waste of money in my opinion. Here&#x27;s my reason: after applying this lotion-like creme, it dries pretty fast after application, so overusing it is a possibility. However, the main reason I dislike this product is because after application and the \\&quot;drying-to-powder\\&quot; aspect to it, there is a whole s*** ton of residue on my junk. It fills in the crevices around your scrotum for sure, but dries leaving white powder in the \\&quot;cracks\\&quot; or \\&quot;wrinkles\\&quot; if you would call it that and is hard to manage or \\&quot;dust-off\\&quot;. Otherwise this product seemed to be great...a go on lotion, dry as powder...you&#x27;d think that it would work. Who knows, try it out (from a friend first if possible) and maybe it&#x27;ll work for you, but it didn&#x27;t satisfy my needs. I might give it another shot with some sporting activities, but that&#x27;s about it.    I am currently switching between using Cowboy Code (Manageable residue) and Gold Bond (Green) throughout the week. Cowboy Code for nights I am looking for a good time, and Gold Bond (Green) for nights at home alone (since it has that medicated smell.) These two products are what is working for now. The Gold Bond helps keep the bacteria at bay with its medicated powder I believe. I hope this review helps.    TL,DR: Too much white residue after application, leaving genitals looking like a winter wonderland. Might be better for sports or something that you wouldn&#x27;t care about how looks like down there.    Try treatments of Cowboy Code and Gold Bond (Green) throughout the week (These two products have manageable residue, unlike some baby powders I would use that left a bunch of white marks on my underwear.)</li>
    <li> Sounds like a gag gift but it really works. Much better than any competing sports powder on the market. Application is easy, just like a lotion or cream but leaves no film or greasy feel. I live in the tropics so feel like it&#x27;s a must have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find the perfect solution for &amp;#34;swamp crotch&amp;#34; and this was recommended by a few friends and some blogs. Out of all the products I&#x27;ve tried, this one works, but just ok. It helps to prevent the wetness and odor associated with &amp;#34;swamp crotch&amp;#34; to a degree, but doesn&#x27;t do as well as other solutions. The cool thing about Fresh Balls is that even though it goes on as a lotion, if you allow ample time, it dries to provide protection. Sometimes it takes longer to dry than others, but I think that has a lot to do with how much lotion one applies to his nether-bits. I found if I put skivvies on before the lotion had dried completely, Fresh Balls didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as when I would wait for the full drying effect to take place. I normally applied just after my shower and sometimes the humidity in the room made it hard to decide whether the lotion had sufficiently dried. What I didn&#x27;t like was how well Fresh Balls did or didn&#x27;t work. I expected to stay fresh, but the swamp was still there at the end of the day, though at a &amp;#34;cleaner swamp&amp;#34; level. My biggest problem with Fresh Balls is that by the end of the day, the Swamp Monster was mixing a pancake batter that tended to collect in the nooks and cranniesof the region. I had to shower just to feel clean, which defeats the purpose of using something to feel clean. Admittedly I live and work in a hot, humid environment, but I was looking for something to keep me dry, comfortable, and clean. Fresh Balls doesn&#x27;t cut it for me, and didn&#x27;t live up to the promise implied by its name. The search for truly fresh balls does not end with Fresh Balls. My favorite so far is Gold Bond spray, and until I find something better, I&#x27;ll keep some on hand. At this point, I&#x27;ll probably only use Fresh Balls for applications before working out or other times when I want to stay somewhat fresh and know I&#x27;ll be taking a shower shortly thereafter to clean the goop.</li>
    <li> Hopping out of the shower and lightly spreading this mixture of my underthings is one of the things I look forward to most each day. The tender chill at first, but the comfort and fresh smell I get throughout the entire day because of this, becomes what I most desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, this is amazing, it keeps everything downstair sweat and smell free. I apply it after drying off after a shower, and up until I shower the next day, everything is smelling pleasant and with no horrible sweatiness.</li>
    <li> I am unhappy with my product purchase. The product shown is the brand I always order however, this is not what I received.</li>
    <li> I am a wildland firefighter. I hike and dig and cut in the heat. Needless to say, I have sweaty balls. This stuff keeps them fresh and dry and minimizes chaffing from all of that hiking. Goes on like lotion and ends up like a powder. very good stuff.</li>
    <li> all I can say is that it works for me</li>
    <li> Well, now you know too much about me.  This product works great. No burning, not much stench. Just soothing lotion.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work at all. Also, beware if you have darker skin as this product dries to leave a pasty white residue. Not a good look.</li>
    <li> best product I have ever used for my BALLS</li>
    <li> This does its job but the reason for the three stars is just personal preference. It has a silky feeling as you rub it in. I just like the goldbond powder better. The powder can be messy if not careful. Powder seems to keep the twig and berries a little dryer than fresh balls.</li>
    <li> It really keeps you dry on very hot and humid days. I was absolutely amazed how it kept me dry all day long.</li>
    <li> I wanted to revise my opinion of this product so I waited a while before writing an actual review.  I had previously given the product five stars because it does do what it says - it kept me dry.  I purchased this product because I&#x27;ve gained a lot of weight, and so I&#x27;ve started a proper diet and exercise program.  Since I&#x27;m exercising vigorously five days per week I wanted something to prevent groin sweat.  This product did keep me dry, however over time I&#x27;ve noticed that I actually smell different &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; and there are random times when it&#x27;s noticeable.  Perhaps it&#x27;s like cologne - it reacts differently with each person.  I&#x27;m not saying the product is bad, but it&#x27;s clearly not for me.</li>
    <li> I have always had a problem with a sweaty groin area before I found this product. it is like deodorant for you groin area.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend, and he loves it!  It was supposed to be sort of a gag, but turns out he really needed it. I might buy some for myself, he&#x27;s raving so much.</li>
    <li> Tried this product out of curiosity after a category review shared on FB, in which  Fresh Balls was top rated. It does work. It&#x27;s a more convenient, less messy liquid/gel version of talcum powder, with a little menthol kicker. I liked it.</li>
    <li> First of all I saw this product on TV during an episode of &amp;#34;Shark Tank&amp;#34; it sounded like a great idea since I love to be fresh in that area.  I have been spreading baby powder all over everything for years and I jumped at the chance to cut the mess and have the same crisp dry feeling that i&#x27;ve come to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well the first day I tried the stuff, I got out of the shower and applied as directed. From reading the packaging I understand that it goes on wet and dries to a powder form.  What I didn&#x27;t understand is that it needs to be dry in order to dry.  When I got home from work 8 hours later I still had slippery lotion on my manpurse and in the crease of my groin.  If you have a few extra minutes to let the boys air dry then, it would be great but until they release a quick dry formula I can&#x27;t say that its a homerun product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good at first, but doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
    <li> I must not be in the minority, as I suffer from sweaty balls. I have a horrible time with cotton underwear like hanes/fotloom etc. I recently purchased some more athletic style underwear from adidas and this.  When I remember to apply it, no more sweating. I sit in class with dress pants for multiple hours a day without moving and this combination has been a life saver. don&#x27;t be afraid to apply liberally!! happy sweat free balls everyone</li>
    <li> The lotion works well as advertised. It dries into a powder without the mess. No talc and aluminum. It makes my balls soft and dry. No more itchiness. So worth it!</li>
    <li> Completely different product than what I was expecting. Thought I was getting the actual fresh balls brand not some off brand related item.</li>
    <li> Being out doors a lot during summer months my man parts can get a bit sweaty and being a kilt wearer who wears the kilt properly sweaty man parts, both fore and aft can suffer. I found this product on Amazon, read the reviews and decided to give it a try. Well my friends, this stuff works! I served 22 years in the military and have tried many things to combat man part combatants. Sweaty parts and heat can make even the toughest warriors whine out loud. I&#x27;ve tried talcum powder. Turns things into flour covered biscuit bits. I had pretty good luck with Monkey Butt products but it sometimes is not quite as productive when needed. So I recently purchased Fresh Balls to give it a test run. Results are in and all parts, fore, aft and dangley are happy. So yes, I recommend!&lt;br /&gt;I see at the end of the review page it asks for a photo. Probably should not be submitted. Ever hear the term &amp;#34;ugly as balls&amp;#34;? But if you insist on photos you&#x27;ll just have ask. Have fun my friends!</li>
    <li> This product works. .  I use it all day but at night when I go to bed I no longer need to jam a small pillow between my legs to stop my sack from sticking to my leg, so uncomfortable!  I truly am able to get to sleep faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not every guy needs something like this, but if you do, give it a try.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Way better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Easy to apply with no real mess, and then it keeps you dry all day.</li>
    <li> The name sums it up, this product provides Fresh Balls.  Now it is a  little odd I&#x27;ll admit; it&#x27;s counter intuitive rubbing lotion on the junk and expecting a dry outcome, but that&#x27;s what you get. The sent is a classic powder scent and gives you fresh balls all day, keeps me and my boys happy all day.</li>
    <li> I will never be without this product again. It&#x27;s a revelation and keeps me much more comfortable in a much cleaner manner than powder. A little goes a long way and the larger size is terrific for everything but travel (Best to fill a smaller container for travel size toiletry kits). Helped me through a deployment to Afghanistan and continues to be part of my every day routine.</li>
    <li> My balls feel so good with this. What else is there to say? Goes on as a lotion and turns into a powder. Perfect for long days with tons of walking.</li>
    <li> almost as good as they say</li>
    <li> Goes on like a cream, drys to a powder, feeling cool &amp; comfortable all day, without your balls sticking to your skin, don&#x27;t need to keep adjusting your crotch.</li>
    <li> It works well but I prefer gold bond spray because it&#x27;s not as messy.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use when I go hiking. It keep you drier and stops chafing.  Goes on like a lotion and dries to a powder.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t something one normally promotes, but I&#x27;m going to any way. I got tired of using powder/talc to keep the boys dry and friction free. Then I saw the docu-comedy &amp;#34;Mansome&amp;#34; In it, they introduced a product called &amp;#34;Fresh Balls&amp;#34; with the slogan &amp;#34;It stops bat-wing.&amp;#34; haha I got some just to give it a try and (Excuse the pun) Holy Balls this stuff works! I highly recommend it to those whose draws are a bit more free range as opposed to a chicken coup.</li>
    <li> My balls....are produce fresh. 10/10</li>
    <li> Where do I begin?  It feels like an old, toxic-dump-site swamp has been magically transformed into a clean, dry theme park where the boys are set free to play.</li>
    <li> I work in construction, and maybe I was looking for some sort of miracle to freshen up my klick-klacks...This stuff just plain don&#x27;t work for me. I applied after showers and before work. The &#x27;ol yamsacks smelled pretty good for a couple of hours, but I seemed to be sweatier in the crotchal region more so than without the product.  This caused my shnuts to even smell vinegary.  I do better with frequent showers, using Irish Spring original soap.</li>
    <li> This stuff is waaaaay better than Gold Bond...it really keeps your sack fresh all day! A few words of advice though. 1) Wash your hands right after application because, well for one...that&#x27;s really nasty if you don&#x27;t and two...this stuff gets everywhere! The other word of wisdom...tell your wife you&#x27;re using this because your underwear will look like a semen explosion at the end of the day...and that&#x27;s just really hard to explain.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It works just like powders, but without all of the messiness that applying powders make.  It is more comfortable as the day goes than lubricant sticks.</li>
    <li> What a waste! Better off buying baby powder at the dollar store. Stay way from this product. Did not keep me dry, was not comfortable when walking around, made my legs feel sticky.</li>
    <li> This does not work for South Texas heat and humidity.  It&#x27;s good for fall and winter, but I&#x27;d look for something else, unless you can reapply it every hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does try like a powder and practically no mess.  I&#x27;ve used Gold Bond powder and spray, which can make your room look like CSI was dusting for prints.</li>
    <li> My balls have never been so dry.</li>
    <li> on my 3rd bottle since discovering this magical product.  have never been more confident to quickly jump out of a chair, or take a long fast step after standing with my legs together.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it does what is advertised. Put this on in the morning and there are no worries about getting &amp;#34;swampy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I had used their previous product and worked pretty well. The new improved product does not work at all. I will not reorder.</li>
    <li> Best thing to ever happen to my balls PERIOD!</li>
    <li> This outstanding product really forms a protective velvety smooth layer on your dangily bits and surrounding areas. In the past after sitting at the desk for an excruciating period or walking in humid weather things would start clinging to each other that shouldn&#x27;t cling to each other. I&#x27;ve tried talc based powder but it made my room look like the floor of a bakery and dissipated after a short period...but not any more! I am liberated from that awful sticky existence thanks to Fresh Balls! If only I could give this product 6 stars.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this it works just doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped maybe it&#x27;ll make a super strong fresh balls</li>
    <li> Just ok....nothing exciting for sure....leaves a powdery residue so I guess you know it&#x27;s &amp;#34;working&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there are better options.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problems for years with jock rash.  Tried every over the counter medication and a few prescription ones, but they never worked well.  This stuff got rid of my rash within days.  It&#x27;s super easy to apply, and stays in place.  Goes on as a liquid, dries to a powder.  Therefore, you know it&#x27;s going to stay where you want it.  Regular powders ended up going everywhere, lotions stay moist &amp; just add to the problem.  Makes your balls feel silky smooth, even without shaving...</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be working that great for me and does leave a slight chalky substance on clothes if they get touched.  Might be ok for someone who sweats slightly, but not so much for heavy sweaters.</li>
    <li> Great product! I thought I&#x27;d try it out after reading an article and I have to say right off the bat that spray on Gold Bond spray is just as good if not better. But after trying this product I would highly recommend, especially to those who are very sensitive to the spray on powder or do not like the cold feeling from the propellant. I hate lotions and never use them so I was unsure as to how this would work, I hate that slippery feeling. But it dries immediately as a powder. Like I said, Gold Bond spray on powder works as well and I would actually say better. I don&#x27;t think I would personally buy this product again if it weren&#x27;t basically the same price as Gold Bond spray. So in conclusion, I would say try Gold Bond as it is readily available everywhere and if bothers you or you are sensitive to it give this a shot. Or just give this a shot. It was the number one pick in the article I read and Gold Bond was #2 but I think that also had to do with sensitivity with the spray. Just make sure it&#x27;s the recommended 9&amp;#34; or so away when you spray and you should be fine. But with this product there is no need for any fear. Just in case anyone was wondering, There is absolutely no irritation with this product or Gold Bond.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like the fragrance...</li>
    <li> Terrific product! Bought this for my boyfriend who was using gold bond at the time. Eliminates chaffing, no build up, and doesn&#x27;t mess with a woman&#x27;s pH ! I would highly recommend:)</li>
    <li> On a hot day this is your best friend. Works very well. my wife got the fresh breast and I got the freshballs and I don&#x27;t understand why the men&#x27;s is scented but the women&#x27;s isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This stuff really work don&#x27;t hesitate to try.</li>
    <li> Honestly, you&#x27;re better off with powder. The stuff goes on wet and dries to a powder but it kinda leaves white marks all over the place. Since it dries to a powder, whatever you touch with your hands gets white all over it.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gag gift for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday last year. But he loves it so much I bought another tube for him this year! So...I guess it works.</li>
    <li> it good, better than nothing; will try a different brand next time just to see how they compare.  Certainly wasn&#x27;t  the be-all end-all in i was expecting.</li>
    <li> This stuff works for your BALLS or your feet as well. Haven&#x27;t had a true test in the sweltering heat yet</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my teen son and my husband who both love the product... They liked it so much it got me thinking.... I exercise a lot! and my feet always get hot and sweaty which makes me prone to blisters I&#x27;m not a fan of calloused feet! Well this is amazing my feet stay dry and cool even after hours outdoors in the humid heat. Now I will not exercise without it. On a side note I didn&#x27;t care for the white residue it left behind but then I read here that if I let it dry before getting dressed that wouldn&#x27;t happen so I&#x27;ll give that a try but since I shower right after a workout it&#x27;s not that big of a deal... I&#x27;m loving my cool dry feet!!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product and there&#x27;s no more messy powder to constantly clean up.  Here&#x27;s to a great &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; summer!</li>
    <li> Husband likes it n says it works great</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but this does not work at all for me. Powder is better.</li>
    <li> Kept my man bits nice and dry!</li>
    <li> Oh so tingly.  It works pretty well and feels nice.  A lot cleaner than using powder but I think powder works just as well.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm-don&#x27;t need to go into details but I will say that it serves its purpose and does what they claim it will</li>
    <li> This stuff is simply amazing. I never rated anything five stars until now. I put it on after I get out of the shower and dry off. It has a cooling sensation, then you don&#x27;t notice it at all. You get no chafing, no sweating, and your balls smell fresh. I would gladly recommend this product to ever make out there.</li>
    <li> Giving 3 stars because I&#x27;m not sure if it works or not. If I&#x27;m in my ac it works, but I live in florida. As soon as I walk outside I still get sweaty crotch... Maybe this is for less humid climates.</li>
    <li> Thank you for making my goonies oh&#x27; so fresh and dry. Wy wife thanks you too...</li>
    <li> Pros: This works better than any other product that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps the area fresh and dry.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to stop the sweat before it happens.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on as a lotion, then dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Trivial) Con:  Tends to burn just a bit at when first applied.</li>
    <li> Definitely keeps my balls fresh. Highly recommend this for swamp crotch.</li>
    <li> bf says it really does work. Got the product idea from watching Mansome on netflix.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;no bat wings&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;LOL</li>
    <li> Best product for the groin area better then Vaseline !!</li>
    <li> Nice product. Soothing</li>
    <li> I have used the old version of the product (grey tube) before and was happy with.  It is the type of product that you don&#x27;t have to need it to appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This time I wanted to try the newer version of the product which has tea tree oil for antibacterial properties. The new product has the blue and orange tube. The description mentioned that it had the tea tree oil and the picture displayed was the blue and orange tube. When I got the product, it was the older version in the grey tube with a paper sticker that said new with a different ups code placed over the original upc code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order was fulfilled by amazon, so it they were the ones that switched the product, not the seller. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really help all that well with sweating and freshness.  I&#x27;ll stick to gold bond.</li>
