      <li>If you haven&#x27;t purchased Opium in awhile the top (as pictured) is now the spray nozzle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Love this smell of opium as I did twenty years ago!As</li>
      <li>This is my mom&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>this smell was so exotic to me</li>
      <li>and so does my Husband:)</li>
      <li>this is my wife&#x27;s favorite scent</li>
      <li>and I love smelling it on her 😃</li>
      <li>and I love the scent.</li>
      <li>I love it for myself too.</li>
      <li>While this scene or brand is the most copied for women, it was great buying her the real deal.</li>
      <li>This has been my favorite scent since I was a teenager.</li>
      <li>It is more spicy than flowery and is not overpowering.</li>
      <li>The company should consider making a better traveling container.</li>
      <li>It is not as nice as the original, but will have to do.</li>
      <li>were not all rich here, give us a break!</li>
      <li>This is a good value and much cheaper than purchasing in a dept. store.</li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t that strong anymore</li>
      <li>Price was good, shipping was quick, and I got exactly what I ordered.  </li>
      <li>and I really enjoy using it.  </li>
      <li>I thought the Opium was the original as that is how it is pictured.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Besides, who doesn&#x27;t like to be reminded how special she is ?  </li>
      <li>The fragrance cloud of Opium that we all love so much wears off quickly.  </li>
      <li>itb was wonderful,I asked what it bwas,she said Opium, I laughed and went right home to order again twenty years later</li>
      <li>Soooooo when I saw it available at a reasonable price I had to buy some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Product is fresh.</li>
      <li>Classy yet sexy.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my wife years ago and have not been able to find it in local stores.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a trick to getting the fragrance to spray exactly where it should that I haven&#x27;t quite mastered yet...  </li>
      <li>Long time favorite.</li>
      <li>As usual my wife loved the Opium-</li>
      <li>The eau de toilette does not smell much like opium, therefor I was dissapointed</li>
      <li>It was greatly appreciated</li>
      <li>Never will go out of fashion, absolutely a timeless perfume.</li>
      <li>The perfume was a Birthday gift to a very dear friend.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>If you can imagine and love the smell of &amp;#34;mysteries of the Orient&amp;#34; you will love Opium perfurme - a scent almost indescribably sexy and foreign and heady (think Oriental musk and spices) - and a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>, so I got her a new bottle for mothers day, and she loves it!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>Just like what you would buy at the store.this toilet spray is nicely packaged.just as what I expected to buy.</li>
      <li>Not so wild about the new shape of the bottle...</li>
      <li>i am disappointed---this is not the opium scent that i have been using for years---it hardly has any smell as though it is an old batch and no longer potent.</li>
      <li>It is always a big hit, and very well received, as in this purchase, it is a Mother&#x27;s Day</li>
      <li>a young woman in my twenties</li>
      <li>Bottles seem to be getting smaller and smaller put the price is higher</li>
      <li>A little pricy, but well worth it.</li>
      <li>As far as the scent, Opium is the only fragrance I wear and have been getting compliments on it for years.</li>
      <li>This colognes formula has changed, this is not the same as what I wore in the early 80&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>It probably stems from the fact that the spray port is so dinky that you can barely feel or see where it&#x27;s pointing.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This has been my favorite scent since I was a teenager. It is more spicy than flowery and is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Yves Saint Lourent is synonymous with quality and style. I recommend</li>
    <li> Your offer was a great one.  I highly recommend it.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife years ago and have not been able to find it in local stores.  Great smell and good value.</li>
    <li> Love the perfume and the service I recieved!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that the bottle has changed. I&#x27;ve been wearing this for 20 years. It has a very distinctive scent that is heavy. It stays with you all day. THIS is not the same scent! It&#x27;s fruitier and doesn&#x27;t last a few hours if that much. YSL needs to read customer comments or reviews and get back to its origins.</li>
    <li> My favorite for my wife, and hers too! This and the Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder. Classy yet sexy.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it. it was the best way to buy it.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Price was good, shipping was quick, and I got exactly what I ordered.  This is my signature scent.</li>
    <li> I thought the Opium was the original as that is how it is pictured.  I kept my order anyway.  It is not as nice as the original, but will have to do.</li>
    <li> good perfume...but come on with the price!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s too EXPENSIVE!!! were not all rich here, give us a break!</li>
    <li> This was for a friend of mine..(Birthday) and she loves it....</li>
    <li> This is simply an poor imitation as I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is gone in just a few minutes&lt;br /&gt;after putting it on your skin.I am very unhappy&lt;br /&gt;with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Been giving this to my wife for 40 some years... She is still my drug of choice.... and this fragrance is her.</li>
    <li> I like it,smells good.</li>
    <li> As usual my wife loved the Opium- it blends well with her skin chemistry to provide a long lasting fragrance</li>
    <li> Made a happy wife. .That is the best review I can give, since it came quickly, priced right and made my wife happy.</li>
    <li> This is my mom&#x27;s favorite perfume. She has had a bottle for 20 years and it only had a tiny bit left and it wasn&#x27;t that strong anymore, so I got her a new bottle for mothers day, and she loves it! Says it smells like it always has!!</li>
    <li> It is always a big hit, and very well received, as in this purchase, it is a Mother&#x27;s Day gift.&lt;br /&gt;Besides, who doesn&#x27;t like to be reminded how special she is ?  I love it for myself too.</li>
    <li> the sister-in-law loves it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite!  Very suttle, not overwhelming. A little pricy, but well worth it. Would have given it five stars except for the price.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews before making the decision to purchase this perfume and frankly they made me hesitate to buy it for several months - but finally placed the order and I&#x27;m glad I did. I made the purchase from Amazon and it&#x27;s the perfect, classic yves Saint Laurent Opium perfume -  intoxicating and long-lasting (but not so long-lasting you&#x27;ll want to gag). I can&#x27;t swear I have perfect smell capability but the Opium I received is the very same Opium scent purchased back in the day at department stores but for twice the price.  If you can imagine and love the smell of &amp;#34;mysteries of the Orient&amp;#34; you will love Opium perfurme - a scent almost indescribably sexy and foreign and heady (think Oriental musk and spices) - and a little goes a long way.  If you haven&#x27;t purchased Opium in awhile the top (as pictured) is now the spray nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any issues with this scent lasting and cannot detect any differences (subtle or otherwise) in the way fragrance smells or lasts. Finally - I can afford a bottle of Opium perfume!</li>
    <li> Love this smell of opium as I did twenty years ago!As a young woman in my twenties this smell was so exotic to me wore it for years and then my taste changed and I went on to another scent,one day I smelled this ladies scent and itb was wonderful,I asked what it bwas,she said Opium, I laughed and went right home to order again twenty years later and this Opium is still wonderful as befor thank you great smell,it held up well, wish I did like twenty years ago LOL,but the scent reminds me of all the good times I had and will again BUY this Opium you will lov it.</li>
    <li> i got this for my Mom for her X-mas. She loved it&#x27;s smell and the cost was great. While this scene or brand is the most copied for women, it was great buying her the real deal.</li>
    <li> The eau de toilette does not smell much like opium, therefor I was dissapointed</li>
    <li> I have been buying Opium for years.  It is my perfume/Eau de Toilette of choice and I really enjoy using it.  It is long lasting and when I wear it someone always comments.  Usually I buy the regular sizes, however, when I travel I need something smaller.  Since YSL changed their product packaging I have to buy this smaller size.  It is a little heavy (glass bottle) and somewhat inconvenient to travel with.  It also tends to leak when packed in a suitcase.  The company should consider making a better traveling container.</li>
    <li> Long time favorite. Makes my girl of 34 years very happy.  Never will go out of fashion, absolutely a timeless perfume.</li>
    <li> My order arrived in a box with no packing material to keep it from moving around in transit. I opened it immediately and the bottle was intact. But there should be some sort of packing to keep the contents from damage. As far as the scent, Opium is the only fragrance I wear and have been getting compliments on it for years.</li>
    <li> I like it and it smells really good. Lots of compliments</li>
    <li> Gift. Excellent reported by recipient</li>
    <li> i am disappointed---this is not the opium scent that i have been using for years---it hardly has any smell as though it is an old batch and no longer potent.</li>
    <li> Love it.  It has been a favorite of mine for years.  A good buy!</li>
    <li> Great evening fragrance. I even spray this on my sheets.</li>
    <li> Just like what you would buy at the store.this toilet spray is nicely packaged.just as what I expected to buy.</li>
    <li> My Mother has been wearing this perfume for years and I love the scent. This is a good value and much cheaper than purchasing in a dept. store.</li>
    <li> The wife loves it and I love smelling it on her 😃</li>
    <li> this is my wife&#x27;s favorite scent</li>
    <li> Good quick service, love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Best price I have found on this product so far!</li>
    <li> Hard to find just anywhere.  I have used this for 40 years.</li>
    <li> Opium has always been a favorite scent of mine and I was almost out Soooooo when I saw it available at a reasonable price I had to buy some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it and so does my Husband:)</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for my girlfriend as a Christmas gift. It was a hit!! She loves it!!!</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT WAS DELIVERED AND THE PACKAGING WAS IN GREAT CONDITION AND I AM VERY PLEASED WITH IT. MY MOTHER IN LAW WILL LOVE THE PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> A Christmas gift and she loved it</li>
    <li> Opium is one of those fragrances that most people love; and I am no exception. It is rather expensive, but you can use it sparingly and it will stay with you all day and night long. It is delectable!</li>
    <li> My sister loves this so this is my go to gift for her.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Opium for over 30 years...it&#x27;s the only fragrance my husband likes.  So great to find it at a fabulous price!!</li>
    <li> This colognes formula has changed, this is not the same as what I wore in the early 80&#x27;s. I do not know who is in charge of the Yves Saint Laurent empire but they should have left perfection alone. If Mr. Yves Saint Laurent were alive today he would be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The perfume was a Birthday gift to a very dear friend. It was greatly appreciated</li>
    <li> Love Opium. I hope they make it forever!! This was the best price I found anywhere!</li>
    <li> Bottles seem to be getting smaller and smaller put the price is higher</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom. We both adore the scent. Product is fresh. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> i am trying to leave a feedback but this is not in my account..  i need to change my feedbac.  i need some help!!  this is the only product that is not in my account which is the last thing i purchased.  i have tried everything to change the feedback on shadesandsprays!!!!!</li>
    <li> as expected. Not as pictured on review page</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Great price...  Not so wild about the new shape of the bottle... There&#x27;s a trick to getting the fragrance to spray exactly where it should that I haven&#x27;t quite mastered yet...  It probably stems from the fact that the spray port is so dinky that you can barely feel or see where it&#x27;s pointing.  Also, it seems that the scent has been diluted a bit in its&#x27; strength...kind of disconcerting... The fragrance cloud of Opium that we all love so much wears off quickly.  Yves should maybe rethink profit margin and take this lot back to the drawing board.  My money is on Youth Dew now...sorry!  :o(</li>
    <li> Wonder smell, great perfume</li>
</ol>
