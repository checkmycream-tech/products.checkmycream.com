      <li>Absolutely the Best deodorant/antiperspirant available!</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>Love it-have been using it for years.</li>
      <li>so these work even better on smoothest skin.</li>
      <li>It is not over-drying and has no smell which I love; it doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume.  </li>
      <li>I do appreciate being able to get thru Amazon.</li>
      <li>Works well most of the time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products from Amazon to help with my sweaty palms and feet.  </li>
      <li>I tried this deodorant and wanted to love it, but on me it didn&#x27;t work</li>
      <li>and I feel safe that the credit card won&#x27;t be hacked as I have done business with Amazon before...</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more, since stores don&#x27;t carry it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t go through these very quickly so to prevent the pads from evaporating</li>
      <li>She said, you really can go 5 days without putting it on again!!!</li>
      <li>The smell of the pads is kind of older woman musk</li>
      <li>I like having a fresh pad every day, and the formula, when patted on the skin, dries quickly and invisibly, another feature I love.</li>
      <li>As I never could find an antiperspirant that I liked a lot, I hunted around for the ones I remembered, and could not find them either in MI or NC where I now live.  </li>
      <li>and shes glad that she got it to thanks and god bless</li>
      <li>, this&#x27;s the only product i use, nothing else works, i&#x27;ve tried many many products</li>
      <li>and she gets a years worth at a time.  </li>
      <li>Just by judging these in the jar you would think yeah right.</li>
      <li>A doctor suggested I get these pads to handle my excessive sweating around my forehead and they work great.  </li>
      <li>and it does very much so help with odor control.  </li>
      <li>I has never failed me.</li>
      <li>It also seems to make me sweat even more definitely</li>
      <li>I guess that pretty well tells the story.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>These require more time than a standard swipe though.</li>
      <li>The actual product I love.</li>
      <li>I like the pads better than the roll-on only because it lasts much longer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all a mess, buy at your own risk.</li>
      <li>since there&#x27;s so much liquid in the jar.</li>
      <li>So I make sure one is really wet and dab on Both armpits until</li>
      <li>I buy this for my mother who has used this product here whole life.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>so i was very dissapointed with it.</li>
      <li>The solution that moistens the pads is very viscous.</li>
      <li>One caution, you must have a very leak-proof container.</li>
      <li>Not only do I not sweat, but they also leave me odor less, which is really nice!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day because it has worn off when I have been more active.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and fresh, and the pads are tiny and have just enough &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34; that you will need.</li>
      <li>It does work really well as an anti-perspirant with normal activity.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended product.</li>
      <li>I have used this since I was in high school.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if one really lasts for 5 days, but with that many per bottle</li>
      <li>then I take a hairdryer on cool setting and take 1.5 minutes to dry them.</li>
      <li>(I live in Seattle.)  </li>
      <li>The pads dry too quickly.</li>
      <li>(it may be the high percentage of aluminum or my highly sensitive skin or both).</li>
      <li>and wow!</li>
      <li>Other wise I use it everyday.  </li>
      <li>I was a bit concerned that it may not be the same exact product as I found in the drug stores, but it is, or it has been so far.</li>
      <li>I actually use Certain Dri under my arms.  </li>
      <li>Its hard to find, thats why I was glad when I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been working for me so far</li>
      <li>As far as I can tell this product is not sold in stores anymore</li>
      <li>She is 78 years old</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve sold so many people on it w/o one complaint.</li>
      <li>Stops the sweating as far as I can tell, but I haven&#x27;t tested it in summer heat yet.</li>
      <li>She is 77 years old and does not use the computer.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t throw away the pad after each use since there is so much product still left on them.  </li>
      <li>I had a 72 year old gental man give me this tip, so I tried it.</li>
      <li>I am now 74 yrs old.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to find at drug stores, so I&#x27;ve been ordering it off line.  </li>
      <li>5 Day Fresh actually keeps me dry without any odor at all.</li>
      <li>Be careful opening them the first time.  </li>
      <li>and I know of no other product that even comes close.  </li>
      <li>Every since I was young, this was the only deodorant that would work for me.</li>
      <li>In conjunction with SweatBlock, this classic formula keeps me dry every day.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these for those who have tried other deodorants and they haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s been amazingly dry and no morphed scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> 5 day a very effective deodorant.  He uses it daily for 20 years and I have never noticed any B.O. spells.</li>
    <li> I still sweat during the day, even after 5 days. Did not work for me!</li>
    <li> My mother swears by this product. She was so upset when she couldn&#x27;t find the product in any drug or grocery store. She is 77 years old and does not use the computer. I told her it could  be found on the internet. So I searched and it was on Amazon.com... I ordered it for her and she&#x27;s extremly happy. She said, you really can go 5 days without putting it on again!!! Just in case you are in a rush and forget!</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell this product is not sold in stores anymore (I live in Seattle.)  I buy this for my mother who has used this product here whole life.  She is 78 years old so she has been using this product for about 65 years.  I&#x27;m so happy I can find 5 Day on Amazon for my mother.</li>
    <li> Awesome for hands and feet.  I&#x27;ve tried many products from Amazon to help with my sweaty palms and feet.  It&#x27;s especially a problem for me since I practice yoga almost daily and my hands would slide all over the place.  Sweat Block did help, but I had to use three pads three nights in a row and then maintain every 2-3 days or it didn&#x27;t work. Too expensive for me.  This product works great.  I actually use Certain Dri under my arms.  For hands and feet I use one pad for hands and another for feet every 2-3 days and the difference is amazing.  I tried going without it for a week to see if my body had menopausal body had changed and half way through practice I was having a lot of difficulty staying in downdog.  For me a very effective and cost friendly product. Much less expensive at drugstore.com</li>
    <li> I use these on my feet - they work wonderfully with the sweating and these pads have a nice scent.  Highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for travel, specifically for use with carry-on luggage, and was very satisfied. You can pack what you need in a small container. It is not liquid and thus can stay in your carry on without having to be screened separately. It works well enough for deodorant. One caution, you must have a very leak-proof container. The solution that moistens the pads is very viscous.</li>
    <li> The actual product I love. It works so well &amp; I switch between this &amp; regular deodorant. Unfortunately, the product arrived in bad shape. The packaging was damp because somehow the seal was opened. So for this reason &amp; this reason alone I am giving 3 stars.</li>
    <li> product is awesome!! i love it, this&#x27;s the only product i use, nothing else works, i&#x27;ve tried many many products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 5 Day deodorant pads for 50+ years.  I like it.  It arrived on time, but package was wet. It had leaked in the package.  Not sure how because the seal didn&#x27;t appear to be broken and there didn&#x27;t seem to be much of the liquid missing.  Strange.  Will be ordering more, since stores don&#x27;t carry it.  I can only get it online.</li>
    <li> Good product.  I use it to dry up poison ivy (only on unbroken skin/blisters).  A pharmacist recommended it years ago.  It&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to find at drug stores, so I&#x27;ve been ordering it off line.  I was a bit concerned that it may not be the same exact product as I found in the drug stores, but it is, or it has been so far.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. The scent is light and fresh, and the pads are tiny and have just enough &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34; that you will need. I use one every day. I&#x27;m not sure if one really lasts for 5 days, but with that many per bottle I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances.I went to Jamaica in the middle of summer for a day-time wedding and swathed these all over my body! It does what it claims to do which is stop excess perspiration, so I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I tried this product it did not work for me one bit. the purchasing and packaging was good, i got it on time but when i tried it , it did not work for me. I put it on i still kept on sweating. I wouldn&#x27;t advise you to purchase this product because it does not work. i would have wanted it to work and the crazy thing was i said i&#x27;ll keep using until it works for me but it didn&#x27;t so i was very dissapointed with it.</li>
    <li> Love it-have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be a cheaper alternative to my usual brand.... And it wasn&#x27;t. Oh well back to the usual!</li>
    <li> In conjunction with SweatBlock, this classic formula keeps me dry every day. It&#x27;s a lifesaver. I like having a fresh pad every day, and the formula, when patted on the skin, dries quickly and invisibly, another feature I love. It does not show, even on dark grey or black clothes.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says, but you have to use it everyday, which I was hoping to use just once a week like the other products on the market. Otherwise a good product. Stops the sweating as far as I can tell, but I haven&#x27;t tested it in summer heat yet.</li>
    <li> A doctor suggested I get these pads to handle my excessive sweating around my forehead and they work great.  I don&#x27;t go through these very quickly so to prevent the pads from evaporating, I keep the container in a zip lock bag.</li>
    <li> My entire family has used &amp;#34;5 Day&amp;#34; for years. Both sexes. Very effective. Has never let me down. Husband can even tolerate the fragerance since it does the job.</li>
    <li> They work great for your hands while golfing in the heat.  Keeps them dry.</li>
    <li> These are so great. Not only do I not sweat, but they also leave me odor less, which is really nice! I work out like crazy and live in Texas, so sweating is a huge problem. I highly recommend these for those who have tried other deodorants and they haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me and I have hyperhidrosis. Maybe it might work for others. For those like me who&#x27;ve tried literally everything on the market with no success, please give Nivea dry comfort a try. It&#x27;s been working for me so far and I&#x27;ve been using it since July 23rd. Usually it&#x27;s either antiperspirants don&#x27;t work for me at all (eg Secret Clinical strength) or they&#x27;ll work for 1-2 days then my body gets over it or used to it and it stops working and/or starts to burn/irritate my under arms to the point where my skin starts to peel off like it did with Kiss My Face-- it did both stopped working after 2 days and burned my skin off. But not with Nivea. So far it&#x27;s been amazingly dry and no morphed scent. It says 48 hrs of dryness but with my experience it lasts for about a day and a half without applying a second application on that second day I&#x27;ve only done this on the weekend. Other wise I use it everyday.  It&#x27;s pretty frickin awesome :)</li>
    <li> Works well most of the time. I don&#x27;t use it every day because it has worn off when I have been more active. It does work really well as an anti-perspirant with normal activity.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have used this since I was in high school. I am now 74 yrs old. I has never failed me. Its hard to find, thats why I was glad when I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this product for the past 15+ years.  It is not over-drying and has no smell which I love; it doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume.  I have actually forgotten to put it on one day and never even noticed! This is the only deodorant we use.  I have tried others and have kept coming back to this.  One container lasts forever!! Way longer than a stick.  It has never stained my clothing either.  I don&#x27;t throw away the pad after each use since there is so much product still left on them.  Be careful opening them the first time.  Once you peel away the aluminum seal, there is liquid so be careful not to spill it.  When I travel, I put a couple of the pads in a tiny tupperware type plastic container with lid since sometimes it can leak if left on its side too long.</li>
    <li> Been using for four days now and wow! Just by judging these in the jar you would think yeah right. But they truly work. I would have to switch deodorants every month from secret to ban because of thief different active drug. Now I can use these and never switch even on hormonal days. These require more time than a standard swipe though. The pads are small and identical to stridex and other makeup remover pads that float in liquid. So I make sure one is really wet and dab on Both armpits until really wet then I take a hairdryer on cool setting and take 1.5 minutes to dry them. I wax so I never have that stubble so these work even better on smoothest skin. I noticed even after 12 hours no smellies or dampness at all! The smell of the pads is kind of older woman musk but it goes away within minutes! Try it!</li>
    <li> Great stuff I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
    <li> First, it left white residue or streak on my skin, it looked horrible. It DID control somewhat my sweating, but not it wasn&#x27;t very effective. It has a horrible, strong smell. The pads dry too quickly. It itches and stings A LOT (it may be the high percentage of aluminum or my highly sensitive skin or both). The bottle is like a mess inside. It&#x27;s all a mess, buy at your own risk.</li>
    <li> Every since I was young, this was the only deodorant that would work for me. and I know of no other product that even comes close.  Being able to buy it through Amazon is convenient because trying to find it in various pharmacies tends to be difficult.</li>
    <li> I remember my parents using this 60+ years ago, and it stuck in my mind.  As I never could find an antiperspirant that I liked a lot, I hunted around for the ones I remembered, and could not find them either in MI or NC where I now live.  So I went to Amazon and found it, and have been buying them ever since.  Oh, by the way, I think this is the best antiperspirant out there.</li>
    <li> I tried this deodorant and wanted to love it, but on me it didn&#x27;t work it made me smell worst and i constantly had to be applying it. It also seems to make me sweat even more definitely not what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have used it for 64 years.  I guess that pretty well tells the story.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed that I can&#x27;t buy it in the US when I travel there.&lt;br /&gt;It would save me shipping costs.  We go regularly to US as I was&lt;br /&gt;born there.  I do appreciate being able to get thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> This 5 day works well for me.  No white marks on my clothes and it does very much so help with odor control.  I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product must be extremely good.  My Mother has me order it for her every year and she gets a years worth at a time.  She was getting panic sticken when I checked with CVS where I usually get it and they were out of stock.  Luckily Amazon found it for me and she is happy.  I don&#x27;t like to just order from anyone off the net cause I have been highjacked money wise with my debit card before but I trust this site.  That says it all, we got the \\&quot;must have\\&quot; items mother wanted and I feel safe that the credit card won&#x27;t be hacked as I have done business with Amazon before...Go Amazon</li>
    <li> I ordered this deodorant after a long search of trying to find one that worked for me. I was skeptical at first but now I will not use anything else. I&#x27;ve ordered enough to last me a long time because of the price. I &#x27;m very glad I found this product:-)</li>
    <li> My Mother loves this deodorant and wont use anything else.  i can only find it on line</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well for me as it may have for others. Can&#x27;t rate this product past two stars.</li>
    <li> Keeps me dry and ODERLESS even under stress.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s saying alot when as a healthcare worker i am on my feet and lifting others all day.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the Best deodorant/antiperspirant available! I don&#x27;t glisten when I hike. I sweat-alot. So uncomfortable. 5 Day Fresh actually keeps me dry without any odor at all. Incredible. I&#x27;ve sold so many people on it w/o one complaint. I was devastated when Rite Aid stopped carrying it, &amp; I had to go back to being uncomfortably wet &amp; smelly w/ all the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength crap that does nothing for me. SO happy to find it on Amazon!! I like the pads better than the roll-on only because it lasts much longer. You can reuse one pad at least 10x since there&#x27;s so much liquid in the jar. Trust me &amp; try it!</li>
    <li> This product worked good for the wetness but not for the odor. I was disappointed to find that out after purchasing the product.</li>
    <li> Great product it putting a shine on your dress shoes. I had a 72 year old gental man give me this tip, so I tried it. Amazing shine. Wish I had know about this twenty years ago, when I was in the Army. Would have saved a lot of spit shinning time.</li>
    <li> the product is for my mom and she loves it very much like i said she is very happy whit it but poor deliver not on time but got it now and shes glad that she got it to thanks and god bless</li>
