<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Argan Oil has been used in Morocco for centuries. Only recently have we realized what we had been missing. Argan Oil moisturizes and softens skin, helps treat stretch marks, and gives skin a youthful glow. It repairs and nourishes hair, improving scalp health, treats split-ends, and controls frizz. It can strengthen brittle nails and soften cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eliminer Moroccan Argan Oil is 100% Pure &amp; Organic.  It comes with a dropper in the lid for easy dispensing.  When my skin is dry I massage a few drops of the oil onto my skin, as it provides lasting moisture.  I also use the oil daily as a part of my hair care routine. I massage a few drops of Argan Oil into my damp hair before I blow dry. My hair is less frizzy, my ends are less dry, and my hair has much more shine when I use Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil is such a great product, and I would absolutely recommend Eliminer Moroccan Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
    <li> I have been using Eliminer Moroccan Argan oil for over a week now. I have long blonde hair past my shoulders. My hair usually gets very dried out and I begin to experience split ends, because of the sun and the pool. Since I have been using this product, my hair has become very soft and silky. My hair color has become more vibrant and my split ends have disappeared. This product is very easy to use.  I usually apply a couple of drops in the palm of my hands and then run it through my damp hair. I love that this product is 100% pure organic. It does not leave my hair feeling greasy or heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I received this for free to sample I love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I  Love it and it is great on the hair or face and skin plus ^__^ Excellent</li>
    <li> I love this brand and their natural ingredients. Also love how it makes my skin feel and how I don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking out or getting rash from harsh chemicals like other brands. Easy to apply and not heavy once on. You will love your skin again. *Disclosure I did receive this product free to review but that in no way sways my opinion while I test and write my reviews.</li>
    <li> Argan oil has become a really popular product, so I wanted to try it out. I’m a big believer in science, follow reddit’s r/SCA nad r/Asianbeauty and read science articles: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3723062/ is the most convincing. It’s been proven to have anti-inflammation (reduce redness), anti-aging, and inhibit melanin synthesis (prevents uneven complexion). So I’ve been very interested in it. It’s also non-comedogenic (won’t clog your pores). So this’ll be great as an oil cleanser. I also personally use it for my hair to hinder frizzness and give it a healthy shine. I also use it as a heat protectant when straightening my hair. This is a great (and cheap) argan oil (organic, in an amber bottle). Josie Maran, the most famous brand, charges $50 for 50ml!!! By comparison, this is currently $11 for 120ml. Save your money, this is the same thing at a way cheaper price. Adorable packing that’s perfect for a gift. Totally recommend!&lt;br /&gt;*Honest review for discounted product*</li>
    <li> Product for review: I am really enjoying my argon oil. I use it as a daily routine. It is a great oil to substitute lotion, great to ease frizz, put a little in your shampoo and body wash also! I would highly recommend this product and company</li>
    <li> Will SURE LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;Been using Argan Oil and will CONTINUE doing it&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s FANTASTIC got the discount from 30+ to ELEVEN?!?! WOOOOOW&lt;br /&gt;This seller REALLY takes into account CUSTOMER SERVICE&lt;br /&gt;Will sure buy from them in the future!!</li>
    <li> First, really wish this company had not emailed me 3x asking for a review.... It&#x27;s bad practice. Asking once--if you really find it necessary--is sufficient, twice is over-sight and obnoxious, three times is bad practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, that&#x27;s not why I gave 3 stars. That&#x27;s for the ACTUAL product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative reviews have thus far mentioned the fragrance, which I think is actually more subdued in this brand than others. Not that I&#x27;m a particular fan of the fragrance of argan oil  (nor have I ever particularly disliked it), but the fact that the fragrance is, in my opinion, more subdued than other brands is symptomatic of the actual issue at hand...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is much thinner than other argan oils I have gotten in the past -- a fact worth mentioning because it is indicative of the quality of the oil and the process with which it&#x27;s made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This consistency makes it more difficult to combine this oil with other products (such as essential oils for various first-aid related tinctures especially, but also hair masks, etc).</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is so pure! Its my all time favourite!! I love this oil, its non-sticky, smells great! It comes with droper so easy to use!  I have extream dry hair and skin, after washing my hair i apply two to three drops of argan oil on my hair as hair serum, it tam my frizzy hair, it makes my hair silky soft! I&#x27;m honestly in love with this oil.  I also use this oil on my face as a mosturizer, omg it makes skin baby soft!  I would recommend this Argan oil to All!!  ***i got this product in exchange of my honest Review, but the opinion is my own!</li>
    <li> I used it a few times only. So far, it was great! Fast shipping and great seller. Need more time to update the result of using it.</li>
    <li> I had heard so many positive things about Argan oil, but I wasn’t sure what to do with it. I used to think of it as just a hair oil. I got the Argan oil from Eliminer and after doing some research, have been experimenting since the past week. I have not used other brands of Argan oils, and will not be able to compare to other brands. However, this oil seems to be great and very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Face moisturizer - Before sleeping, after cleansing face, I apply 2 - 3 drop of oil on face and have noticed my face glow in the morning. The oil gets absorbed easily and doesn’t make face greasy.&lt;br /&gt;- Leave-in Hair conditioner / Serum - After shower, I have been using few drop of Argan oil to wet hair before styling. This prevents from hair damage due to heat. Also adds shine and reduced frizz once the hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;- Hair treatment - Before sleeping, I massage my hair, ends and scalp with Argan oil, wrap it with towel and wash it off the next morning. I have noticed my hair to be soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;- Face masks - Have also been adding it to store bought face masks. Apply as usual and wash off.&lt;br /&gt;- Lip moistorizer - Apply a drop before sleeping and notice your lips the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;- Nails - Massage a few drops to your nails and notice soft and beautiful nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the purchase and would recommend this Argan oil. I received a discount on the Argan oil for my review, however I am completely honest and no way affecting my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love using my large bottle of organic argan oil for my hair. But it&#x27;s also great to use for my face as well. I&#x27;ve seen a difference in the few days I have used it on my hair. I have used it on my face as well which helps hydrate it because of medicine I take my skin has Gotten dry and bad within a few week. With the argan oil it has helped me greatly to feel fresh hydrated and help with my changing skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would greatly recommend this product to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;100 %  of this review is of my own personal experience and I recieved this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been to the dermatologist and they recommended Vanicream which I have purchased. The cream does an okay job but a friend recommended putting argan oil underneath the lotion. I purchased this oil based on the reviews and  have been using it morning and night. So far I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. I have scaly dry patches on my face and by using this oil in combination with my cream the patches stay gone all day. With just the cream my dry skin stays at bay for probably 4-5 hours. The oil did not break me out  and has relieved  the dryness in my skin. I will be buying another bottle of this. Someone asked about the smell, my bottle has a faint scent that almost smells like coffee. I don&#x27;t find it to be unpleasant and it goes away shortly after application.</li>
    <li> My health condition and some of my prescription medications have taken a toll on my skin and hair - making them more dry than usual. The dryness specially bothers me during the colder months because honestly, extremely dry skin that doesn&#x27;t respond to most lotions and creams hurt - literally. I started using Argan Oil and Raw Shea Butter to combat the dryness on my hair and skin and this combo works like a champ! I specifically love this brand because it is all organic so I use it not just on my hair and body, but for my lips, face and nails as well! I love how it works for my perpetually dry skin and body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a blogger, I am often provided Press Sample kits by companies for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Really nice oil. I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair and noticed a big improvement in feel and manageability. I&#x27;m a man who generally uses hair but I decided to see how it worked with the argan oil.  Not only is my hair immediately softer, but I can brush it back with a very natural-looking (and not oily!) hold.</li>
    <li> I received the oil within two days of ordering it. I have used argan oil before, but never did I buy one that had this smell: it is faint, thank goodness, and reminiscing of industrial products. The oil has a great viscosity and leaves my skin and hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> The argan oil works as promised and provided my skin with lots of lightweight but effective moisture. I never felt oily or greasy just smooth. I love the oil it makes my hair feel like silk.I can tell the difference in just a few days of using this product. I use it protect my hair from heat and the elements and it only takes a few drops to cover.  This product was received either at no or  low cost for review of the product. All opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing oil. I use it on my hair ,mix it with coconut oil and it leaves my hair very soft  and gives a shine to it . I also love to use this on my nails and it helps to prevent dry an brittle nails. On my hair, I use it in two different ways, one i mix it with coconut oil and leave it for sometime and then wash my hair.I do not apply a conditioner afterwards ,but you may use it if you like . Another way i just take this oil by itself ,just a few drops and apply on my hair ,it helps prevent frizzy hair and makes my hair more manageable.  Another way I like to use this is on my face ,it does not feel greasy and is lightweight. It works as a moisturizer for the face. Really a nice product ..&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> My Argan oil came in a closed container, but when I opened it up, it smelt like garbage. I&#x27;m going to return it. I&#x27;ve talked to another reviewer who had the same problem and it&#x27;s very disappointing :( Most of the reviewers have had good experiences with the product and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great, but maybe the had a spoilt batch. Came with a dropper attached to the lid and plastic ring around the top that you rip to open. PLEASE SMELL IT BEFORE YOU USE IT.</li>
    <li> When you use essential oils, you need a carrier oil. The base that will make sure your essential oil will not burn your skin (being so concentrated) and will soothe your skin. I tend to get irritated when I don&#x27;t use enough carrier oil, so I air on the side of caution and use 4 or 5 drops to every drop of essential oil. Argan oil does so many other things though. I no longer use conventional shampoo and conditioner, but instead use an alternitive. From time to time I can use a deeper conditioning for my scalp and ends of my hair, and Argan oil comes in once again. I have begun treating the person I care take for with Argan oil for skin issues like psoriasis and eczema, and it works fantastic! The skin is left softer and smoother than before. The oil is very high quality, no pieces of junk in it or anything. The bottle is glass, dark so the oil stays good, and the dropper is also glass. I get asked that frequently when discussing essential oils and carrier oils with people who also use them. When they are looking to buy one, I usually get the &amp;#34;Is the dropper glass too?&amp;#34; I guess with all the new studies on plastic and what chemicals they can give off, glass is always the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. EVERYTHING IN THIS REVIEW IS 100% MY OWN AND HAS NOT BEEN INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY</li>
    <li> As far as Argan Oil goes, this brand is great! I have a lot of different brands and I really like the fact that this is 100% Organic. In a world full of unnecessary additives, it is nice to see companies getting back to the basics. I have been using this oil for several days now not only on my hair, but on my hands, face, and even my lower abdomen where I have stretchmarks.  While it is too soon to see significant changes, my hair is feeling softer and looks shinier and my nails are not dried out from this Texas heat. I personally like adding just a little to my conditioner and letting it set on my hair while I shower. While my hair is damp, I add about a drop or two before heat styling. There is no smell which I like since I would rather it not compete with my body spray. The bottle is large, however a little goes a long ways so it should last quite a while. The top is a dropper so it is easier to control how much you use at a time and eliminates waste. All around, it seems to be a great product and I will continue to use it in hopes to see better results where my stretchmarks are concerned. I did receive this product for free to test and review and do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Above superior product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again...</li>
    <li> Not very happy with this oil, it has a smell not like Josie maran argan oil that doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance</li>
    <li> Eliminer is a new brand for me but I was excited to try their argan oil.  I love argan oil.  I mainly use it in my hair products and it keeps my hair soft and shiny.  This is a very generous 4 oz bottle of argan oil. It is 100% Pure Organic. It&#x27;s in a glass bottle with a dropper top.  I love oils to have a dropper because it is very easy to dispense the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil is known as &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34;. It has tons of vitamins, minerals, anti-oxidants, fatty-acids, that promote overall health by moisturizing, softening, and protecting your hair and face from sun damage. Not only is argan oil good for your hair, you can use it on your nails, skin, and face.  It is very light weight and quickly absorbed by the skin without leaving the greasy feeling behind.  Once the winter arrives I plan to add a few drops to my hands paying close attention to my cuticles because they get very dry during the cold season. I have enjoyed this brand of argan oil.  It is a great addition to my beauty cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at no cost in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I enjoy writing reviews and put a lot of effort into how I feel about the products. I think it is important as consumers to make a well informed decision before purchasing a product.</li>
