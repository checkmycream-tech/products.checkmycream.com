    <li> For my entire life I have had the worst dark circles, after using this product for a little more than a week my dark circles dramatically decreased. The only thing I was say that I&#x27;m disappointed about in this product is how small the portion was. When I looked at the picture I thought it was a lot bigger of a bottle then it actually was. When I got it, it was only a little bigger than my thumb.</li>
    <li> I used product as directed. there was no changes but a greasy feeling.  I really don&#x27;t understand what it claims to fix but this product is a waste of time and money. wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> This was s gift and they loved it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Murad for over almost 15 years. Always great results</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and the size; goes far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with genetic dark circles, this is the cure! I&#x27;ve tried many products and nothing has worked like this! I usually wear tattoo concealer because my dark circles are so bad, but now I can do with regular foundation. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even wear concealer! Anyone with dark circles knows how miraculous and unbelievable that is!</li>
    <li> I love murad products and this is no exception. only thing is I wish it was bigger so it would last longer.</li>
    <li> I like this eye cream. It feels silky and stays matte all day. Used an Olay eye cream but it was greasy and shiny on my skin. I bought the sample this eye cream, just to try, and was impressed with how long it has lasted. Have not yet washed my face, this morning, but the skin around my eyes still feels soft &amp; moisturized. All of us have different skin types &amp; not every product works for everyone... This one works for me and I plan to continue using it. My age is 60+ and my skin type is dry&#x27;ish....</li>
    <li> Was broken when arrived. I did gave one star because  arrived on time.</li>
