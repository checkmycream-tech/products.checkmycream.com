### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I cannot tolerate fragrances and this spray is perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>This product is the BEST styling spray I have EVER used.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I can order it from Amazon, because I buy it by the dozen.  </li>
      <li>Some people are greatly allergic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars because I didn&#x27;t follow directions and it may work great otherwise.  </li>
      <li>Very nice.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant.</li>
      <li>Not too good for holding your style, but it does make my hair shine.</li>
      <li>This styling spray feels really good.</li>
      <li>and I still look good at the end of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Good thing</li>
      <li>It is natral and good for your hair.</li>
      <li>It works great, holds nicely, doesn&#x27;t have a scent, and it isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
      <li>I had heard aloe vera was good for your hair, so I decided to give this product a try.</li>
      <li>Love the fact that it&#x27;s unscented and holds great.</li>
      <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be buying it again when I need more!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not sticky, holds good and smells good(but nothing strong)!</li>
      <li>This works great (light hold) and has no fragrance.</li>
      <li>and she liked it.</li>
      <li>Best of all, it&#x27;s not trashing my hair and it&#x27;s a natural product.</li>
      <li>So, I bought a cheap bottle of Tresame (travel size), emptied out the contents, washed out the bottle and filled it with the Lily stuff and it works great for me.</li>
      <li>This has a nice easy hold</li>
      <li>My daughter loves it :) recommend it</li>
      <li>Gives a nice light hold.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier :-)</li>
      <li>I prefer a more diffuse spray.  </li>
      <li>&quot; but it&#x27;s able to hold my hair and keep it from frizzing</li>
      <li>It works ok.  </li>
      <li>It holds and is healthy for your hair.</li>
      <li>I love this spray.  </li>
      <li>This is the most non-toxic hairspray that I could find.</li>
      <li>many out of my community, called canaries have given up styling their hair or using cosmetic products altogether.</li>
      <li>Most hairsprays bother my eyes, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Love this product, use it all the time.</li>
      <li>I am so glad they make an unscented styling spray.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and have been using it for years.  </li>
      <li>more sticky than I figured it would be</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>but I am really happy so far!</li>
      <li>All caracteristics of the product are very good and are nothing different to what is advertised.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to wash out of my hair and it also keep my hair neat.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve looked for this exact hair spray as it&#x27;s always been kind to my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>Use a light spray for light hold and a heavier spray for a tighter hold.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try this as it is alcohol free.  </li>
      <li>As a finishing spray, hold container 6-8 inches away from hair and spray lightly.</li>
      <li>I needed a product that is fragrance free and holds my hair.  </li>
      <li>Holds the hair in place in a smooth way</li>
      <li>This is for people who need a light spray.  </li>
      <li>And I was concerned of the lack of hold as I have whispy super fine hair that fans out on the sides and under pony tails.  </li>
      <li>I love this spray, very light with no fragrance, gives natural hold to prevent flyaways.  </li>
      <li>if you can and are just finicky then count yourself fortunate, thank your lucky stars and use this anyway.</li>
      <li>, ACV rinses, special shampoos, etc.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice hold but its not stiff.</li>
      <li>Love it :) it defiantly works for thin hair and it smells good .</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of options since I am sensitive to many chemicals in the hair</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s natural; easy residue to clean off surfaces.</li>
      <li>By the way, I looked up PVP as another reviewer suggested, and EWG lists it as a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34;, safe natural ingredient.  </li>
      <li>my hair is left kind of tacky feeling.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love this stuff for when I put up my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s hair or even to tame flyaways.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different hair sprays, organic or \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and I like this one the best.</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>believe me i have researched high and low and even made my own product out of gelaton, sugar water, you name it.</li>
      <li>Natural, smells light and neutral.</li>
      <li>Very helpful product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d never use a real hairspray on her!</li>
      <li>I love this spray because it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol and alternate between the Aubrey one.</li>
      <li>It also gives a little nice shine on the hair.</li>
      <li>I use it very often.</li>
      <li>One thing I don&#x27;t like too much though is the way the pump sprayer works.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted this to work, as I&#x27;m looking for these type of products without all those chemicals.  </li>
      <li>This one really fills the bill.</li>
      <li>Look more carefully at the ingredients.</li>
      <li>if you absolutely cannot tolerate anything else this is for you.</li>
      <li>In fact, my hair seems to really like it.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for something to put on your fine dry hair after styling, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
      <li>I have actually had one full day with NO irritation at all.  </li>
      <li>Quality is high.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I was a little concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t have the holding power like most hairsprays, but it did not disappoint.</li>
      <li>I am chemically sensitive and this has no irritating elements.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not looking for helmet-head but just a little something to hold a touch of body in my straight fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I live in GA</li>
      <li>She has fine hair with a slight wave.</li>
      <li>Yet, I have come to the conclusion that my hair just doesn&#x27;t really care for aloe vera in general whether it is aloe vera juice or gel.</li>
      <li>So, if you hair tolerates aloe vera perhaps this will work for you, but for me it was a great disappointment.</li>
      <li>Contains natural ingredients that don&#x27;t make you itch or flaky or asthmatic.</li>
      <li>I like the feel of my hair after using this product, but I am looking for an organic, chemical-free product like this one that offers a firmer hold.</li>
      <li>It is completely all-natural and that is why I bought it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s enough to hold the hair, yet not too much.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and need something that will hold the curl and help prevent frizz.</li>
      <li>I use it on myself and also my 2 year old&#x27;s wayward hairs as I&#x27;m putting her hair up.</li>
      <li>makes your hair look naturally shiny</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s 100% natural.</li>
      <li>The directions on the back are \\&quot;For styling apply to clean wet hair.  </li>
      <li>It has worked with my fine, straight, thin hair.  </li>
      <li>I have thick hair and his is fine textured.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have become very sensitive to perfumes and chemicals, and it is hard to find personal products that work for me.  This one really fills the bill. NO perfume-smell, and it holds the hairstyle well. Very helpful product!</li>
    <li> for a chemically sensitive person who has no opportunity to use hair spray products at all but needs some assistance in styling i have found this to be my only choice. believe me i have researched high and low and even made my own product out of gelaton, sugar water, you name it. many out of my community, called canaries have given up styling their hair or using cosmetic products altogether. i can do quite a lot with what i&#x27;ve got. yes, it&#x27;s a bit drying but you do what you gotta do in dire circumstances. if you absolutely cannot tolerate anything else this is for you. if you can and are just finicky then count yourself fortunate, thank your lucky stars and use this anyway. quit polluting the environment for all our sakes.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that it&#x27;s unscented and holds great. And does not &amp;#34;glue,&amp;#34; so it actually goes away when I just comb my hair.</li>
    <li> For some odd reason, when I use this it leaves my hair feeling dry, which is odd because it&#x27;s supposed to have aloe.  Even if I rinse (not shampoo) my hair is left kind of tacky feeling.  It works ok.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of options since I am sensitive to many chemicals in the hair sprays out there, so it works.  Not great, but ok.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different hair sprays, organic or \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and I like this one the best. It&#x27;s not sticky, holds good and smells good(but nothing strong)! I have long curly hair and this doesnt make my hair \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; but it&#x27;s able to hold my hair and keep it from frizzing</li>
    <li> I cannot tolerate fragrances and this spray is perfect for me.  I&#x27;m not looking for helmet-head but just a little something to hold a touch of body in my straight fine hair.  This is working well for me.</li>
    <li> This works great (light hold) and has no fragrance. Most hairsprays bother my eyes, but this one doesn&#x27;t. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for years.  I am chemically sensitive and this has no irritating elements.  Use a light spray for light hold and a heavier spray for a tighter hold.  I used to breathe in other sprays and feel like I just inhaled a chemical factory.  One thing I don&#x27;t like too much though is the way the pump sprayer works.  The spray-line is a bit too concentrated, meaning it can all end up in one are of your hair.  I prefer a more diffuse spray.  So, I bought a cheap bottle of Tresame (travel size), emptied out the contents, washed out the bottle and filled it with the Lily stuff and it works great for me.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find an alcohol free hair spray...but this is it.  It holds and is healthy for your hair.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of my hair after using this product, but I am looking for an organic, chemical-free product like this one that offers a firmer hold.</li>
    <li> makes your hair look naturally shiny and it&#x27;s 100% natural. If I had longer hair I would buy this product again</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from scalp issues for months after an illness and a lot of stress.  Not sure if it is sebbhoriac dermatitis or allergies or just a stress reaction.  I&#x27;ve done the nightly oils, ACV rinses, special shampoos, etc.  I noticed it was worse after hairspray - like areas of my scalp were on itchy fire!  At my wits end I switched hairspray brands a few times.  I decided to try this as it is alcohol free.  2 days in and I can say THANK GOODNESS!!  I have actually had one full day with NO irritation at all.  In fact, my hair seems to really like it.  And I was concerned of the lack of hold as I have whispy super fine hair that fans out on the sides and under pony tails.  I have to have hairspray!  This has a nice easy hold and I still look good at the end of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to jinx anything - but I am really happy so far!</li>
    <li> This product is the BEST styling spray I have EVER used.  Hairsprays, in general, are sticky, stiff,  have a sweet sickening scent, all of which dry hair out,etc.  Lily of the Dessert is unscented so it doesn&#x27;t clash with perfume, does NOT choke you with sticky fog, does not dry your hair out, nor make it stiff as cardboard.  I, seriously, buy this stuff in multiples...10 or 12 at a time.  I will never use \\&quot;hairspray\\&quot;, again!  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> All caracteristics of the product are very good and are nothing different to what is advertised. Holds the hair in place in a smooth way</li>
    <li> Love this product, use it all the time.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my fine hair. A lot comes out with each spray. I will not buy again</li>
    <li> I like it. It has a nice hold but its not stiff. This product I would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 3 2 1</li>
    <li> Not too good for holding your style, but it does make my hair shine.</li>
    <li> Bought this because my roommate has allergies to odors. It works great, holds nicely, doesn&#x27;t have a scent, and it isn&#x27;t sticky. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this on a daily basis and just loves it.  It is unscented and is not an aerosol.  It sprays the liquid on.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> I love this spray.  I needed a product that is fragrance free and holds my hair.  It has worked with my fine, straight, thin hair.  It is just what I needed.  It also helps get rid of tangles in my hair.  I am so glad they make an unscented styling spray.  It is hard to find any styling products that are fragrance free.  This is my 2nd bottle, and I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> What can I say? It works, it doesn&#x27;t stink, it doesn&#x27;t make me feel all sticky but it holds my hair in place and keeps the flyaways at bay when I pull my hair into a pony tail. Best of all, it&#x27;s not trashing my hair and it&#x27;s a natural product. I couldn&#x27;t be happier :-) I&#x27;ll be buying it again when I need more!</li>
    <li> Contains natural ingredients that don&#x27;t make you itch or flaky or asthmatic. The only negative thing I&#x27;ve found is that my bathroom floor is sticky where I&#x27;ve sprayed my hair. Good thing it&#x27;s natural; easy residue to clean off surfaces.</li>
    <li> more sticky than I figured it would be</li>
    <li> I love this spray because it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol and alternate between the Aubrey one. It doesn&#x27;t last as long, only one day but it&#x27;s not as drying.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff for when I put up my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s hair or even to tame flyaways. She has fine hair with a slight wave.It is completely all-natural and that is why I bought it. I was a little concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t have the holding power like most hairsprays, but it did not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I have 4c hair. I had heard aloe vera was good for your hair, so I decided to give this product a try. After the first use, my hair felt incredibly dry - so dry that I just gave up and had to rewash my hair the same day. I have tried other aloe vera products since then thinking perhaps it was just this product. Yet, I have come to the conclusion that my hair just doesn&#x27;t really care for aloe vera in general whether it is aloe vera juice or gel. So, if you hair tolerates aloe vera perhaps this will work for you, but for me it was a great disappointment.</li>
    <li> This styling spray feels really good. I like it. The smell is pleasant. It&#x27;s enough to hold the hair, yet not too much. It also gives a little nice shine on the hair. It doesn&#x27;t sting my skin like other hair spray I used before, since there is no alcohol in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Look more carefully at the ingredients. Some longish names. And PVP. A chemical. Some people are greatly allergic. Look it up.</li>
    <li> This is the most non-toxic hairspray that I could find. I have naturally curly hair and need something that will hold the curl and help prevent frizz. This does alright, but is not a super hold. I live in GA so we have a lot of humidity here too. It also makes me cough after I spray it so it does have something in the ingredients that is a respiratory irritant. It is not sticky or flaky. It washes out well.</li>
    <li> Natural, smells light and neutral. Gives a nice light hold. I use it on myself and also my 2 year old&#x27;s wayward hairs as I&#x27;m putting her hair up. I&#x27;d never use a real hairspray on her!</li>
    <li> I like the product but it&#x27;s  very small bottle .</li>
    <li> I like it very much. I use it very often. Quality is high. I am recommending it one. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love it :) it defiantly works for thin hair and it smells good . My daughter loves it :) recommend it</li>
    <li> This is for people who need a light spray.  Having said that,  I gave it to someone with heavier use needs and she liked it. I chose it because, of all the sprays in the natural food store, it was the only one that didn&#x27;t overwhelm me with fumes.  I&#x27;m so happy I can order it from Amazon, because I buy it by the dozen.  And I&#x27;m so sick of arguing withe store about ordering it for me.</li>
    <li> Love it! Does not leave your hair tacky and sticky.. I could still shake my hair but maintain the hold. It is natral and good for your hair. I reccomend it for African American hair.</li>
    <li> This hairspray doesn&#x27;t work.  It has no &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s basically worthless.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I love this spray, very light with no fragrance, gives natural hold to prevent flyaways.  My husband uses it too and loves it.  I have thick hair and his is fine textured.  Please everyone try it, &#x27;cause I want Lily of the Desert to keep making this forever!  By the way, I looked up PVP as another reviewer suggested, and EWG lists it as a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34;, safe natural ingredient.  Beats rubbing aloe gel into my hands and running through my hair like I used to do.</li>
    <li> The directions on the back are \\&quot;For styling apply to clean wet hair.  As a finishing spray, hold container 6-8 inches away from hair and spray lightly. Allow to dry naturally.\\&quot;  I&#x27;m confused, as I wouldn&#x27;t usually apply hairspray to wet hair.  I have fine hair and I decided to use it anyway on my dry hair.  It weighed it down and it clumped in some places.  I really wanted this to work, as I&#x27;m looking for these type of products without all those chemicals.  I&#x27;m giving it two stars because I didn&#x27;t follow directions and it may work great otherwise.  If you are looking for something to put on your fine dry hair after styling, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked for this exact hair spray as it&#x27;s always been kind to my hair.  It&#x27;s easy to wash out of my hair and it also keep my hair neat.</li>
