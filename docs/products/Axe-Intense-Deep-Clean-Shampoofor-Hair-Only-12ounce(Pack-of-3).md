### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>In my opinion, this is the very best shampoo that&#x27;s ever been made for thoroughly cleaning oily hair.  </li>
      <li>This order consists of 3 bottles, 12 ounces each, of the best shampoo I have found.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s about the best I can describe.  </li>
      <li>This is a very good shampoo for me....</li>
      <li>The product is very good and deserves 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>pros, works great on hair    cons</li>
      <li>i then thought to myself, thinking that shampoo for men would do me good, because the mens shampoo has alot of products for oily hair.</li>
      <li>Works good for me.</li>
      <li>When I contacted Unilever some months ago on this matter, they told me that they discontinued this amazing shampoo as it just wasn&#x27;t selling in sufficient numbers to keep production going forward.  </li>
      <li>A nice but not overbearing scent/</li>
      <li>and I love, love it!  </li>
      <li>, Otherwise I would NOT have ordered from them, when they are more expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>More like a gel than a glue to me.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It smells great and leaves my hair feeling clean and soft.</li>
      <li>The Intense Deglue shampoo has a kind of industrial lime smell to it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve now bought the remaining stock of Axe Intense Deep Clean Shampoo on Amazon, which will give me superb hair until my supply runs out.  </li>
      <li>As a man I highly recommend this great shampoo to any man who has oily hair and wants it fully cleansed.</li>
      <li>and it gets my hair squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair squeaky clean</li>
      <li>I would rather get my hair that clean every time I shower.</li>
      <li>Oh it&#x27;s the right one!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had oily hair my entire life, and have tried every available shampoo to effectively deal with it  </li>
      <li>Regular Axe Snake Peel works better and smells better, too.  </li>
      <li>I have tried the one in the picture and absolutely love the product, but the one that they sent me does not have the crystals that it states that it does and does not work near as good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am also using this as a body scrub and my husband has been commenting on how \\&quot;fresh and clean\\&quot; I smell.  </li>
      <li>I do work on cars and can get my hair pretty full of dirt/grease, and I think I will stick to dishwashing liquid soap (i.e. Dawn) when it is that bad.&lt;br</li>
      <li>have not talked to the company or given them a chance to make it right.</li>
      <li>only reason why I gave it two stars was the fact that AXE is a good product all in all, even if this isn&#x27;t the best on the market, but the seller is misleading us on by stating that you will receive 6 bottles when indeed they only sent three and then sent the wrong item on top of it all.</li>
      <li>It is not very thick and glue-like or very concentrated, and ironically, I found it did not do a very good job at cleaning/breaking down grease/oil.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used most of the Axe shampoos/conditioners, and this is definitely different.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Ordinarily, I love Axe products and enjoy the variety -- even just for the sake of variety, but this is the first in a long while that I actually regretted purchasing.</li>
      <li>Great for cleaning up after a hard day of work out in the garage!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really clean better and is more difficult to fully rinse out.  </li>
      <li>leaves my hair very clean &amp; dry.  </li>
      <li>The AXE INTENSE DE-GLUE SHAMPOO has scrubbing beads in it.</li>
      <li>I have very oily hair and shampoo every day.  </li>
      <li>I paid just as much in shipping as I did for the product.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast with Amazon Prime.</li>
      <li>Axe de-glue shampoo works very well.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and item was packed well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, it cleans really well and gets out all the gunk from styling products and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Listed as and had the picture of: \\&quot;4 of: Axe Intense Deglue Shampoo, 12 Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3)\\&quot;</li>
      <li>And I wonder how many people lay dead on the floor because of not fulfilling the order right?</li>
      <li>I think this shampoo is too rough for daily use, but good for a thorough twice-weekly clean if you work out regularly.</li>
      <li>I thought all hope was lost until I discovered Axe Intense Deep Clean Shampoo years ago.  </li>
      <li>I did not expect it to be luxurious like many other shampoos/gels, and it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I even called the company first because I knew they were changing formulas, and was told they had stock of the old formula</li>
      <li>, comercials are lying that it will attract females if you start using axe(I only threw that in for fun)</li>
      <li>Which has scrubber beads and worked well on my hair, However what they sent me was: \\&quot;Axe Intense Deep Clean Shampoo,for Hair Only \\&quot;</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be surprised by the grit in it!  </li>
      <li>Apparently by not including the phrase &amp;#34;+ hair scrub&amp;#34; there are, in fact, two (2) versions of the Axe Intense Deep Clean Shampoo ~~ 1 without the &amp;#34;hair scrub&amp;#34; and 1 (another) with, but having, up to this point only ever seen, purchased, or even been aware of 2 versions, I assumed by copying the name directly from the old bottle for my Google searches would be sufficient and that I had found and I would receive the ONLY product I was aware bearing this name.</li>
      <li>only a little squirt gives you a lot of lather, and it has that fresh and clean scent that seems to be in all AXE</li>
      <li>It is actually the &amp;#34;Hair Scrub&amp;#34; that has drawn me to the shampoo and the reason I keep using it and placed a large order as I cannot always find it on retail shelves.</li>
      <li>This AXE Deep Clean Shampoo allows me to go 3 to 4 days before I need to rewash my long hair.</li>
      <li>AXE commercials are funny and border on stupid, but their products are pretty good.</li>
      <li>It leaves our hair super-clean, shiny, soft, and flowing with tons of volume.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it might make a good shower gel based on its similarity to Snake Peel, however, it failed there, too.  </li>
      <li>I expected a little more being I paid 10.00 in shipping.</li>
      <li>I did not find that it broke down oils very well.  </li>

<li> My teenage son has long Fabio-type hair and he swears by this product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They have changed this. No longer does this shampoo have the micro beads in it. It&#x27;s basically just a shampoo NOT a hair scrub.</li>
    <li> I think this shampoo is too rough for daily use, but good for a thorough twice-weekly clean if you work out regularly.</li>
    <li> Axe de-glue shampoo works very well. It cleans deep in my scalp to get rid of dandruff and oil. I love it. Shipped fast with Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> My teenage son has long Fabio-type hair and he swears by this product.  I decided to try it on my very long hair and I love, love it!  It leaves our hair super-clean, shiny, soft, and flowing with tons of volume.  I use it every day and have got nothing but compliments.  I am also using this as a body scrub and my husband has been commenting on how \\&quot;fresh and clean\\&quot; I smell.  Can&#x27;t beat that...</li>
    <li> Purchased this because my local chain stopped carrying it. Works good for me.</li>
    <li> Yes I am a women who is using this product, i ran into this at a local shop intown, because i ran out of something else i had.  Looked in the aisle to see if i can find the shampoo i needed, but they ran out. i then thought to myself, thinking that shampoo for men would do me good, because the mens shampoo has alot of products for oily hair. so i decided to try this Axe products, and found it working in my hair, is also smells like irish springs soap.    pros, works great on hair    cons, comercials are lying that it will attract females if you start using axe(I only threw that in for fun)</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo hoping that it was what it said under the description and the bottle that is shown. It shows one bottle, but in turn they sent three different bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That wasn&#x27;t even the worse part about it, the worst part of it was that it even states under the description that it has 6 12 ounce bottles and they come in a 3 pack like I have bought them before on Amazon&#x27;s website, and yet they sent something totally different and only sent three of them. I have tried the one in the picture and absolutely love the product, but the one that they sent me does not have the crystals that it states that it does and does not work near as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I gave it two stars was the fact that AXE is a good product all in all, even if this isn&#x27;t the best on the market, but the seller is misleading us on by stating that you will receive 6 bottles when indeed they only sent three and then sent the wrong item on top of it all. I have never been so disappointed in all my life by the fact that I was given a double whammy I guess you could say. I will not be doing business with this sell ever again that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been in contact with Amazon and they told me to send the seller Pharmapacks, an email and see if they will try to fix it, but I am just trying to save someone else from this same issue that they put me through. If you aren&#x27;t going to deliver an item as it states and shows on Amazon&#x27;s website, then don&#x27;t bother even putting a picture or a description at all. Just leave it blank and that way \\&quot;We\\&quot; as consumers can basically expect to just get anything that comes to us.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to read a review stating that this shampoo is thick like glue. To me, it is no thicker than any other AXE shampoo. More like a gel than a glue to me. It smells great and leaves my hair feeling clean and soft. I use it daily without any issues. Despite the \\&quot;deep clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;de-glue\\&quot; labels on the bottle, there is no reason not to use this on a daily basis if you wanted to. Seems silly to me to only \\&quot;deep clean\\&quot; your hair twice a month or so. I would rather get my hair that clean every time I shower.</li>
    <li> The AXE INTENSE DE-GLUE SHAMPOO has scrubbing beads in it. This is the first shampoo that I&#x27;ve encountered with micro beads to exfoliate your scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s green and pretty thick, so only a little squirt gives you a lot of lather, and it has that fresh and clean scent that seems to be in all AXE products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it cleans really well and gets out all the gunk from styling products and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AXE commercials are funny and border on stupid, but their products are pretty good. I also like [[ASIN:B001FSK8SK Axe Whatever Messy Look Paste, 2.64-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)]] and/or [[ASIN:B001FSK8SA Axe Refined Clean-cut Look Pomade, 2.64-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)]].</li>
    <li> The product is very good and deserves 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**beware of the (pack of three).  We only got 1.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I known the price was for one bottle I would have looked elsewhere.  Shipping was fast and item was packed well.  If I could give the company stars, I&#x27;d give them a 1 for being misleading.  Not a way to get my business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not talked to the company or given them a chance to make it right.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware ... misled.  This product is not the advertised formula with rock crystals, which is why I purchased it.  It is just regular shampoo &amp;#34;for oily hair.&amp;#34;  Apparently AXE has changed the formula ... however the description plainly mentions the rock crystals which helped &amp;#34;deglue&amp;#34; your hair from pomade products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy from this seller ...</li>
    <li> This order consists of 3 bottles, 12 ounces each, of the best shampoo I have found. My hair is down to the middle of my back and I had to wash it every other day due to the oiliness that my hair becomes in one to one - and - a - half days. This AXE Deep Clean Shampoo allows me to go 3 to 4 days before I need to rewash my long hair. As a man I highly recommend this great shampoo to any man who has oily hair and wants it fully cleansed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had oily hair my entire life, and have tried every available shampoo to effectively deal with it  I thought all hope was lost until I discovered Axe Intense Deep Clean Shampoo years ago.  This shampoo was a literal miracle for me, as it&#x27;s the ONLY one that thoroughly cleans my hair, stripping the excess oil from it.  In my opinion, this is the very best shampoo that&#x27;s ever been made for thoroughly cleaning oily hair.  When I recently learned that this shampoo had been discontinued, I was very disappointed, as there isn&#x27;t anything equivalent out there.  I&#x27;ve now bought the remaining stock of Axe Intense Deep Clean Shampoo on Amazon, which will give me superb hair until my supply runs out.  When I contacted Unilever some months ago on this matter, they told me that they discontinued this amazing shampoo as it just wasn&#x27;t selling in sufficient numbers to keep production going forward.  It was a very sad day for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is designed for removing excessive styling aids. However, what it also excels at removing is gear oil, axle grease, coolant and anything else that will drip/fall off of the underside of a vehicle while you&#x27;re working on it.  Great for cleaning up after a hard day of work out in the garage!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting 13 days(excluding Sundays) for this shampoo. I paid just as much in shipping as I did for the product. I informed Amazon about this issue and I was told the independent seller AmericaRX has shipped it. I&#x27;ve been tracking it and has been sent through 4 different city in CA via UPS. Now they transferred from UPS to USPS somewhere in CA and is no longer to track. I expected a little more being I paid 10.00 in shipping. But now it&#x27;s somewhere unknown. Save yourself the trouble and purchase elsewhere. No one should have to wait that long.</li>
    <li> The shampoo I received was NOT actually what I thought I ordered. Apparently by not including the phrase &amp;#34;+ hair scrub&amp;#34; there are, in fact, two (2) versions of the Axe Intense Deep Clean Shampoo ~~ 1 without the &amp;#34;hair scrub&amp;#34; and 1 (another) with, but having, up to this point only ever seen, purchased, or even been aware of 2 versions, I assumed by copying the name directly from the old bottle for my Google searches would be sufficient and that I had found and I would receive the ONLY product I was aware bearing this name. It is actually the &amp;#34;Hair Scrub&amp;#34; that has drawn me to the shampoo and the reason I keep using it and placed a large order as I cannot always find it on retail shelves.</li>
    <li> Although not marked as &amp;#34;for oily hair,&amp;#34; this deep cleaning product seems to have no oily conditioner in it and it gets my hair squeaky clean. A nice but not overbearing scent/ I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Listed as and had the picture of: \\&quot;4 of: Axe Intense Deglue Shampoo, 12 Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3)\\&quot; Which has scrubber beads and worked well on my hair, However what they sent me was: \\&quot;Axe Intense Deep Clean Shampoo,for Hair Only \\&quot;, I even called the company first because I knew they were changing formulas, and was told they had stock of the old formula and that&#x27;s what they would be sending, Otherwise I would NOT have ordered from them, when they are more expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a question since AmericaRx is a pharmacy and deals with prescriptions, I wonder how many times they sent out the wrong  prescription, and when called they just said, Oh it&#x27;s the right one! And I wonder how many people lay dead on the floor because of not fulfilling the order right? Just saying.</li>
    <li> I have very oily hair and shampoo every day.  This is a very good shampoo for me....leaves my hair very clean &amp; dry.  Don&#x27;t be surprised by the grit in it!  Suppose it helps scrub the hair.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair squeaky clean</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used most of the Axe shampoos/conditioners, and this is definitely different.  It is not very thick and glue-like or very concentrated, and ironically, I found it did not do a very good job at cleaning/breaking down grease/oil.  What is really weird is that it contains a rather coarse pumice \\&quot;rock crystals\\&quot; similar to (but more coarse) than the shower gel Snake Peel, if you&#x27;ve used that.  It&#x27;s sort of like getting sand in your hair.  It doesn&#x27;t really clean better and is more difficult to fully rinse out.  I do work on cars and can get my hair pretty full of dirt/grease, and I think I will stick to dishwashing liquid soap (i.e. Dawn) when it is that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it might make a good shower gel based on its similarity to Snake Peel, however, it failed there, too.  I did not find that it broke down oils very well.  Additionally, it seemed to react with things like leftover deodorant and become a sticky compound mess rather than dissolve it.  Regular Axe Snake Peel works better and smells better, too.  The Intense Deglue shampoo has a kind of industrial lime smell to it.  That&#x27;s about the best I can describe.  It is a clear green liquid.  I did not expect it to be luxurious like many other shampoos/gels, and it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordinarily, I love Axe products and enjoy the variety -- even just for the sake of variety, but this is the first in a long while that I actually regretted purchasing.</li>
