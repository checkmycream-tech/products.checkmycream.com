      <li>So far so good........</li>
      <li>Noticed scalp showing more, mom tried according to instructions, started seeing results after first month.</li>
      <li>you are NOT getting the full content of the product in the bottles, therefore you can&#x27;t apply full coverage.</li>
      <li>I have used several of the Keranique Products and have been very satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>Mine is because I became a vegan and did not realize that I was depriving parts of my body the right nutrition.</li>
      <li>I have not noticed a change in my hair, and I held the bottles up to the light and they are only filled halfway.</li>
      <li>Hog wash, started using this when first came out.</li>
      <li>I have to use it some more to actually get the result I am looking for.</li>

      <li>This product really works.  </li>
      <li>but since i just started using it so, &amp; don&#x27;t really know whether it works or</li>
      <li>My hair was thicker on the right side, so I concentrated the application to the left.  </li>
      <li>I saw new growth after one week.</li>
      <li>I have used different types of hair regrowth for 2 years, and this really has helped the regrowth and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This product comes in nice little single applications.</li>
      <li>There was no visible result derived from using this product so do not waste your money buying this item from Keranique.</li>
      <li>After 3 consecutive months of use, hair shows big difference, not nearly as thin anymore.</li>
      <li>Bought this set thinking, it&#x27;s different, only 8 days every other month, better if used every month.</li>
      <li>I do know that after I applied the product, it left my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>Still nothing, but turns my blonde hair a nice shade of pale green.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a product that would jump start the regrowth process I gave it time as recommended but was disappointed to see a great deal of hair loss shortly after using the product.  </li>

<li> Waste of time and money!</li>
<li> Not only is it expensive</li>
<li> Disappointed and wish had money back.</li>
<li> thin hair and feel like my pony tail got thicker</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I saw new growth after one week.</li>
    <li> I am nit sure what they are doing but I started the process and time will tell. I do know that after I applied the product, it left my hair very soft and manageable. I am hoping for the best. So far so good........</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I can tell the different in the texture of my hair.  I fully suggest purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Everyone is looking for these Miracle cures to everything....this did not say you would have overnight hair growth or thickness. I have used several of the Keranique Products and have been very satisfied with the results. Along with using this product you should use the shampoo and conditioner and the volume spray. Great results. Another thing people need to understand is the reason for their hair loss. Mine is because I became a vegan and did not realize that I was depriving parts of my body the right nutrition. I had Fibroids and my thyroids were all wishy washy. So before you judge to quickly think of all of the other things that are causing your thin hair and stop all this hope for miracle cures and give the product a chance.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed a change in my hair, and I held the bottles up to the light and they are only filled halfway. Not only is it expensive you are NOT getting the full content of the product in the bottles, therefore you can&#x27;t apply full coverage.</li>
    <li> Bought this set thinking, it&#x27;s different, only 8 days every other month, better if used every month. Hog wash, started using this when first came out. Still nothing, but turns my blonde hair a nice shade of pale green.</li>
    <li> there wasn&#x27;t even half a product in that minuscule vial,so i give it 2 stars. but since i just started using it so, &amp; don&#x27;t really know whether it works or not so just added one more star to it.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews (and yes I know they were mixed) ... I was hoping on the optimistic side so I purchased the product. However, I am sad to say that wasn&#x27;t my experience. I used the product as directed and saw no visible difference.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!  Hair feels fuller and thicker after first use.  I love it.  Should be in salons everywhere.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product now for three (3) months- once a month treatment.  My hair was thicker on the right side, so I concentrated the application to the left.  I have noticed that my hair is healthier and has grown on that side. Once a month application has proven to work</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  It seems like such a tiny amount but it does a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> Best used in combo with the shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a product that would jump start the regrowth process I gave it time as recommended but was disappointed to see a great deal of hair loss shortly after using the product.  I will continue to use all the other products but this one</li>
    <li> This really worked great with the hair regrowth treatment and I can finally see a difference with the thinning of my hair. I have used different types of hair regrowth for 2 years, and this really has helped the regrowth and I highly recommend it. Thanks Lisa</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in the results of using your product, Have not noticed any improvement wit the hair.If it would accomplish the things it says in the ad , the product would fly of the shelves.And advertisement would not be nessesary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next step for me is a consultation with a dermotaligist.</li>
    <li> Great product.....feels like it is working. Time will tell</li>
    <li> This product comes in nice little single applications. But you can get the same substance for $19 at WalMart.</li>
    <li> Didnt work.at all. Bought rogaine and tbat works. Disappointed and wish had money back. Maybe will wprk for someone else.</li>
    <li> Waste of time and money!</li>
    <li> New growth appeared rather quickly.</li>
