      <li>and I thought I would get more sun protection.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I could find some on Amazon before I have to go out and find something else to replace it.</li>
      <li>Skin is not 35 anymore but pretty good for 58.</li>
      <li>Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging DNA cream has improved the discolored appearance a lot and it has 30 SPF sunscreen in it to prevent sun damage all day without a layer of sun screen on top of it.  </li>
      <li>This is smooth and I love the fact that it has SPF30, which is recommended amount of SPF.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a nice moisturizer with a fairly high SPF and ever since I was a child (many moons ago) my mother relied on Olay products, at that time the spelling was Oley (see how looooonnnnng ago that was:-)</li>
      <li>I have always liked Olay for the quality of the products and the reasonable prices.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and I can tell a difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product under my makeup and my skin feels light and protected.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s so important here in Florida.</li>
      <li>Quite light.</li>
      <li>so far so good</li>
      <li>really is the best lotion I have used in a very long time!</li>
      <li>this is great for dry sking</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t be a problem since I use it twice a day, but it would have been nice to know I was purchasing something so close to the expiration date prior.</li>
      <li>, i just used it 2 times, my skin feels hydrated and not to greasy , does the job , i will add more if i see positive changes</li>
      <li>I tried the Oil of Olay per the advice of my beautiful mother &amp; was very happily surprised to see the same results for a much more affordable price.</li>
      <li>I spent 9 days in the sun on vacation and this protected my face great.</li>
      <li>I wanted something to bring on vacation with sunscreen and this wasn&#x27;t only a good protectant</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to pay full price for it because P&amp;G makes them in Asia.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this lotion for years and love the weight and the high SPF.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and really does get rid of fine lines.</li>
      <li>This cream is quickly absorbed into your face.</li>
      <li>Still it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I have always liked Olay products and especially the regenerist line of products.</li>
      <li>I have tried many, many, many more expensive brands.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ll be able to give more glowing reports in a few weeks when I&#x27;m looking even younger  :-)</li>
      <li>I love Olay products and since I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;i used other creams w/ SPF and the good ones ( shesheido SPF18 )</li>
      <li>This works ok, haven&#x27;t  major results.</li>
      <li>If I am super gentle when applying I can minimize the irritation.</li>
      <li>It works great and is comparable to the more expensive department store brands.</li>
      <li>I had a problem with the 1st order and the Seller was ever so kind as to reorder and send me another of the same product which worked very well for me.</li>
      <li>Have used it for years, need a higher SPF while living</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t as wet as allot of moisturizers, which is nice.  </li>
      <li>I truly love this product especially with the SPF30.</li>
      <li>First I will admit that I&#x27;m a man in my 50&#x27;s and have worked in the sun a lot over the years...</li>
      <li>I love the entire regenerist line!  </li>
      <li>My favorite facial moisturizer;; added bonus is the syn protection.</li>
      <li>I bought my first one in March and am still using it.</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>or so I look as though I am ready to be fried!  </li>
      <li>I love the product and it works well for me, it keeps my face soft and young and it came in time</li>
      <li>One of the many reasons I continue to use this product is  because it absorbs really well into my skin and is one of the few products available with SPF 30.</li>
      <li>This product goes on smoothly, does not have any unpleasant odor, and makes my skin look very good.</li>
      <li>My skin feels fully moisturized and super soft.</li>
      <li>In Australia, it&#x27;s extremely pricey, about AU$50 and about $30 when it&#x27;s on special so this price from ShopCrazy is extremely cheap.</li>
      <li>It is also very greasy.</li>
      <li>Dont really like the dispenser.</li>
      <li>This product can really help repair damage in regards to any sort of scars you may have.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing for me</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m back to the original and just use the thicker DNA cream on my hands until the bottle is used up.</li>
      <li>Totally amazed with the prompt and friendly communication from &amp;#34;ShopCrazy&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I have had the \\&quot;flake off\\&quot; problem with many other products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This works ok, haven&#x27;t  major results.</li>
    <li> it is a heavy cream, my skin is oily, so didnot do well. i had to return it.</li>
    <li> It was a present for my daughter in australia and she was delighted  with it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;m not totally wowed by it and I don&#x27;t think its moisturizing, but I do like the spf protection.</li>
    <li> Best Prices and speedy delivery</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this item 5 stars was it expires before the end of the year. I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t be a problem since I use it twice a day, but it would have been nice to know I was purchasing something so close to the expiration date prior. It think next time I&#x27;ll just pick it up at Costco since it works out to about the same price.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff and have been using it for the last four years.....now, I think they discontinued it!??</li>
    <li> Too thick and oily for my skin!</li>
    <li> Feels excellent and ingredient wise, seems to combine everything: antioxidant anti ageing and sun protection.</li>
    <li> A wonderful cream with sunscreen.  Will buy again and highly recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> My favorite facial moisturizer;; added bonus is the syn protection.</li>
    <li> This product reminds me of sun tan lotion.  Which I guess it is.  Would be good for day wear.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing for me but I do not have dry skin; I have what they call as the cosmetics counter \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin.  The UV protection is awesome and I use it on my inner elbows (car sun) and shoulders and neck too.  Get compliments on my skin daily and I am 53.</li>
    <li> Expiration date was within a month of purchase. I assume it&#x27;s been at the sellers for a long time and they are trying to get rid of it. Not sure how it will affect the cream, I guess the SPF will not work any more.</li>
    <li> I really like this product for the extra sun screen protection (30 spf) without feeling greasy. It absorbs just Iike lotion. I never have any breakouts or problems with this stuff. I like Olay products in general.  I have been buying this product at drug stores for quite sometime and have paying quite a bit more. I put this on every morning.This was a great deal!</li>
    <li> I &#x27;m disappointed to got a nearly expired one, only 2 months left, maybe the retailer want me use it day and night.</li>
    <li> Just bought this. It expires in 2 months. Rip off!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a nice moisturizer with a fairly high SPF and ever since I was a child (many moons ago) my mother relied on Olay products, at that time the spelling was Oley (see how looooonnnnng ago that was:-) anyhow I now prefer to use Olay even though I&#x27;ve tried some of the more expensive products Olay works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this a few days ago with Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Night Resurfacing Elixir and so far my face has been feeling really smooth. I don&#x27;t know if it is my imagination but I find that my skin feels tighter and smoother. I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ll be able to give more glowing reports in a few weeks when I&#x27;m looking even younger  :-) A girl can dream can&#x27;t I :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I truly recommend it to all of you ladies out there 55 years and up.</li>
    <li> Olay is the best of all the skin care products I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s not greasy and really does get rid of fine lines.</li>
    <li> this is great for dry sking</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and they have quit making it. I am so glad I could find some on Amazon before I have to go out and find something else to replace it.</li>
    <li> I mix it together with my foundation then apply to my face. Use it almost everyday. Great product especially for a good price.</li>
    <li> This is a very thick cream and goes on smoothly. My skin feels fully moisturized and super soft. I think I will be buying this one over and over.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with higher SPF.  Have used it for years, need a higher SPF while living&lt;br /&gt;Ng in the tropics.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t as wet as allot of moisturizers, which is nice.  It goes on smooth and I can tell a difference in my skin.  It does last a long time too, I just ordered my 2nd bottle.  I do think that it is helping smooth my wrinkles, and I like that it has such a high spf!&lt;br /&gt;This really is the best lotion I have used in a very long time!</li>
    <li> For some reason this feels gritty as I spread it on my face. It is also very greasy. The greasy shiny look on your face does go away eventually like after 20 minutes. It did also sting a little on me. Dont really like the dispenser. I feel like I dont know how much is left inside and it might not dispense all of it. I think I will finish this bottle off and keep looking for a less greasy feeling moisturizer...</li>
    <li> Great product for my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin. High spf, absorbs well, reasonable price. I think it helps on my wrinkles and firming -sold! Skin is not 35 anymore but pretty good for 58. I started using Regenerist a few months ago and will continue.</li>
    <li> Yes, it does sting a little bit but not a deal breaker. Like the 30 spf - and the price.</li>
    <li> As over 50 year old, I tried Olay&#x27;s DNA cream because it was a SPF 30 and I thought I would get more sun protection.  I find it too thick for facial use and prefer the SPF 15.  So I&#x27;m back to the original and just use the thicker DNA cream on my hands until the bottle is used up.</li>
    <li> First I will admit that I&#x27;m a man in my 50&#x27;s and have worked in the sun a lot over the years...which has led to lots of trips to the dermatologist for skin cancer on my face...and was told to use a sun screen every day...my wife suggested that I try this....I have been using this for a couple years now and it has helped a lot on my red and somewhat wrinkled face....people I run into have commented that they see a difference and that I look younger ! lol</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years when I noticed that my neck was getting that red and white mottled appearance-turkey neck.  Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging DNA cream has improved the discolored appearance a lot and it has 30 SPF sunscreen in it to prevent sun damage all day without a layer of sun screen on top of it.  One and done, I am very satisfied with this Olay cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a long time now and it has never lost its touch.  Made my skin much more beautiful.  ;-)</li>
    <li> I have always liked olay products and found this one to be as good as others.  I am  pleased with my purchases.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for years and love the weight and the high SPF.  I have lightly oily skin, and this is still not too heavy.  The SPF is high, but doesn&#x27;t smell like suntan lotion.  It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.  I&#x27;ve found it less expensively on other websites, and usually buy 5 or 6 at a time.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I live in the Caribbean and the heat here doubled with my oily skin has always been a problem when using facial sunblocks or creams on a whole.  Within an hour or so I look as though I am ready to be fried!  I&#x27;ve used this product under my makeup and my skin feels light and protected.  I was so impressed I just ordered another 6 to keep in stock always and I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Good spf factor, and anti aging as well !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been told that this item has been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it&#x27;s not true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen and moisturizer in one is perfection!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years on a daily basis.  Now all of a sudden I can&#x27;t find it on the shelf at my drugstore or grocery.  I have always liked Olay for the quality of the products and the reasonable prices.  It is frustrating to be happy with a product and suddenly find that it is apparently being phased out for another one which is not as good and more expensive.  I saw no other Regenerist item that could really replace this one, especially with the amount of SPF that&#x27;s so important here in Florida.</li>
    <li> Nice texture, my face  feels softer after application, does not burn like some moisturizers I would purchase again.  Decent size</li>
    <li> I truly love this product especially with the SPF30. Found that it moisturises my skin well. I do mix it with my foundation sometimes depending if I wanted a better coverage or not. Totally amazed with the prompt and friendly communication from &amp;#34;ShopCrazy&amp;#34;. Will definitely recommend this product. In Australia, it&#x27;s extremely pricey, about AU$50 and about $30 when it&#x27;s on special so this price from ShopCrazy is extremely cheap. Too bad, I have to redirect it to another postal service and pay a high price for delivery to Oz. Still it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer for the summer but I &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; it has been discontinued because I can&#x27;t find it in stores. I just hope this place keeps carrying it for awhile anyway. It does the job.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I have been an Olay user for nearly 30 years. I wanted a daily moisturizer with 30 spf for the mean TX sun. Lotion is a bit heavy but that is to be expected due to the higher spf.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product has added a better looking face. I had been using the other products but this made my skin feel younger. I would recommend to 50yr olds that are starting to loose the bounce in your face.</li>
    <li> I love the entire regenerist line!  For the price you are getting great quality.  I like it more than Neutrogena</li>
    <li> I have used Oil of Olay products for years. I started out using more expensive department store brands which worked great but were difficult to afford.I tried the Oil of Olay per the advice of my beautiful mother &amp; was very happily surprised to see the same results for a much more affordable price. I recently switched to the Regenerist line and I really love the fact that it moisturizes without being heavy and definitely minimizes those nasty little lines</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thicker than I expected</li>
    <li> I have always liked Olay products and especially the regenerist line of products. This cream is quickly absorbed into your face. I would think it would work for anyone.</li>
    <li> I wanted something to bring on vacation with sunscreen and this wasn&#x27;t only a good protectant but I found that daily my skin felt softer and softer when I used it.  Something in it feels slightly grainy but this didn&#x27;t bother me at all... maybe it&#x27;s what made the skin so soft!</li>
    <li> The sunscreen part does not work that well.  The lotion is good, but over priced for the quantity.  I would rec if cheaper or more lotion for price.</li>
    <li> I love the product and it works well for me, it keeps my face soft and young and it came in time and I would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the service is amazing, will use it again</li>
    <li> Wife loves her OLAY!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product faithfully for over 2 years. I&#x27;m told my complexion looks so &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; after I&#x27;ve worked a 14 hour day!</li>
    <li> My friend uses this and I relied it for the sunscreen,  However, I am happy with the appearance of my skin. It seems to tighten and the moisturizing affects is very good.  DON&#x27;T however, get it in your eyes, which is typical of any sunscreen</li>
    <li> This product goes on smoothly, does not have any unpleasant odor, and makes my skin look very good. I like the high spf and the fact that you can apply your makeup within a few minutes of putting on this cream and it will not flake off. I have had the \\&quot;flake off\\&quot; problem with many other products.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with the 1st order and the Seller was ever so kind as to reorder and send me another of the same product which worked very well for me. I love Olay products and since I have sensitive skin then I must be very careful with some brands of facial and body cream. This is smooth and I love the fact that it has SPF30, which is recommended amount of SPF.</li>
    <li> Price was awesome! And great product. I have very sensitive skin and this worked wonders for me. I spent 9 days in the sun on vacation and this protected my face great. No complaints. I&#x27;ll definitely order again before my next trip.</li>
    <li> so far so good , i just used it 2 times, my skin feels hydrated and not to greasy , does the job , i will add more if i see positive changes&lt;br /&gt;the problem is when is hot outside and the cream starts melting into the eyes , very irritating , blinding , u cant use a lot around the eyes or none at all&lt;br /&gt;i used other creams w/ SPF and the good ones ( shesheido SPF18 ) have this problem figuered out</li>
    <li> Good value.  You use less of the better creams so i thik they actually are not more expensive than Olay regular daily cream.  I bought my first one in March and am still using it.</li>
    <li> Quite light. Loving the niacinamide and the SPF. They both help to prevent and fight melasma/ skin discoloration. I love the price as well. I don&#x27;t want to pay full price for it because P&amp;G makes them in Asia. I am mad at them because we need those jobs here!!! There are great scientists, chemists biologists here in North America!!!</li>
    <li> This product can really help repair damage in regards to any sort of scars you may have. It lessens their appearance and helps to heal them.</li>
    <li> Love this day cream. Protects my skin from the sun for many hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time now.  It works great and is comparable to the more expensive department store brands. I have tried many, many, many more expensive brands.  I&#x27;m a sucker for skin products and while some of the more expensive brands are &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;, this product provides fantastic value for your money, without having to spend $160 on moisturizer.  One of the many reasons I continue to use this product is  because it absorbs really well into my skin and is one of the few products available with SPF 30.</li>
    <li> Great all purpose cream with the added bonus of 30SPF sunblock. It&#x27;s getting hard to find. Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I received a product dated 6/2014 -- almost a year too old.  All the other labelling had been removed but they had not cut it out of box.  Sunscreens are dated so they are not used past the due date.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> I have never bought drugstore moisturizers in the past.  This is an exception because &amp;#34;The Cosmetic Cop&amp;#34; rates this product high and I was tired of paying over $50 for a good moisturizer with sunscreen.  I love the texture.  Only wish it was not a red container.</li>
    <li> I got this in a pinch because I didn&#x27;t want to blow the bank for a basic daily SPF. But, once Im done, Ill move on. It stings the skin around my eyes. Also, It feels like little itty bitty micro beads are in it and its scratchy when I rub it into my face. If I am super gentle when applying I can minimize the irritation. But, overall Im only barely satisfied because it works in that my face does burn in the sun. I do have sensitive skin so it may just be that my skin disagrees with it. Not a huge fan, Ill be going back to Thomas Roths Daily SPF.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an olay girl so this is part of my daily regime. Like that it&#x27;s got SPF 30.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it leaves your face soft but also has SPF in it for sun protection</li>
    <li> Used this product for years. Great product</li>
