      <li>I was introduced to Dr. Tinsley&#x27;s cleansing souflee years ago when I went to him for treatment, I love it .  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>My skin feels clean and looks amazing.</li>

      <li>My face feels fresh and clean after using.  </li>
      <li>this made my face feel clean and fresh  </li>
      <li>I tend to have oily skin especially in this warm weather</li>
      <li>My skin no longer feels rough, but nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>It did clean my face very well but the breakouts continued.  </li>
      <li>Also if you did the detox cleanse which is supposed to clear up your face along with this product, you wouldn&#x27;t need this product anyway, your face would clear up on its own.</li>
      <li>I was wondering does the skin goes through this process first before you see the results you supposed to get with this product.</li>
      <li>For the first couple of weeks, I just used the cleansing souffle&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>and I have noticed (after the first use) that my skin in longer oily.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this because it has only made my face look better.  </li>
      <li>I am totally pleased with the overall results.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Dr Tinsley !</li>
      <li>yes, it doesn&#x27;t take much at all to cleanse your face, I use the product twice a day.</li>
      <li>I really wanted this product to work because I heard Dr. Tinsley&#x27;s talk about his products on the radio in Atl.</li>
      <li>Thanks Dr. T</li>
      <li>So Much, Dr. Tinsley</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>which may very well be true, however, if you bought all of the recommended products the maker of this product wants you to buy just to get the facial result</li>
      <li>My dark marks are cleared up and my skin is very smooth.</li>
      <li>and I normally don&#x27;t pay this much for products.  </li>
      <li>and I have noticed that my skin looks a little different (in a good way.)</li>
      <li>I believe that used in conjunction with the Hydrating Souffl&amp;eacute; Creamed Facial Moisturizer, my facial skin tone has become more even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the product.  </li>
      <li>My skin is so soft and my complexion is clear.  </li>
      <li>I think my skin is way too sensitive for his product.</li>
      <li>I used Dr Tinsley&#x27;s cleansing souffle for 2-3 weeks and my face and neck are full of dark blotches and spots.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going back to my old cleanser, Burts Bee.</li>
      <li>A couple of times, while using the product I went back to my old habit of not drinking enough water and had breakouts again.  </li>
      <li>Not only has my skin tone improved and the bags decreased, but the texture is better too.    </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and the other items that are offered by this vendor.</li>
      <li>I want so much for this product to work because it&#x27;s black owned</li>

<li> I got breakouts and my skin became very dry.  </li>
<li> I usually get a pimple or two (nothing major) and I havent had any pimple problems.  </li>
<li> Only a little does it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a souffle type consistency, however, it&#x27;s difficult to determine how much you actually need to use.</li>

<li> &amp; of course the maker of the product would probably say well that&#x27;s because of your diet and other factors involved</li>
<li> Bought\\&quot; statement, I do not like any of the suggestions and, frankly, I am not interested in what someone else bought.  </li>
<li> It did not help with my dark circles at all.  </li>
<li> Within a week some dark spots had faded.  </li>
<li> It only takes a very small amount per  use so</li>
<li> I heard about this Product on the Warren Ballentine Radio show, and have been using it for over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;I am a black man with the typical in-grown hair bumps on my face in the beard area.</li>
<li> I have been using it for a little over a week</li>

<li> I was a little thrown off by the packaging.  </li>
<li> I purchased the product a few months ago but have had to discontinue using it.  </li>

<li> What a waste of money!</li>
<li> But now it seems as if my skin is breaking out with all these small pimples.  </li>

<li> I was very disappointed in this product especially for the money that I paid for it.</li>
<li> but, I was unable to get through to call in to ask him questions about his product hopefully</li>
<li> I still have \\&quot;freckles\\&quot; but they don&#x27;t look as bad.  </li>

    <li> I was skeptical about this product at first. I have ordered this product and noticed results immediately! My dark marks are cleared up and my skin is very smooth. Blemishes have stopped also. I know have my teenage son using it for his breakouts and the product has done a wonderful job!</li>
    <li> I used Dr Tinsley&#x27;s cleansing souffle for 2-3 weeks and my face and neck are full of dark blotches and spots. I am going to discontinue using this product. I drink 64oz plus in water daily and have regular bowel movements. I think my skin is way too sensitive for his product.</li>
    <li> yes, it doesn&#x27;t take much at all to cleanse your face, I use the product twice a day. I tend to have oily skin especially in this warm weather and I have noticed (after the first use) that my skin in longer oily. That&#x27;s a blessing I can probably start wearing makeup now w/o having to blot or reapply  powder all day. I have only been using for about a week and a half now, the verdict is still out on clearing up the skin. Will write another review later. So far I am happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I purchased Dr. Tinsley&#x27;s cleansing souffle&#x27; facial cleanser months ago. I used the product for a week and I noticed breakouts and very dry skin. I was wondering does the skin goes through this process first before you see the results you supposed to get with this product. I have not used it anymore  because I don&#x27;t want my skin to breakout. I really wanted this product to work because I heard Dr. Tinsley&#x27;s talk about his products on the radio in Atl. but, I was unable to get through to call in to ask him questions about his product hopefully, he read the reviews and gives feed back about the product.</li>
    <li> I started ordering it after I heard about it on the Warren Ballentine show.   It has been four months and I dont see the amazing results as I thought.  I    will continue to use it because it does take time.  I started using another product with   it and that seems to work better than using the this alone.</li>
    <li> If you want the clearest smoothest skin possible then this is the product to use.  It&#x27;s great for shaving too!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for a little over a week and I can see the dark spots in my face vanishing and my skin is soft and supple. My skin no longer feels rough, but nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I just turned 50 and have had a problem with breakouts since puberty.  Folks could comment about my \\&quot;freckles\\&quot; which were actually years of scarring.  I have been using Flawless for just 2 months.  The results are remarkable.  I actually saw same day results.  Within a week some dark spots had faded.  My cheeks looked leathery and I had bags under my eyes. Not only has my skin tone improved and the bags decreased, but the texture is better too.    Now my cheeks look supple and have a healthy glow.  A couple of times, while using the product I went back to my old habit of not drinking enough water and had breakouts again.  I continued using the product and this eliminated the scarring that use to occur.  For the first couple of weeks, I just used the cleansing souffle&#x27;.  When I started using the moisturizing cream, I had an initial adverse reaction but this subsided after a week or so.  Also it seemed to be drying my skin out, but this was actually the old dead skin falling off.      I am totally pleased with the overall results.  I use the product daily.  Recently I began to use it twice a day.  I just get twice the results.  I still have \\&quot;freckles\\&quot; but they don&#x27;t look as bad.  I am looking forward to having flawless skin again.</li>
    <li> I like it.  My face feels fresh and clean after using.  I usually get a pimple or two (nothing major) and I havent had any pimple problems.  These results are only after a month.  I will continue to use this because it has only made my face look better.  I have sensative skin and it works fine.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product especially for the money that I paid for it. This product did not do what it is advertised to do &amp; of course the maker of the product would probably say well that&#x27;s because of your diet and other factors involved which may very well be true, however, if you bought all of the recommended products the maker of this product wants you to buy just to get the facial result you would end up spending way more money.  Also if you did the detox cleanse which is supposed to clear up your face along with this product, you wouldn&#x27;t need this product anyway, your face would clear up on its own. Also the product does not have a pleasant smell either.</li>
    <li> I purchase two.  One for my brother and one for me.  I shave with it under my arms and legs and panties line so far so good.  It&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
    <li> For me, the product works well.  I have eczema and my patches are not scaly or crusty.  I use it as an all over body wash.  I believe that used in conjunction with the Hydrating Souffl&amp;eacute; Creamed Facial Moisturizer, my facial skin tone has become more even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the \\&quot;Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought\\&quot; statement, I do not like any of the suggestions and, frankly, I am not interested in what someone else bought.  I will do my own research and make my decisions based on my findings.</li>
    <li> I purchased the product a few months ago but have had to discontinue using it.  I got breakouts and my skin became very dry.  It did clean my face very well but the breakouts continued.  It did not help with my dark circles at all.  I&#x27;m going back to my old cleanser, Burts Bee.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I was a little thrown off by the packaging.  But I can&#x27;t complain about a thing.  This product is better than the claims in the advertising.  My skin is so soft and my complexion is clear.  Thanks So Much, Dr. Tinsley</li>
    <li> I want so much for this product to work because it&#x27;s black owned and I normally don&#x27;t pay this much for products.  I have been on the product for about a month.  When I first started using it, it seemed to be a difference in my skin that no one else noticed, but it was looking better to me.  But now it seems as if my skin is breaking out with all these small pimples.  I hope they go away soon as well as my blemishes.  I just don&#x27;t know how I feel about the product yet.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product just as a cleaning agent only; I don&#x27;t have problematic skin. I have been using the product for about a month and I have noticed that my skin looks a little different (in a good way.) I did have an unnoticeable dark blemish on one side of my face close to my ear, and it has began to clear up. I would recommend this product. I wouldn&#x27;t expect any miracles, but I have noticed a difference in my face.</li>
    <li> I started this product at the end of the month of December. I&#x27;m still waiting for results. But I have cystic acne and I have tried everything and I have drained my pockets with results in bottled products. I don&#x27;t know if this will work or not. Just like my skin doctor said, \\&quot;acne is all about trial and error.\\&quot; So I am just patiently waiting to see if it works. I have noticed drying in my skin. Because it does have alcohol in this product but I will update my review after a month from now.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Dr. Tinsley&#x27;s cleansing souflee years ago when I went to him for treatment, I love it .  It&#x27;s the best cleanser I have ever had, will buy it forever.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr. Tinsely&#x27;s Cleansing Souffle for years. It cleans the skin without drying and leaves it radiant. The jar lasts for months so it actually turns out to be cheaper than department store and drug store brands. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it and tell your friends!</li>
    <li> I never saw any results that I can say I was satisfied with,  Maybe I needed to use for over a yr, but if I don&#x27;t see results in 6 mos, I feel it is a waste of time and money</li>
    <li> I have been using the cleanser for over a year and will reorder when it&#x27;s available. I use this product in conjunction with a Clarsonic brush...great combination. My skin feels clean and looks amazing.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the product.  It cleans my face without the harshness  of some other products I have used in the past. It only takes a very small amount per  use so the jar will last for a long time,and I use it twice a day. I have noticed that my skin is not as oily as it used to be in the morning since I have been using the cleansing souffle and it actually appears to be clearer than before.  I would buy this again and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> It broke my face out more. I used it for 2 days. What a waste of money! I would NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Its absolutely wonderful and its making my skin look and feel so healthy. Bye bye makeup!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a little over a month ago when I wanted to get rid of the blemishes and blackheads that were appearing on my face.  The smell was so strong it made my eyes water.  It&#x27;s a souffle type consistency, however, it&#x27;s difficult to determine how much you actually need to use. Also, after I used this product I had some negative reactions to chap stick, so everything is put on the shelf until I can figure out who&#x27;s the culprit.</li>
    <li> this made my face feel clean and fresh  I love this product and will continue to order.  Thanks Dr. T</li>
    <li> This item was truely great I highly recommend this product and the other items that are offered by this vendor. I received the product quickly and the packaging was great :-)</li>
    <li> I love this product and so does my husband! Only a little does it. I noticed a change in my skin and complexion immediately, dead cells began to loosen without applying pressure.  Dee</li>
    <li> I heard about this Product on the Warren Ballentine Radio show, and have been using it for over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;I am a black man with the typical in-grown hair bumps on my face in the beard area. Since I started using this product, my in-grown hair have been severely reduced&lt;br /&gt;and the darker beard shadow is almost gone. Thanks Dr Tinsley !</li>
