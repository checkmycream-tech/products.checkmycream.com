      <li>(I got this item free in exchange for a review)</li>
      <li>So far so good</li>
      <li>It was not outrageously expensive and worked like a dream!!</li>
      <li>xo to New Radiance Naturals for making such incredible products!</li>
      <li>So, I was quite surprised and very pleased</li>
      <li>OK I guess can&#x27;t really tell a difference!</li>
      <li>It goes on super smooth and it makes my skin feel refreshed.</li>
      <li>I applied this to clean skin, before my make up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>It soaks right in and dries very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I never had used a special product for myi eyes</li>
      <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
      <li>I was amazed at how quickly I saw results.</li>
      <li>It smells like fresh melon and it feels so cool going on the skin.</li>
      <li>When I returned to purchase more of the New Radiance Vitamin Serum, I saw this eye gel.  </li>
      <li>I do not usually write reviews but my eyes look 100% better.</li>
      <li>I also absolutely love that they use vegan, cruelty-free formulas with natural and organic ingredients.</li>
      <li>Maybe...my thoughts are that I earned everyone of those smile lines.</li>
      <li>I love using eye creams and when I was given a chance to try this one out, I was completely hooked.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the price.  </li>
      <li>I have stayed out of the sun most of my adult life, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of issues with wrinkles (knock on wood)</li>
      <li>The findings above are my own.</li>
      <li>I got to try this product free for review, it is so thick and really really moisturizing, I LOVED it the minute I put it on!</li>
      <li>I have also been using it on my fine lines and on areas where fine lines will most likely develop and so far, I like how my skin is looking</li>
      <li>it worked right away.</li>
      <li>I have tried many, many eye creams looking for one that will take away my dark circles.</li>
      <li>It goes on so smoothly and has a nice, slightly cooling sensation.</li>
      <li>Since I started using New Radiance Naturals products, the fine lines around my eyes have faded significantly and my skin overall is noticeably more youthful and vibrant.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only 21 years-old, and don&#x27;t have to worry much about eye wrinkles, but it has helped with my dark circles, which is great!</li>
      <li>I have bought numerous other products that claimed great results over the years and they have not worked in any significant way.  </li>
      <li>and a little help .......also makes us feel good.....</li>
      <li>Using these two products together has brought even better results  --  reduced dark circles, fine lines and firmer skin texture.  </li>
      <li>love products that can be applied to multiple</li>
      <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
      <li>Have been using this eye gel for about almost 2 weeks and am seeing great improvement in the delicate areas around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I am an essential oil junkie and love seeing on the list of ingredients it contains frankincense.</li>
      <li>No surprise since the first ingredient listed is aloe.</li>
      <li>I have tried many creams similar to</li>
      <li>I love the fact that religiously using this eye gel helped with my dilemma!</li>
      <li>I just love how it is so fast acting right when I put it on it</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in the fine lines around my eyes, but the discoloration and puffiness around them has gone down significantly.</li>
      <li>I have always struggled with eye puffiness regardless of how much sleep I get.</li>
      <li>Between the two products, my face has really improved.</li>
      <li>I really like it when I can see results, after a short&lt;br /&gt;period of usage.</li>

    <li> I do not usually write reviews but my eyes look 100% better. I have had crows feet forever and this is helping a lot. I LOVED IT. I need another bottle my wife are very happy with the product. I recomend for mens to. JOSE TANGARIFE</li>
    <li> it worked right away. it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I love using eye creams and when I was given a chance to try this one out, I was completely hooked. I have always struggled with eye puffiness regardless of how much sleep I get. I just wake up with puffy eyes by default and the puffiness never goes away &#x27;til noon or mid afternoon (hate it). I love the fact that religiously using this eye gel helped with my dilemma! I have also been using it on my fine lines and on areas where fine lines will most likely develop and so far, I like how my skin is looking like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I got this product free in exchange for my honest review.This product is NOT to be underestimate I was pretty skeptical but I have been using for a well now and am really impressed. It has made he areas around my eyes more smooth more color and the skin is so much more healthier and full of moisture I just love how it is so fast acting right when I put it on it seems to start filling the skin with moisture and tightening the skin around my eyes. I think that this is a product someone could use for any eye issues and not worry if it will work or not bexuasw they will see the results them selves in days starting to workit has helped with mydark circles, bags, lines, crows feet, wrinkles, sagging</li>
    <li> This product is great! It smells like cucumber mellon, and you can feel the change in your skin a few minutes after you put it on! Your skin feels hydrated and firm after a few minutes! I put this one at night after I wash my face, but you can also put this on before you do your typical makeup routine! It&#x27;s diffiuclt to find products like this that smell great, and I&#x27;m very satisfied! I&#x27;m only 21 years-old, and don&#x27;t have to worry much about eye wrinkles, but it has helped with my dark circles, which is great! Even though I did receive this product for free to review, I would recommend it and buy it again! Great product!</li>
    <li> This product achieved no results for my puffy dark under eye area.</li>
    <li> I really like New Radiance Naturals&#x27; Anti-Aging Eye Gel! It goes on so smoothly and has a nice, slightly cooling sensation. It also has a faint, pleasant, fresh scent. I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in the fine lines around my eyes, but the discoloration and puffiness around them has gone down significantly. I&#x27;m excited to keep using it, and to see more improvements. I also absolutely love that they use vegan, cruelty-free formulas with natural and organic ingredients. (I got this item free in exchange for a review)</li>
    <li> I wanted to give this a really good test before I made a decision on whether or not this works for me. I have been using it for about a month so far, and I have to say, I do see some results. I have tried many, many eye creams looking for one that will take away my dark circles. The bags I can live with, but the circles age me like nothing else on my face. I have stayed out of the sun most of my adult life, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of issues with wrinkles (knock on wood) but my eyes look like a football player before a game sometimes. This cream has really reduced them, they are not gone, but I can really see a difference in them. I apply it twice daily, morning and night. It goes on smooth, and absorbs quickly. I can put on my make up fairly soon after I use it. So fingers crossed that this will continue to reduce the circles and I can feel comfortable with the appearance of my eyes again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; * I received this product free to evaluate and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I really like it when I can see results, after a short&lt;br /&gt;period of usage. This is one of those products.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a small bottle, with a pump to squirt.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a medium consistency, not thick&lt;br /&gt;but not runny. It does not have a scent...&lt;br /&gt;I am a night owl, so I constantly have tired&lt;br /&gt;eyes... I have tried many creams similar to&lt;br /&gt;this one. I applied this to clean skin, before my make up.&lt;br /&gt;I could really see a difference the next day!!!&lt;br /&gt;There is really a small amount in the package,&lt;br /&gt;but it just takes like one pump, to cover your face.&lt;br /&gt;I did apply this to my lip and cheek area also.&lt;br /&gt;I love products that can be applied to multiple&lt;br /&gt;areas. I did not experience any redness, itching or&lt;br /&gt;peeling from this gel. I was sent this product, discounted,&lt;br /&gt;for testing purposes. The findings above are my own.</li>
    <li> This product is made in the USA which means a great deal to me if I am going to put it on my face! New Radiance Naturals Ani-Aging Eye Gel contains plant stem cells. The directions are simple after cleansing your face gently dab around eyes and forehead and cheek areas. Avoid getting into your eyes! It is safe to use morning and night as an all over face treatment and can be used under makeup. The product is used to help with dark circles, lines, wrinkles, sagging, puffiness, loss of tone, resililence and youthful suppleness. I like that it states it is purity tested quality assured on it. The product takes 2 years to expire. This is a 1 oz sizes bottle. It has a gel like look and feel to it. Think of it as an aloe vera substance and that is it and it also feels like aloe vera when you put it on. No surprise since the first ingredient listed is aloe. I am an essential oil junkie and love seeing on the list of ingredients it contains frankincense.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. The company sent me the product to try. I was not compensated to review the product.  I love the smell of it. It smells like fresh melon and it feels so cool going on the skin. The product only takes a small amount. It goes on your skin like silk. I would purchase this product for sure.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product free for review, it is so thick and really really moisturizing, I LOVED it the minute I put it on!</li>
    <li> My sister bought two and gave me one as a gift and I love it. I can see a big difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product since it has reduced the fullness around my eyes &amp; lines under my eyes, it really works.  The prices is affordable if compare with same products in the market. Donna A. Egan.</li>
    <li> I used the New Radiance Naturals serum for quite some time and am extremely happy with the effects it has had on my prematurely-aging skin. As such, I decided to go ahead and buy the eye gel also to determine whether I prefer one over the other. I have been using the gel for about a month now and I have to say, it works just as well as the serum! It goes on smoothly and blends in immediately, leaving no shine or residue. Since I started using New Radiance Naturals products, the fine lines around my eyes have faded significantly and my skin overall is noticeably more youthful and vibrant. Will definitely continue buying this brand. It is affordable and actually produces the results promised.</li>
    <li> OK I guess can&#x27;t really tell a difference!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received this product very early and was so happy and thought I cannot wait to try this product. To my amazement it has been working!! I notice a younger appearance right away on the second use.  I also notice that all the lines and dark circles, GONE!! I look about 5 years has been taken off in just one week.  I cannot wait to see what this week will bring. Very satisfied, though I was a bit skeptical with other reviews, but my experience is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I really have a hard time finding something I honestly like.. Well... I honestly like this product I seen a slight difference the first few days of using it... Cool!</li>
    <li> I bought this just to see if it might work.  I have bought numerous other products that claimed great results over the years and they have not worked in any significant way.  So, I was quite surprised and very pleased when within a week I saw both the dark circles and the puffiness underneath my eyes begin to diminish in a major way.  Great product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> When I returned to purchase more of the New Radiance Vitamin Serum, I saw this eye gel.  I never had used a special product for myi eyes but I was getting puffy areas on both sides.  Well, I am as happy with the eye gel as I am with the serum.  I have used it for 2 weeks and the puffiness has diminished greatly.  You only have to use a tiny bit for each eye.  It soaks right in and dries very quickly.  Then I pit the serum on.  I had decided I would only write a review if I got compliments and I got three at the end of last week.  Between the two products, my face has really improved.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not seeing any results as of yet</li>
    <li> I see no change under my eyes</li>
    <li> This eye gel is amazing!!! I&#x27;ve been looking for something to get rid of the puffiness under my eyes and I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and it&#x27;s been working! It goes on super smooth and it makes my skin feel refreshed. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase :)</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel smooth and I can see improvement in my face.  I use it all over my face.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Not as best as other reviews said.</li>
    <li> natural radiance  naturals anti aging  eye gel is really a great product.  I have been using this product for 10 day and can really see a difference in the eye area  I had a lot of wrinkles around my eye area  this product has made them vanish.  I highly recommend this  product .I am updating my review, since starting  using this product in October  I am really seeing a difference in the eye are . this is really one of the best products I have ever tried. I would highly recommend this product to any one who has wrinkles  around the eye are . a must try product you will be amazed at the results you will get.</li>
    <li> Nothing to write home about. Just mske my skin sticky. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love the product. it feels refreshing when you put it on. The skin around my eyes look smoother. This product will be part of my regular routine. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now with unbelievable results. My skin feels softer and the significant reduction of wrinkles around my eyes have left me speechless. Definitely recommend this product for everyone out there seeking for a soft radiant skin and to reduce those annoying age lines we develop over time.</li>
    <li> Recently got my order and I have seen a great improvement with my puffiness. It is easily absorbed and you don&#x27;t feel any weight or greasiness like with other products. So far so good and I&#x27;m hoping to get better results as time passes. I also ordered the vitamin C serum and I am very happy with it as well.</li>
    <li> Still using.......you know at 72 ..... we can&#x27;t expect miracles......but just try to look the best we can......it takes more than products.....eat healthy....get some exercise.....lotz sleep......don&#x27;t be overweight or you&#x27;ll never look or feel good.....and a little help .......also makes us feel good.....try it....I think it does help!!!!</li>
    <li> My face lift a lot!!! amazing product this gel is favoulos</li>
    <li> Great product and very affordable!!</li>
    <li> Have been using this eye gel for about almost 2 weeks and am seeing great improvement in the delicate areas around my eyes.  Being over a certain age ( 60 )  I decided to use this gel both morning and night in addition to New Radiance Natural&#x27;s Anti-Aging Vitamin C Serum.  Using these two products together has brought even better results  --  reduced dark circles, fine lines and firmer skin texture.  I&#x27;m hoping the results get better and better over time.  Very satisfied -- Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Reallyyyyyy love this product!  &amp;#34;Crows feet&amp;#34; were noticeably diminished within a couple of weeks! I waited a few weeks to write review to make sure it was as good as it seemed to be ... and, it was even BETTER!  Totally worth the price.  Wish I had found this years ago ... but, the way it&#x27;s been working, I&#x27;m just so happy to have found it.  Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> It is a little too soon to tell if it is going to work on my wrinkles, but I do love the way it glides on my face.  And it makes my face feel smooth.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how quickly I saw results. After only a few days, fine lines were much less visible and puffiness was reduced. I have used very expensive eye cream in the past - nothing compares to the results I see with this eye gel. Great customer service too! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Not really excited with product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and do not see a difference</li>
    <li> It does not do anything for wrinkles. I wish I could find the product I was using for years. It is called Isabelle Pelle! It seems they went out of business! It was not outrageously expensive and worked like a dream!!</li>
