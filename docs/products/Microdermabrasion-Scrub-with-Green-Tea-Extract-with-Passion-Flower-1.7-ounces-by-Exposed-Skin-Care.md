      <li>and I feel my skin look smoother and more refreshed.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the Exposed system for about 2 years now, and the microderm scrub is one of my favorite parts.</li>
      <li>I have used many different kinds of face wash, this is the best one.</li>
      <li>I was going to breakout, it would almost put a barrier on my face and make sure that everything went away over night.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite item from the Exposed skin care products.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite product of theirs.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Almost all natural ingredients and organic extracts are used for every step of the system and is perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great addition to the Facial Cleanser.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like cleaning out deep into your pores over night and it is just amazing!</li>
      <li>You need to put a lot more on your hand to get more scrub action going all over the face.  </li>
      <li>It took me awhile to understand I was a good candidate for regularly scheduled exfoliation.</li>
      <li>It is seriously one of the best products and i recommend this to anyone!</li>
      <li>I use this product about once per week and have found it to be really good at exfoliating and removing dry skin cells.  </li>
      <li>Your skin really feels refreshed and helps it be incredibly smooth.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that using it once a week and at night works best for me because it does leave my skin a little red afterward.  </li>
      <li>It gently exfoliates my skin and leaves it feeling soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>Hopefully different brands of Microderm scrub tubes will be more available in the future.</li>
      <li>It really clears up my skin FAST!</li>
      <li>My Biore was $22 and had 3.0 oz and lasted longer because you didn&#x27;t need to put on as much.  </li>
      <li>This really helps you face feel smoother.</li>
      <li>It really does what it says it will do.  </li>
      <li>I use every Friday night for the weekend when I am ready to go out</li>
      <li>Not only does this scrub reduce redness and smooth skin, it just plain makes your skin feel better after use.</li>
      <li>The Microderm scrub is one of my favorite products by far because it does exactly what its supposed to, gives you a mini microdermabrasion treatment removing dead skin cells and providing antioxidants to relieve inflammation.</li>
      <li>This scrub made my skin clear up in a snap over night!</li>
      <li>Although I could see women liking Expose&#x27;s milder scrub, the results for me on the first go was only so-so.  </li>
      <li>It even helps to clear up any blemishes that may be there.</li>
      <li>Definitely recommend using a moisturizer afterward because it dries my skin slightly, but overall love the way it works.</li>
      <li>But I would Highly recommend their facial cleanser, toner and acne treatment serum.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Exposed Microderm Scrub several times now and love how it removes dead skin cells and instantly smooths my skin.  </li>
      <li>I found the Expose Scrub a little on the mild side.</li>
      <li>I actually feel like it goes down into my pores to clean out any dirt and oil.</li>
      <li>They have worked so well and instantly for me and regular use very efficiently clears skin and controls breakout.</li>
      <li>With my Biore, you only needed a small amount and the scrub feel was much stronger which I prefer, being a man, and I could see the results right away-my face looked clearer and whiter and glowing.  </li>
      <li>It works extremely well leaving the skin ridiculously soft and clear for the next day, I use at night maybe only once or twice a week.</li>

<li> So it feels a little like robbery on the Expose side.</li>
<li> It leaves my face feeling refreshed and looking brighter with the removal of the dead skin.  </li>
<li> Also, the Expose Microderm Tube is only 1.7 oz and at $30 dollars seems quite expensive.  </li>
<li> and my acne decreased (in conjunction with the rest of my Expose product use).  </li>
<li> I have moderate chronic acne, and when I break out bad, its bad.</li>
<li> But the product I received smelled like it had gone rancid, and made it hard for me to use because the smell was so bad.  </li>
<li> For the last 30 years, I have suffered with terrible skin (acne).</li>

    <li> not too impressed by the scrub, had some breakouts after using the product. But I would Highly recommend their facial cleanser, toner and acne treatment serum. They have worked so well and instantly for me and regular use very efficiently clears skin and controls breakout. Love EXPOSED!!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product and had to buy a full size because I thought it was so great!  But the product I received smelled like it had gone rancid, and made it hard for me to use because the smell was so bad.  If it weren&#x27;t for the smell, I would be reordering it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I use every Friday night for the weekend when I am ready to go out and I feel my skin look smoother and more refreshed.  Seriously good product.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. For the last 30 years, I have suffered with terrible skin (acne). It took me awhile to understand I was a good candidate for regularly scheduled exfoliation. Once I started using Exposed Microderm Scrub, I saw the clarity of my skin improve immediately and my acne decreased (in conjunction with the rest of my Expose product use).  Sometimes at night, I use the Microderm before my Expose cleanser, in order to help the Expose Pore Serum penetrate my pores deeper. For me, it works. You have to try this!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this product with another purchase, and I got hooked. This really helps you face feel smoother.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Exposed Microderm Scrub several times now and love how it removes dead skin cells and instantly smooths my skin.

    <li> Not only does this scrub reduce redness and smooth skin, it just plain makes your skin feel better after use. I use it a couple of times a week.</li>
    <li> It really does what it says it will do.  If you need to just buff away all the extra stuff, this is the product for you.  Your skin really feels refreshed and helps it be incredibly smooth.  I only use it about once a week, otherwise I&#x27;ve noticed my skin gets a little too dry.  But in moderation, it really is a great product to have on hand!</li>

    <li> I tried this product because my regular scrub was discontinued: Biore &#x27;Microderm Exfoliator&#x27;.  I found the Expose Scrub a little on the mild side. You need to put a lot more on your hand to get more scrub action going all over the face.  With my Biore, you only needed a small amount and the scrub feel was much stronger which I prefer, being a man, and I could see the results right away-my face looked clearer and whiter and glowing.  Although I could see women liking Expose&#x27;s milder scrub, the results for me on the first go was only so-so.

So it feels a little like robbery on the Expose side. Ohhhh why did Biore discontinue their wonderful product.  urrrgghhh.  Hopefully different brands of Microderm scrub tubes will be more available in the future.</li>
    <li> I use this product about once per week and have found it to be really good at exfoliating and removing dry skin cells.  It isn&#x27;t too harsh, but you still need to apply it gently or it can cause irritation.  It leaves my face feeling refreshed and looking brighter with the removal of the dead skin.  It is a little expensive, but you don&#x27;t have to use very much so the tube lasts a long time.  I would recommend this product as a finishing touch to skin care.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I have been using the Exposed system for about 2 years now, and the microderm scrub is one of my favorite parts. It gently exfoliates my skin and leaves it feeling soft and healthy. It even helps to clear up any blemishes that may be there. I actually feel like it goes down into my pores to clean out any dirt and oil. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This scrub is great for a once a week use! It leaves my skin feeling extra soft after getting rid of all the dirt and dead skin cells that are stuck in my pores. My acne, which I have struggled with, has dramatically improved using this scrub along other Exposed Skincare products, like the Basic Kit. I definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. Can&#x27;t be without!</li>
    <li> Microderm scrub efficiently removes blackheads from my son&#x27;s nose.  It&#x27;s a great addition to the Facial Cleanser.</li>
    <li> This scrub made my skin clear up in a snap over night! it&#x27;s so awesome. It&#x27;s like cleaning out deep into your pores over night and it is just amazing! Everytime I was going to breakout, it would almost put a barrier on my face and make sure that everything went away over night. It is seriously one of the best products and i recommend this to anyone! It&#x27;s so good!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite item from the Exposed skin care products. I use it about 2-3 times a week. It&#x27;s like giving yourself a facial. It works great with the microfiber cloth. It really clears up my skin FAST! love it.</li>
