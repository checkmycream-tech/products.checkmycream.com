      <li>Great Product as well as the conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Great product when combined with the shampoo</li>
      <li>Loving the Age Premium line!</li>
      <li>but it does a good job conditioning my hair.</li>
      <li>Seller was good.</li>
      <li>Very effective product with a nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>and I love it!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t honestly remember why I got hooked.</li>
      <li>Smells nice.</li>
      <li>Wonderful for older women&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>I would honestly say my hair looks and acts better than it has in years.</li>
      <li>Although it is a good conditioner with a pleasant smell, I can&#x27;t justify its high price.</li>
      <li>, I noticed a huge improvement in my hair!</li>
      <li>When you age your hair tends to be more course</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>and I love this line.</li>
      <li>This, paired with the Age Premium shampoo, leaves my hair soft and shiny without making it fly away.</li>
      <li>Have been using this lightweight conditioner for several years it is a great every time  </li>
      <li>and this tends to smooth it out softening it.  </li>
      <li>This item did absolutely nothing for my hair, not even worth $3 if it was a product available in drugstores.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s advertized as being good for &#x27;Aged&#x27; hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is good for the hair or not, but it is very lightweight, and leaves my hair (fine, slightly wavy) in tangles that hurt to comb out.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is light, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and provides a nice texture.  </li>
      <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, unless after using it more, I find a much bigger difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>This is a great conditioner, and a little goes a long way for fine hair.</li>
      <li>Did not really make my hair look any better.</li>
      <li>i have been using for over a year and it really makes a difference in your hair.</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t need much to do the job</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t overwhelm my hair with either too much conditioning or too much fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It is lite weight, and makes my hair more manageble for styling without weighing down.</li>
      <li>This is one instance where purchasing from a store is better than online as the store will allow the product to be returned if not satisfied.</li>
      <li>The extra time and probably steam/heat really helps too.</li>
      <li>I have only had a chance to use it a few times and, while it smells really nice, makes my grey hair sparkle in the sun</li>
      <li>I live in a very dry mountain climate and this protects my hair from the dryness and the intense UV rays.</li>
      <li>It seems to be a gentle, light product that doesn&#x27;t make my hair worse.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for everyday as it does not weigh my thin hair down!</li>
      <li>Other, much cheaper, products will do the same thing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Never have I used a shampoo system that made my hair so shiny. This, paired with the Age Premium shampoo, leaves my hair soft and shiny without making it fly away. I have medium thick dark hair and I love this line. I live in a very dry mountain climate and this protects my hair from the dryness and the intense UV rays.</li>
    <li> This item did absolutely nothing for my hair, not even worth $3 if it was a product available in drugstores.</li>
    <li> this is not worth the money. but it does a good job conditioning my hair. i would not buy it again. i do like brand though</li>
    <li> I have only had a chance to use it a few times and, while it smells really nice, makes my grey hair sparkle in the sun and you don&#x27;t need much to do the job, I will say that I&#x27;m not that impressed with the product. Other, much cheaper, products will do the same thing. Now if it was half the price or even a quarter of it I would give it another star or even two. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, unless after using it more, I find a much bigger difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used it for several weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed a change in the amount of hair loss. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel thicker but it doesn&#x27;t make it feel weighted down either. It seems to be a gentle, light product that doesn&#x27;t make my hair worse.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hair salon.  When you age your hair tends to be more course and this tends to smooth it out softening it.  I would recommend it if you are over 50 or so.</li>
    <li> Have been using this lightweight conditioner for several years it is a great every time  you wash conditioner.  Doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.  Wonderful for older women&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE:  This company will never take any product for return,&lt;br /&gt;even unopened. I had a reaction to shampoo and never opened conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;This company will not speak to you or do they have an 800 number.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is good for the hair or not, but it is very lightweight, and leaves my hair (fine, slightly wavy) in tangles that hurt to comb out. Smells nice. It&#x27;s advertized as being good for &#x27;Aged&#x27; hair. I&#x27;m 65, and I don&#x27;t know if my hair is &#x27;aged&#x27; but I cannot imagine using this as I get older for the annoyance of having to be gentle and slow in combing out my wet hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner, and a little goes a long way for fine hair. It is lite weight, and makes my hair more manageble for styling without weighing down.</li>
    <li> Floe the money this is not the best product. Seller was good. Product just average.  Did not really make my hair look any better.</li>
    <li> This works well.  It doesn&#x27;t overwhelm my hair with either too much conditioning or too much fragrance.  I do wish that Kerastase would make the instructions for use in larger print so I would not have to use a magnifying glass to find it.  I like their products, but one would think that especially in a product for &amp;#34;mature hair&amp;#34; they would enlarge the instructions or include a separate statement in larger print.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is light, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and provides a nice texture.  My hair has never been healthier looking.</li>
    <li> Great product when combined with the shampoo</li>
    <li> Since I had the Kerastase Age Recharge shampoo, but needed conditioner, my hairdresser recommended this. While I used up the Age Recharge, I did not particularly care for the conditioner but as soon as it was gone and I bought the Age Premium shampoo, I noticed a huge improvement in my hair! Lots of shine and body but not the wax and grease of other Kerastase shampoo/conditioners I have used for drier hair. Loving the Age Premium line! I would honestly say my hair looks and acts better than it has in years. I alternate between this conditioner and the masque type in the jar and leave both of them on my hair while I shower. The extra time and probably steam/heat really helps too.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Conditioners Kerastase makes.  Although my hair is not &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; it is damaged and fragile, and this conditioner did the trick.  Very effective product with a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great Product as well as the conditioner.  i have been using for over a year and it really makes a difference in your hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several weeks now.  Although it is a good conditioner with a pleasant smell, I can&#x27;t justify its high price. I keep hoping that with time I will see some amazing improvement!!  For now, though, I&#x27;m not so impressed.</li>
    <li> I am hooked. Been using it so long I don&#x27;t honestly remember why I got hooked. I do know my hair doesn&#x27;t look dry and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t make it heavy (use both shampoo and conditioner)</li>
    <li> This conditioner is all that it says claims to be.  Love it.  But hard to find and&lt;br /&gt;very expensive.  The one saving factor is - a little bit goes a long way.  Unfortunately,&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked.  Thank you Amazon for supplying it!</li>
    <li> I tried this product twice and was disappointed both times.  I contacted the seller to see if I could replace with another Kerastase product and they said they could not since the product was open.  I don&#x27;t understand how you can determine if you like a product without trying it. So, buyer beware!  This is one instance where purchasing from a store is better than online as the store will allow the product to be returned if not satisfied.</li>
    <li> I use this with Bain Satin 2 and I love it!  It is perfect for everyday as it does not weigh my thin hair down!</li>
