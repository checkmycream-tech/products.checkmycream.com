### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Since I use Neutrogena Intensives Tone Corrector SPF 30 as a moisturizer (cream based), the products would mix and turn into what&#x27;s best described as eraser shavings and fall off my face.  </li>
      <li>I was so impressed by this product that I showed it to my dermatologist.</li>
      <li>this works very good</li>
      <li>Great product use it every day, ordered a replacement</li>
      <li>I will continue to use and amazon is a great place to get it from.</li>
      <li>stuff feels great and soaks into pores.</li>
      <li>Got it at Amazon at a great price.</li>
      <li>You are able to get the perfect amount you need every time.</li>
      <li>now then they were before, and that&#x27;s good.  </li>
      <li>and I think it clogged my pores, bringing me more oil production and blackheads.</li>
      <li>I dont see a difference, exfoliating and astringents seems to do a much better job.</li>
      <li>I got around this by just unscrewing the top and dabbing the product onto my finger off of the pump straw.</li>
      <li>but I had better luck shrinking my pore size by using a serum and a clay mask.</li>
      <li>Absolutely as described and more!</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
      <li>It does a good job of mattifying and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This product has reduced the diameter of my pores significantly.  </li>
      <li>It hydrates my skin and leaves a clean feeling after usage.  </li>
      <li>It does not seem to do much of anything except create more oil on the skin.</li>
      <li>It perfectly moisturizes and my skin has been looking a lot nicer lately.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product, but has its limitations.</li>
      <li>There should be a logical reason many have larger pores, maybe we need to release more sebum.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost two months now regularly so I could provide adequate and honest feedback.</li>
      <li>but it helps my skin feel fresh all day</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try for anyone.</li>
      <li>If you really want to clean out and tighten your pores, I&#x27;d recommend [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>The tips from other reviewers regarding rubbing in until dry for best performance is spot on!</li>
      <li>Also, it goes on nicely and is not greasy and it only takes a dab to cover your whole face</li>
      <li>The effect is very good and great is a little expensive.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be ordering more.  </li>
      <li>Glad I tried this first as I expect with continued use the sixe of my pores to get even smaller.  </li>
      <li>This serum did make me break out a bit for the first couple of days</li>
      <li>but I thought I would give this a try first before shelling out a $1,000 for that treatment.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use a 2nd moisturizer as this serum has many moisturizing elements in it already.</li>
      <li>You have to use this product consistently to see pore reducing effect.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe if you use it continuously, your pores may \\&quot;adapt\\&quot; to being smaller, but I think it&#x27;s more of a temporary remedy.</li>
      <li>However, for it to work effectively, you need to empty your pores and let this serum work from the inside.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been too fastidious about making sure I apply it twice a day, either, definitely once though</li>
      <li>Really works!  </li>
      <li>After LESS than a week of using the serum twice daily on my nose, under the eyes, and my forehead, the difference it&#x27;s making is very apparent and welcome :)</li>
      <li>first cleaned my face with Clean &amp; Clear with the beads and hot water which works very well.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this product since most of Japanese skin care product really works well for my skin</li>
      <li>I first purchased this because I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>and I have large pores.</li>
      <li>I have large pores on my T area</li>
      <li>I agree with other reviewers that your pores must be clear before using this because the main thing it is good at is keeping them from filling up again.</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;m happy to report that either I&#x27;ve found a secret, or I&#x27;m just an exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really notice a difference in pore size</li>
      <li>When it dries it really pulls and tightens and visibly reduces pore size for a while.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s working or not.</li>
      <li>really like this product.</li>
      <li>I do notice shrinking of my pores (though not as much as the product seems to promise).</li>
      <li>Pores didn&#x27;t change much, even though I used this and the rest of the line twice a day for over two months.</li>
      <li>haha.  </li>
      <li>then I started noticing the changes, it works very well for me, I like it</li>
      <li>But I still really like, I will buy them.</li>
      <li>I use it on my whole face and my skin feels tighter, cleaner and smoother for days afterwards.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now, and I honestly see no difference in how my pores look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was discouraged reading other people&#x27;s reviews, as most of them said that this did nothing for the pores on their nose.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, it created a red sore spot on the top of my nose that is starting to go away now after one month.</li>
      <li>If I very lightly push the pump down I barely get a drop at a time and if I push it down slightly more I get way more product than I can possibly use on my face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 29 year old women with very oily, acne prone skin that is plagued by large pores all over my cheeks, nose, forehead, and temples.</li>
      <li>its okay, but makes my face feel slightly greasy</li>
      <li>I had high hopes</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I had pretty low expectations.</li>
      <li>This pore reducing serum works well for me, I didn&#x27;t notice any changes the first and second time I applied it,  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Asian, 31 and pretty oily in the T-Zones.  </li>
      <li>Sure my skin felt a little bit tighter but nothing major.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>or so I paid, but for the current $7.95, it may be worth it if your pores are a major concern.</li>
      <li>or if it&#x27;s just residue from the serum itself, but my pores are still there, and the annoyingly large one in the middle of my nose has not shrunk.  </li>
      <li>After I used the Kyoku pore reducing serum for a couple weeks, the black heads on my pore strip significantly reduced to the point where I thought the strip wasn&#x27;t even working.  </li>
      <li>This substance is clear, viscous and a bit sticky/tacky to the touch.</li>
      <li>So far I like it.  </li>
      <li>(They Don&#x27;t Disappear Completely)</li>
      <li>and this really helps to make them smaller for ~18 hours at a time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To achieve success, I use a blackhead removing adhesive strip to empty the pores, and I immediately use the serum after removing the strip.</li>
      <li>While I think that it is possible you&#x27;d be able to find other products that do a similar job, I do not think they&#x27;ve had the thought put into them that this product has.  </li>
      <li>I tried Kyoku because I&#x27;m a white male with very large pores in his nose.</li>
      <li>When I wake up, I noticed that my pores are much smaller and less noticeable and my face is really smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>I think if you clean your face then apply, the serum dries and tightens, thus possibly giving the appearance of slightly smaller pores, but once it wears or is washed off, you&#x27;re back to the same as before.</li>
      <li>I do really feel that my pores appear smaller several weeks in</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a while now, and I am still not noticing a major difference.  </li>
      <li>Apparently some doctor in US or UK came up with this.</li>
      <li>After a few weeks of using this serum I have to say that I do think it is worth it.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is the applicator dispenses quite a dollop of the product, easily twice what I require, with each press.</li>
      <li>only major gripe I have with this is the packaging.</li>
      <li>Some days it seems like my pores are smaller, other days it seems like they&#x27;re normal sized</li>

<li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my pores at all, probably because they are massive, but I still use this after cleaning my face before bed, and sometimes in the mornings if my skin feels a little dry.</li>
<li> I do agree with other reviewers that said you should try and void your pores of any excess gunk and black heads first before using.  </li>
<li> Not sure if my skin just didn&#x27;t like the Kyoku line or if it just really didn&#x27;t like this serum.</li>
<li> How are you going to reduce a pore&#x27;s size when you have a big ole oily blackhead keeping it open wide?</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t think it was that big of a deal due to the fact that the product was only $8 but now seeing that it has increased to $15</li>
<li> Also, the pump system, either squirts out way too much or too little, so you waste or you don&#x27;t get enough!  </li>
<li> I will finish the product and see if it helps long term but</li>
<li> It also left a slight shine to my nose that I didn&#x27;t like, so I only used it at night while sleeping.&lt;br</li>
<li> And to be honest I&#x27;m not sure I know how to measure pore size, but results were unnoticed and possibly worse.</li>
<li> There were several poor reviews and, really, Kyoku products can be hit or miss, but this one is a winner.</li>
<li> I tried going back to it after a few weeks with the same results.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am using this under Kyoku Oil Control Lotion. It seems to be working well. It makes my skin feel smooth. My pores are reducing in size. I have ordered a second bottle to give it an extended try. I use this with salicylic acid on my nose and the combination is making my blackheads 75% less.</li>
    <li> Have seen very little if any results after regular usage. Not sure if my regular hygiene routine interferes with this?</li>
    <li> I do notice shrinking of my pores (though not as much as the product seems to promise). The tips from other reviewers regarding rubbing in until dry for best performance is spot on!</li>
    <li> After a month of use I can tell a difference. My pores on my nose and cheek have gotten smaller.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this after an article in Men&#x27;s Health and reading a bit about the creator of the brand and his theories/research.  I must say, this works or it&#x27;s working for me at this point in time.  I&#x27;m Asian, 31 and pretty oily in the T-Zones.  I always use the nose pore strips to get rid of those black heads and there are a TON on my nose area, like a freaking forest! haha.  After I used the Kyoku pore reducing serum for a couple weeks, the black heads on my pore strip significantly reduced to the point where I thought the strip wasn&#x27;t even working.  I&#x27;ll keep trying to see if anything changes and will update this post, but at this point...it has reduced serum on my pores as claimed!!!</li>
    <li> I noticed no difference at all with this product. Was real waste of money. Sure my skin felt a little bit tighter but nothing major. Product also started to flake and ball up on skin. Looked like my skin was peeling, definitely not a good look. Just trying to use it up now. Definitely do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Some products work well for some people while it doesn&#x27;t work well for others, I think it depends on your body chemistry. This pore reducing serum works well for me, I didn&#x27;t notice any changes the first and second time I applied it,  then I started noticing the changes, it works very well for me, I like it, I only apply it once a day after I shower just before bed. When I wake up, I noticed that my pores are much smaller and less noticeable and my face is really smooth and soft.  I will definitely be ordering more.  It does work for me.</li>
    <li> Not sure if my skin just didn&#x27;t like the Kyoku line or if it just really didn&#x27;t like this serum. Pores didn&#x27;t change much, even though I used this and the rest of the line twice a day for over two months. Gave it away. The line is not dry skin friendly, which was my bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old women with very oily, acne prone skin that is plagued by large pores all over my cheeks, nose, forehead, and temples. After a few weeks of using this serum I have to say that I do think it is worth it. I agree with other reviewers that your pores must be clear before using this because the main thing it is good at is keeping them from filling up again. This serum did make me break out a bit for the first couple of days but since then I&#x27;ve had no issue. It does a good job of mattifying and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I do really feel that my pores appear smaller several weeks in, it is especially noticeable on my nose and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only major gripe I have with this is the packaging. It is really difficult to get a manageable amount out of the bottle with the pump on this. If I very lightly push the pump down I barely get a drop at a time and if I push it down slightly more I get way more product than I can possibly use on my face. The serum is almost gel-like in consistency so it sticks to itself, which makes it hard to propel a small amount out of the pump.</li>
    <li> Slippery upon application and caused breakouts. Never buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> This product has reduced the diameter of my pores significantly.  While I think that it is possible you&#x27;d be able to find other products that do a similar job, I do not think they&#x27;ve had the thought put into them that this product has.  I will continue to use and amazon is a great place to get it from.</li>
    <li> I have male asian combination skin.  This product definitely reduced pore size.  However, I had to change up my skin care product routine.  The consistency is like sticky tar, and it is not compatible with cream/opaque type products.  It&#x27;s suppose to be applied before your moisturizer  Since I use Neutrogena Intensives Tone Corrector SPF 30 as a moisturizer (cream based), the products would mix and turn into what&#x27;s best described as eraser shavings and fall off my face.  So, in order not to waste product, I use this product with a gel based moisturizer at night.  I don&#x27;t need SPF at night, so I use a gel moisturizer with salysilic acid and melatin blocker and it blends well with the serum.</li>
    <li> Here is why I don&#x27;t like it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It does not work. My pores are the same size.&lt;br /&gt;- It smells like glue.&lt;br /&gt;- It does NOT mix with Kyoku moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;- It leaves a glossy film-like residue on the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m honestly not sure what this product actually does anymore...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now, and I honestly see no difference in how my pores look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong, if someone can fill me in.</li>
    <li> stuff feels great and soaks into pores. Not sure if its working entirely but I like the way it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> Goes on without a greasy feeling at all. Got it at Amazon at a great price. Definitely worth a try for anyone.</li>
    <li> I didnt notice anything. And to be honest I&#x27;m not sure I know how to measure pore size, but results were unnoticed and possibly worse. And its slimy.</li>
    <li> The battle was half way OPENDED, some of the liquid was flow out. Also the nozzle was not working. I don&#x27;t know how can I use this thing.</li>
    <li> I am not sure about this product.  It&#x27;s thick and I think it clogged my pores, bringing me more oil production and blackheads. There should be a logical reason many have larger pores, maybe we need to release more sebum.</li>
    <li> Thinkonh I may like this product..time will tell.</li>
    <li> Absolutely as described and more! Everyone who&#x27;s on the fence try this now! You will not be disappointed at all!</li>
    <li> I have used the kyoku product and it has decreased my pore&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> It does not seem to do much of anything except create more oil on the skin. As those of us with enlarged pores we also have oily skin. Within in a few minuets my skin is even oilier than without the product. I will finish the product and see if it helps long term but short term is not good for my skin.</li>
    <li> This product is not effective if you have acne except maybe one blemish?? It did not clear up even that!!</li>
    <li> This substance is clear, viscous and a bit sticky/tacky to the touch. I think if you clean your face then apply, the serum dries and tightens, thus possibly giving the appearance of slightly smaller pores, but once it wears or is washed off, you&#x27;re back to the same as before. It also left a slight shine to my nose that I didn&#x27;t like, so I only used it at night while sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you use it continuously, your pores may \\&quot;adapt\\&quot; to being smaller, but I think it&#x27;s more of a temporary remedy. If you really want to clean out and tighten your pores, I&#x27;d recommend [[ASIN:B0014P8L9W Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing, 1 Pound]]. It&#x27;s a bentonite clay powder that you mix with water or vinegar and apply as a mask. When it dries it really pulls and tightens and visibly reduces pore size for a while. Your skin may be red for a little while after using it, but it cleans and tightens like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried. I use it on my whole face and my skin feels tighter, cleaner and smoother for days afterwards. You have to keep using it, but it works. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this Kyoku serum again for the $15 or so I paid, but for the current $7.95, it may be worth it if your pores are a major concern. It&#x27;s not a bad product, but has its limitations.</li>
    <li> Reduces Pore Size as Advertised Careful as Not a Lot is Needed and a Big pump will mean Wasted Product, More is not Better !!! Not a Miracle (They Don&#x27;t Disappear Completely) Size is Reduced as Advertised</li>
    <li> I have been using the Kyoku pore reducing serum for 2 weeks now and I can definitely tell a difference in the size of my pores.  My Dermatologist had suggested a pricey peel to reduce my pores but I thought I would give this a try first before shelling out a $1,000 for that treatment.  Glad I tried this first as I expect with continued use the sixe of my pores to get even smaller.  I do agree with other reviewers that said you should try and void your pores of any excess gunk and black heads first before using.  I highly recommend this product.  Also, it goes on nicely and is not greasy and it only takes a dab to cover your whole face so one bottle should last several months.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this because I have very oily skin and I have large pores. I bought it because it was only $9 and I thought why not. It works well when you first apply it, but the moment you get any perspiration going on, it seems like it doesn&#x27;t work at keeping your pores small anymore. They look like they looked before I used it. So I guess it works well for short periods of time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really notice a difference in pore size but it helps my skin feel fresh all day so I give it 5 star.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now, and I am still not noticing a major difference.  I use it as directed with moisturizer, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  I also don&#x27;t know if the slight peeling is from the product actually working or if it&#x27;s just residue from the serum itself, but my pores are still there, and the annoyingly large one in the middle of my nose has not shrunk.  I hoped this would fix it, but I guess I need to find another alternative.</li>
    <li> Great product use it every day, ordered a replacement</li>
    <li> Really works!  I have large pores on my T area and this really helps to make them smaller for ~18 hours at a time.</li>
    <li> This product did work, I noticed results after about a week. Agree with another reviewer, you have to empty/squeeze the sebum out of your pores before applying product. HOWEVER, this product caused my skin to peel so badly I had to discontinue using. I tried going back to it after a few weeks with the same results. Quite a shame because I threw out the majority of the bottle - which was pretty expensive. 2 stars because it did work, but only 2 because the side effect was too severe.</li>
    <li> This product actually works. I had pretty low expectations. There were several poor reviews and, really, Kyoku products can be hit or miss, but this one is a winner. I haven&#x27;t been too fastidious about making sure I apply it twice a day, either, definitely once though and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now. There&#x27;s an appreciable improvement in the appearance of the pores on my nose: they&#x27;re less there now then they were before, and that&#x27;s good.  My only complaint is the applicator dispenses quite a dollop of the product, easily twice what I require, with each press.</li>
    <li> So far I like it.  It hydrates my skin and leaves a clean feeling after usage.  You have to use this product consistently to see pore reducing effect.  I am giving it 4 stars since the product&#x27;s effect on reducing pore seems bit weak.  But overall, i would recommend!</li>
    <li> The effect is very good and great is a little expensive. But I still really like, I will buy them.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s working or not. Some days it seems like my pores are smaller, other days it seems like they&#x27;re normal sized</li>
    <li> Spreading some hair gel on your face would probably get the same result... sticky and shiny.</li>
    <li> My Man loves this product!</li>
    <li> Thought it may be a lower cost solution for my pricy Clinique Pore Reducing Serum.  I was wrong.  Discarded the product after two applications.  Definitely not for oily skin.  Will continue to splurge on Clinique.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product since most of Japanese skin care product really works well for my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;It sounds Japanese, and even the container looks Japanese but NOT! Apparently some doctor in US or UK came up with this.</li>
    <li> What junk! First off, it smells terrible and you use this on your nose! Not a good combo.  Also, the pump system, either squirts out way too much or too little, so you waste or you don&#x27;t get enough!  I don&#x27;t see results.  Trash.</li>
    <li> I tried Kyoku because I&#x27;m a white male with very large pores in his nose. I was discouraged reading other people&#x27;s reviews, as most of them said that this did nothing for the pores on their nose. Well, I&#x27;m happy to report that either I&#x27;ve found a secret, or I&#x27;m just an exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyoku pore reducing serum DOES work as advertised. However, for it to work effectively, you need to empty your pores and let this serum work from the inside. How are you going to reduce a pore&#x27;s size when you have a big ole oily blackhead keeping it open wide? You have to take the physical blackhead out of the equation, first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To achieve success, I use a blackhead removing adhesive strip to empty the pores, and I immediately use the serum after removing the strip. I don&#x27;t use a 2nd moisturizer as this serum has many moisturizing elements in it already. After LESS than a week of using the serum twice daily on my nose, under the eyes, and my forehead, the difference it&#x27;s making is very apparent and welcome :)</li>
    <li> One of the few men&#x27;s skin care products that actually works as advertised. Well worth the price and lasts a long time. I was so impressed by this product that I showed it to my dermatologist. She now sells it in her office also. Use it everyday and you will see a visible difference in the reduction of pores.</li>
    <li> I used this for one month now and it didn&#x27;t do anything and I was hoping that it would reduce the size of the pores around my eyes and nose some. I know it won&#x27;t take them 100% away but I was looking for at least 30-40% reduction but got zero.&lt;br /&gt;I first cleaned my face with Clean &amp; Clear with the beads and hot water which works very well. No instructions was written on the bottle on how to use it. So I took a guess and put on a thick layer of the gel. The first time I used it, it created a red sore spot on the top of my nose that is starting to go away now after one month. I&#x27;ve never had a sore on my nose before. Sometimes the gel would dry out my skin really bad but non-scented lotion fixed that.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice anything different. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> its okay, but makes my face feel slightly greasy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost two months now regularly so I could provide adequate and honest feedback. I must say I never noticed any  changes with the appearance or size of the pores on my T-zone. After application, I did notice the skin felt tighter and itched quite a bit but pores remained the same size. I didn&#x27;t think it was that big of a deal due to the fact that the product was only $8 but now seeing that it has increased to $15, I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> really like this product. it makes my pores close tight without makeing my skin red or irritated. this works very good and i  feel makes a big difference in how my skin looks and feels.</li>
    <li> After following the usage directions for several months, I haven&#x27;t noticed any change at all.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I dont see a difference, exfoliating and astringents seems to do a much better job.</li>
    <li> this product works as defined</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my pores at all, probably because they are massive, but I still use this after cleaning my face before bed, and sometimes in the mornings if my skin feels a little dry. It perfectly moisturizes and my skin has been looking a lot nicer lately. The only thing that bothered me initially was the pump. You&#x27;ll probably see a lot of other reviews saying the pump is terrible, and it is. I got around this by just unscrewing the top and dabbing the product onto my finger off of the pump straw. You are able to get the perfect amount you need every time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this worked for me. I had high hopes but I had better luck shrinking my pore size by using a serum and a clay mask.</li>
</ol>
