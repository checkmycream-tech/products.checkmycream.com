      <li>much more info</li>
      <li>It has what I feel is the perfect texture for scrubbing one&#x27;s back.</li>
      <li>Because of the length of the scrubber, he was able to use it without aggravating his shoulder.  </li>
      <li>needed a way to scrub my back and this does a great job and feels good doing it.</li>
      <li>AND IF IT IS SAFE TO USE.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay but not as good or useful as the one I&#x27;m trying to replace.</li>
      <li>Had this for many years and was quite functional, and durable.  </li>
      <li>I love it and wonder why I didn&#x27;t get one years ago.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Nothing more to say except -&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
      <li>It can be used on most parts of the body.</li>
      <li>The length is perfect for people with limited mobility.  </li>
      <li>The product description did not have many of the important details about this product, so I will describe them:&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t soap up easily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so appreciative of the first reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The scrubbing material is very effective and feels wonderful - delightfully rough, so as to actually relieve the itch!</li>
      <li>I´ve had mind for 18 months and it does as good a job now as when brand new.  </li>
      <li>Experiment on how much pressure and how many times to use it over one area before you start feeling like you&#x27;ve got road burn or something like it!</li>
      <li>Also works great for a do it yourself back scratcher</li>
      <li>The Plastic strips are cheap.  </li>
      <li>I must say I loved the first review thanks for that!</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t like being the first person to buy a product unseen without being able to handle the item before purchase.  </li>
      <li>Also a good back scratcher.</li>
      <li>I was somewhat relunctant thinking the amount of nylon would not be enough to get the feeling of a good scrub</li>
      <li>This back scrubber does a good job retaining liquid soap and the correct amount of water.  </li>
      <li>it does a fair job of cleaning your back, but is way too long even for a feeling good size person.</li>
      <li>It rinses well and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>Works perfect and its long length actually makes it usable.  </li>
      <li>I used it the first time, I couldn&#x27;t get it to develop that rich lather I read in some description or review,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy for me to do most of my back with this item.</li>
      <li>It is a heavy terry cloth and those scrubbing strips are great.</li>
      <li>He really likes this product and would recommend it to others looking for a good substantial back scrubber.</li>
      <li>The fabric is very, very dense while still being rather soft.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>I  LIKE THIS VERY MUCH AND HAVE BEEN USING IT EVER</li>
      <li>The wide handles also are handy.</li>
      <li>;-)  </li>
      <li>so I appreciate that person&lt;br /&gt;being willing to be the guinea pig for the rest of us.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite possible that it will lather up better</li>
      <li>so be sure to consider the length of it relative to your size</li>
      <li>They may NOT be for delicate skin but they are great for me.</li>
      <li>The nylon part feels ok on my back.</li>
      <li>&gt; still use it on occasion but my back brush does a better job.</li>
      <li>I most certainly would buy this back scrubber again, recommend it to friends, recommend it to family, and buy it as a gift for someone I care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However as I said, those brown stripes of nylon cross wise of the strap CAN make you feel road burned if you don&#x27;t have that hairy back to protect your skin.  </li>
      <li>thing I DID notice is that those little brown strips of looped nylon are pretty effective at digging into the skin and could if you used it too much in any given area (kept moving it back and forth too many times in the same location) you could quickly scrape your skin right off!  </li>
      <li>given that quite often the first time you try to use anything like this it doesn&#x27;t soap up as easily due to the sizing that is in most fabric when you first get it.  </li>
      <li>it if you want to scrub your back &amp; neck and do it easily &amp; thoroughly.</li>
      <li>I bought another one for my 87 year old father who has flexibility issues and, because of the extra length, he&#x27;s able to easily use it on his back.</li>
      <li>extra length is also really important and is much needed in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Works really well.</li>
      <li>Resists mildew and dries fast.  </li>
      <li>I find the &amp;#34;net&amp;#34; style with a handle much easier/handier to use.</li>
      <li>I bought this fantastic back scrubber.  </li>
      <li>So I got as much soap onto the strap as I could</li>
      <li>Dig a hole into your hide, so don&#x27;t use it too taut with too much pressure and keep it moving around when you start using it.  </li>
      <li>Very time consuming</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>Very well made.</li>
      <li>Seems to have too much fabric.  </li>
      <li>A brush is much quicker.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not used it again since the first time or with the new bar of soap.  </li>
      <li>Which is generally why I wash everything prior to using most things.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Sorry I can&#x27;t be more helpful beyond letting you know that the nap on this is NOT very long at all, and the brown strips of nylon loops are not long either, not any longer than the terry or if it is, it&#x27;s microscopically so.  </li>
      <li>In fact, when I looked online, most were the same length as the short one.  </li>
      <li>Now that I am getting older</li>
      <li>and it may glide right across them which would mean apply more pressure and</li>
      <li>is well made and long enough for easy use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have a pretty sensitive back</li>
      <li>Even the plastic handles are strong, stiff, and not flexible.  </li>
      <li>now for really really large person maybe the extra length would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>really like the back scrubber and the brown strips</li>
      <li>bear that in mind if you have sensitive</li>
      <li>The entirety of the back scrubber is very durable and well made.  </li>
      <li>Too long for an average size person otherwise it would be ok  </li>
      <li>The total length of the back scrubber, including both handles plus the fabric, is 42.5 inches (3.25 inches of right handle + 36 inches of fabric +</li>
      <li>Granted the soap wasn&#x27;t a brand new bar, it was getting close to being  the sliver size I would generally move out of the shower into a sink soap dish.  </li>
      <li>THIS EXTRA LONG SCRUBBER IS FINE FOR ME SINCE MY ARMS ARE SHORT.</li>
      <li>It could be useful dry when you have an itchy back too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is long and stretchy and there is too much material to rinse out.</li>
      <li>It say&#x27;s this is extra long, but it is only five inches longer than the one I picked up at the local Walmart, and it works fine.</li>
      <li>and then wrung out as much of the soapy water and lather as I could from the flour sack dishtowel I use as a wash cloth prior to this to wash my back with.  </li>
      <li>The plastic handles&#x27; inflexibility prevents the fabric from bunching-up at the handle, while ensuring the entire width of the scrubber positively contacts and lies flat on one&#x27;s back during use.&lt;br /</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was looking for something to replace my scrub brush that just doesn&#x27;t have enough oomph!  This back scrubber does the job.  When you look at the photos you wonder how those little strips can really scrub your back, but they do.  My only problem is that I used the brush to scrub my legs/arms/feet and I can&#x27;t do that with this type of scrubber.  I do roll it in a ball and use it like a cloth to scrub where needed.  Love it!</li>
    <li> It works great and gets well used. Now that I am getting older I have difficult washing by bade and this does the job</li>
    <li> this thing stretched out after a couple uses. it does a fair job of cleaning your back, but is way too long even for a feeling good size person. now for really really large person maybe the extra length would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; still use it on occasion but my back brush does a better job.</li>
    <li> this product is too long for my mother, it was a bad choice for her,she uses it but with some difficulty.</li>
    <li> If you like an agressive, rough back scrubber, this is the one.  I´ve had mind for 18 months and it does as good a job now as when brand new.  Very well made. No other back scrubber I´ve tried has lasted as well.  Resists mildew and dries fast.  Relieves the itch back you get after a sweaty day of work or an athletic workout.</li>
    <li> I use it a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;It is well made and long enough for easy use.&lt;br /&gt;I needed a way to scrub my back and this does a great job and feels good doing it.</li>
    <li> This scrubber is long enough for a 6&#x27;-7&amp;#34; guy like me. The nylon part feels ok on my back. Not too rough.</li>
    <li> Like the scrubby feeling on back, butt and legs. Also a good back scratcher. The wide handles also are handy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product but it&#x27;s not 44&amp;#34; long.  It&#x27;s 36&amp;#34; and stretches to about 40&amp;#34;.  I like it but the description is wrong.</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR FOLKS WITH ANY TYPE OF R/A  TO HEAVY AND AKWARD  DIDNT USE IT BUT ONE TIME.</li>
    <li> Bottom Line: I most certainly would buy this back scrubber again, recommend it to friends, recommend it to family, and buy it as a gift for someone I care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like being the first person to buy a product unseen without being able to handle the item before purchase.  When I found this back scrubber, there were no review for it yet.  As a rule, I don&#x27;t usually buy a product unless it has been reviewed yet.  Even so, I decided to take a a risk and buy this back scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The risk paid off very well, and I am very happy I bought this fantastic back scrubber.  The product description did not have many of the important details about this product, so I will describe them:&lt;br /&gt;*  The entirety of the back scrubber is very durable and well made.  Even the plastic handles are strong, stiff, and not flexible.  I believe squeezing the soap and water out of this back scrubber will not affect how long it will last.&lt;br /&gt;*  The front of the back scrubber is identical to the rear side of the back scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;*  The fabric is very, very dense while still being rather soft.&lt;br /&gt;*  The fabric and handles are both 4 inches wide.&lt;br /&gt;*  The total length of the back scrubber including both handles is 42.5 inches.&lt;br /&gt;*  The fabric part alone is 36 inches, and can stretch to 37 inches at most.&lt;br /&gt;*  The fabric has 8 strips of brown 0.5 inch wide exfoliating material sewn on perpendicular to the length of the back scrubber.  The exfoliating strips are 1.25 inches apart, and are on both sides of the back scrubber.  The exfoliating strips are centered in the length of the back scrubber, and occupy 12.75 inches of the total length of the back scrubber.  The highly effective exfoliating material is like a dense mesh bath pouf.  I had no problems, injury, nor marked discomfort caused by using the exfoliating strips; despite my having fragile, tissue-paper-thin skin.&lt;br /&gt;*  The handles are each 3.25 inches long.  Both handles together add a total of 6.6inches to the length of the back scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;*  The total length of the back scrubber, including both handles plus the fabric, is 42.5 inches (3.25 inches of right handle + 36 inches of fabric + 3.25 inches of left handle &#x3D; 42.5 inches).  I have an average, adult arm span and I found the length of the back scrubber to be the correct length for me.  It is short enough that I could get the fabric taut on my back for consistent, firm contact with my back.  It is long enough that I can use it without contorting my body of feeling cramped.&lt;br /&gt;*  The plastic handles&#x27; inflexibility prevents the fabric from bunching-up at the handle, while ensuring the entire width of the scrubber positively contacts and lies flat on one&#x27;s back during use.&lt;br /&gt;*  This back scrubber does a good job retaining liquid soap and the correct amount of water.  When using this back scrubber, I always  had enough soap and the back scrubber stayed wet for the entire time I cleaned my back.&lt;br /&gt;*  When the back scrubber drys out after use, it has no detectable smell.&lt;br /&gt;*  Rinses well.&lt;br /&gt;*  When I received the back scrubber, it had no detectable smell.&lt;br /&gt;*  Machine washable (delicate cycle suggested), hang dry.&lt;br /&gt;*  The unit I received was slightly different in color only from the product photo.  My unit has brown handles that were the same color as the brown exfoliating strips.  The product photo shows beige handles.  The fabric is beige.</li>
    <li> I use this exfoliator on my back while i use a brush elsewhere. It&#x27;s easy for me to do most of my back with this item.</li>
    <li> I am trying to replace a loofah type back scrubber that was thrown out by she who must be obeyed because it was &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;.  Had this for many years and was quite functional, and durable.  This scrubber falls short.  It is longer than necessary, not strong enough, and has handles which make it awkward to use.  The terry cloth is just that...not functional as a scrubber.  The Plastic strips are cheap.  Still on my quest.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality scrubber.  The length is perfect for people with limited mobility.  It rinses well and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> I  LIKE THIS VERY MUCH AND HAVE BEEN USING IT EVER SINCE I BOUGHT IT.&lt;br /&gt;NOW THAT TIME HAS GONE BY, BLUE IS SHOWING THROUGH THE TERRY CLOTH.  IT IS SHOWING UP DOWN BY THE HANDLES.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE ADVISE IF THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS AND IF IT IS SAFE TO USE.  SINCE IT IS NOW TOO LATE FOR YOU TO TAKE IT BACK, CAN YOU SEND ME ANOTHER ONE TO TRY?  I INITIALLY DID BUY 2, BUT HAVEN&#x27;T USED THE OTHER ONE YET, FOR FEAR OF THE  SAME THING HAPPENING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S A SHAME, SINCE WHEN I SAW IT, I THOUGHT IT WAS A GODSEND, SINCE I HAVE VERY POOR MOBILITY IN MY ARMS AND THIS IS PERFECT TO USE IN THE SHOWER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE DO SOMETHING FOR ME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GERI GRECO</li>
    <li> THIS EXTRA LONG SCRUBBER IS FINE FOR ME SINCE MY ARMS ARE SHORT. I AM ABLE TO WASH AND LOTION ON MY OWN W/O ASSISTANCE</li>
    <li> Works perfect and its long length actually makes it usable.  I had previously ordered another elsewhere - too short.  You had to be a contortionist to reach the handles.  In fact, when I looked online, most were the same length as the short one.  The scrubbing material is very effective and feels wonderful - delightfully rough, so as to actually relieve the itch!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so appreciative of the first reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;I hate purchasing something that has no reviews so I appreciate that person&lt;br /&gt;being willing to be the guinea pig for the rest of us.&lt;br /&gt;The first reviewer did a perfect job and even edited the review to&lt;br /&gt;add much more info so I endorse everything that was shared in that 1st review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the back scrubber and the brown strips are really great for the scrub.&lt;br /&gt;Just remember that those strips are on both sides&lt;br /&gt;so bear that in mind if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra length is also really important and is much needed in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I imagine how difficult a shorter one this style would be to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing more to say except -&lt;br /&gt;Buy it if you want to scrub your back &amp; neck and do it easily &amp; thoroughly.</li>
    <li> This product is not for those with tender skin. It will rake what skin you have off in chunks. Painful, actually.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. But the exfoliating strips are a harsh plastic and scratches.  A brush is much quicker. This is long and stretchy and there is too much material to rinse out. Very time consuming</li>
    <li> When I got the &amp;#34;Extra Long Exfoliating Back Scrubber&amp;#34; Terry with nylon bands back scrubber strap, I was a bit disappointed with the lack of fluffiness aka thinness of the product as compared to the picture, but it&#x27;s about 1/4&amp;#34; thick as measured at the side.  Since it&#x27;s rounded that&#x27;s just a guesstimate as best as I can get with a tape measure.  The weave is good and dense, probably why it doesn&#x27;t look so &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34;  If the weave was looser, it would likely be a longer loop on the terry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know someone else on one of their reviews gave the length of the product as 44&amp;#34; I just measured it from one handle to the end of the other handle if stretched taut, I could get it to 36, just the fabric component part of the strap is 30&amp;#34; stretched taut. However these measurements are AFTER it&#x27;s been used and so wet down and rinsed and allowed to dry hanging across a grab bar.  It&#x27;s quite likely there may have been some degree of shrinkage. As I did not measure it prior to use, I cannot swear to that.  Width of the strap is 4 1/4&amp;#34; at either end just below or inside the stitching where it&#x27;s attached to the handles.  However half way between the 4th and 5th brown band of nylon looping the width of the band is 3 7/8&amp;#34; relaxed.  If I grab hold of either side of the strap I can stretch it out to 4&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it the first time, I couldn&#x27;t get it to develop that rich lather I read in some description or review, not sure which.  Granted the soap wasn&#x27;t a brand new bar, it was getting close to being  the sliver size I would generally move out of the shower into a sink soap dish.  So I got as much soap onto the strap as I could and then wrung out as much of the soapy water and lather as I could from the flour sack dishtowel I use as a wash cloth prior to this to wash my back with.  I put that soapy lather over this and used it that way.  I&#x27;ve not used it again since the first time or with the new bar of soap.  It&#x27;s quite possible that it will lather up better given that quite often the first time you try to use anything like this it doesn&#x27;t soap up as easily due to the sizing that is in most fabric when you first get it.  Which is generally why I wash everything prior to using most things.  I didn&#x27;t toss this into the washer because of the plastic handles and given that it&#x27;s main use is in a wet soapy environment I figured I&#x27;d let the shower do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I DID notice is that those little brown strips of looped nylon are pretty effective at digging into the skin and could if you used it too much in any given area (kept moving it back and forth too many times in the same location) you could quickly scrape your skin right off!  Dig a hole into your hide, so don&#x27;t use it too taut with too much pressure and keep it moving around when you start using it.  Experiment on how much pressure and how many times to use it over one area before you start feeling like you&#x27;ve got road burn or something like it! ;-)  If you have thin or tender skin this may not be for you.  If you have tanned a lot or have pretty thick hide and need to scrub off some of that dried out leather called tanned skin,  well then it may be just the thing for you!  It could be useful dry when you have an itchy back too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how hard it would be on a hairy back...as in if the hair might get hooked on the nylon stripes.  However the loop is NOT that long.  However I do think a hairy back could serve to protect the skin from them and it may glide right across them which would mean apply more pressure and reps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something that feels rough, this is NOT the product.  However as I said, those brown stripes of nylon cross wise of the strap CAN make you feel road burned if you don&#x27;t have that hairy back to protect your skin.  So just how rough or effective this can or will be for you is again, subjective and something too rough for one could feel like nothing at all but a piece of material and like you&#x27;re merely trying to buff your back.  So you need to realize that only YOU can take a wild guess about it&#x27;s possible use to you.  It&#x27;s NOT just terry cloth.  But it&#x27;s not deeply textured and rough like something like the sisal brush like texture may give you.  That would be akin to several strips of rough new rope lined up next to one another being drug back and forth over the back.. only rougher since the length of the sisal fibers look longer on the sisal strap I saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say to use this terry/nylon strip back band in conjunction with a brush ..maybe not the same night, but if you DO use th em together the same night, use the brush first in case the nylon makes your back ktender..then .. trying to use a brush after it, your back may be a bit tender and could object.. at least in those areas that the nylon dug into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry I can&#x27;t be more helpful beyond letting you know that the nap on this is NOT very long at all, and the brown strips of nylon loops are not long either, not any longer than the terry or if it is, it&#x27;s microscopically so.  It&#x27;s not velour as the nap or weave is not so close to be dense and it&#x27;s not trimmed to form a velvet like texture like you would find on velour.  But it&#x27;s not a long shaggy terry either.  I think that to make it look as fluffy as they did in the picture they must have taken a brush to a new strap and brushed the fabric against the grain to make it stand up as tall as possible.  Once it&#x27;s been wet it shrinks a little and tightens up and shortens that nap.  Making it feel smoother once dry.  Once it&#x27;s wet down again, it will likely feel a little bit rougher.&lt;br /&gt;With that, hope it helped some.  You&#x27;ll just have to make your decision about whether to order it or not. If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, you can return it so long as you do it within the time constraints that Amazon lays out.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband after reading the reviews.  He has a bit of a shoulder problem.  Because of the length of the scrubber, he was able to use it without aggravating his shoulder.  He really likes this product and would recommend it to others looking for a good substantial back scrubber.</li>
    <li> I tried this scrubber and I really like it. It is a heavy terry cloth and those scrubbing strips are great. They may NOT be for delicate skin but they are great for me. The handles keep the end of the scrubber flat and unbunched, the way a cord handle would. It is HEAVY, so no offense to the ladies, but this is a man&#x27;s scrubber.  It say&#x27;s this is extra long, but it is only five inches longer than the one I picked up at the local Walmart, and it works fine. The extra length makes it easier to use, and I am NOT tall.</li>
    <li> What I was looking for. Couldn&#x27;t seem to find a brush with a long enough handle to suit my husband. I think this might do the trick but since I haven&#x27;t given it to him to use yet, not sure. Product seems to be a good quality.</li>
    <li> I love it and wonder why I didn&#x27;t get one years ago.  Also works great for a do it yourself back scratcher</li>
    <li> I received it today&lt;br /&gt;I am more tan happy with this product&lt;br /&gt;it is long enough and rough enough to scrub my back</li>
    <li> This back scrubber works as advertised.  It can be used on most parts of the body. The extra length makes it easier to use than the short versions.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the scrubber. I wanted a longer one for the convenience of flipping directions when I&#x27;m scrubbing and also for comfort. A shorter scrubber cramps my shoulders. I was somewhat relunctant thinking the amount of nylon would not be enough to get the feeling of a good scrub but it turned out to be a perfect mix.</li>
    <li> I must say I loved the first review thanks for that! And I was a little scared to buy this because a few people said it was too rough and painful I have a pretty sensitive back but I went out on a limb because it looked machine washable and it is! I don&#x27;t like the idea of my. Back germs just chilling on my back scrubber so every once in a while I like to wash mine and it went well and as for how rough it is... well whoever said it was painful must have a back made out or tissue paper because this thing feels GREAT... I love it! Will update if it breaks or anything but as of now it has earned my 5 star approval!!</li>
    <li> Seems to have too much fabric.  Doesn&#x27;t soap up easily.  I find the &amp;#34;net&amp;#34; style with a handle much easier/handier to use.</li>
    <li> Works really well. I like the slightly abrasive (ex-foliating) properties. Since I have been using it my back itches less. Hope that it holds up for awhile and seems to be fairly well made.</li>
    <li> This product works well. It has what I feel is the perfect texture for scrubbing one&#x27;s back. Soft cloth with interspersed rough strips. The extra long size makes is both efficient and comfortaqble when using. Seems to be holding up well after several weeks of daily use. I bought another one for my 87 year old father who has flexibility issues and, because of the extra length, he&#x27;s able to easily use it on his back.</li>
    <li> Too long for an average size person otherwise it would be ok  so be sure to consider the length of it relative to your size</li>
    <li> Sucks. Used it maybe twice.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but not as good or useful as the one I&#x27;m trying to replace. It doesn&#x27;t hold soap as well as the terry and nylon one I&#x27;m trying to replace. It is also too rough.</li>
