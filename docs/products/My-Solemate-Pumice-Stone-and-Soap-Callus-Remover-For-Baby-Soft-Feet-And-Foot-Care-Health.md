<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!! It leaves my feet so smooth.... and it is so convenient to have the soap and pumice together!! Would definitely recommend it!!</li>
    <li> the soulemate is a great item-i&#x27;ll be using it often for good results.</li>
    <li> Very nice products , does a great job</li>
    <li> Really cool. I&#x27;m not one for doing my own feet, but this item is so easy, it&#x27;s hard not to become addicted to using it. Love the soap and the pumice stone is effective without ripping my feet to bits. Lovely product, would buy again.</li>
    <li> This by far is the best pumice stone foot file on the market!!  I was in Las Vegas for a week and wore sandals the whole time and the last thing I wanted were cracked and icky looking feet.  I took my solemate with me and after using one time I had the best looking feet, so soft and smooth.  I will be using this once a week now that&#x27;s it&#x27;s summer so my heels and feet keep on looking great.  So glad I found this product!!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the other raving reivews and it did not disappoint.  I used it tonight and my ugly foot caluses are gone.  Love the smell of the soap too.  The whole process only took 15 minutes.  I am a very satisfied customer!!!&lt;br /&gt;Diane</li>
    <li> Love this! My heel was perfect after the first use. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought this off a friend recommendation and I&#x27;m so happy I did. I&#x27;ve tried versions that scrape your feet, but they never seem to work and my heels stayed dry. I&#x27;ve been using My Solemate for a week now and my heels are so much smoother. It&#x27;s so nice to have the soap on one side to lather and flip right over to the pumice stone. Truly enjoying my Solemate.</li>
    <li> Not a bad foot scrubber...but I&#x27;ve used better!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough great things about this product! It is WONDERFUL! The soap smells lovely and the pumice stone is great quality! My feet were smooth and silky after just one use! I will be purchasing more for gifts for friends and family! Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed,  I&#x27;m tired of paying money to get my feet done,  this was perfect with the soap on one side and the pumice stone on the other.  Used it in the shower so easy.</li>
    <li> This will be my second time ordering this product! Love it! I don&#x27;t have too much time to devote to my feet and this is so quick and easy to use. Now I won&#x27;t have to relegate myself to the dim corner in yoga class for fear of traumatizing others with my yeti feet.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. The idea is really great and the stone and soap both work beautifully. It would be nice if the two halves clipped together a little more securely, as the pieces tend to separate when in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging could also use an update. I would love to give this to girlfriends as a gift, but the presentation when it arrived wasn&#x27;t especially attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is overall a really great product, and I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Lovely product.  The soapy side smells so nice and the pumice side does exactly what the product advertises. I am 100% satisfied and even promised my daughter in laws to get them one also . Highly reccomend</li>
    <li> This product is such a great invention!  My feet are always tired walking in heels or boots 7 days a week and I don&#x27;t have time to go and get a pedicure each week...well this product not only makes my feet happy it also saves me time and $$$!  Absolutely love it and recommend it for everyone to try and also would be great ad a holiday gift!  A Must try!!!</li>
    <li> Performed exactly as I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> Fantastic idea and a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This is a really unique idea! I started looking for a pumice stone and then ran across this. It&#x27;s really handy and helps with the slippery soap problem. I think I need to get one of these for my mom. Her feet are really bad haha - this product is high quality and works as advertised. It comes with a sheet of directions and information about the product. This is such a simple idea, yet very effective and more efficient.</li>
    <li> This product is a marriage saver. Sounds like an over-statement but it&#x27;s true. My husband doesn&#x27;t have feet. He has hooves. Rough, scratchy, gross feet. UNTIL My Solemate! I&#x27;m so elated to have found this product again!! No more scratchy feet in the bed 😃👍</li>
    <li> Great product! Makes a huge difference in the texture of my skin on the bottom of my feet. I am a stay at home mom of 3, but between keeping up with kids, doing chores, standing in the kitchen and just not having a lot of time to &amp;#34;pamper&amp;#34; myself, the bottoms of my feet were definitely something I wanted to hide. After just 2 uses, I can tell a big difference! I will be buying this again for sure!!</li>
    <li> My feet were looking a little rough so I ordered this and while I didn&#x27;t think the soap part was anything special the stone itself worked great! My heels look and feel so much better! I have small hands and I actually felt the soap attached made it harder for me to get a comfortable grip.</li>
    <li> Works just like should. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great shipper every thing looks good!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Received product exactly as described. Works great.</li>
    <li> I bought my soulmate for my daughter. She absolutely loves it. She has used it for three days and has already noticed a big improvement in her feet. She says it is the perfect size it fits in her hand perfectly. She has already asked me where did I buy it at, because she doesn&#x27;t ever want to run out of this product. She used a razor to shave her calluses off her heels and sometimes she would cut herself. Not anymore she is definitely reordering.. Thank you so much for buying this for me it is already working wonders.&lt;br /&gt;She said she was definitely going to tell her friends about &amp;#34;my soulmate&amp;#34;..</li>
    <li> I have tried to use a pumice for my feet on numerous occasion in the past and it has never worked. My feet still looked dry and needed work. The solemate made my feet look great after two days. I have been using it ever since to make sure my feet continue to look and feel healthy. This was a great order. If you really want to use a pumice for healthy feet, the solemate is what you should buy. There&#x27;s no way it won&#x27;t work as long as you follow the directions.</li>
    <li> I love this two-fer, soap and pumice stone! Makes exfoliating my feet so much faster and easier!</li>
    <li> Love love love!!! I bought for all the ladies in my life and they love too!! Great time of year for a pedi everyday!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> After trying many different heel removers, I saw this one on Amazon and all the positive reviews it had and decided to give this one a try.  Wow, is all I can say, it took my rough, cracked and very dry heels to smooth, soft and free of any issues!!  Your Solemate is amazing and so happy I found it! I&#x27;m a million times satisfied and highly recommended this product.</li>
    <li> Received it today package beautifully can&#x27;t wait to try it tonight.</li>
    <li> GREAT product!!! I just ordered my second one! Love it.....</li>
    <li> LOVE this product .. All yoga studios should sell it .. My feet are the prettiest in the class.  So smooth. Easy to use , will definitely purchase as gifts for my friends and family .</li>
    <li> So happy solemate is being shipped to Canada to fulfill my needs and dreams.. Love the product</li>
    <li> The soap was the best part as it does have a nice smell.  The stone wore down dramatically on the first use.  After I used it, it seemed to do nothing to help the dry skin on my heel.  Also, the company kept nagging me to submit a review and I had not even used the product yet.  I had to email them to stop contacting me.  Definitely not worth the money and I highly DO NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As a person who frequents the nail salon for foot care I have to say I love the Solemate. Lets be serious here, the real reason us ladies gets pedicures monthly isn&#x27;t all about the toe nails and polishing them its the dry cracked feet. I thought wow lets try this and compare the outcome. So here&#x27;s what happened, last month I had my normal pedicure at $45.99 a pop; yep my feet looked all pretty when I left but as each day went by I noticed that stubborn dry cracky heels returning ( mind you it had only been 3 days since my pedicure). During this time I was waiting for my order to arrive and when it did I made my escape to the bathroom to start my feet makeover. Can you say WOW, one treatment and I wasn&#x27;t ashamed to rub my feet on my hubby anymore. Its been 5 days so far and no cracky feet. Here&#x27;s the kicker, my hubby noticed the &amp;#34;hammer time&amp;#34; was gone from my feet and now he wants to try it, this coming from a man who works in construction on his feet 10-12 a daily in work boots. So I&#x27;m off to order another and will update later with that outcome. This time I am going to take before and after shots of his feet and if this works on his feet (I call his feet, Velcro feet) you&#x27;ll have a customer for life and maybe a new line of customer....Construction crews</li>
    <li> I am a new mom so I don&#x27;t have time for monthly pedicures anymore. This is the perfect solution for the &amp;#34;in between&amp;#34; times, until I can get to the nail salon. Plus, it is better than oily scrubs that are like a death-wish on your shower floor. (Just can&#x27;t wait for the soap refills to become available.)</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. Wish they made one with a handle so it would be easier to use. Soap very creamy &amp; pumice workwellto remove calluses .</li>
    <li> The pad does not appear to be real pumice stone, but rather a hard plastic surface which is rough.</li>
    <li> The Solemate works better than any other pumice I have ever used and I have used almost every foot care product on the market!  Love and will be a return customer.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a stocking stuffer for husband. He says it works on his callous filled feet.! I&#x27;m not dipping in and trying though, so you&#x27;ll need to take his word.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but won&#x27;t make any huge change as it said in the description.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing EVER!!!  I am nuts when it comes to my feet being dry...I HATE it!!  With that being said, I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of things on the market.  This is spot on....I feel like I just got a pedi!  The lemongrass scent it AMAZING too!  When it comes to all the products I&#x27;ve wasted money on, I&#x27;m glad I have FINALLY found a product I don&#x27;t mind spending money on.  You&#x27;ve gained a customer for life...now to get the other&#x27;s in my life with less than stellar feet on board!  (hmmmm....GREAT gift idea)  :)</li>
    <li> Best pumice stone on the market.  I have been using it for a week and there is a noticeable difference.  I threw out my other pumice stone and am stocking up on my solemates!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first but this product is fantastic!! my feet have never felt so smooth love it recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I love how easy this is to use. Now my wife won&#x27;t complain of me scratching her with my feet :-) Great product!!!!</li>
    <li> Hey finally something that works for me.It&#x27;s been two days, two days and I see the difference i will strongly recommend this product..... i love the soap.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!!!! Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Very handy to have and in a good format.  However, not recommended for diabetics, of which I am one, not sure why but passed it along to another person who loves it.</li>
    <li> I have never used any kind of pumice OR ever had a pedicure because I was afraid it would be too invasive or spread germs from instruments or hurt (lol) but my sister insisted I try this, and I LOVE IT! The soapy side is some kind of miracle soap that makes everything soft and when you hit it with the abrasive side - which is white and looks nothing like the scary volcanic pumice stuff- your foot just stops having 40 years of callus on it and is clean and soft and NICE!</li>
    <li> I purchased and used  my soulmate when it first came out several years ago and loved it then and love it now!  it is an amazing product and makes a great gift.  I used them for mani-pedi gift baskets I make for family and friends and everyone loves them! My Soulmate Rocks!!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of the &amp;#34;My Solemate&amp;#34; products around Mother&#x27;s day but WHOOPS they didn&#x27;t make it to Mom. Love this so much. It&#x27;s just so easy! I wear flip-flops all summer long so I scrub my feet down and get rid of the NYC dirt every night before bed - and smooth my feet in the process. It has made such a difference for me so far this summer.  My co-worker uses it too, and he&#x27;s a dude.</li>
    <li> It is really good with an excellent scrubbt side and a nice light scented soapy side. They come apart for easy handling. I gave the extra one as a gift and she loved it.</li>
    <li> This is a great, very effective pumice! I have used everything under the sun and in three uses of this my feet already feel 100x better. I don&#x27;t have calluses just dry skin and this is great at removing it not just smoothing it over. I like the idea of the soap with it, very moisturizing but I do separate them as it is easier to hold. This is a staple in my shower for everyday use. I&#x27;ll be purchasing the lemongrass one next! Thank you for such a great product that delivers... Finally!</li>
    <li> My Solemate looks great, feels great to use. Quality product all around, even the packaging. It&#x27;s very well made, and it is a unique and fascinating invention. The soap is of high quality, and the pumice is not real hard like most, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt or gouge your foot because it doesn&#x27;t have hard sharp edges. It works very well, and I find myself studying it every time I use it, because I am really that impressed and satisfied with it&#x27;s performance. With my dry cracked heels I need all the relief I can get, and My Solemate does the job. What an incredible product. It is so convenient to use...all in one hand. In just a short time there is already a huge noticeable difference in my heels. I&#x27;m feeling like this year my heels will finally be crack and pain free. No more referring to myself as &amp;#34;Gator Foot&amp;#34;...WooHoo! A huge Kudos to the creator of this product, which I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product and price.</li>
    <li> I got my Solemate today and used it right away. It really does work! I have a nagging callus for years on the side of my foot and just one use of this, it seemed my callus was gone!!! I was shocked how this little thing works like wonders. I will definitely buy more of these for my girlfriends and relatives.</li>
    <li> This is the MOST amazing product!  I love the scent of the soap and the ease of use.  My feet are so soft now and no rough skin! Very easy to use and every woman needs this!  Great gift for anyone :)</li>
    <li> I surprised relatives over the holidays by spicing up their gifts with this little extra and they absolutely loved it. This is something most anyone could use and most people don&#x27;t even know that it exists...and it&#x27;s not only purposeful, it&#x27;s inexpensive!</li>
    <li> My sole mate is amazing! I got one for everyone in my family for Mother&#x27;s Day! We all love it! Amazon is awesome but I wish it was at Target. My feet r so soft and I luv not having a bar of soap separate  from my pumice stone! Such an amazing invention!!</li>
    <li> Yummy lemon grass version..  while I showered scrubbed and lathered my dull dirty (I have no carpets and four dogs in my house and hate wearing slippers) so dirty feet are par the course for me.. Easy to use.. Glorious scent and soft clean fresh gleaming feet! It&#x27;s a must have, it&#x27;s that simple!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how much I LOVE LOVE LOVE this.  Every one should own one of these that has rough feet.  It works great.  I used this, then ordered a OKeefe Health feet foot crème and heel socks sold here on Amazon.  Amazing how wonderful all three together worked, but even after that, I use this whenever my feet feel a little rough.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a licensed pedicurist/manicurist for 16 years.&lt;br /&gt;I do my own pedicures because I can&#x27;t STAND for anyone to touch my feet.&lt;br /&gt;My feet are EXTREMELY sensitive &amp; it&#x27;s beyond being ticklish!! 😉&lt;br /&gt;  I can&#x27;t tell you how many pumice stones or foot files I&#x27;ve used over the years! A ridiculous variety!!&lt;br /&gt; Let me just tell you what a BRILLIANT product this is. A pumice stone on one side &amp; soap on the other?!?!&lt;br /&gt;SOLD!! I&#x27;m in LOVE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m for sure gonna spread the word on this gem!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product amazing I love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. It&#x27;s nothing special. Does the job.</li>
    <li> If you want smoother feet at home buy this.  The first one I had lasted over 1 year and saved me hundreds on pedicures.  I was getting a pedi once per month and now I go about quarterly.  This product is worth ever penny and I love it.  Just got my second one!</li>
    <li> It works pretty well.</li>
    <li> Hands down one of the best products to keep your feet nice smelling and smooth have ordered several and will continue to order!!</li>
    <li> They idea is great.  The soap is not for me, really drying and seems cheap. It seems to leave a film but not a film of moisture.   The pumice side falls apart very quickly and is just not a type I would prefer.  I made the mistake of taking the two sides apart (apparently the are replaceable which seems like a great idea) and I must not be able to lock it back because every time I use it they slip apart.</li>
    <li> I am a nurse and I spend over 12 hours on my feet...My Solemate is what my feet really needed. The soap leaves you feet very smooth and smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely loved it. Can&#x27;t wait to order the other scent (I currently have the lemongrass scent).</li>
    <li> Absolutely love &amp;#34;my solemate&amp;#34;!!!!! I am SOLD:)</li>
    <li> I bought some of these for Christmas gifts and everyone of my friends loved it.  It is not often you give gifts and hear great things about the items after it has been used.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I was on the fence about buying this, but I&#x27;ve only used it twice and already see a significant improvement. I would recommend &amp; buy again!</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week I&#x27;m noticing a huge difference in the condition of my feet.  Full disclaimer though...I do use this along with a Urea foot cream.  I can say though that the combo of this and the urea foot cream has been better than using the urea foot cream and amope pedi perfect.  What a waste of money that thing was.  The solemate at a fraction of the cost is far superior.  I just wish it had the ingredients listed.</li>
    <li> Great stone for rubbing on your feet.  Not too hard, not too soft, just right.  I like how it comes with soap on the other side making lubrication than cleaning a quick affair.  Can recommend.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about this product at all. I will stick to my Sally Hansen foot file I keep in my shower and a sponge exfoliater/soap scrub made for feet. This thing Is not made well for a slippery wet shower. Clearly regardless of what kind of scrub you use in the shower for your feet I realize you have to balance and lean into something with your other arm but with this thing it spins while you try to use it then it comes apart which doesn&#x27;t make any sense because that&#x27;s the reason I bought this because it&#x27;s 2 in 1.</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect with this product and was pleasantly surprised. I used it the first time yesterday in the shower and I can&#x27;t believe how much dead skin it removed from my foot. I applied lotion to my foot after and I was really happy with the results. The pumice left my foot soft with no dry skin on it, and this is just from one use. I have really dry feet and have tried tons of lotions, creams and foot pumices to alleviate this issue. This worked out great, I can now wear cute sandals without worrying about my ugly dry feet. I&#x27;m going to buy another one and one for my mother.</li>
    <li> Seems to wear a little quick, but for the price it is great!</li>
    <li> My daughter is thrilled to have this wonderful smelling pedicure pumice stone and soap!</li>
    <li> Worn out on the first time using it</li>
    <li> This is my first time to try it and I&#x27;m glad that its pumice stone is not as rough or harsh on the skin compared to other products. This is great for people who have sensitive skin. Aside from that, I like that this product wasn&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s simple to use. Makes my feet look great. Love this product.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  I love the new lemongrass scent!  So fresh!  Best product, especially this time of year!   This is a great product and so glad I have it!  I have poorer circulation in my left leg resulting in dry, cracked feet that drive me crazy.  Only a few days of using my solemate and I&#x27;ve got smoother feet than I generally do after a pedicure, which I get as regularly as I can!  I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone.  I am looking forward to giving these as gifts/stocking stuffers.  Great, great, great product!</li>
    <li> Received my Solemate last week and wanted to give it some time to see how it worked on my feet.  WOW!  I love this product and so do my feet!  Love the fragrance too!</li>
    <li> This is the best thing ever made. My feet have always been dry and prone to cracks. This week (I just started using this on Tuesday) my feet are so soft! I really can&#x27;t believe how well this works! I am in love!</li>
    <li> This product delivers. My feet are very smooth. I highly recommend this product. :)</li>
    <li> Worked great in the shower and my heels are smooth! The only reason why I gave this a 4 is because I do not know how long the pumice or moisturizing bar will last. I felt like I used more than expecting with only one use.</li>
    <li> Part of my shower gear for the gym. Small and compact so I can use it an run. My feet Thank You! and they&#x27;ll be foot fit for the beautiful weather so I can show them off!!</li>
    <li> Pleasantly suprised at how will this works. Took care of light calluses around my heels in about a week</li>
    <li> So.... goodbye (and good riddens) to my calluses!  This stone/soap is AMAZING!!!!</li>
    <li> My Solemate, Great product to use between pedicures. Love the new fragrance lemongrass scent.</li>
    <li> I must say the pumice takes off the dead skin off but it stays on it and even when you soak it it doesn&#x27;t matter. The sop part of the solemate sucks. It does lather the foot but it&#x27;s like a thick cream that needs to be rubbed off after your done.</li>
    <li> Works well on dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love My Solemate! I got this as a gift from a girlfriend. I use it every day in the shower and my feet are so incredibly smooth and soft. I love how the soap is creamy and velvety and smells amazing! The pumice is not too abrasive and has lasted such a long time. I have had it for weeks and it seems it will last many more! All around great product! I would highly recommend this to anyone. I will be purchasing several soon to put in gift bags I am making for a gals weekend beach reunion!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super hard to use because of the soap bar on top</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It works so well and is a lifesaver in between pedicures. It also lasts a surprisingly long time. I am thrilled it&#x27;s back on the market.</li>
    <li> Best product for such a low price. Your feet will thank you</li>
    <li> Best pumice stone on the market today. Stocking stuffers for my entire family! (And I&#x27;m keeping a few for myself!)</li>
    <li> As a beauty editor, I have WAY too many things in my shower. This one has become a permanent fixture. It saves time and saves my feet! I don&#x27;t have to scare my fiance with my rough feet in bed anymore!</li>
    <li> Really easy pumice stone and moisturizing bar. The 2 bars connect and you can lay the pumice stone flat down so the soap doesn&#x27;t get gooey. Great for getting off rough skin and softening.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best pumice stone ever!! My feet have never felt so fabulous. I plan on buying more as gifts for my friends!</li>
    <li> What a great product!!  I suffer from migraines so it is difficult for me to use products with a scent because the smell can trigger the headache. I live in Florida and wear flip flops all year so having nice feet is a concern. Who has money for pedis every week. I bought the My Solemate hoping it would save me time and money but what I got was way beyond that! I cautiously opened the package and the most delicious, soft fragrance came drifting out. The scent is so soft and wonderful that I just sat there taking it in. No headache, just a relaxing feeling. I just had to use it. Let me tell you, the scent filled my shower and as the pumice stone rubbed my feet to perfection. I am in love with this set! A wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> It actually works. If you use it right.</li>
    <li> Ehh, got this because of the great reviews but it&#x27;s not THAT great, I don&#x27;t have nasty feet I pumice daily and thought this would be an easier way to do that but after one use the pumice is pretty much gone, the water dissolves it, and no I wasn&#x27;t in the shower or let it soak in the tub. It does smooth your feet but for 13 bucks save yourself the money and get one that will last longer than one use.</li>
    <li> My Solemate an awesome genius product!  My wife loves it and wonders why it wasn&#x27;t invented years ago!  It easy to use and so convenient!  Got one for my sister in law and my two daughters in law!</li>
    <li> I am a true, long time fan of this brilliant product and I was THRILLED when I realized that I could finally purchase My Solemate on Amazon!! Maintaining a pedi between visits to the nail salon was always a drag until I started using My Solemate....now I get in the chair with my feet feeling as smooth as the last time I got out of it! Highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Having groomed feet is a pet peeve of mine.  I was so excited when my Solemate arrived.  You have to get one of these, trust me you will not be disappointed.  This is the perfect unusual gift for the holidays both unusual and practical.  The soap included leaves your skin feeling soft and clean. The stone side has a great grind for getting those rough areas of your feet.</li>
    <li> I loved my first one so much, I grabbed a lemongrass. OHMYGOD. The lemon is amazing. It&#x27;s so citrus-y and feels fantastic.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the Solemate. It&#x27;s so cool the way you&#x27;ve put both items together. I used it over the weekend and I was really happy with it. It&#x27;s just the perfect combo and I know I&#x27;ll reorder again when they&#x27;ve been used up. You did a GREAT job of putting the two together, great idea and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells great!</li>
    <li> The convenience of an all-in-one soap and pumice is ingenius!  After lathering, the pumice is right there, no unsafe balance act required to put the soap down and grab your pumice. And the pumice itself is very high-quality, and the perfect coarseness.  Gentle enough to work on the more tender areas of my foot, but coarse enough for the heel.  Very pleased with its performance - excited to finally have a product that really works on these calluses. Superb!</li>
    <li> To hard for callus!!! I didn&#x27;t like it at all!!! I have had better ones before!</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE this product!!! I felt a significant difference after the first try...</li>
    <li> Solemate is a must have for any bath hygiene routine.  Excellent product!!</li>
    <li> The box wasn&#x27;t damaged but the item was cracked. I used it anyway but it wasn&#x27;t any better than others I have tried.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve needed to not only moisturize but smooth my feet and particularly my heels. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different pumice stones and none of them do the trick like the Solemate.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best pumice stone ever. The combination of the soap and pumice stone is extremely fast and convenient to use in the shower. This is the perfect product to use in between pedicures. My feet are soft and smooth. I will definitely be stocking up on these gems :) Oh and an added plus was the extremely fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> The soap was nice, but there was no pumice stone. It&#x27;s just a cut piece of Styrofoam. I have since detached the &amp;#34;Pumice stone&amp;#34; and am using it to hold pins for crafting.</li>
    <li> Works great on the rough spots on my feet!  Will buy again</li>
    <li> So far Hands down the Best Pumice stone I have ever used &amp; I have tried to many to count.&lt;br /&gt;Fast,easy to use &amp;Very efficient.&lt;br /&gt;1 Happy consumer.  :)</li>
    <li> L❤️VE! Bought soooo many for gifts!</li>
    <li> This is a great 1-2 punch. The bar soap on top is a nice addition too. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely splendid product! Good quality soap and a fabulous pumice stone all in one great product. I spend a ton of time on my feet and this product is indispensable for removing callouses, exfoliating and soothing tired feet!</li>
    <li> I hate that this was advertised to give you soft feet. I don&#x27;t even have rough feet compared to most people and I found this thing useless...It&#x27;s good for cleaning/scrubbing the bottom of your feet great in the shower, but if you want soft feet, go for a real pumice stone and some nice body butter or foot cream. This is more of a foam board that crumbles as you use it. The soap is nice but it is overpriced for no reason at all.</li>
    <li> Really nice product. Best pumice stone I&#x27;ve ever had. Soap is moisturizing. Pumice and soap come apart and be used separately or joined together. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I was very lucky I got introduced to the inventor of this genius product, Lori. She gifted me a My Solemate. And all I can say is: I LOVE IT! I did not expect this to be such an amazing product. And by that I mean: living in LA for over a decade I have had countless pedicures at the most amazing places. But I do not think my feet have ever felt this beyond silky smooth for so long like they do after using My Solemate. This is a genius product. Cannot be compared to any other similar gadget. And My Solemate even beats the fanciest spa treatment I have ever received. Get it. You will not regret it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the worst dry, peeling, cracking feet for the longest time, they were gross to look at, my feet looked like zombie feet....  I&#x27;ve spent so much money on lotions and creams and other exfoliaters and nothing works as good as this. My boyfriend gives me foot rubs all the time now, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping and good communication from seller.</li>
    <li> My Solemate is amazing. I gave them as stocking stuffers a few Christmases back and now those people are huge fans too. It&#x27;s perfect for the shower and the pumice stone on it is so good -- my very hard and not-always-so-hot New York feet look and feel so much better after I&#x27;ve used this. This product was on the market a few years ago and I was devastated when it went away (think they just ran out of inventory). I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s back! And just in time for the holidays!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my soulmate!  I&#x27;ve bought this product when it first came out and love it so much I had to purchase more. My friends and family still thank me to this day for giving them  a soulmate as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. My feet never looked and felt so good.  My pedicure lady even asked me what have I been using because my feet were so much smoother and callouses were gone. I am so happy with this product and will forever have it in my life. Thank you for coming up with this Fabulous idea and for a product that really fulfills its purpose.</li>
    <li> The solemate made bath time so much fun, making it the perfect gift for both my kids (age 6 and 8) and mommy, too!!!  As my girls gained independence, they wanted to wash themselves, but they couldn&#x27;t do it properly, due to difficulty holding the slippery soap.  The solemate allowed them this ability, making shower time more efficient and fun for everyone!  It was also recommended by our pediatrician that they use a pumice stone on their feet because of callouses, warts, blisters, etc... and this was a perfect solution to this too. All that my girls want now is a different color for each one of them.</li>
    <li> Im a very active woman and my feet know it. The sole mate is very helpful because it allows me to have my own home pedicure every few days. It&#x27;s very easy to use, the soap smells delicious and the pumice isn&#x27;t too rough on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product without hesitation plus it&#x27;s a great holiday gift.</li>
    <li> We all let our feet go in the winter. Boots and wool socks hide those scaly, callous covered horrors. I hate pumice stones because they don&#x27;t really do any good and the &amp;#34;egg&amp;#34; scrapers take forever and hurt. This item is genius. Luxurious bath bar and a pumice that gets the job done! I have one in the shower and a spare tucked away.  Summer is practically here! Are you sandal ready?</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Did not care of it - not impressed.  Have other pedicure tools that work much better.</li>
    <li> My Soulmate has become an integral part of my morning routine. Love it!! Keeps my feet so soft.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really feels like getting a foot massage! The pumice stone has a very nice texture and it felt wonderful on my tired feet. It was also very easy to apply and I was able to quickly tend to both of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the very first use I noticed a remarkable difference with my skin. It is noticeably smoother!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be a great stocking stuffer or perfect for getting ready for sandal season. Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> This is the one I&#x27;m sticking with after trying multiple devices including those electric roller devices. I don&#x27;t use the soap side of this but the scrubbing side is really good. You do want to use this with some soap and with your feet moistened in order to provide a surface that the scrub pad can move over and where you can apply pressure. Overall this is great.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for anyone needing a all in one foot pumice and soap. It&#x27;s not only genius it smells good and easy to use.  My young girls love using it too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m guilty of it, I have judged people by the shape of their tootsies. There are few things as off putting as chipped polish, dry cracked feet or toe callouses. I mean, I just threw up in my mouth a little bit typing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stay on top of it. I go get a mani-pedi 2x a month but I honesty hate having my feet touched. I also hate that weird cheese grater/knife contraption that my pedicurist asks &amp;#34;Callous removal?&amp;#34; It&#x27;s an extra $5 on top off it. I&#x27;m lucky because now I can reply &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t need it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with every single problem in life, prevention is key. You&#x27;re in the shower everyday anyhow so why not take care of your footsies with my solemate? I use my lemongrass one everyday and &amp;#34;Chief Stinkfoot&amp;#34; has left the building. Picture a bar of soap backed by a handy piece of plastic. That&#x27;s the first part. The second part is a pumice that snaps onto the other side. So it&#x27;s a dual tool that gently exfoliates off dead skin. It gets rid of callouses and cracks and it prevents new ones from appearing. Once I&#x27;m all pumiced I then lather up with the refreshing lemongrass scented soap. Easy as 1-2-3  and I&#x27;m in no fear of impromptu walks on the beach! Grab one, they last forever and your tootsies will thank you~!</li>
    <li> this is the best invention since white bread! All in one soap and pumice stone! Genius! Thank you Forguy for sharing! Guess what all my lady friends are getting for stocking stuffers. Good-bye callouses! Hello softness,</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I bought the silk blossom last week and have used it several times. I have awesome feet already, but with summertime here who couldn&#x27;t use even sexier feet for those summer sandals. Since they are on sale today, I ordered two more, one more Silk Blossom and I am going to try the Lemon Grass as well. The Silk Blossom smells really great. I am a Mom and this was a gift to myself for helping my daughter get through another school year with perfect grades!</li>
    <li> My Solemate is awesome. This is our second one, and it become part of my daily routine. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have really bad calluses and cannot even count how much $$$ I have spent over the  years to soften my feet. This product is amazing, well priced and effective immediately. You can see and FEEL the results after your first use. My only complaint would be you have to buy two if you have a daughter because my daughter grabbed My Solemate and is refusing to give it back :) Great price, great results. What else could your feet want?</li>
    <li> Softer feet after the first use.  Love this!</li>
    <li> This thing is magical. It really does help get rod of dead/dirty/hard foot skin.  Yuck lol</li>
    <li> Will always have one. I live in NYC but I still one to where sandals a lot. My apartment has a floor that attracts dust no matter how often I wash the floors. It is very convenient to use this in the shower everyday, soap and then pumice, nice!</li>
    <li> Great product!!!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I totally dig this product.  It definitely makes my feet softer.  Great stuff and worth the price.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve often thought that this product should be invented and now it has. Easy to use, and does the job well! Prompt shipping...Packaged well. You can&#x27;t ask for more!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The concept is really neat! I like having the soap and pumice together! Although you can separate them as well. The soap is a little perfumey for my personal taste.</li>
    <li> I am hooked on My Solemate. It is a miracle, my feet were always dry and cracked. Every since I started using the solemate my feet are as soft as my 1 year old daughter&#x27;s feet. I would recommend this to every one.</li>
    <li> My husband was complaining about calluses on his feet.  He&#x27;s tried a lot of products and nothing has really worked.  Saw this while browsing Amazon, read the reviews and watched the video, and figured, for $12.99, it was worth a try.  Short version:  he loved it.  The calluses that were bothering him have been smoothed away and his feet look and feel much much better.</li>
    <li> Works after 1st try! It didn&#x27;t break apart either so I know I&#x27;ll get many uses out of it.</li>
    <li> I liked the product but it didn&#x27;t remove my callous.</li>
    <li> This really is my solemate!!!!  I love love this product. I&#x27;m so happy I found it!  It&#x27;s so easy and convienient. As a mom of two toddlers I never make time for myself. With my solemate I can quickly get my feet to have a smooth finish after all the running around I do chasing my little ones!</li>
    <li> It seems as though my feet are always cracked.  I added My Solemate to my shower routine and saw tremendous improvement.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Love this! After just a few weeks of occasional use my heels and feet are so soft!</li>
    <li> I have been using my Solemate Pumice Stone for a week now and I LOVE it.... the dual action, soap on one side and the pumice stone on the other is just a great idea. My feet are super smooth, so happy with this product!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my order and tried my new Soulmate immediately. I love, love, love it. My feet are so smooth.</li>
    <li> Dry cracked feet are the bane of my existence! Living in the Nevada desert climate, foot care.. Skin care in general is critical. It is far too easy to deplete your skin of hydration and end up having dry and cracked skin (especially on my feet). This is absolutely the best solution I&#x27;ve ever seen in one great package. There is no need to honestly shop any further. If you are looking to soften and moisturize your skin, the My Soulmate pumice stone and moisturizing soap combination is the way to go. I received this product at a discount for the purposes of an honest and unbiased review. These are my opinions!</li>
    <li> Works well. Delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews but I am going to I bought this while browsing for the pedicure kit and I must say I love it, its very simple &amp; easy to use it leaves your feet soft and smooth I will give it a 4 stars. Yes I recommend it</li>
    <li> Love my SoleMate, my feet feel so nice &amp; smooth after several weeks of use.</li>
    <li> The top portion kept on rotating and dislodging - Didin&#x27;t work - Sent Back</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE pumice side of the solemate, but am not crazy about having the soap side attached with it. I think it would be a better product, if they were sold separately. The soap itself is ok, but it gets very mushy, slippery and is not comfortable have holding it in your hand, while using the pumice side. Please sell just the pumice stone separately.  I will be a loyal customer forever if you do. This is why I only gave you three stars. If you sell them separately you will get 5 stars from me. I believe this is a gimmick to sell your soap which is not really needed.</li>
    <li> Thanks to my solemate I love my feet again!! It seems a natural part of aging is dry callused feet.  I have tried countless other pumice stones, foot files &amp; electric foot files.  As a mom of 3 I have very little time to care for myself and I had basically given up hope of having nice feet again.  Then I saw a friend comment about my solemate so I ordered one and gave it a try.  My feet have not been this happy in years! I use it every other time I shower.  It only takes a minute or so extra.  The soap side smells AMAZING!! The pumice stone is a creat texture unlike any I&#x27;ve ever used.  The combination of the two work incredible! Following my shower I put coco butter lotion on my feet and cover with socks... When I wake in the morning my feet are renewed like they were in my teen years.  I 100% recommend this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!!!  I use mine all of the time, to keep my feet looking great!  Gave these as holiday gifts to friends and family (guys &amp; girls)!  No one wants crusty feet, right?</li>
    <li> Being a heavier person, my feet work harder than the average persons, so I am always looking for a good product to use, I received My Solemate as a gift and can honestly say it is an amazing product it leaves my feet feeling very soft and silky, in addition really helps to remove my callouses, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT and would recommend it to everyone!!</li>
    <li> I initially purchased it for myself, being constantly on my feet walking  dogs all day my heels were a hot mess they were cracked, sore and for the life of me I could not get them clean after just one use my feet looked like they belonged on a person and not bigfoot and I actually put a pair of flip flops on that being said I thought to myself why couldn&#x27;t my Husband use this in his dry cracked damaged hands we tried everything but nothing worked so I had him try it IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE THEY LOOKED AMAZING after just one time but I didn&#x27;t take a before pic to show the difference but  we will be taking the solemate 7 day challenge I will post a pic of my husbands hands tomorrow after working on boilers and in oil  all day and in 7 days I will post the end result ( the after pic) if it goes the way I think it will I will finally be able to have my back scratched without getting cut!! LOL wish us luck</li>
    <li> I have used so many items for my dry cracked heels and this product is hands down the best I have used for a daily scrubber. It keeps my feet soft and cleans them perfectly. I will definitely order this one again. I had my doubts but I took the chance on it and I am sooo glad I did! This is going to be my stocking stuffer at Christmas for all the ladies on my list!</li>
    <li> I bought 3 different Callus remover.  My Soultmate, Emjoi Micro-pedi Battery Operated Callus Remover (1 Extra Roller Included) and the Silk Feet which is like a Silk Screen.  So far, definitely the best one is the Silk Feet which I went and gave it the highest review.  I was actually looking for the stone like the Soulmate because the one I have is about to retire.  I found it here in Amazon.  But I decided to order 3 different ones to see which one would perform the best.  I highly recommend the Silk Feet. as it  is the best one and unbelievably removed my bad calluses.  You have to be careful not to over do it tho because it is corrosive.  What I also like is I can bend it to a U-Shape and can go in areas that is hard to reach like in between my toes.  I went and purchased 3 more of Silk Feet.  It definitely works.. I will be returning Emjoi Micro-pedi battery operated one. I LOVE SILK FEET.  What an Excellent product!!!</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m a dude, but my feet were all jacked up.  I was looking for something that could deal with my dry crusty heels.  I ordered this based on the reviews, and when it arrived at my office, the soap was so fragrant that it made the whole room smell like a squeaky clean baby that&#x27;d been bathed in flowers.  Whatever.  I got it home and a couple of quick buffs on my heel and arches, and the flaking skin totally went away.  It&#x27;s smooth, but not rough, like it was that one time when my 16 year old niece made me get a pedicure and they took a microplane cheese grater to my foot--they shaved off a little too much--and plus that, my foot is not made of parmesan cheese, you know?  Anyway.  Buy this thing and use it on your feet.  It is awesome.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to other customers! It&#x27;s a great holiday gift for the ladies in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product for my wife and she absolutely loves it so much so that I had to buy more for my mother-in-law and mother after she raved about it to them. There&#x27;s nothing better than a product that does what it says it will do and provides a solution to a problem: Two products that are typically used in concert with one-another now in one convenient, common place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a great idea and at such a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> second time I have done this and hope this does go through, Very great product and got it for a stocking stuffer, Works great and as advertised,  Thank you</li>
    <li> Ever since I saw the postings in FB and people trying this product, I wanted to give it a try as well. Being an avid and very social salsa dancer, I have to make sure that I take care of my feet. My soulmate arrived yesterday and I decided to use it this morning....OMG I wished I had stayed in the shower longer!!! This handheld foot miracle is setting a standard for an &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; foot spa....which I recommend for all dancers as well as those who are on their feet at extensive hrs daily. I would like to end this review by saying: Thank you for this little foot heaven!&amp;#34; I will definitely buy this as gifts for my mom and husband.</li>
    <li> I am telling everyone about this! I am definitely buying again!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase on this item. My granddaughter is 5 years old. She has cracked heals.  She saw me using mine and wanted to try to&lt;br /&gt;see if it hurt. She was so excited that it worked and didn&#x27;t hurt. So I told her I would buy one just for her. She loves it.  Great for all ages. I love mine as well. I have spent so much money on items to help with my cracked heals, nothing worked. I can say I am going to be a lifetime user of this&lt;br /&gt;product. It is amazing.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a pumice stone, so I don&#x27;t have anything to really compare it to.  But it did exactly what it was supposed to!</li>
    <li> The only reason why I purchased it is because of the great review BUT its not that great. The soap is such a waste, doesnt really do anything, you better off with s regular stone.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what they use as for the gritty surface that exfoliates, but it is excellent.  It works perfectly to get dead skin off your feet.  The added benefit is that I used it to grind off the callouses on my palm ( under the fingers) to get rid of \\&quot;golf wounds\\&quot;- the thick skin on your hands from playing golf !  What an added benefit!  Would definitely buy again.  The soap is a nice feature to lather up and soften the skin too.</li>
    <li> I bought these for all of my daughters &amp; daughter in laws for Christmas!  Great product!  Easy to use, does a great job of keeping heels smooth between pedicures!  Highly recommend them!!</li>
    <li> This was ok. But it didn&#x27;t last long for cost</li>
    <li> This works better than any pumice stone I have ever used before.  It is gentle, yet it gets the job done quickly and very well.  I love the convenience of having the soap attached which makes it easier to use.</li>
