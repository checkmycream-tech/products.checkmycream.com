<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was very pleased with this product. I will be ordering again, it worked so good on a rash my dad had.</li>
    <li> this ointment is excellent for wrinkles, i&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now and its doing a great job.  just use before bed.</li>
    <li> I have been using E ointment as a face moisturizer before I put on my makeup for 20 years. I am in my 40&#x27;s and people cannot believe it when they find out my age. I dont have any wrinkles, spots or blemishes on my face and everyone thinks am 10 years younger then my age.  At my house it is also used for scraps, cuts, dry patches, chapped skin and razor bumps. I love this product...I am so happy I found it on Amazon because I cannot find it in stores anywhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and was thrilled to find it on Amazon since  am no longer able to purchase from a local retailer.  My children call it the \\&quot;good stuff.\\&quot;  We use it for chapped lips, scrapes, cuts, burns, hangnails, etc.  It works great for all sorts of things and does not sting (a plus for my son since he&#x27;s probably the most frequent recipient of a &#x27;glob&#x27;).</li>
    <li> Love this ointment. I use this under my eyes and on my wrinkles! It&#x27;s a great addition to my daily skincare routine. This is very thick and smells nice. The price was great and came very quickly!</li>
    <li> Luv it!! I will buy again :)</li>
    <li> I had been noticing little white spots on my toenails over the last few months, I figured I had bruised the nail or something.  Yesterday, I removed my polish to find that each of my big toes were 1/2  white,  I did research and found that it was a type of fungus.  Fungus!!!!  I read various cures, medications....one was to use Vicks vaporub......I couldn&#x27;t find mine.  As I was getting ready to leave the house, I noticed the e ointment in my vanity.....I decided to put it on my toenails.  Strange, my husband thought I was kidding.&lt;br /&gt;Within one hour, I noticed a huge difference.  One toe is entirely clear, the other has a tiny white spot.  The e ointment smells much better than Vicks, I couldn&#x27;t imagine going around day after day smelling like Vicks.....ha.  You just never know.  I intend to use this ointment more often.</li>
    <li> I use this in the winter months inside my nostrils(just a dab) to keep the ole nostrils from drying out ....a bottle last a long time!  And the ointment last all day !</li>
    <li> My mom actually is using this. She asked me to order again but it&#x27;s out of stock now. She said it is not only a good moisturizer but also good for her aching muscles as well. Hope Amazon will have it soon.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for about ten years. I used to purchase it at local drug stores, but couldn&#x27;t find it lately so went to Amazon. This is a great ointment for dry, flaky skin  and sun damage; it seems to replenish natural skin oils and moisture. As an Arizona carpenter I recommend it for anyone who spends extended time outdoors.</li>
    <li> Preferred Mart handled this order and did a great job.  Items were well packaged and delivered in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this ointment - great stuff.  Works great for people with excessively dry, red, irritated skin - especially during the winter months.</li>
    <li> i used this product extensively on my elbows and knees and other patches of dry skins - it smells soothing and feels good aginst my skin</li>
    <li> I have what amounts to a 3rd degree burn covering my&lt;br /&gt;right ankle and the front of my foot and I have tried&lt;br /&gt;so many products in order to keep this from itching&lt;br /&gt;into a semi bloody mess. I have applied this product&lt;br /&gt;along with some other skin repair paste, and have to&lt;br /&gt;admit the itching has subsided almost to nil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the almost clove like odor that emits from the jar.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive, but if it can help with this cooked flesh&lt;br /&gt;and help relieve the itching and pain...I&#x27;ll spring for it.</li>
    <li> use this product all the time</li>
    <li> I had hoped for better results against my exzema.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a number of years, works well to help reduce splits on hands and dry skin patches</li>
    <li> Very helpful for the body instead lotion, absurd in the body then you feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the relief of irritation due to psoriasis. The only reason I gave this product 4 instead of 5 stars is the size. I wish the jar was bigger. It is quite small</li>
    <li> Excellent ointment...I first bought this a year ago and it has been the only ointment that makes a difference in rough skin.</li>
    <li> Ive just purchased 3 more bottles. One for home and two for work....I swear by this product! Have been using this for years. In the Dental office on patients lips, before and after precedures. After one use people will contact us and ask how thay can find this product. At home it helps heal lips and skin irrittions. Actually made a scar on my sons hand totally invisable! Yep, we are big fans. Give it a whirl! Smile Much, DDS Helper</li>
    <li> I have always loved this ointment!  My mother gave me my first jar in the 90s after a traumatic facial injury, my face healed very nicely.  I finally ran out a few years ago, a little goes a long way, and was so excited to find it on Amazon!  I have a few burns that have healed and now is the time to use this ointment to help smooth the scar.  This ointment smells a little like cloves (which I love) and goes in fairly quickly.  Like I said before, a little ones a long way.</li>
    <li> Went to the beach a lot this summer.   But used the vitamin E Ointment and had no blistering or peeling.    Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product years ago when I had surgery to apply to the scars from the incisions. It helped healed them and made them almost invisible. I can no longer find it in the store and found it online. I now purchased it to use on my dogs nose. My vet informed me a little vitamin e to the nose helps soften it. As they get older some dog&#x27;s noses get hard and crusty and almost look like they are lifting at the edges. Just after two light applications I could see the difference immediately. It healed his nose and it looks normal again.</li>
    <li> I have used Vitamin E Ointment for several years now.  I use it at night on my face and either I&#x27;m incredibly lucky with good skin tone and type, or it is due to this stuff.  I am 53 and most people (that don&#x27;t know me) are shocked when they find out how old I actually am.  My drug store no longer carries it so I have to order it on-line.  It always arrives within a few days with no problems, (so far).&lt;br /&gt;I would (and have) recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Good product, I use the ointment on areas needing extra care and so far I like it. It does not say if you can put it on your lips, so if anyone knows, please let me know. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this product during the winter months. It&#x27;s a lifesaver though. I paid 6 dollars for it at GNC but you can find it cheaper here and other places. Just search. The ointment smells sweet, like cloves and is very thick and moisturizing. I&#x27;ve found that a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s really gotten rid of my flaky dry skin and some of the hyper pigmentation on my forehead.</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff.  Thank you</li>
    <li> a medicine cabinet must. I use it for chapped lips, rough elbows to scrapes and burns. This little bottle leasted my 8yrs and when I ran out I was unable to find it in my local stores. I was happy to find it was still available and found it on the internet</li>
    <li> I use it on both my lips and my children&#x27;s lips when they become dry or chapped. It&#x27;s also great for sore noses when the kids get a cold.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for at night before bed.  If you have dry spots, grab this up...  Try it , and see.... Cathi</li>
    <li> I use this cream to treat small and big cuts to reduce scarring, as a once a week facial cream to prevent acne scars and dry spots, and it is one of the best diaper rash ointments around! All in all a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I found this on Amazon.com, as I have purchased it before from other retailers online, but I like free shipping.</li>
    <li> We have loved this stuff for years. It used to be sold at Walgreen&#x27;s. Maybe you can find it at a local health food store. This was the best way to get it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I couldn&#x27;t find it when I looked for it.  Am so happy.</li>
    <li> This product is sooo good we keep reordering. It has many uses. Great on chapped lips, sore muscles, and dry patches.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this to me years ago for scars. I use it for my lips, under my eyes, on my cuticles or anyplace else that needs moisture or is irritated.  My cousin is going through chemotherapy and has had very dry chapped lips that have sores. I always keep a little travel size container with me.  He put this on his lips and felt immediate relief. I told him to keep the container and by day 3 his lips were almost completely healed. I ordered him his own container and had it shipped to his house. I have been using this for over 15 years. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product..been using for years.</li>
    <li> We have always used this product for minor burns and other skin ailments, scar reduction in particular.  When we could not find it at the local stores, we found it on Amazon and were very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have tried sooooo many creams, lotions and gels (including numerous prescriptions).  This product has, without a doubt, provided the most relief (albeit, not 100%).  Thank you for a wonderful product.  It is so wonderful to walk without the stabbing pain.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that my family and I have used for years.  It&#x27;s great especially for keeping chapped lips soft.</li>
    <li> Great product...helped the dry rash on the top of my foot when nothing else did.  I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> use this at night under eyes FANTASTIC.  A lot cheaper than my day cream, Le Mer.  Also apply it to my neck and chest.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product for spots where I have exceptionally dry skin.  Since then, I have found lots of different uses for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After buying this product, I was diagnosed as diabetic and placed on an insulin pump.  The pump sits on my skin for extended periods of time and causes skin irritation.  This product does an AMAZING job of alleviating the irritation, quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from use with insulin pumps, this ointment is great on dry skin patches, burns, and pretty much any other condition I&#x27;ve needed a topical ointment for.  It&#x27;s honestly better than other topical ointments that I&#x27;ve tried, including the usual over-the counter products (Neosporin, Triple Antibiotic Ointment, First Aid Cream, etc...).  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years! It heals scrapes and scratches quicker than anything else I have ever used. It is wonderful for dry skin and even better for dry brittle fingernails. My only complaint is I think it smells like cloves which have always made me sick but I deal with it because of how well it works. I wish I could give it many more stars. I have been buying it for YEARS and it&#x27;s always been $5. Now all of a sudden, I can only find it online and between it and shipping,it&#x27;s $10. That&#x27;s a disappointment but I have never found a product that works better so I will just have to pay the price.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best for dry skin-runners-massage everything.  Love it and so hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Helps keep my skin ultra moisturized i n the winter!!! i have eczema psoriasis and also struggling with tinea versicolor&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Not only does this work great for many things but it smells REALLY good.  Sort of spicy.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have super dry skin and use this product on my lips and face.  I have also put it on friends of mine with sun burns and their skin immediately felt better</li>
    <li> Hopefully I canceled this order in time.  I went to the GNC website and the label actually indicates that it is tocopherol acetate, not the pure stuff as it states here!  False advertising.</li>
    <li> The label says this is for &amp;#34;dry skin,wrinkles and stretch marks&amp;#34;,. however my wife and I (age 72 &amp; 75) use it for sore, arthritic joints.  It is absolutely amazing.My worst joints are in the knuckles of the toes and hands while my wife&#x27;s are pretty much all over.  Neither of us can sleep for the discomfort unless we rub the joints before bed time. I also rub it on the toe joints if I know I&#x27;ll be on my feet for a long period of time; yard work, volunteer work at local non profit and etc. We usually purchase at a local store in the Mall however, they stopped carrying the product.  I panicked until I found the product on Amazon.  Purchased 7 bottles so the panic is over for now.  A little goes a long way. It is a &amp;#34;God sent&amp;#34;. Bob &amp; Judy Smith</li>
    <li> I have been using vitamin e ointment on my face for about 30 years and I&#x60;m 74 and have no crows feet and only have lines around my mouth and my skin is very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a moisturizer for my dogs nose. It worked very well, had a perfect consistency, was easy to apply and lasted a long time once applied. I would recommend this product and seller to others</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  I love the aroma and it really seems to help with dry skin and rashes.  My husband has been using it quite a bit so time to buy more.</li>
    <li> I use this on cuts, scars, rashes, lips when they are chapped, ...almost everything. Not good for burns, but most everything else.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product, but you cannot find it in the local market.  I wish you could still purchase the 4 oz.&lt;br /&gt;All the good expensive stuff is disappearing from the store shelf.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that helps my dad&#x27;s muscle pain. It is amazing stuff. Really glad I found it in Amazon.</li>
    <li> THIS COMPANY WANTS TO LIE AND STEAL FROM YOU. THIS PRODUCT IS MADE WITH PETROLEUM..IT DOES NOT LIST IT. IT ALSO HAS FRAGRANCE THAT IT DOES NOT LIST EITHER..i HAVE NO RESPECT FOR A COMPANY THAT SELLS IT PRODUCTS AS ORGANIC, IN THE HEALTHSTORE AND IS JUST CRAP THAT IS BAD FOR YOU. THIS IS WHY I GO TO THE HEALTH STORE TO NOT BUY CRAP...THIS ITEM IS CRAP..SAVE THE MONEY IF YOU WANT CRAP BY VASELINE JELLY..ATLEAST THEY A RE NOT HIDING THE FACT THAT IT IS OIL MONEY.</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff works great on scard and elbows  and heals.  It really reduced the scar on my arm form a dog attack.</li>
    <li> I love this ointment because it is free of petroleum products. I use it for lip gloss and moisturizer,  put it on cuts and other abrasions, and find it very soothing. .</li>
    <li> Keep this product in stock. Love this product, it&#x27;s good for everything like dry skin, chapped lips, &amp; cuts, it heals them quickly.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that every time I order jars, I can&#x27;t order enough, I order them for my mom and grandma and I bought all that were In stock.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for your skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell so good.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for the skin it really helped with dry skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for the product it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> The ointment is very inexpensive but neverthless does seem to have a healing effect on some scar tissue.  The small jar lasts a long time because not much is needed each use.  Has quite a strong beeswax or cloves type of scent but not unpleasant.</li>
    <li> Solution for painful cracked feet</li>
    <li> really great product would recommend to every one to many words get tired of reading this I get tired of writing this</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I liked the price and it was shipped promptly I recommend this product. You will enjoy.</li>
    <li> I just ordered and had delivered to family members home while we travel, not have to haul a glass jar, however, the newer ones are made in different size plastic jars now.  LOVE this have used it for years - three ingredients: vit e, wheat germ, aloe vera. Smells faintly of cloves but disappears after few minutes.  Use on feet, hands, elbows, lips, face - ALL OVER - LOVE IT, please keep making it!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome I love this stuff,even when i gave one as a gift. He was very pleased with the smell and how organic it was.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for 5 years now I suffer a lot from dry skin and honestly it has improved my skin very much on days of irritation</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I have always kept it on hand but ran out&lt;br /&gt;and was very pleased to find it on Amizon.com....I am so greatful to have it in stock again...</li>
    <li> I bought this for age spots and wrinkles on my face.  E-Ointment smells of soft cloves.  It felt good on my face, relaxed me and my skin began healing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use E-Ointment for cuts, burns and age spots on my arms. I&#x27;m not sure how works, but the oinment disolves into my skin, isn&#x27;t greasy and little by little I feel better and my skin begins to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My parents were visiting last weekend.  Dad has had a flaky, red and notible patch of eczema in his eyebrow. I sent Dad the E-Ointment through Amazon, and they are using it every day.  We don&#x27;t know if it will work in certainty, but nothing else has.  I am confident that stress is a factor in healing and the amazing clove fragrance is sure to relax him about his ezcema to let the oinment work for him.</li>
    <li> I know it just seems like fancy vaseline but this stuff is truly remarkable!  It really cured my flaky lips and eyebrows.  Also used it on a burn and it healed beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
    <li> Great ointment! I don&#x27;t care if it is vaseline based or not, it seems to work extremely well for me. I have had a spot on my upper back that has been making me crazy with itching. My husband can&#x27;t see a thing to be causing it, so I thought dry winter skin, probably. Have been having him apply this to the spot and it works very well...finally. Before we would use a lotion and it didn&#x27;t do much at all, but this stuff makes all the difference. Maybe plain vaseline would do it too, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to have the extra ingredients in there, and that delicious clove smell is very soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the amount used (a little goes a long way) it seems a reasonable price for the product at around&lt;br /&gt;$8.00 a bottle, or $20 for three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may order the three-pack next time, as I am going to try it on my face next for wrinkles--will probably have to use a spatula for that, lol...</li>
    <li> My grandmother came across this product many years ago and I use it for everything!!! Cuts, sore muscles, and any discomfort can be relieved with this ointment.  I was so happy to find this on Amazon because its impossible to find in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended. I have purchased this ointment for years, and always have it available in my cabinet. I used this ointment when I was pregnant with my first child, and faithfully used it on my tummy every day.. I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks at all from my first pregnancy.. The second pregnancy, I did not use it as much. But got a few stretch marks the second time. Sure wish I would of used it every day though...</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this particular Vitamin E Ointment.  The first I bought locally but like everything else I use and like, it disappears from the shelf.  Thank the Lord for the Internet.  Yes, there are good things about the Internet.  I live in Ohio and Winters can be harsh to the skin, especially cuticles.  I am always, year round, applying this ointment into my cuticles and it gives a good appearance to my hands.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Use it daily.  Keeps my feet lubricated and feels nice.  Product keeps for years without appreciable loss of potency.  Recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> If you have scars from surgery or injuries this ointment will return your skin to its pre-injury status.  I just wish I knew about this product years ago!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and find it is excellent for small&lt;br /&gt;nicks and cuts,etc.  It is very soothing.</li>
    <li> makes me hemrhoids feel like they have been delivered from the clutches of a angels clasping fat hands of death</li>
    <li> I had a small jar of this ointment several months ago, and I&#x27;ve been searching for it everywhere (GNC, Whole Foods, various vitamin shops), and couldn&#x27;t find it in stock. I was eager to see the products availability become current on my wishlist and purchased more jars than I needed (just in case!). The sweet clove scent and thickness of the ointment assures you that it works. Good as gold.</li>
    <li> I use it at chapstick every night. I also used it on my dog&#x27;s bed sores on his legs and with consistent application, they went away in about a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I used to buy E-Ointment at walgreens from 2004 to about 2009 or 2010 then the E-ointment disappeared and walgreens started making their own. When I went to get the walgreens brand it wasn&#x27;t there so I decided to check on Amazon, and My Lord I found the original E-Ointment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ointment got rid of stretch marks that nothing else worked on. I put it on burns, I put it on chapped skin. Its just amazing! I see that others use it on wrinkles. I&#x27;m super happy!</li>
    <li> It is great, product works very well. I use it on everything. And it is available when I need it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitamin E for my dry skin and I decided to try this ointment. So far I am very pleased. It also has aloe in it which also influenced my decision to try it.</li>
    <li> my hands constantly would get splits at work from touching bleach all the time, using this on my hands and body, it&#x27;s really helped it heal and get softer. From what it use to be dry and rough, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Bought this product after having foot surgery where I was in a cast for weeks.  The bottom of my foot looked like the desert.  Have been using this product on my foot and it has really helped with remoisturizing the skin on my feet.  It also has a nice smell.  Bottle would have been better if it was shorter and wider making it easier to get to the bottom.</li>
    <li> This is the only product you need. . .for face, body, first aid, diaper rash. It does it all!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Use it all the time for dry lips to healing cuts and moisturizing inside my nose before traveling to prevent inhaling germs.</li>
    <li> My wife use this on all her skin issues and loves it.</li>
    <li> This is a great item. Have used it for years for many reasons.  Put it on everything.</li>
    <li> I was disappointment , the container I received did not state for muscular pain .&lt;br /&gt;So I got the wrong product .&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a mentholated scent .</li>
    <li> Great ointment for winter</li>
    <li> I had knee replacement surgery which left a 15 inch ugly slash in my right knee.  Every day I gently rubbed this ointment in and the knee has completely knitted itself together with nary a scar.  This is great stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this product - seems like I&#x27;m always scraping or scratching myself somewhere, and this helps it heal cleaner and more quickly. Also great for really dry skin. If my hands are cracking I put it on thick at night and let it soak in overnight.</li>
    <li> It is great, Good under eyes, On face , And winter hands too. , The price is a little high, But worth it,,,</li>
    <li> Work very good on scars.</li>
    <li> Biofreeze is faster but this seems to last longer on muscles that are sore.</li>
    <li> An excellent vitamin E ointment. Very useful for soothing irritated skin. I have used it to help minimize scarring from surgery. Highly recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> I got this quick and it&#x27;s great.</li>
