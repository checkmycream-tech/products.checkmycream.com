<li> I used the lanced to make a tiny hole, I had to wait a day and let it get a little infected (though I did use a cleaning agent and an antibacterial cream afterward) but a few minutes ago I opened up the hole and was able to use the extractor side just by pressing down, and out it came!</li>

<li> Mine has the hole drilled off center, its covered with a gritty grease or lube/dirt.  </li>
<li> But be careful not to drop it, and to keep it turned back into the handle for storage.</li>
<li> I thought it was the same as the other one made in Germany, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
<li> they all come at the same time and they are quite deep and hard to get to.</li>
<li> This order was a total waste of money.</li>
<li> I was excited about this tool because I have a lot of blackheads on my nose that drive me crazy that I can&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
<li> The lancet has a jagged side with a sharp piece of unfinished steel hanging off of it.  </li>
<li> It has an extremely sharp blade</li>
<li> I use the other end for blackhead extractions.</li>
<li> The knife part is not sharp enough and the circle end is way too small!!!</li>
<li> When it came to extracting millia or hard white bumps, they said they were not licensed to do so as it broke the skin.    </li>
<li> The product itself seems well made, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work very well for extracting the milia</li>
<li> The lancet end is well made and very sharp.</li>
<li> The lancet tool is very sharp, which makes whitehead extraction easier.</li>
<li> Either way, a waste of money.</li>
<li> No more waiting over a few days for it to work itself up a little at a time!</li>
<li> the hole is very small on this...making it hard to center over the blackhead.  </li>
<li> Extractor hole should be larger, centering the hole over blemish is extremely difficult.</li>
<li> The hole in the extractor tool is so small  </li>
<li> When you get it in the mail, it looks really shady.</li>
<li> This tool works well for getting small blackheads out, but when I used the lancet I had to push really hard just to get it to puncture the milia on my face.</li>
<li> This tool is hard to use.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a rip-off or you should leave this things to a  skin profesional</li>
<li> I like how you can screw and unscrew, but sometimes they rattle when you use them thats a little annoying.</li>
<li> This too is a useless tool.</li>
<li> Ill see if I can find the time to do a video review</li>
<li> it is impossible to see through the hole to place it on the area for extraction.  </li>
<li> , i know i&#x27;m not that stupid</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t break out that often and I&#x27;ve never had much of a problem with blackheads, but once in a while I get a ton of white heads on my chin- they all come at the same time and they are quite deep and hard to get to. Needless to say I end up having a nice little hole in my face for a while. I figured there had to be a better way to remove these and I got online and did some research and found the extractor. As I said before, my whiteheads are always deep so yesterday I used the lanced to make a tiny hole, I had to wait a day and let it get a little infected (though I did use a cleaning agent and an antibacterial cream afterward) but a few minutes ago I opened up the hole and was able to use the extractor side just by pressing down, and out it came! The end! No more waiting over a few days for it to work itself up a little at a time! Just be careful with this product and always clean your skin and the extractor/lancet before and after each use.</li>
    <li> It serves its purpose. When you get it in the mail, it looks really shady. I was hesitate to use it at first because of its presentation. After using it, I love it. I have had milia around my eyes ever since I was born. They are perfect for removing them.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this tool because I have a lot of blackheads on my nose that drive me crazy that I can&#x27;t get rid of. This tool works well for getting small blackheads out, but when I used the lancet I had to push really hard just to get it to puncture the milia on my face. I was a little dissapointed in the sharpness, but besides that it does pretty well. I like how you can screw and unscrew, but sometimes they rattle when you use them thats a little annoying.</li>
    <li> It does some of the job for you, but can&#x27;t get rid of everything. It was a decent tool all in all.</li>
    <li> I got this in three days the shipping was fast ...But once u get this item ..u have to un-screw it to use the stuff....but i love this   .,...Would recommend</li>
    <li> Please take this review into account only if you&#x27;re purchasing this to try to extract milia.  The product itself seems well made, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work very well for extracting the milia I have around my eyes.  Everyone says the lancet is super-sharp, but in my opinion it could be sharper.  The loop end didn&#x27;t work at all on my milia.</li>
    <li> Quality designed product at a great price. Extractor hole should be larger, centering the hole over blemish is extremely difficult. Maybe the one I got wasn&#x27;t drilled right.</li>
    <li> the service and shipping turn around time was excellent but the problem is that the instructions included with the product don&#x27;t really explain how to use it and i&#x27;ve tried different ways with no results, i know i&#x27;m not that stupid so either the product it&#x27;s a rip-off or you should leave this things to a  skin profesional</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite sturdy which is important as I&#x27;m an esthetician and I&#x27;ll be using it several times a day. The extractor end works very well and the metal is rounded nicely so it doesn&#x27;t damage the skin. The lancet end is well made and very sharp. I love that you can screw the implements into the handle so the lancet end doesn&#x27;t get damaged.</li>
    <li> I have been having a hard time having various facialists on cruise ships extract anything more than blackheads.  When it came to extracting millia or hard white bumps, they said they were not licensed to do so as it broke the skin.    I saw the lancet on Google and bought it at Amazon.  It is perfect!  It has an extremely sharp blade and I took care of two millia already with no pain or after effects.  I am always careful to clean the area and the lancet with alcohol first and use antiseptic cream afterwards.  I use the other end for blackhead extractions.</li>
    <li> If you want to buy this set for the lancet, don&#x27;t bother. I thought it was the same as the other one made in Germany, but it&#x27;s not. This one is made in Pakistan, the steel quality is very low, and the lancet blade is jagged (!). It&#x27;s not even worth paying the extra money to return it since the original shipment fee you paid isn&#x27;t reimbursed. This order was a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> It must be used by profesional. Too danger use at home if you do not have practice for this</li>
    <li> I have really enoyed my body Toolz Facial Lancet &amp; Ring Extractor.  I tend to get a good deal of black heads in my chin area and wanted something to help clean my skin out.  I have really enjoy this facial extractor!  Although, sometimes it is a little hard to use, I just got it for use for myself, so its exactly what I was looking for as far as quality and price.  I would recommend it to others in the same position.  However, if you are purchasing this for use on other people, I would recommend getting something nicer and a little better quality.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool if you use it carefully, the lancet and extractor do exactly what they are meant for, but if not used with care, the lancet can leave scars behind!  I would recommend to use it along with the loop extracting tool for better results</li>
    <li> The knife part is not sharp enough and the circle end is way too small!!! Nothing compared to what the doctors give you! Save your money!</li>
    <li> the hole is very small on this...making it hard to center over the blackhead.  My son has large blackheads, so this isn&#x27;t going to work very well for us I don&#x27;t think</li>
    <li> This product did not work the way I thought it should.  Either that or I&#x27;m  just not using it properly.  Either way, a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product is good for the extraction of whiteheads that are at the surface, but does not do a good job for blackheads. The lancet tool is very sharp, which makes whitehead extraction easier. Overall, a good product, especially when used in conjunction with the Kaz steam facial. However, if you want to extract blackheads, you&#x27;ll need to find a different method.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this thing.  I have only been able to use it twice on my own skin, but I use it on my 14 year old sister who&#x27;s sking is going a bit haywire right now.  Works like a charm and comes with easy to understand directions.</li>
    <li> The lancet is very sharp and easily pierces skin when needed.  The hole in the extractor tool is so small  it is impossible to see through the hole to place it on the area for extraction.  It does work well if one is lucky enough to get it to the right place.   The lancet and extractor are safely stored inside the tool barrel.  I find it easier to use the lancet without screwing it into the barrel.</li>
    <li> As good as a professional tool.  Dr. Oz says not to squish your skin and this is a good alternative to prevent damage.  The cone piece works well to clear pores.</li>
    <li> This product is not advertised properly.  Its states that it is professional quality.  its made in Pakistan.  Mine has the hole drilled off center, its covered with a gritty grease or lube/dirt.  The lancet has a jagged side with a sharp piece of unfinished steel hanging off of it.  I cant see much of anyone using it better yet a professional. Ill see if I can find the time to do a video review so I can actully show what I am talking about.  Spend another buck or two and get the tweezerman version.</li>
    <li> Blade is a bit crooked. This tool is hard to use. The tip is not sharp enough to help with much, and is a bit big.</li>
    <li> Worked as stated. I particularly like the sharp pointed end, because it makes getting white heads out much less stressful to the skin and tissue surrounding it. But be careful not to drop it, and to keep it turned back into the handle for storage. It is so delicate of a point that it can easily be bent. A very nice product.</li>
    <li> The lancet end works great. That&#x27;s why I bought it. The other end with the hole doesn&#x27;t work so great because the hole is too small.</li>
    <li> This too is a useless tool. It doesn&#x27;t do the job as it claims to do on the products description.</li>
    <li> Nice quality. Does the trick. Pro grade device. Have used it many times with no problems. Worth the money I spent.</li>
