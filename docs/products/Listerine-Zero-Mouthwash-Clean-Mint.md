      <li>I have great teeth</li>
      <li>Works great for what it is meant for.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a great antiseptic, so</li>
      <li>I was so  happy when I saw this product on the store shelves.  </li>
      <li>the taste is good, but I prefer the origional to this newer stuff    </li>
      <li>Really good call.</li>
      <li>if i had not used it, i didnt have a morning breath and when you use it in the morning you feel throughout the day the feeling as if you just used the mouthwash and your breath smell good too, plus it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
      <li>Once we tried it, we all loved it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve now been using Listerine Zero since September and foudn that I can keep it in my mouth for way longer than 30 seconds because it doesn&#x27;t burn and tastes really good.  </li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>I just tried it and love it!</li>
      <li>But the product is awesome doesnt have much burn to it at all.</li>
      <li>, the Listerine Zero has a more pleasant and refreshing taste</li>
      <li>Used before work, nice, fresh, seemed great.</li>
      <li>If it doesn&#x27;t cause sloughing for you, you are very fortunate and have my envy.</li>
      <li>flavor was good but foams up way to quick.</li>
      <li>This makes the product safer and more appealing to many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m confident that it&#x27;s killing germs and freshening my breath.</li>
      <li>I gargle with it and hold it back in my throat to kill the germs and it works perfectly.</li>
      <li>Still, I have to wonder what they&#x27;re using as an alternative to alcohol, and whether it&#x27;s safe.</li>
      <li>consumers will love Listerine Zero for its milder flavor, but there is one disadvantage that consumers need to know before they purchase:</li>
      <li>Since I have no evidence that this happens to many people I have rated it 3 stars instead of 5, but if this is something everyone experiences, I&#x27;d probably rate it</li>
      <li>It will not go away and will not get better.</li>
      <li>Its ok for mouthwash but DO NOT try to gargle with it.</li>
      <li>and I am able to keep it in my mouth longer, as directed.  </li>
      <li>But my favorite feature of this is the color.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>sure.</li>
      <li>I hope they never discontinue this - I love it.</li>
      <li>and I am quite glad I did.</li>
      <li>Love doesn&#x27;t have to hurt anymore.</li>
      <li>But I do not experience the peeling problems mentioned by many reviewers.  </li>
      <li>Double of a Walmart price, otherwise very good Listerine zero alcohol mouthwash.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than the original alcohol Listerine, and the peeling effect is easy to avoid if you make sure to rinse for UNDER 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it is awesome.  </li>
      <li>and now I can breathe easy</li>
      <li>just didn&#x27;t have that - and it tasted quite strongly of flouride.</li>
      <li>When I buy the really strong ones, I just add water to my strength, it works.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a nice crisp taste and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s coating your mouth like the Crest did.  </li>
      <li>Listerine Zero is a good alternative to the traditional Listerine product and it makes a good choice for those who cannot handle the intense flavor found in most of the Listerine lineup.</li>
      <li>Use with water pick pressure flosser, works fine.</li>
      <li>You get the same great clean as original listerine just without the burn!</li>
      <li>I love the long-lasting fresh breath that Listerine gives me</li>
      <li>So, those of you who, like me, are fans of the strong CLean Mint flavor of Listerine, you will find the same great flavor here.</li>
      <li>like the alchol free idea</li>
      <li>Mint,...has proven to be the primary choice for those of us working in the war zones.  </li>
      <li>This is a good product for those who are sensitive to the mouthwash with alcohol.</li>
      <li>Unfortunalely i&#x27;m new to shopping on Amazon.com and paid more for this then if I had went to the store!</li>
      <li>I swished the pleasant light blue concoction around in my mouth.</li>
      <li>I used this product for two months and original Listerine for 50 years.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect the benefits of the original, but the mouthwash still is a putdown.</li>
      <li>thought I preferred &#x27;original&#x27; because it leaves a nicer after taste</li>
      <li>We had a bottle of Peak pet friendly antifreeze with propylene glycol; they call it Sierra now.</li>
      <li>It is used for pool antifreeze and pet friendly automotive antifreeze.</li>
      <li>Another suggestion is to try a trial-size before buying the large size to be sure you are comfortable with using this.</li>
      <li>Listerine Zero Mouthwash, Clean</li>
      <li>Amazon.com offers this product at a good price, and after all, isn&#x27;t any price worth it if you haven&#x27;t been getting all the kisses you need?</li>
      <li>This one tastes amazingly good and is very comfortable to use when compared with other mouth washes with Alcohol.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this product for about 1 week.and have been pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Colgate Total</li>
      <li>Some consumers don&#x27;t want or need an antiseptic and some are rightfully nervous about the ingredients in some of the full- strength versions of Listerine.</li>
      <li>oils\\&quot; as the true Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>using regular Listerine in the morning is a good way to make yourself wake up.</li>
      <li>I like to look a the bottle and think how cool I am too.</li>
      <li>I have no evidence whether it is really helping me in preventing cavities and gengivitis, but for sure I cannot see any undesired effects.</li>
      <li>apparently the choice of most of the medical staff for certain concerns, Good taste, leaves you with a nice fresh feeling.</li>
      <li>but I quickly changed my mind when the &amp;#34;mouth peeling&amp;#34; began.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there are people who love this stuff, but it&#x27;s definitely not for me.</li>
      <li>This is pretty cheap</li>
      <li>Initially, I was very satisfied</li>
      <li>Overall, there&#x27;s a nice clean feel after using this mouthwash.</li>
      <li>My breath stays fresh all day - even longer than when I use normal Listerine, maybe because I use the product more often.</li>
      <li>Since I rinse two or three times a day, mostly with &#x27;original&#x27; I have occasionally rinsed with original Listerine for up to a minute; that has also caused some tissue to slough off the inside of my mouth.</li>
      <li>This lacks the intense burn and clean mouth feel of the stuff that uses alcohol to clean your mouth    </li>
      <li>/&gt;Listerine Zero certainly has a more pleasant flavor than the full- strength, heavyweight antiseptics Listerine is usually known for and the product deserves a chance for that reason alone.</li>
      <li>It leaves my mouth (including the inside of my cheeks) cool-feeling (temperature-wise) and fresh.</li>
      <li>Yeah, it&#x27;ll kill the germs and make everything minty fresh.</li>
      <li>Fresh and minty---and it lasts.</li>
      <li>Got it for $5...and it&#x27;s was worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>Afterward, my breath was indeed minty fresh, and all was right with the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, I love the strong mint of Listerine Cool Mint and this other mouthwash</li>
      <li>you know, the one made by the big toothpaste maker - and was a bit less than impressed with the flavor.</li>
      <li>good - just want a little burst of something - not skin removing - but something that shows me that bacteria is gone.</li>
      <li>, the next morning you get out of bed, you feel some film coming out of your mouth, though its gets better with time.</li>
      <li>This is my go to when I first get a sore throat.</li>
      <li>I tried this product out for the first time today (I literally bought it 40 min ago.)</li>
      <li>This is like that, it says Listerine on the bottle, but it&#x27;s more akin to a regular mouthwash like Scope.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of gargling hot lava first thing in the morning.</li>
      <li>Listerine Zero is nothing more than a simple mouthwash.</li>
      <li>After using Listerine Zero, I went out on a date with a pretty girl and got a kiss at the end of it.</li>
      <li>I have always used the regular alcohol-based listerine mouthwash before I went to bed for more than 5 years, but then I decided to try this when it was on sale.</li>
      <li>Well, I tried another brand first -</li>
      <li>In the process, it will slap you awake with the unadulterated sting of hot alcohol-on-flesh action.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used mouthwash years ago, and my dentist recently recommended I start again (help for my sensitive gums).  Listerine never really bothered me, but I thought I&#x27;d give this stuff a shot.  I don&#x27;t need the burn to know it&#x27;s working.  What I got instead of the burn was the \\&quot;mouth peel\\&quot; I&#x27;ve now seen mentioned in several online reviews.  Now that I&#x27;m aware of what I am experiencing, I am pretty put off, definitely enough to discontinue use.  I plan to return this product to the megastore where I purchased it at my earliest chance.</li>
    <li> If you have an unclean mouth, stop reading those dirty books and use this Listerine product. It works. Fresh and minty---and it lasts. Perhaps not through a garlic sandwich, but let&#x27;s get real here. Amazon.com offers this product at a good price, and after all, isn&#x27;t any price worth it if you haven&#x27;t been getting all the kisses you need? Now, neither Amazon nor I can guarantee this product will help in that area---but it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it. If kisses still evade you, then you may have a problem that even Listerine can&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> This lacks the intense burn and clean mouth feel of the stuff that uses alcohol to clean your mouth    the taste is good, but I prefer the origional to this newer stuff    maybe alcohol is too expensive now a days</li>
    <li> I just bought this from a local store (smaller bottle). I just tried it and love it! It does not burn at all. It leaves my mouth (including the inside of my cheeks) cool-feeling (temperature-wise) and fresh. I would prefer a stronger mint taste but it&#x27;s nearly perfect as it is! It certainly smells like typical mint listerine. All in all I&#x27;m confident that it&#x27;s killing germs and freshening my breath. I highly recommend you at least give this a try.</li>
    <li> This is pretty cheap so I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with mouthwash.  Well this is sort of like colored water.  In an effort not to throw it away I mixed it with a stronger mouth wash.  It works but I don&#x27;t think I would use it for a diluting agent.  When I buy the really strong ones, I just add water to my strength, it works.  Unless you like really bland you probably won&#x27;t like this.  No alcohol but no strength either - maybe good - just want a little burst of something - not skin removing - but something that shows me that bacteria is gone.</li>
    <li> I have been using Listerine for the last three years (since I tried it for the first time). I have no evidence whether it is really helping me in preventing cavities and gengivitis, but for sure I cannot see any undesired effects. It is now part of my daily routines (2-3 times per day after brushing) and I really appreciate the fact that in the US it costs one fourth the price I would pay it in Italy. Now I use to buy  a 1.5 liters bottle, which lasts about 3 and a half months.</li>
    <li> I used this product for two months and original Listerine for 50 years. After rinsing for around 45 seconds with &#x27;alcohol free&#x27; I noticed some dead skin slough off one cheek. Since I rinse two or three times a day, mostly with &#x27;original&#x27; I have occasionally rinsed with original Listerine for up to a minute; that has also caused some tissue to slough off the inside of my mouth. I&#x27;ve never noticed skin peeling when rinsing 30 seconds or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I preferred &#x27;original&#x27; because it leaves a nicer after taste; now I&#x27;ve found that it is the anti-tarter ingredient which leaves the aftertaste. I don&#x27;t think the occasional removal of presumably dead tissue from inside the mouth is a problem; it may be a benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put alcohol free in quotes because Listerine Zero has the following ingredients: water, sorbitol solution, propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzoic acid, sodium benzoate, poloxamer 407, sodium saccharin, flavor, sucralose, FD&amp;C green no. 3. There seems to be a difference of opinion whether propylene glycol is alcohol. It is used for pool antifreeze and pet friendly automotive antifreeze. We had a bottle of Peak pet friendly antifreeze with propylene glycol; they call it Sierra now. Their web site says it is formulated with propylene glycol to make it safer than conventional antifreeze for pets and wildlife</li>
    <li> I tried some of this I&#x27;ll say stuff. Its ok for mouthwash but DO NOT try to gargle with it. It just foams up out of your mouth. flavor was good but foams up way to quick.</li>
    <li> After using regular Listerine for years, I finally decided to give Listerine Zero a chance. Although it was a bit more expensive, it was pain free! No more early morning suffering. I do have to say, using regular Listerine in the morning is a good way to make yourself wake up. Overall, there&#x27;s a nice clean feel after using this mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Double of a Walmart price, otherwise very good Listerine zero alcohol mouthwash. Use with water pick pressure flosser, works fine.</li>
    <li> Got it for $5...and it&#x27;s was worth every penny.  Definitely will continue to use this in the future.  This is a good product for those who are sensitive to the mouthwash with alcohol.</li>
    <li> My kids have used mouth wash since they were six. We all have hated the alcohol that some of them have. When we found this one that didn&#x27;t have alcohol but yet was strong enough as if it did, why not try it.  Once we tried it, we all loved it.  One think that I personally do not like; however my kids think is fun, are the bubbles it makes when you gurgle. Other than that, it is awesome.  The minty flavor will last in your mouth for a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of gargling hot lava first thing in the morning. So I have long considered Listerine a kind of necessary evil. Yeah, it&#x27;ll kill the germs and make everything minty fresh. In the process, it will slap you awake with the unadulterated sting of hot alcohol-on-flesh action. Every morning I found myself hearing the infamous Ralph Wiggum quote ricocheting through my mind: \\&quot;Tastes like burning!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Listerine Zero. I was skeptical when I learned about this alcohol-free product which claimed to be gentle and pleasing on the delicate innards of my face. \\&quot;Mouthwash without the burn?!\\&quot; I yelled incredulously at no one in particular, chuckling at the nonsense of it all. BURNING is how mouthwash works, you see. The alcohol stings everything in your mouth, including bad breath germs. We live. The germs die. It is the natural order of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well folks, I don&#x27;t know how the good people behind Listerine have done it, but they really have delivered on their promise. I took a swig. I swished the pleasant light blue concoction around in my mouth. I noticed a slight tingling sensation but nothing like the burning of years past. Afterward, my breath was indeed minty fresh, and all was right with the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True story: After using Listerine Zero, I went out on a date with a pretty girl and got a kiss at the end of it. I have no idea if the two were related, but the Listerine definitely didn&#x27;t hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(There is only one problem with this product, and that is the insane grammatical error plastered on the front of the bottle: \\&quot;Proven to kill germs that cause bad breath on contact.\\&quot; Most people probably won&#x27;t care, but I don&#x27;t much like the smell of misplaced modifiers in the morning. So I&#x27;ve penciled in an ellipsis after \\&quot;breath,\\&quot; and now I can breathe easy again.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion: Get the mouthwash. Seriously, you no longer need to put up with regular Listerine, which slaps you in the face before it tells you it loves you. Love doesn&#x27;t have to hurt anymore. It&#x27;s not your fault. It&#x27;s not your fault. It&#x27;s not your fault.not your fault. It&#x27;s not your fault. It&#x27;s not your fault.</li>
    <li> I use listerine everyday. I feel it really does the job needed.i like the alchol free idea cause I dont want to be an alcholic, haha.</li>
    <li> It is what we expected. We reluctant to buying this product since we were introduced to it while we were in Sweden. It is the same product so we&#x27;re looking to our next purchase.</li>
    <li> Leaves an extremely unpleasant bitter taste in your mouth for 10-20 minutes after using it. Even after rinsing over and over with water it&#x27;s hard to get rid of.</li>
    <li> My 10 year old daughter does not like the burn of regular listerine and all the alcohol it contains and quite frankly I don&#x27;t always like it either. You get the same great clean as original listerine just without the burn! Great for children!</li>
    <li> I actually bought it from Walgreen.  But I do not experience the peeling problems mentioned by many reviewers.  Either Listeerine changed the formula or I&#x27;m not susceptible to that problem?  I suggest anyone teetering on the fence to buy small bottle try out.  Whether it works as well as alcohol version, I have no clue.  But alcohol is too aggravating for me.</li>
    <li> My dentist advised against using an alcohol based mouthwash.  There is growing evidence that alcohol seems to increase the risk of mouth cancers and this includes topical exposure via alcohol-based mouthwashes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this product for about 1 week.and have been pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Colgate Total, the Listerine Zero has a more pleasant and refreshing taste and I don&#x27;t think there is any risk of tooth staining which is an issue with mouthwashes that contain cetylpyridinium chloride (although stains can be removed by your dentist).&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any issues with mouth residue/peeling yet.</li>
    <li> We just got this the other day because it was on sale. My wife used it for 4-5 days and I tried it a couple of times. Right away, I noticed that my mouth was excessively dry, which is not normal after I&#x27;ve used any form of mouthwash (I&#x27;ve used dozens of kinds in my life). After the second time, I was done. My wife, however, used it a little more than me. All of a sudden, while eating the other day, the right side of her face started swelling up every time she ate something. Went to the doctor and was diagnosed with clogged salivary glands. She also mentioned that she noticed how dry her mouth was when using this product. This has been affecting her for 3 days now, although it&#x27;s beginning to subside now that she stopped using Zero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some would say coincidence, but we both react to things very differently, except this time. I will NEVER buy this type of Listerine again. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s no alcohol. Frankly, I prefer the ones with it instead. Stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> I love this! My gum pocket scores have improved from lots of 3s &amp; 4s to only one 4  + some 2s &amp; fewer 3s, when combined with the Colgate toothpaste with Pro-argin formula &amp; my Phillips Sonicare toothbrush. My dental hygienist recommends however, I need to also use the Listerine with fluoride as an active ingredient - so regrettably, I&#x27;m switching my Zero mouthwash too. That&#x27;s my only reason for giving it a 4...(I&#x27;ll miss the way it makes my mouth feel!)</li>
    <li> Listerine Zero is a good alternative to the traditional Listerine product and it makes a good choice for those who cannot handle the intense flavor found in most of the Listerine lineup. With Listerine Zero, there is no added alcohol and you do not feel any burn at all, making it much different than other Listerine antiseptics which are known for their strong burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many consumers will love Listerine Zero for its milder flavor, but there is one disadvantage that consumers need to know before they purchase: Listerine Zero is nothing more than a simple mouthwash. There is no antiseptic quality with this product, and that means it doesn&#x27;t fight gingivitis or help prevent other gum diseases. It is nothing more than a basic mouthwash, with little to offer other than the ability to fight a bad case of halitosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that Listerine decided to introduce Listerine Zero because it is a product that certainly has a market to serve. Some consumers don&#x27;t want or need an antiseptic and some are rightfully nervous about the ingredients in some of the full- strength versions of Listerine. Not only are the other products loaded with alcohol, they have some other questionable ingredients and can make an individual very sick if swallowed. Listerine Zero is toned- down to the point that, while still risky to consume, isn&#x27;t as likely to make a person very sick. This makes the product safer and more appealing to many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listerine Zero certainly has a more pleasant flavor than the full- strength, heavyweight antiseptics Listerine is usually known for and the product deserves a chance for that reason alone. It freshens breath, but doesn&#x27;t provide any other benefits such as lessened chance for developing gingivitis, restored tooth enamel, or stronger teeth. So, when all pros and cons are considered, Listerine Zero rates as average overall.</li>
    <li> If I could give negative stars, I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a 1 oz sample from my dentist and used it two times.  It caused skin inside my mouth to peel and painful sores which have lasted 4 days and counting.  This product is TERRIBLE.  It should be removed from store shelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; alcohol based Listerine daily without issue.</li>
    <li> This one tastes amazingly good and is very comfortable to use when compared with other mouth washes with Alcohol. You can actually rinse it in your mouth for 30-60 secs with out any discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;Good thing about not having alcohol is, alcohol actually dries your mouth with in turn promoted bacterial growth. So in a way this product is superior to other alcoholic mouth washes.&lt;br /&gt;BUT, the next morning you get out of bed, you feel some film coming out of your mouth, though its gets better with time.</li>
    <li> i mean i used this last night woke up and my break actually wasn&#x27;t as bad as i would&#x27;ve if i had not used it, i didnt have a morning breath and when you use it in the morning you feel throughout the day the feeling as if you just used the mouthwash and your breath smell good too, plus it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
    <li> We really like this mouthwash.   It came as a great gold box deal.  All the benefits without the sting and I am able to keep it in my mouth longer, as directed.  If you haven&#x27;t already, you should give it a try.</li>
    <li> You might wish to try this in a smaller purchase before this bulk purchase, as I found the side effect of this to be annoying. While it does burn less than the regular Listerine, it uses something that causes slight peeling of the skin in my mouth. The only other product that does this and has a similar taste/texture in the mouth is Crest Pro Health. This effect is not immediately obvious to me, but 30 minutes or so later I may find myself at work feeling like there is something in my mouth-- almost like a piece of wet tissue if you&#x27;ve ever had a tooth pulled or had gauze in your mouth. I put my finger in there to trace it out, and sure enough, it&#x27;s a small wadded up piece of white peeled skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not bad enough to not use the product, but it is strange, and you can feel the entire texture of the mouth where the skin is going to peel feel dry and rough before it happens. Other than this one disturbing feature, the mouthwash does what it should, freshens breath, and otherwise works. Since I have no evidence that this happens to many people I have rated it 3 stars instead of 5, but if this is something everyone experiences, I&#x27;d probably rate it even lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My summary here is to try this in a small purchase first before committing to the bulk buy.</li>
    <li> Add me to the growing list of folks suffering from &amp;#34;mouth peel&amp;#34; when using Listerine Zero. In some ways, I don&#x27;t even mind it as I imagine (as in completely imagining with no factual basis) that its getting rid of the parts of my mouth that cause bad breath. And when I regularly use this, it is very effective against my bad breath (which is the only reason it gets more than 1 star). But at this point I&#x27;m tired of the morning ritual of the surface layer of my mouth sloughing off and having to spit out the stringy wet, white tissue. It sounds gross and it is gross, but for all the sloughing, it doesn&#x27;t actually hurt at all. Its just gross.</li>
    <li> I was so  happy when I saw this product on the store shelves.  I love the long-lasting fresh breath that Listerine gives me but I really can&#x27;t handle the burn.  I had switched to Crest Pro-health at some point, but stopped using it when I found it was staining my teeth.  I&#x27;ve now been using Listerine Zero since September and foudn that I can keep it in my mouth for way longer than 30 seconds because it doesn&#x27;t burn and tastes really good.  My breath stays fresh all day - even longer than when I use normal Listerine, maybe because I use the product more often. My dentist even commented recently than my gums look better than they did during my last visit.  I hope they never discontinue this - I love it.</li>
    <li> Unfortunalely i&#x27;m new to shopping on Amazon.com and paid more for this then if I had went to the store! But the product is awesome doesnt have much burn to it at all. Esp when i&#x27;m waking up and the baby is crying and I just dont get a chance to sit him down and brush my teeth...this stuff is awesome!!</li>
    <li> Just like regular Listerine but without the burn. But my favorite feature of this is the color. It&#x27;s got that ice blue look, unlike the neon blue or neon green of regular Listerine. I like to look a the bottle and think how cool I am too.</li>
    <li> It is best water for mouthwash I ever use. Not &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; at all.</li>
    <li> will probably go back to regular listerine</li>
    <li> This is my go to when I first get a sore throat. I gargle with it and hold it back in my throat to kill the germs and it works perfectly. Not the burning alcohol kind that I never liked. This is strong enough to kill the germs, sooth the throat, but not feel like it is burning. It is an excellent breath freshener as well.</li>
    <li> I have always used the regular alcohol-based listerine mouthwash before I went to bed for more than 5 years, but then I decided to try this when it was on sale. It was probably a poor decision when I bought the large size because I started to get inner mouth peeling when I woke up every morning. I ignored it the first few days, but it just got progressively worse as I continued to use it throughout the weeks. I finally reached the point when I need to alternate days I&#x27;m using this now because I feel like the mouthwash is weakening my inner mouth skin and gums. Here is an overall summary of pros/cons I have found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) As advertised, zero alcohol means no burning whatsoever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Inner mouth peeling! A thin film develops over your gums and teeth, and the skin of your inner mouth becomes loose. [Read below for advice]&lt;br /&gt;2) I personally do not get a clean, minty aftertaste I used to get with the alcohol-based listerine. It feels like I rinsed my mouth with water and it still feels dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Do not buy this if you are comfortable with the regular alcohol-based listerine already, there is no additional benefit to switching to this type. If you do have problems with the irritation from the alcohol-based listerine, I would recommend this. HOWEVER, I would suggest that you rinse your mouth with a couple cups of water after using this to wash off residual mouthwash that will cause inner mouth peeling later. This will not completely remove the side effect, but it will reduce it. Another suggestion is to try a trial-size before buying the large size to be sure you are comfortable with using this.</li>
    <li> I use mouthtwash twice daily and have for a while. I recently found out about the \\&quot;no alcohol\\&quot; mouthwashs and thought I&#x27;d give one a try. Well, I tried another brand first - you know, the one made by the big toothpaste maker - and was a bit less than impressed with the flavor. First, I love the strong mint of Listerine Cool Mint and this other mouthwash just didn&#x27;t have that - and it tasted quite strongly of flouride. My dentist recommended Listerine Zero. Really good call. The flavor is the same, and the burn is decidedly less. Very good.     For those wondering whether the alcoholic mouthwashs are superior, they are not. Until recently, alcohol was the only way to get rid of the germs in the mouth. Listerine and other companies have since figured out non-alcoholic ways to get the same result. Same effectiveness, just no alcohol burn.    So, those of you who, like me, are fans of the strong CLean Mint flavor of Listerine, you will find the same great flavor here. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I was a Crest ProHealth user up until reading the reviews and realizing the brown staining on my teeth wasn&#x27;t from drinking coffee and tea.  So I switched to this.  It&#x27;s got a nice crisp taste and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s coating your mouth like the Crest did.  I understand now that it&#x27;s just mouthwash and has no cleansing abilities, but I don&#x27;t really need that.  If I do, I have a small bottle of regular Listerine.  Amazon&#x27;s price on this is terrible though.  I realized after placing the order, even with the subscribe and save, that it&#x27;s much more expensive than in any store.</li>
    <li> Listerine Zero Mouthwash, Clean Mint,...has proven to be the primary choice for those of us working in the war zones.  It is one of the few with limited alcohol and  apparently the choice of most of the medical staff for certain concerns, Good taste, leaves you with a nice fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this product for at least a month now &amp; although there is still some left, I think I&#x27;m ready to throw it away (even though it also came with a free small size we haven&#x27;t even touched yet)!  I don&#x27;t even normally write reviews, but I was driven to it after consistently experiencing the \\&quot;mouth peel\\&quot; everyone talks about which is accurate and just gets worse.  I found myself pulling strings of skin from my gums every morning &amp; once, one ended up on my lip mid conversation which was really embarrassing.  Anyway, the only reason I even bought this was because my normal Vanilla Listerine wasn&#x27;t on the shelf when they launched this so I had no choice.  I really hope they didn&#x27;t discontinue it because I want to go back...either that or switch brands!</li>
    <li> I have had issues in the past with alcohol based mouthwashes and decided to give this a try. Works great for what it is meant for. The strands of thick snot nasty white goo you are picking from your mouth for hours is unacceptable. Will be dumping rest out and won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than the original alcohol Listerine, and the peeling effect is easy to avoid if you make sure to rinse for UNDER 30 seconds. Still, I have to wonder what they&#x27;re using as an alternative to alcohol, and whether it&#x27;s safe.</li>
    <li> I tried this product out for the first time today (I literally bought it 40 min ago.) Got to work and went to the bathroom. I didn&#x27;t expect the benefits of the original, but the mouthwash still is a putdown. I did notice that I could gargle it much, much longer than the Listerine with alcohol, but upon spitting it out and waiting for a bit, I preferred the one with the extra ingredients. The aftertaste is very odd like a pen or some type of metal in my mouth. There was a filmy feeling in my mouth like a few other reviews pointed out. I just didn&#x27;t get that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling from this. I&#x27;m sure there are people who love this stuff, but it&#x27;s definitely not for me. I don&#x27;t even get a \\&quot;burning feeling\\&quot; from the other Listerine&#x27;s. it just happened to catch my eye, so I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this post is submitted, I&#x27;m sending my little brother to get the normal Listerine. Like someone else said, buy the small one if you want to try it out first.</li>
    <li> Used before work, nice, fresh, seemed great. Popped a piece of gum in my mouth (orbit) and it stuck to every single tooth. WTH? Maybe it&#x27;s the gum (I know it&#x27;s not, but sure. maybe) I work 12 hour shifts. Tried a piece of trident later. Same thing. Had to peel it out of my mouth. Huh..bizarre. Next day, used listerine again, same gum issue. I have great teeth btw...nice, straight, white, not full of plaque, no reason for gum to suddenly start sticking. Didn&#x27;t use the listerine for 2 days...gum back to normal :(&lt;br /&gt;Not going to use this anymore...</li>
    <li> Remember a couple of years ago when Neosporin released their \\&quot;Neo To Go\\&quot; and they claimed it was Neosporin yet it wasn&#x27;t? This is like that, it says Listerine on the bottle, but it&#x27;s more akin to a regular mouthwash like Scope. Yes, you will notice I am not a Verified Buyer of this product, it&#x27;s because I had the presence of mind to buy a 500mL bottle at a brick and mortar store to test it out and I am quite glad I did. The thing about alcohol, like other antiseptics, is that they burn for a reason, just think of all that Bactine, iodine, alcohol, or peroxide you used/use on cuts and scrapes, it HURTS, yet you keep using it. Listerine has been around for a very long time, and there is a reason it has alcohol in it, it&#x27;s a great antiseptic, so if you have cankers, ulcers, cuts, or other problems, it&#x27;s going to take care of it (and trust me I had plenty of ulcers growing up) and help them heal faster. But Listerine Zero lacks alcohol, so it really isn&#x27;t an antiseptic even though it contains the same traces of \\&quot;essential oils\\&quot; as the true Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listerine Zero is good if you want to freshen your breath after lunch as it is better than mints, that is if you do not have an adverse reaction to it like some other people on here do, but if you actually want to contribute to your oral health, especially if you have dental work such as a bridge, stick with the original Listerine brand. If the burn bothers you, try their orange flavor (it is less intense than my preferred flavor, Arctic Mint).</li>
    <li> It keeps your mouth fresh and is definitely less intense. Initially, I was very satisfied but I quickly changed my mind when the &amp;#34;mouth peeling&amp;#34; began. Others here have mentioned it and I have found out it is called &amp;#34;sloughing&amp;#34;, which is basically dead tissues shedding off en masse. It&#x27;s disgusting and annoying and the sloughing alone is worth changing mouth washes. It will not go away and will not get better. If it doesn&#x27;t cause sloughing for you, you are very fortunate and have my envy.</li>
    <li> It is just as advertised and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, that is give you a refreshed breath.  A very good product.</li>
    <li> I used Listerine before, but couldn&#x27;t handle the burning. So I bought this alcohol-free Listerine Zero, but I got hit by another problem. Everytime I use Listerine Zero I have a very dry mouth through the entire day. Even if I drink a lot or chew chewing gum, the dryness lasts through the entire day. I won&#x27;t buy this mouthwash again. I have no problems when I use Colgate or Crest or Act mouthwash, only Listerine gives me this annoying dry mouth. Thumbs down!</li>
    <li> Husband won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My dentist recommended this product particularly because of the lack of alcohol (less irritation) for reducing the bacteria in one&#x27;s mouth. I use it 2X a day.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and was well packed. I like the product because it does not have alcohol, which can dry out one&#x27;s mouth.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why anyone would use mouthwash with alcohol after you try this. I can&#x27;t go back.</li>
</ol>
