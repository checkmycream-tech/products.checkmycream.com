      <li>I use a mousse first, then comb my hair into place, then put a bit</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, and gives it nice texture.</li>
      <li>It probably isn&#x27;t strong enough for spikes.</li>
      <li>My hair is extremely fine and quite short.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call this a light whipped product, it is rather dense, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a big deal breaker.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Review Update 5 Stars to 1!!!!:&lt;br /&gt;The product is great, the company is a Slime Ball!!! We were told nearly 2 years ago by the Mega whip people that they were discontinuing this product.  Turns out nearly 2 years later the product is everwhere for sale at 3 TIMES the price! I was buying this for $12-$16 a bottle NOW after creating a fake shortage it is selling for a minimum of $36 on up.&lt;br /&gt;I have no use for dishonesty in anywhere especially the marketplace. Thus the 1 Star rating from the previous 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it if you support liars and cheaters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair and I have decided to let it grow out to cover a small bald spot (I&#x27;m 63).  I could not be happier as it controls my fine hair keeping it well shaped all day with no frizzy&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year and really like it.  Smells great (but not strong) just like marshmallow cream!  Does not make my hair stiff but firm enough.  Just need a little bit.</li>
    <li> Think  it does a great  job of what I want to do</li>
    <li> Love this product...hate that bed head has stopped making it.</li>
    <li> Love it, just as good as the one you would buy at the salon and CHEAPER!</li>
    <li> Works Great, but can be sticky in your hair if you use too much. I was hoping it smelled like Marshmallows.&lt;br /&gt;The look and feel is just like melted marshmallows, but it smells more like fresh lemons or citrus.&lt;br /&gt;Not unpleasant, but disappointing.</li>
    <li> Love this product and it works so well for my hsir</li>
    <li> Love it!  The best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I use this to keep my curls and separate them after using a curling iron. Works well and smells like sweet candy. Thought it would smell like marshmallows but nope. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is I do not like the jar. It makes getting the product messy and I noticed the product can dry out if you don&#x27;t close tight.</li>
    <li> Great product for shorter hair styles. Pixies, bob,mohawks ECT. Guys and Girls good for both. Smells lovely, it is lightweight, one of bed head&#x27;s best products. Hands down my new FAVORITE texturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this product for texturizing my hair, which is fine and damaged.  I can use just a smidge to run through my damp hair, and it dries in a perfectly styled manner.  Not dull, not sticky, not smelly.  My stylist uses this product on my hair when she blow dries my hair, and I always meant to look for it - I just knew Amazon..com would have it.  I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair, but let it air dry.  I wouldn&#x27;t call this a light whipped product, it is rather dense, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a big deal breaker.  It works to give me a piece-y look if that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m after, or something more subdued and blended.  It looks even better the day after I shampoo.</li>
    <li> this hair product is great for fine, straight hair like i have. it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, and gives it nice texture.</li>
    <li> For a friend. this is what she indicated.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, calms Down the frizz on my straw like ends, but is a little to thick and I had to stir it around with a chopstick so I could use it better.</li>
    <li> Just tried this always used Manipulator -- I have an asymmetrical cut and this is a very nice smoother lighter weight than the other&lt;br /&gt;Way better price THANK YOU AMAZON AGAIN than in the salon.</li>
    <li> love this product...cannot find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> saw this product on a talk show, took me a long time to get this product, always out&lt;br /&gt;of stock, once I did received it I&#x27;m really not impress with it, I do love the way it smells....</li>
    <li> This texturizer molds hair the way you want without making it look greasy or unclean. It&#x27;s fragrance is to die for!</li>
    <li> This product smells WONDERFUL, but I have long hair (below my shoulders) and would probably work better on shorter hair.</li>
    <li> One of the best hair products ever.....hard to find and now I know why!  Easy to use...helps keep my shirt curly hair looking great all day long</li>
    <li> I have been using this for awhile and I love it its not sticky hard or greasy. Great for a quick style</li>
    <li> My son and I both love this hair product.  It has a nice smell and controls the hair without making it too stiff.  We&#x27;ll definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Really love this.  Holds my hair style and doesn&#x27;t take much.  Jar lasts a long time.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great product, but almost double the price at Hair supply store.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair, rub a tiny bit in the palm of my hands rub it through my hair blow dry and I actually look like I have a full head of hair, wish I had this years ago</li>
    <li> Used this product for 2 years.Tthe best I have found for texturizer my hair</li>
    <li> I thought it would help to keep my hair in place, or a little of piecing  It didn&#x27;t seem to do it her</li>
    <li> I really love this product and it has given me the hair I&#x27;ve always wanted. That is not an exaggeration. I looked for the best pomade/product/gel/mousse for pixie cuts that would provide hold and defined texture, and this is the best I&#x27;ve encountered. I have colored, short hair, which is naturally curly and fine. I wear a pixie cut and without product my hair is enormous and terrible looking. I use a mousse first, then comb my hair into place, then put a bit (small scoop, like the size of a half dollar) in my hands and run it over my hair. I apply most to the side part and the front. I go to work, by the time I arrive I give it a little tousle to make it less &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; looking, and it is a perfect hairdo.  I&#x27;ve tried to substitute with other products but have found most of them leave a residue if you touch your hair after they dry. This does not. It just loosens up a bit but keeps the shape and hold. I love it.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a friend and she was spot on it is great to give hair lift and separation</li>
    <li> great product but expensive; can&#x27;t find it local and too costly to purchase through Amazon</li>
    <li> Nice product, hard to find in stores. It is creamy and does not make hair stiff. The smell is the best thing.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  But it has been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had more!</li>
    <li> Smells great, holds great.  I have fine hair and just a small amount rubbed between my fingers then on my hair gives me excellent hold!  I rarely use product in my hair but once I smelled this at my beautician&#x27;s I had to have some.  I love it on days when I want to so a little something with my hair!</li>
    <li> Greasy, no hold, and a strong fragrance.  Not for me...and not worth the cost, that&#x27;s for sure.  I have very short hair and was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great to give some lift to my short fine hair.  It is my understanding that Bedhead no longer makes this product. Too bad.</li>
    <li> Fake! Came and cream was shriveled up in a solid block, couldn&#x27;t even use. Not the real stuff.</li>
    <li> This is really good texturizer and it smells good too!!  Dropped the little tub on the floor, and even the dog likes it.  Good product, good service.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Light, non-greasy, smells great.  Unfortunately, I can no longer get it.  My stylist told me this product has been discontinued.  Maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s going for $35 now.  That&#x27;s absurd.  If you&#x27;re dumb enough to pay $35 for this, you&#x27;re dumb enough to buy anything.</li>
    <li> For one it smells like marshmallows, can&#x27;t go wrong with that! My mom LOVES this stuff, it doesn&#x27;t make her hair greasy/oily, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the way it holds my high in place.&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for a few years and am really happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help with fly aways. It does an ok job. It smells delicious! .. .. ..</li>
    <li> Was frozen or old or both</li>
    <li> Awesome for thin fine hair.</li>
    <li> Sometimes when I use this product my hair looks great and other times it doesn&#x27;t hold at all. Kind of makes my hair sticky, knotty, and dry. Will try something else next time.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a product for my new short haircut, when I saw the reviews on this and decided to give it a try.  It is great! It gives me just the textured and piecey look that I wanted.  It took a few tries to get the correct amount for my particular haircut, so stick with it.  It seemed a little pricey at first, but now I can tell that it doesn&#x27;t take much and should last a long time. And the smell is yummy.  Neither feminine nor masculine, just a very subtle, pleasant smell. Sometimes I just like to sniff myself it smells so good!</li>
    <li> Whenever I wear this stuff, I cannot keep the women away from me.</li>
    <li> It smells good but I didn&#x27;t see any great results. Seemed to flatten my hair. I like redken 7 sculpting paste better.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser has used it on my hair at the shop but she was not able to find it at the salon shops. I went on Amazon and found it.. My hair can be difficult to work and I found this product works great.. No heaviness or stickiness. totally recommend . !!</li>
    <li> Actually, I haven&#x27;t used the product but my hairdresser uses it on my hair an it turns out better to when I do my own. My one star is strictly on the package directions. The font can only be read by an ant, they&#x27;ve crammed every language + ingredients onto the jar! then plastered a blank 3&amp;#34; white label over directions where there&#x27;s also dark blue stripes over the info. Who does that?</li>
    <li> I really like this haid product, it will make my hair stay put without it looking stiff or like ive been bathed in gel.</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely fine and quite short. It&#x27;s been hard to find a hair product that gives me style that isn&#x27;t inordinately expensive or leaves my hair feeling goopy. I tried this product at a friend&#x27;s house, and was immediately hooked. It gives my hair texture, which I can never achieve without LOTS of hairspray. I can style and restyle my pixie cut throughout the day. And it also allows my hair to not look like garbage after wearing a winter hat for 20 minutes or so. The two things I don&#x27;t like about this product is the &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34; cap and the smell. Because it has a unique top, I can&#x27;t put another container on top of it. When you have limited real estate in your bathroom, this can be a detriment. And yes, I realize it is marshmallow scented, but I would prefer it to not be fragranced. That being said, I&#x27;m not going back to my &amp;#34;got2b&amp;#34; line of products. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product, it has a wonderful scent that my girlfriend and her friends love, you don;t have to use much especially if you have shorter hair. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> REALLY REALLY WONDERFUL ITEM, SUPER FAST SHIPPING AND I LOVE THE SMELL OF THE TEXTURIZER! I LOVE WHEN MY HAIR STYLIST USES IT, SHE COULDN&#x27;T SELL IT TO ME, SO I CAME TO AMAZON.COM TO FIND SOME FOR MYSELF!</li>
    <li> I ordered this shortly after ordering the Tigi Beadhead \\&quot;hair meringue\\&quot; which smells just like lemon meringue pie so I was hoping this stuff smelled like marshmallows! It doesn&#x27;t. It smells sweet, which is good, but the other product&#x27;s scent made me believe this one might smell like what it&#x27;s being compared to as well. It works okay but has very little hold and is a little greasy. Not my favorite.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a hair product that would give my hair some texture and lift. This product is the best one I have used. Highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> The seller was fantastic, but the Mega Whip gave me a horrible allergic reaction on my hands and I had to throw the whole jar in the garbage.  :o(  Don&#x27;t know what was in it that reacted so badly with my skin.  I do have sensitive skin and am prone to eczema, but most hair products do not cause such a violent reaction on my hands.  Anyway, my hair liked it and it smelled good... just wish it didn&#x27;t cause me weeks of grief waiting for my swollen, painful, fingers to heal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really thick so it&#x27;s hard to spread evenly through your hair so you may get some greasy looking areas. Otherwise, it smells great and does it&#x27;s job</li>
    <li> I have short curly hair and believe this product has got to be for long and straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair straightened out after use and looks awful.</li>
    <li> My hair was very I thought greasy.  When I applied the whip it did not distribute well.  I pu it in my hands and distributed it through my short hair but my hair seemed very dirty and greasy afterward.</li>
    <li> As good as in the store but with a better price. It holds, but let&#x27;s you manage your hair.</li>
    <li> I have a short pixie cut, and this product is great for holding my hair without being stiff, and giving it texture. (I have babyfine, naturally curly hair, though I have it cut short enough that the curl doesn&#x27;t really show). I love the smell. I&#x27;m not sure it smells like marshmallows, but it smells delicious. The price is kind of high but a little goes a long way. You can probably get at least 3 months out of a jar; I think I got more like 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for creating a tousled look. It probably isn&#x27;t strong enough for spikes.</li>
    <li> I love the slight hold this gives my waves.  Also, &amp;#34;a little dab&#x27;ll do ya!&amp;#34;  I use a tiny amount on my thick hair, so one jar lasts forever</li>
    <li> holds in place gives good texture to short  hair</li>
    <li> Love it.  Can&#x27;t buy it locally.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel dirty when I&#x27;m wearing it, but it gives my fine hair AMAZING texture and body. I was running errands the other day and someone commented on how they could never wear their hair like mine because their hair was too thin. They were AMAZED when I told them I have thin hair, too. This stuff is AWESOME!</li>
