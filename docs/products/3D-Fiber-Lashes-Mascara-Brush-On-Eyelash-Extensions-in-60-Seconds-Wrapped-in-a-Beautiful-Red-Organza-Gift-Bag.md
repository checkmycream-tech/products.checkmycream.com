      <li>Practice makes perfect!</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome!!</li>
      <li>Once you learn how to apply, its great</li>
      <li>Definately not as good as Moonstruck 3D fiber lashes.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product!</li>
      <li>This is amazing.</li>
      <li>It is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>This stuff is nice but it flakes off into your eyes after about 12 hours of wear.</li>
      <li>Does not do what&#x27;s promised, younique is better .</li>
      <li>Works as well as the original that is $10 more  Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>The price was better than others too.</li>
      <li>They are comparing to YOUNIQUE which is truly incredible mascara (I shop from youniqueproducts.com/fastlash) and all natural and hypoallergenic.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh when I saw this product claiming to compare to &amp;#34;youniqe&amp;#34; mascara in the title.</li>
      <li>The quality seems to match the lack of care taken in properly explaining their own product.</li>
      <li>and it works as well as it did the first time.</li>
      <li>it came with no instructions as to which one to use first......</li>
      <li>If they don&#x27;t take care to spell check their own advertisement, I would not be putting such a product anywhere near my skin.</li>
      <li>Have used other more expensive products and this is the best!</li>
      <li>Really works</li>
      <li>Arrived fast and as described.</li>
      <li>I like other brands better, but would purchase again if this was the only one available.  </li>
      <li>For people using this mascara, the first time you may not see a difference, but after a few times of getting used to applying it to your lashes you get better at it and see a difference.</li>
      <li>And I am definitely considering buying more in the future!</li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes!</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the results especially when compared to much more expensive products very similar to this same item.  </li>
      <li>Clearly these reviews all speak for themselves.  </li>
      <li>As good as any expensive brand on the market.</li>
      <li>The packaging is pretty, but the clear gel is dried out and there were no lashes in the wand part.</li>
      <li>Plus as seen clearly on the picture and description it should come in a red pouch...</li>

<ol>
    <li> Arrived fast and as described.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! Have used other more expensive products and this is the best! Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. No need for false eyelashes. It is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> The lashes fall off nonstop &amp; I read the directions throughly. My eyes were all red &amp; irritated from the tiny hairs that fell off after application! I didn&#x27;t like this stuff at all.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!</li>
    <li> I like other brands better, but would purchase again if this was the only one available.  Worked for what I wanted it to do.  The price was better than others too.</li>
    <li> As good as any expensive brand on the market.</li>
    <li> I had tried younique, and was looking for something less expensive. The packaging is pretty, but the clear gel is dried out and there were no lashes in the wand part. Very disappointed. Do not buy. Pay the 30 bucks for younique.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh when I saw this product claiming to compare to &amp;#34;youniqe&amp;#34; mascara in the title. The quality seems to match the lack of care taken in properly explaining their own product. They are comparing to YOUNIQUE which is truly incredible mascara (I shop from youniqueproducts.com/fastlash) and all natural and hypoallergenic. Clearly these reviews all speak for themselves.  The product is in no way comparable to younique and I would be cautious of using such a product around your eyes. If they don&#x27;t take care to spell check their own advertisement, I would not be putting such a product anywhere near my skin.</li>
    <li> It definitely lengthens the look of the eyelashes but I need to check every now and then if there are black fibers on my under eye. Plus as seen clearly on the picture and description it should come in a red pouch...mine came in an ordinary box which looked worn and old.</li>
    <li> Definately not as good as Moonstruck 3D fiber lashes.</li>
    <li> This mascara is awesome! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and it works as well as it did the first time. For people using this mascara, the first time you may not see a difference, but after a few times of getting used to applying it to your lashes you get better at it and see a difference. Practice makes perfect! And I am definitely considering buying more in the future!</li>
    <li> Does not do what&#x27;s promised, younique is better .</li>
    <li> This stuff is nice but it flakes off into your eyes after about 12 hours of wear. I have sensitive eyes! Beware</li>
    <li> it came with no instructions as to which one to use first......</li>
    <li> It worked well. I only needed one coat even though the directions said three. That just made it to clumpy looking. I did NOT need mascara in addition to it.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the results especially when compared to much more expensive products very similar to this same item.  Will be buying again for myself and stocking stuffers!</li>
    <li> Works as well as the original that is $10 more  Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure I used it correctly as after brushing in the gel first and then the fibres  , some  loose fibres went in my eye I was in pain so  I had to wash it all off . I will try to do it again  soon but reluctantly .</li>
    <li> This is amazing. Really works</li>
    <li> Once you learn how to apply, its great</li>
