      <li>This is great stuff.  </li>
      <li>After years and years of not being able to find the perfect sunscreen for my family...</li>
      <li>Wonderful , easy transaction.</li>
      <li>even a soaping doesn&#x27;t remove it (that&#x27;s good for any water enthusiast).  </li>
      <li>Very good protection and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I am so very, very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>Love that is Non-GMO and no oxybenzone in it!</li>
      <li>First of all - it smells great!  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>It has a nice cocoa smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/</li>
      <li>This one is rated highly effective and is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>You need to warm it up, somehow (put it in your pocket for about 20 min) before applying or it won&#x27;t apply very smoothly.  </li>
      <li>It is probably the best eco friendly sunscreen on the market right now.</li>
      <li>Best natural sunscreen stick I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>Best effective product (with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide) on the market goes on without the ghost white film .  </li>
      <li>I have bought 6 products and love them.</li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite sunscreen for my face.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It does seem to blend in a bit better than the lotion.</li>
      <li>I love the fact there are no chemicals.</li>
      <li>My kids and teens love it too</li>
      <li>This goes on okay.</li>
      <li>lotion is better???</li>
      <li>is that better?</li>
      <li>I could get more wrinkles by trying to apply it on my face than getting wrinkles from the sun.</li>
      <li>Oh well that said I love this brand and would purchase it again.</li>
      <li>The product is easily applied, has great staying power and not to mention it is completely void of any harmful chemicals (my favorite part!)  </li>
      <li>I love this stick for easy touch-ups of sunblock on the go.  </li>
      <li>It has a very good safety score with ewg&#x27;s skin deep database.</li>
      <li>Best thing about this is it floats in water and you can apply it on wet skin or underwater.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily though, and it stays on in the water.</li>
      <li>I find that the stick was slightly more of a matte finish than the cream in the tube, but I liked the spreadability of the cream so much that I use that one on my face anyway.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen as it is easy to apply and a safe, chemical free option that really works!!</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s important to know what you&#x27;re buying.</li>
      <li>I do think that the whiteness gets better after about an hour, but I don&#x27;t think that this is supposed to be absorbed</li>
      <li>But it goes on smooth and works well.</li>
      <li>(I was looking primarily for something I could wear on my face and use on my children)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that this is the case with all sunscreens so in that case it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s white</li>
      <li>This is the first time we have tried this type of sunscreen and so far so good.</li>
      <li>We bought this from a  recommendation from http://www.tropicalsnorkeling.com/best-snorkeling-sunscreen.html fro our 1st trip to Hawaii, we are all very fair skinned and this worked well on sensitive areas like your nose, ears and back of your neck.</li>
      <li>That product is not as eco-friendly or organic, but provides better UVB protection, and similarly high UVA protection.</li>
      <li>Yes, it shimmers a nice, bright, purplely white color on facial hair.</li>
      <li>but we are pleased with the product so far.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s natural ingredients, but, for the kids sake, would love something easier to apply.</li>
      <li>Nice and small makes it easy to put in backpack, biking bag, etc.  </li>
      <li>Only challenge is making sure not to misplace it.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;d pay more if it came in a larger size.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been out in a burning hot sun, so</li>
      <li>(that also meets my standards for no weird ingredients).  </li>
      <li>I used aveeno baby, also rated 1 in ewg, but decided to change because R.E has higher</li>
      <li>This is the first stick sunscreen that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>That way, you know EXACTLY where you are putting the sunscreen, so you don&#x27;t miss any part of your babies</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m tempted to buy the tinted version, which will most likely result in an orange or bronze face--</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, Raw Elements spf30 is good stuff that I&#x27;ll probably buy again.  </li>
      <li>The second time I used it, I made sure to shave, but still applied too much.</li>
      <li>After trying several other brands of similar sunscreen, I have to say we like this one the best.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the raw, nutty, sunflower seedy scent of the stick...smells good enough to eat!!  </li>
      <li>Not one to give up easily, on the third application I applied it on select, non-stubble areas and rubbed it around with my hands.</li>
      <li>So I store it for certain occasions.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t whiten the skin as much as others do.  </li>
      <li>much so</li>
      <li>I think I may use shiseido&#x27;s  ultmiate sunscreen for face (ZnO 13% and TiO )if I want oil-free, non-breaking out product, and very water resistant sunscreen  for usage in beach or sports.</li>
      <li>So, being able to apply on wet skin can be a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, I feel like my skin gets rubbed too much when I apply on face because it is \\&quot;hard\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>and it really stays on after I sweat when I exercise.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply one handed and small to fit in pocket.  </li>
      <li>You can put in on really thick so that you have a nice layer of sunscreen that will last pretty much all day.</li>
      <li>There was no issue AT ALL with getting it out of the tube and rubbed right in leaving NO trace of white residue.</li>
      <li>I would apply first thing in the morning (6am) and surf for 3 or 4 hours and still have my face white from the sunscreen.</li>
      <li>My other favorite sunblock is Bullfrog, but it doesn&#x27;t last all day like this stuff.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t think I need to wear raw element or any  kind of water resistant sunscreen for daily use.</li>
      <li>The more you rub it in, the less white your skin</li>
      <li>It just applies almost clear</li>
      <li>I tried Badger sunscreen, which is another non-toxic sunscreen, but it was much too white and greasy.  </li>
      <li>However, what I didn&#x27;t realize was that it does not soak in, at all, so for the whole day I had ghostly white stubble face.</li>
      <li>Plus - it is natural and doesn&#x27;t contain a ton of chemicals.  </li>
      <li>ALL natural products will be opaque and this is no exception.</li>
      <li>I was looking for the most natural sunscreen possible, and came across Raw Elements.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably not good if you have acne prone skin because it is heavy, but if you need something to protect you in the water this stuff is great.</li>
      <li>I suppose I could see that if the tube was in a cold room, you might need to warm it up a bit first, but ...</li>
      <li>The first time I used this was on a four  hour bike ride and returned with absolutely no evidence of sunburn!  </li>
      <li>little girl in my son&#x27;s swim class just stared at him for a few minutes - I&#x27;m sure she was interested in why he looked so odd.</li>
      <li>Not sure how long it will last, but fits easily in a purse.</li>
      <li>It is a bit pricey for a tiny stick, but so far it is the only stick I&#x27;ve used that I like</li>
      <li>the ONLY active ingredient is Zinc Oxide and EVERY single other inactive ingredient is a completely natural product (mango butter, green tea, black tea, cocoa butter, etc ... ) Sounded too good to be true and based on some other reviews about the consistency,</li>
      <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t glide on as smooth as I thought it would...which is tough on my kids.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This goes on okay. It does seem to blend in a bit better than the lotion. Very small stick. Not sure how long it will last, but fits easily in a purse.</li>
    <li> Best natural sunscreen stick I&#x27;ve found. ALL natural products will be opaque and this is no exception. But it goes on smooth and works well.</li>
    <li> This is the first stick sunscreen that I&#x27;ve used. My toddlers don&#x27;t like putting sunscreen on their faces, but they actually tolerate this. It does leave them with fairly white faces though. I do think that the whiteness gets better after about an hour, but I don&#x27;t think that this is supposed to be absorbed much so maybe that&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s wearing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One little girl in my son&#x27;s swim class just stared at him for a few minutes - I&#x27;m sure she was interested in why he looked so odd. It goes on easily though, and it stays on in the water. It has a very good safety score with ewg&#x27;s skin deep database. I can tell where it&#x27;s still applied based on how white it is, and it does rub off quite a bit when they rub their faces (as kids do in the water). I&#x27;m sure that this is the case with all sunscreens so in that case it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s white and I can see when it may need reapplied.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! And blends in well with skin if you don&#x27;t put too heavy of a layer on.</li>
    <li> Best effective product (with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide) on the market goes on without the ghost white film .  My kids and teens love it too</li>
    <li> Not all sunscreens are created the same. This one is rated highly effective and is very easy to use.As a very pale Irish-American with children I think it&#x27;s important to know what you&#x27;re buying. It has a nice cocoa smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/</li>
    <li> We bought this from a  recommendation from http://www.tropicalsnorkeling.com/best-snorkeling-sunscreen.html fro our 1st trip to Hawaii, we are all very fair skinned and this worked well on sensitive areas like your nose, ears and back of your neck. As far as applying it elsewhere it was a bit stiff and harder to cover, so we just ended up using it on our nose, ears and necks.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  Easy to apply one handed and small to fit in pocket.  Great for surfing and outdoor activities</li>
    <li> Great protection from the sun!</li>
    <li> I purchase this item for all the things that is doesn&#x27;t contain, but the stick is just very hard and when it does come off on your skin it is pieces that you have to rub in (not fun for face)- perhaps- lotion is better???</li>
    <li> This is the first time we have tried this type of sunscreen and so far so good. Two days in the sun at the beach and no burning. You have to reapply about every 2 hrs but we are pleased with the product so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars!!  Exceeded my expectations!!  After years and years of not being able to find the perfect sunscreen for my family...THE WAIT IS OVER!!  We have been using the ECO STICK for a few days shy of a month.  My husband works outside and I got this for him to use on his face, neck and ears during work.  I also purchased this product in the bottle/cream formula and have been using it for my face/body. Works perfectly!!  The product is easily applied, has great staying power and not to mention it is completely void of any harmful chemicals (my favorite part!)  I really enjoy the raw, nutty, sunflower seedy scent of the stick...smells good enough to eat!!  No burns in sight and not the slightest bit of tanning is occurring in the applied areas.  I am extremely happy with this product!!  :0)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not docking any points off for this, but this is a very hard sunscreen stick.  You need to warm it up, somehow (put it in your pocket for about 20 min) before applying or it won&#x27;t apply very smoothly.  Warming it also eases rubbing it into your face...not warming it can actually be a painful \\&quot;massage\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you do get Raw Elements on, it&#x27;s difficult to get off...even a soaping doesn&#x27;t remove it (that&#x27;s good for any water enthusiast).  However, it&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;migrate\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t whiten the skin as much as others do.  The more you rub it in, the less white your skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this sunscreen when I surf. I surf for 2-4 hrs at a time and have very little pinkness and no burning when I get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Raw Elements spf30 is good stuff that I&#x27;ll probably buy again.  Considering this .6 oz stick only lasted me about 10 days (and that was only face and hands), I&#x27;d pay more if it came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a big wave surfer, and I figure he must&#x27;ve tried a lot of different sunscreens in his lifetime.  I tried Badger sunscreen, which is another non-toxic sunscreen, but it was much too white and greasy.  This stick applies on with a slight white tint, but it will rub into the skin.  I also like that it has a matte finish (not shiny) and it really stays on after I sweat when I exercise.</li>
    <li> I love the fact there are no chemicals. I hate the fact that it stinks horibbly and it changes the color of your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stick for easy touch-ups of sunblock on the go.  It is a bit pricey for a tiny stick, but so far it is the only stick I&#x27;ve used that I like (that also meets my standards for no weird ingredients).  Nice and small makes it easy to put in backpack, biking bag, etc.  Only challenge is making sure not to misplace it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It doesnt turn you completely white like other products and not too greasy for my family. I have bought 6 products and love them.</li>
    <li> After trying several other brands of similar sunscreen, I have to say we like this one the best. Goes on easily and easy to apply.  My only complaint would be - it&#x27;s very small. Seriously about twice the size of a Chapstick. I was expecting something at least the size of a deodorant stick. Oh well that said I love this brand and would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Just too sticky for me!  The tube was also very small, not quite what I expected.</li>
    <li> Very good protection and easy to use.</li>
    <li> First of all - it smells great!  (so unlike other sunscreens).  However, it doesn&#x27;t glide on as smooth as I thought it would...which is tough on my kids.  Obviously, there&#x27;s a need to constantly re-apply if you&#x27;re in and out of the water.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it because of it&#x27;s natural ingredients, but, for the kids sake, would love something easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Comes off in the water while I surf. Not sure why.</li>
    <li> Love this! I feel totally protected from the sun after applying this stick! I don&#x27;t care if it leaves a white sheen on my face, it eventually blends in.</li>
    <li> My kids HATE the smell of this. We used it once. It seemed to protect their faces well but I can&#x27;t get them to put it on again. It really does have a horrible smell. Going in the trash.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sunscreen but was a bit disappointed. I haven&#x27;t been out in a burning hot sun, so I don&#x27;t know how well it works, although I trust other testimonials. I just listed a few pros and cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I need to wear raw element or any  kind of water resistant sunscreen for daily use. So I store it for certain occasions. It has fairly long expiration date-2 years- so I&#x27;m happy with that. Best thing about this is it floats in water and you can apply it on wet skin or underwater. I don&#x27;t like going in the sunlight to begin with, and hate going underwater at the beach, but this will be useful if I go to water parks. Some people may want to apply to face or body while still under the water at the beach instead of coming out and drying. And they can this tiny stick in bikini pocket or swimsuit shorts. It floats in water so you won&#x27;t accidentally drop it and let it sink deep down the ocean. I also think if I go to waterpark, I wouldn&#x27;t want to bring stacks of towel to dry myself every two hours to reapply sunscreen. So, being able to apply on wet skin can be a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; I used aveeno baby, also rated 1 in ewg, but decided to change because R.E has higher ZnO. However, the product doesn&#x27;t rub or apply well like other sunscreen stick. Youtube shows it applies underwater and you can see thick white stuff, but no matter how hard I try it doesn&#x27;t apply like that. It just applies almost clear so I&#x27;m worried if I didn&#x27;t apply enough or if I got a defective item. Also, I feel like my skin gets rubbed too much when I apply on face because it is \\&quot;hard\\&quot;. I could get more wrinkles by trying to apply it on my face than getting wrinkles from the sun. LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s slightly yellow due to beeswax, and smells like sunflower seed or whatever. Personally, I dislike the smell although it goes away after 1hour or maybe less. Not sure if I will break out. Although, if I&#x27;m going to a beach, I&#x27;d rather have acne than burn and get wrinkles. I think I may use shiseido&#x27;s  ultmiate sunscreen for face (ZnO 13% and TiO )if I want oil-free, non-breaking out product, and very water resistant sunscreen  for usage in beach or sports. That product is not as eco-friendly or organic, but provides better UVB protection, and similarly high UVA protection.</li>
    <li> I am so very, very pleased with this product. I was looking for the most natural sunscreen possible, and came across Raw Elements. I couldn&#x27;t believe the ingredient list! the ONLY active ingredient is Zinc Oxide and EVERY single other inactive ingredient is a completely natural product (mango butter, green tea, black tea, cocoa butter, etc ... ) Sounded too good to be true and based on some other reviews about the consistency, difficulty getting it out of the tube and difficulty rubbing it in - I had my doubts. (I was looking primarily for something I could wear on my face and use on my children) But I ordered the tube of eco+ as well as the eco+ stick. Incredible products! There was no issue AT ALL with getting it out of the tube and rubbed right in leaving NO trace of white residue. I suppose I could see that if the tube was in a cold room, you might need to warm it up a bit first, but ... seriously - who cares? I find that the stick was slightly more of a matte finish than the cream in the tube, but I liked the spreadability of the cream so much that I use that one on my face anyway. It leaves a little bit of a glisten on my face that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and is very subtle anyway and goes away after wearing for a few minutes. I guess if I HAD to choose, I prefer the cream slightly over the stick because it seems to go on a little easier, but I do like the stick as well and I like it also for ease of portability and to have on hand in my purse, etc. I will 100% be ordering again when I am out of this product. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I learned about this sunscreen from a surf guide in Panama who ordered it  online and had it shipped into Panama from the states. It is probably the best eco friendly sunscreen on the market right now. It goes on thick and leaves a solid coat that will protect you from the sun. A lot of other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used sting my eyes once I get out in the water but this one never has. It&#x27;s so thick that I have to scrub it off when I get out of the shower. It&#x27;s probably not good if you have acne prone skin because it is heavy, but if you need something to protect you in the water this stuff is great.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product enough to review for product effectiveness. However I was blown away at how small the container was when I opened it. I guess I assumed (bad) that it would be the size of a standard deodorant container which is similar. It&#x27;s not! See pick below. If it was just for the face I would understand! A little deceiving I feel.</li>
    <li> Excellent, just like the sunscreen. Convenient for face, nose, and lips application.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Love that is Non-GMO and no oxybenzone in it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunscreen for my face. Works great. You can put in on really thick so that you have a nice layer of sunscreen that will last pretty much all day. I would put it on really thick around my eyes. Just got back from Cabo and my face isn&#x27;t even tan! I would apply first thing in the morning (6am) and surf for 3 or 4 hours and still have my face white from the sunscreen. Usually I would just retouch my nose and then jump back out in the water from 11-1. This isn&#x27;t a daily sunscreen though this is for sports or long days playing at the beach. It&#x27;s heavy duty and you need a towel to wipe it off. My only complaint is the price.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen as it is easy to apply and a safe, chemical free option that really works!! Wonderful , easy transaction.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this was on a four  hour bike ride and returned with absolutely no evidence of sunburn!  However, what I didn&#x27;t realize was that it does not soak in, at all, so for the whole day I had ghostly white stubble face. Yes, it shimmers a nice, bright, purplely white color on facial hair. I hadn&#x27;t shaven in two or three days, so it was especially bad and quite embarrassing. The second time I used it, I made sure to shave, but still applied too much. This time I found that sweat would bead up all over my face, leaving me to wonder if the sunblock, being so thick, actually increased perspiration. Not one to give up easily, on the third application I applied it on select, non-stubble areas and rubbed it around with my hands. There was still a little bit of a white hue to my face, but not terribly excessive. For the other two times, I just put it on straight from the stick, as intended, but that just seems to be too thick of a coating.  I&#x27;m tempted to buy the tinted version, which will most likely result in an orange or bronze face--is that better? I don&#x27;t know. My other favorite sunblock is Bullfrog, but it doesn&#x27;t last all day like this stuff. I should say that I am Caucasian with a slightly tan skin tone.</li>
    <li> This was thick, chunky and hard to apply.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen to use with toddlers and children.  I also bought the Raw Elements lotion.  I start with that, then use this stick for touch-ups.  It is thick - but I like that.  That way, you know EXACTLY where you are putting the sunscreen, so you don&#x27;t miss any part of your babies skin.  Plus - it is natural and doesn&#x27;t contain a ton of chemicals.  My only caveat is that you need to be diligent about applying it according to the directions.  If you do that, you&#x27;ll be in good shape with no sunburns!</li>
    <li> I was a lifeguard in San Diego for 4 years. I have tried every sunscreen and sunblock there is. Nothing lasts like this stuff. I sweat a lot and would work up to 10 hour shifts on humid, scorching SD beaches. Regular sunscreen is almost useless in this scenario, so I resort to sticks like this one for my face. There are plenty out there, but often have ingredients that actually screen our reefs and marine life, so I avoid those. Raw Elements is Non-GMO certified organic and sticks to my skin like no other. It also doesn&#x27;t sting my pores as I sweat. If you complain about this stuff being sticky, you are complaining about the product working TOO well. Come on now. BOTTOM LINE: Buy this is if you are doing rigorous activity on or in the ocean, or you want serious coverage from the sun for hours.</li>
