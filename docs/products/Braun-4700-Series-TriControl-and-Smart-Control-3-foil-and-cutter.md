    <li> Replacing the cutting block and old foil, my Braun shaver is just like new.  I had bought a replacement shaver(not Braun) and it did not shave very well.  I decided to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; my nine year old Braun with the new parts and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> These replacement parts were just what I needed to restore my favorite razor to like-new condition.  Braun makes a great product.</li>
    <li> We have an older model shaver but we love it and was thrilled to get the refill heads. The shipping was fast and it was a perfect fit!!</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with the product sent to me. It was in perfect condition. The part was sent in a timely manner for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I doubted that I could replace the razor head and that it would function well, but I was happy to find myself wrong.  Replacing the razor made shaving faster and more comfortable, definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Why look all over town when you can find what you need on Amazon. It&#x27;s exactly what I needed and I didn&#x27;t have to wait in line or drive all over town to be told \\&quot;they are out of stock\\&quot;. Great blade refill. Great shaver.</li>
    <li> It works but I still get nipped and bleed even though I don&#x27;t press hard.  For the price the foil should be much stronger.</li>
    <li> I have had my Braun razor for 7 years and it is a great razor, just hard to find replacement blades.  These blades were a good price and shipped immediately.  Will buy them here from now on as I can&#x27;t find them anywhere in the stores.  Outer cover seemed a bit flimsy compared to the original, so I just replaced the blades and kept the original cover on the razor.</li>
    <li> It came undamaged and in exelent working order. If you need new blades this seller works well.</li>
    <li> looked everywhere for this blade,all were 24to$28,got lucky and found them on Amazon,for much better price. No hasell,never left the house,and a much better price ,thanks Amazon......................</li>
    <li> Product purchased delivers desired results.  No surprises and met the requirements as advertised.  I was satisfied with the price and did not know if I could find the replacements I was needing and thought that I would have to buy a new electric razor which I did not want to do.  I like the Braun 4702 model.</li>
    <li> Order was received even sooner than expected and was perfect for my razor. I have experienced the sharpness of that I had when the razor was new right out of the box.  The price was certainly better than any other listed on the Internet.  I clearly made the right choice.</li>
    <li> It Works 100% better than the newer razors and 110% better than the Remington electric razors do. longer life span for the heads.</li>
    <li> Nothing more I can say than how I described in the title. The foil is little too tight when you need to take it off to clean and stuff. I end up using a scissor or something with sharp edge to pry it open. But overall, works fine.</li>
    <li> Just as ordered, and easy to replace old and worn out cutters. No problem changing out the old parts as well.</li>
    <li> Braun makes high quality razors but the cost for the replacement parts is very high. Fortunately I was able to find my foil/cutter on Amazon for a somewhat more reasonable price</li>
    <li> No problems with order or product.  The foil head fit perfectly on my old shaver and has been working for several weeks.</li>
    <li> I specifically bought this item based on the featured picture and application notes. I wanted the original center bar parallel slot design [not the newer \\&quot;W\\&quot; shape middle bar]. If I knew they were going to send the newer Series 3 item, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered.  I could have bought what they sent at the local Target, Walmart, or AF BX.</li>
    <li> Interior plastic part for the foil was not properly manufactured in that part of it was not complete and broke when removing the foil for cleaning</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my husband&#x27;s shaver and he is very satisfied with it. It works excellently.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to others.</li>

    <li> This made my older shaver work like new, I will purchase this again when I need to replace it again.</li>
    <li> It was taking longer and longer to get a close shave. When I noticed missing teeth on the cutters and a hole in the screen I thought I&#x27;d try replacing them. Razor works like new now. Like night and day. Should have done it long ago.</li>
    <li> ... it&#x27;s working just great with my shaver Braun 4775, it&#x27;s gonna last for long time. I really recommend this product to anyone! Make sure it&#x27;s mach model of your Shaver before you order. Nice feeling well of shaving my every time!</li>
