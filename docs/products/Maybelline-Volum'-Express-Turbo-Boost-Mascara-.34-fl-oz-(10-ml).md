    <li> Mascara goes on thick and gooey.  It was difficult to keep from smudging even before it dried.  I will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product. I recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> Mascara is very light, wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for but if you&#x27;re going for a natural look it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick, dark black, and goopy. I love it. If you are careful you can really pile it on before it starts clumping. It&#x27;ll make you go wow. It lasts long without flaking too. It&#x27;s one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Great product for a very a good price outstanding&lt;br /&gt;I like it cause it brings out a great volume on eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara for the price.  Builds a nice, long, thick lash and is easy to apply.  I do use a lash curler before applying for extra &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> The water proof works 100% better but this also gives VOLUM!! Make such to read this is the washable one.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I recommend it very much. It really helps my eyelashes look longer and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(-Karla)</li>
    <li> Use it always and love it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite drugstore brand mascara. It lasts all day and gives great volume and length without clumping. I&#x27;ve tried plenty of other more expensive products.</li>
    <li> goes on well, last long and makes my lashes look even longer as well as thick---difficult to find in some stores, will buy some more</li>
    <li> This has been a great mascara I will buy this exact brand and color again, washes off easily and goes on great</li>
    <li> I tried this mascara based on other positive reviews. I won&#x27;t buy this again. It goes on sooooo thin, it&#x27;s basically not worth the trouble. I had watched an Oprah show when it was on tv awhile back. She mentioned her make-up artist combines 3 different mascaras to achieve a good look, which I have been following for several years. I tried this mascara on my lashes first, horrible. I tried it second, and still didn&#x27;t improve my lashes. I&#x27;ll use it up because I did make the purchase, but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Mabeline mascaras are the best I have tried compared to other brands.  If you have thin eyelashes and you are looking for volume and thickness, then this mascara is right for you.  It is very dark, provides volume, and it is easy to remove with warm water.  During removal, it did not take my lashes out like I have experienced with some other mascara brands.  The only negative thing about this mascara is that it does not provide length, but of course that is not what it is for. So if you are looking for both volume and length, you may want to pair this mascara with a lengthing mascara.  But I certainly recommend this one for those looking to add thickness to their eyelashes without the huge clumps.</li>
    <li> Not sure why Maybelline even made this mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t go on very well so does not fulfill its function.</li>
