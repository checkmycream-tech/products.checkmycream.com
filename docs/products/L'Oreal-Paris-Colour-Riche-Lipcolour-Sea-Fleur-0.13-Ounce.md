<li> as expected thank you</li>
<li> Have used Sea Fleur lipstick for many years and was disappointed when I discovered it was discontinued.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s a color I can wear year round.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, the tube I received from the vendor I purchased from was not pristine--the lipstick case was marked up a bit and not sealed, and the lipstick itself had been touched.</li>
<li> Needless to say I bought several!</li>
<li> Hard to find item as it has been discontinued by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
<li> Oh well, at least I can still get it on Amazon!</li>
<li> When I could no longer find it in the stores I was so disappointed.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed that Loreal would discontinue this color, sea fleur.  </li>

    <li> I was looking for another discontinued lipstick when I came across this one.  This is an extraordinary shade of fuchsia lipstick!  I&#x27;m surprised that L&#x27;Oreal chose to discontinue carrying it in retail stores.  Oh well, at least I can still get it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lip color at my Mom&#x27;s request because she liked it on someone and couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  My Mom is 89 years olds and still stylin&#x27;!!!!!  She really likes it.</li>

    <li> I am very disappointed that Loreal would discontinue this color, sea fleur.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and it matches everything I wear.  Perhaps, with a little pressure, they will bring it back to the stores.  I love this color, but I&#x27;m not willing to spend $30 online.</li>

    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued this color! Judging by all the reviews, it seems to be a big seller. I&#x27;ve worn it for 20 years -- it&#x27;s my favorite summer lipstick. It&#x27;s not summer without Sea Fleur! They used to have a matching nail polish too, but that&#x27;s been gone for years. I was so happy to find it on amazon! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> My favorite cannot find it in stock at any of the stores I shop at.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this shade for a very long time.  When it was unavailable, Amazon was my go-to place &amp; there it was!  Very happy.</li>
    <li> Love this Lipstick - It&#x27;s definitely my favorite and it&#x27;s a color I can wear year round.  Sea Fleur seems to go with just about everything I wear, Spring, Summer, Winter or Fall.</li>

    <li> This lipstick is the best! The color goes with everything and I get tons of compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing this same shade for about three years now, and I stock up every now and then because I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be able to find it at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lipstick also wears well, and keeps your lips soft.</li>

    <li> I have used this L&#x27;Oreal shade for over 15 years and have found nothing that compares to it.</li>
    <li> I love this color. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years. It&#x27;s moisturizing as well!  ❤️</li>
    <li> The color is great, but one of them 2 tubes I ordered does not turn to swivel up so all I get of that tube is a tiny bit.  I did not expect to receive a defective product.  Maybe the seller should have checked that before mailing it to me.</li>
