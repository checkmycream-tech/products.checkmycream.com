      <li>I HAVE NEVER HAD SO MANY COMPLEMENTS FROM THE LADIES</li>
      <li>she said &amp;#34; you smell tooooooo good to let got of &amp;#34; ;)</li>
      <li>It is a huge compliment producer, and makes you feel more confident.</li>
      <li>It is strong yet not drowning, and WILL catch people&#x27;s attention.</li>

      <li>Lasts long and smell great.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;d play it safe and order straight from Azzaro here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The cologne was shipped out quickly and well packaged.  </li>
      <li>great cologne for little $$</li>
      <li>This product is as good as I expected it to be.&lt;br</li>

      <li>You wouldn&#x27;t want to run the risk of getting a fake version of this awesome cologne.</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this brand through my brother and after falling in love with it, i told myself in definitely gonna buy this for my boyfriend for his bday</li>
      <li>This is my second bottle because I get so many compliments when I wear it.</li>
      <li>It sure beats the impulse of instantly having the item at the sales counter in the mall.</li>
      <li>Fresh, clean, distinctive, masculine, strong &amp; subtle, long lasting (more than 12 hours on my skin); authentic, sold &amp; shipped by Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Highly Recommended!</li>

      <li>He said it was better then some of these over priced colognes he&#x27;s purchased because the scent had a long lasting smell even when he would sweat he, always had someone ask him about his cologne.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s the exact cologne sole in the stores.</li>
      <li>The cost savings was definitely worth waiting for the arrival, although it didn&#x27;t take long at along.</li>
      <li>I ordered this from amazon cause the local stores wanted twice as much.</li>
      <li>It was a gift and so far no complaints</li>
      <li>As expected, well worth it.</li>

    <li> Excellent cologne .  . . it lasts for many days and smells great</li>
    <li> Women just LOVE this cologne!  Whenever I wear it, I get compliments from the ladies on how good I smell. It&#x27;s amazing, because I wear a lot  of other colognes and never get that kind of response. It&#x27;s a great product: inexpensive, lasts all day, and a large bottle for the price. But the best thing about it: it is a Chick Magnet! Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this spray EVERYONE always ask what do you have in dam that smells good I NevA tell women always want n hugs when I wear chrome</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother and he loved it! He said it was better then some of these over priced colognes he&#x27;s purchased because the scent had a long lasting smell even when he would sweat he, always had someone ask him about his cologne.So, this was given 5 stars for the quality!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle because I get so many compliments when I wear it. More so than my previous colognes.</li>
    <li> I find this scent HORRIBLE. I purchased this by mistake. Be ware &amp;#34;Chrome Legend&amp;#34; is NOTHING like &amp;#34;Chrome&amp;#34;. I love the Chrone scent but HATE the Chrone Legend scent.</li>
    <li> This Smell so good great cologne .</li>
    <li> nothing compare to the Chrome Legend I bought in Paris.Not a good quality.don&#x27;t like it all. Unfortunately i bought two and I don&#x27;t want to return it so I keep them and order another Eau de Toilette from Paris.</li>
    <li> Best cologne ever! Everywhere I go people ask me what I got on and they love it! Def recommended!</li>
    <li> This product is as good as I expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping:&lt;br /&gt;The shipping came neat and well protected. The colgne comes in a fitted ziplock baggy inside the box, and is surrounded by air pockets in the shipping box. You definetly don&#x27;t have to worry about anything breaking during the shipping process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product:&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product. The cologne is relatively cheap in price, yet very satisfying. The glass container was larger than I expected and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get months upon months of use out of the 4.2 ounce container. Now onto the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This colgne smells prodigious. It is strong yet not drowning, and WILL catch people&#x27;s attention. It is a huge compliment producer, and makes you feel more confident. The scent lasts for several hours, practically all day. Also, you don&#x27;t really have to worry about a friend wearing the same thing, because this cologne is not extremely popular. You&#x27;ll probably never run into anyone else wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;This product deserves five stars hands down. It&#x27;s combined scent, longevity, and compliment attribute makes this cologne a must have in my opinion. At $28.99 you cant really miss with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you do not buy this from third party sellers. I&#x27;d play it safe and order straight from Azzaro here on Amazon. You wouldn&#x27;t want to run the risk of getting a fake version of this awesome cologne.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I purchased it for my husband and I absolutely love smelling him now!  Great value for what you get.</li>
    <li> I HAVE NEVER HAD SO MANY COMPLEMENTS FROM THE LADIES AS I DO WHEN I PUT ON AZZARO.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from amazon cause the local stores wanted twice as much.I didn&#x27;t think it would be the same product as i thought it would be an off brand but it&#x27;s the exact cologne sole in the stores.Lasts long and smell great.</li>
    <li> My husband loves nice cologne and this is one of his favorites. Nice scent!</li>
    <li> Great scent for my teenage son.</li>
    <li> Fresh, clean, distinctive, masculine, strong &amp; subtle, long lasting (more than 12 hours on my skin); authentic, sold &amp; shipped by Amazon.  For casual wearing &amp; outdoor activities I use this Chrome Legend.  Buy it, and you will like it.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase. It came as if I had bought it from the local department store, packaging and all. The cost savings was definitely worth waiting for the arrival, although it didn&#x27;t take long at along. It sure beats the impulse of instantly having the item at the sales counter in the mall. Saving money on an item gives it a great review!</li>
