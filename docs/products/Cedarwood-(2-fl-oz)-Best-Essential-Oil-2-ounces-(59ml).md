      <li>It smells so good.</li>
      <li>It is a good way not to overuse your oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>The cedarwood smell is very rich and soothing.</li>

      <li>Strong scent - just what I wanted for my diffuser.</li>
      <li>I received this as free gift in the mail.</li>

      <li>I received this essential oil along with 9 others for free to review.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping, I didn&#x27;t like the smell too much from the bottle</li>
      <li>It  really does not smell like cedar.</li>
      <li>since using it for the past couple of weeks ive noticed a huge difference in the amount of dandruff I have and how strong my hair feels.</li>
      <li>and I was pleasantly surprised by the really soothing smell.</li>
      <li>I use a couple drops every 3 nights in with my normal conditioner.</li>
      <li>I am a firm believer in holistic medicine and avoid over the counter medicines as they have too many chemicals in their products.  </li>

    <li> I know its embarrassing to admit but I have dandruff badly!! I mean its so bad that if I scratch in public it starts to snow. needless to say I found an amazing and useful cure for this horrible condition I have. I got the opportunity to try the cedarwood oil for free and all I had to do was try it out and review it so after looking up good uses and realizing that it just might help me I agreed to try it. I use a couple drops every 3 nights in with my normal conditioner. I mix the oil and conditioner and later in my hair, leave it for about 5 minutes (long enough for me to shave and bathe) and rinse. since using it for the past couple of weeks ive noticed a huge difference in the amount of dandruff I have and how strong my hair feels.

    <li> I have given this 4 stars as the bottle does not state where this was manufactured.&lt;br /&gt;This oil comes with a bulb type dropper that has measurements on it but wish it came with a regular screw on eye dropper.  I plan on using this oil with a diffuser for anxiety.  I am a firm believer in holistic medicine and avoid over the counter medicines as they have too many chemicals in their products.  I have listed some uses for Cedarwood Oil but you can find more by searching the web.  Never use this internally and always read safety precautions when using any oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Acne&lt;br /&gt;Add one drop of cedarwood essential oil to your daily routine (consider using within a moisturizer, cleanser, or by itself as need).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anxiety&lt;br /&gt;Inhale straight from the bottle, diffuse through the room, or apply a drop over the brow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asthma&lt;br /&gt;Massage 1-2 drops into the chest and throat daily or as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bladder Infection&lt;br /&gt;Massage 1-2 drops over the kidneys and bladder 2-3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calming&lt;br /&gt;Place 1 drop in your hands, rub together, then cup over the nose and mouth and breathe naturally for several minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Connection (in relationships)&lt;br /&gt;Use over the heart center or inhale as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congestion&lt;br /&gt;Cedarwood essential oil benefits our respiratory system greatly. Apply 1-2 drops over the area of concern or massage into the reflex points of the feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cough&lt;br /&gt;Apply 1-2 drops over the throat and chest several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dandruff&lt;br /&gt;Massage 1-2 drops into scalp; consider using coconut oil as a carrier to maximize its antifungal and moisturizing benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grounding&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite cedarwood essential oil benefits.

I would definitely recommend this Cedarwood Essential Oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> It  really does not smell like cedar.It has a chemical smell</li>
    <li> I received this oil for free to review. I love it. It smells so good. I have asthma so its hard for me to be around certain scents. So needless to say i am thrilled i found essential oils. They are strong yet not choke and gag you strength. I am able to put the oil in a warmer and or my humidifier and my whole house is delightful for hours on end. I find new uses evryday and look forward to them.</li>
    <li> I received this as free gift in the mail. I couldn&#x27;t wait to open it to smell it! I knew I&#x27;d be smelling &amp;#34;Cedar&amp;#34; Wood! And sure enough it did. I like the smell of Cedar! I can&#x27;t wait to figure out how to use this one too!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Jfaris</li>
    <li> Woodsy and a great addition to my home made shampoo</li>
    <li> Weak....for those looking for a diluted oil, this is for you.  Not impressed with this brand and will not buy again.  Tried the lavendar and bergamont.... Didn&#x27;t want to pay doterra prices.  Hoping to find a better option.</li>
    <li> Another fantastic Sun Organic oil. The cedarwood smell is very rich and soothing. One thing I think is great about these oils is the dropper that comes with them so you can count drops as you use it. It is a good way not to overuse your oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product as a company promotion and have either received a discount or got it free in return for my unbiased opinion and review.*</li>
