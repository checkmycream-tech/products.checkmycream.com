      <li>This is the best adult Bubble bath around.</li>
      <li>We have been using this product for many years and it seems the \\&quot;new\\&quot; product is not as good as the original formula.  </li>

      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love Badedas, and have used it as a soothing bubble bath for decades.  </li>

      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I was pleased to find it at Amazon</li>
      <li>I have used this product for 20 years or more.  </li>
      <li>guess I should have read more about</li>
      <li>It is my husbands favorite product to use for soaking.</li>

      <li>Have doubts it&#x27;s authentic</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite body wash of all time.</li>
      <li>BADEDAS, a fine product I have used for 50 years, and which has no doubt been available for 100 years, has been</li>
      <li>I grew up with this wonderful product and continued using it into adulthood as a little bit of luxury and reminder of home, happy to pay extra for a quality bath gel.</li>
      <li>I throughly enjoy Badedas.</li>
      <li>For some reason I thought perhaps it was available online after a conversation with a friend, and it was.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s like the original, but it will do.</li>

      <li>I always try to use this product to make my bathing experience special.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite bath gel.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s beyond me how Unilever could make the decision to buy a popular brand and then completely reengineer it to the point where it is unrecognizable, except for the packaging.</li>
      <li>This purchased Badedas is not the original Classic version which I have enjoyed for over 40 years.</li>
      <li>Have been using Badedas for a very long time in the Old Country (Germany), and it&#x27;s the best Bathoil on the market.</li>
      <li>It lathers so well with just a little, and it makes the whole room smell wonderful for a while after.</li>
      <li>Got here quickly and</li>
      <li>We cannot live without this !!!!</li>
      <li>Love smell, like being in outdoors, not prissy smell, like being in pine trees and forest.</li>
      <li>Beautiful emerald green color.</li>
      <li>I struggle to find a decent bubble bath and this one checks all the boxes: lots of bubbles that last, lovely smell and cost effective</li>
      <li>First of all, it isn&#x27;t the original Badedas.  </li>
      <li>Smells wonderful but hard to get out of bottle as opening large and not user</li>
      <li>I have been using Badedas for over 40 yrs,it is excellent for tired ,weary, worn bodies.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the ultimate in &amp;#34;aroma therapy&amp;#34; to use the trendy language.  </li>
      <li>The original color was bright forest green.</li>
      <li>Oh, if only I could get the REAL original Badedas.</li>
      <li>The product is nothing like the original classic Badedas bath gel.</li>
      <li>thought I was purchasing the ORIGINAL BADEDAS, instead, I got the NEW IMPROVED JUNK.</li>
      <li>It still is priced higher than in Germany, where it&#x27;s a normal kind of bath product, but it&#x27;s certainly reasonable compared to the department stores and lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you&#x27;re new to this product, there&#x27;s something magic about the aroma of this product.  </li>
      <li>A little goes a long way and the smell is magnificent!</li>
      <li>first used it in Europe.</li>
      <li>At first I thought the pack I&#x27;d purchased was a knock-off.</li>
      <li>It is not the same exact formula as before but it is better than no Badedas at all.</li>
      <li>It will waft through the air from you hot shower or bath</li>

    <li> BADEDAS, a fine product I have used for 50 years, and which has no doubt been available for 100 years, has been&lt;br /&gt;turned in to TOTAL JUNK!&lt;br /&gt;A pleasant pine color and pine scent now STINKS and looks like DIRTY DISHWATER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it away, would not use it on a pet Skunk, much less a Dog!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was purchasing the ORIGINAL BADEDAS, instead, I got the NEW IMPROVED JUNK.</li>
    <li> Great product from Germany</li>
    <li> not the same as badedas usually is. weird color and not the same as a bottle that i already had</li>
    <li> This is the best adult Bubble bath around.</li>
    <li> Hard to find but a little goes a long way.  A bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> do not smell very strong</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product and it was shipped on time.</li>
    <li> I love Badedas, and have used it as a soothing bubble bath for decades.  It&#x27;s the ultimate in &amp;#34;aroma therapy&amp;#34; to use the trendy language.  I used to bring it back in the suitcase from frequent trips to Germany.  Then it began appearing at a highly inflated price in department stores.  To find it at Amazon is wonderful.  It still is priced higher than in Germany, where it&#x27;s a normal kind of bath product, but it&#x27;s certainly reasonable compared to the department stores and lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you&#x27;re new to this product, there&#x27;s something magic about the aroma of this product.  If you&#x27;ve never tried it, you owe yourself.  It will waft through the air from you hot shower or bath and I find it to be just wonderful.</li>
    <li> My husband  liked  it and  so do  I</li>
    <li> There is always something very decadent about soaking in a bathtub with badedas bath gel - I love the smell and somehow it seems to relax me beautifully.</li>
    <li> A delightfully refreshing bath and shower gel with notes of a verdant mossy forest stream.</li>
    <li> great body wash with a fragrance that smells clean.</li>
    <li> I have order Badedas Classic Original Vital Bad Bath Gel in the past. However, this product is NOT what it used to be. The smell is the same, but the quality is much worse. Very disappointing. Will not order again. Have doubts it&#x27;s authentic</li>
    <li> This purchased Badedas is not the original Classic version which I have enjoyed for over 40 years. The gel is now blueish green and very liquid, while the original version was yellow green and very thick gel form.&lt;br /&gt;For any future purchasers of this product, please be advised that you will be very disappointed. It was just too much trouble to return the 2 bottles I purchased, but I will never again buy this product.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best pine bath products on the market.  The price for 2 large bottles is terrific.</li>
    <li> Great gift, smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since 1991 and I know it is the best and most luxurious bath product ever to be invented.  The horse chestnut extract  really helps to soothe sore muscles. And the fragrance permeates the entire house.  It is my husbands favorite product to use for soaking. We cannot live without this !!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Badedas for over 40 yrs,it is excellent for tired ,weary, worn bodies. Soak in a hot Badedas bath and lay down for about anhour and you are good to go.</li>
    <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t brighten the whole house like it used to, just the shower, the color is not as intense as it used to be just a translucent green! Absolutely not the same product, very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Smells great! Arrived on time</li>
    <li> The best bubble bath ever had !</li>
    <li> Adding my vote of disappointment to the overwhelming number of recent negative reviews from people who knew the original. At first I thought the pack I&#x27;d purchased was a knock-off. But on scouring the internet I realized my bottle was indeed genuine, only it was made after Unilever bought Badedas. I grew up with this wonderful product and continued using it into adulthood as a little bit of luxury and reminder of home, happy to pay extra for a quality bath gel. But on acquiring the original company -- or the rights or whatever -- Unilever has utterly ruined this once great brand. A big part of the product&#x27;s charm was always its distinct scent, but the Unilever version smells cheap -- even off-putting. The feel isn&#x27;t the same, the suds aren&#x27;t as luxurious and the color is completely different. It&#x27;s beyond me how Unilever could make the decision to buy a popular brand and then completely reengineer it to the point where it is unrecognizable, except for the packaging. I&#x27;d rather see this new Badedas die a natural death than continue to be produced as a pale (putrescent) shadow of its former self. Actually, I&#x27;d really rather Unilever admit their mistake and bring back the old formula, but I can&#x27;t see that happening. If you knew and loved the original &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Badedas, save yourself the disappointment of buying this poor facsimile.</li>
    <li> This product was not the real Badedas unless Badedas changed their formula. I&#x27;ve been using this product a very long time.  This shipment did not smell or look like Badedas in the bathtub.</li>
    <li> So when I see:&lt;br /&gt;Badedas Classic Original Vital Bad Bath Gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is bath gel... not bubble bath.  guess I should have read more about it.&lt;br /&gt;So be careful, the description is slightly misleading.</li>
    <li> Best smelling cleaning bath gel.  I keep trying others and always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> When my children were young we lived, for a time, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Babedas was the addition to bath time for my boys and now, just to smell it brings back wonderful  memories</li>
    <li> Instead of the original Badedas, the shipment was the &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; formula per a stuck on label. It may have improved for the maker but not for the user. I would not have ordered if I had known about the &amp;#34;improvement&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s like the original, but it will do. The price was good.&lt;br /&gt;I first used it in Europe.</li>
    <li> Used this product while in Germany!  Great product.  Order item since returning to United States in 1982.  Love it!  Love smell, like being in outdoors, not prissy smell, like being in pine trees and forest.</li>
    <li> My mom loves these and they were a perfect gift for her! Can&#x27;t find in any stores which is why I buy online! Got here quickly and great price!</li>
    <li> Great smell, good product, the product you can trust.  I always try to use this product to make my bathing experience special.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the original Badedas. The original made the bath water very green and very fragrant with bubbles that lasted for the entire bath. The ones sold here are weakly fragrant, very pale and the bubbles disappear quickly. Oh, if only I could get the REAL original Badedas.</li>
    <li> My wife prefers bathing to showering.  She loves adding Badedas to her bathwater and I like how the bathroom smells.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Arrived very quickly and excellent price</li>
    <li> Great product. In fact I would like to re-place the very same order. Can you do that for me?&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks&lt;br /&gt;Richard Pini</li>
    <li> It is just as I remember from the first discovery in Switzerland several years ago.  After my bath or shower, the whole house smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> There is no other... first experienced this traveling to Israel in the early 80&#x27;s. Never forgot it and always wanted it. Nothing ever lived up to that smell... though God knows I tried. For some reason I thought perhaps it was available online after a conversation with a friend, and it was. I will be getting it on a regular basis now. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Smells like an exotic Irish Springs!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a recurring purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Found it to be the same as I had used when I lived in Germany. Happy with the product. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have used the Badedas for decades. This new formula is completely different. Different ingredients, smell, consistency and foam. Not better than cheaper alternatives.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the wonderful price offered through Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great! Was a gift for my mom and she loved it.</li>
    <li> The product I received is very disappointing.  When compared with the same &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; store-bought product I have used for at least fifteen years, this product has no scent; the colour is very different; and it lathers much less.  It does not have 2 of the colours in my usual product; and contains 3 ingredients plus 1 colour that are not in my store-bought product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all of my years of purchasing from this website I have had mostly excellent results. However, I was similarly disappointed when I purchased a bottle of Chanel No. 5 from this web store.  In the future I will buy these types of products from my local store.</li>
    <li> I recently buy the original vital bath gel I was very disappointed I  will not buy it again</li>
    <li> First of all, it isn&#x27;t the original Badedas.  The color, the smell, are all different.  No longer a good product.  I have used it for years.  This is the last time I will ever buy it.  I am very disappointed.  It is a much inferior product than it has been for the past 20 years..</li>
    <li> This product is not the normal formula.  It doesn&#x27;t smell the same and the color is different.  I have been using this product for 30 years and there is a difference.</li>
    <li> This is a shampoo and bubble bath made in Germany of extract of horse-chestnuts. Once you try it it becomes almost addictive! A wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 20 years or more.  I first bought it in Bermuda where I vacationed for 20 years.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body wash of all time. A little goes a long way and the smell is magnificent! It lathers so well with just a little, and it makes the whole room smell wonderful for a while after. It can also be added to the tub and used as a bubble bath. This is a great value from Amazon for the twin pack.</li>
    <li> Just try it one time......you will never buy bath gel at Wally World again!</li>
    <li> I used it in Germany many years ago and always liked it. The smell is invigorating. A little expensive but worth it</li>
    <li> I throughly enjoy Badedas. I struggle to find a decent bubble bath and this one checks all the boxes: lots of bubbles that last, lovely smell and cost effective (you only need a teaspoonful!).</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for many years and it seems the \\&quot;new\\&quot; product is not as good as the original formula.  It does not produce the foam as it use to. If they bring back the original product I will continue to purchase it, but for now I will use other products that provide the greater suds.</li>
    <li> I began using Badedas classic when I lived in Europe. The fragrance is long lasting with a fresh clean feeling over you body.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff, with the best scent! Seller delievered promptly.</li>
    <li> Have been using Badedas for a very long time in the Old Country (Germany), and it&#x27;s the best Bathoil on the market. Using only a very small amount, it foams a lot in the bathtub. It relaxes the body after a stressful day, giving a lot of rest afterwards. It&#x27;salso natural w/o any chemicals (I believe).</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is not the same exact formula as before but it is better than no Badedas at all. This seller is very nice to work with and has great communication and customer service skills. They bent over backwards to make me happy. I would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> My favorite for years!</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR 40 YEARS AND LOVE IT MORE NOW THAN EVER!!!  It refreshes and protects your skin for all day!</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite bath gel. I love the scent!</li>
    <li> Badedas - The bath gel is a great consistency and a cool, spicy scent. So refreshing! I was pleased to find it at Amazon</li>
    <li> I should have read the previous reviews before I ordered this. The product is nothing like the original classic Badedas bath gel. The original color was bright forest green. The &amp;#34;Improved&amp;#34; newer version is a pale blue and much thinner than the original. The smell is similar, but nothing even close to the nose filling horse chestnut odor of the original. The new product doesn&#x27;t foam as well either. I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I grew up with with this product and it is great. It was shipped to my house in less than a week. I was very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> The original formula was wonderful and they have now changed it.  Why can&#x27;t people leave things the way they were.  0nce I have finished using &amp;#34;the new&amp;#34; formula might have to find a differetn product.  Not sure I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted but the bottles were sticky and seemed like they had leaked before being packaged as no solution was in the envelope. Still great that I was able to find this stuff again :)</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful but hard to get out of bottle as opening large and not user&lt;br /&gt;  A friendly .</li>
    <li> Best shower gel ever! Smells great! Leaves skin so soft!</li>
    <li> One star means &amp;#34;I hate it&amp;#34;. It borders on false advertising! Like many other customers, I was UNPLEASENTLY surprised when this product was NOT the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; product it claimed to be. Even the color is not the same. It is a compleatly different product than what&#x27;s advertised. Please look elsewhere if you want the real thing. Cavet Emptor!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Badedas for a long time. This is a great product, excellent aroma and lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> Love it. Wonderful aroma - very calming aromatherapy. Beautiful emerald green color. Great value for the price.</li>
