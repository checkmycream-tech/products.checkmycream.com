<li> Call me cynical, but when plant products become whirled, extracted, remixed and \\&quot;improved\\&quot; through laboratory process, how is it the original pure plant product?</li>
<li> The Lily of the desert aloe vera 100% certified organic was purchased for me to use on my natural black hair.</li>

<li> Aloe gel as expected.</li>
<li> And this so-called gel is now very thin, just like juice, with a distinctly over-acid pungent taste.  </li>
<li> Not sure of my complaint is with Amazon or with the manufacturer but someone is responsible for misleading information.  </li>
<li> My health food store sells it, but I was too lazy to go cross town, so when purchasing something else, I add this to my cart</li>
<li> This has really helped my hair to stay moisturized in this cold winter weather.</li>
<li> Same awful taste but aside from the expected this product seems no different than any other ..</li>
<li> I did not have of my after-sun gel that I usually have</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a bad choice.</li>

    <li> Love this product. So good for my skin.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to make my own &#x27;healthy&#x27; moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Not sure of my complaint is with Amazon or with the manufacturer but someone is responsible for misleading information.  This product is billed as 100% organic aloe vera gel but it until you have it in your hands do you realize that it&#x27;s also got a carrageenan, potassium sorbate, and citric acid in it.  Why can&#x27;t they just be upfront about ingredients?</li>
    <li> I used to love Lily of the Desert aloe products, especially their aloe gel. Then, they \\&quot;improved\\&quot; the product.   Call me cynical, but when plant products become whirled, extracted, remixed and \\&quot;improved\\&quot; through laboratory process, how is it the original pure plant product? huh?  And this so-called gel is now very thin, just like juice, with a distinctly over-acid pungent taste.  So whatever they did in the laboratory to change this product also changed its taste, its texture and its essential aloe nature.   [[ASIN:B0009VNI40 Aloe Vera 100% Gel 12 oz Gel]]I plan to try Fruit of the Earth aloe gel now</li>
    <li> Not only is the Aloe Vera good for internal use...it is great for sunburns too. I did not have of my after-sun gel that I usually have so i grabbed this to use. It worked great. It was soothing and took the pain of the sunburn away quickly.</li>
    <li> The Lily of the desert aloe vera 100% certified organic was purchased for me to use on my natural black hair. I use it as a setting gel, but at the same time it nourishes my hair. I know it&#x27;s good for oral use also. Love it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  I use it mainly for my skin and its excellent:-) I am glad I discovered Lily Of The Desert Aloe!&lt;br /&gt;This aloe gel is perfect as is the name (the name is actually the second thing that drove me to this product,the first is understandably that its aloe vera gel and organic:-)</li>
    <li> I have been adding the aloe to my water I spray on my hair every morning. This has really helped my hair to stay moisturized in this cold winter weather.</li>
    <li> Ehhh! this was not what i expected, i thought it would be more jelly like instead it was very watery. I&#x27;d rather just buy the aloe and cut it out myself which is what i did. If you&#x27;re looking for aloe to drink this is for you but if you want it for your hair it&#x27;s a bad choice. It&#x27;s way too watery for you hair and it does not give my hair any kind of moisture.</li>
    <li> excellent product arrived on time</li>
    <li> Great for natural hair.  Great brand.</li>
    <li> I love this gel! My health food store sells it, but I was too lazy to go cross town, so when purchasing something else, I add this to my cart</li>

    <li> This is the PERFECT aloe vera gel!</li>
    <li> Its the only toner I can use that doesn&#x27;t break out my face. I also like to use it in my hair, after washing my hair I use it for my twist  out.</li>
    <li> I have locs and I use this product combined with, tea tree oil, aloe gel, castor oil, olive oil, jojoba oil and lavender as a leave in conditioner for my hair. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer as well as a conditioner for my hair.</li>
