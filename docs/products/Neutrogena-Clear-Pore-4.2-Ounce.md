      <li>It cleans the face perfectly.</li>
      <li>the best results***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>promise you, this is the best regimen.</li>
      <li>my face is perfectly clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I found this product and was ecstatic with the wonderful results.</li>
      <li>Excellent value for the product, Proactiv is great but too pricey.</li>
      <li>I use it with the Proactiv cleansing brush and get great results.</li>
      <li>So a scrub is great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was a good price</li>
      <li>EWasn&#x27;t expecting the product to be this good.</li>
      <li>But otherwise I found this to be really good at reducing redness, blackheads, and pimples.  </li>
      <li>My dermatologist recommended another neutrogena face cleanser about 10 years ago and I loved it.  </li>
      <li>Just be sure to follow up with a sunscreen!</li>
      <li>But my skin feels nice and refreshed after washing.</li>
      <li>I would use this in the shower and my face would have a nice glow after using this cleanser.</li>
      <li>I have bought every kind of acne cleanser imaginable.</li>
      <li>Nice smell too</li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t run out of those as fast), and it all works perfectly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of neutrogena cleansers and I&#x27;ve liked them all.  </li>
      <li>This by far is the best.</li>
      <li>I think benzoyl peroxide is a more effective ingredient.</li>
      <li>I have tried many face cleansers.</li>
      <li>This product is okay</li>
      <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t continue to use this on my face.</li>
      <li>I love neutrogena.</li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite face cleanser.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Everyone is different, but this stuff works great for me! :)</li>
      <li>:) I use Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer as my foundation/sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am in love with this product</li>
      <li>I have no complaints at all! :)</li>
      <li>I like this one the best because it feels like a deep clean</li>
      <li>It shipped and arrived quickly!</li>
      <li>My skin is now smooth and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve replaced my Proactiv Smooth Exfoliator wash for this one.</li>
      <li>Then afterwards I use the neutrogena visibly smooth sunscreen with vitamin e.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>would recommend this to anyone looking for an effective skin care product without paying for the way more expensive ( and equally effective) Proactiv!!</li>
      <li>Benzoyl Peroxide isn&#x27;t so friendly to my skin</li>
      <li>My face doesn&#x27;t even feel clean afterward.</li>
      <li>Leaves face feeling clean</li>
      <li>so I thought I wonder if I could use it to clean my bathroom tiles.</li>
      <li>In the evening, I use Maximum Oxy Clean 10% BP...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but really shouldn&#x27;t be used daily.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am a tan Mexican  and this stuff is good on my skin.</li>
      <li>One warning though is that the benzoyl peroxide can stain/bleach towels, so be sure to rinse all of the product off of the areas where the cleanser is applied to before drying your face, Overall though, it is a fantastic product that works well for people that struggle with acne or have had trouble finding a product that does a wonderful job in cleansing their face.</li>
      <li>She loves it and says that her face feels so fresh and clean after using it.</li>
      <li>It is slightly more potent than the Proactiv cleanser, so I actually prefer this product when my skin starts to flare up.</li>
      <li>I used to be a Proactiv user when I was a &amp;#34;kid&amp;#34; and on rare occasion</li>
      <li>It is the only acne cleanser out there with benzoyl peroxide as an ingredient, and this product is in a league of its own.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s here, this is the only one at some big box stores, and it doesn&#x27;t have a good smell!</li>
      <li>also haven&#x27;t found it bleaching my towels or shirts so it must rinse clean enough to really be mostly gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has just the right amount of benzoyl peroxide.</li>
      <li>For many years I used different Neutrogena face cleansers.  </li>
      <li>From clean and clear sacylic acid based products to Proactiv.</li>
      <li>It used to be easy to pick up a big box store brand one, and be on about my business.</li>
      <li>This is a great cleanser because it penetrates deep down into the pores of your skin.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product to have something a little more powerful than Salicylic Acid in my skin care regimen.  </li>
      <li>and it hasn&#x27;t really made any difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>I also follow up with the alcohol free toner before applying my topical medication.  </li>
      <li>Thank you for fast shipment.</li>
      <li>I have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The scrub&#x27;s main ingredient is Benzoyl Peroxide.  </li>
      <li>Kind of hard to rinse off</li>
      <li>Trying many products with salicylic acid that either did nothing for my skin or dried it out</li>
      <li>Havent had a major or mild breakout for 3 months mainly cus of the 120 mL of topical erythromicyn and pills i have took.</li>
      <li>am not sure what more to say.</li>
      <li>The scrub is so thick that it was more like lotion.</li>
      <li>be switching back to a combo of the Kiehl&#x27;s Facial Fuel Energizing Face Wash, and the Neutrogena Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Scrub.</li>
      <li>It lathers really easily, so barely any product is needed with each use, and there are microbeads that scrub away dead skin, leaving your face soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>This Neutrogena scrub has an even higher percentage than the more expensive Proactiv!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I expected this to happen as this is a little more intense a treatment than standard skin products.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended if you have stubborn, inflamed acne and don&#x27;t want to deal with/pay the extra $$$ for Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Clear pore seems to be a gentle enough scrub to use daily for my oily skin.  </li>
      <li>This scrub in the morning with the weekly Clear Pore Daily Mask/Cleanser worked wonders.</li>
      <li>For months I tried different brands to clear up my acne.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a solid covering froth, a small amount of scrub (beads or some grit of some sort) and rinses clean.</li>
      <li>I use Proactiv (I know, not cheap) green tea moisturizer....and love it.</li>
      <li>First time I used it so the area beneath my eyes swelled a little.</li>
      <li>first use of the product,  I noticed a slight burning sensation, but nothing too strong or really uncomfortable at all.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Benzoyl Peroxide isn&#x27;t so friendly to my skin so it made my acne come back. But my skin feels nice and refreshed after washing. Nice smell too</li>
    <li> I have finally found a scrub that works for my skin....My skin is now smooth and no  blackheads or unecessary bumps appear . I am in love with this product</li>
    <li> Well what can I say except it dyed my hair and eyebrows and then the washcloth I used to wipe my face. I was not happy that i had spent all that money and would have to throw it away so I thought I wonder if I could use it to clean my bathroom tiles. Guess what. It worked. They were spotless. So glad I didn&#x27;t continue to use this on my face. If it could take all the dark spots off my tile, who knows what it was doing to my skin. TERRIBLE STUFF DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> This product is okay, It arrived on time and everything. The scrub is so thick that it was more like lotion. Kind of hard to rinse off and it hasn&#x27;t really made any difference in my skin. My face doesn&#x27;t even feel clean afterward. i usually rewash it with another product.</li>
    <li> I love neutrogena. I am a tan Mexican  and this stuff is good on my skin. First time I used it so the area beneath my eyes swelled a little. But it went away in 5 to 10 minutes. Felt my skin smoother and after 2 and a half minutes of cleansing. I used to have a lot if acne till I went on topical erythromicyn and doxy hyclate pills. I will write another review later to see if this keeps acne away. Havent had a major or mild breakout for 3 months mainly cus of the 120 mL of topical erythromicyn and pills i have took. But i just went off the liquid and I havent been on pills since late October 2014. Will write another later.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to have something a little more powerful than Salicylic Acid in my skin care regimen.  The scrub&#x27;s main ingredient is Benzoyl Peroxide.  After a little research, I found that this is the same ingredient in &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; acne products such as Proactiv! This Neutrogena scrub has an even higher percentage than the more expensive Proactiv!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first use of the product,  I noticed a slight burning sensation, but nothing too strong or really uncomfortable at all.  I expected this to happen as this is a little more intense a treatment than standard skin products.  You do have to remember to not let this get in your hair at all, as it is a peroxide and can bleach it.  But otherwise I found this to be really good at reducing redness, blackheads, and pimples.  If you have sensitive skin,  you may need to not use it as often because it is a little intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for an effective skin care product without paying for the way more expensive ( and equally effective) Proactiv!!</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne for a few years. Trying many products with salicylic acid that either did nothing for my skin or dried it out so I was peeling like a lizard (no kidding!), I found this product and was ecstatic with the wonderful results. It is the only acne cleanser out there with benzoyl peroxide as an ingredient, and this product is in a league of its own. It lathers really easily, so barely any product is needed with each use, and there are microbeads that scrub away dead skin, leaving your face soft and smooth. I would use this in the shower and my face would have a nice glow after using this cleanser. One warning though is that the benzoyl peroxide can stain/bleach towels, so be sure to rinse all of the product off of the areas where the cleanser is applied to before drying your face, Overall though, it is a fantastic product that works well for people that struggle with acne or have had trouble finding a product that does a wonderful job in cleansing their face.</li>
    <li> It cleans, and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a good price and I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what more to say.</li>
    <li> I have tried many face cleansers. This by far is the best. It has just the right amount of benzoyl peroxide. I rotate it with the Cetaphil face wash. It might be too drying if you use it everyday (depending on whether you have oily or dry skin.)</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this scrub along with my acne prescriptions. I&#x27;ve used a lot of other scrubs, usually with 2% salicylic acid, and they did nothing for my skin (which is super oily and prone to acne). I think benzoyl peroxide is a more effective ingredient. If only I could find it at my drug store so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy it online!</li>
    <li> I have bought every kind of acne cleanser imaginable. From clean and clear sacylic acid based products to Proactiv. I have had acne for over 11 years. I finally decided that I&#x27;m going to try the store BP since its so much cheaper than these expensive brands (Proactiv)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely oily skin. So a scrub is great. This scrub in the morning with the weekly Clear Pore Daily Mask/Cleanser worked wonders. In the evening, I use Maximum Oxy Clean 10% BP...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get to a dermatologist, I suggest getting Clindamycin Phosphate Lotion and Retin A .01%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this combined....my face is perfectly clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning I use this scrub, following the clindamycin phosphate lotion. Then afterwards I use the neutrogena visibly smooth sunscreen with vitamin e.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the evening I use Oxy face wash followed by the Retin A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promise you, this is the best regimen. Even alone, this scrub can do wonders on your face. I absolutely love this product. It got rid of all my acne. If you buy this, definitely buy their sun screen with vitamin e and the mask version of it.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended another neutrogena face cleanser about 10 years ago and I loved it.  Since the. I&#x27;ve tried many of neutrogena cleansers and I&#x27;ve liked them all.  I like this one the best because it feels like a deep clean an isn&#x27;t harsh on my skin at all.  I have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Leaves face feeling clean</li>
    <li> I used to be a Proactiv user when I was a &amp;#34;kid&amp;#34; and on rare occasion that I get a break out, the benzoyl peroxide options always did the trick for me.  It used to be easy to pick up a big box store brand one, and be on about my business. These days, this is the ONLY benzoyl peroxide option I could find at the big box store. So: I wanted to review it and let you know it works, it&#x27;s here, this is the only one at some big box stores, and it doesn&#x27;t have a good smell! It&#x27;s not as bad as OXY 10, but it&#x27;s not that nice either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a solid covering froth, a small amount of scrub (beads or some grit of some sort) and rinses clean. It holds in place and doesn&#x27;t run in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also haven&#x27;t found it bleaching my towels or shirts so it must rinse clean enough to really be mostly gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it works, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m reviewing it. 4 stars instead of 5 because of the smell.</li>
    <li> This wash was purchased for my wife. She loves it and says that her face feels so fresh and clean after using it. Thank you for fast shipment.</li>
    <li> For many years I used different Neutrogena face cleansers.  A friend of mine advised me to try Dermalogica for my acne.  I bought the travel size just to try them out, and my face just broke out.  For months I tried different brands to clear up my acne.  After no success, I went to the dermatologist to get a medicated topical gel and I went back to Neutrogena as my basic cleanser.  Clear pore seems to be a gentle enough scrub to use daily for my oily skin.  I also follow up with the alcohol free toner before applying my topical medication.  Just goes to show, you don&#x27;t have to pay an expensive price for facial cleansers to get clean skin.</li>
    <li> I am 25 years old and still deal with the occasional \\&quot;stress knots\\&quot;, which are deep, painful and rather large. I usually stick to Proactiv, but I needed something to get me by until I got my order shipped. This is a great cleanser because it penetrates deep down into the pores of your skin. I use it with the Proactiv cleansing brush and get great results. I follow it up with the Proactiv toner and repairing lotion (I don&#x27;t run out of those as fast), and it all works perfectly. It is slightly more potent than the Proactiv cleanser, so I actually prefer this product when my skin starts to flare up. Highly recommended if you have stubborn, inflamed acne and don&#x27;t want to deal with/pay the extra $$$ for Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ***You must use a toner and skin repair treatment in conjunction with this cleanser if you want the best results***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For dryness: I use Proactiv (I know, not cheap) green tea moisturizer....and love it. After the 3 steps, I just apply it and my skin is refreshed without that oily residue I get with other moisturizers. Just be sure to follow up with a sunscreen! :) I use Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer as my foundation/sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different, but this stuff works great for me! :)</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite face cleanser. It shipped and arrived quickly! I have no complaints at all! :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but really shouldn&#x27;t be used daily.&lt;br /&gt;It is really harsh on my nose and the skin below my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Will be switching back to a combo of the Kiehl&#x27;s Facial Fuel Energizing Face Wash, and the Neutrogena Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Scrub.</li>
    <li> EWasn&#x27;t expecting the product to be this good. It cleans the face perfectly. I would recommand you to buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve replaced my Proactiv Smooth Exfoliator wash for this one. Excellent value for the product, Proactiv is great but too pricey. Thank god!</li>
