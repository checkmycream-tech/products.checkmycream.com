### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best quality!!!!!</li>
      <li>Great price!!!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;While it&#x27;s not a replacement for a good wash and blowout, it does the best as I&#x27;ve seen</li>
      <li>OMG, this stuff is an AMAZING volume player!</li>
      <li>I loved it.</li>
      <li>which was another reason I loved it</li>
      <li>and I love them both!  </li>
      <li>Immediately after applying the greasy look and feel of my hair was gone and it smelled really nice (like a high-end hairspray).</li>
      <li>(not that it mattered a lot, since it wasn&#x27;t my own</li>
      <li>For someone with fine, smooth hair I thought this could be great</li>
      <li>stuff smells just like your favorite Pantene.</li>
      <li>and you want more volume and texture in your hair</li>
      <li>However, if you want a hairspray that also freshens up the look of your hair  and reduces oiliness you&#x27;ll probably love this.</li>
      <li>and I love that one.  </li>
      <li>I may give it one more try</li>
      <li>Smelled great and was a good dry shampoo but not one, BOTH cans malfunctioned 1/2 way through using the can to where nothing would come out.</li>
      <li>but I was able to easily brush it out.</li>
      <li>this is a perfect dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>This product would be AMAZING if it would spray after the first use!</li>
      <li>It makes a huge difference for me</li>
      <li>I made the mistake of trying a free sample of this product.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a very clean, fresh scent.</li>
      <li>BUT it smelled like alcohol and it doesn&#x27;t clean my hair like Dove.</li>
      <li>My hair was shiny and clean looking though.</li>
      <li>The smell was great and actually left my hair looking clean and fresh, but it will not spray beyond the first use.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length very straight, fine, oily hair.</li>
      <li>Clean and fresh without smelling like food.</li>
      <li>day\\&quot; when I needed to get out the door quickly.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried using it by itself my hair did look okay, but had a very strong &amp;#34;hairspray&amp;#34; type smell that I literally smelled for the entire day.</li>
      <li>That was surprising, as often you get a duller sheen using dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>It barely absorbs any oil and makes me feel like I need to wash my hair more than I did before I used it.</li>
      <li>I usually put it in before bed and its great in the morning.  </li>
      <li>When I first sprayed it on I was pleasantly surprised by the light, fresh scent.</li>
      <li>love the product but after only use it stopped working</li>
      <li>So I loved this product on the first try, even though my hair felt stiff and plastic-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very straight, &amp;#34;lifeless&amp;#34;, fine hair that only lasts 1 day without getting oily after washing.</li>
      <li>I only bought this because pantene I have been happy with other Pantene products.  </li>
      <li>This dry shampoo is more like a hairspray if you ask me.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried too many dry shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I also noticed that my hair didn&#x27;t want to stay straight, instead it kept this wavy bed head look</li>
      <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It gets super dry and can get real oily after 2days.</li>
      <li>When I use this product it still looks fresh on the second day.  </li>
      <li>Of course the hairspray smell was not nearly as bad because I used less, but my hair was still extra knotty and full of tangles when I tried to brush it the next morning before showering... just like hairspray.</li>
      <li>For this reason I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone with thick curly/wavy hair unless you want more volume and thickness.</li>
      <li>Other reviewers make mention of a &amp;#34;clean, fresh scent&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s my only complaint, otherwise I loved this dry</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m mixed African American and Mexican, so like many generic hair care products I&#x27;ll chalk this up to once again made for not me.</li>
      <li>There was more of a white color than other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>The only way I can imagine the scent coming across as &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; is if you normally dump a gallon of hairspray on your head before walking out the door in the morning.</li>
      <li>, the pricier dry shampoos (Klorane, etc) are what really works for me, but I am always on the lookout for a cheaper alternative.</li>
      <li>But, if you have really flat thin hair like myself, buy as many as you can!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several and this one, despite my hopes, is near the bottom of the list.  </li>
      <li>about 6 times (my hair is straight and oily, so I wash it every other day), but it is STILL on my hair, making it stiff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does give volume as well as texturizes hair, which was a plus for me because it&#x27;s hard for my hair to retain volume and keep that full look.</li>
      <li>This gives a nice amount of volume without any weird dry texture or powdery look.  </li>

<li> My hair immediately went from smelling awful to smelling fresh.</li>
<li> This stuff arguably made my hair worse than leaving it alone.</li>
<li> This dry shampoo is terrible.  </li>
<li> get my fingers through, can&#x27;t get a brush through and my hair feels dirty like I&#x27;ve been in a sandstorm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My hair felt dirty afterwards.  </li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
<li> (I hate smelling like furniture polish)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This dry shampoo leaves hair feeling sticky, tangled (even after brushing, which takes forever with this product), and stiff. I would never recommend this product to a friend. It barely absorbs any oil and makes me feel like I need to wash my hair more than I did before I used it.</li>
    <li> This product would be AMAZING if it would spray after the first use! I loved it. The smell was great and actually left my hair looking clean and fresh, but it will not spray beyond the first use.</li>
    <li> I bought this locally because all the other options I wanted were already out of stock. I just wanted to give it a dry. I do like the scent, it&#x27;s a very clean, fresh scent. My hair is wavy-curly, dark, and thick. It gets super dry and can get real oily after 2days. After applying the spray (with straightened hair) it felt refreshing-better than tresemme, just for the touch ups. But after a couple days of not washing-kind of oily... It gets stiff and a little bit sticky. Since my hair is already thick, there&#x27;s not too much of a stiff difference. But overall, it&#x27;s alright. I haven&#x27;t tried too many dry shampoo&#x27;s. If you&#x27;re looking for one, try searching reviews of different kinds. Id only buy this again if it was my 2nd to last resort (last is tresemme).</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo is more like a hairspray if you ask me. I immediately want to wash my hair after using this product. It makes my hair very stiff (like I just sprayed a ton of hairspray in it) and I can&#x27;t even brush my hair after. Definitely will not be buying again and will not recommend..</li>
    <li> I bought this locally, not on Amazon. I have shoulder length very straight, fine, oily hair. I like dry shampoo because I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair every day. I&#x27;ve tried several and this one, despite my hopes, is near the bottom of the list.  When I first sprayed it on I was pleasantly surprised by the light, fresh scent. It felt like hair spray going on which a lot of dry shampoos do so I wasn&#x27;t concerned. I left it on for a minute then rubbed it in with my fingers. My roots felt very stiff. I then brushed my hair and I had the most horrible static ever. My hair was flying around and crackling in the air. We&#x27;ve got hard wood and tile floors, absolutely no carpet, so I can only assume it was this product. I may give it one more try but if I get the same results, I&#x27;m pitching it. I only wish I&#x27;d kept the receipt so I could return it.</li>
    <li> Great price!!!!! Best quality!!!!!</li>
    <li> love the product but after only use it stopped working</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried two versions of the Pantene Dry Shampoo now and I love them both!  At this point it&#x27;s a must have for me.  If I forget to use it I notice my hair looks flat and stringy!  This gives a nice amount of volume without any weird dry texture or powdery look.  I typically wash my hair almost every day, but previously if I skipped a day it would start looking very oily. When I use this product it still looks fresh on the second day.  It makes a huge difference for me so I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length color treated hair and wash it every couple days. I often use dry shampoo to refresh my style on off days. Many of them, however give me a terribly itchy scalp and breakouts (Oscar Biandi was the worst)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on sale at my local big box (for a lot less than what it&#x27;s selling for on here)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, the pricier dry shampoos (Klorane, etc) are what really works for me, but I am always on the lookout for a cheaper alternative. I thought I had it with Suave, but I could not get over the lemon scent. (I hate smelling like furniture polish)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells just like your favorite Pantene. Clean and fresh without smelling like food. It goes on a bit wet/cold, which is strange, but I went with it. After a few moments, I did the &#x27;dip your head and rub it in thing&#x27; and then grabbed my boars bristle brush to brush it out, and it really did refresh my hair. I had absolutely no powdery residue, but my hair did have a little bit more of a stiff thickness to it. It wasn&#x27;t bad. My hair was shiny and clean looking though. That was surprising, as often you get a duller sheen using dry shampoo. It seemed to last throughout the day very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed it not coming out of my hair when I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s not a replacement for a good wash and blowout, it does the best as I&#x27;ve seen so I definitely will be using it from now on.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers make mention of a &amp;#34;clean, fresh scent&amp;#34;. The only way I can imagine the scent coming across as &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; is if you normally dump a gallon of hairspray on your head before walking out the door in the morning. The first time I tried using it by itself my hair did look okay, but had a very strong &amp;#34;hairspray&amp;#34; type smell that I literally smelled for the entire day. The second time I tried using with another dry shampoo spray. Of course the hairspray smell was not nearly as bad because I used less, but my hair was still extra knotty and full of tangles when I tried to brush it the next morning before showering... just like hairspray. Personally, dislike hairspray for everyday use because of the qualities mentioned above. However, if you want a hairspray that also freshens up the look of your hair  and reduces oiliness you&#x27;ll probably love this.</li>
    <li> OMG, this stuff is an AMAZING volume player! If you are looking for a reg dry shampoo, don&#x27;t bother. But, if you have really flat thin hair like myself, buy as many as you can!</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a local store and after a week it stopped working! I shake the can and it sounds like there is liquid in there and when I press the nozzle nothing comes out. I did drop it so maybe that was the cause? I&#x27;m purchasing a second can to see if it will happen again. That&#x27;s my only complaint, otherwise I loved this dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;For reference I have very straight, &amp;#34;lifeless&amp;#34;, fine hair that only lasts 1 day without getting oily after washing. Immediately after applying the greasy look and feel of my hair was gone and it smelled really nice (like a high-end hairspray). There was more of a white color than other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used but I was able to easily brush it out. It does give volume as well as texturizes hair, which was a plus for me because it&#x27;s hard for my hair to retain volume and keep that full look. For this reason I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone with thick curly/wavy hair unless you want more volume and thickness. I also noticed that my hair didn&#x27;t want to stay straight, instead it kept this wavy bed head look which was another reason I loved it but I can see why others wouldn&#x27;t like this. Overall if you want the shiny look and feel of unwashed hair gone and you want more volume and texture in your hair this is a perfect dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> Awful! Bought TWO cans and they both just stopped working. Smelled great and was a good dry shampoo but not one, BOTH cans malfunctioned 1/2 way through using the can to where nothing would come out. I found out that this has happened to a bunch of people.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of trying a free sample of this product. It does work--I sprayed it onto my scalp on a \\&quot;hairwashing day\\&quot; when I needed to get out the door quickly. My hair immediately went from smelling awful to smelling fresh. So I loved this product on the first try, even though my hair felt stiff and plastic-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then that evening, I found that shampooing twice won&#x27;t wash it off. That was almost 2 weeks ago. I have since washed my hair about 6 times (my hair is straight and oily, so I wash it every other day), but it is STILL on my hair, making it stiff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister&#x27;s wedding was last weekend, and this stuff made it impossible to style my hair. So, I ended up overdoing it with the curling iron, and burned my hair! Split ends everywhere now. I don&#x27;t blame this product for the burned hair, but trying to style my hair with this stuff on it ruined my hair for that event. (not that it mattered a lot, since it wasn&#x27;t my own wedding-- but my hair looked awful, still)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has gone away a little bit with each wash, but my hair is still obviously stiff. I not only do not recommend this product, but I can&#x27;t believe Pantene is selling something this bad. I&#x27;ve been a Pantene product user for 20-25 years, so how terrible this product is, is really surprising to me. In all fairness, it&#x27;s possible that I sprayed a little too much of it--but still, I would never have thought that something can stick to your hair this long!</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible. It made my hair feel like I had hairspray in it. It made it cruchy and flat I couldnt even run my fingers through it without them getting stuck. I would not recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> We usually buy Dove dry shampoo. We decided to buy Pantene, it&#x27;s a little cheaper. BUT it smelled like alcohol and it doesn&#x27;t clean my hair like Dove. My ha oh r is still greasy. We&#x27;re back to Dove!</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrendous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always taken a &amp;#34;less is more&amp;#34; approach to dry shampoo but I can&#x27;t even use a tiny spray for bangs without a brush getting stuck in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t get my fingers through, can&#x27;t get a brush through and my hair feels dirty like I&#x27;ve been in a sandstorm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m staying with Dove.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo is terrible.  It was heavy and dry on my hair.  I usually put it in before bed and its great in the morning.  This stuff is awful.  It was so stuck in my hair.  I had a hard time trying to brush through my hair.  My hair felt dirty afterwards.  I ended up having to get in the shower and wash it out.  Couldn&#x27;t leave it in there.  Even after shampooing and conditioning my hair feel so dry.  One use and I am through it in the garbage.  I have used baptist before and I love that one.  I only bought this because pantene I have been happy with other Pantene products.  Terrible terrible stuff!!</li>
    <li> This should be marketed as a hair volumizer rather than a dry shampoo.  For someone with fine, smooth hair I thought this could be great and it was for two uses.  The third time I tried to use it, the dispenser clogged.  I should have looked at the reviews closer before ordering as I now see others ran into the same problem.  Do not purchase this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff arguably made my hair worse than leaving it alone. It created this weirdly artificial not fresh smell and made my hair gross and sticky. I&#x27;m mixed African American and Mexican, so like many generic hair care products I&#x27;ll chalk this up to once again made for not me.</li>
