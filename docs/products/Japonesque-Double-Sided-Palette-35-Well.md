      <li>Good product to carry it whenever and whereever you need.</li>
      <li>It would be really great if they made this would a more durable palette.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect thing for a makeup artist kit definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>I love this product.the flexibility and practicality of being able to carry with me all my favorite lipsticks into 1 case is awesome.</li>
      <li>NICE IDEA HORRIBILY EXICUTED.</li>
      <li>u get to be your own designer.</li>
      <li>Also, it allows you to custom mix your own lipstick colours.  </li>
      <li>first of all the picture makes the palette look amazing and great for what we need, but when I got my pallet it look very cheap</li>
      <li>Easy!  </li>
      <li>great for makeup artists or lipstick junkies... easy to clean too</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a great size and very portable!  </li>
      <li>but most didn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>I bought this item along with the lip palette &#x27;set&#x27; that provides a silicone bowl and scoop because I wanted to have all the appropriate tools for melting the lipstick</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I think this is just ok, nothing to rush out and buy, there is probably a better option out there.</li>
      <li>As a makeup artist, I LOVE these Japonesque palettes.  </li>
      <li>blushes/foundations (or more lipstick).  </li>
      <li>I saw this one at one of my favorite makeup artists video tutorial and immediately looked where to buy it.</li>
      <li>Have 2 and already want more..</li>
      <li>This lipstick palette is really cute</li>
      <li>It is better than anything else I&#x27;ve seen out there.</li>
      <li>Just love them :))</li>
      <li>i am extremely happy with my order and how extremely fast i received it.</li>
      <li>I held the tube over a tea light candle flame for a couple of seconds and reattached the top of the lipstick.  </li>
      <li>Easy to travel with too.</li>
      <li>I was super excited!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s alot of cheap plastic with a cheap metal clasp.</li>
      <li>another cheap quality product coming from china..</li>
      <li>if you are against animal cruelty, it&#x27;s important to stick with it all around.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a bit time-consuming, but easy and worth the effort to have all my lipsticks in one, easy to see case instead of \\&quot;hunting\\&quot; in my drawer for the \\&quot;right\\&quot; shade for the day.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to get it, but it is flimsy and not sturdy.</li>
      <li>so my palette would turn out clean and organized (I&#x27;m a neat freak).</li>
      <li>I am a professional make-up artist and purchased this to combine some of the hundreds of lipsticks I own</li>
      <li>by the time you get one side full and close case</li>
      <li>pros design pallets full with color</li>
      <li>so i thought cool</li>
      <li>It shipped pretty quickly!  </li>
      <li>was quick and efficient.</li>
      <li>Great for cracking down on minimizing your kit.</li>
      <li>Convenient and fun to use.</li>
      <li>The outside is nice and durable, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the clasp.</li>
      <li>also when you heat/warm your lipstick so it can go nice and neat on to the plastic it melts and becomes flat..</li>
      <li>The first one i tried melted a couple of the palette spaces.</li>
      <li>Also, the clasp is secure, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it opening unexpectedly.  </li>
      <li>I melted my first lipstick in the microwave (Cyber by MAC) and proceeded to pour it out into the palette..</li>
      <li>and all in all my palette looks pretty crappy.</li>
      <li>So much fun and easy to open up and start mixing away if I need to!  </li>
      <li>with all the trouble, I love that this case is easy to toss in a bag and so compact.</li>
      <li>excellent way to use every last bit of lipstick from almost empty tubes, which is great if you&#x27;re using expensive lipsticks like Dior, Guerlain, Givenchy and Yves Saint</li>
      <li>I figured it was my mistake for heating it too hot, but it really wasn&#x27;t THAT hot.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m certainly going to look else</li>
      <li>they were all hardened, certain ones would pop out all the time.</li>
      <li>Thanks you</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I really like how convenient this is, As a makeup artist you don&#x27;t want to be carrying around 25 tubes of lipstick.</li>
      <li>Very durable, and nothings melted on me once.</li>
      <li>The amount of wells is amazing, and the white color is really helpful in distinguishing the different hues of the lipstick.  </li>
      <li>, I highly recommend this brand as I have purchased many other look a likes and they break</li>
      <li>the big wells hold about 1/3 of a full lipstick.</li>
      <li>The Japonesque 35-Well Palette is a lovely, black lacquer case that holds 21 lipsticks and 14 cream</li>
      <li>I wish this product was made with high quality construction considering the price.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Needless to say I was highly upset with the product although I think it would&#x27;ve been a great idea</li>
      <li>Although, you can use this for other cream products, I use them primarily for lipstick</li>
      <li>Next, I put the other part of the lipstick in a teaspoon, held it high over the tea light candle flame to slowly, gently melt it.  </li>
      <li>also recommend buying one or more of the small, 6-Well</li>
      <li>I would have preferred it hold ONLY lipstick (42 lipstick sized wells), but that just means one half has more lipstick, as I didn&#x27;t purchase it for holding blush/foundations.  </li>
      <li>I am a professional makeup artist and I was looking for an easier way to transport all of my lip colors without having to take ALL of my lipstick tubes with me everywhere.</li>
      <li>I fill it with different full coverage foundations on one side and concealers on the other.</li>
      <li>My one complaint is the plastic middle divider is a bit flimsy and doesn&#x27;t always flip very smoothly from side to side.</li>
      <li>Only negative is be sure to keep your brands separate.</li>
      <li>I simply took a small, clean, sharp knife to cut the lipstick at the very bottom of the tube.  </li>
      <li>This can be good for the total weight it adds but bad because the white plastic inserts don&#x27;t seem like they would hold up in air travel</li>

<li> When I compare this to other palettes that I have used it feels flimsy.</li>
<li> i mean a big cosmetic junky.</li>
<li> never warm your palette because it shrinks to become flat</li>
<li> The price of this product is ridiculous when you actually see the size of what you recieve.</li>
<li> I then cut it in half.  </li>
<li> instructions said to use a little dish to melt down the lipstick, then pour them in the palette.</li>
<li> I read about this in a magazine a few years ago.</li>
<li> I was super disappointed</li>
<li> I then printed small stickers with the brand and colour of the lipstick on them and stuck them to the divider.  </li>
<li> No more carrying lots and lots of lipstick tubes.</li>
<li> I did not hot pour my lipsticks into this because I was afraid it might warp.</li>
<li> very hard plastic cover to protect your lippies...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great for cracking down on minimizing your kit. When you feel like you need to start over, scoop out your product and use an oil base makeup remover. I put it in the dishwasher to try it out and there wasn&#x27;t any damage. Only negative is be sure to keep your brands separate. I&#x27;ve had a lot of vegan clients who didn&#x27;t want me to use it bc they compared it to cooking veggies on a grill that cooks meat. I totally get it bc if you are against animal cruelty, it&#x27;s important to stick with it all around.</li>
    <li> first of all the picture makes the palette look amazing and great for what we need, but when I got my pallet it look very cheap, I mean the inside is very thin and the divers get stuck and lipstick gets everywhere and does not look clean or should I say, it does not keep clean also the lipstick holders melts and shrink.  also when you heat/warm your lipstick so it can go nice and neat on to the plastic it melts and becomes flat.. its just doesn&#x27;t work if you want to use it never warm your palette because it shrinks to become flat and then you cant use it..</li>
    <li> I read about this in a magazine a few years ago. They recommended it as a way to consolidate lipstick tubes. I had a TON that had added up, so I figured it would be a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions said to use a little dish to melt down the lipstick, then pour them in the palette. The first one i tried melted a couple of the palette spaces. I figured it was my mistake for heating it too hot, but it really wasn&#x27;t THAT hot. A couple of the other ones warped the palette a little, but it is barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once they were all hardened, certain ones would pop out all the time. I think they might be no-smudge lipsticks, so maybe their chemistry keeps them from sticking to the palette. I would definitely recommend using a makeup brush to apply the lipstick; if I use my finger, it just doesn&#x27;t look as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with all the trouble, I love that this case is easy to toss in a bag and so compact. The outside is nice and durable, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the clasp. It would be really great if they made this would a more durable palette. If they don&#x27;t do that anytime soon, I would probably buy this again. It is better than anything else I&#x27;ve seen out there.</li>
    <li> I am a professional make-up artist and purchased this to combine some of the hundreds of lipsticks I own and it&#x27;s been great for that. My one complaint is the plastic middle divider is a bit flimsy and doesn&#x27;t always flip very smoothly from side to side.</li>
    <li> The best product quality on a makeup pallette. I love it. It is so usefull and it is like the big celebrity makeup artists.  It is GREAT!!</li>
    <li> The Japonesque 35-Well Palette is a lovely, black lacquer case that holds 21 lipsticks and 14 cream blushes/foundations (or more lipstick).  I would have preferred it hold ONLY lipstick (42 lipstick sized wells), but that just means one half has more lipstick, as I didn&#x27;t purchase it for holding blush/foundations.  Also, one of the wells \\&quot;popped up\\&quot; when I tried to fill it, rendering that well useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit time-consuming, but easy and worth the effort to have all my lipsticks in one, easy to see case instead of \\&quot;hunting\\&quot; in my drawer for the \\&quot;right\\&quot; shade for the day.  Also, it allows you to custom mix your own lipstick colours.  I simply took a small, clean, sharp knife to cut the lipstick at the very bottom of the tube.  I then cut it in half.  I held the tube over a tea light candle flame for a couple of seconds and reattached the top of the lipstick.  Next, I put the other part of the lipstick in a teaspoon, held it high over the tea light candle flame to slowly, gently melt it.  Then I poured it into the well.  Easy!  I then printed small stickers with the brand and colour of the lipstick on them and stuck them to the divider.  It&#x27;s also&lt;br /&gt;an excellent way to use every last bit of lipstick from almost empty tubes, which is great if you&#x27;re using expensive lipsticks like Dior, Guerlain, Givenchy and Yves Saint Laurent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend buying one or more of the small, 6-Well Japonesque Lipstick Palettes to de-clutter your purse.  Just use the same method to fill the palette and label the back.</li>
    <li> Great Item very handy. Fits great in my purses I never leave home without it. Easy to travel with too. Thanks you</li>
    <li> very hard plastic cover to protect your lippies... great for makeup artists or lipstick junkies... easy to clean too</li>
    <li> i am a junky i mean a big cosmetic junky. the big wells hold about 1/3 of a full lipstick. i called company and no one there knew what they were susposed to hold amount per square. very sad. i got this so i could view colors at a glance. pros design pallets full with color so i thought cool u get to be your own designer. this just didnt hold up to what i hoped for. by the time you get one side full and close case the pan doesnt want to stay in case so they smear all over the divider and divider gets stuck on colors. hoped divider would help for cleaness for colors. GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NICE IDEA HORRIBILY EXICUTED.</li>
    <li> As a makeup artist, I LOVE these Japonesque palettes.  They&#x27;re a great size and very portable!  Also, the clasp is secure, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it opening unexpectedly.  The amount of wells is amazing, and the white color is really helpful in distinguishing the different hues of the lipstick.  Although, you can use this for other cream products, I use them primarily for lipstick and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  So much fun and easy to open up and start mixing away if I need to!  Just love them :)) Have 2 and already want more..</li>
    <li> I saw this one at one of my favorite makeup artists video tutorial and immediately looked where to buy it. I love this product.the flexibility and practicality of being able to carry with me all my favorite lipsticks into 1 case is awesome. No more carrying lots and lots of lipstick tubes. This is great product. Anybody who loves makeup and lipstick should have it! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this product. I am a professional makeup artist and I was looking for an easier way to transport all of my lip colors without having to take ALL of my lipstick tubes with me everywhere. I bought this item along with the lip palette &#x27;set&#x27; that provides a silicone bowl and scoop because I wanted to have all the appropriate tools for melting the lipstick so my palette would turn out clean and organized (I&#x27;m a neat freak). I was super excited! I melted my first lipstick in the microwave (Cyber by MAC) and proceeded to pour it out into the palette..initially it looked like everything was going well until the &#x27;well&#x27; melted UPWARD and wasted the lipstick all over the palette! I was super disappointed but I kept going and some of the wells stayed in tact but most didn&#x27;t and all in all my palette looks pretty crappy. The price of this product is ridiculous when you actually see the size of what you recieve. it&#x27;s alot of cheap plastic with a cheap metal clasp. Needless to say I was highly upset with the product although I think it would&#x27;ve been a great idea I&#x27;m certainly going to look else where. Maybe an art supply store.</li>
    <li> This is a staple accessory that any artist should have in their kit, a fashion week MUST HAVE! I fill it with different full coverage foundations on one side and concealers on the other. Very durable, and nothings melted on me once.</li>
    <li> I wish this product was made with high quality construction considering the price.  It shipped pretty quickly!  I&#x27;d like to buy the foundation palette, but there is NO WAY I am paying $60 for it.&lt;br /&gt;The shipper was great was quick and efficient.</li>
    <li> Best box on the market for lipsticks , I highly recommend this brand as I have purchased many other look a likes and they break Japonesque holds up , great product .</li>
    <li> I really like how convenient this is, As a makeup artist you don&#x27;t want to be carrying around 25 tubes of lipstick. The only reason it got 4 instead of 5 is the plastic is very flimsy and weak</li>
    <li> another cheap quality product coming from china.. what a disappointment.. I was excited to get it, but it is flimsy and not sturdy.</li>
    <li> Convenient and fun to use. Highly recommended. Fits a lot of lipsticks, just be careful not to fill while theyre too hot or the plastic raises offering less space in the individual well. A must have!</li>
    <li> i am extremely happy with my order and how extremely fast i received it. I couldnt be happier. This is the perfect thing for a makeup artist kit definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> When I compare this to other palettes that I have used it feels flimsy. This can be good for the total weight it adds but bad because the white plastic inserts don&#x27;t seem like they would hold up in air travel well. I did not hot pour my lipsticks into this because I was afraid it might warp. I just used a spatula and swabbed in into place, then used a label maker to add the swatch names to the divider. I think this is just ok, nothing to rush out and buy, there is probably a better option out there.</li>
    <li> This lipstick palette is really cute and i have actually added the lipsticks into it. Good product to carry it whenever and whereever you need.</li>
