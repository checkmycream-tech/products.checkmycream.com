<li> im going crazy for more .</li>
<li> Deep, short, messy waves it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
<li> Really expensive for just a brush, but you gotta use it for yourself first !</li>
<li> From hard to medium to the soft one&#x27;s.</li>
<li> This brush as well as the hard and medium (which I also have) are all key brushes to have.</li>
<li> And once you lay your waves down with a tsurag..</li>
<li> The curvature of this  brush lays my hair down helping my waves connect and given my hair shine / softness.</li>
<li> I also use the medium to lay it down</li>
<li> I have to retract my previous review on CQP.</li>
<li> but this one is definitely one of the marquee brushes to have if you&#x27;re dead serious about keeping, forming and maintaining waves.</li>
<li> Waves after a few times using the brush.  </li>
<li> all day long my pattern and connection is off the chain if anybody tryna get they wave game</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t  have crazy thick waves  like some guys on you tube ,but they get a lot of compliments.</li>
<li> It expensive, but you get what you pay for.</li>
<li> I was disappointing to received my brush without the carrying case the company advertised, but over all I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
<li> I will like to by it because my brushes I got are terrible</li>

    <li> This is the must have brush for any dude out there that wants THE brush for wavy hair. I&#x27;m not sure how many other users on here follow the wavebuilder or Crown Quality Products Facebook pages but this one is definitely one of the marquee brushes to have if you&#x27;re dead serious about keeping, forming and maintaining waves. Deep, short, messy waves it doesn&#x27;t matter. This brush as well as the hard and medium (which I also have) are all key brushes to have. I never thought there would be an almost cult following for hair brushes but these things are worth the money and more. Beware........when you look to buy one - make sure they&#x27;re in stock first. I waited a month for my medium wave brush off the actual crown website.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery got the brush in 3 days like estimated. This brush is the truth if you want waves fast get one. I have the medium brush already but I think i am going like this softy better.</li>
    <li> This one is perfect! The overall handle and the consistency of the bristles is perfect for that low hair cut. A must have</li>
    <li> you betta get one. i got mines the best brush on the market . im going crazy for more . i just got two im getting 4 more. i call them transformers cause ya waves transforms lol real talk</li>
    <li> cqp on its way to the crib love this brush</li>
    <li> Product was everything I expected👍</li>
    <li> I have to retract my previous review on CQP. I have the medium soft Crown Gold Brush and it is by far the best brush i&#x27;ve even owned. Let me begin by stating this brush is top notch quality! The curvature of this  brush lays my hair down helping my waves connect and given my hair shine / softness. I highly recommend buy this brush, you will see your waves your transform the first time your use this brush guaranteed! I currently own CQP medium and soft brush and plan on purchasing there King Brush and No Line Durags when released, which I learned about while reading an inspirational article on CQP CEO Robert Watson ( [...] ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone that view my previous review, it was a common misunderstanding and everything has been resolved, CQP is an honest company and I support them 100% and plan on doing more business with them in the very near future.</li>
    <li> For those of yall hatin of the 360 gold wave brush, your not wolfing that&#x27;s why your waves still suck. These brushes curve to your head, and pull those coarse spots of your hair apart, giving you more waves. And once you lay your waves down with a tsurag..you&#x27;ll be spinnin bra! Buy this bursh. It expensive, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This brush is as advertised! I&#x27;m in my 8th week of wolfing I also use the medium to lay it down but after I come out the du-rag it&#x27;s soft all day long my pattern and connection is off the chain if anybody tryna get they wave game right I suggest you cop the medium and soft. Brushing gives you waves not the products an this is the best brush to get&#x27;em</li>
    <li> I thought I would not purchase a  wave brush for twenty plus dollars but I did, and glad the brush was in  stock, waited three months. I kept checking the Amazon  site  got lucky one  night I was at work. The brush feels good on my head. I don&#x27;t  have crazy thick waves  like some guys on you tube ,but they get a lot of compliments. Would recommend..</li>
    <li> Crown brushes are great but the don&#x27;t rely on cosmetics because they will fade and peel shouldn&#x27;t if you paying 20 bucks for a brush but works really good.</li>
    <li> This is top of the line stuff right here. if you want the waves annd the style of being a true waver, then gets this brush and become part of the waving nation its definitlety worth it! #crownqualityproducts!</li>
    <li> Can u bring this brush back in I will like to by it because my brushes I got are terrible</li>
