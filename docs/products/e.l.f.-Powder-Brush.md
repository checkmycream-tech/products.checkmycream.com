<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got this brush broken, and never got a replacement. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This brush makes the perfect addition to my brush collection. I would even go as far to say it was one of the best $3 investment in my whole makeup collection. I personally use this brush to blend out my powdered contour and highlight on days I want a less dramatic look. It&#x27;s also awesome to apply E.L.F&#x27;s HD sheer powder. The best part about synthetic bristles is that it distributes product rather than soaking it up. This means that it would also be suitable for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the reviews about the handle and ferrule coming unglued from each other, you&#x27;re not washing your brush properly. You should NEVER soak your brushes. In fact, the handle should NEVER come in contact with water. You think you&#x27;re &amp;#34;deep cleansing&amp;#34; but really you&#x27;re creating a harbor for mold and mildew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean my bristles with baby shampoo on my hand or silicone brush egg then when rinsed wrap up in toilet paper to secure the brush shape (as suggested by MannyMUA on YouTube).</li>
    <li> I decided to take a try at elf products!  For the money you can&#x27;t beat the quality of this brush.  I will be back for more brushes and elf products!</li>
    <li> I use this brush to apply and buff bronzer or blush. I have a similar brush from Sephora and this one is truly better. I usually go by the motto \\&quot;you get what you pay for,\\&quot; but this brush seems to go against that saying. It hasn&#x27;t shed at all and I&#x27;ve had it about a month and have washed it twice. It works for applying powder, but it also is excellent for blending my BB cream, which sometimes leaves some harsh lines on my jaw bone. It&#x27;s not the absolute best brush I&#x27;ve ever used, but it&#x27;s one of the best and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Used this brush for applying foundation also worked out so good got so many compliments that my face was glowing.use it you will love it</li>
    <li> This is truly a great deal for the price. Wonderfully effective brush for liquid foundation--fast, full coverage for an airbrushed look. The brush is lightweight, the synthetic bristles dense but oh-so-soft. Have washed it several times and experienced little to no shedding. In fact, it shed one or two bristles on first washing, but never again. Will likely buy two or three more as back ups.</li>
    <li> this brush is overall great! you cant go wrong with a decent quality brush for only $3. Now, the thing is a lot of bloggers have said they use this for stippling liquid foundation. I wouldnt use it for that. Simply because this brush has a huge head! Its way too big to be used to apply foundation, in my opinion. I like it for its intended use, applying powder. It applies loose powder and powder blushes like a dream! It cleans well too and Ive had very little shedding with it. It even comes with a brush guard. You gotta buy it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> So soft and works great for all powders and blushes. Love this brush. Also washes very well.</li>
    <li> I love how soft this brush is! It&#x27;s great for using it for powder. BUT I&#x27;ve owned it for under a week and the top snapped off. It still works, but it&#x27;s annoying that it has broken so quickly.</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic. It has definitely already replaced my ecotools retractable kabuki brush that I was originally using for my mineral foundation. I find that this brush picks up the foundation better and somehow fuses it to my skin better as well. I am new to the mineral foundation community and I have to say at first, I was really debating if it was worth all the time it required to apply it, especially in the mornings. Not only does it last all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge or wear off, the price is pretty fantastic. This brush is also a multi tool for your make up collection. This could be used with wet or dry foundation, with blush, browser etc. Great buy, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I know that this brush is for powder, but I use it for foundation, and it works perfectly for ME. I&#x27;ve used several different tools for my foundation, but this has worked best for ME. Yes, it is large, but if you know how to apply makeup, you won&#x27;t have a problem using it for liquid foundation. It&#x27;s amazing. I don&#x27;t know if another tool is going to do a better job. In fact, I&#x27;ve used a MAC liquid foundation brush, one that cost about fifty dollars, yet I&#x27;m still sticking to this one. Man. I am not over exaggerating, this brush is amazing. I&#x27;ve used it every other day for a month, cleaned it once (Not including wiping the access makeup off with makeup remover towelettes when I finish using it) .... And it&#x27;s still just as amazing as it was when I first got it.</li>
    <li> Definitely one of the best brushes for foundation not just for powder! I actually use it more fore foundation, it blends so perfect</li>
    <li> Elf studio complexion brush, is useful for foundation, mineral makeup, blush, and I use it for all of the above. What I like is that the bristles are full and soft and the brush holds the powder well so I get a nice even application.  The brush is antibacterial and made from synthetic talkon hair This is one of my better beauty finds this season. It was just what I was looking for and so affordable. I can confirm that it is just as nice, if not nicer similar brushes that cost 3 times as much. For $3 it is a sweet steal.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. It gives a flawless airbrush look when applying my bare Minerals foundation. It claims it&#x27;s for powder but it blends well with liquid foundation as well. Just be sure to apply your foundation on your face with your fingers first then use this for blending. beautiful results.</li>
    <li> Before I stumbled upon this brush, I was using a complexion brush from elf&#x27;s studio line to apply my powder foundation, and it just wasn&#x27;t giving me the coverage I wanted. So after seeing the price of the powder brush, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My foundation has never lookd better! Because the bristles are so densely packed and the top is flat, my foundation is blended to perfection. This is also perfect to apply blush because it picks up just the right amount. This brush makes for a perfect, airbrushed look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the price point, you definitely can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush. It hasn&#x27;t even shed on my yet! None of the product gets pushed down into the bristles, which I love because not as much of the product is being wasted, as if when I was using a rounder powder brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I definitely recommed this brush due to its affordability, and ability to apply products beautifully.</li>
    <li> I needed a new powder/foundation brush because my old one was falling apart. When I saw the e.l.f. Studio Powder Brush at Target for only $3, I wanted to try it. I was pleasantly surprised when I got home and used it. It was comparable to my old $25 powder/foundation brush. There are only 2 things I want to caution potential buyers about: 1.) It does start to shed eventually. and 2.) When you wash it, make sure you hold it bristle-side down because if you get too much water on it, the handle part will come off of the brush part. I learned that the hard way. Overall though, it&#x27;s a decent quality brush for a cheap price.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research and wanted to try a stipple brush for applying my new mac nc 40 foundation. I found this brush at the local target store, and was hesistant as it said powder brush, but they had no stipple brush in stock and from the look of it, compared to a high end prices brush I saw at the mall make up counter it felt and looked the same.&lt;br /&gt;I was absolutely surprised by how well it works as stipple brush. I put one pump of the mac studio fix foundation on an old mirror, and spread it out a bit with a regualar foundation brush, also from elf, and then I lightly dab in the powder brush , then lightly tab on all areas of my face, (cheeks, forehead, chin) and then use a swirl motion , very lightly to blend in . I am amazed on how well the brush works, been using it for like 2 weeks by now, and no loss of bristles, I think for the amazing price of $ 3 I will just buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Only wish it would come in a smaller size (diameter of brush) so it is easier to get in the area around the eyes, but after trying my best to lightly blend it in that area, i use the foundation brush to finish up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also do have the elf, eyeshadow brush, the eyeliner brush, their whole line is an amazing quality product for a very affordable price. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush! I love using this to stiple my makeup! I will buy another one just for keep sake and traveling! You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush! It&#x27;s easy to clean, no fallout hairs and really smooth on the skin.</li>
    <li> If you plan on using this a lot like I do, I&#x27;d maybe invest in a quality brush elsewhere as the bristles began falling out of mine in clumps not long after I received it. The brush itself doesn&#x27;t feel very sturdy and wobbles a bit, but it does what I want it to do (apply powder/blend my foundation).</li>
    <li> I love this brush!! I use it for liquid, powder, cream. You name it! I actually stipple my liquid foundation on with it first n then apply my cream blush and then my setting powder all with the same brush. I wash it daily n the only problem I have is that it takes a long time to dry. But I would definitely repurchase when I get a chance. It&#x27;s a great brush to have whether you use wet or dry makeup with it. It&#x27;s the perfect single face brush to have when you travel since it does everything haha. I love it. I have experienced a little fall out but I mean with the price who cares? It&#x27;s very dense. Fairly large in my opinion. I sometimes find it too large for my face but I do absolutely love this brush.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It is so soft and it applies loose powder like a dream. I definitely would recommend this brush to anyone. I wouldnt recommend buying it from here though, because i bought it for about half the price its listed at here at my local Target.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this brush on amazon, I purchased it at target. I absolutely LOVE this brush. Softer than I expected and blends my face products like a dream! The only caution I&#x27;d say is, watch the way you wash it. Hasn&#x27;t shed on me yet but I expect it to in the near future.</li>
    <li> It was bigger and it works like s charm for powder makeup its awesome I would recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> i have been looking for a good brush for my foundations. after reading around, i decided to try out this brush. i bought 2. its perfect for both foundation and powder. its a great buy and worth trying it out. would recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> Worked great for a week then it started shedding everywhere, really sucked.</li>
    <li> I use this for buffing my mousse cover and putting on my powder.  no complaints,</li>
    <li> After opening the package the Brush completely fell off the wooden handle. The only reason I gave it a two star review is it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a makeup brush to use with my Bare Minerals compact, and this works perfectly. The bristles are firm enough to hold the powder, but soft on my face. I absolutely love the feeling of it, and sometimes end of adding extra makeup just to feel the brush slide across my skin. Plus cleaning is fairly easy, unlike some of my other brushes which need more tlc to get clean. I would certainly recommend this brush to others as well as re-purchase.</li>
    <li> This brush works really well especially id you have a good technique when using its anyone can use this brush and get creative thank you it came quick and in great condition</li>
    <li> I like the brush my only problem was when I took it out of wrapping, the brush was loose on the handle like it wasn&#x27;t glued on good. A little disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I use it to apply both pressed and loose powder on my face. It is dense enough but at the same time it isn&#x27;t too dense. This brush is great for the price! I also find that whenever I wash the brush, it doesn&#x27;t shed like other cheap brushes. This is a great buy</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price. I wear Sweet Face Minerals (not to be confused with Sweet minerals) and some Bare Minerals. I have two of these brushes. I use one for foundation and the other for veil/finishing powder, etc. It&#x27;s great for buffing them in. Cleans easily and stays soft with proper cleaning/drying. I dry my brushes upside down so as to not damage the handles and they dry faster. It doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive to be good quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to apply setting poweder for on-camera make-up and although it is soft, everytime I used it, 5-8 bristles would fall out. So logically the more you use it, the less bristles you&#x27;ll have.  If you follow that line of conclusional thinking, eventually you&#x27;ll be left with a really nice plastic stick. But I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Love LOVE LOVEE this brush!! it is so soft and PERFECT to apply powder. I got my smashbox halo Perfecting powder and I will use this baby to make my skin flawless :)) totally recommend this brush in your kit.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!  I use it for powder and it has very even coverage, and is so easy to use!  You cannot mess up your powder using this!  Perfect!</li>
    <li> Always in search of a great make-up brush and at an affordable price, I got this brush in hopes it would be like the Sigma Flat Kabuki brush. I love this brush. It&#x27;s soft and has nicely packed bristles. I have experienced some stray brush hairs on my check when using it but I feel like that&#x27;s normal with newer brushes. I have used this with liquid foundation as well as BB cream and it works really well. Definitely recommend getting this if you want an affordable flat top brush!</li>
    <li> This brush is AMAZING. I&#x27;ve been using it foreverrrr. I&#x27;ve tried more expensive brushes just to try something different to see if there is something better and I&#x27;ve always gone right back to this brush. I would purchase this over more expensive brushes any day and especially for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> For applying powder, this brush it great, it applies evenly and gives a nice finish to powder over foundation (how I usually use it).  It picks up and holds powder well, but doesn&#x27;t absorb it or foundation.  Better than I would expect for an inexpensive brush.  The issue I&#x27;ve had with this brush, though, is that the metal has come apart from the bush handle.  It only took a couple months of use, and the not-so-great construction of the brush was exposed.  I tried to glue the parts back together, but there is so much wiggle room between the metal and wood that it will not stay together.  Currently in the market for a powder brush that will function and not fall apart.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. It gives a great finish, doesn&#x27;t shed, cleans easily....it&#x27;s just a good brush. I got this at Target for 3 bucks, so it was really a steal. Definitely a good purchase.</li>
    <li> This brush is pretty good for the price. I have owned it for about 4 years and it&#x27;s still intact. The hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much as I thought it would have; Doesn&#x27;t happen very often but it does every so often.</li>
    <li> I thought it was a flat brush, it is actually round and puffy</li>
    <li> I love how soft this brush is.  I use it to apply my liquid foundation, concealer and my finishing powder. I don&#x27;t want to use any other brush! lol  gives me a nice natural look, blends everything nicely and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft and yet durable. I&#x27;ve had no shedding. This brush gives great coverage and can be used for so many different things.</li>
    <li> I buy all my brushes through elf, they&#x27;re cheap and nice quality. Why pay more than $1-3 on a makeup brush when it works just as well as the $15+ ones. Definitely a good purchase.</li>
    <li> The brush has soft bristles and makes stippling and even blending easier. I sometimes use it to apply foundation and the brush works very well. Nothing super special but it gets the job done. I haven&#x27;t had any fall out and I use it for foundation, concealer, face powder, and any other product I feel like using at the time. On my leisure days, I&#x27;ve used this brush to apply everything and the finish was very nice.</li>
    <li> Perfect for applying liquid foundations ... gives you that airbrushed look. Very easy to clean as well. Very well made for the price. I like to have at least two so one is always dry and clean. At this price why not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and i love it. Its a goo powder brush, i still haven&#x27;t experimented with another type of makeup other than powder, but it works really good with powder. As for anyone who says it takes long to dry after washing it, all you have to do is wash before you go to bed. By the time i wake up mine is always clean, dry and ready to do its stuff. (and that goes to washing any make up brush)</li>
    <li> I adore this brush! I am glad that I decided to buy it. However, I purchased mine from the e.l.f website which I believe it&#x27;s a little cheaper there but even on here for $8 this brush is a bargain. It works well for powder, foundation, and even blush.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush! I used to think that my stippling brush was the best when it came to applying my BB cream/foundation but I was totally wrong. This brush makes your make-up go on so naturally that I&#x27;ve had people ask me if I&#x27;m even wearing make-up at all! I know its for powder/blush but I love it for BB cream more than anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I used it for the first time today, it applied my liquid foundation very nicely. love it!!</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing brush. I used it for my contours and blush! I&#x27;m in love with how soft it feels! Great buy.</li>
    <li> Favorite brush for such a great price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about this brush as a liquid foundation brush. I have one similar to it from Coastal Scents and have been using that for a while. I finally purchased this here and I must say I prefer this one over the other one! It applies my foundation evenly and i also use this brush to set it with powder if I&#x27;m in a hurry. It works great! I want to try sigma brushes as well but I am honestly satisfied with this brush so I am in no hurry. And for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. Shipping was fast too :-)</li>
    <li> Make up brushes can be so expensive, but I found this one @ target for $3.00, and it&#x27;s a very decent brush! However, the first one I purchased the hairs came out almost immediately; complained and it was replaced. This one I&#x27;ve had for a months now and it&#x27;s perfectly fine. Works great. I like it just as much as the brush I had before that I paid $25.00&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d really suggest this brush for someone on a budget, it&#x27;s not top of the line, but it gets the job done!!!!!</li>
    <li> This brush is awesomeeee! I love it. Its actually the first REAL makeup brush I&#x27;ve bought. I use it to apply my foundation and sometimes powders. My skin is sensitive and acne prone and this brush doesnt irritate my face. The bristles are very soft and don&#x27;t shed a lot. I really like it. Although I&#x27;d rather buy it from Walmart instead of going through the hassle of ordering it online. They&#x27;re also only $3 at Walmart, target etc. Overall its an AMAZING brush i definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> as people have said this brush is AMAZINGG. i love it for patting on foundation. so soft and dense i love love love love love it!! but i agree walmart is now selling it and target has for awhile, I believe even the elf website sells it for half the price but it truly is amazing</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase. I use it to apply medium coverage powders and foundation. It&#x27;s really soft on my face. Plan on purchasing more!!</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and the brush is nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this brush exceeded expectations, soft bristles and even application, i love it! You get a bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> After reading many positive reviews, I decided to pick up this brush for 3 bucks at Target. This is one of the better Elf purchases I&#x27;ve made. I love the control of this brush: It picks up the product easily, but does not absorb it like many other brushes do. Therefore, it provides a really nice application of your bronzer/blush. By the way, the bristles are extremely soft and feel amazing when applying makeup! Do yourself a favor and drop the 3 dollars on this brush. The price for the quality is insane, and I mean that in a good way!</li>
    <li> This brush is really firm yet soft on the skin, it was recommended by a friend, she says Elf brushes are really good quality at a low price. Now I testify to that, the only thing is that I should have ordered the retractable brush but I still LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  Its soft, but covers the facial area perfectly.  I love the fact that is inexpensive but easily comparable to other name brands.</li>
    <li> This thing is a work of art. It&#x27;s like a beauty blender for liquid foundation! I have yet to use it on powdered foundations but this thing is really something else! BUY IT!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love using this product as my foundation brush. The elf brush just gives my face a natural finish.This is my 3rd time buying this brush and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush! It&#x27;s inexpensive, it feels nice, and it works! Also, the hairs don&#x27;t fall out, a problem I&#x27;ve had with other (more expensive!) brushes, so that&#x27;s a plus! :)&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, I got it at Target for $3, so I think your best bet is to get it there instead of here.</li>
    <li> Fabulous brush....I have rosacea so my skin reacts to just about anything that touches it! it&#x27;s a year later and not one issue. Nothing shedding. I use this with Youngblood loose mineral foundation. between the two, I no longer have redness on my face to be embarrassed about! fyi Youngblood is almost half the price on amazon versus buying it elsewhere ;) a MUST BUY!</li>
    <li> Bristles fall out just after one use. It&#x27;s cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t work well. Even as an add-on, just a buck or two, I&#x27;d still pass.</li>
    <li> Great brush for  liquid foudation or to apply powder! Feels like a good quality brush without being pricey! Will recommend this brush!!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to use with a liquid makeup.  It is a nice quality brush and so far has worked well.</li>
    <li> for its price it is a very good brush i use it as powder brush and i really like it .somepeople use it for foundation i tried and i didnt like it for foundation so i am only using it for powder application .</li>
    <li> This brush is soft and does the job. Well worth the price. It sheds a little but no big deal.</li>
    <li> So easy to recommend this brush. If I could order again (and will with next order) will add a couple to the cart as when I do MUA work it is nice to have a series of brushes. For the value here the brush performs very well. Great for powders - but I can also blend with it when using minimal coverage or with blending powders.</li>
    <li> I love my brush but I was disappointing when I went into Wal-Mart and saw the same brush and the same brand, and it was only $3.00</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s very soft and great quality ! No complaints !</li>
    <li> I love this brush, its perfect for powders and liquid foundations. You wont be disappointed. A year later and I still love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tested it with both my creme and powder foundations, and this brush gives good coverage without looking cakey.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would try this brush after having a good experince with e.l.f.&#x27;s Stipple Brush.&lt;br /&gt;I had previously been using a buffing brush from another company for my foundations but I will be using e.l.f. Studio Powder from now on &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This brush is a Soft and long lasting, You can not beat the price.  I would order this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this flat blush! Ive been wanting one that I can blend all my makeup and contouring with and&lt;br /&gt;this brush is a hit with me!! I love it and recommend it!</li>
    <li> Its a Geat brush i love it!&lt;br /&gt;I was not sure about getting it, but good thing i did !</li>
    <li> I bought this at target and it&#x27;s very soft, and applies powder very well. I love it and all, but the handle is very loose after awhile and starts to break off. I&#x27;ve had mine for a little over a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned my elf Studio Powder Brush for 2 years now &amp; it&#x27;s still going strong! This is one of the highest quality brushes from their line-the brush itself is densely packed making powders or liquid foundations easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I&#x27;ve had is the metal ferrule has fallen off-nothing a little hot glue can&#x27;t fix, and it happens to almost every elf brush I&#x27;ve owned now so it&#x27;s just routine at this point. Still a great brush to have!</li>
    <li> my go to brush. does what its suppose to,good quality, soft, and is a great price. why not try it?</li>
    <li> This will make ur makeup look good if used correctly. If ur looking for a nice brush though this is not it. But really what do u expect for the price. But its great for just starters or for someone wanting to try this type of brush when applying makeup to see if they like it. It works nice but sheds like crazy and before I had ever used it, right out of the package the top was broke and had to glue it back on ( for the price I was not going to return and buy another 1 and I wanted to try this type of brush for my foundation) so it had its negatives but again for the price its a great start.  For people with really dry skin or patches it might not be the best type of brush for u due to the fact ur just buffing and moving the dry dead skin around and it doesn&#x27;t look good. And I don&#x27;t think it will last long but again for the price and just for starters or trying this kind of brush go for it.</li>
    <li> I love elf and I could never find a power brush anywhere so I bought it off here and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> This brush is great! I own several elf studio brushes and they are almost the same quality as some professional brushes. I always use this brush for my powder foundation and it works very well.</li>
    <li> Worked great for me!!! im thinking about ordering more very soon. I  love this powder brush. Its even good to apply your foundation with.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for about a year. I use it for buffing on liquid foundation, and for setting with a powder. It works beautifully in both capacities! For a while I was using this brush every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as dense as my Real Techniques expert face brush, but still pretty dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes forever to dry after a cleaning XD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With certain foundations (very specific ones), I can&#x27;t use this brush and must use my fingers, or the foundation will settle into my pores. I am not sure if it is the brush or the foundation that is at fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a $3 brush, the bristles are super densely packed! Bunched together they make a bundle the size of the ferule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great size - it is pretty big, which makes blending foundation SO fast! I&#x27;ve mostly switched to using my Real Techniques brush for every day, but when I&#x27;m in a hurry I will use this one. It is amazing how quickly it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives a beautiful, smooth, buffed application - no streaks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds up to washing, very durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheds maybe one or two hairs in a week of heavy useage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $3 this brush is ABSOLUTELY worth it! If you are new to makeup, or have been applying your liquid foundation with your fingers or a sponge, this is a great starter brush to see if you like this method of application. It speeds up the process significantly and is a very small investment for good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the Real Techniques core collection and Expert Face brush, this might not be an essential addition. That said, this brush is bigger than those, so I think it&#x27;s a worthwhile addition because it makes large applications quicker.</li>
    <li> Didnt like this brush at all. It doesn&#x27;t apply evenly for me because the bristles were not in the right shape when I recieved it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about two years. I bought it primarily to apply blush and finishing powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; brush -- the others were for lip, concealer, eyes -- so not knowing anything, I really liked this brush. It&#x27;s extremely soft (on both the fingers and face), the brush in its entirety isn&#x27;t too big or too small, and it&#x27;s a really good price ($3 at Target excluding tax)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a blush and finishing powder brush, it&#x27;s too dense for my personal taste. Because it&#x27;s so dense, often times I&#x27;d end up applying too much powder to one spot, requiring more time spent on blending or using powder to dull the color. I recently switched to Real Technique&#x27;s Multitask Brush because it allows more subtle, flowing movement and enjoy it much more for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I switched to the Real Techniques Multitask Brush, I&#x27;ve recently begun using e.l.f.&#x27;s Studio Powder Brush for just applying my BB cream. I heard many reviewers say this brush is great for foundation and even for BB. I&#x27;m currently using Lumene&#x27;s Vitamin C+ Illuminating Anti-Aging BB Cream, which has a slight more gel texture than my previous Missha&#x27;s M Signature Real Complete BB Cream. I think this brush doesn&#x27;t apply the BB cream well because of the more gel-like texture. The bristles don&#x27;t pick up the BB well from my hand, so I have to directly apply the BB on my face before using the brush. I&#x27;ve tried spotting my face with the BB then using the brush to spread it, but the brush is very dense in the center and not stiff enough on the outside so it doesn&#x27;t spread it well. I end up with BB-less spots on my face, requiring me to use more product than I would just using my fingers. Now I&#x27;ve resorted to using my fingers, then using the brush to blend/buff it on my face. The brush would probably apply my Missha BB Cream better because it&#x27;s more fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced much shedding, albeit 3-5 hairs on my facce within the two years of use. I only experienced two hairs recently probably because using it to apply the BB requires more bristle movement than applying powder does. However, after about 1 year, the handle has gotten more loose so it now wiggles back and forth when I move the brush around on my face. The wiggling probably affects my BB applying experience, so perhaps I would enjoy this brush more if I got a new one. I&#x27;ve contemplated getting a new same brush, but have heard from several other reviewers of the same problem and I don&#x27;t want it to happen again. I&#x27;ve also tried pulling the handle out so I can possible re-glue it to make the handle stop moving but it won&#x27;t pull out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two other small worries are also the fading logo and drying time. It bothers me how the logo/writing on the brush handle end is fading, but this is a common problem so more forgivable. Because the brush is dense, it also takes more than 6 hours to dry (my experience), so I have to remember to time my washing for my morning use.</li>
    <li> so soft and easy to use!</li>
    <li> the brush sheds after every use :( the price is cheap and so is the quality. small little hairs from the brush are left over my face and floor. I rather invest in a brush that will last.</li>
    <li> Great for foundation.</li>
    <li> My favorite for applying my bare minerals. Had purchased one at target previously. They don&#x27;t last very long, but for the price that&#x27;s okay with me!</li>
    <li> It is like a those expensive professional brushes but with a lower price! &amp; absolutely fantastic brush!! Must buy! Doesn&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome!  I used it with wet product and amazing finish, can&#x27;t beat the price.  On time and as expected.</li>
    <li> I use this to clean up my phone and statue..</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I use it for my foundation, blush, powder, conceler.. Everything.  I was so impressed with the shipping i recieved it early and in more than a 4 day process.  I definatly will be a returning shopper.  Thanks so much for this amazing product.</li>
    <li> Ell.f products are really good for the price.  I use this brush every day and it is holding up just fine.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. One of my favorites so soft and blends well.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush its soft.</li>
    <li> This is my go to foundation brush! yet it may get alittle wiggle because it is fairly cheap but what I do is re-glue the insides. the foundation doesnt seep into the brush, whenever i use this for my foundation routine, it never  ends with ANY reisude , what liquid is on the brush, all gets to ur face, with leaving nothing behind. distributes the foundation nice an evenly . i just cant love it enough. even my sigma or sedona lace flat tops seep in the foundation, not this one!</li>
    <li> The handle broke the 2nd time I used it. Pure crap.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing makeup brush.  I use it with my mineral foundation and powder.  I liked it so much, I bought it to use with my blush.</li>
    <li> Wondeful Powder brush by ELF..have used more expensive brushes but this one works just the same and is so inexpensive!</li>
    <li> I was as delighted as many others were with the discovery of the ELF powder brush. For three dollars, your really can&#x27;t beat the results. I use this for liquid foundations by stippling, then swirling/buffing in the makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will, however, add a disclaimer. I&#x27;ve bought several of these because I find that these brushes DO shed incrementally with cleanings... In fact, I&#x27;ve never quite seen a brush shed like THIS one. Handfuls of hairs literally fall out, leaving you with a much less dense brush... Cleanings should be more sparse for this reason, and perhaps with a milder shampoo... thing is, these taklon fibers can be (in my experience) difficult to clean without a good soaking... If you guys have any tips on how to properly clean these brushes to reduce shedding, I am open. I would not recommend ELF shampoo or MAC brush cleanser as the former is insufficient, and the latter is mega expensive.</li>
    <li> ELF studio brushes are wonderful and is very close to some of the more expensive brushes. I have this one, as well as the C brush, angle eyeliner brush, fan brush, and the crease contour brush. These brushes can be purchased at Target for $3. This is highway robbery to spend almost $11 for a $3 brush. People go to Target.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s there to say that hasn&#x27;t been said already about this brush. It&#x27;s so loved for a reason, or many. It&#x27;s super soft, feels completely luxurious, it&#x27;s packed with hairs that hardly ever fall out even with rough use, and it&#x27;s cheap. I have 2 now, 1 I use daily for loose  mineral makeup and the other in case I ever want to stipple foundation as well. Great for both.</li>
    <li> I heard about these brushes on youtube. Some of the make up artists gave it a good review. So I tried it. Actually I ordered 2 and I was so glad I did. It blends liquid foundation into a light airbrushed look. Just right for me.</li>
    <li> This brush is the bomb. Love, Love it. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> better than i expected</li>
    <li> I love it. I&#x27;m sooo happy i bought it. It scrubs on the brush, and leaves a perfect result! Pluss, it is cheep!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush it is soft and packed full of brush hair( or whatever you would call them)</li>
    <li> This brush applies the powder evenly and lightly so as not to cake your face. Definitely well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I saw this brush on a YouTube foundation routine video so I ordered it to try it out and its fantastic. I use it all the time because it belnds liquid foundations really well. I do not recommend using it with powder. Does not shed and can also be used as a buffer brush.</li>
    <li> I bought the brush for 3.00$ at Target and thought why not, let&#x27;s just try it. I was really surprised how soft it was and I use it as a powder brush as well as a bronzer brush. The value is really amazing. You can&#x27;t go wrong, especially with the price.</li>
    <li> I really liked this brush but it broke after 2 months. I am so disappointed. I ended up going to a drugstore and buying a much more expensive one.</li>
    <li> It is a great brush for $3, good for powder and also to be used as stippling/buffing brush with liquid foundation.Mine is soft does not shed and handle is still intact so far.It is not going to last me years,perhaps, but than I can throw it away without a regret and get a new one.</li>
    <li> Wow! I used this brush to apply my liquid foundation, and it looked amazing! You can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;m wearing foundation because it blends so seamlessly with my skin, but my face looks flawless! I will be purchasing another to use with my finishing powder!</li>
    <li> My favorite brush for liquid and powder foundation.</li>
    <li> I use this brush to set my foundation with powder, and it works great! It makes the powder go on so smoothly and evenly. Since my powder is translucent, sometimes I just dab a little powder in a certain area, and it blends very well because this brush has a very precise flat surface. It&#x27;s very functional and can be used for many different things. It is a must have.</li>
    <li> This brush was the best, but I just lost it unfortunately. I have to buy another one. If the company wants to send me a new one for free that would be great lol.</li>
    <li> Great stipple brush.... The handle came loose but still hasn&#x27;t fallen out yet. She&#x27;s seen better days.... Maybe it is I&#x27;ve for an upgrade. Over all, I am happy. I&#x27;d rather deal with a loose handle than a brush that sheds hairs in my foundation constantly.</li>
    <li> I love my powder brush its good for powder all over the face .  I havent used it for foundation yet . The powder brush its so soft its not hard at all . I love this brush. I do recommended this brush</li>
    <li> I gave this brush a try based on the positive reviews. Unfortunately, my experience was anything but positive. Everything about this brush was a disappointment. The way it looks, feels, and operates.  The price is what it is because it is junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle ad ferrule are cheaply made. The brush hairs are rough and don&#x27;t pick up color, cream or powder. The application of cream and powder is just terrible. The brush sheds BAD.  I washed the brush twice ti see if performance improved. No improvement, but more hairs lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead if tossing, I now use it as a duster to clean tight spaces.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. I use it for stippling and blending liquid foundation and powder application. I would like to purchase the sigma F80 and real techniques face brush for foundation application and leave this for powder application though. But it works very well &amp; especially for that price. I love the elf studio line.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this brush, she says its just an OK brush for the price. Hope this helps someone. .</li>
    <li> Not  worth the money....especially here, the price is ridiculous. I really do not have a whole lot more to say about the product.</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve been slowly transitioning my Ulta makeup brushes to e.l.f. ones and couldn&#x27;t be happier. My old foundation brush was really starting to wear out, and was shedding bristles by the clump, so out it went. This brush is WONDERFUL. Maybe my skin was just so bummed-out from my scratchy old brush, but in comparison this brush is beyond soft and smooth. I use it for loose powder foundation and have definitely noticed that the powder applies more evenly, which means I&#x27;m using less of it each time to make it look right. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It washes nicely and dries quickly--I wash all my brushes about once a week in the morning, and even this one is dry in about twelve hours. It also doesn&#x27;t leak black dye on my towels, which is always a plus. (Looking at you, Ulta brushes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is a few bucks more expensive than the $3 base price from e.l.f.--but it&#x27;s worth it. The closest place I can buy e.l.f. products is a Target that&#x27;s about a $3 metro ride away, so it actually evens out to be cheaper to order it for $5ish with Prime shipping. All in all, well worth the money either way.</li>
    <li> For the price this brush is great, the quality is as good as those for which I have paid much more.</li>
    <li> i saw a girl using this brush on youtube and she went on about how much she loved it so i decided to give it a try. i had never used a foundation brush before so i was a little nervous overall. i got this brush and it was everything i never knew i needed. its soooooo soft and it gives you nice coverage. i use cover girl matte mousse foundation and the coverage is awesome. you can build it up if you need more coverage in certain areas and it wont be streaky</li>
    <li> I love elf products im not saying its better than all other expensive brands but its up there. I started using makeup but I wanted just a natural look . All my brushes are mostly from elf. This brush is soo soft but still able to pick up liquid and powder foundation and the flat top makes it easy to get under my eyes. I never had any issue with elf product except when I washed it. The handle loosened but I put some glue and kinda shoved it back and now its still good. I wouldn&#x27;t replace it cuz of a lose handle that can be fix when the bristles are so amazing. After all nothing is perfect.</li>
    <li> A must have if you love to contour your face! It works great for powder or foundation.</li>
    <li> Works well for my needs. Brush is soft, haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding.</li>
    <li> This product arrived very fast! It shipped out within hours of placing the order, and got here before the estimated date. The first thing you notice is the softness of the brush, it feels like a cloud or a baby&#x27;s skin. Also the brush is very dense, which is something I was worried about. Another thing I was worried about was shedding, but I don&#x27;t think it has lost a single bristle or hair since I got it. It is a very high quality brush. My makeup goes on flawlessly, and I find myself using less makeup than usual. There is only one problem; the brush holds onto the products I use a little too well making cleaning it a bit difficult. Otherwise the product is perfect, and I am very satisfied!</li>
    <li> one thing though its only $3 on the elf website so i would get it there but in over all its a pretty good product. it helped me alot when  i sstarted getting into my makeup so i hope this helps you</li>
    <li> Great, great, GREAT big flat cosmetic brush!  I use it after I&#x27;ve applied concealer and foundation (either liquid or mineral).  Then I just brush it around my whole face with light-to-(more) moderate pressure.  It gives me an air-brushed look:  smooth and (almost) flawless, without making it obvious I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  I learned this trick on YouTube a couple of years ago, and this super-affordable brush let&#x27;s me do it without making a mess or leaving fibers all over my face.  I&#x27;ve even gotten my mother - the fashion and cosmetic diva that she is - doing it.  And she&#x27;s using her own brush..,I talked her into buying one, and she loves the effect!</li>
    <li> I love this brush so much that I bought a couple of more! It has so many uses and is such a great value! Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> a terrible brush. It sheds and is way too soft. There  better brushes around in about the same price.</li>
    <li> Best brush I ever bought. It doesn&#x27;t shed AT ALL &amp; its great for liquid &amp; powder foundations. I even use it to highlight, contour, add blush, and blend makeup. I love it! It&#x27;s so cheap &amp; it has so many uses. I use it almost every day &amp; I&#x27;ve had it for a little more than a year. Easy to clean too!&lt;br /&gt;May 8th and my brush is still holding up pretty well! I bought this brush maybe two summers ago? The brush handle did become detached from the brush, but I popped it back on, and it&#x27;s fine again! Still my favorite brush! My makeup looks flawless every single time!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Powder. It works great when gliding across your skin smoothly. It&#x27;s definitely a must-have.</li>
    <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve had! Applies my blush and foundation with ease compared to my other brushes. I&#x27;m tempted to order another- one for both.</li>
    <li> I use this brush with the elf blush and bronzer set and it is perfect for contouring your face, it makes it way easier.</li>
    <li> Would definitely recommend this brush. I use it to set my makeup with a mineral powder. I can stamp on the powder or sweep it on. I know a lot of poeple recommend using this to apply foundation but i just felt it was kinda too big for that. I dont like putting my foundation on that way. I always put my eye makeup on first and then put foundation on after because I dont like to go back and redo my makeup from all the eyeshadow fallout. This brush has become a staple for my makeup supplies. I love the way it has super dense but soft application. Plus it&#x27;s super cheap and rivals MACs $30 brushes. Great deal. Even if you&#x27;re not sure how you will use it, get it anyway and i&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll figure out what works best for you.</li>
    <li> Came in a really nice package that included a plastic sleeve to protect the brush when not in use. for the price  think its excellent. i havent experienced any shedding from running my hands through it. it smells like its straight out of the factory too. comes with instructions at the back for use and care. i was gonna try the Sigma 80 but saw rave reviews about this on Youtube and decided to try it at its outrageous $5 price instead of shelling out a whole $20. so far its bristles are soft to the touch yet they are compact enough to give the firmness needed for a nice even spread. i bought this for foundation application and will definitely try it with powder. the handle is 5 inches long AND has a great grip. try it. at $5 bucks u cant go wrong.</li>
    <li> I love my Elf Powder Brush! I don&#x27;t use it for putting on powder or blush but I do use it for my foundation. It makes my foundation go on so great and looks so smooth. It blends onto my face so well and it saves me a lot of time. Will definitely be looking at more Elf Brushes.</li>
    <li> This arrived earlier. I WASH ALL NEW brushes before I use them. I don&#x27;t use this brush for powder. I actual use it for my liquid foundation and it applies my foundation and it looks flawless. I love this brush along with the brushes that I use that are for using liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> amazing brush for the price i use it for foundation and powder.</li>
    <li> Its not a bad brush for the price.. I still prefer my MAC brushes</li>
    <li> I love this brush so much, it&#x27;s my second one! I use it to apply my transparent powder when I&#x27;m oily.</li>
    <li> Ok so i been usig this product with my bare mineral powder and its just starting to shed very badly. I loved this brush so much in the begining but.now.i find it my least favorite.</li>
    <li> This is the best bush you can get for the price. It feels like a $30 brush. Love using it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush. It&#x27;s soft and non-irritating to the skin. I use it to apply foundation and it does a much better job then their foundation brushes. Not as good as my Mac brushes but for under $6 it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> An excellent brush for powder. Love it, use it daily and recommend it to friends. It is much better then other brushes at that price range and one of my two favorite brushes from e.l.f</li>
    <li> Best brush I have ever purchased. Very soft bristles and applies mineral powder foundation smoothly.</li>
    <li> This brush, first off, is great for the price. Only $3 at Target! I got this brush mainly for applying blush. And it works wonderful! My blush doesn&#x27;t look cakey anymore. It goes on super smooth and blends beautifully. And I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work even better for bronzers! I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is the most softest brush i have ever own really good for powder. I am very suprised that it cost that much.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a powder brush but I use it for my liquid foundation. I dab the foundation all over my face, use the brush to blend it out, then go back over my entire face in a light stippling motion. This brush is sooooo soft and fluffy, yet dense enough to hold up to the task of applying and buffing foundation. I&#x27;ve had this for about a week now, and have been trying to wash it out after every use. I really dig into the brush to get it clean and the bristles pop right back into their place as it dries, and keeps its shape with every wash. None of the bristles have come off yet. This is a great brush for such a small price. It&#x27;s $3 at Target!</li>
    <li> I know Elf Brushes are known for their great quality and price, but when I received mine, for whatever reason, I wiped it across my hand and the handle disconnected from the head of the brush. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the seller or if it&#x27;s just a bad brush. Very unhappy with this purchase. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great Brush for powder or liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> I love this  brush... It works sooo good! It&#x27;s been my favorite. The only problem is after a month it starts falling apart, the hairs begin to fall out like crazy. This is the third time i&#x27;ve bought the brush, and all three have done this. Other than that, I really like this brush when applying my foundation. It spreads it evenly :)</li>
    <li> This brush is thick, lots of fibers so you can pretty much use this for anything, foundation, powders, setting powders even blush if you wanted. I primarily use it to apply setting powder over my foundation/bb cream and it does a really good job at picking up powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might want to be careful because sometimes it picks up too much powder and if you&#x27;re not careful you can look a little cakey and dusty. But over all that&#x27;s up to the person, not the brush. Great brush for the price.</li>
    <li> I love dis brush so much that I have 3! It is dense so it is the perfect brush for my liquid foundations. It applies the product beautifully! U can buy dis brush at anyplace that sells elf products(I am aware now).</li>
    <li> I love this brush for blush</li>
    <li> I have three brushes of this kind that I purchased off of the elf website last year (I heard the design may have been modified in the meantime). They are simply AMAZING! (Not to mention they are cheaper there.) None has shed on me, although I&#x27;ve washed them all numerous times, they are soft and they are just great for applying powder, liquid foundation and even blush or bronzer. This is probably one of my favorite elf products which says a lot because I love the brand and I own something like 80% of their huge product line.</li>
    <li> good product, great service!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. The bristles are soft, yet firm. The brush is well made and does not look cheap. Remember to keep the guard that comes with it in order to keep the shape of the brush.  I plan on buying more brushes from elf.</li>
    <li> I love this make up brush! I use it for my bronzer to contour my face and it does a great job of picking up product. I use another e.l.f. powder brush to blend it all out and it works great as well! The bristles are very soft and densely packed, there hasn&#x27;t been any shedding as of right now and it&#x27;s been washed 3 times since purchasing. This is a new staple in my daily makeup routine!</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to getting all of the contents in my package. It was such a disappointment to find the empty package for this brush.</li>
    <li> Like they say you get for what you pay. I thought it was pretty good. It gets the job done, but I dislike That it&#x27;s too soft. I was hoping for something more dense. It wasn&#x27;t the best unfortunately, but for the price of it...iit&#x27;s pretty good. I probably wouldnt buy it again, unless I had to. It&#x27;s cheap so I&#x27;m not really mad about it.</li>
    <li> I typically buy this brush at WalMart of $3 but they never seem to have them in stock so I am glad I found them on Amazon.  It is hands down the ONLY brush I use to apply my liquid foundation.  It works better than any other brush I own from M.A.C to Sigma to Zoeva.  It does not shed at all and blends my foundation flawlessly.</li>
    <li> this brush is dense and soft and it has a nice flat top so it picks up and applies a pretty even coating of pressed setting powder to set foundation and concealer without smudging away your concealing work. can be used by gently pressing on the skin then gently blending when finishes. a great brush for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!!! I use this brush for my Revlon ColorStay liquid foundation.  I use it as a stippling brush and it works great. I get several compliments on how great my foundation looks. It blends my foundation out beautifully.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this brush from here cause you can get it for 3 bucks at Target.  But I have several Elf brushes and they are all great!!!</li>
    <li> I really had high expectations for these brushes but after I received them I noticed how soft the bristles are on the stippling brush. Too soft to use with liquid foundations. Both brushes are deformed flat one one side and I&#x27;ve tried everything to reform them back into a round form. Also the smell of the brushes them-selves is ridiculously awful... The packages were taped shut w/ clear tape (WHO DOES THAT)??? Maybe some1 bought them b4 and returned them IDK. I gave it 1 star for the shipping time. I ordered the Monday and got them today.(Thursday)</li>
    <li> I was Looking for a powder brush , and this brush was a great choice the bristles are very soft . I love it and I totally recommend it , cheap &amp; good at the same time</li>
    <li> This was an amazing brush that I used for everything, everyday. But after about 3 cleanings, clumps of bristles would fall off and I could literally just pull them out with ease. Very sad but at least it&#x27;s cheap and you get what you pay for. A very good temporary brush to use for foundations for a flawless finish look.</li>
    <li> I use this brush every day to apply liquid foundation. I&#x27;ve cleaned it several times and it has never shed. It is dense and soft and does a FANTASTIC job. It&#x27;s comparable to (if not better than) higher end brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to compare it to my It brush from the velvet line at Ulta. e.l.f is vegan and cruelty free which i lOve. The taklon synthetic bristles are so soft. I paid $3.00 for this brush at Walmart and $38.00 for It velvet line brush at Ulta. I like both brushes and the only difference besides price is that the e.l.f  bristles are longer and the handle rubber grip is a little less sturdy. I am very impressed with e.l.f. The It brush bristles are more dense&amp;compact. They almost look identical. It has soft bristles,no fall out or shedding. Perfect for the$ and gets the job well done.. When on a budget i buy these&amp; also to take for travel use. If i lose them i won&#x27;t be too disappointed and can afford more at this rate. Buy e.lf. and save $$$!</li>
