### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome product.</li>
      <li>I hope you never stop stocking this excellent product</li>
      <li>The best product I have found!</li>
      <li>This is the best hairstyling product I have ever used!</li>
      <li>Awesome product  and washes out like a dream</li>
      <li>I was introduced to it at the salon and 2000 and it works beautifully In my Find hair.</li>
      <li>This is a great hair product.</li>
      <li>And yes, chicks dig guys with great hair.</li>
      <li>It holds my style great.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great.</li>
      <li>A wonderful product that is just what I need for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>however, is amazing.</li>
      <li>Most products like American Crew Fiber or Gatsby Spiking Glue are great for the majority of guys out there, but they would always deceive me, looking great</li>
      <li>Love this stuff...</li>
      <li>And so do guys if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing. :)</li>
      <li>I can no longer buy this at a salon, so I am so glad that I can still purchase this online.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair product.  </li>
      <li>have used this product and love it.  </li>
      <li>An easy counter</li>
      <li>This is absolutely the best product for styling very fine, flat hair.</li>
      <li>It is great for spiking short hair.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m excited to find it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many more compliments after spending under a minute styling with this product, than I have after spending 5-10 minutes using a different brand of wax or pomade.</li>
      <li>Other than those two minor complaints, I can safely say that this is THE BEST product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>Kind of smells like a normal glue, which is fitting, but kinda strange for some people as well.</li>
      <li>They recently changed the formula which makes the product more smooth.  </li>
      <li>It still looked good, but I was not content considering the amount of money I&#x27;d spent on them.&lt;br /&gt;XTG</li>
      <li>As someone who has very fine hair, and a lot of it, this product is the only one (of the 15 or so I&#x27;ve tried) that effectively gives my hair lasting hold.</li>
      <li>I have a short somewhat messy doo and it works great!  </li>
      <li>This is only felt by your hands when touching it.</li>
      <li>the first 10 minutes</li>
      <li>It allows you to &#x27;make&#x27; your hair do exactly what you want it to do quickly and without any particular skill.  </li>
      <li>However, with my long straight hair, it works more like a clay than a paste.</li>
      <li>look because it really doesn&#x27;t look like you have any product in.</li>
      <li>Much better than ice or other products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had my hair stylist remark that she is surprised I use this product as it&#x27;s typical use is for very detailed shaping and styling.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll really give you that  &amp;#34;My hair just naturally looks this good&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use hardly any at one time to achieve a strong hold, and 3.4 ounces is already a pretty high volume for a hair product like this.</li>
      <li>I live where the humidity is a problem.  </li>
      <li>holds fine, thin hair for the day and makes you feel like you have a full head of hair.</li>
      <li>I had them in for, and then becoming way too heavy and pulling my hair down into a slanted flat top.</li>
      <li>so I was pleasantly surprised to find it here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>For anyone who wants to keep your hair out of your face, it is a terrific product.</li>
      <li>My hair is thin and baby fine and Paul Mitchell Lab XTG</li>
      <li>if this really bugs you is to just put on a little cologne or even a stronger deodorant.</li>
      <li>This stuff holds like no other, and without the need of spending a long time styling.</li>

    <li> Love this stuff...it works in all types of weather and a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> The best....could not live without it!</li>
    <li> I found this product after a recommendation from a friend.  It allows you to &#x27;make&#x27; your hair do exactly what you want it to do quickly and without any particular skill.  For anyone who wants to keep your hair out of your face, it is a terrific product.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairstyling product I have ever used! I was introduced to it at the salon and 2000 and it works beautifully In my Find hair.

It has become hard to find over the years so I&#x27;m excited to find it here on Amazon. I hope you never stop stocking this excellent product</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best product for styling very fine, flat hair. Once you learn how it handles and sets you can do anything with your hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom. she has very very short hair and she likes to spike and this product&lt;br /&gt;does the job without make it to stiff..</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE ONLY HAIR GLUE SHE WILL USE.  GLUE IS A BIT PRICEY.  ONE BOTTLE LASTS HER APPROXIMATELY 2 MONTHS.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my hair stylist remark that she is surprised I use this product as it&#x27;s typical use is for very detailed shaping and styling.  However, with my long straight hair, it works more like a clay than a paste.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY product that works for my hair. My hair is thin and baby fine and Paul Mitchell Lab XTG Extreme thickening Glue gives it body and is manageable for the style I have. The best product I have found!</li>
    <li> As someone who has very fine hair, and a lot of it, this product is the only one (of the 15 or so I&#x27;ve tried) that effectively gives my hair lasting hold. Most products like American Crew Fiber or Gatsby Spiking Glue are great for the majority of guys out there, but they would always deceive me, looking great the first 10 minutes I had them in for, and then becoming way too heavy and pulling my hair down into a slanted flat top. It still looked good, but I was not content considering the amount of money I&#x27;d spent on them.&lt;br /&gt;XTG however, is amazing. This stuff holds like no other, and without the need of spending a long time styling. It works for spiking or just adding height and texture into your cut. I might have the largest sheer amount of hair of any guys I know, and XTG gives me a solid hold throughout the entirety of the day. Not only this, but this stuff will last you a LONG time. Like over 4 months per bottle. You don&#x27;t need to use hardly any at one time to achieve a strong hold, and 3.4 ounces is already a pretty high volume for a hair product like this. The cost is pretty low, and considering you&#x27;ll probably get between 2-3 bottles a year, you&#x27;ll end up spending way less than you would with almost any other hair product. The ONLY cons for me with this product are completely personal, and are menial enough to not affect the 5-star rating. The smell isn&#x27;t great. It&#x27;s not bad by any means, but it&#x27;s not good either. Kind of smells like a normal glue, which is fitting, but kinda strange for some people as well. An easy counter if this really bugs you is to just put on a little cologne or even a stronger deodorant. Note that I&#x27;ve had my share of make-out sessions while wearing this stuff, and the smell was never noticed by my gf so it may just be me. The only other con is that it definitely gives your hair a bit of a sticky feeling. This is only felt by your hands when touching it. This kinda annoys me as I like to run my hand through my hair, and this doesn&#x27;treally allow me to do that. Other than those two minor complaints, I can safely say that this is THE BEST product I&#x27;ve ever used! It&#x27;ll really give you that  &amp;#34;My hair just naturally looks this good&amp;#34; look because it really doesn&#x27;t look like you have any product in. I&#x27;ve gotten so many more compliments after spending under a minute styling with this product, than I have after spending 5-10 minutes using a different brand of wax or pomade. And yes, chicks dig guys with great hair. And so do guys if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing. :)</li>
    <li> A wonderful product that is just what I need for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I received it on time and I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  I have a short somewhat messy doo and it works great!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Its the only one I have found that works in my thick hair. Awesome product. Hard to find here in town.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product since 2004....holds fine, thin hair for the day and makes you feel like you have a full head of hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, course and some curl.  This product is a life saver.  I live where the humidity is a problem.  I put a little in the palm of my hand with a bit of water, rub between both hands to thin and rub all over my hair.  Then use a pick to style.  Hope you never quit stocking this product!</li>
    <li> I can no longer buy this at a salon, so I am so glad that I can still purchase this online.  This is a great hair product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product.  It holds my style great.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been using this XTG glue for several years.  They recently changed the formula which makes the product more smooth.  It is great for spiking short hair.  Does not flake off like some other products that make you look like you have dandruff.  It is hard to find so I was pleasantly surprised to find it here on Amazon.  Lasts all day - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Much better than ice or other products.</li>
