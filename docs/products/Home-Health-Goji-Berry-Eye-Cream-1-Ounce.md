      <li>The scent is pleasant and not over-bearing at all.  </li>
      <li>You ever order something so reasonable considering how awesome it is, then you dont want to say how good it is because others will buy it and the price might go up effecting you?</li>
      <li>If your concerns are wrinkles make sure you use a good peptide serum with a vitamin A derivative.</li>
      <li>Excellent packaging and fast delivery service.</li>
      <li>I just hope I can find another use for it, as I don&#x27;t enjoy wearing it on my eyes!  </li>
      <li>Most of my usage is in the am.  </li>
      <li>My skin looks and feels healthy.</li>
      <li>but most of this is preventative for me.</li>
      <li>This product causes my eyes to sting even for an hour or more after application.  </li>
      <li>Like so many eye creams, this one makes my eyes burn.</li>
      <li>But for now, I gotta say I LOVE this cream.  </li>
      <li>but you are getting twice as much as most brands.</li>
      <li>I use the Himalaya and the Home Health Goji Berry in the morning before I apply make-up, and I love the combo.</li>
      <li>I love this product and will continue to buy.</li>
      <li>however, I wanted to give it a chance and wanted to love it, but I cannot recommend.  </li>
      <li>It really is a great, affordable eye cream that I highly recommend using.</li>
      <li>I recommend to eat Goji Berry&#x27;s as well if you are interested in more than just &#x27;looks&#x27;! :)</li>
      <li>love how rich this is.</li>
      <li>However, if I dab lightly around the eye (orbital bone area) then I&#x27;m fine.</li>
      <li>it rubs in smoothly and it causes no irritation.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, all natural ingredients and simple skin care.</li>
      <li>It applies so easily and is quickly absorbed.  </li>
      <li>and this is the only thing I have found that not only works but is awesome.</li>
      <li>Otherwise it performs more or less okay as an eye cream, though I don&#x27;t enjoy the \\&quot;tightening\\&quot; (firming?) sensation.  </li>
      <li>I love this eye cream, my sensitive skin loves it, and so does my wallet when I get it here at Amazon.</li>
      <li>It just sits on the skin without being absorbed.  </li>
      <li>In addition, their is more eye cream in this jar than most other brands.</li>
      <li>With winter right around the corner, this product should do well.</li>
      <li>and I really noticed how my skin is dry and how my light wrinkles are more visible.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this eye cream, nearly consistently since 2011.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more of this when I run out.  </li>
      <li>I like that it is not expensive and does the job.</li>
      <li>And it is natural, free of paraben and fragrance.</li>
      <li>Cream kinda of smells funny</li>
      <li>The products provides very good moisture to the delicate skin of the under eye area; always a tough area for any product to show good results.</li>
      <li>I purchased this eye cream a couple of months ago, and since using it -- I have noticed that the dark circles under my eyes have improved significantly!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for a few years and love it!</li>
      <li>So after using it for 4 to 5 months, I didn&#x27;t see much results.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>- very creamy (leaves my eyes very moisturized)&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a moisturizing, hydrating face and eye cream and really wanted this to work.</li>
      <li>I am 41 years of age, and have used a variety of products on the market (mostly popular brand names) over the past six or seven years.</li>
      <li>Either the formula has changed or this sample is more &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34; and less creamy and nourishing.</li>
      <li>I have tried a number of products from min price to high end.</li>
      <li>I found this product on this site, because I have very sensitive skin, and need to use products that do not contain fragrance...</li>
      <li>It is the first eye cream that I have used that I can actually feel working.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m glad to find a product that isn&#x27;t just a cover up; it actually helps reduce the look of puffiness and dark circles.</li>
      <li>So I stopped using it and waited for it to clear up.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a cheaper, natural alternative to Clinique.</li>
      <li>, don&#x27;t want him thinking I smell like an old lady.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s non greasy and does NOT have an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; smell.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this does not bother my skin at all.</li>
      <li>Obviously I have not been very \\&quot;wowed\\&quot; and will be on the lookout for nicer eye creams to try.</li>
      <li>I love thick, creamy eye creams that make me feel like its working.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy when it first goes on but has an odd &#x27;non&#x27; odor if that&#x27;s even possible.</li>
      <li>Also, it does sting my eyes a little but not that much.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s so much for how little you use.</li>

<li> There&#x27;s so much for how little you use.</li>
<li> &gt;  - one container lasts at least 6 months (maybe more) -- a little goes a long way</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product for long, and later will come back and comment on its anti-aging properties.  </li>
<li> In first few weeks of using it, I got a pink eye.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s an odor with no perfume and yet it has some strange odor just the same.</li>
<li> I can see this at least being a decent basic eye cream.</li>
<li> This product works well so long as you use it in the morning and at night before going to bed.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 26 years old and have huge, deep set eyes and the skin underneath is very thin which makes me look tired all the time.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to hydrate at all, pills up a little and then later my eye area just felt dry.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m only 26 and have a few spots to worry about</li>
<li> It seems to detract from any moisturizing benefit the product might provide, since dry skin tends to feel tight, etc etc.   </li>
<li> the dark circles around my eyes have diminished.  </li>
<li> I use maybe 1/3rd to half of a pea size.</li>
<li> I agree with a previous poster that it can cause eye irritation if you get it too close to your eyes.</li>
<li> Typically eye creams are .5 oz.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for a little while now and don&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
<li> I was hoping this product would lighten up my dark circles and help diminish the small lines around my eyes.  </li>
<li> so Im set for a few years</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a little over a year now, and the (very slight) wrinkles around my eyes have been fading and smoothing out.  </li>
<li> I usually suffer from dryness on my eyelids, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with that since I started using the Goji Berry cream.  </li>
<li> I hardly noticed any results.</li>
<li> this product was dry, didnt absorb into skin, and was so thick like a paste, hate it, dont waste your money!!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s irritating.  </li>
<li> Just not impressed.  </li>
<li> This is the worst eye cream I ever tried.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for a little while now and don&#x27;t notice a difference. Cream kinda of smells funny, so I don&#x27;t put it on when I know my husband will kiss me, don&#x27;t want him thinking I smell like an old lady.  Just not impressed.  Neutral but wouldn&#x27;t guy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 26 years old and have huge, deep set eyes and the skin underneath is very thin which makes me look tired all the time. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up so I&#x27;m glad to find a product that isn&#x27;t just a cover up; it actually helps reduce the look of puffiness and dark circles. This product works well so long as you use it in the morning and at night before going to bed. It&#x27;s non greasy and does NOT have an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I bought this. There&#x27;s so much for how little you use. I use maybe 1/3rd to half of a pea size. It leaves my under eye area so moisturized. I haven&#x27;t seen any signs yet if it&#x27;s eliminating wrinkles or helping to fight signs of aging. I have some very tiny lines under my eyes though and haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet. I&#x27;m only 26 and have a few spots to worry about but most of this is preventative for me. I can see this at least being a decent basic eye cream.</li>
    <li> It is my second order of this product. Actually I am out of it for over 10 days now and I really noticed how my skin is dry and how my light wrinkles are more visible. I can&#x27;t wait to receive my cream. This product gives the feeling of lifting and tighten your under eye skin.And it is natural, free of paraben and fragrance. I really love it!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product for long, and later will come back and comment on its anti-aging properties.  But for now, I gotta say I LOVE this cream.  I just started using it in conjunction with the Himalaya Undereye Cream.  I use the Himalaya and the Home Health Goji Berry in the morning before I apply make-up, and I love the combo. I use the Home Health alone at night.  It applies so easily and is quickly absorbed.  The scent is pleasant and not over-bearing at all.  It&#x27;s like a drink of water for the skin around my eyes.  I usually suffer from dryness on my eyelids, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with that since I started using the Goji Berry cream.  I will definitely be buying more of this when I run out.  My eyes have already thanked me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review at a later time to comment on the anti-aging effects!</li>
    <li> I am 41 years of age, and have used a variety of products on the market (mostly popular brand names) over the past six or seven years. I had never noticed a difference until I began using this eye cream.  I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a little over a year now, and the (very slight) wrinkles around my eyes have been fading and smoothing out.  Mind you, I am the biggest skeptic out there. But I actually do notice a difference!&lt;br /&gt;Pros - odorless&lt;br /&gt;  - very creamy (leaves my eyes very moisturized)&lt;br /&gt;  - one container lasts at least 6 months (maybe more) -- a little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;  - does not irritate my eyes at all!&lt;br /&gt;Cons - NONE!</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream, my sensitive skin loves it, and so does my wallet when I get it here at Amazon. Excellent product, all natural ingredients and simple skin care.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream I have ever used.The price is great! I would recomend this to anyone.It is the first eye cream that I have used that I can actually feel working.</li>
    <li> this product was dry, didnt absorb into skin, and was so thick like a paste, hate it, dont waste your money!!</li>
    <li> This is the worst eye cream I ever tried.  It&#x27;s drying.  It&#x27;s irritating.  It just sits on the skin without being absorbed.  I sent mine back.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 3 weeks now daily.  Most of my usage is in the am.  Maybe I should use both days for a while to see results.  I like that it does moisturize the eye area.</li>
    <li> Like so many eye creams, this one makes my eyes burn. The only one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t sting is Clinique. I was looking for a cheaper, natural alternative to Clinique. This isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> This product causes my eyes to sting even for an hour or more after application.  Otherwise it performs more or less okay as an eye cream, though I don&#x27;t enjoy the \\&quot;tightening\\&quot; (firming?) sensation.  It seems to detract from any moisturizing benefit the product might provide, since dry skin tends to feel tight, etc etc.   I just hope I can find another use for it, as I don&#x27;t enjoy wearing it on my eyes!  Obviously I have not been very \\&quot;wowed\\&quot; and will be on the lookout for nicer eye creams to try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a moisturizing, hydrating face and eye cream and really wanted this to work.

Doesn&#x27;t seem to hydrate at all, pills up a little and then later my eye area just felt dry.</li>
    <li> My skin likes this product. I like that it is not expensive and does the job. My skin looks and feels healthy. I like to keep anything I put on my skin as simple as possible. Goji berry&#x27;s are a great source of anti oxidants and therefore help the skin renewing. I recommend to eat Goji Berry&#x27;s as well if you are interested in more than just &#x27;looks&#x27;! :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this eye cream a couple of months ago, and since using it -- I have noticed that the dark circles under my eyes have improved significantly!! I had no idea that this product contained Vitamin K until I recently saw it listed on the label. Vitamin K is great for under-eye circles. This cream also has diminished the wrinkles I&#x27;ve had on the skin under my eyes. The cream has a nice consistency too! I really am happy I found this product on this site, because I have very sensitive skin, and need to use products that do not contain fragrance...This cream is Fragrance-free and Paraben-Free!! It really is a great, affordable eye cream that I highly recommend using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye cream, nearly consistently since 2011. I agree with a previous poster that it can cause eye irritation if you get it too close to your eyes. However, if I dab lightly around the eye (orbital bone area) then I&#x27;m fine. You shouldn&#x27;t apply eye cream too close to the eye anyway. The cream, as it absorbs, will reach that area and gravitate upwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how rich this is. I would say it is very similar in texture to Bobbi Brown&#x27;s hydrating eye cream but at a fraction of the price. It allows my concealer to glide on well. In addition, their is more eye cream in this jar than most other brands. Typically eye creams are .5 oz. and this is 1 oz, so not only is it a low price but you are getting twice as much as most brands. I will continue to buy this brand of eye cream. If your concerns are wrinkles make sure you use a good peptide serum with a vitamin A derivative.</li>
    <li> Either the formula has changed or this sample is more &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34; and less creamy and nourishing.</li>
    <li> Excellent packaging and fast delivery service. No issues whatsoever. The products provides very good moisture to the delicate skin of the under eye area; always a tough area for any product to show good results. With winter right around the corner, this product should do well. Thanks.</li>
    <li> this product is great.  the dark circles around my eyes have diminished.  it rubs in smoothly and it causes no irritation.</li>
    <li> I love thick, creamy eye creams that make me feel like its working.  This product doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  I suppose I should have known because of the price however, I wanted to give it a chance and wanted to love it, but I cannot recommend.  Also, it does sting my eyes a little but not that much.  I would not purchase again.  On to the next eye cream search!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this eye cream because !) It wasn&#x27;t in a tube and 2) when it gets to your eyes it stings!</li>
    <li> So after using it for 4 to 5 months, I didn&#x27;t see much results. I was hoping this product would lighten up my dark circles and help diminish the small lines around my eyes.  In first few weeks of using it, I got a pink eye. So I stopped using it and waited for it to clear up. The second attempt of using this cream was for about four months. I hardly noticed any results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for a few years and love it! I have sensitive skin and this does not bother my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of products from min price to high end. I love this product and will continue to buy. You can feel your skin tighten when you apply the cream</li>
    <li> You ever order something so reasonable considering how awesome it is, then you dont want to say how good it is because others will buy it and the price might go up effecting you? LOL! I have allergies to perfumes and my eyes are allergic to almost everything and this is the only thing I have found that not only works but is awesome. I bought 3 pkgs. They dont expire until 2015 so Im set for a few years im case everyones reads this. I wouldnt buy anything else.</li>
