### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best part?</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Very good product for skin tone.</li>
      <li>Hence, we welcome:  Water, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Niacinamide, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Polyethylene, Pentylene Glycol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Acetyl Glucosamine, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine, Panthenol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Isohexadecane, Aminomethyl Propanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Squalane, Dimethiconol, Stearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 80, Allantoin, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Acrylates/C10-30</li>
      <li>Great for using at night.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall - this is a good offering by Olay which does tend to brighten and even skin tone with repeated use.</li>
      <li>There are some good and not so good features of this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer</li>
      <li>This is a good night-time moisturizer.</li>
      <li>To reduce sun or age spots, I think you would have to use this cream as part of a regimen, including a good sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and she was always very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Except for the smell, I liked Pro-X.</li>
      <li>it goes on nicely.  </li>
      <li>I have always liked Oil of Olay products.  </li>
      <li>In the mornings when it is used, my skin seems dryer and blotchier kind of, I would have to say.</li>
      <li>She reports that it does a nice job of moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I liked the way it smoothed into my skin smoothed out the texture of my skin.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels warm and tingly immediately after application.</li>
      <li>It has a very mild scent that is fairly pleasant.</li>
      <li>Seems like an excellent product so far.</li>
      <li>Very light, and silky, with no fragrance at all.</li>
      <li>I have a condition called melasma, in which darker pigmented areas are scattered over very light skin.  </li>
      <li>I have very fair and sensitive skin, and Olay&#x27;s Even Tone has helped with the redness I sometimes get on my cheeks and nose.</li>
      <li>The tone of my skin is looking better also but that is something I will have to confirm after using for a month</li>
      <li>I love the consistency and feel of this “cream.”</li>
      <li>This nighttime moisturizer is okay</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using this Olay Pro-X, and I&#x27;ll be sticking with it.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Olay Pro-X Even Skin Tone Brightening Renewal Cream for about a week at this point, and I really do love it.  </li>
      <li>and I think it holds promise, but more from a moisturizing standpoint than a Spot fading cream.</li>
      <li>Made my skin better, cleared it up.</li>
      <li>It feels more like lotion.</li>
      <li>What I love is that there&#x27;s no greasy T-zone after application, and the ruddiness of winter is gone.</li>
      <li>But the product inside is lovely.</li>
      <li>so we are able to get some use out of it</li>
      <li>Too many night creams leave me with the feeling that I have a film over my skin.</li>
      <li>My skin does feel softer but the breakout will probably prevent me from using more of it.</li>
      <li>This cream purports to help renew skin surface for a brighter, more even skin tone.  </li>
      <li>No perfume-y scent (LOVE that), and</li>
      <li>not so I was mostly trying this product to see how well my skin handled shaving scars because I saw another user who commented it worked for them.</li>
      <li>Lovely.  </li>
      <li>’s a great light slightly scented yet effective moisturizer with the added benefits of reducing my hyper-pigmentation that is a great foundation for my make-up regime.</li>
      <li>It is very light and fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>This is a very good facial cream--not oily at all</li>
      <li>Instead it feels like my skin is absorbing the light lotion, a sure sign of a good hydrating cream.</li>
      <li>Olay the brand generally makes great products and this one is no exception.</li>
      <li>This is a smooth cream that goes on easily.</li>
      <li>For home use, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>so I could see myself buying this and the price being justified.  </li>
      <li>At night, after cleaning my skin I use a couple of dabs of the cream, which is smooth and silky going on.</li>
      <li>There are plenty of products available in glass or #2 plastic which is preferable.</li>
      <li>cream doesn&#x27;t have the signature Olay scent, which is good news for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It’s light and smooths on quickly and easily.  </li>
      <li>I have use every kind of moisturizer, serum, Vitamin A and C cream, BB and CC creams, and I must say that Oil of Olay is always right up there with the higher end products.  </li>
      <li>Luckily my skin was fine</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the annoyances of others I&#x27;ve tried: it&#x27;s fragrance-free; it has a rich texture yet applies evenly; and it doesn&#x27;t contain any ingredients that irritate my skin or eyes.</li>
      <li>I liked this new formula.  </li>
      <li>Though the scent is light and fades quickly after application I don’t like it.  </li>
      <li>So far, I really love this!  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not as good as Total Effects.</li>
      <li>I love the feel of the cream going on my face, very soothing</li>
      <li>so she quickly removed it.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly.</li>
      <li>Overall it’s still a nice light moisturizer however.</li>
      <li>, so I really know that I&#x27;ve put it on my face, plus I feel it -- almost like a sting, but that is too strong of a word -- as I put it</li>
      <li>Based upon my own experience, I definitely recommend this Olay product.</li>
      <li>so it was a nice opportunity to potentially deal with some of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and my face is so soft and smooth when I get up in the morning!  </li>
      <li>My skin is somewhat sensitive, though I can use most lotions without any problems.  </li>
      <li>For it&#x27;s price, it&#x27;s worth to try it.</li>
      <li>of my issues is redness on my cheeks, and not in the nice Snow White way.</li>
      <li>I have been putting this on each night right before I go to bed</li>
      <li>I recommend, as we&#x27;re trying this one right now, the three part treatment if you chose to use this product and sticking with it for 8 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It feels very cool and soft when you apply it.</li>
      <li>When it comes to high quality and reasonable price that is backed by some of the best skincare research teams, the Olay brand is hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>The Olay Pro-X Even Skin Tone Brightening Renewal Cream is an OK moisturizer, poor to fair at improving the tone of your skin.  </li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it is advertised to do.</li>
      <li>They were one of the first products to introduce a moisturizer with an SPF.  </li>
      <li>Granted, on the box it suggests you use this after first applying their spot treatment serum, which I do not have and did know</li>
      <li>This cream reads like a lotion because it absorbs into the skin without leaving a greasy residue often left by many “creams”.</li>
      <li>The Olay Pro-X Even Skin Tone Brightening Renewal Cream actually seemed to lighten and brighten my lighter colored areas first, leaving the melasma even more noticeable.  </li>
      <li>I feel a tingling feeling when I first apply it, but there is no redness or rash.  </li>
      <li>This is the first of the Olay Pro-X I have used</li>
      <li>The first couple of days, I didn&#x27;t notice anything, but after a week, the changes were noticeable in the morning when I woke.</li>
      <li>My skin does feel nice right after applying it, but it doesn&#x27;t stay as soft in the morning as my Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Night Firming Treatment.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a very lightweight cream with absolutely no scent, with which I am thrilled.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to apply and it doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue</li>
      <li>Practically scentless, what scent there is really is just kind of typical skin cream scent.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say anything to the &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; claim, but it certainly moisturizes effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also claims to smooth skin texture with nourishing hydration and reduce the look of dull skin for a smoother, more even skin tone.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed much, if any, improvement in age spots since using this.  </li>
      <li>Keep in mind that the body&#x27;s largest organ is the skin and that it is very porous.</li>
      <li>I have not seen much difference in evening out my skin tone though.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
      <li>I really like how the product feels on my skin.</li>
      <li>Fast result.</li>
      <li>I absolutely notice fresher, smoother, younger-feeling skin since using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference in my skin tone.</li>
      <li>My face is feeling smoother, and I notice a real difference in the frown lines between my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>We know those miracle claims aren&#x27;t real.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak for the even skin tone effects, as I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good product for skin tone. Fast result.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have to say that I have very sensitive skin, so I was a little fearful of how I would react to this product.  Surprisingly, it didn&#x27;t bother me in the least and left my skin feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as brightening my skin....I have mixed feelings.  I have a condition called melasma, in which darker pigmented areas are scattered over very light skin.  As soon as I step out into the sun, the melasma darkens, leaving me with a brown mustache and sideburns.  Lovely.  The Olay Pro-X Even Skin Tone Brightening Renewal Cream actually seemed to lighten and brighten my lighter colored areas first, leaving the melasma even more noticeable.  Over the last week, though, I have noticed that the melasma also seems to be lightening a little.  My skin is nowhere near matching, just overall lighter now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions:  For now, I would have to say that this brightening cream does in fact work, but only continued use will tell whether it will work to bring my skin tones closer to matching.  It would certainly work for people who just want an overall lightening effect.  I will try to update my review once I&#x27;ve used the entire jar.</li>
    <li> Olay&#x27;s Pro-X seemed to even out my skin tone, even the blotchy marks from acne scars, which I didn&#x27;t expect.  My skin also seems brighter looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I marked it down a star because the product claims to be fragrance free, but I definitely detected the strong smell of alcohol.  Except for the smell, I liked Pro-X.</li>
    <li> There are some good and not so good features of this product.  It’s light and smooths on quickly and easily.  I’m prone to allergic reactions and suffered none with this brightening renewal cr&amp;egrave;me.  Though the scent is light and fades quickly after application I don’t like it.  It reminds of the smell of some hair removal lotions.  One of the features is supposed to be a lessoning of skin dark patches and I didn’t notice that it acted in this way.  Overall it’s still a nice light moisturizer however.</li>
    <li> The Olay Pro-X Even Skin Tone Brightening Renewal Cream is an OK moisturizer, poor to fair at improving the tone of your skin.  My facial skin is pretty clear, with one or two brown spots. I am prone to dry skin, especially in the winter, and I&#x27;ve tried a variety of moisturizers. The positives of this cream is that it is very lightly scented, and it absorbs into your skin in just a few minutes, without any greasy feel.  To reduce sun or age spots, I think you would have to use this cream as part of a regimen, including a good sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative if this cream is that it is in a thick, plastic, non-recycleable jar. There are plenty of products available in glass or #2 plastic which is preferable.</li>
    <li> I had to give this to my wife to use, as I don&#x27;t personally use products like this. She reports that it does a nice job of moisturizing. One of the advertised \\&quot;features\\&quot; of this product is it&#x27;s claim to \\&quot;Even skin tone\\&quot;. She doesn&#x27;t have uneven skin tones, so we can&#x27;t report on the success of that claim.</li>
    <li> This nighttime moisturizer is okay but it&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve used. It feels very cool and soft when you apply it. There&#x27;s no fragrance that I can smell. The consistency is a bit odd. It&#x27;s thicker than a lotion but not as thick as a cream. You have to use VERY light coverage with it because if you put it on too thick it gets gooey -- you can rub it off with your fingers. Yuck! My skin does feel nice right after applying it, but it doesn&#x27;t stay as soft in the morning as my Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Night Firming Treatment. I didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference in my skin tone. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer but it&#x27;s not as good as Total Effects.</li>
    <li> This is a good night-time moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t have the annoyances of others I&#x27;ve tried: it&#x27;s fragrance-free; it has a rich texture yet applies evenly; and it doesn&#x27;t contain any ingredients that irritate my skin or eyes. I can&#x27;t really say anything to the &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; claim, but it certainly moisturizes effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one quibble is the jar lid, which feels loose even when screwed on all the way. If I ever traveled with this stuff, I&#x27;d worry about it bursting open. For home use, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed much, if any, improvement in age spots since using this.  If there is any improvement, it&#x27;s very slight.  I do like the fact that it leaves my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t make me break out, as some moisturizers do.  However, I would not recommend this for age spots.  I also don&#x27;t like the fact that Olay has a zillion products claiming to improve signs of aging, including age spots.  It&#x27;s very confusing to know what the differences are between them, and the ones I have tried don&#x27;t really seem to work.</li>
    <li> I applied this cream every day for over a week and a half and did not notice any change in my age spots, or even the look of my skin overall.  I wanted to apply it every day for longer, but I started to have some type of allergic reaction to it and so stopped using it.  My skin is somewhat sensitive, though I can use most lotions without any problems.  This cream did make my skin soft, but it wasn&#x27;t much different from when I apply lotion everyday in the winter.</li>
    <li> After all the information provided by the manufacturer and other reviewers, what can I say about the Olay Pro-X Even Skin Tone Brightening Renewal Cream.&lt;br /&gt;It’s a great light slightly scented yet effective moisturizer with the added benefits of reducing my hyper-pigmentation that is a great foundation for my make-up regime. This cream reads like a lotion because it absorbs into the skin without leaving a greasy residue often left by many “creams”. Olay the brand generally makes great products and this one is no exception. I definitely recommend this product which will remain a staple in my skin care.</li>
    <li> This is one part of a skin regimen offered by Olay.  It moisturizes well especially if one uses it consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Non-greasy, non-allergenic(at least for us) with a nice consistency and smell that goes on daily.  In general, we like the Olay products including using a mask.  I recommend, as we&#x27;re trying this one right now, the three part treatment if you chose to use this product and sticking with it for 8 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, we haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of lightening but skin texture appears smoother and less dry with healing on the small dryness cracks around eyes and lips.  We live in the high Colorado sunny and dry climate.</li>
    <li> Olay PROx Brightening Renewal Cream does deliver on the promise to brighten and hydrate skin. I have not seen much difference in evening out my skin tone though. I have fair to ruddy skin with a few small age spots starting to develop. I had hoped to at least soften the edges of demarcation, but no. Granted, on the box it suggests you use this after first applying their spot treatment serum, which I do not have and did know was suggested when I ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a real difference in the overall appearance of my skin. It actually is brighter and clearer-looking. The big deal is how dewy and moist it is looking. My aging skin has been looking duller and just plain flat. To me, the texture and color is improving, slowly but it is real. My face is feeling smoother, and I notice a real difference in the frown lines between my eyebrows. I&#x27;m not saying this is a miracle cream. The lines are still there. We know those miracle claims aren&#x27;t real. But I see a difference, and that&#x27;s what counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very lightweight cream with absolutely no scent, with which I am thrilled. I have sensitive skin so I must be careful when using products.  It absorbs into your skin instantly. There is no gooey or sticky residue. There is a thin film on the skin which does finally disappear in about 30 minutes. I feel a tingling feeling when I first apply it, but there is no redness or rash.  It is suggested for night time use only, but I&#x27;ve been using it on days around the house when I don&#x27;t need sunscreen or makeup.</li>
    <li> Don’t be misled by the word “cream” in this product. It feels more like lotion. I love the consistency and feel of this “cream.” Very light, and silky, with no fragrance at all. Too many night creams leave me with the feeling that I have a film over my skin. Not with this product. Instead it feels like my skin is absorbing the light lotion, a sure sign of a good hydrating cream. I have extremely sensitive skin but I don’t notice any side effects from daily use of this product. My skin feels warm and tingly immediately after application. After one week my skin feels smoother.</li>
    <li> This is a very good facial cream--not oily at all and it does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> In the past, friends have recommended Olay products to me, but after using them, I didn&#x27;t see the improvements they promised and so I threw them away. Not so with Olay&#x27;s new Pro-X line. I have been using Olay&#x27;s Even Skin Tone Brightening Renewal Cream for over a week and have seen an improvement in the tone and texture of my skin. At night, after cleaning my skin I use a couple of dabs of the cream, which is smooth and silky going on. The first couple of days, I didn&#x27;t notice anything, but after a week, the changes were noticeable in the morning when I woke. I have very fair and sensitive skin, and Olay&#x27;s Even Tone has helped with the redness I sometimes get on my cheeks and nose. The best part? My skin feels moisturized and supple. Now I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because it does leave my skin a little oily in the mornings, but compared to the benefits, that&#x27;s an easy fix. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have used Oily of Olay since I was 17.  They were one of the first products to introduce a moisturizer with an SPF.  I have always liked Oil of Olay products.  They are a lower cost product than others but work just as well.  So, when I saw that Olay had Pro-X Skin Tone Brightening Renewal, I immediately wanted to try it.  I have use every kind of moisturizer, serum, Vitamin A and C cream, BB and CC creams, and I must say that Oil of Olay is always right up there with the higher end products.  I liked this new formula.  To me, the texture appeared to be a combination of moisturizer mixed with serum.  It is not thick but extremely creamy and almost the color of a serum mixed with a light lotion.  I liked the way it smoothed into my skin smoothed out the texture of my skin.  I must say, since I began using this product almost three weeks ago, I have used less foundation and less concealer.  My skin does look brighter and smoother.  I would highly recommend this product.  For the price, it is more expensive than Oil of Olay products used to be, but it is in competition with other high end online or department store products.  It is not an unreasonable price.  The packaging isn&#x27;t fancy and neither is the jar it comes in, and that helps keep the price down.  For me, it is a no brainer.  Oil of Olay has never let me down.</li>
    <li> This cream purports to help renew skin surface for a brighter, more even skin tone.  It also claims to smooth skin texture with nourishing hydration and reduce the look of dull skin for a smoother, more even skin tone.  The product info says it was professionally designed for daily use by Olay skin scientists and dermatologists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this product is tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s experience.  After 1.5 weeks of daily use (as directed), the product resulted in only a slight to moderate reduction in dull skin and skin tone did look moderately more even.  Unlike other Olay products, this one did not result in a negative skin reaction - other Olays tend to make her break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - this is a good offering by Olay which does tend to brighten and even skin tone with repeated use.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It is very light and absorbs into the skin in just a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- Proctor &amp; Gamble offers a 60-day refund policy if you call them (866-710-7769) with your receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I did not notice any brightening of the skin after using it for just 2 weeks but I will keep trying until it runs out.&lt;br /&gt;- Keep in mind that the body&#x27;s largest organ is the skin and that it is very porous.

    <li> I have sensitive, breakout-prone skin, and this Olay brightening renewal cream smoothes the surface of the skin without causing breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s, and this winter was causing a dry and ruddy surface on my face. Up until I started using this product, I was using a cheaper St. Ives lotion (it was causing breakouts) and a more expensive Kiehl&#x27;s facial lotion (it left my face extremely oily). Worse, neither cream was solving the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion not only smoothes the surface of my skin, it also leaves a soft, matte feeling behind. I can&#x27;t speak for the even skin tone effects, as I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference. What I love is that there&#x27;s no greasy T-zone after application, and the ruddiness of winter is gone. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using this Olay Pro-X, and I&#x27;ll be sticking with it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot creams even the expensive ones. And I have alwyas heard about Olay so decided to try it. Made my skin better, cleared it up. For it&#x27;s price, it&#x27;s worth to try it.</li>
    <li> Seems like an excellent product so far. The texture is light and creamy, not super thick like many similar products. You rub it into your face and neck and leave it on all night. It dries quickly. I can tell the difference when not using it actually. In the mornings when it is used, my skin seems dryer and blotchier kind of, I would have to say. It&#x27;s quite soothing. Practically scentless, what scent there is really is just kind of typical skin cream scent. There&#x27;s a corresponding daytime product that is recommended, which I didn&#x27;t have access to. The reduction in star rating is simply because I can only base this on quite short-term usage as opposed to longterm. And also it is admittedly a bit pricey for the amount contained in the jar (which is deceptively little, given the size of the glass jar).</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product.  It is very light and fragrance free.  You only need a small amount and it really sinks into your skin and moisturizes.  However it caused me to break out.  My skin is pretty sensitive so I tried to only use it every other night and I still broke out.  In the few weeks that I have used it I have not noticed any difference as far skin tone and brightening.  My skin does feel softer but the breakout will probably prevent me from using more of it.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it is advertised to do. It has helped brighten my skin and even my skin tone. I really like how the product feels on my skin. Based upon my own experience, I definitely recommend this Olay product.</li>
    <li> When it comes to high quality and reasonable price that is backed by some of the best skincare research teams, the Olay brand is hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;This cream doesn&#x27;t have the signature Olay scent, which is good news for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;One of my issues is redness on my cheeks, and not in the nice Snow White way. This product did help with the ruddy patches,  and there was none of the stinging my sensitive skin sometimes experiences.</li>
    <li> So far, I really love this!  I need to use it and then update my review as far as the brightening aspect.  I have been putting this on each night right before I go to bed and my face is so soft and smooth when I get up in the morning!  It also doesn&#x27;t have that winter-dryness feeling after I get out of the shower, so I know the moisture is below the surface.  The tone of my skin is looking better also but that is something I will have to confirm after using for a month so, I never really believe in the quick fixes!  There is no perfume to this and Olay is definitely a brand to be trusted so I could see myself buying this and the price being justified.  Review to be updated in a month!</li>
    <li> Yes, I have a few age spots and my skin can be a little dull. I have dry skin and the dry flakes can dull my complexion, and I have to be careful with exfoliates because of my sensitive and dry skin. I have used the Olay product line for years, I can remember when it was Oil of Olay.. and I am fond of the regenerist line, especially the firming cream. I haven&#x27;t used must of the pro-x, but I like the brightening renewal cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note is that it&#x27;s for night time use, it&#x27;s not a day moisturizer. So just keep that in mind. I would say my face is brighter, and some of the age spots,.. sheesh let&#x27;s just call them spots and darkening have lightened. I love the feel of the cream going on my face, very soothing and I&#x27;ve had no irritation. The scent is light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lid is weird, it&#x27;s oval instead of round, artistic I suppose, but it makes it screw on strange, not hard, not a big deal, just sort of why not make it round? But the product inside is lovely.</li>
    <li> I like Olay products and have been using them for sometime now. This one is new to me and I can see that it will take a while to really get the dark spot  fading &#x27;results&#x27; if they indeed do work like they say. No heavy odor. Great for using at night. Though not a really heavy cream. Doesn&#x27;t get flaky like Regenerist does sometimes. This is the first of the Olay Pro-X I have used and I think it holds promise, but more from a moisturizing standpoint than a Spot fading cream.</li>
    <li> The ProX Even Skin Tone \\&quot;Brightening Renewal Cream\\&quot; is sort of vague about what it does -- what is skin brightening, anyway? The box describes it as intensely hydrating and renewing the surface. However, for spot fading, they recommend using an additional product during the day, with the skin brightening cream at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is purposely misleading in size -- there is an inner core containing the cream, and a much larger outer portion that magnifies it, to make it look like more. It contains 1.7 oz, which is a pretty small amount. There is no pump; you must dip your finger (or other implement) in. This has the advantage of allowing you to use as much or little as you like, while obviously introducing germs into the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried it, it had no perfume odor, but it does have a sort of chemical smell. It also has a mild burn, such as one tends to associate with these types of products. It is not painful, but I did feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of daily use, my skin appears to look slightly brighter and I have not had any adverse reactions. I will update as my usage continues.</li>
    <li> I have sun spots near one eyebrow. I&#x27;ve used other products from the very expensive, to Murad which I use their products on daily basis but not their lightening lotion. I&#x27;ve found after 2 weeks, the spot is lightening so will continue to use as well as sun lotion to prevent any from returning. Also helps lessen the redness- rosacea on my cheeks too!</li>
    <li> This is a smooth cream that goes on easily. It has a very mild scent that is fairly pleasant. The down side is that on tender skin there is a bit of a rash. My wife has been using Olay products back when they were Oil of Olay and she was always very satisfied. She has a tender skin so this cream is a bit iffy and she plans to use very little of it and in just a few places where the rash feeling is negligent.</li>
    <li> I have pretty pale skin and I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s whiten or not so I was mostly trying this product to see how well my skin handled shaving scars because I saw another user who commented it worked for them. I have a bad habit of shaving in the dark in the bathtub and cutting up my face (laziness?) so it was a nice opportunity to potentially deal with some of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying it for the past week and I&#x27;m seeing some difference already. It&#x27;s not drastic but it definitely seems to be fading a bit. It&#x27;s easy enough to apply and it doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue so it&#x27;s something you can apply before bed without issue. My wife has sensitive skin though and when she tried she said it felt uncomfortable so she quickly removed it. I&#x27;d say like any product for your skin you should try it yourself in a small dose and decide if it&#x27;ll work for you. Luckily my skin was fine so we are able to get some use out of it but it&#x27;s definitely not something for everyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Olay Pro-X Even Skin Tone Brightening Renewal Cream for about a week at this point, and I really do love it.  No perfume-y scent (LOVE that), and it goes on nicely.  Creamy, so I really know that I&#x27;ve put it on my face, plus I feel it -- almost like a sting, but that is too strong of a word -- as I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs well, and quickly, and as long as I don&#x27;t coat it onto my face, it doesn&#x27;t leave any type of residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really speak to the whole evening out the skin tone concept, as I don&#x27;t have any major issues there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I can speak to the &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; and smoothing out of old skin.  I&#x27;m not all that old (47) but enough that my skin has been looking and feeling rather &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; as of late.  I absolutely notice fresher, smoother, younger-feeling skin since using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am applying it in the evening (as suggested) but usually during the day as well.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
