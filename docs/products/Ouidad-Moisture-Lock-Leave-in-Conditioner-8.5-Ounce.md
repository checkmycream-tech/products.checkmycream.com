      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I have been using Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave in Conditioner and it has drastically changed styling my hair for the better.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I remembered seeing ads for Ouidad in magazines and decided to give this product a try, I was not disappointed!</li>
      <li>The price is well worth me being able to wear my wavy hair  nicely</li>
      <li>It was fine, but I&#x27;ve used better.  </li>
      <li>but I have always straightened it because I didn&#x27;t know where to find a good product that would allow me to wear it naturally and have nice smooth waves.  </li>
      <li>When I use this product I get daily compliments on how beautiful my hair is.</li>
      <li>I have baby fine, wavy to curly hair, I think it would be a 2B.  </li>
      <li>I wash my fine, curly hair every day, which causes my hair stylist to cringe.</li>
      <li>Arrived well packaged and safely as well as quickly.</li>
      <li>My hair looks FABULOUS with these products.</li>
      <li>It is worth the price:)</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic leave in conditioner for taming curly hair and keeping frizz under control.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants softer, more flexible curls :)</li>
      <li>Perhaps there are better leave-in conditioners out there, but thus far I&#x27;ve been pleased with this one.</li>
      <li>great to use in the summer and air dry my hair.</li>
      <li>Really nice leave in, not heavy but moisturizes.</li>
      <li>I think this product works somewhat, but not any better than the much cheaper Dove brand product.  </li>
      <li>I have never had my hair become so damaged so quickly in all my years of styling and processing my hair</li>
      <li>Smells like laundry detergent, super soapy smell.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is perfect for those of us with curly hair, especially on mornings when time is short.  </li>
      <li>It left our hair feeling silky and our natural curls were beautiful.</li>
      <li>This leave-in conditioner is an absolute life safer!!</li>
      <li>This conditioner allows me to finally embrace my waves without all the frizz, I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Great moisture without the heavy oils.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Expensive but worth it because it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s the best Ouidad i have used my thin curly hair</li>
      <li>Some may think it is pricey, but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>it smells like cheap dollar store rose air freshener; to the point where I had to mix it with some other conditioners to mask the smell and use it in the shower to wash it out.</li>
      <li>Now she air dries her hair, which I don&#x27;t have the time or patience to do, but regardless this stuff made a difference right away</li>
      <li>As a result,  my hair is pretty dried out and fly away.</li>
      <li>Just apply apply some after I towel dry my hair and the results are amazing.</li>
      <li>I have noticed that hair can seem lank or greasy with too much, but that&#x27;s pretty much true of any product, so I don&#x27;t hold it against Ouidad.</li>
      <li>Although my hair was in beautiful condition at the time (about 7 weeks ago), it was getting long enough that I decided to take &amp;#34;preventative&amp;#34; measures with summer approaching and start adding even more moisture and protection by adding a heavier leave-in that I could add to my ends.</li>
      <li>I like how it works though and will continue to use this because of the high price!!</li>
      <li>Once it&#x27;s dry, I either leave it alone for high curl definition, or run my fingers through for a smooth, shiny, healthy curl-wave look.</li>
      <li>Ordinarily, my hair is very healthy and shiny rarely get split ends</li>
      <li>a positive note</li>
      <li>Been using this product for a long time and still love it.</li>
      <li>Nice quality product for my daughter&#x27;s dry, naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>and this is one of the only conditioners that detangles easily without too much effort.</li>
      <li>Either this is a fraudulent product in a Ouidad bottle and isn&#x27;t the real Ouidad product, or Ouidad has really dropped the ball.</li>
      <li>The product arrived within 2 to 3 days and is the real thing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love how this smells!</li>
    <li> I have color-treated straight to wavy hair. I get do get frizzy, especially in humidity. Ordinarily, my hair is very healthy and shiny rarely get split ends and that&#x27;s with flat-ironing several times a week for years. I recently decided to start letting it grow longer so I stopped blow-drying or flat-ironing. Although my hair was in beautiful condition at the time (about 7 weeks ago), it was getting long enough that I decided to take &amp;#34;preventative&amp;#34; measures with summer approaching and start adding even more moisture and protection by adding a heavier leave-in that I could add to my ends. I tried this product upon recommend (bought it from a salon). Within a week and a half of use (I don&#x27;t even wash every day) the ends of my hair (where I was concentrating it) were DESTROYED. I could no longer even run my hands through my hair. It left a strange sticky residue that would not wash off. My hair never felt so dry. It&#x27;s like putting Elmer&#x27;s school glue in your hair. The reason everyone keeps saying it doesn&#x27;t weight their hair down...It felt like a very roudy texturizer. I stopped using it. I thought the sticky feeling would go away if I just didn&#x27;t use it. It did not...I started doing hair conditioning masks twice a week in order to try to repair damage and save as much of the length that I&#x27;ve worked so hard for...Needless to say, I&#x27;m pretty pissed. Afterall, I bought a conditioner. This was the last thing I expected to have happen as a result. I have never had my hair become so damaged so quickly in all my years of styling and processing my hair (and I was one of the girls loading my hair up with Aquanet in the 80&#x27;s!). After 5 weeks of literal &amp;#34;damage control&amp;#34;, I had to have a decent chunk of my hair cut off last night...I have to say it...BUYER BEWARE--this is the WORST hair product I have ever used. If I could give it negative stars, I would.</li>
    <li> I wash my fine, curly hair every day, which causes my hair stylist to cringe. But if I don&#x27;t, I look as though I combed my hair with a wash cloth. As a result,  my hair is pretty dried out and fly away. I am constantly looking for some product that will tame the frizz without looking oily.  This lotion makes my hair flat, no matter how little I use.  I may try rinsing it out or just putting it on the ends. The texture of the cream is nice, just a tad heavy for me.</li>
    <li> Hello everyone and hope everyone is okay.  I tried Ouidad leave-in conditioner, and the Botanical Boost, and the Climate Control.  The only one that did a little bit for my hair was the leave-in conditioner.  It took out most of the tangles, but it weighed it down alot.  I have oily, down past my shoulder length hair and I was not happy with the products at all.  First, the Climate Control was supposed to do just that, but instead of making it bouncy it came out extremely dry, crackly and frizzy!  The Botanical Boost just made it limp and flat and not at all shiny.  Now, maybe someone with hair that is not oily and more curly than mine would be happy with this product, but I was not.  I&#x27;m going to give them away to whomever may want them and like them, but I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> My hair has been curly all my life, but hard to do anything with - so I have had it cut short for most of my adult life. On a whim, I&#x27;ve let the back grow longer and it was curling beautifully. I&#x27;ve actually permed my hair in the past just to force the curls to do what I wanted. Well, if I had known about Ouidad products in the past, I would not have been so foolish. My hair looks FABULOUS with these products. I am using the following: moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, leave in conditioner, climate control and moisture lock. (Yes, I have dry hair! And live in Colorado - dry, dry, dry). I wash and condition (rinse) daily, add a pea size dollop of leave in conditioner, mix a dime size climate control and moisture lock in my hands and use my fingers to comb through my hair. Mush the top into shape and go. Once it&#x27;s dry, I either leave it alone for high curl definition, or run my fingers through for a smooth, shiny, healthy curl-wave look. It&#x27;s amazing!   Please note, I have been searching for this kind of look for a very long time (in my 50s) and FINALLY have the look I&#x27;ve wanted.</li>
    <li> I think this product works somewhat, but not any better than the much cheaper Dove brand product.  I do not think it prevents frizz in my hair when the humidity is high.  I am somewhat disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ordered the started package from Quidad to see if my newly curling hair would respond well to it.  I had curly hair as a child but it&#x27;s only since I have hit my 40&#x27;s and grown my hair back out is it curly again.  I have fine hair and lots of it so usually leave in products weigh my hair down....NOT this one, it&#x27;s awsome - since the front of my hair is not curly I usually pull the front back with a clip and enjoy my long curly/wavy hair thanks to Quidad.  As for the rest of the kit...well I cancelled my membership and will just get the leave in from Sephora.....and well lets leave it at that!</li>
    <li> Been using it in both the shower and as a leave-in-moisturizer for the past two weeks and my hair feels soft &amp; silky. I have naturally thick, curly hair so I&#x27;m always trying new products to keep it hydrated. I often flat iron my hair &amp; the Ouidad leave-in works well with it; my hair isn&#x27;t greasy or frizzy or dry, &amp; smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend bought it for me so I&#x27;m not sure if it can be found cheaper somewhere else, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the try. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again when this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It define my curls leaving my hair manageable without weighing down my strands. Perfect balance of moisture. Hair is not wet but at the same time not dry</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic leave in conditioner for taming curly hair and keeping frizz under control.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a long time and still love it. I have long curly hair and this is one of the only conditioners that detangles easily without too much effort.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is perfect for those of us with curly hair, especially on mornings when time is short.  Wash with Ouidad shampoo, rinse, then use a dollop of this leave-in conditioner.  Rake it through and shake your curls into place.  Use a diffuser, if you want, to partially dry your hair.  Fast and efficient, and it leaves hair very soft, not stiff and crispy.</li>
    <li> Best product ever!  I have curly frizzy hair, No frizz at all, all day long!</li>
    <li> MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER BOTH USE THIS PRODUCT AND THEY ARE VERY PLEASED WITH PRODUCT...THE COST WAS GOOD, SO I&#x27;M HAPPY...</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this because Ouidad is made for people with curly hair. I don&#x27;t even know where to start.... the smell... it smells like cheap dollar store rose air freshener; to the point where I had to mix it with some other conditioners to mask the smell and use it in the shower to wash it out. It is heavy and WILL weigh your hair down!!! I tried using it because it was so expensive for a small bottle. I even tried using it as a shower &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; I ended up squeezing it down the drain in anger because it was so horrible. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!! Not for fine, thin curly hair!!!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected to receive.  No issues.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair that needs daily leave-in conditioner to keep it manageable. This is the best product I have ever come across. It keeps my curls soft and shiny without making them greasy and no more dry flyaway hair. Seriously without leave-in conditioner it looks like I put my finger in an electrical socket. When I use this product I get daily compliments on how beautiful my hair is. I have been using this for over a year now and will continue as long as it is available. A little pricey, but well worth it!</li>
    <li> This stuff leaves my hair feeling like straw. I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s even possible for something called a leave-in &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34;, but it does. At first I thought I must be doing something wrong or something because it didn&#x27;t make any sense, but then I realized that when I would wash it off of my hands after applying it to my hair, they&#x27;d feel dry and rubbery like I&#x27;d just used a bar of non-moisturizing soap. That&#x27;s definitely not normal. Either this is a fraudulent product in a Ouidad bottle and isn&#x27;t the real Ouidad product, or Ouidad has really dropped the ball. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> this is good i like it, it&#x27;s the best Ouidad i have used my thin curly hair feels great doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it feel heavy or greasy</li>
    <li> Nice quality product for my daughter&#x27;s dry, naturally curly hair. Arrived well packaged and safely as well as quickly.</li>
    <li> Perfect!! I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this for a very long time. I have naturally curly hair which has lost a lot of it&#x27;s curl over the years resulting in a wavy/frizy mess on top of my head. I needed something to give my curls definition as they once had naturally. A friend at worked mentioned this product along with the Ouidad gel. I didn&#x27;t care for the gel, it&#x27;s very light and didn&#x27;t make a difference on my hair. But this leave in conditioner is all I need! I use this in place of gel or mousse and scrunch my hair and let it dry naturally. Since I&#x27;ve been doing this I&#x27;ve had numerous compliments on my hair! The spiral curls are back!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite hair products. I use it in conjunction with a hair diffuser, mousse, and Morocco Curling Cream. I like that it moisturizers my hair, which curly hair needs, and isn&#x27;t too heavy or sticky.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this conditioner. It is not a lightweight formula as advertised. I found it to be thick and sticky. Also, it smells like sour milk. Not good.</li>
    <li> having kinky curly hair, it tends to dry out quickly. I had high hopes, pictured that my hair would stay EXTREMELY soft.... my hopes were shattered. not worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> Just okay. Someone recommended this to me to help with my curls. I don&#x27;t think it does anything more than other products out there. My hair still is frizzy when it dries.  I don&#x27;t have defined curls like I thought I would with the recommendation.</li>
    <li> It was fine, but I&#x27;ve used better.  While it didn&#x27;t have any detrimental affects, there also weren&#x27;t any noticeable benefits with use.  I don&#x27;t recommend, even though I gave it three stars.  There&#x27;s better out there.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair; probably a 2c and 3a, and I grew up hating my curls since they were so difficult to deal with and so frizzy. These past two years I have been on a mission to let my curls be as natural and healthy as possible, so I stopped cutting it short and frying it with a flat iron and let it be. I bought this product because of the amazing reviews and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results! My hair is about halfway down my back in length and I use about a dime sized amount of leave in conditioner on wet hair and work the product from the tips of my hair through to my roots and it makes my hair silky soft. I use this product in combination with curl keeper and when my hair is dry I have wonderfully soft ringlets. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants softer, more flexible curls :)</li>
    <li> This is one if the best conditioners for my curly hair. Some may think it is pricey, but it is worth it. I&#x27;ve tried many others but none can compare to this one for cutting the frizz and keeping my hair manageable!</li>
    <li> My fine, wavyish, color treated hair is a disaster of static electricity in the winter, and putting a small amount of this product in my hair after showering and allowing it to dry naturally really helps. I have noticed that hair can seem lank or greasy with too much, but that&#x27;s pretty much true of any product, so I don&#x27;t hold it against Ouidad.</li>
    <li> I use this leave-in conditioner as a substitute for in-shower conditioner since regular conditioners usually dryout my hair but this does not. I have been using it for 2 years now and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> This conditioner does what it says and that is keeps the hair soft and moist without frizz. Recommend highly!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curley dry hair.  I have been using Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave in Conditioner and it has drastically changed styling my hair for the better.  No friz and manageable hair!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest conditioner AND styling tool for curly hair. I can wash my hair AT NIGHT, leave it in and go to bed. I wake up with shiny, bouncy, NON frizzy gorgeous curls! I dont need anymore expensive styling tools. THIS IS IT! AND it&#x27;s good for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I also like &amp;#34;Whipped Curls&amp;#34; by the brand. Excellent results!</li>
    <li> Its hard to find a product that works well but this one works great. I love it. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine, wavy to curly hair, I think it would be a 2B.  I am able to get a lot of spiral curls when I use this product.  It enhances defines my curls to a 2C. It adds shine.  I can&#x27;t tell I have product in my hair.  Sometimes I will add a gel on top like Deva.  I started out with a small bottle just to try it out.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used mousse or gel on my hair, but after talking to a friend about how she got her hair to maintain it&#x27;s curls without looking frizzy, I tried the Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave-in Conditioner.  Now she air dries her hair, which I don&#x27;t have the time or patience to do, but regardless this stuff made a difference right away - it&#x27;s now part of my daily routine.  Highly recommend you give it a try!</li>
    <li> The product arrived within 2 to 3 days and is the real thing. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Smells like laundry detergent, super soapy smell. Hate the smell, and very little moisture provided, I&#x27;ll stick with It&#x27;s A Ten.</li>
    <li> Great!  Just a heads up it makes my hair stay wet longer than usual if you air dry</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner is okay, not better or worse then anything you can buy in the store.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly/frizzy hair, and this leave-in conditioner works really well especially in humid weather.  It goes on really thick and is easy to apply.  Rather than out of control, frizzy waves, I am left with soft curls when I apply this to my hair after washing and towel-drying.  I often use this in conjunction with some mousse to get little ringlets and keep my hair looking somewhat sane.  Perhaps there are better leave-in conditioners out there, but thus far I&#x27;ve been pleased with this one.</li>
    <li> I love this product and when used as directed and consistently it makes my hair beautiful. The friz in my curls is nonexsistent.</li>
    <li> Great hair moisturizer. Keeps hair in great condition.  Good for all hair types.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of VERY fine hair.  If I don&#x27;t use a hair product, my hair dries fuzzy (not necessarily frizzy).  I use a little bit of this product, rake it through my hair and let it air dry.  Raking it through it key.  My hair strands bond together giving me great curls.  This is a great product for people with fine hair looking for curl definition.</li>
    <li> I have type 3b/c curls and I&#x27;m always looking to get shiny, soft, defined, frizz-free curls.  I got a small bottle of this product as part of a Curl Quencher set and I absolutely love it.  It is perfect for my hair type.  It leaves my hair soft and hydrated and gives my hair enough weight so that it doesn&#x27;t look too poofy/wide.  I don&#x27;t think this product is a good pick for women with wavy curls or loose curls because it&#x27;ll weigh it down too much.  But if you have tighter curls like me then this is a good product.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling greasy</li>
    <li> Best curl product I have ever used. Leaves hair soft and curls last longer.  Used with ouidad climate control gel or curl quencher gel.</li>
    <li> I love this product! This leave-in conditioner is an absolute life safer!! Gets rid of my over-the-top crazy tangles! Allows me to get a comb through my hair! And helps my hair look awesome!</li>
    <li> Great product! My hair looks healthier and has more body. Lots of compliments on how healthy my hair looks. A little goes a long way. Use more for greater body.</li>
    <li> I use this product with Ouidad Mongongo oil treatment, and I would highly recommend both products. This product does an amazing job moisturizing my hair, and works well detangling as well. It is worth the price:)</li>
    <li> I have coarse, thick, frizzy, wavy hair but I have always straightened it because I didn&#x27;t know where to find a good product that would allow me to wear it naturally and have nice smooth waves.  I remembered seeing ads for Ouidad in magazines and decided to give this product a try, I was not disappointed! This conditioner allows me to finally embrace my waves without all the frizz, I love this stuff! So much so, that I bought an extra bottle so I don&#x27;t run out! The price is well worth me being able to wear my wavy hair  nicely and I get a lot of compliments now.</li>
    <li> Really nice leave in, not heavy but moisturizes. I also use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair, both of them have long curly hair that likes to knot, this seems to help quite a bit with the brushing out process after it&#x27;s washed. Will keep buying it for us all!</li>
    <li> Great moisture without the heavy oils. Have added this line of products to must have hair items works well with my other maintenance products.</li>
    <li> I discovered that the 3rd , 4th, and 5th ingredients was actually alcohol.... And since my hair is curly , it is dry already , so I don&#x27;t want any extra chemicals that will dry out my hair.... it will probably work for straight hair</li>
    <li> I have curly 3a, long hair (down below my bust) and I just tried this product as a sample this morning. I noticed that I have to put a lot in but it leaves my hair very soft and shiny. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because I have to add a curl defining creme as well. I just used the leave in conditioner at first and let my hair air dry to see how it works, but then I noticed that after a few hours I had to add a curl defining creme because it doesn&#x27;t define the curl.</li>
    <li> My hair is dry so leave in conditioner is a big part of my life.  This is an all around good product.</li>
    <li> use this everyday and love how my hair feels</li>
    <li> expensive stuff, but it really just takes a VERY small amount to do the job so it&#x27;ll last!!&lt;br /&gt;Along with the nice smell and how it really softens and gives some style and moisture to my hair, it&#x27;s actually well worth the cost for such few ounces. Love it.</li>
    <li> My mom purchased this product and we absolutely love it. It left our hair feeling silky and our natural curls were beautiful.</li>
    <li> Although I am not particularly a fan of the scent, this does miracles to my hair! I am usually a frizz monster and I was trying to look for a leave-in conditioner that actually worked. This product exceeded my expectations! Not only is the frizz gone, it&#x27;s left my hair shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The smell is pretty bad!!! I like how it works though and will continue to use this because of the high price!!</li>
    <li> Disappointed with the results.  I have used store products that deliver better results for much less.</li>
    <li> I like to air dry my hair as often as possible.  I find it next to impossible to keep the shape and avoid my hair from drying out and getting split ends.  I bought this product based on several product recommendations.  For the intended purpose, it does NOT work.  The tips of my hair still dry out and get split ends.  The ingredients include alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, this has a subtle scent that I like.  It does provide some hold if used in moderation.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  The only conditioner that keeps away the frizzes.</li>
    <li> Great product! Hair is curly and soft!</li>
    <li> Good stuff- keeps hair moisturizer and minimizes frizz!</li>
    <li> I am African American/ European and my hair can get a little wild. It&#x27;s frizzy, dry, and combination of wavy and tight curls. I got this as a sample on Sephora and immediately fell in love. I bought it on Amazon because it is cheaper. Just apply apply some after I towel dry my hair and the results are amazing. My curls don&#x27;t frizz, my hair feels soft all day, and I won&#x27;t use anything else. Apply it with Moroccan Argon Oil and you have yourself a guaranteed fabulous hair day! I would recommend it to anybody with similar hair the results are amazing for me!</li>
    <li> great to use in the summer and air dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a year. Although I moisturize my hair a lot, everyone once in a while it looks a little frizzy. I just use this after my shower, then mousse it and the moisture is back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive but worth it because it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
