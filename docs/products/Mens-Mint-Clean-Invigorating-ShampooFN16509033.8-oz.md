      <li>This shampoo really leaves my hair feeling clean and hydrated.  </li>

      <li>It does smell like soap at first and then the peppermint kicks in.  </li>
      <li>know this shampoo is for men, but I don&#x27;t care because that&#x27;s how much I like it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a little upset that I bought a 33oz huge bottle of this thinking I was going to love it.  </li>
      <li>Would absolutely buy again.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo makes my head tingle while applying it, and leaves my hair clean, but not dry.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I like this much.  </li>
      <li>I had purchased the Redkin \\&quot;clean\\&quot; shampoo from a salon and that was much thicker in consistancy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very relaxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>It had some mint smell but not as intense as before.  </li>
      <li>I paid $16.98 (free shipping with Prime) for 33.8 ounces which is the same or less than most sellers or offering the 10 ounce bottle for.</li>
      <li>For a little more I purchased 4 times as much.</li>
      <li>I love the mint smell and slight tingle</li>
      <li>He has used it for a year, and says he likes it, particularly the minty scent.</li>
      <li>This was a lot better when I bought it a few years ago.</li>
      <li>Great shampoo, cleansing, and packaged in a manly military-surplus green &amp; black bottle.</li>
      <li>Seriously invest in the bigger bottle, you&#x27;ll be loving the feeling on your scalp!</li>
      <li>I bought the Mint Clean shampoo from this merchant (Angelic Beauty Center)  </li>
      <li>I first found out about this shampoo because I got the samples as a present.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly and arrived as expected.</li>
      <li>We but the large 33.8 ounce bottles and fill smaller bottles for our showers and for our toiletry kits when we travel.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is hard to find in my area and it is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I sent it back and asked for a replacement if they had one with the REAL shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It smelled totally different, and did not have the Mint effect that the real Redken shampoo has.  </li>
      <li>I am not a fan of the Mint Clean Conditioner (it is to thick)</li>
      <li>so generally it&#x27;s not a big deal, but for a little extra I think this shampoo is definitely worth it</li>
      <li>and so far doesn&#x27;t require conditioner as I tend to let my hair get long.</li>
      <li>Leaves a clean slightly minty smell and tingles a bit if you leave it on a few minutes.</li>

<li> I like this shampoo but wish it could be a little minty-er.  </li>
<li> They must have stopped manufacturing it and this had been sitting on a shelf somewhere for a few years.</li>
<li> no more dandruff !!!!</li>

    <li> Shipped quickly and arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> Good product and the price is right</li>
    <li> The mint clean shampoo came as exactly as described. I&#x27;ve typically used cheaper brands of shampoo before (tres emme) and have been trying some new shampoos. This shampoo actually has a nice minty smell when washing your hair and a nice little tingle as you rinse it out. My hair is clean and feels great afterwards. It&#x27;s shampoo, and we are guys so generally it&#x27;s not a big deal, but for a little extra I think this shampoo is definitely worth it and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite shampoo and conditioner. It has an invigorating smell and fills the bathroom with minty cleanliness...most of the time it overpowers my girly perfumes and such but its refreshing! Makes your scalp tingle too! Long hair or short, it works.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hoping the product would be tingly on my scalp. I was disapointed that the shampoo seamed to be \\&quot;watered down\\&quot; and didn&#x27;t give me the tingle like feeling I have had with other products similar to this one. I had purchased the Redkin \\&quot;clean\\&quot; shampoo from a salon and that was much thicker in consistancy.I would not reccomend this shampoo from my experience.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo but wish it could be a little minty-er.  I&#x27;ve used the J Crew mint shampoo before and it had a nice bite to it that felt better on the scalp.  This is a much more mild mint.</li>
    <li> Great deal, and my favorite shampoo. Will continue to order.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice smelling, mild shampoo that both my wife and I enjoy using.  We but the large 33.8 ounce bottles and fill smaller bottles for our showers and for our toiletry kits when we travel.  This is a really good product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband to use because he has naturally dry skin/scalp, and I hoped a nicer shampoo would be gentler on his hair. He has used it for a year, and says he likes it, particularly the minty scent. It seems to have helped the dry scalp to some degree, as I notice less flakes, but there are still some occasionally, however that may just be due to genetics. I will definitely buy this again for him; the 33.8 oz bottle lasts over a year at our house.</li>
    <li> The bottle I received didn&#x27;t have the same smell and tingly effect (this one was sold by Beautogen but seller keeps changing for the link to this particular shampoo) as the previous one I bought from a retail store.  It had some mint smell but not as intense as before.  And, it had some other smell that I couldn&#x27;t put a finger on.  I sent it back and asked for a replacement if they had one with the REAL shampoo.  They just refunded my money and I didn&#x27;t hear back from them. It wasn&#x27;t until a week or two later that I realized what the other smell was......Johnson&#x27;s Baby shampoo.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. Bumped across it by accident and bought the big jug. Doesn&#x27;t over smell or smell girly. Leaves a clean slightly minty smell and tingles a bit if you leave it on a few minutes.Cleans hair well and so far doesn&#x27;t require conditioner as I tend to let my hair get long.</li>
    <li> I love the mint smell and slight tingle you feel when using this product. The price was fantastic.  I paid $16.98 (free shipping with Prime) for 33.8 ounces which is the same or less than most sellers or offering the 10 ounce bottle for.</li>
    <li> Refreshing minty smell with a hint of a tingle when shampooing, but no stupidly-overly-minty after-smell. Great shampoo, cleansing, and packaged in a manly military-surplus green &amp; black bottle.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this product on my hair. I love the way that it makes my scalp tingle, and it smells fresh all day. When I went to purchase in the salon, an 8 oz. bottle was $16. For a little more I purchased 4 times as much. Great price. Great Product.</li>
    <li> I bought the Mint Clean shampoo from this merchant (Angelic Beauty Center)  They sent me a counterfeit Redken Mint Clean shampoo.  It did not smell the same, and the bottle was a slightly different color.  It smelled totally different, and did not have the Mint effect that the real Redken shampoo has.  Be warned.</li>
    <li> no more dandruff !!!! I love a product that works</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  Feels great on your head and scalp.  Smells good too.</li>
    <li> There is definitely a difference between the 3 dollar shampoos, and the 20 dollar shampoos.  This shampoo makes my head tingle while applying it, and leaves my hair clean, but not dry.  Though it has not advertised this ability, when using the shampoo and conditioner in combination, it has fought off a case of dandruff that extra strength Selsun Blue could only keep at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve found the shampoo for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> My mother is a beautician, i&#x27;ve used tons and tons of different brands of shampoos and conditioners over the years (i&#x27;m 29 now) and this is the one. This and the cool finish conditioner are perfect for my hair type.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this to me.  It makes me hair tingle!  I also feel fresh and clean after using it. As my first redkin product I am impressed and will purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> Wish it was more tingly like most mint clean shampoos. Smells good and does clean your hair. Most men would enjoy this</li>
    <li> The shampoo has a slight minty tingly feel to it. I use it to help wake up. But the cleaning ability seems slightly less than other shampoos. &#x27;Wish it had more minty effect.</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite shampoo.  Will buy the conditioner too!</li>
    <li> It works as you would want it to. I like the smell. My hair is clean. What more is there? Recomended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I like this much.  Smells like medicine to me actually, and I just don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels like after washing. I&#x27;m a little upset that I bought a 33oz huge bottle of this thinking I was going to love it.  I&#x27;m buying some Aveda instead.</li>
    <li> This was a lot better when I bought it a few years ago. They must have stopped manufacturing it and this had been sitting on a shelf somewhere for a few years.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this shampoo is for men, but I don&#x27;t care because that&#x27;s how much I like it! I first found out about this shampoo because I got the samples as a present. If you are not a fan of that minty feeling on your scalp, then skip this one. But, if you love it, buy this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to wash my hair a dandruff shampoo before I apply the Mint Redken, just because for me, I feel the mintyness more once I&#x27;ve washed my hair once. Seriously invest in the bigger bottle, you&#x27;ll be loving the feeling on your scalp! It&#x27;s very relaxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;--minty and fresh&lt;br /&gt;--leaves hair feeling clean&lt;br /&gt;--relaxing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;--wish it came with a pump&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Would absolutely buy again.  One of my favorite shampoos.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really leaves my hair feeling clean and hydrated.  Using other cheap products, my hair usually feels dry out of the shower but that was not the case with Redken.  Furthermore, I sometimes even get that minty tingling feeling they talk about, though sometimes it&#x27;s in the eyes because I don&#x27;t know how to rinse my hair properly...</li>
    <li> It is the best shampoo I ever buy.  You can use it every day and your hair will have a better look</li>
    <li> Less cost than at hair salon same quality product.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  I like the Mint Clean Shampoo substantially more than the Redken Go Clean version for men.  It is more hydrating and my hair feels cleaner after using this shampoo.  I am not a fan of the Mint Clean Conditioner (it is to thick) however a good conditioner seems easier to find than a shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and tingle...great shampoo. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, my husband likes it</li>
    <li> My hair is Zoolander clean.  Blue Steele requires glistening locks of hair before anyone can see how ridiculously good looking you really are...</li>
    <li> Excellent way to wake up in the morning.  This shampoo is hard to find in my area and it is my favorite.  Thank goodness there&#x27;s Amazon!</li>
    <li> Does a good job. Like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I have changed my review, I don&#x27;t know if I was cranky or not but this shampoo has started to grow on me.  It does smell like soap at first and then the peppermint kicks in.  I think I just like more peppermint smell on my shampoo.</li>
