      <li>They&#x27;re very good, not as good as the Feather blades, but still good.</li>
      <li>Astra blades (made in Russia) are really good blades.  </li>
      <li>I was delighted to find them again, and to see that the Russian-made blades are as good as I remember the Czech-made ones to have been.</li>

      <li>These blades have worked the best so far for me.</li>
      <li>I will be giving  as many of these blades to my enemies as will take them.</li>
      <li>I probably could get a couple more shaves out of each blade, but</li>
      <li>I used the blade one more time and threw it out.</li>
      <li>Excellent quality on the same par with  the &#x27;Derby&#x27; blade brand.</li>
      <li>the Astra Superior Platinums are my favorite, followed closely by the Wilkinson Sword Classic.</li>

      <li>not the most aggressive blade but efficient and provides a smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>Best blades I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down.</li>
      <li>Smooth, Sharp, a great value.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.  </li>
      <li>think these would be a great blade for beginners due to the mild, forgiving shave that they offer.</li>
      <li>The Personna Israeli Crystal Super Plus Platinums tug on my whiskers and give me razor burn</li>
      <li>I think any experienced shaver would appreciate that for the days when they&#x27;re feeling lazy and just want to have an easy shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you want an easy shave without having to worry too much about nicks or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;These blades are pretty mild.</li>
      <li>For my neck (which is prone to ingrown hairs and shaving bumps), these blades are just right.</li>
      <li>I was using Feather blades and was very happy with them but the quality seemed to go down in the last year</li>
      <li>I (as a wet shaver with a bit more experience than a &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34;), also like these blades for the days that I want an easy shave without having to worry too much about cuts, nicks, or irritation.</li>
      <li>I used a couple more blades and had the same experience.</li>
      <li>I first used Astra double-edge blades about 25 years age when I was living in what was still Czechoslovakia (where the blades were then made).</li>
      <li>Not the sharpest tack in the box,the box of many manufactures of double edge blades.</li>
      <li>I recently upgraded to a Merkur 34 C DE Safety Razor and am pleased.</li>
      <li>The only ones I&#x27;ve found to be better are the Personna blades.  </li>
      <li>I am new to this type of shaving,but so far these are my favorite blades.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Again, just to recap:&lt;br /&gt;I believe that both beginners and more experienced wet shavers could enjoy these blades due to the forgiving shave they offer, however they do seem to dull quicker.</li>
      <li>, I just mean that they give a milder shave, with the tradeoff that you will have to do more passes to get really smooth.</li>
      <li>I prefer pairing up Russia&#x27;s stainless steel Astra blades with Solingen, Germany&#x27;s classic Merkur 34 C DE Razor.</li>
      <li>They are mild, but also sharp enough to get in close (with more passes) if you so chose to.</li>
      <li>I can still get in close (and even smooth), and I only have to do a couple more passes than usual.</li>
      <li>That does not mean that I think they are lower quality</li>
      <li>I always use a new blade on Sunday before Church.</li>
      <li>Smooth shave works well with several different razors</li>
      <li>My face is still reeling over the effects of the old cartridge razors.  </li>
      <li>They are the smoothest out of the ones I&#x27;ve used so far (Derby, Personna)</li>
      <li>The first blade I used tugged my facial hair, and left me irritated after my shave.</li>
      <li>I would recommend them as a starter blade for begginners, or a blade for seasoned wet shavers who want a milder blade for those days</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a double edge newbie and so far I&#x27;ve tried 3 different brands of blades...</li>
      <li>Once upon a time, about 7 months ago or so... I was walking down the aisle at Wally Mart to purchase a 20$ pack of Gillette blades, the beam of heaven( or to be realistic, we will call it a sun beam.)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Astra blades (made in Russia) are really good blades.  The only ones I&#x27;ve found to be better are the Personna blades.  I like them both.</li>
    <li> I first used Astra double-edge blades about 25 years age when I was living in what was still Czechoslovakia (where the blades were then made). I was delighted to find them again, and to see that the Russian-made blades are as good as I remember the Czech-made ones to have been. For my neck (which is prone to ingrown hairs and shaving bumps), these blades are just right. I get a close, even, irritation-free shave.</li>
    <li> Very nice blades not too aggressive great for beginners like me. Used with  Merkur 38c razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a double edge newbie and so far I&#x27;ve tried 3 different brands of blades... the Astra Superior Platinums are my favorite, followed closely by the Wilkinson Sword Classic. The Personna Israeli Crystal Super Plus Platinums tug on my whiskers and give me razor burn and I don&#x27;t like them at all.</li>
    <li> Good blades. I would recommend them as a starter blade for begginners, or a blade for seasoned wet shavers who want a milder blade for those days you want an easy shave without having to worry too much about nicks or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are pretty mild. That does not mean that I think they are lower quality, I just mean that they give a milder shave, with the tradeoff that you will have to do more passes to get really smooth. They are good quality, platinum coated stainless steel blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these would be a great blade for beginners due to the mild, forgiving shave that they offer. They are mild, but also sharp enough to get in close (with more passes) if you so chose to.

    <li> Overpriced, USA Personnas blues are just as good or better.</li>
    <li> Nothing special.  Not much different than gillette silver blues.</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to wet shaving for the past 7 months or so. My face is still reeling over the effects of the old cartridge razors.  My face is recovering and healing from the battered friction they inflict on the skin. Once upon a time, about 7 months ago or so... I was walking down the aisle at Wally Mart to purchase a 20$ pack of Gillette blades, the beam of heaven( or to be realistic, we will call it a sun beam.) Struck the mainstream marketed Micro Touch Safety Razor. To make a long story short. the Dorco blades the shave set summoned were terrible. I upgraded to Merkur blades, they are a winner. The downside, they lack a monetary value. I recently upgraded to a Merkur 34 C DE Safety Razor and am pleased. The Solingen, Germany traditional wet shaving productrides on. As it should. My Micro touch Razor is now my &amp;#34;Man Scaping&amp;#34;razor... armpit hair... which is not important...Astra! You son of a gun...you... are my go to blades for the daily Shave. A candle in the wind. Smooth, Sharp, a great value. I get it, believe me, I do. a single Astra blade may not last several shaves liken to a Merkur blade. In contrast, Astra blades 100 pack- 10$ as opposed to a 10 pack Merkur blades for 10 dollars or so. I prefer pairing up Russia&#x27;s stainless steel Astra blades with Solingen, Germany&#x27;s classic Merkur 34 C DE Razor.</li>
    <li> the best of what i have tryed servel have recommended other brands but i bet if they try this brand they will switch to it</li>
    <li> I am new to this type of shaving,but so far these are my favorite blades. They are also a great value.</li>
    <li> These blades have worked the best so far for me. They are the smoothest out of the ones I&#x27;ve used so far (Derby, Personna) and I haven&#x27;t encountered any irritation. I only use the blade around 2-3 times max so I can&#x27;t speak for durability.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality on the same par with  the &#x27;Derby&#x27; blade brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen great reviews for this blade and was excited to buy them. The first blade I used tugged my facial hair, and left me irritated after my shave. I used the blade one more time and threw it out. I used a couple more blades and had the same experience. I won&#x27;t be buying them again.</li>
    <li> Best blades I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down. I get about a week out of each blade (YMMV), shaving every-other day. I always use a new blade on Sunday before Church. I probably could get a couple more shaves out of each blade, but at this price - Why???&lt;br /&gt;I now have enough blades to last me for almost 2 years...</li>
    <li> Not the sharpest tack in the box,the box of many manufactures of double edge blades. I will be giving  as many of these blades to my enemies as will take them.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very good, not as good as the Feather blades, but still good.</li>
    <li> not the most aggressive blade but efficient and provides a smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave works well with several different razors</li>
    <li> I was using Feather blades and was very happy with them but the quality seemed to go down in the last year so I tried these out. Way better shave! They last longer and seem sharper from the get go.</li>
