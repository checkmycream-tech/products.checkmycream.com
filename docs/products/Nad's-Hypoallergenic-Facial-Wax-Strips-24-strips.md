      <li>/&gt;******These wax strips are perfect for me :)</li>
      <li>Best and most convenient wax strips.  </li>
      <li>Its nice that you&#x27;re able to cut them, to adjust them perfectly.</li>
      <li>they were just cotton strips that would be good for eyebrow waxing.</li>
      <li>But all in all I found them to be a good product.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I moved away from my threading studio and thought that these sounded good- hypoallergenic and all.  </li>
      <li>This was a good price, but now I&#x27;m stuck with 2 packs of these pimple packs.</li>
      <li>they changed the formula and were no longer any good.  </li>
      <li>(maybe i just don&#x27;t have good technique</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
      <li>Work good.  </li>
      <li>follow directions after put on wipes to get rid of all of the wax and your good.</li>
      <li>But, all-in-all, a good purchase.</li>
      <li>I get great results with them and have also tried their wax pen and like these a lot better.</li>
      <li>and it also took off the skin on the very top of my lip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was very pleased.  </li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t perfect, but honestly they are the BEST facial wax strips out there!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this item, &amp; it works great.</li>
      <li>I loved because works and I don&#x27;t have any kind of reaction after using it.</li>
      <li>I loved the strips, very easy</li>
      <li>Much better than creams!</li>
      <li>I LOVE these strips!</li>
      <li>The more you use this product, the better you get understanding how to use it best, the better your results become every time.  </li>
      <li>Nothing could be faster, easier or more efficient!</li>
      <li>Love these!</li>
      <li>This was so easy and worked great for me,</li>
      <li>The soothing towelettes are great, they remove the excess easily and they do sooth the skin.</li>
      <li>these certainly do the trick and are the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
      <li>They are fragrance free which is great</li>
      <li>and you just warm them by body heat.</li>
      <li>I did this by rubbing between my palms til they felt warm.</li>
      <li>prefer to do my own waxing if you don&#x27;t mind</li>
      <li>I put them in my waistband for 10-20min before use to warm them up to body temperature.</li>
      <li>the wipe that is provided to soothe afterwards is nice.</li>
      <li>and I am loving it.</li>
      <li>NOW, I thought this was probably my own fault, so</li>
      <li>You have to rub them vigorously between your hands to warm them up.</li>
      <li>A good way to get off that wax is cocoa butter, way better than the oily wipes they provide.  </li>
      <li>I liked them.</li>
      <li>, this will get the wax warm.  </li>
      <li>The wipe/soothing cloth is nice</li>
      <li>I really wasn&#x27;t too impressed with these wax strips.  </li>
      <li>The lotion was wonderful and very soothing.</li>
      <li>I like that its cloth style so its easier to warm up in-betweens your hands</li>
      <li>thanks alot nad&#x27;s for turning a perfect product into junk...</li>
      <li>You can warm them on your hands</li>
      <li>They come in handy because they are very easy to use, and they do remove some hair, but you will still need to pluck a couple hairs here and there.</li>
      <li>I like using these, they are effective and affordable and best of all, not messy.</li>
      <li>These strips are very easy to use.</li>
      <li>it works fine, I used the hair blower to worm it and it did a good job without causing irritation.</li>
      <li>I have tried ALL brands of wax strips and these are the best by far.  </li>
      <li>Great product and definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>Nice to be able to wax at home.</li>
      <li>I would have liked it better if I could buy just one pack at a time.</li>
      <li>Good price, they&#x27;re cheap</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>It works fairly well and is clean and neat.</li>
      <li>But like I said, I can&#x27;t put super hot wax on my face, so this is still the best alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That is why I thought these would be a good alternative, since you heat them with your own body heat getting them not so hot.  </li>
      <li>So glad I tried these out.  </li>
      <li>I tried it on my brows and it did ok with removing the hairs but didn&#x27;t get all of them.</li>
      <li>and that was a better investment for me.</li>
      <li>but like all waxing, the more you do it, the easier and more tolerable it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I think Nad&#x27;s wax strips does a better work.</li>
      <li>calming wipes are ok for getting the excess wax off your skin, but the word &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34; is a joke.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stencil for gum paste / fondant is really cool. Follow the directions in placing your rolled our product to be cut. Strips of product rolled out, then place letter needed across the strip and cut.SO...It will look like a \\&quot;T\\&quot; shape&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Lay the strip of fondant vertical and funky letter horizontal across the strip and wah lah! Carefully remove the letter, using improvised tool if it sticks. 1/8\\&quot; thick works best.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used this product -- I can&#x27;t, because it is NOT hypoallergenic, as marketed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who have an allergy to wax (like I do) are generally allergic to pine rosin (called many other names, including colophony). This ingredient is also found in different kind of \\&quot;band-aids\\&quot; -- it&#x27;s what makes them sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; product actually contains pine rosin, so probably most people who have had an allergic reaction to wax WILL have a reaction to this product!</li>
    <li> I used this product to wax my eyebrows and it did remove the unwanted hair,  however,  it unfortunately also removed several large chunks of my skin.  I now have one large scab on my left eyebrow and several little scabs on my right.  I am not pleased.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Sally Hansen strips, but these are much less messy and don&#x27;t leave any residue. They work very well at getting all the hair.</li>
    <li> Better than blistering depilatory creams and not as painful as plucking individual hairs out with tweezers.  But not cost-effective. Strips are narrow like a bandaid. My facial hair isn&#x27;t in a line or in a group. So I use a whole strip to root out maybe 2 hairs.  I used 5 stips the first time i used the product.  I didn&#x27;t even do my upper lip area. I use a threading tool now &amp; am satisfied with that</li>
    <li> I have tried ALL brands of wax strips and these are the best by far.  of course it HURTS but the part I love about these strips is that it actually STICKS to hair and the hair comes off with one pull.  Other strips Ive tried through the years leaves stray hairs and you have to go BACK over it with another strip (which leaves your skin looking red and burned) or painfully tweeze them.  I love this product so much Ive signed up for auto delivery every few months this is definitely the wax strip product I will continue to use as long as my eyebrows grow!</li>
    <li> These strips are very easy to use. The one issue is that Nads does not provide enough wipes (desensitizing/post wax). That said, it&#x27;s still worth it to purchase this and have these at home.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t work worth a plugged nickel.  Even after I exfoliated.  Just ended up with a bunch of goo.</li>
    <li> I received the product at an event I attended  and used it without expecting too much. It works. I used other products and was always frustrated as the results were never satisfying. However with these strips I managed to get the same result I get after seeing a professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the attached instructions - you will do it right. Great product!!! I will get it again to avoid paying for a professional spa service.</li>
    <li> I tried veet and other wax products and this one is by far the strongest and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. This also does not stick to your skin like most wax strips. It comes right off! I think I will keep on buying this one.</li>
    <li> They work on the fine hairs but not on the thick ones.</li>
    <li> I have hair on my upper lip, on the sides of my face, and my brows go all the way to my hairline.  It&#x27;s emabarrassing to write and it is embarrassing to have, but these take care of it!  Waxing and tweezing hurts, bleach is nasty, but these are a great alternative! They are easy to use.</li>
    <li> The product works ok not as well as I expected and would have liked it to work.  My skin peeled off when using it and was raw.</li>
    <li> I took my eyebrow off with these things! Definitely be careful where you put them. Unfortunately for me, they took my eyebrow off but failed to remove my mustache! I can&#x27;t figure out how they can completely take out my rather thick eyebrow and yet not remove the finer hair on my upper lip!? Oh well, at least once I got the hang of them they made great uni-brow removers. I do cut them to fit first to prevent any mishaps.</li>
    <li> Mostly easy - sometimes have to repeat an area, but truly beats a messy pot.  No offensive odor, no plastic backing.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s perfect, but it&#x27;s the best I have found.&lt;br /&gt;I heat the strips by tucking them into bra or waistband for a few before use - talk about easy. The little pads for afterwards are ok, but any good oil would work - these are included.</li>
    <li> For years I used Hair Off brand wax strips (which left an unnecessary amount of sticky residue &amp; irritated the heck out of my skin). I just assumed that all wax strips left too much residue and that waxing was destined to be painful. Oh a whim, I checked Amazon and found these. After trying them once, I&#x27;m hooked. Not only did these strips grab almost all the hairs; they also left little to no residue, they didn&#x27;t turn my skin bright red, AND the pain was minimal! I trimmed these to make several thinner strips to help make waxing my eyebrows more precise (and to prolong the use of these.) Can&#x27;t recommend these enough!</li>
    <li> Removes unwanted facial hair like a dream - a slightly painful dream but as my sister used to say: Beauty is pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to heat it up par the directions - rubbing it between my palms. Not up and down like one would think but I just kept it in one hand and rubbed it with the base of my palm. I feel like heating it with a hairdryer would make it way too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleansing wipes work very well at removing excess wax and they sooth the irritated skin. All of the hair was removed in one rip each.</li>
    <li> I find the product much easier to use than other brands.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a lot behind that you have to remove.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping these strips would be my solution for upper lip/chin facial hair, but I did not have much luck with them. They come in handy because they are very easy to use, and they do remove some hair, but you will still need to pluck a couple hairs here and there.</li>
    <li> I usually get Sally Hansen products because of the lower price but I was seriously sick of wasting my money on their stuff it always sucks. I took a chance with Nad&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve never used any of their products before. I LOVE these strips! The wipes they give you to make it \\&quot;pain-free\\&quot; don&#x27;t work too well but the soothing after wipes do. All you have to do is rub them between your palms for like 3 seconds, peel apart and then smooth on your upper lip, or wherever you are using them. Then RIP OFF. OUCH! but ooohh la la smooooth :) Great product and I will definitely recommend to my mom, and two sisters as well as all my friends.</li>
    <li> I prefer this over the Sally Hansen facial strips. I like that its cloth style so its easier to warm up in-betweens your hands and you can guide it easier around your lip area, where as the Sally Hansen strips are plastic so its a bit harder to lay down. I feel like you get a better pull with this product but I do break out after usage. I cant think of anything else that would remove the wax besides that oil wipes they provide. I would probably buy again and suffer through the mini breakouts for a few days.</li>
    <li> Ripped my skin off; hairs stayed put.  A week later, I still have scabs and will probably have scars.</li>
    <li> These strips are stickier and work better than the other brands I tried from the drugstore.  The warming with your hands is essential.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few waxing products but always had trouble applying them and getting the results I wanted.  This was easy to use and actually worked.  I was very pleased.  I highly recommend it.  I took someone else&#x27;s advice to heat the strips up by putting them up to a light bulb.  Worked great.</li>
    <li> does what it promises</li>
    <li> I had been using Veet strips...they changed the formula and were no longer any good.  Tried this and was quite pleased...I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I loved because works and I don&#x27;t have any kind of reaction after using it. It really does the job that it supposed to do!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased some of these strips to clean up my eyebrows. The fine hairs around them were driving me crazy and were so annoying to try and pluck a few at a time. These worked great! I rubbed my hands together really fast and they heated up well. I cut the strips in half the short way before getting them ready to make it easier when working on my brows. I did not use any soothing ointment beforehand. I found that they hardly hurt. I made sure to pull my skin tight though. They did leave a little bit of residue and a few stray hairs behind though. I found the after care wipes to be too greasy so I did not use them. The only thing I did not like, was how it was difficult to get the wax close to where you wanted it to be, due to all the cloth surrounding it. Great product and definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Waste of money...I heated the strips on a light bulb several times and it never worked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used facial wax strips and hot wax before.  These are the absolute worst.&lt;br /&gt;They do not completely remove the hair, but leave wax residue that is difficult to remove.  Don&#x27;t count on good results the first application, nor the second.&lt;br /&gt;Worthless and end result is burning sensation where applied and removed.  Oil wipes remove the wax, but do not relieve the burn.</li>
    <li> what a waste of money. the only thing these removed was money from my wallet.</li>
    <li> These worked very well the first few times but after that they left my skin dry and flaky for the following week. By the time it healed they hair would already be starting to grow back. For now I am using sugar wax and tweezerman tweezers.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove all of the hair, but definitely helps!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this but the girls in the family do, they love it. Saves lots of money from going to the waxing salon. Make sure you pull near the skin not up or you can rip your skin.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin do NOT buy this product! It said hypo allergenic so i though id give it a try, with in a few days my face had broken out in SEVERE hives and it was so swollen i had to go to the hospital! Worst experience of my life!</li>
    <li> Ok. They do their work fine but r too small</li>
    <li> I have coarse chin hairs and these strips do the job. I rub the strips between my fingers but also heat them up on the light just a bit too then I press them in and keep the strips on for about a minute and snatch. I remove excess wax with baby oil on a cotton ball and clean the skin with alcohol on a cotton ball. It&#x27;s smooth and hair free. 😬👍</li>
    <li> I have hirsutism, and these work pretty well for me. Worth a try.</li>
    <li> I just love that wax strips!!! So easy to use, no mess at all!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t at all impressed by these.  I found them difficult to use and that I had to use more of them in order to get the job done.  My normal brand is Sally Hansen, and I&#x27;ll be going back to them.</li>
    <li> I used these twice before without problems. During the third time, the strip barely stuck above my lip so nothing came off when I ripped it off. I went over the upper lip area again and it took off my skin. Yeah there&#x27;s a warning about it, but you don&#x27;t assume it&#x27;s going to rip off your face. It felt like a huge burn and putting on moisturizer made it burn more. It took 3 days for it to crust over and just felt really uncomfortable. I couldn&#x27;t smile because I could feel the skin splitting &amp; painful when I move my mouth! I couldn&#x27;t wear make up because you can see the crusting skin. It looks like I have raw third degree burns or something and it also took off the skin on the very top of my lip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically now I&#x27;m trying to use anti-scar gel to heal it up without visible signs and I would be wary to use this product again.</li>
    <li> one of the best facial wax ever... pulling everything and I am loving it. I use it every other day to maintain. I&#x27;m planning to purchase more. I wish they had this in larger packaging. Highly recommended for stubborn dark hair.</li>
    <li> It does not remove all the hair on my face. I have to use it a second round at times.</li>
    <li> didnt work well for me.  I have vey fine body hair.</li>
    <li> This product costs more than it is worth unfortunately. I have tried it several times and it takes doing it five or six times before getting all the hair.</li>
    <li> Bought these on a whim, biggest mistake ever. While this product did take the embarrassing hairs off my upper lip, it also took off even more embarrassing PATCHES OF SKIN from my upper and top lip. So now I have bright red patches, and it&#x27;s very obvious that I was trying to wax my face. If that&#x27;s not bad enough, I woke up the next morning with ACNE all over my upper lip. It&#x27;s not a charming combo, and I wish I&#x27;d never even looked at these waxing strips. Nad&#x27;s, I hate you.</li>
    <li> not a good quality wipe and wax. wipes smell chemical because they are chemical oil, not natural oil. veet is much much better quality</li>
    <li> Painful but works excellent. I put them in my waistband for 10-20min before use to warm them up to body temperature. I know sounds strange but try it!</li>
    <li> I was a little doubtful that these would work. I&#x27;m glad I took the gamble. They work just as well as getting it done at the salon with hot wax only cheaper. Of course it does leave a few little hairs behind just like at the salon. Which you can easily pluck them away. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no messy wax equipment you need to buy. Just use these strips; apply to the desired area, press firmly and pull quickly (yeah it hurts, but nothing more than at the salon). It comes with oil pads to remove the left over wax. These little pads felt like they were dry, but once I used it the oil did it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> A college roommate was the first to convert me to wax after I spent my whole teenage years bleaching(the only thing my mother would let me do, and only after begging and crying after being teased so much), and she used the Sally Hansen strips.  They worked pretty well, but I found that rubbing them between my hands did not heat up enough. But the same roommate also gave me the tip to use a hairdryer to warm them which did work. I in turn recommended the SH to my sister, and we both used them for a good ten years before she found these, and insisted that I try them. Wow!  What a difference!  Fist of all, the fabric strip is way more comfortable than the SH plastic, and it conforms to your face better too.  Plus, the SH did have a tendency to irritate the skin, and while this does a bit too, much much less so. My sister has very sensitive skin(mine less so) and swears by these, and so I can&#x27;t say that you too will not have a problem, I can say they are a lot more gentle. After all, there is really nothing inherently gentle about ripping out hair, no matter where it is or what you use.  The other thing about the SH that was annoying is that I only used them for my upper lip, and so would have to cut and shape the rest of the pieces since the only kind I could ever find came in a multi-use pack.  A minor inconvenience, but still. The only thing that is annoying about the Nads, is that they only give you a couple of those wax removing pads.  However, the SH brand gave you an entire small bottle of wax remover that I hardly ever made a dent in, which I subsequently spent years stashing away in my bathroom cabinet, so now I have an ample supply!  I knew I was saving those silly little bottles of blue oil for a reason!  Anyhow, baby oil does the same thing, so really not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;  Bottom line, these work pretty well.  Sure you&#x27;ll probably get better results getting professorially waxed, but for an at home, easy and convenient kit these certainly do the trick and are the best I&#x27;ve found.  I&#x27;m pretty sure if you are trying these it&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t have the time and/or money to go to the salon, or just can&#x27;t be bothered.  A clean, dry, freshly washed face works best, and so I try and do it right after a shower.  I&#x27;ve also had success using baby powder to dry the skin before using these and that works too if you are in a rush and are a bit oily.  Also, (and perhaps the most important tip I have)I learned years ago to carefully apply lip balm before waxing to protect your lips.  I learned this the hard way, after I ripped off a piece of my upper lip during a hasty and ill fated hair removal in my early years as a novice.  Now THAT ladies, hurts, (and ain&#x27;t too pretty either!&lt;br /&gt;I usually pick these up at either target or rite aid, and I can&#x27;t remember the price, but I think that the current price here of just under $10 for a two pack seems fair. It&#x27;s an add on but I have other stuff to buy anyway.  I&#x27;m a 1/2 hour from Rite Aid, and 1 1/2 hrs from Target, and cant get them locally, so ordering these through Amazon at this price is convenient, even if I&#x27;m paying a few cents more.</li>
    <li> I have used Surgi wax strips ([[ASIN:B00138Q4OO B00138Q4OO]] before and I think Nad&#x27;s wax strips does a better work. Its much cleaner but I have noticed that my hair comes out after every 4 days :(</li>
    <li> Yes, it works and yes the area waxed is then totally smoothe. Rip the strips off in the right direction and rip them off fast.  I did this on my upper lip and it did the job. The wipe/soothing cloth is nice but you don&#x27;t need it. Use a little aloe vera or baby powder or baby oil immediately after let it sit for 3-5 min. to help calm the area and any redness.  Wash the area with soap and water...you&#x27;ll be smoothe to go!</li>
    <li> I recently decided to do hair removal myself to save money. I tried these out and they do remove the hair from my upper lip. Virtually no pain. However it does leave the gooey mess afterwards even with the after wipes. And by the next day my upper lip has broken out in small pimples. Not huge but definitely noticeable but it did remove the hair. I tried it on my brows and it did ok with removing the hairs but didn&#x27;t get all of them. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase these again. I&#x27;ll use them maybe when I&#x27;m in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I use these on my eyebrows and upper lip and they work great for the money. It takes a time or two to get the hang of it, but I cut these to fit the area I want waxed and it works well. You definitely need to have your skin pulled taut if you expect it to remove hairs. I only rub the little strips between my palms for maybe 10 seconds and that seems to do the trick. I don&#x27;t like the oil soothing wipes because they seem to be on rough paper and that isn&#x27;t exactly soothing for just-waxed-skin, so I just use some aloe lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is, and maybe this isnt with the product but just non-heated waxing in general, is that the skin outside of the area you normally wax/pluck is very sensitive and if you&#x27;re not careful you&#x27;ll take off a layer and be red and sore for a few days! I&#x27;ve made this mistake a few times..</li>
    <li> They do ok but only on more superficial hairs. They are ineffective on the coarser chin hairs we women get as we age, sadly. They leave the normal residue but i do like that they are one piece and you just warm them by body heat.</li>
    <li> This is my fave waxing product that you can get at the store. It is so simple to use, makes waxing a breeze. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions &amp; they did not work at all. This is the first time trying these.  A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Had to use 4 strips on each side. Only partially  took hair off.</li>
    <li> These are the best wax strips I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve previously always bought GiGi honey strips and just dealt with the fact that they completely missed coarse hairs but were great at removing lighter softer hairs. But I just tried the Nad&#x27;s strips last night and along with being a nicer strip made of fabric (rather than GiGi&#x27;s clear plastic ones which were hard to see on the bathroom sink, often fluttered to the floor, then stuck there haha), in one try I was able to pull off all the hair on my upper lip including the soft and coarse hairs. Awesome! A facial wax strip that actually works. I love these for travelling too. They&#x27;re so convenient. I will definitely be buying again :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this item, &amp; it works great. I am scared of waxing, but it&#x27;s the best form of hair removal.</li>
    <li> This is good for in between professional waxes. It works fairly well and is clean and neat. No wax to melt. You have to rub them vigorously between your hands to warm them up. But it does work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and this one is the best for me.  Is gentle on the skin and does a good job of removing the hair.  It is almost impossible to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> I used to use Sally Hansens wax strips but these work much better. They hardly hurt. I will purchase again</li>
    <li> I always read mixed reviews about these but I love them. Make sure you rub them between your hands and really warm them up for a few seconds before peeling the strips apart. I fold the edge over so I can see exactly where the wax is going. I get great results with them and have also tried their wax pen and like these a lot better. Plus no mess!</li>
    <li> it works fine, I used the hair blower to worm it and it did a good job without causing irritation. They are packaged in pair so you end up using 2 at time.</li>
    <li> first of all, it says right on the box Not Suitable for Brows, so why are people trying to use these for eyebrows? let me give you some advice - NEVER, EVER do your brows yourself! i wish someone had told teenage me that, it would have saved me years of growing my brows back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as for using these as they are intended, yes they do work. i heated my strips with my hair dryer on low and waxed my upper lip-i have a peach fuzz blonde stache, but it annoys me so i wanted it gone. it didn&#x27;t get every single hair, but it got most of it, and that is good enough for me. if this happens, wait a few days for your skin to calm down, then wax off the remaining hair. yeah it hurts, you&#x27;re ripping hair out of your body! but like all waxing, the more you do it, the easier and more tolerable it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the calming wipes are ok for getting the excess wax off your skin, but the word &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34; is a joke. then again i have sensitive skin, so my lip was red for a few hours after the waxing, which didn&#x27;t suprise me at all.</li>
    <li> Ok, here&#x27;s the deal. I was EXTREMELY skeptical of this product, given that I have ripped off half my skin with other self-waxing strips before, but I needed to save some money so I gave Nad&#x27;s Facial Wax Strips a try. Other customer reviews say that these strips don&#x27;t get all the hair off, and while it did take me a few tries, these things eventually worked. I went through about 4 strips trying to get my lady &#x27;stache gone, and it eventually was gone. Half of my skin isn&#x27;t ripped off. AND my face doesn&#x27;t burn like it usually does when I get professionally waxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: I didn&#x27;t use those crappy oil pad things that come in the box. I used clinique make-up remover to get the wax off, then I washed my face with Cetaphil daily facial cleanser and warm water. My face has never felt this good after a waxing!</li>
    <li> These strips are the fastest easiest way to wax away the unwanted lip fuzz!  No heating, no cloth strips, just rub the pre-waxed strips between your hand and use.  Nothing could be faster, easier or more efficient!</li>
    <li> This product leaves little red marks where ever you wax - which kind of defeats the purpose of waxing. I even used the little oil pads afterwards that are supposed to help with that. Nope. Also, they don&#x27;t give you nearly as many of the oil pads as they do strips, so unless you buy more, your skin will end up really irritated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairy guy, and in order to not have people think i am wolverine with a unibrow i have to do some manscaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strips are really easy to use. You can warm them on your hands (i just put them on top of the convection oven for 30 seconds). Apply to the area and then forcefully remove AGAINST the grain of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not really painful as long as you follow up with some cooling lotion like aloe vera etc. And i find myself using one strip at least twice on the same area (maybe i just don&#x27;t have good technique yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come with an oil that helps to remove any excess wax. If you run out - just use baby oil, it works pretty much the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again!</li>
    <li> It really is embarrassing to write a review for this since everybody and their brother will know you have a &#x27;stache problem (That you are trying to keep hidden) however the products works so well I figured I should since it seems to be getting some flack here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I tried lots of other products and nothing really worked for me. Bleach, which hurt a surprising amount and did not last long, tweezing which took too long and was way painful, and the chemical gel things which irritated my skin to no end. This was a Godsend. Yes, it hurts but so does everything else. Beauty, in general, hurts so deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several tips I have: don&#x27;t bother rubbing it between your hands to warm it up. My hands are always cold so this was not effective. Instead I put it up to my bathroom light bulbs which really got the strips warm. Also, pull the strip in the opposite direction of the hair growth. I know lots of people complain that there are not enough wipes but I just use either baby lotion or vitamin E lotion afterward. The desensitizing stuff doesn&#x27;t really work anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have went to a nail salon twice to wax my facial hair it was worth it but I hate the long waiting and the starring from other women like they are seeing this for the first time, the salon charges $15. I have done Electrolysis and laser hair removal but waiting for my next appointment sucks I often want to rid these hairs immediately so i trim b4 my appointments sometimes i pluck and most of the time i bleach. I prefer Bleaching and electrolysis treatments. Bleaching my upper lip is good I can barely see the hair but when i bleach my side burns and chin sometimes i can tell especially when the light or sunlight shines on my face. I have Black hair and my complexion is between pale and fair so when I bleach my hairs they look yellow so it is very noticeable when someone is up close even 4feet away.&lt;br /&gt;******These wax strips are perfect for me :)******My first time using them were 3days ago. They are fragrance free which is great and they leave my skin nice and smooth. My skin is very sensitive to fragrance and other products so i have to be careful what i use on my skin anywhere on my body. I have eczema and terrible allergies that i deal with everyday. I am Glad I found these facial wax strips. Yes it does hurt a little but its tolerable. It saves me from waiting in a salon, the stares and from the embarrassment of men noticing the hairs. I really don&#x27;t like my boyfriend looking at my face because of my facial hair. But now i can hide it better. I can carry these in my purse just in case. The light in the bathroom is different from the light outside. I wax my facial hair in my bedroom by my window using a small mirror I can see the hairs i want to remove better like this. These strips are a quick solution for my hair problems.Its easy to use it works and its not messy.</li>
    <li> Easy to use once you figure out the optimum temperature that makes the wax just soft enough to be effective. Rub it between your palms a couple times before use, and it should work well. Not painful once you know what to expect with waxing. Going with five stars because of the ease and convenience of use. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quick and relatively painless way of removing unwanted facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Be careful if you have sensitive skin. This might cause minor redness. It would be best to try it on skin apart from your face to test it out.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in these strips.  They don&#x27;t work very well at all.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing them again, period</li>
    <li> The best facial wax strips I&#x27;ve found, but they do make me break out a little.</li>
    <li> I wish That i could give this product 0 stars. The strips leave sores all along the side of my lip and upper lip. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Broke out after one use</li>
    <li> I have used these strips before and I found them much better than facial wax. I would have liked it better if I could buy just one pack at a time.</li>
    <li> Work good.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate skin.</li>
    <li> I will use nothing else to take care of my upper lip. I have been using this product for 7 years and counting.  100x cheaper than a \\&quot;professional waxing\\&quot; job and 95% as effective. Plus it takes 3 minutes to do from start to finish and you are done! The more you use this product, the better you get understanding how to use it best, the better your results become every time.  Watch out for double waxing the same area twice (especially triple waxing!), this could cause some skin damage.  Not the worst thing in the world, as it is temporary, but it is not the prettiest thing for the time being while it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other strips similar to these like Veet and Nair.  Only Nad&#x27;s gives results you can be happy about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my wax strips in half since I only need half a strip to get one job done.  Talk about cost effective..!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Walgreens in a five million will carry these, so I stock up on Amazon..</li>
    <li> These remove facial hair effectively and without leaving much residue. I like them.</li>
    <li> DO NOT GET THESE!! I&#x27;ve been waxing for YEARS and when I decided to use these instead of going to my lady it left my skin under my lip RAW! It looks like a rug burn! I have been putting a lot of makeup to cover it until it heals. Don&#x27;t waste your money and your skin!</li>
    <li> These strips work really well! I just waxed my upper lip area and it only took about 5 minutes and it got every hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to use, have no smell and left very little wax residue on my skin. Even though I have sensitive skin and it did sting to pull the strip off - my skin is not irritated or red from using the wax strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One double sided strip did my whole upper lip area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> First of all of all, I really was not satified with the size of the product. The actully area where the wax was the strip was way to small, compaired to other brands like nair or sally hansen. The was was to hard, even after contunous rubbing inbetween my hands. Even though the product was some what effective, it was not effective enough for slighly thicker, dark little hairs.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions for facial hair removal with Nads.  They don&#x27;t work!  All that happened is my skin got all gummy from the wax strip but left the hair behind.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.  Women who have facial hair are always looking for a terrific new product for easy and fast removal.  Nads is definately not it!</li>
    <li> I would give NEGATIVE stars! these strips ripped my skin off!  So painful and I look like a burn victim with bright red patches on my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THESE.</li>
    <li> These strips are the best I&#x27;ve used! They are fabric, which allows them to lay on your face (I used them on my upper lip). I followed the directions, which are the same as any other strips. They removed all the hair! Well worth it!!</li>
    <li> Right now these are my go to waxing strips. The material in the strip is really where all the difference and success is. I always thought waxing was a crock of s*** because Sallys plastic ones just don&#x27;t get the job done. But these really do. Like any waxing strips, the first lay isn&#x27;t necessarily going to get it but it does get it done eventually (2 or 3 tries). Of course it hurts, its beauty. I just hate that they are so hard to find in drugstores. So I have to order them here. A drag. But these really work well.</li>
    <li> I have been using these facial wax strips for over a year. They aren&#x27;t perfect, but honestly they are the BEST facial wax strips out there! I have used wax strips from Sally Hansen and Veet, and they don&#x27;t remove hair as much and as well as Nad&#x27;s. Again, these wax strips aren&#x27;t perfect (sometimes a strip doesn&#x27;t remove any hair at all, but it could me because I&#x27;m pulling from a bad angle or I didn&#x27;t rub the strips hard enough before use). BUT BELIEVE ME these strips work better than the other facial wax strips!</li>
    <li> removes face hair very well on me. and I dont have to press/rip off hard. if u press too hard, of course it will hurt your little face</li>
    <li> I have a pitbull in the front yard couldn&#x27;t find the item but I don&#x27;t think it was because of the dog since other bigger items were delivered and dropped there, I can just think of bad service.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 95 year old mother who wanted me to pluck the odd hairs that grow on her chin.  They work great!  And are a lot more fun than trying to pluck someone else&#x27;s chin!</li>
    <li> These strips literally took patches of my skin off. My peach fuzz was much less embarrassing than the constant red mustache I now have where the skin is healing. Will likely end up throwing the rest of the strips away.</li>
    <li> The wax strips was not effective in removing facial hair. I used over 5 strips and it barely took any hair off. The next day my face was still read and looked brused. The \\&quot;calming\\&quot; after wipe for my face gave me a HUGE and embarassing allergic reaction that lasted for days. I had to see the doctor. I would NEVER recommed this product. Espially it said for sensitive skin!!!</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, and even this formula broke me out into a really itchy rash.</li>
    <li> Read the directions on these babies. If you do it right, they are absolutely the best facial hair wax system there is. I have tried all sorts of ooey, gooey hot and cold waxes, highly recommended to me by friends and even professionals. These work better than any other product I have tried and leave no mess. Nads is made from natural ingredients that don&#x27;t cause irritation or breakouts, and I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin. My lady-stache is blonde and barely noticeable but of course I hate it. Even with fine, shorter hairs, these take it all off. What you need to do for the perfect wax session: warm the strip kit in your hand for 30 sec-1 min. Then pull it apart. It should come apart easily and be a little gooey (if it&#x27;s not or it&#x27;s crackly, you didn&#x27;t warm it long enough). Apply the strip in the direction of the hair, stroke the back of the strip in the direction of the hair so it warms to your upper lip. (5-10 times). Then yank quickly in the opposite direction! Have a friend do it if you are shy. Quickness is the key.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. Who would I recommend this product to? Hairy people of course! I hate that reviews have a minimum number of words for a valid review!</li>
    <li> Simple and easy to use. I do get some minor breakouts after using them - but this happens with most all waxes for me.</li>
    <li> I chose the five star because Nads works&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to do my own waxing if you don&#x27;t mind&lt;br /&gt;The hair comes back less and less&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get that from a year of waxing at a salon, just a thinner wallet</li>
    <li> I like using these, they are effective and affordable and best of all, not messy.</li>
    <li> I used it according to directions and the wax was so sticky I couldn&#x27;t remove it (I had to use the oily wipes that come with the wax to remove the wax from my face).  It didn&#x27;t get rid of my facial hair.</li>
    <li> Being a girl with super dark hair is hard, especially in the summer time.  I can&#x27;t use hot wax because I have really sensitive skin and it will literally be red for hours and bumpy/blistery the next day.  Those creams that dissolve your hair?  My hair stays and my skin burns instead, it&#x27;s not a nice look for me.  That is why I thought these would be a good alternative, since you heat them with your own body heat getting them not so hot.  You rub them between your palms to get them toward your own body heat, rest them on your desired area and smooth it out...and rip it off.  Not a super pleasant experience, but you can go through MUCH worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked these the first few times I tried them, but after the third attempt, it seemed less effective.  For some reason (most likely my own laziness) I couldn&#x27;t get them hot enough.  And so I ended up ripping out some skin and was left with tiny scars.  NOW, I thought this was probably my own fault, so after that I took care to heat them up really well before putting them on.  But they haven&#x27;t worked the same since the first two or so times.  They rip out skin and leave some hair behind, along with a bit of wax.  A good way to get off that wax is cocoa butter, way better than the oily wipes they provide.  SO disappointing, but I will continue trying.  Maybe I&#x27;ll heat them on my laptop or something like that, and that will help.  But like I said, I can&#x27;t put super hot wax on my face, so this is still the best alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 24 strips in the box, and I rip those in half, because they are pretty big, and that makes 48, not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t too impressed with these wax strips.  I only got them because I thought it would be quicker than trying to pluck some of the hair that I get on my chin, but they just didn&#x27;t work for me.  It would take out some of the fine hair that I wasn&#x27;t looking to get, but not the dark hairs I was actually trying to get rid of.  I even made sure that the hairs met the measurements specified on the box, but nope was only left with some nice red marks.  Could be the product is just not for me, might work better for the mustache area, but definitely not the chin.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t what I expected, but that&#x27;s my fault. I have the Nads gel pen, but I ran out of strips long before then pen ran out. I ordered these thinking they were just cotton strips that would be good for eyebrow waxing. They actually have Nads gel on them. I tried them out and thought they worked very well. The way they are shaped, they&#x27;re probably not ideal for eyebrows, since it&#x27;s a little harder to use them for shaping. But, they&#x27;re great for ... uh, other facial areas that will remain nameless. The only thing I don&#x27;t think is really great is that they come in peel-apart packaging where, in order to use one, you have to open two. I don&#x27;t have that much facial hair; I don&#x27;t even have that much facial space, so it seems kind of wasteful. But, all-in-all, a good purchase.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, the strips did not do what they were supposed to. I tried for several days because I thought I may have been doing something wrong, but in the end, they just did not remove the hair at all. Even worse, there was so much wax left behind that it was nearly impossible to wash off. I honestly had to jump in a hot shower to melt it off of my face. The wipes that come with this product was oily and it did not help remove the wax. What happened instead was my having an oily, slimy feeling face with sticky patches. It didn&#x27;t feel good. I do not recommend this product at all. I wish I would have listened to the other reviewers before I bought this product.</li>
    <li> I like how easy these are.  I make my own hot wax and store it in the fridge.  I wanted to try something easier then heating the wax, cutting the paper and cleaning the stick afterward.  This was so easy and worked great for me, however the area I used it on was red for a few days.  I&#x27;ve never had that happen with my homemade wax.  I cleaned the area well and applied tea trea oil as I always have.  I had to wear concealer and foundation to cover the redness,(I waited 24 hours to let the area try and heal), to go out in public.  So, I am thrilled with how easy it was, but not thrilled with the redness.  I might try them again, but tear the strip off sooner, like after pressing it down, rather then waiting 10 seconds or so to \\&quot;set\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Followed the directions to a T......but didn&#x27;t work for myself nor my daughter.</li>
    <li> I just used this product for the first time, and so far so good. Other similar products are made of a material that looks like the glue on regular tape. This one is s soft wax. It removes almos of the facial hair whereas other similar products don&#x27;t. It did irritated my skin a little, although way less that others do, but I think it was my mistake I applied it twice in those areas. The soothing towelettes are great, they remove the excess easily and they do sooth the skin.</li>
    <li> This product stinks! It pulls like 50 percent of the hairs out. It&#x27;s hard to reuse after the first time.</li>
    <li> This product does not remove hair! Doesn&#x27;t matter if its thick or thin hair. Short or long hair. All it left was a sticky mess and skin irritation. Total waste of money. Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> works great, very pleased!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waxed in the past, but have been doing threading most recently since it seemed to make my upper lip break out a bit less.  I moved away from my threading studio and thought that these sounded good- hypoallergenic and all.  My lip looked great on night 1, and I had a few small bumps by night 2.  Imagine my horror on morning 3 when my lip was covered in pimples- literally, probably 15 of them.  I generally have great skin and rarely get a single pimple at all.  I know better than to touch my face after waxing, and I made sure that my face was completely clean prior to waxing.  Now I&#x27;m stuck trying to cover up this horrible texture and redness with makeup and it still looks horrible.  I&#x27;m using facial masks, acne clearing gels, and whatever home remedies I&#x27;ve ever heard of to try to improve this.  This was a good price, but now I&#x27;m stuck with 2 packs of these pimple packs.</li>
    <li> Fast deliver ! as described very happy got it in time before my trip , perfect  gift , this product does the job, Thank you</li>
    <li> These strips have reallllly easy directions, which is a plus. They would have gotten 5 stars but there didn&#x27;t remove all the hair. Honestly though, after i put it on my lip I sat there for at least 2 minutes psyching myself up to pull it off....so all in all, maybe im just a baby and didnt pull it off fast enough and thats why it didnt fully work. However, I saw a lot of comments complaning about the oil wipes and there not being enough of them, there is 4 and they are HUGE you can easily cut them in half and save half of it in a ziplock if thats whats your mainly worried about.</li>
    <li> All other products like this haven&#x27;t worked for me. This one does, but the after oil stuff gives me a rash. I now use pure apricot oil and love the results.</li>
    <li> Best and most convenient wax strips.  Wish there were some contoured for brows.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work.  I tried several ways to heat the strips.  I also tried to cool them after applied to harden the wax.  Couldn&#x27;t get them to work.</li>
    <li> Much better than creams! And it&#x27;s very effective and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> As to previous reviews, uh duh, yeh, it hurts. What woman&#x27;s regime doesn&#x27;t hurt? But the minor pain is oh so worth it. What takes 30 minutes to do with repeated waxings, is done in two minutes with two quick pulls on each side of the lip. I also totally do agree with the one reviewer, what insane revelation led to a not equivalent amount of desensitizer with the strips? Make it in a gel form or something NADS. Other than that, this 38 year old would DIE without these. Coarse ugly non-feminine stache hair is GONE. Note to youngins.... my niece tried these with me (16 yr. old), not only did they hurt terribly, her face broke out in pimples/sores for a week afterwards. Perhaps these are only for the 30+ crowd.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use on my upper lip.  They only sorta work for me.  It takes much more than one pass.  I have to reapply and rip, reapply and rip, many times, and still not all the hairs are gone.  Perhaps I&#x27;m doing something wrong but I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different techniques.  I&#x27;ve watched videos, and I&#x27;ve tried warming them a lot, warming them less, pressing down a little, pressing down a lot, ripping off in different directions... all with the same results.  Another issue is that maybe I didn&#x27;t let the hairs get long enough for the wax to grab, but who wants to let their lady stache grow out to noticeable proportions before waxing?  Despite the disappointing results, I will probably continue to use them, because it&#x27;s preferable to shaving, and the hairs are so fine they&#x27;re almost impossible to pluck.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay if the hairs are long. Doesn&#x27;t strip the short stuff. Hair breaks off at the skin level so you have to pluck or shave anyway. I&#x27;ll try something else next time and hope it works better.</li>
    <li> I used the Nads facial wax strips as instructed and it removes about 50% of hair for me. I cleaned my face, warmed them up and pressed on my upper lip. I pulled them off quickly. This has been my 3rd time trying them and each time my skin breaks out above my lip. Despite cleaning the wax, re washing my face and using moisturizer w/salicylic acid. I should mention I do have sensitive skin. These are supposed to be okay for sensitive skin. I&#x27;ll keep going to the salon. They just don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so when I would use Sally wax strips they would take a layer of skin off, or cause me to break out.  Nad&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t take your skin off and I rarely break out from the follicles getting infected from the trauma.  This is also the only waxing product I an safely use on my eyebrows - for the same reason.  I still need to pluck, but using this first make my skin self anesthetize so I don&#x27;t feel any pain from plucking.  Been using this for years.  Fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HINT TO THOSE WHO BREAK OUT AFTER WAXING - buy Mario Badescu&#x27;s drying lotion and apply it after you&#x27;ve waxed, washed and moisturized the area.  Leave it on all night and wash it off in the morning.  It not only has mild salicylic acid to stop the follicle from being plugged up, it has camphor and calamine to soothe and calm your skin.  Another product I am never without.  On breakouts, the pimple is gone in 24-48 hours.  And your skin does not dry out from it.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  It worked perfectly.  All hair was removed this first time.  The lotion was wonderful and very soothing.</li>
    <li> Fist off I tried nads about 10 years ago and it works but I noticed after you have opened it the first time you only have about two weeks to use it.  Thought maybe they changed the formula some but nope the wax loses it&#x27;s strength or something like that and doesn&#x27;t stick to your hair effectively.  Only thing I got on the second use was red irritated skin.</li>
    <li> This product is a great time and money saver for me.  It can cost $10-$20 for facial waxing in a salon and plucking was so time consuming for me (my upper lip hair is plentiful!)  So glad I tried these out.  Some plucking after is still required, however, removing most of the hair beforehand using the wax strips saves so much time.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than getting waxed in a salon.  Just follow the directions and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers that the oil pads are pretty much worthless.  They are rough and ineffective, but that doesn&#x27;t matter all that much to me.  I gave the product five stars because it did exactly what I wanted, the cost is good, and I plan to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I tried this product years ago, and finally I decided to stop paying for the brow/lip wax and do it myself again. I loved the strips, very easy and they WORK great! The oil rub for irritations was also a plus. Love this product. Will certainly buy again!</li>
    <li> These wax strips are very small and are not a good investment if you need to wax more than your eyebrows and upper lip. They are also not a good investment if you have coarse hair. If you have fine hair and you won&#x27;t wax more than those little areas you will probably like this product. However, these strips are also cold which means you must warm them up to activate the wax. I did this by rubbing between my palms til they felt warm. This product did not work for me and my needs but they MAY work for you. Please remember you shouldn&#x27;t expect great results if you want to do a larger area like say your chin or neck...it will take you forever and if you have coarse hair please don&#x27;t waste your money. I just went on ahead and bought a warmer and pot wax and that was a better investment for me. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Great product. This does exactly what it advertises. I have not had any problem using them and the wipe that is provided to soothe afterwards is nice.</li>
    <li> These wax strips really did nothing at all for hair removal of even the finest of hair on my face. In addition, I noticed there are only a few of the removal wipes in the box so nowhere near enough of those. I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again as they were just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take off much of the hair on my lip or chin, but did take off a bunch of SKIN!  Left my face bleeding and sore, and with hair still there.  Don&#x27;t use these unless you&#x27;re ok having your skin ripped off and scabs on your face.</li>
    <li> Did not work so well.</li>
    <li> Good price, they&#x27;re cheap so, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I did all the instructions but broke out with a raised red rash on my upper lip and chin. It did remove most of the hair but if I use it again, I will use it on a Friday so the rash will be gone by Monday.</li>
    <li> I chose Nads because I remember hearing the ads some years ago. Now it&#x27;s time for me to remove &amp;#34;unwanted hair&#x27; from my face, meaning the upper lip. First I took a good hot shower to soften the hair. I followed the directions, and got a reasonable bit of hair removed with the waxy strip. I don&#x27;t have much just some noticeable &#x27;sprouts&#x27; here and here, so I had to re position the strip. It took me several tries, and yes, indeed it smarted, off course. I first washed the skin with soap and water, then with the provided treated tissue, again with soap and water, and then a cooling splash of witchhazel.. The redness was gone by the hour I thought of checking, and so was the pain. I still had to do some plucking but that may well be due to my inexperience. I chose wax strips with a bit of pain, to avoid trying hair dissolving products, as I felt the strips would be less irritating the skin in the long run. I liked them. I gave a 4 star rating because I don&#x27;t love the pain. It might lessen as I get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> This product works good, but my skin is too sensitive to use it.</li>
    <li> This product burned my face.</li>
    <li> I love the new and improved wax strips they no longer leave all that wax residue on your face.  Would highly recommend these to all of my family and friends and I will definitely continue to buy these and very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> im 13 and i just finished using these. one word, amazing!!!!!! omg these are awesome. follow directions after put on wipes to get rid of all of the wax and your good. let the soothing wipes formuloa sink into your skin and your done! quick easy and only painfull for a second. anyway, i would totally get these again, and i just had to do a review on these. i finally got rid of my mustache! good luck!!!!! :)</li>
    <li> Terrible!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone trying this on there face your risking sever damage to your face. Go get it done professionally. Personally id rather have a mustache then have had to go through this painful experience!  I used this stuff and it tore my skin under my lip it was almost like a 3 degree burn. It was painful and i just wanted to cry my face looks like I burned it with a curling iron,it&#x27;s still in the healing process and it&#x27;s now peeling it doesn&#x27;t look pretty. I will never self wax my face ever again!</li>
    <li> I tried these because I thought they would be easier than the traditional method using warmed wax and because I had seen them featured in a magazine article  -- They did not work and it&#x27;s obvious the magazine article was just a veiled endorsement.  I&#x27;m now going back to the traditional, tried-and-true method...</li>
    <li> i have used this item for a very long time,it was the very best i ever purchased that is until i received my last order,they are not the same,the wax strip is smaller and not at all sticky,therefore they are useless...thanks alot nad&#x27;s for turning a perfect product into junk...ZERO STARS</li>
    <li> Product does remove hair, even fine hair. The problem is that hair grows back as early as next day. I switched to a different product, and problem solved!</li>
    <li> This product, to be blunt, does not work. It leaves a sticky residue on but takes nothing off. Keep plucking!</li>
    <li> Love these! They remove the hair from my upper lip completely! They leave my skin very very smooth and with very little residue. Much better than the plastic backing waxing strips in my opinion because they are much more flexible.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like these wax strips: when pulled apart, they are very sticky and when used don&#x27;t really pull out any hairs.I am going back to my old product:Nair.</li>
    <li> I found these strips not to be nearly as harsh as using plain wax.  They are very easy to use,  The only issue is it did leave a few hairs and I had to tweeze them off.  But all in all I found them to be a good product.</li>
    <li> The strips are easier to separate than the Nair strips (they are cloth-like rather than clear plastic), and they work better than the Nair, removing just about every visible hair after a few applications of the same strip to my 40-something but relatively fine upper lip fuzz.  They do leave a tacky residue (as does the Nair), but it can be removed easily with any type of oil - baby oil, castor oil, heck, even olive oil.</li>
    <li> Ouch! is right! OUCH... these strips no matter how you use them HURT when you rip it off your face. The wax is messy too. It doesn&#x27;t just get on your face hair it gets all around and boy does it hurt when you pull it off. AND to top it off, it did NOT take my face hair off. So all that ouching for nothing. Ugh! yucky.</li>
    <li> My son unfortunately suffers from a uni-brow. Since he was entering high school this year he was very self conscience about it so I figured I&#x27;d give these a try based on other reviews. I was not disappointed. They worked really well. My son said they didn&#x27;t hurt much at all and was so thrilled that it resolved his problem. Its nice that you&#x27;re able to cut them, to adjust them perfectly. Would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, very practical! You can use any oil to clean the residue! I used olive oil to clean after applying the wax.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from a local pharmacy store. The stuff peeled off the strip and left all of the wax on my skin and hair... I had to soak in oil and pick at it for an hour! OUCH! Well, it definitely DOES stick to the hair (now if only it would stick to the strip too.)</li>
    <li> This product is way more than i expected!! It worked great. Even for a first time user, never waxed anything in my life before, and my lip is smooth, soft and hair free! Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have good luck these types of products.  I have very fine hair so it may just not work with my hair type.  It works better for my eye brows than it does for other facial hair.</li>
    <li> Strips are very flexible when heated.</li>
    <li> I will say, these ripped every single tiny bit of fuzzy hair out of my face, better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after using them three days ago, I still have fading red marks (it&#x27;s charming, I have a red moustache, big red spot in between my eyebrows, and a red dot on my chin). Today, after 2 days of it being sore &amp; unattractive, I also have a spot on my lip that now has a thin scab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used them according to directions, never did more than one strip on an area. This was just so sticky it damaged my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have quite sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve used a number of waxing products in the past &amp; never seen anything like this. I usually expect to be sore for a minute, red for 12 hours, but never more than that. I&#x27;ve also used &amp; loved Nad&#x27;s gel system in the past (I think it&#x27;s sugar?), I somehow just thought this would be comparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend them, unless you have far tougher skin than mine! This is disturbing enough that I plan on contacting the company, they should know if people have issues like this.</li>
    <li> Nice to be able to wax at home. Saves time and money not having to go to a cosmetologist. The strips work great.</li>
    <li> These are an ok product. I like to cut them in half and use them on mustache and Big toe hair (TMI?).&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re not really good on eyebrows though. It&#x27;s difficult to make sure you&#x27;re not applying a perfect rectangle on the wrong area of your arched eyebrow, and they have difficulty pulling out those coarser brow hairs anyhow.</li>
    <li> These work great!  As another reviewer stated, warm them up by holding them to a lightbulb for several seconds.  Otherwise, I use them as directed and it removed all hair.  Yes, it was a bit painful but any waxing will be.  The pain doesn&#x27;t last long and the results are well worth it!</li>
    <li> Like this product very much.  It is very easy to use, relatively painless and does what it advertises to do.  Will buy this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> This product works well. Just make sure to warm it up with your hand enough. When putting it on area, make sure to rub it in very well before pulling. Good product.</li>
    <li> I was purchased this product else were before, however, they started not restocking this Item. I deal with sensitive skin from lotions and shampoos to jewelry yet this products does not bother me at all.</li>
    <li> works as expected, the wipes feel greesy but the strips work exactly as expected, hair gone little wax left behind</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I have been meaning to for this product.  This is the best wax ever.  I have tried all of them.  Sally Hanson was literally like a piece of tape and removed no hair, the other brand I can’t recall but it didn&#x27;t work much better, it was a major brand though.  Nads is a dream come true, I actually use in lieu of a professional now.  My tip is to warm with a hairdryer on low, this will get the wax warm.  I will use one strip several times and if I need to will use a hairdryer to warm the strip again.  The result is the same as the salon and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I also want to mention that I have used these for my boyfriend’s neck and back and also it worked very well, I noticed a comment that said it wasn&#x27;t strong enough, try warming with the hairdryer it’s amazing!</li>
