      <li>this was presented as a Large pill dispenser.  </li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t as large as I&#x27;d hoped it would be but it holds all I need it to hold each week for my dog&#x27;s medications.</li>
      <li>Size is not what I would consider large.</li>
      <li>I might need to find smaller medicine to fit all of my supplements.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but this is the same cheap box,</li>
      <li>Very durable.</li>
      <li>The individual holders are large and roomy, the letters are easy to read, and the compartments open easily and seal tightly.  </li>
      <li>I love this little pill organizer!  </li>
      <li>Nice size yet small enough to take with you if need be.</li>
      <li>The container as a whole, however, is not ridiculously big.  </li>
      <li>This case replaced my old one, on which the lettering had rubbed away.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s big enough to hold one large multivitamin and three smaller pills</li>
      <li>This box is hard to open, and I have rather strong fingers.</li>

<li> This box is hard to open, and I have rather strong fingers.</li>
<li> this one is sturdy and will last a long time the price was competitive.</li>
<li> The only complaint is that it really shouldn&#x27;t be considered \\&quot;large;\\&quot; I have to restock it twice a day because it doesn&#x27;t hold all my doses.</li>
<li> It fits four or five larger vitamins and a few smaller ones.</li>
<li> It seems to be getting a little easier over time, but I wonder how long the case will last.</li>
<li> Does what it is supposed to do, lids seem durable unlike other products where the lids tend to fail quickly.</li>
<li> But it is designed for medical use, so many of it users are sick and/or old people, who are physically weak.  </li>
<li> Once a month, when the four are empty, I fill them all with a selection of all of the pills I take each morning.</li>
<li> They should state travel or purse size, not large as this was misleading.</li>
<li> I take vitamins and other medication each day.</li>
<li> My complaint about new one I just received is that the lip you pull up on to open each section is just too small, making it very hard to open.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not skipping through a field singing love songs about the thing, but it holds the pills and doesn&#x27;t have any annoying lock mechanism for me to pry out of it.  </li>
<li> With this little tool, I can see at a glance if I did or not and take care of it.  </li>
<li> Take pills from one section in every morning and forget about the trouble checking the pills rest of the days for four weeks.  </li>
<li> This is not worth the money seriously.</li>
<li> Very little to say about this.</li>
<li> I was too lazy to go to dollar store which I should&#x27;ve gone to.</li>
<li> but I find the lids difficult to open.  </li>
<li> Just too small for my pills and vitamins.</li>
<li> A pill reminder which requires physical strength is an absurd.</li>
<li> It is small.  </li>
<li> and he&#x27;d be calling at least once a day until they were in his hands.  </li>
<li> I was thinking it was at least medium</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;it is very small - holds may 4 vitamins</li>
<li> I donated it to charity, unused, for those with one or two pills --  little ones!!!</li>
<li> i think we&#x27;ve all seen one so ill skip the description.</li>
<li> and now it looks dirty :(</li>
<li> Disappointed</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, however it&#x27;s cheap and gets the job done. It is not the easiest thing to pry open.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have found these.  This was just the size I was looking for and I ordered several. I received different colors so I could tell them apart too!  Just what I needed! Thanks!</li>
    <li> it would be very nice if all part locked so you would not lose your pills</li>
    <li> This 7-day contour pill reminder size large is perfect for what I needed. It&#x27;s the right size for the job and keeps the pills in their place until I&#x27;m ready for them.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000B90J38 7 Day Pill Reminder -3 Xl - Size 11 Inches L X 2 3/8 Inches W X 1 1/4 Inches Deep]]&lt;br /&gt;Usually, we buy several types of medicine for four weeks, by presiciption, from the drug store at once.  Then, I put evey pills into four cases immeidately after I get home.  Take pills from one section in every morning and forget about the trouble checking the pills rest of the days for four weeks.  I hope all drug stores in this country may give away the case by point saving systems or so.</li>
    <li> Pretty straight-forward.  I&#x27;m not skipping through a field singing love songs about the thing, but it holds the pills and doesn&#x27;t have any annoying lock mechanism for me to pry out of it.  The only complaint is that it really shouldn&#x27;t be considered \\&quot;large;\\&quot; I have to restock it twice a day because it doesn&#x27;t hold all my doses.</li>
    <li> I was thinking it was at least medium&lt;br /&gt;it is very small - holds may 4 vitamins&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my evening pills - works good</li>
    <li> Just too small for my pills and vitamins. I donated it to charity, unused, for those with one or two pills --  little ones!!!</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do, lids seem durable unlike other products where the lids tend to fail quickly.</li>
    <li> It is really good. Strong, practical and durable. I did quite a lot of research to find this but I think I chose the right one.</li>
    <li> Happy with this product</li>
    <li> Very little to say about this. I is exactly what i thought it was. i think we&#x27;ve all seen one so ill skip the description. this one is sturdy and will last a long time the price was competitive. There is a million of these in the world i dont know if this one is really better than another? I gave it 5 stars because it is exactly what i wanted/thought it was and the price was fair.</li>
    <li> For those of us that have to take multiple pills on a daily basis. Nice size yet small enough to take with you if need be.</li>
    <li> I wanted a second pill box the same size as one I already had, and this was just the size I wanted.  My complaint about new one I just received is that the lip you pull up on to open each section is just too small, making it very hard to open.</li>
    <li> I have three &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; sized pills to take each day and this works perfectly.  I can easily get my fingers in there to retrieve them and the lids are easy to open without popping open on their own.  Each compartment will easily hold six extra-strength Tylenol.</li>
    <li> After looking at local big-box stores and even pharmacies, I couldn&#x27;t find a &amp;#34;one-a-day&amp;#34; weekly pill container that wasn&#x27;t all rounded and/or comes in trendy colors.</li>
    <li> Perfect for organizing my daily meds and supplements. My 1000mg krill oil capsules are very large but fit. However more than one or two large pills may be all it can handle. Smalls pills are no problem.</li>
    <li> It fits what I need.  I might need to find smaller medicine to fit all of my supplements.&lt;br /&gt;Other wise it is good.</li>
    <li> If I remember.  this was presented as a Large pill dispenser.  It is Not.  It is small.  Maybe a five vitamin size.  Disappointed</li>
    <li> The size as shown when I ordered the pill boxes were not what I received. The ones I got were smaller and so of no use to me so I returned them. Happily, I was in a Walmart the other day and stumbled upon some boxes that fit the bill perfectly (and were significantly cheaper, to boot)</li>
    <li> Works fine, decent quality. Size is not what I would consider large. Picture makes it look much larger than it actually is.</li>
    <li> I love this little pill organizer!  I am very blessed that all I need to take everyday is my calcium, but I could never remember if I took it or not.  With this little tool, I can see at a glance if I did or not and take care of it.  It neatly holds 5 tums all in a roll making it very handy in deed.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I take vitamins and other medication each day. These containers, while nice, are too small for more than 3 pills. They should state travel or purse size, not large as this was misleading.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t as large as I&#x27;d hoped it would be but it holds all I need it to hold each week for my dog&#x27;s medications.</li>
    <li> Good product. It holds pills just what I need it to do.  Sorry I have to use so many characters in order for this to work.</li>
    <li> This was just what I wanted at a good price!  I take 5 pills per day and they fit nicely in the compartments!</li>
    <li> This box is hard to open, and I have rather strong fingers. But it is designed for medical use, so many of it users are sick and/or old people, who are physically weak.  A pill reminder which requires physical strength is an absurd.</li>
    <li> I purchased these pill boxes for my father.  He needed them to be a specific size, big enough for his vitamins and medicines and they were just right.  He was happy they arrived so quickly and I am too as he is not the most patient person and he&#x27;d be calling at least once a day until they were in his hands.  :)  We&#x27;re both very happy!</li>
    <li> Very durable. It&#x27;s compact, yet I can fit 6+ medium sized pills in for each day. It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> Disappointed .... this is the same quality box you can buy in Walgreen&#x27;s for 99 cents ... I wanted something better than that but this is the same cheap box,</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s big enough to hold one large multivitamin and three smaller pills so I like that, but I find the lids difficult to open.  It seems to be getting a little easier over time, but I wonder how long the case will last.</li>
    <li> This case replaced my old one, on which the lettering had rubbed away.  I wish I&#x27;d gotten this one sooner!  The individual holders are large and roomy, the letters are easy to read, and the compartments open easily and seal tightly.  The container as a whole, however, is not ridiculously big.  The blue color makes it easy to spot.  Well done.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed but I kept forgetting to buy one whenever I went to the store. This is very simple and appears to be well made. Thank you, fast shipping also!</li>
    <li> I was too lazy to go to dollar store which I should&#x27;ve gone to. This is not worth the money seriously. The day print started to pill soon and now it looks dirty :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really happy with this product. It arrived quickly and in good condition. I use it for vitamins and supplements which tend to be larger pills. It fits four or five larger vitamins and a few smaller ones. It&#x27;s perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> The product works well, but the term &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; is an understatement.  I could barely fit 4 medium sized pills per day.</li>
    <li> I have been very satisfied with these pill holders.  I bought four of these holders to hold a month&#x27;s worth of pills.  Once a month, when the four are empty, I fill them all with a selection of all of the pills I take each morning.</li>
