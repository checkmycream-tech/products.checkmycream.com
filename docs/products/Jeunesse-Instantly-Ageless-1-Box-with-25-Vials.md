      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I use mine on top of my makeup.</li>
      <li>Not a product you can put anything on top of.  </li>
      <li>Once you get used to it, it&#x27;s pretty amazing!  </li>
      <li>But for the most part, I will never be without it.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Love it -</li>
      <li>helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles</li>
      <li>it cracks and turns lightly brown.</li>
      <li>Great product that actually works!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really surprised how good it worked.</li>
      <li>Have still not been able to get it right.  </li>
      <li>I use it sparingly and for special occasions.</li>
      <li>cool stuff</li>
      <li>Works really fast, excellents results, love it</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really say any more than that</li>
      <li>So for so good seems to be a little powdery after you apply, but I love the out come.</li>
      <li>I realize its a quick fix, but I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
      <li>and I will use this supplier ..because it worked great thanks,  Blank Slate!!!!!</li>
      <li>i am sure minor areas of wrinkles will be better for this product.</li>
      <li>worth a try though.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Would be much better if the vials were more accessible to hands that are not always able to squeeze hard enough to get the full amount from its contents.</li>
      <li>It worked exactly as advertised and I am back to order more.</li>
      <li>Watched the video first.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you order the vials, the product is packed in such a way that you can cover them after using whatever amount you choose, and the product maintains its moisture.</li>
      <li>I followed it EXACTLY what I saw in you</li>
      <li>I lost my first order</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>fast service</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
      <li>I still get very fascinated every time I watch it on you</li>
      <li>well, if that&#x27;s the case, you are using too much.</li>
      <li>Works very well under my makeup.</li>
      <li>Do not need a lot and really get rid of the bags under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>It had a tint to it and also made my undereyes look very wrinkled after an hour or so..</li>
      <li>very tiny amounts in a foil filled &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; type of pack.  </li>
      <li>Only thing you might have to be aware of is if you are in hot, humid weather for an extended period of time, your sweat may dissolve the product.</li>
      <li>Even applying just a little, the look is better than natural, but makes my skin feel like paper Mache.</li>
      <li>Love this product, ever have those bags under your eyes, this product will reduce those bags to nothing in a few short minutes, just love it, tried a sample and fell in love with them,  had a little trouble with shipping</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m old!</li>
      <li>You have to use moisturizer first because if you put it on non moisturized skin it turns white and scaly.</li>
      <li>Would not waste money on it again..</li>
      <li>Maybe on young skin like demonstrator.  </li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, and if you make sure you put it</li>
      <li>This stuff is crazy amazing!</li>
      <li>Then later on after it drys completely</li>
      <li>Bought this for dark circles and bags under my eyes, it really does work!</li>
      <li>it does the job but not very long.  </li>

<li> Then later on after it drys completely</li>
<li> Bought this for dark circles and bags under my eyes, it really does work!</li>
<li> it does the job but not very long.  </li>
<li> It leaves film underneath my eyes where my eye bags are and it looks and feels like dry egg white.</li>
<li> It does work but only for a short time like less then two hours if that.</li>
<li> I applied it on several areas on my face and neck, but only had slight tightening under my eyes.</li>
<li> The packets dry up, and you lose the majority of the product.</li>
<li> not as expected or as advertized</li>
<li> but it only lasts for a few minutes.</li>
<li> It works (albeit until you take it off), plain and simple.</li>
<li> Not sure whether I applied this correctly, but followed the instructions and was left with a chalky film over the area I applied.  </li>
<li> The bags go away until you sweat and a dark burned look of the skin replaces the bag</li>
<li> Not just for women I purchased a sample and was amazed at how it took away my dark circles and bags under my eyes.  </li>
<li> but I think less of it.</li>
<li> If you watch the online tutorials from people using the product, they specify using approx half a pea size.</li>
<li> Half of the tubes were dried up</li>
<li> you will not get the little bottles pictured.</li>
<li> A little bit on the end of a finger smoothed around the under eye area and skin is tightened in minutes.</li>
<li> not good for eyebrow frowning because we make expressions all day long</li>
<li> It is too costly to use everyday.</li>
<li> but I did get a chance to try applying it a few times and it didn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
<li> when it dries, your face feels heavy.</li>
<li> This product is a waste of money.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a very good product it works miracles I love it. It took ten years off of my eyes no bags under my eyes at all when I use it.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! It had a tint to it and also made my undereyes look very wrinkled after an hour or so..</li>
    <li> I find product really good.</li>
    <li> Bought this for dark circles and bags under my eyes, it really does work!</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend this product. Excellent results.</li>
    <li> you will not get the little bottles pictured. you will rcv. very tiny amounts in a foil filled &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; type of pack.  product works for fluid reduction under the eye for a very short time.  The product is over 90% water and 10%  trace minerals....TEMPORARY!</li>
    <li> I applied it on several areas on my face and neck, but only had slight tightening under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Save ur money for plastic surgery.  This product is a waste of money.  I used one tube with no results following the instructions.  I threw the entire box in the trash. Shame on that company for false advertising!</li>
    <li> 4.5. Watched the video first.  Works like a charm. I use it sparingly and for special occasions. Works very well under my makeup.</li>
    <li> I did not see the results I was expecting and product was too expensive.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! Always heard about this stuff and was skeptical, but it&#x27;s truly Botox in a tube once you get the hang of how to property apply it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fact that u can&#x27;t use makeup wth this product</li>
    <li> I love this product. It performed  up to its claims. A little bit on the end of a finger smoothed around the under eye area and skin is tightened in minutes. Only thing you might have to be aware of is if you are in hot, humid weather for an extended period of time, your sweat may dissolve the product. But for the most part, I will never be without it. It&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ve already re-ordered it and will continue to do so. I also recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> It works just it was advertised</li>
    <li> saw a commercial on TV for it and it seemed to work wonders. tried it at home at I don&#x27;t see the same results...</li>
    <li> 5 stars!!! love it !!! I&#x27;m really surprised how good it worked. I also used my powder on my face not liquid and it looked great!!!!! and I will use this supplier ..because it worked great thanks,  Blank Slate!!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Will be sure to always keep some on hand!</li>
    <li> The product does work as advertised</li>
    <li> Love it - Do not need a lot and really get rid of the bags under my eyes.  I have used powder make-up over it and have used a non oil based makeup under it without any issues.  It lasts a good 8 hours.  Will not leave home without it anymore.  Worth the money.  I just use it under my eyes to get rid of the bags and the one vial lasts me 4-5 days.</li>
    <li> Love the product but dislike the packaging. Would be much better if the vials were more accessible to hands that are not always able to squeeze hard enough to get the full amount from its contents.</li>
    <li> It does work but only for a short time like less then two hours if that. You have to use moisturizer first because if you put it on non moisturized skin it turns white and scaly. You can use it on the edge of your lips for lip line wrinkles but you have to use moisturizer as it turns white. It is too costly to use everyday. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again because of the short length of time it works.  But it does work.</li>
    <li> helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles</li>
    <li> Love it! Works like advertised</li>
    <li> this works well for me.  I have a friend that says it did not help her, but it does work on me!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I need to get permission to return.  I can&#x27;t keep the product from caking &amp; flaking.  doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> Thus product does not work if you use a foundation over it.. Would not waste money on it again.. Wish I could get a reimbursement..</li>
    <li> Great great product. Once you learn how to apply its simple. I use mine on top of my makeup. Not under. Love this product. It doesn&#x27;t take much. 1tube lasts for several uses.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised! Can&#x27;t really say any more than that</li>
    <li> I LOVED this product!!! It worked exactly as advertised and I am back to order more. A little goes a long way, and if you make sure you put it • on top • of your makeup, it works perfectly. You can watch it working. It&#x27;s like anti-aging magic-in-a-tube!</li>
    <li> this almost feels like glue. when it dries, your face feels heavy. it does the job but not very long.  not good for eyebrow frowning because we make expressions all day long so it doesn&#x27;t last.  i am sure minor areas of wrinkles will be better for this product. worth a try though. cool stuff</li>
    <li> Once you get used to it, it&#x27;s pretty amazing!  And I&#x27;m old! 70!!!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the tube as advertised.  I received the non reclosable packets which I did not want.&lt;br /&gt;The product works well alone but when used with makeup it looks crusty.</li>
    <li> This does not work. Maybe on young skin like demonstrator.  I am sending back for refund</li>
    <li> Some days I can get this to work other days not so much hard to apply on forehead wrinkles</li>
    <li> This works, but not how I would like it to.  It just takes away about 1/2 of what I need done.  A tad disapointed.</li>
    <li> Takes some time to get used to - but effective.</li>
    <li> I lost my first order but I did get a chance to try applying it a few times and it didn&#x27;t work for me... I still get very fascinated every time I watch it on you tube so I decided to give it another try and again it&#x27;s not working for me. It leaves film underneath my eyes where my eye bags are and it looks and feels like dry egg white. Then later on after it drys completely it cracks and turns lightly brown. I followed it EXACTLY what I saw in you tube and still not working.</li>
    <li> Not a product you can put anything on top of.  So if you plan on wearing make up, forget it.  It is like putting a mask on your face, it shrinks your bags/wrinkles etc...but it is temp.  Once you add any kind of moisture or product to your face it eliminates this and the bags/wrinkles are back.  Waste of money....don&#x27;t waste your hare earned money on this!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.......because it works!</li>
    <li> Wonderful!! Works really fast, excellents results, love it</li>
    <li> Just another topical gimmick. You can feel it tightening around the eye area but it only lasts for a few minutes. Save your money!</li>
    <li> My wife is amazed at how well it works.  I will sue the living hell out of the manufacturer if she has any complications or hazardous side effects from using this product.</li>
    <li> just what I had hoped. fast service</li>
    <li> Have still not been able to get it right.  Even applying just a little, the look is better than natural, but makes my skin feel like paper Mache.</li>
    <li> not as expected or as advertized</li>
    <li> Half of the tubes were dried up and I couldn&#x27;t use them</li>
    <li> Love this product, ever have those bags under your eyes, this product will reduce those bags to nothing in a few short minutes, just love it, tried a sample and fell in love with them,  had a little trouble with shipping but my replacement came as scheduled.  Love, Love this product!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  Just like the lady showed on facebook!  Very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> The bags go away until you sweat and a dark burned look of the skin replaces the bag</li>
    <li> Great product that actually works! I love it! Prompt delivery as well!</li>
    <li> I still believe this is a fve star product, however, my shipment was sachets instead of the vials that I ordered. Same product, but I think less of it. Still a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Not sure whether I applied this correctly, but followed the instructions and was left with a chalky film over the area I applied.  Hefty price and not sure whether I&#x27;ll finish the box now.</li>
    <li> This stuff is crazy amazing! I see complaints about the tightness and powdery look...well, if that&#x27;s the case, you are using too much. If you watch the online tutorials from people using the product, they specify using approx half a pea size. It works (albeit until you take it off), plain and simple.</li>
    <li> This product works great.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with Instantly Ageless. It greatly improves under eye puffiness which is exactly what I was looking for. I would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with the results it has provided me. It might be for everyone but it does take the bags under my eyes for at least 7 hours.</li>
    <li> Not just for women I purchased a sample and was amazed at how it took away my dark circles and bags under my eyes.  I have already re-ordered the product.</li>
    <li> The product definitely works however it can&#x27;t be worn beneath any type of makeup whatsoever. I have found that it works best for me if i leave it on overnight, and then just rinse it off in the morning. It truly  works at reducing puffiness beneath my eyes. I have really bad allergies, and this has been the only product that helps with that issue. I realize its a quick fix, but I&#x27;ll take it.Make sure you order the vials, the product is packed in such a way that you can cover them after using whatever amount you choose, and the product maintains its moisture. The packets dry up, and you lose the majority of the product.</li>
    <li> So for so good seems to be a little powdery after you apply, but I love the out come.</li>
    <li> This simply does NOT work!!!</li>
