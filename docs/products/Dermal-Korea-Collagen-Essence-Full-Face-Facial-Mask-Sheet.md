<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very useful and gentle for my skin!</li>
    <li> I use one of these once a week and it really helps my skin stay hydrated. I&#x27;d recommend this pack for anyone who is trying them out for the first time. You get so many different ones that you wont know what to try first but they all seem pretty good to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used these before. I&#x27;ve only used the aloe one so far but it was a fantastic experience. My skin felt amazing. My face was itchy and peeling from my DMAE moisturizer and AHA skin cleanser. I needed something to soothe it. I picked the perfect one... the aloe was so cooling and calming. I can&#x27;t wait to try the rest. BTW, you&#x27;ll look a little freaky with this mask on, but you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
    <li> I discovered the masks after purchasing an asian facial massager that referred to a mask treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these once a week.  It&#x27;s  an assortment of masks for everything to firming to moisturizing and have given some to friends to try.</li>
    <li> The masks cannot attach to the face perfectly......</li>
    <li> I am in looooveeee with these. They are an inexpensive mask that I can use every other day as an indulgence in my skin care routine. My skin is of the combination type and moisturizing it is a must. When I let my skin get dry, certain areas tend to overproduce oil and others become dry and flaky. These masks help me deeply moisturize my skin and when put on chilled greatly help soothe my skin. I really recommend that you try this! It feels so nice and helps keep skin supple too. The product, of course, came as depicted and the combo pack allows me to try different masks types.... FYI I don&#x27;t mind that they are all different. Great price for these and I don&#x27;t see why you wouldn&#x27;t try them :] love korean face masks!</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT BUT IT HAS ALOT OF EXCESS BUILT INTO IT</li>
    <li> Love the mask, easy to use, leaves my face feeling soft&amp; moisturized.</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive, good quality masks. There&#x27;s a few masks I&#x27;m hesitant to try, like the snake or snail, but I am still excited to use them. I will repurchase. Also shipment was on track.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying face masks and they really make your face feel soft and refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really understand why some people are saying they didn&#x27;t receive the entire variety. I was a bit anxious after reading those reviews because I thought I was only going to get duplicates and etc...but maybe it has changed since then? Either way, I guess I was lucky enough to received the entire set shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> Really good masks,but my skin doesn&#x27;t look different after using it</li>
    <li> Really fantastic product, makes my skin feel great!  Hydrates really well and provides vitamins for a healthy glow that lasts a full day.  Excellent product, love it!</li>
    <li> buy this monthly use every other day!</li>
    <li> The best masks I have used. I would recommend for everyone.</li>
    <li> I like these face masks very well. They add a bit of moisture when I need it. I&#x27;ve been using these face masks weekly for a month, now, and my skin feels more moisturized than it used to before I started using face masks. These masks are a great deal. My only complaint with them currently is the smell. Each one I&#x27;ve used so far has a light fragrance that makes my skin burn slightly. I have had no problems with rashes or anything, but the smell on the herbal masks can be a bit troublesome.</li>
    <li> better than Japanese mask. make my skin looks hydrate and white</li>
    <li> Bought for the wife. Her review: &amp;#34;Admittedly, I was a bit skeptical of these. But I actually love these! They are kinda weird at first but they make my skin feel good. Would purchase again.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Fun to try different versions.  Great price.  Some I like better than others, but eventually I&#x27;ll buy a ten pack of the one I like best.  Refreshing, mild and much easier to rinse off than the clay masks.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, combination skin that is prone to acne. I love masks and mask sheets, but some other brands have worsened my skin with use instead of improved it. Although each of the mask sheets in this bundle are different, none of them aggravated or worsened my skin! The aloe mask soothed the best and snail mask made my skin look overall better. The skin on my face has better tone and elasticity. Plus, the combo really helps you figure out which masks benefit your skin the most.</li>
    <li> These are the same brand as the ones for sale at our local Korean Spa/Bathhouse -- just much cheaper. Each facial leaves you with noticeably nicer skin for about 3 days. Would order again.</li>
    <li> Skin: Combination-Oily, Hormonal Acne, Acne Scarring, Redness, Sun Sensitive. (FYI, oily skin can be dry/flaky and still requires moisturizing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need quantity, this is it for less then a dollar a piece. Though there are cheaper ones out there, these are great for the price. There is a slight fragrance, but it wasn&#x27;t overpowering like Vanedo masks can be. However, if you are extremely sensitive to fragrance, consider another mask. These masks have their intended benefits listed on the front of each packet, which I didn&#x27;t notice do anything different to my skin. You may have to use the same type(aloe, pearl, snail, etc) of mask continuously to notice the difference, if any, but I haven&#x27;t come across this brand selling multiples of the same type for me to try. For this particular variety pack, I focused more on its moisturizing abilities and lack of irritation to my skin. It is definitely moisturizing to a point that I didn&#x27;t need a cream over it once I was done. No irritation and no break out for me. It feels great on the skin and the masks are generously coated in serum with no excess serum sitting in the packets. The mask sizing was generic, able to fit most faces. Overall, these masks are simple and great to just throw on after facial cleansing. Tip: Refrigerate your masks(any brand) for a nice cooling sensation.</li>
    <li> loved it! fast shipping. moist faceness.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like every packet but over all its a good value</li>
    <li> keeps skin hydrated and smooth for about 4 days.</li>
    <li> I ordered these from BB Cosmetic. I actually received 17 masks instead of 16, so no complaints here. I did receive one duplicate of the Green Tea mask (I didn&#x27;t receive the Marine Mask) but also received a Collagen mask which wasn&#x27;t pictured, so again no complaints. The essence is more gel like unlike the masks I&#x27;ve purchased before here in the States, which seems to be more watery. The masks also seem to fit better on my face than the ones I&#x27;ve bought before. Definitely would purchase again if available from the same retailer.</li>
    <li> Omg I wish I could give these more stars. Sjupping was incredible. I love the variation.  I use them 3-4 times a week. If you keep them in the fridge they feel 10 times better.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased / used these face / facial masks and love them!  Wash face - unfold carefully and apply to face - smoothing over every part.  Sit back relax - read - watch tv - work on the computer etc for 15 minutes to a half hour and remove.  I then take the mask and gently go over my entire face, neck &amp; back of my hands and just let it dry.  I apply a moisturizer over it and leave it on overnight.  I actually feel as tho I&#x27;ve gone to a salon and had a facial.  HIGHLY recommend</li>
    <li> Quite frankly, I was blown away by these masks. I had tried Celkin sheet masks that I picked up in TJ Maxx and they were terrible. After that I was skeptical of sheet masks and if they actually did anything. But after putting one of these on and rubbing in the excess product, my skin was amazing! It was soft, hydrated, and bright. The price is a bonus as well. So if you haven&#x27;t tried any sheet masks, definitely spend the money on these!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using these masks. You get a wide variety, and the price is great. I haven&#x27;t had any irritation from using these.</li>
    <li> My husband got me some for Christmas and I love them. I don&#x27;t know if they work but they are refreshing and really nice they sheet is thick and it super easy to clean up. Not at all time consuming, they smell great and work well on my sensitive skin. I am going to buy them again.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but on the bottom of each masks it says 141211.. December 11, 2014... Was that the exoneration date?! If it is I am very mad!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin. But these products do not irritate my skin at all. Very soothing and moisturizing! love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality for a reasonable price. The only reason for four stars is because they don&#x27;t fit my face very well.</li>
    <li> super hydrating and so many to choose from! don&#x27;t know if it really works since there are so many things the masks target, but it&#x27;s a must-have for those pampering nights :)</li>
    <li> Get it. Like seriously. Fast shipping. Amazing products. Especially if you got a cold or flu.</li>
    <li> Nice and cool give u a good feeling</li>
    <li> These beauty face masks are high-quality and affordable.</li>
    <li> Got this for niece&#x27;s spa bday party. There were some interesting ones like &amp;#34;snail&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;snake&amp;#34; so the girls got a kick out of those.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with several brands of face masks (Face Shop, My Beauty Diary, Nature Republic etc.) and this one is probably my least favorite. All of the different types are thick, some of them feel slimy versus refreshing, and the cut of the face mask doesn&#x27;t fit quite right. I used to use face masks regularly (1 per week) but now use is determined by when I have time/want to feel rejuvenated. My routine is face wash, toner, mask (pat in after done), face cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Pretty moisturizing and refreshing as face masks especially after refrigerating, can leave them on for 20 minutes - 30 minutes before drying out, have eye covers if you want to give your eyes that extra boost as well, simple packaging for travel, light scent, inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Can&#x27;t really tell the difference between the different varieties (a lot of them feel similar), the mask itself is thick - I prefer thinner ones, cut doesn&#x27;t quite fit but that could be a result of the thickness (the nose tip area), don&#x27;t notice an actual difference after using them (more mental relaxation), some of them are too slimy to be refreshing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, compared with other brands, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again because there are other similarly priced masks that work better. My favorite mask types from this set are the Aloe and Cucumber because the serum feels light and cools your face.</li>
    <li> Enjoyed using these and received a great variety of options. At the minimum, they are refreshing.</li>
    <li> These are great and leave my skin super hydrated - definitely a great for a pick-me-up for dry skin.  I like to use after a deep exfoliation because it leaves my skin glowing.  Make sure to clean skin very well before use as to not have any trace of make up on (I&#x27;d recommend to use a toner after cleansing).  I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend for oily skin or acne prone skin.  Less one star because the fragrance of most the masks isn&#x27;t wonderful, but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
    <li> It does not work for me. I feel bad</li>
    <li> I loved these so much I had my friends order them after they complimented on how great my skin has been looking.  I use it 1-2 times a week.  I like to use my Olay cleansing brush and then lay down for 15-20 minutes with a mask on my face.  My skin feels so nice and smooth afterwards.  I really like how they feel.  After smoothing it on my face I take the extra liquid and put it on my chest/neck area and the back of my hands.  The directions say you don&#x27;t have to rinse after removal but I take a slightly damp towel to remove the excess liquid or else it can feel a little sticky.  I will definitely continue to buy these.  They do look a little funny on, like a cross between a ghost and the KKK.  Unfortunately I scared my daughter wearing one and made her cry.  But they are fun, feel great on your skin, and worth the very little $$ they cost.</li>
    <li> They are useful for me.I like them.</li>
    <li> It is a good product. I bought over 100 because of the easiness of use compared to lotion or cream. However, it does not absorb to the skin as well as lotion or cream. Also, it has a variety of different ingredients, but you cannot feel the difference between them. You can buy just one type or mixed ones.</li>
    <li> Great deal! Good variety of masks that leave your face soft and feeling refershed.</li>
    <li> All the different varieties came in mine and it was shipped promptly.  They are not mud masks, but rather moist toilette masks with whatever ingredients listed on the package.  I love them, and I enjoy using them.  They are very gentle on my sensitive skin, although I cannot say that I have noticed a vast improvement.  But it&#x27;s only been a couple weeks, so I am going to continue to try them all.</li>
    <li> I love sheet masks a lot but they tend to be fairly expensive, coming in at around $5 for one and you&#x27;re never quite sure if you&#x27;ll like it or not.  That&#x27;s why I really love this, it&#x27;s pretty cheap for the amount of masks you&#x27;re getting plus it comes with a large variety of masks so you can try a bunch.  While the masks are not incredibly impressive or dramatically changed my skin, they were nice and were a really good starting point for me to get into sheet masks.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved these masks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who don&#x27;t know, a face mask is typically an oval shaped piece of close with holes for your eyes, nose, and mouth. This cotton is soak in a liquid, essence. You place the mask on your face for roughly 20 minutes for hydration purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use one of these almost every night. Not only is this pack cost effective it also allows you to use a variety of different ingredients, some of which I hadn&#x27;t even known about. My favorite aspect of these masks is that the eye holes aren&#x27;t just cut out. Instead they partial cut the eye holes and left a flap there. This might seem bad but it can serve two different purposes: you can let it fold over to give your under eyes extra moisture and to address puffiness OR you can lay down, close your eyes, and fold the flaps over your eyes to address your eye lids. The masks isn&#x27;t dripping with essence by the time you put it on so it doesn&#x27;t hurt your eyes at all. I haven&#x27;t seen another masks with this ability; it is perfect for relaxing and taking a small moment for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the aftermath, I am acne prone and these didn&#x27;t break me out at all. Another added bonus is that they don&#x27;t have alcohol like most other masks so they are hydrating even after you take the mask off.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s good,but I never try it before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving my face lately because of my packs</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT, AS IT BLEACHES YOUR SKIN UNEVENLY, RESULTING IN HYPOPIGMENTATION!!! I HAD PERFECT SKIN PRIOR TO USING THIS PRODUCT. I HAVE USED JAPANESE SHEET MASKS FOR YEARS AND WHEN I SAW THIS KOREAN VERSION FOR A CHEAPER PRICE I FIGURED ID TRY IT. MY MOTHER USED ONE AND IMMEDIATELY SAW A HUGE WHITE SPOT NEXT TO HER MOUTH. I USED IT SEVERAL TIMES AND DIDNT NOTICE ANYTHING UNTIL ONE DAY WHEN I SAW THAT I TOO HAD ALL OF THESE BLEACHED WHITE SPOTS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT MY FACE. THIS IS A DANGEROUS PRODUCT. THIS IS IRREVERSIBLE AND DEVASTATING. I PLAN TO PURSUE THIS FURTHER AS THIS HAS DESTROYED MY FACE.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE STAY AWAY AS THERES NO TELLING WHATS TRULY IN THIS PRODUCT TO MAKE IT SO STRONG. DEVASTATING!!!!!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re expecting 16 different sheets, I&#x27;m sorry to tell you that you will be disappointed.  Like other people have reported, I received duplicates as well.  It&#x27;s odd because it comes in a prepackaged sealed grey bubble envelope.  I kinda find it disappointing because you should get exactly what is advertised.  I received 2 platinum and 2 Hyaluronate and did not receive Marine and White.  The only thing that makes it kinda okay is that instead of 16 sheets, they gave me 17.  Overall, there is nothing special about these sheets.  I used the Hyaluronate and the sheet is comfortable, fits my face well.  The serum is okay.  Nothing special.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t give you a lot of excess liquids like Etude house or Face Shop.  Overall, I don&#x27;t plan to repurchase.  I think Etudehouse is a better value, because I can get 2 uses out of those simply by throwing in clean face sheet (they sell them on Amazon) and get another use out of it.  I prefer their serums more, they are more refreshing and hydrating.</li>
    <li> Super soothing on your face and it feels very refreshed and moisturized afterwards. I put mine on before bed and I woke up feeling great!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality! It has made my mom&#x27;s skin look better (she&#x27;s 65) and mine as well (age 28).</li>
    <li> I am happy I wear my face mask I am so beauty thank you</li>
    <li> Amazing deal for the amount you get! Amazing product as well! After a couple uses I have noticed my blemishes disappearing. Just over my face feels better and looks better.</li>
    <li> This is just one of those feel good, do it for yourself products that I have now purchased 3 times and split the packages with my daughters.  I am not sure any of the masks do anything different than the one before but I can say that these feel heavenly when used on a hot summer day.  My daughter in AZ puts them in the fridge before using them and with summer here in PA/DE, we are doing the same - these feel terrific.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of when you use them, the do leave your face feeling smooth/soft.&lt;br /&gt;Our skin is all different, my mature skin and my youngest daughters more acne prone skin are the more extreme and none of the 4 of us have experienced any adverse reactions to any of the masks.  We are all big fans of this product and I&#x27;m really happy with the price, we all get a little pampering without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> Recieved many different ones :)</li>
    <li> i adore these masks, my skin always feels completely smooth, soft and is noticeably brighter. I love the variety pack, some are great for soothing others have a nice tightening feel and others are perfect for the morning with their cooling compounds. all are very gentle which is a huge bonus, I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve never had a problem!</li>
    <li> I buy these for the wife occasionally, and she really likes them. She claims that her face is softer and smoother; doesn&#x27;t seem to be any softer or smoother to me than before she used them. Watch out for the red ginseng one: smells terrible!</li>
    <li> Purchased from &amp;#34;Beautyspace&amp;#34; through Amazon Prime.  Arrived quickly, well packaged, good value. Understand it was a combo pack (hence very good price) but did not receive exact items in the product description as expected. Instead got only 5 of the ones listed, several duplicates, and some others as substitutes (all Dermal brand). I really wanted to try Snail, Seaweed, Red Ginseng, Q10, Pearl, Green Tea, Pomegranate, Cucumber, Apricot and Aloe :(</li>
    <li> My face was like silk after the 1st use, but after the 2nd, 3rd, ..., use, it just felt good, nothing miracle. I think that&#x27;s enough. Mask is easy to lay out and put on my face. Enough serum for my face to absorb.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in my skin from using these but they&#x27;re very nice to use after a long day or coming back from the pool where chlorine dries out the skin.</li>
    <li> For the most part they are good. Nothing over the top. They play well into the at home spa night ordeal. I do have sensitive skin and some of them make my skin itchy.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing these. This purchase is really about the perfect quantity, quality and price. I&#x27;ve used several brands of face masks, including the Body Shop, Nivea, Garnier, My Beauty Diary etc. This ranks near Body Shop at a slightly lower price. Each mask peels off from plastic and is easy to use, soothing and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the masks have a nice scent, but they do lay on a little wet at the start, they seem saturated with the solution and do feel like you have condensed milk on you face. As it dries, it starts to feel more rejuvenating, but if the initial wetness grosses you out, then these probably aren&#x27;t for you. I don&#x27;t mind the excess moisture as much because I have a shower right after and I like to sit in front of a fan and have it dry faster. A fan really helps make this mask refreshing and soothing (I think there is a little methanol in this, it reminds me of a milder version of when you drink water while chewing gum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a dead sea mud mask as part of my weekly routine and need a decent moisturizing mask for after or my skin dries out too much, this suits that purpose very well. This is like a nice spa day, fun and refreshing, but don&#x27;t expect it to do much for you skin except hydrate and perhaps smooth if the rest of your skin care regiment is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that excess use, more than twice a week can result in oily skin with combination skin types (like mine) and can even lead to a mild acne break out. Also, if you wear glasses, you might have to lay the nose hole several times to get it right and squeeze down the the edges above your nose, or your glasses will be fogging up the hole time (in case you are doing other stuff at the same time). If you are looking for an affordable addition of moisture or soothing for you skin, this will work well.</li>
    <li> This product is okay, not the thick serum I expected but still leaves the skin nice and moist. I recommend keeping them in the fridge especially if you steam your face first the cold on your face is an amazing feel.</li>
    <li> Love it! makes my face feel rejuvenated. Helps to keep my skin glowing each morning after a long day at work the day before and having very little sleep.</li>
    <li> These masks are so refreshing and moisturizing! As soon as my pack is done I think I&#x27;ll be buying another :)</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this. I love all the sheet mask ! (: makes my face very moisturize and soft &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I rate it an eight (8) since I have not had successful results from it.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it every night since I received it and do not see a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am a senior over 75 years of age and feel there Is nothing that can help my&lt;br /&gt;skin at this age.</li>
    <li> I purchased these from Beautyspace through Amazon Prime, and at $1.04 each, this is a steal! I received one of each of the following: Arbutin, Cherry blossoms, Royal Jelly, Bee Venom, Snail, Vegetable Placenta, Apricot, Natto, Collagen, Wine, Green Tea, Strawberry, Bamboo, Platinum, Herb, and Pomegranate.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE VERY HYDRATING MASK I HAVE LOVED EVERYONE IVE TRIED SO FAR!!!!!!!! I HAVE USED FIVE OF THEM AND MY SKIN IS GLOWING AFTERWARDS</li>
    <li> These feel amazing after putting them in the fridge....use after a shower for a spa treatment at home.  I don&#x27;t think they go further than to offer instant moisture for a short period of time. For the price you pay, they are well worth it.  Great for a girls slumber party or a &#x27;big girls night out&#x27; with some wine and cheese.......I have ordered three sets so far.</li>
    <li> I love these facial masks. They&#x27;re a great little indulgence and in inexpensive way to pamper myself. They&#x27;re cooling and moisturizing. I like to: (1) cleanse my face and remove any makeup, then (2) exfoliate with a sugar and olive oil scrub or Clarisonic, and (3) apply a facial mask to moisturize. As the instructions state, you don&#x27;t need to wash it off when you&#x27;re done. Just massage the extra serum into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the perennial words of Donna from Parks &amp; Recreation, treat yo&#x27;self!</li>
    <li> each facial sheet generously saturated,  enough left  over to apply onto neck. skin feels smother after application. i use 2x week. it&#x27;s easy to use and good price.</li>
    <li> These masks are so easy to use since all the product is on a paper template that stays on your face, just peel the template off when finished and smooth in any remaining product, no rising involved. Variety included, nice to experiment with different masks, like that the mask can cover your eye lids if you want</li>
    <li> good product. feel refreshing. good quality; use each night to hydrate face; will order more; recommend to everyone ,, .</li>
    <li> I love how nice it makes my face feel and look. I kept mine in the fridge for the extra cold boost!</li>
    <li> So nice product, I like that it came like mix and U can try different ones. Perfect for my sensitive and combination skin.</li>
    <li> All the masks are amazing, feels luxurious. Well packaged, worth the price.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE MASKS SO MUCH LIKE EACH ONE IS DIFFERENT AND GLORIUS IN IT&amp;#34;S OWS WAY. I would totally purchase this again. It hydrates the skin, brightens it, and heals fine lines. Also, you face looks plumper. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I love these masks. They are so refreshing and make your skin feel so good.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these facial masks. Quick and easy to use and my skin feels so nice and soft afterwards! Definitely would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great masks for the price. Very pleased. Getting ready to sock up again!</li>
    <li> Feels very nice to my sensitive skin. I am allergic to lots of the facial mask, but this one has a cool refresh feeling and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. Has very light scent which I like too. Not sure of all the different packages, they all feel the same.</li>
    <li> I like them although I don&#x27;t see any differences among many ingredients. It really makes a face refreshing.</li>
    <li> Not really good for me</li>
    <li> 100% happy with my purchase. These masks actually fit my face properly, are thick, and feel soo nice after a long day. I will be reviewing them on my blog too I love them so much. Am ordering another batch even though I just bought this one!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Received 2 more than the package states:) I love the variety..can&#x27;t wait to try charcoal and snail!! On a side note, these little Jason like masks are fun to scare your kids with, my 10 year old son about jumped out of his skin when I snuck up on him with the mask on! The mask is refreshing and very moist.  I kept it on for longer than recommended,  and my skin looked brighter afterwards. Can&#x27;t wait to try the others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used four of them (and yes, I got all sixteen different masks as pictured here) and I like them. They are very saturated and I find myself applying the extra to my neck and decolletage just because I hate waste. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any real change, but they&#x27;re great for when I want to relax at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I got these to try as I have had similar products, but mostly moisturizing masks. The 16 facials came loose leaf in a bubble lined mail envelope which was some what disappointing because I thought they&#x27;d come in a box.  I&#x27;m American and these facials seemed interesting (I certainly don&#x27;t see many similar things where I live). I haven&#x27;t tried all of them but so far I&#x27;m pleased. They don&#x27;t entirely fit the dimensions of my face but it&#x27;s not a huge issue.  When you open up the mask it&#x27;s wet and cool (almost a gel like feel).  During the 20 minutes on my face it feels cool and soothing. When the 20 minutes is done you just peel it off and rub in the remainder fluid (it absorbs very quickly). It is defiantly something I will consider purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I love using these types of masks, but I will not be purchasing these again.  They do not fit your face at all.  The eye holes are up to high, which means part of your forehead and tip of your nose are not covered.  The masks are supposed to be smooth on your face, but you can&#x27;t get this one smooth since it is so large.  They have not irritated my skin at all and my skin feels hydrated and soothed (especially if I used the needle roller before putting it on).  Unfortunately, the fit is so bad it makes using the mask a chore.  I know I can find a mask with a better fit.</li>
    <li> Many sheet masks for a low price.</li>
    <li> These were the first Korean sheet masks I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I have COMPLETELY fallen in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My package came with one of each of the &#x27;flavors&#x27; shown in the picture, so I get to try them all. I&#x27;m about halfway through them now, and I will DEFINITELY be repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each mask so far has been absolutely drenched in gooey luscious essence, which is a real treat. They don&#x27;t drip, but there is a lot of extra moisture left even after the 20~30 minutes on my face, so I use the rest to rub into my neck. The sheets themselves are well-built and have not ripped or torn yet. They are absolutely my favorite things in the world right now! I can&#x27;t wait to try other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what each &amp;#34;benefit&amp;#34; really does per mask - each one is labeled with three, like &amp;#34;moisturizing, convergence, brightening&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;firming, healthy, convergence&amp;#34;. Like I said, I don&#x27;t know what some of those terms mean, but I have liked them all so far.</li>
    <li> I love these they make my face so soft.  I bought a set for my sisters as well, they all love them.</li>
    <li> Good product! But, many of them are not the same sa they described.</li>
    <li> The mask essence felt nice but they just have a really odd cut out, I&#x27;ve never had a mask fit so weirdly before.  I cut them into two pieces, the top half and bottom half and it fit well after that, but annoying none-the-less.  But I guess onc thing can&#x27;t fit everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anything ne who likes sheet masks, I recommend the daiso silicone sheet mask cover.</li>
    <li> I ordered these with low-ish expectations, but I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;ve used about a third of them so far. I was not missing any of the masks upon arrival. They are mild enough to use daily, but my skin still seems to benefit from their effects the next day. I noticed my skin looks a little puffy after using, but not in a bad way, just fuller. I didn&#x27;t expect to notice differences between the masks, and mostly I haven&#x27;t, but a couple have stood out so far. The Q10 noticeable brightened my complexion and the aloe one was super hydrating through well into the next day. I&#x27;m sure I will discover more stand outs as I continue to go through the pack. Will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> My product got here very quickly. So far I have only used one of the sheet masks and I love it. It was very refreshing. It smells very nice and isn&#x27;t strong at all. You can also use the left over liquids on other parts of the body.</li>
    <li> All the masks are great! My skin is soft and smooth after doing it. LOVE ALL OF THEM! I do it 2-3 times a week. I have already bought my second order!</li>
    <li> I love these!  I tried it for the first time and some of them make an immediate impact on your skin.  Also, it&#x27;s so relaxing to lay down with one on your face for 20 minutes.  I use them twice a week and have no intention of stopping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Platinum is my favorite!</li>
    <li> After the first use my face already began to feel smoother. They are better than any moisturizer I&#x27;ve used in the past. Plus, the masks smell great! I definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. A nice variety pack. Inexpensive and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> The masks came on time and were packaged carefully so none of them leaked. The masks themselves are very nice and refreshing. I haven&#x27;t tried them all but the price is unbeatable and worth it if you are a sheet mask fan!</li>
    <li> This will be my second time ordering the masks and I love them, there&#x27;s a wide variety and inexpensive. They leave your face feeling radiant and moisturized.</li>
    <li> It is good enough. Thank you.</li>
    <li> These masks are pretty decent for their price!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not new to Asian beauty and sheet masks, there&#x27;s other products out that are better.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t really go wrong with these masks and they are perfect if you are looking for a cheaper buy, or just entering the world of sheet masks. My personal favorite was the snail, as well as the charcoal. However, I prefer masks from other sheet mask creators. I would recommend you put a little bit of more money into sheet masks since you get what you pay for with beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The expiration on these is amazing, and they are fairly effective! Collagen masks are very good for the skin and I didn&#x27;t get any agitation or clogged pores. I kept mine in the refrigerator because I like to have cool masks instead of just having them just sitting around.&lt;br /&gt;~ A good buy overall, but you want to make sure you are very careful with skincare.</li>
    <li> Slowly working through the different types.  Enjoying them so far.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Excited to buy my next patch!</li>
    <li> Lots of options and all very good quality! The front of the package tells you what each mask will do for your skin. Does NOT cause breakouts! Smells good too :)</li>
    <li> Im going to order more of this</li>
    <li> Spa  at home . I love my masks !!!</li>
    <li> Actually very good and affordable compared to other masks out there.am speaking from experience</li>
    <li> These masks are just like the ones they give you in Korean motels. Korean women have great skin and they use these masks religiously!</li>
    <li> Excellent product,live it.</li>
    <li> I reallly like the masks! I just used my first mask two days ago and I could feel a difference in my skin after my first use. Great masks! These are must have!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife.  After couple of weeks, I noticed her skin was much lighter and softer. Ordering 4 more packs today to stock and and use it for myself also LOL...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, they sell this product at Korean Markets at a higher price than you see here.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I got these babies in the mail and when I did, me and my Boyfriend got excited and we tried them out. We Really Loved Them! He tried the 24k gold sheet mask and I used the Vitamin C mask and he said his skin felt amazing and looks extremely brightened up his completion of his face and make his skin Sooo soft like a baby&#x27;s but. My face was Dewy glowing from the inside out, my face felt like it drank gallons of water and OJ if that&#x27;s possible, we loved them! I still have some and they make my face feel so firm soft and tingly but in a good cooling way!  I love how my face feels after every use!</li>
    <li> I love these masks! They are all really good and make my face feel so soft</li>
    <li> Liked these quite a bit. Hard to unfold before putting on your face but makes your skin sooooo soft.</li>
    <li> I got almost all offered, with one double (green tea) and one extra (snail). So far, I haven&#x27;t had a reaction to anything and my skin does look nice the next day. I cut off the eye flaps (they are there to cover  your eyelids if you wish) and use them on my lips instead. It is quite relaxing to kick back in bed, and watch TV until I fall asleep with one on. I&#x27;m especially happy with the price (compared to fiber masks at Sephora) and will be ordering again. I was buying them at a local Korean grocery, but they are cheaper on Amazon, so will continue to order them here.</li>
    <li> my grandma love this set, it&#x27;s a good way to hydrate your skin and keep it moisturized while watching a tv show or a book.</li>
    <li> I use to buy these from my local Korean market and they were amazing now that I&#x27;ve moved the area I&#x27;m in doesn&#x27;t have a Korean market unless I drive 1 hour to the city</li>
    <li> I love this product! It makes my face feel soft and refreshing afterwards. I use it twice a week since I&#x27;m out at the beach twice a week.</li>
    <li> So reasonably priced, you get 16 packs of facial sheet masks with enough variety to make things interesting.  So far I&#x27;ve tried only two, but very impressed the products I have used.  Smells nice, works well and again, so reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;I love these and will repurchase!&lt;br /&gt;And by the way, received these SO.FAST! Yay!</li>
    <li> Refreshes the facial skin.  Feels like a mini facial.</li>
    <li> There are better brands.  Not as moisturizing as expected.  Results are not good enough. They are not packed, they come inside a plastic bag.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like the result of these, but they fit kind of funny.</li>
    <li> As expected they are good.</li>
    <li> Great variety, have enjoyed the three I&#x27;ve used so far, and faster shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Korean brands and these did not compare. The consistency of the collagen is very watery.</li>
    <li> Helpful to refresh your skin before doing makeup or after a hard day for your skin &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> contains propylene glycol- who wants that on their face?</li>
    <li> Just received the masks, all 16 of them in wonderful shape. There&#x27;s a Korean beauty mart in my area, so I &#x27;ve tried this brand before and liked it. Please don&#x27;t compare this with the top notch brand, for $15 to $20 per mask. This is a very decent mask for everyday/ other day use - it&#x27;s less than$1 each!!!&lt;br /&gt;This mask is very similar to the sheet masks sold in Sephora, I believe they were about $5 to $6 each, so a great deal we have here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this, they are in different varieties, you can test and try the ones works the best for you,and buy the 10 packs later.(True an  tried for yourself is the best)&lt;br /&gt;I am in my late fourties, am pround that I do not have  any wrinkles (maybe some very fine hard to see under my eye). I do not have procedures done, and are 100% naturel. A lot of people thought I am in my late twenties or earlier thirties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fountain of youth is- Vitamin C skin care. some  retinol,sun screen  and lot of masks.....&lt;br /&gt;One more-I read a comment that the mask they received  expired, not true as the date on th  package is their production date.  My Korean told me that a new law for something  for the korean skin care products.</li>
    <li> This is awesome after a days work and you just want to relax - its nice and cool</li>
    <li> Received items as described. You receive one of each kind</li>
    <li> I have tried many Asian beauty products. These masks are so easy to use and leave my skin feeling amazing. I love the variety you get and the price is great.</li>
    <li> Looks like a well formulated product.  I&#x27;m going to enjoy using these on spa days.</li>
    <li> Their masks give me red bumps on my skin. I think I&#x27;m allergic.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this pack. These are fun for a little pampering before you go to bed at night. I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between any of the masks and I don&#x27;t see too much of a difference in my skin but it does feel very hydrated after use. Also you may not receive all of the different kinds of masks I got a few duplicates.</li>
    <li> I love these so much this is my third time buying them. They are easy to use, make my skin feel so soft, and only take 20-minutes. I&#x27;ll definitely keep purchasing these.</li>
    <li> They work as advertised (or at least I feel like they do). I&#x27;ve never actually heard of this brand. I love that there are various types of masks so I can try out a different one each time, although it becomes hard to figure out which ones actually suit my skin and helped it.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product I had high hopes for my skin.  Unfortunately it did nothing and I am quite disappointed.  I would not recommend this product.  I think there should be a trial pack first.</li>
    <li> Repurchased a couple times and happy every time. It&#x27;s really cooling, moisturizing makes my skin like a baby&#x27;s butt. Very happy,</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift but I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase. Very fast shipping and as described, 16 individual face masks in a pack.</li>
    <li> i won&#x27;t purchase this again. it&#x27;s just normal sheet masks, and no matter what is written on the mask(brightening, whitening, soothing), i think it&#x27;s just moisturizing for your skin.  The feel of these sheet masks are kind of different from all my other sheet masks.  These masks are not as watery. Sheet masks i used before are more to the jelly or soft sheet masks, these are kind of like wet napkins.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Very good for my face and skin. Refreshing and cool. And it saves time I only open it then put it on my face directly</li>
    <li> Great product. Love it :)</li>
    <li> I like the selection of the different masks.  Refreshing and easy to use!</li>
    <li> Nice product with good price. Not very strong artificial smell! I like it!</li>
    <li> Great. Korean products are trustful.</li>
    <li> I love these face masks and this is a decent price. I&#x27;ll probably order from them again!</li>
    <li> I LOVE these Korean sheet masks - do them a few times a week.  I like the assortment pack, to be able to try all the varieties.  Plus it&#x27;s a very good value, buying them in a set like this.  They feel great, force me to relax for a few minutes, and contribute to maintaining a healthy complexion.</li>
    <li> I got this product on December 12, 2014, but most masks&#x27; expired dates are between August, 2014 and July 2014.</li>
    <li> nice way and price to try the different masks</li>
    <li> A bit of a strange fit, as other reviewers have noted too, but it can be stretched and rearranged a bit. Not a huge lot of difference between the different masks, but it is fun to try them - especially snail, pearl, platinum, gold....  I feel rich! I cannot say I have seen impressive changes in my skin after using them, but they certainly do not hurt. I have fallen asleep with the mask on and it did not irritate my skin. Leaving the mask on overnight did seem to tone the skin a bit. I bought thesemasks with the Korea&#x27;s Puretree Face Essence set, they arrived all together and I cannot see a difference in results, quality, or appearance between them once out of the package. Not a bad value for the money, I will probably buy more when they run out.</li>
    <li> Great product from a caring company. Repeat customer.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful and make your face feel really moisturized.  No problems, and will continue buying in the future.  Also well-priced for such good masks.</li>
    <li> for around a buck a piece, you can&#x27;t really go wrong here. nothing has caused me any skin issues, and i like the way they feel and smell. not the most change making of items in one&#x27;s beauty regimen, but a nice addition. definitely smooth the serum into your neck and decolletage after since these are VERY saturated.</li>
    <li> These are great.  I put a mask on in the morning and put my feet up for 15 minutes. They make your skin feel so good.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to use twice a week as a supplement to my skin regimen. I really love them! They come in the variety of types shown in the product picture. I use one after washing my face and toning. You don&#x27;t need to rinse, just massage what&#x27;s left from the mask into your skin and add your moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Good value for the price. The picture of 16 though is not what you will get exactly - there are over 30 varieties of this mask, so the combination you get will be a bit different.</li>
    <li> I put these in the adult stockings for Christmas.  I&#x27;ve tried a few, and they work as described.  I especially like the moisturizing ones with the hyaluronic acid.  They make my skin feel much more hydrated.</li>
    <li> Nice selection of different scent. Not sure if different &#x27;flavor&#x27; does anything differently. The product is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;More expensive products may have longer lasting effects, but this is economical enough to use it daily.</li>
    <li> It works well to plump and moisten my face but I just wish I could choose which ones I wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Asian skincare products, I found this combo pack and ordered about a month ago. I used it after washing my face both in the morning and at night, and usually left it for 20 to 30 mins. However, as I tried different kinds in the pack my face always got slightly irritated. I guess it&#x27;s because I have sensitive skin but I expected the products not that irritating. Anyhow, still a good products but not for my skin.</li>
    <li> well it&#x27;s ok. not bad. better than nothing. and It makes me spend 15 minutes everyday with it and I love the relaxation feel.</li>
    <li> Great value. Easy application and removal. I love using these and only two masks were the same type. I like the variety!</li>
    <li> They are cheap, but work great. My face looks so much better the next day. I will recommend it. .</li>
    <li> Bought for my mom and she loves them!</li>
    <li> Love these! Been given them out as gifts and we all feel all glowy afterwards!</li>
    <li> I love these so much! I only got one duplicate! I&#x27;m in love with these masks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Snail and Herb and both of them were awesome.  My pack came on time with all sixteen masks, though I would not have minded duplicates at all. It&#x27;s kind of weird to sit for 20 minutes with a cold wet mask on, but when I took it off, my skin felt great and three days later is still looking brighter and better.  I highly highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> Love these sheet masks!</li>
    <li> I use the facial mask sometimes a week when I see my face is getting dry. I have dry skin that causes visible open pores around my nose and cheek but the mask actually keeps my face moisturized for hours and a little bit reduced visible open pores. Good for dry skin type like me.</li>
    <li> When I bought these, I thought I was getting the My Beauty Diary sampler pack.  I have never heard of this brand, and I&#x27;ve been getting into Korean cosmetics lately, so I was pretty surprised when I received the package and noticed my mistake.  These turned out to work really well though, so I got lucky.  The variety was great and there was a good deal of essence in the masks.  My skin felt very nice after a few of them, and cleared up my acne in some cases.  I thought I might see more brightness though.  The only major critique I have is that the shape of the masks are a little off for my face... they seem to round and the eye holes still have the flaps attached which is a little weird.  The nose flap is also a little small for my face.  Overall thought I would buy these again for cheap quick fix masks.</li>
    <li> I just had all my teeth pulled and dentures put in so I bought this ahead of time knowing that I needed the extra feeling of beauty and the cooling relief felt medicinal as well.  I have enjoyed each one I have tried.  They help just to cool you off at night while you sleep too.  I can finde 16 excuses to use them. ...</li>
    <li> What a great deal! I love these masks! They nourish and moisturize my face well.</li>
    <li> This is really good!!!  I&#x27;ll buy more</li>
    <li> These are great and I need to get more</li>
    <li> This collection is great. It lets you try a little of everything. The masks themselves kind of slide all over the place but they are generous and really seem to help with a variety of skincare issues. I would like better descriptions of what they do on the packaging.</li>
    <li> Nice variety, my favorite is the herbed one.  Fun for spa nights at home!</li>
    <li> Got tons of packets - all sorts of variety  arrived on time.  I thought they would be some sort of mud type mask but they are paper masks you put on for 10 minutes.  I just received and have not yet had time to try one but looks very promising.</li>
    <li> Oh I am almost out and have to buy more! Great price for the variety. I love them!</li>
    <li> This is my third time buying this product. Live it! Good quality, fast delivery! Definitely gonna buy it again! Very nice to have business with.</li>
    <li> Good for before bed. Wake up looking like you had a facelift. Gentle. Scent free! Results only last one day. Don&#x27;t use more than 2x per week.</li>
    <li> These are very moisturizing and relaxing. I&#x27;m enjoying trying all the different masks.</li>
    <li> Use these once a week and leave it on for 45 minutes (a bit more than what the instructions say) until its almost dry.  Love the results.</li>
    <li> so worth it! I got 16 masks as expected and they were all of varying kinds. I use one every 3-4 days as the effects on my skin typically last for that long. I refrigerate them 10-15 minutes before using to get an even more refreshing sensation. I will definitely be reordering soon.</li>
    <li> I love trying different sheet masks from Asia as they seem less popular in the U.S.. This set seems acceptable so far (I used 4 of them already). I&#x27;ll keep trying new sets from different brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in time.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, and the ones I tried seem to be good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Packaging seems cheap so don&#x27;t plan it as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t get to choose the combo. So if you&#x27;re particularly interested in a certain type from their website (e.g. royal jelly) you may or may not get it.&lt;br /&gt;Not exactly 16 different types. Mine came with 11-12 different types, some of them there&#x27;re two of the same type in the package. Would like to have more variety to try.&lt;br /&gt;The sheet mask per se doesn&#x27;t fit my face well. It is too wide and not long enough. I guess they&#x27;re designed for average Korean girl&#x27;s face so may not fit the face of a different structure well. That&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
    <li> I ordered these facial masks not really knowing what to expect to be honest.  I have other Korean masks and wanted to extend my mask collection as I use a mask every day.  Delivery was superb.  Within two days and the items were really well packed.  No damage.  I received the full combo pack and it is hard to decide which of the 16 to use as they all sound pretty good.  I have only used the Green Tea mask so far and it is a nice, thick mask.  The mask was drenched in product and fitted my face perfect.  I have a round face and this is the only brand that fits it perfectly.  So far I am very happy and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Put it on my face and wash my it in the next morning and feel like I used $100 moisturizer last night. Soft, sooth, moisturizing. Not brightening. Cons are the sheets are a little thick (-er than more expensive kinds). Anyway, this is an excellent product which is inexpensive and effective.</li>
    <li> I recently had a really bad breakout, like as in there were these inflamed pimples along my jaw line and a bunch of tiny bumps ALL over my forehead. So when I ordered these I had high hopes. The first one I tried was the snail one and it had a bit of a floral scent so I was thrown off a bit. After I used it my face felt a bit sticky but it went away after a pressed it into my face. The mask was still soaked in the serum stuff so I squeezed all of it out into a little container to keep using and after 2 days my acne is almost completely gone (minus a few small pimples here and there) and my scars are almost gone as well. Another thing I noticed is that my skin is glowing slightly and it&#x27;s also a bit firmer which is a definite plus. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep buying these. My next one I can&#x27;t wait to use is the royal jelly and aloe vera</li>
    <li> feel good, but a little expensive.</li>
    <li> love these!!!! quick and easy at home spa day any day of the week.  Makes me skin look awesome</li>
    <li> It makes me feel so good. Thanks</li>
    <li> I havent used everything yet but it feel so good so far</li>
    <li> the weird one to me was snay-ake something like that weird spelling lol but it smells great</li>
    <li> These things are work their weight in gold.  A mask that&#x27;s easy to apply with no mess.  When you&#x27;re done, just toss in the trash.  No rinsing required.  What a fabulous invention!</li>
    <li> I use one piece a day, just to maintain my skin.</li>
    <li> Everything works. So far no problems. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot! its calming and relaxing. The product has methylparabens, so i wont be repurchasing it.</li>
