      <li>Great eco-friendly Mesh Sponges (loofahs) for very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Might want to find a better manufacturer.</li>

      <li>I am really picky about my bath products and loofahs and I am really happy with the quality of this product.</li>

      <li>Much better than what Target has</li>
      <li>Make some with more manly colors</li>
      <li>Seems to be holding up well and is a tighter ball than most, which I like.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that they are made from recycled materials.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are a great value! Nice colors and good size. I can&#x27;t wait to try one out!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  It&#x27;s high quality without being expensive.</li>
    <li> I have used other mesh-type bath sponges that have been too scratchy and harsh. These are just what you want - abrasive enough to make me feel clean but not so tough that you don&#x27;t want to use it. I also really appreciate this company uses recycled materials to make this product. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> I am no loofah connoisseur, but these did the job admirably. Be warned, however, that unlike their cucumberesque namesake, they are not made from the ripened fruit of luffa vine, so do not try to eat them.</li>
    <li> Best Loofah!! Great material that doesn&#x27;t fall apart after multiple uses like other ones I&#x27;ve tried. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> Good deal and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Incredible and durable shower sponge! Noticed right away these were better quality compared to the EcoTools loofahs that my girlfriend has bought in the past--something you may get at Walgreens or CVS. These don&#x27;t fall apart after 5 days! This company actually emailed me to see how I was liking the Pouf--great follow up and customer service! I really like supporting sustainable companies such as this one.</li>
    <li> Great quality mesh sponge. I don&#x27;t anticipate this sponge falling apart like some do - nice and compact.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing, I feel genuinely cleaner and more refreshed every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Personal preference is for bigger ones; they are too small for my liking...</li>
    <li> great price for shower sponge. They last a while..</li>
    <li> Good sponges.  Easily maintain soap lather and clean off well</li>
    <li> Great loofahs. I&#x27;ve tried a few of the others sold on Amazon and these are by far the best. They provide a really nice lather and a good amount of exfoliation without being too scratchy.</li>
    <li> Great loofah!  I&#x27;ve never felt so clean in my life!  They are colorful, fluffy, and great at exfoliating.  Forget CVS, I found my new favorite place to get loofahs!</li>
    <li> As expected. Quick delivery.  Nice, bright colors.</li>
    <li> Started unraveling the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Who knew you could fall in love with your shower loofah? The colors are fun and vibrant - they look super cute in my shower - and I love that they&#x27;re made of recycled materials and are recyclable. I&#x27;ll be buying more to give as gifts for my girlfriends.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and price. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I love these loofahs! They provide just the right level of exfoliation and my liquid soaps love them. I&#x27;ve tried the Aquasentials and EcoTools loofahs, and these are definitely an improvement. A+!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a shower pouf that&#x27;s more eco friendly, and I saw that the eco tools brand had kind of poor reviews, and my sister has been using those and they do fall apart pretty quickly. I  tried initially tried homemade cotton crocheted poufs and they just didn&#x27;t have enough scrubbing power, and were hard to clean in the shower between washes. I wanted to try something else and  came across these. I just got them yesterday but I&#x27;m already very pleased with the quality, they seem like they will really last and I&#x27;ll likely update later to share how they hold up.&lt;br /&gt;As for the feel of the material, mine are rougher  than the eco tools brand which I found to be excessively soft. I&#x27;ve used a lot of the regular brands of poufs and these seem to be of an average roughness, which I like because they&#x27;re scrubby but not super abrasive. All in all, I&#x27;m pleased so far.</li>
    <li> Decent product, but a few of the strings fell off. Might want to find a better manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality and great value. Material has a great feel to it and better than the other products I&#x27;ve used in this space.</li>
    <li> fluffy loofa goodness. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Best Sponges I have ever come across</li>
    <li> Love the loofa, however the blue one is getting dye all over my shower! I&#x27;m waiting it out to see if it goes away but currently not thrilled.</li>
    <li> Great quality, nice size, better woven than bought in local drug store. Soaps up and rinses well, not too harsh on sensitive skin. Great product for cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the guy who can&#x27;t shower without a loofah, and these ones have been great quality with cool colors. Will definitely be back to buy more of these when I run out!</li>
    <li> I am really picky about my bath products and loofahs and I am really happy with the quality of this product. Great colors, soft and doesn&#x27;t fall apart on you.</li>
    <li> Great deal on these products.  I like how they&#x27;re Eco-Friendly and they are enjoyable to use unlike other ones which I have had in the past.  The texture feels like it will last for a long while.</li>
    <li> These are very high quality and I am thoroughly enjoying them. There was an initial error with my order but he comapny was extremely quick and to fix it. I will definitely be checking out their other products based on the standard these have set.</li>
    <li> These are decent, but smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> I love my new shower poofs. The colors brighten up showertime everyday! Plus the 6 pack is super convenient. Definitely adding to my favorites.</li>
    <li> Impressa is a good brand for mesh sponges. They lasted a long time. The different colors are a bonus. I would definitely recommend buying this pack of you&#x27;re a mesh/loofah lover of fun colors with durability.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying these. I purchased these a while back and ran out. Decided to buy them again. This time around, they feel a little stiff. When I threw some water and body wash on them. they still felt stiff. For the first few washes, it was if I was scratching my skin with them.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  Great price.  Will definitely order again in the future.</li>
    <li> They work well and are appropriately priced, but, they are a little small.  I have a normal sized man hand and it kind of overwhelms the shower sponge.</li>
    <li> These are a great alternative to the unpackaged ones sold in stores that have probably been tossed around who knows where! They are standard size, pretty colors, and have been holding up great. The company seems great as well. They sent me a handwritten thank you note after my purchase.</li>
    <li> Bit smaller than I expected.  They work well but I have to &#x27;reload&#x27; the soap mid-wash to get all of me clean</li>
    <li> Received it a few days ago. The colors are super cute. They are approximately 1/2 of the size of a regular loofah than you would get in stores like Target, etc., but they work the same. Perfect for traveling or taking to the gym.  Great price for 6, and I have extra for guests.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, good service.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I am going to have to return these.  They have a very pungent, peculiar odor that has not diminished by washing out one of them with a good soap.  They seem a nice quality but I can&#x27;t stand the smell of them.  Sadly, I am returning them.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Bought these for the house - so far so good. They are compact and appear to be very well made, much better than ones I&#x27;ve seen in the stores.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely PERFECT. I am fussy about my mesh sponges. Most are too big and many are made from ugly colors and overpriced. These are the perfect size with plenty of mesh &amp;#34;sponge.&amp;#34; The price is very reasonable. LOVE the fact that they are eco friendly. I wish there was a choice of colors, but you can&#x27;t have everything!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why these got so many good reviews? The ones I received are as pictured and the brand that it states but they are small and the material is like a hard plastic, not comfortable to wash with and not as soft as others I have purchased at all.</li>
    <li> The material is sturdy, yet soft enough so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I love that it&#x27;s made from recycled materials, and very impressed with the quality and size for the price. Much better than what Target has</li>
    <li> Excellent service and good product.</li>
    <li> These are great! I love the fact that they are made from recycled materials. They are incredibly soft and the colors are awesome.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised! Love all the colors. Used are gifts at my daughters baby shower.</li>
    <li> Great quality loofas and beautiful colors! The string to hang the loofas seems high-quality as well!</li>
    <li> So far so good! I&#x27;m clean!!! Order was shipped on time!</li>
    <li> Nice product, they fit in your hand nicely and aren&#x27;t too soft or rough. Habe only used for a few days so I&#x27;m not sure how long they will last, but so far so good!</li>
    <li> sooo impressed with these!! usually loofas break apart so quickly, these are amazing!! strong and sturdy</li>
    <li> Love Them. These Are Literally The Best I&#x27;ve Ever Bought.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have been using this shower loofah for a week and has not unraveled on me yet like so many others have!</li>
    <li> The blue loofah stained our shower floor blue just from hanging to dry.  We didn&#x27;t have the problem with the pink loofah, and haven&#x27;t tried the green, but it was a significant enough problem to justify the low rating.  I was not able to scrub the blue stain off using multiple cleaning products with bleach and a ton of elbow grease.</li>
    <li> I only got 4 in my bag, not 6. Feeling cheated. Did message them, waiting to hear back.</li>
    <li> Excellent loofahs. Just the size and texture I was looking for. Will definitely be back to purchase more of these.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of these loofahs.  I think these exfoliate my skin very well without hurting it. They are also the perfect size. I&#x27;ve ordered both tiny loofahs and massive ones on Amazon, but these are exactly what you&#x27;re looking for.  I like the fact that there were so many in one pack. Good value. I will definitely buy these again when we run out of them.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> as other reviews noted, these are smaller than a normal pouf but they seem soft and very usable.  They arrived quickly with no issues, colors are as pictured, and looking forward to using them.</li>
    <li> It does the trick, but is smaller than I expected (it&#x27;s the size of a small-medium apple) and the first one has started to unravel after its 2nd week of use. The colors are pretty. But I won&#x27;t reorder them.</li>
    <li> arrived on time as expected.  I love the fact that it is from recycled plastics.  That was truly what has separated these shower sponges from the rest.&lt;br /&gt;Only reason 4 stars I would prefer a large size.</li>
    <li> Too small for for my liking. I don&#x27;t see much difference from the 1.00 ones I&#x27;ve had. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
    <li> So far, this sponge works well. I have only used it for  a few days, but i has fallen apart on me yet.&lt;br /&gt;They are a bit smaller than i expected, so i don&#x27;t get as much coverage with it as i would like, but it definitely gets the job done. Assuming it holds together for a few months, i will be very happy with my purchase and would recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a budget friendly loofah, this is your product. They&#x27;re small, cheap, and fall apart quickly.  One fell apart on the second use.  They&#x27;re barely the size of your palm. Very disappointed after seeing all the great reviews.  The ones I buy from Von&#x27;s are superior to these. I put them in my guest room for my house guests to use.</li>
    <li> Nice sponges but smaller than I had anticipated. Therefore, we will not be purchasing for our family again.</li>
    <li> These soft loofahs are lovely. The material they&#x27;re made from is very silky and soft to the touch. The colors are especially lovely, and a joy to use. Simply apply a small amount of your favorite gel and they transform into mounds of glorious suds, so perfect for a cleansing product. Feel clean and smell great getting out of shower or bath. A quality product.  I would highly recommend.  Thank  you.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use as part of a bridal shower present with some french hard soap.  They were the perfect size and combination of colors.  Everyone at the shower loved them, and it was great to be able to order them in a 6 pack with defined colors so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about which ones I&#x27;d get.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Best shower pouf I&#x27;ve used!!!! I&#x27;ve been frustrated because every brand I tried was falling apart after a few uses.  These poufs work amazing! they are a perfect size that fits in your hands, they have not fallen apart and it&#x27;s been a month. (I will probably replace every 2).  A super great value price with the added bonus of being environmentally sustainable and made in the USA!  Super amazing follow up from customer service after I purchased the product.  You can tell they care about what they do and everyone that buys their product.  I personally care about that and it&#x27;s worth paying more... In this case we don&#x27;t have to.  Thanks for doing what you do!</li>
    <li> These loofahs are a great size (the exact size I was looking for), create a really nice lather, and provide great exfoliation without being too scratchy. At this point, I feel like I&#x27;ve tried basically all the other loofahs out there, and these are the best ones I have ever purchased to date. Really nice value for six of them!</li>
    <li> these were smaller than I expected</li>
    <li> The guy who owns the business sent me a thank you card so how could I not review?!  It&#x27;s a body puff. Comes in a 6 pack. Seems to be holding up well and is a tighter ball than most, which I like. My only suggestion? Make some with more manly colors so my husband and I can share the pack!</li>
    <li> These loofahs are great! I travel alot for work and like to dispose of loofahs after every trip because I don&#x27;t want to bring back any germs. These work great for the cost and even better that they are eco-friendly!</li>
    <li> after the first one, they all started to break off and left me with a long sponge. First one lasted a while (3 months) then second, third, and fourth all broke and turned into a long string of sponge. I&#x27;m very dissatisfied of this product. I used Dove body-wash. I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t have to do anything with the body wash. I used it like how a any normal person would use it. I didn&#x27;t try to break it loose or use it rough.</li>
    <li> These are rather abrasive compared to most that I&#x27;ve tried and don&#x27;t hold a lather all that well. The first one I used had the rope fall off during the second use, the second one started coming apart after 4 days. These are barely better than the ones you get from local stores and they&#x27;re twice as expensive. Definitely won&#x27;t be getting these ones again.  Update: Impresa contacted me to make things right on the sponges falling apart prematurely and sent me out a new batch. I&#x27;m super impressed with their customer service. Will update again when I go through a few more to see if I have better luck with the rest of them.</li>
    <li> Solid product from a solid company.  As described, works well, got exactly what I thought I would.  A+ to seller</li>
    <li> The smallest and cheapest ones I&#x27;ve ever bought. They are cheap and they are plastic. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Good , just smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect size and texture that I was looking for.  I bought two packs!!</li>
    <li> I love the &amp;#34;pack&amp;#34; idea. Now I will always have a scrubber handy. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Sturdy material, love the colors, everything I wanted! I am very happy!!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  Good quality product.</li>
    <li> These bath sponges are the perfect combination of soft-yet-durable. They are comfortable when using in the shower and are a higher-quality than what you would get at the local big box store. They feel like they will last much longer than the one I got at Wal-mart, which didn&#x27;t even make it to 1 week. Glad I decided to purchase these and will definitely purchase again after using these 6 up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only suggestion I have (which may already be in the works) is more color options. In specific,  a more neutral color selection (cream, tan, grey, etc.) would be nice.</li>
    <li> Oh man, these things are great.  My body has never been so clean and exfoliated.</li>
    <li> A really high quality product. Rad colors, nicely constructed, can be used for anything from scrubbing your bod to decorating your house!</li>
    <li> Great eco-friendly Mesh Sponges (loofahs) for very reasonable price. In most stores you&#x27;d pay way more than what these are selling for on Amazon. I totally recommend and will order again :)</li>
    <li> Good quality, nice colors.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered these and loved the product quality, bright colors, and packaging. She plans to order more of these for guests to use when they stay over. Not going to lie - I love using them too for a more luxurious shower! Package arrived quickly and in perfect condition. A+ loofah experience!!!</li>
    <li> Nice, durable mesh shower sponges. Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Just the loofahs I was looking for. Perfectly-sized with a really nice consistency. The best loofahs I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon, yet (and I&#x27;m a pretty regular loofah purchaser).</li>
    <li> Pleased that they are nice and full....not skimpy.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a bit on the small side but very nice so far.</li>
    <li> I bought these based on the number of positive reviews.  They are kid-sized, and too small for adults to use.  I was also not impressed by the quality.  For this price I was expecting better, but these feel like something from a dollar store.</li>
    <li> I bought these so that I could recycle them because most loofahs aren&#x27;t recycled/recyclable. These are very soft and work well. In case anyone else was wondering like I was, these can usually be recycled in your home recycling bin. But check with your recycling program first. Very good service as well! I e-mailed the company to ask how I can recycle these and got a response just 6 minutes later!</li>
    <li> This is a great quality product. It can be overwhelming to order such a simple thing on Amazon due to varying product quality and price points. You won&#x27;t go wrong with these. I&#x27;ve been using my first one for a couple weeks. Still like new.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and only got part of my order. Quality/shipping control??? I got an open bag, 2 green, 2 pink and only 1 blue... I really ordered this for the blue ones, my wife can keep the pink and green. Makes no sense for me to return for how much it cost... But I am disappointed of package condition and missing item.</li>
    <li> Great for adding to gift bags for our friends.</li>
    <li> Great product - just as advertised. Much better quality than average.</li>
    <li> We received them a few days ago. They are as beautiful as the picture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just washed them this morning. They held up very nicely AND very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now they are ready for our guest bathroom! MANY THANKS!!!</li>
    <li> Great quality and these sponges do not fall apart for any reason! if they can withstand my boyfriend there a must have in my book.</li>
