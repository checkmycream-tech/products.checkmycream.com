      <li>Works great without all the pesticides.</li>

      <li>Smells good</li>
      <li>have found this product to work exceptionally well, but not without caveat.</li>

      <li>It has a strong but pleasant scent.  </li>
      <li>Bugs love me.  </li>
      <li>Okay, you&#x27;ve read the hype and are leery about the \\&quot;snake-oil\\&quot;</li>
      <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should not pay more than $8 per bottle for this item, as it is listed on the Burt&#x27;s Bees website (plus shipping).</li>
      <li>She wanted to avoid malaria but didn&#x27;t want to deal with most of the products available on the market.  </li>
      <li>The smell is really strong.</li>

      <li>It is greasy, and it is not as powerful as DEET.  </li>

      <li>if it actually worked but I am covered in bites right now.</li>
      <li>The ingredients are gentle and benign enough, I feel like I can bathe in a tub at the end of the day and not worry about &amp;#34;swimming&amp;#34; in the stuff that kept the bugs away.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m here to tell you that I have a three year old that gets eaten alive by the critters outside... until you bathe his butt in this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>carefully and you&#x27;ll also find it&#x27;s a real bargain (on-line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have never yet used a perfect non-toxic insect repellent.</li>
      <li>This repellent is the best I have found.</li>
      <li>We used it at yosemite for a week and not a single member of the family was bitten by a mosquito.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s gentle on a little boy&#x27;s fleshy bits...</li>

<li> To have dozens of big swollen &amp;#34;bites&amp;#34; (parasites) after spending any time at all in grass was not unusual.  </li>

<li> And neither will your little one.</li>
<li> Our friends using DEET had a few bites-</li>
<li> Just plain messy, overly-strong odor, like lemon furniture polish.</li>

<li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
<li> I used to suffer miserably for days after spending hours outdoors.  </li>
<li> Got 5 nasty bites</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> We used it at yosemite for a week and not a single member of the family was bitten by a mosquito. Our friends using DEET had a few bites- so I know that there were mosquitos about.  It has a strong but pleasant scent.  It is a bit oily, but it is a small price to pay for a good bug repellent that does not have DEET.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this bug spray on my infant daughter a couple of times with not much success.  Yesterday we went for a 45 minute walk and had a mosquito net on the stroller.  When we got back she had at least 5 mosquito bites.</li>
    <li> I have never yet used a perfect non-toxic insect repellent. This repellent is the best I have found. As Burt&#x27;s Bees continually updates their products, this product is no longer sold in the gold label wintergreen variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found this product to work exceptionally well, but not without caveat. It is greasy, and it is not as powerful as DEET.  Personally, I have found little to no benefit from OFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are athletic, this seems to do well while either hiking through mosquito areas or resting in regions of moderate mosquito infiltration during the dusk hours. This is not the perfect answer for forays into the Alaskan Wilds and billions of mosquitoes. For that, wear long clothing and a mesh hood, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DEET will always have a place. The plain truth is that I&#x27;ve yet to meet true naturalists who ALSO venture into the most severe regions. DEET has carcinogens. Mosquitoes carry malaria and other diseases... which potentially can kill you faster than cancer. When trying to strike a balance this is a terrific product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should not pay more than $8 per bottle for this item, as it is listed on the Burt&#x27;s Bees website (plus shipping).</li>
    <li> I love Burts Bee&#x27;s but hate this product.  First it&#x27;s oily and makes me feel horrible.  I&#x27;d put up with that if it actually worked but I am covered in bites right now.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my friend.I sent it oversea and they love it so much! I will purchase again!thanks</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s herbal and works!  And it has a very nice scent.  I keep my country house stocked with this spray.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Herbal Insect Repellent is great for people who want to avoid chemical products on their skin. Works well and smell okay!</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff. Mosquitoes love me and this keeps me from being eaten alive!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my 1 yr. old granddaughter who cannot go outside without being eat alive by mosquitos.  I was attempting to find a product that works without deet.  THIS IS NOT IT! After application, we took her outside where she was bitten numerous times before we could get her back inside.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great without all the pesticides.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving the item two stars because I may have waited a little too long to apply the spray, but it didn&#x27;t work well.  I didn&#x27;t care for the scent either. I don&#x27;t like regular insect spray either but I did feel the scent was a bit overpowering</li>
    <li> It seems to work but dosnt spray that well</li>
    <li> Works well, I use it to keep bugs out of my closets and off my skin.  Smells good, too!  A friend liked the smell so much he spritzed himself with it as perfume!  Ha ha ha.</li>
    <li> Smells good but if you miss one square inch of skin, you will get attacked. Buy plenty and bathe in it.</li>
    <li> Works great and has light lemony smell. Will buy more!</li>
    <li> The smell is really strong. If this doesn&#x27;t run the bugs off, I don&#x27;t know why. It made me have headaches when I used it and it is VERY oily!</li>
    <li> Okay, you&#x27;ve read the hype and are leery about the \\&quot;snake-oil\\&quot; like claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m here to tell you that I have a three year old that gets eaten alive by the critters outside... until you bathe his butt in this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOES work. He&#x27;s a fair-skinned lil tyke and we worried that the lotion might upset his birthday suit... but folks... this stuff does exactly what they say it does and it&#x27;s gentle on a little boy&#x27;s fleshy bits...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shop carefully and you&#x27;ll also find it&#x27;s a real bargain (on-line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Amazon, we spent about half what we would have spent, heading down to the local Big Box Drug Store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it. You won&#x27;t be sorry. And neither will your little one.</li>
    <li> Extremely oily. It ruined one of my shirts. And it doesn&#x27;t work. Got 5 nasty bites and I sprayed it on quite liberally.  Also the very-heavy greasiness made me hot, like I was wearing a plastic bag. Also, it doesn&#x27;t spray out very well. Just plain messy, overly-strong odor, like lemon furniture polish. In fact I might use it for that but it might be too greasy even for that. Did I mention it&#x27;s greasy lol!</li>
    <li> I use this on myself and on my dog, as recommended by our Vet. I like the scent, and it has helped with insects!</li>
    <li> Smells great ! Tried it out and it seems to work!</li>
    <li> She wanted to avoid malaria but didn&#x27;t want to deal with most of the products available on the market.  Went to Ask.com and several people recommended this product.  So, I bought it for her to try.  She said it worked effectively without the smell or greasy feel she didn&#x27;t like in other products.  If it kept mosquitos away in Bogata; it should work well in most other environments!</li>
    <li> Bugs love me.  I hate pesticides and most insect repellents.  I used to suffer miserably for days after spending hours outdoors.  To have dozens of big swollen &amp;#34;bites&amp;#34; (parasites) after spending any time at all in grass was not unusual.  Burt&#x27;s Bees saved me.  I swab my ankles liberally with the herbal insect repellent and then I can enjoy outdoors with abandon even though I live in the thick of tick and chigger country.  No uninvited bugs in/on my body.  None, nada, zip.  The ingredients are gentle and benign enough, I feel like I can bathe in a tub at the end of the day and not worry about &amp;#34;swimming&amp;#34; in the stuff that kept the bugs away.  I thank the friend who introduced me to this product every time I see her.</li>
