      <li>I can fall asleep in all of my eye makeup and still have it on almost perfectly when I wake up (not that you&#x27;d really want to do that)</li>
      <li>On its own without the primer</li>
      <li>All day wear with no smudging, shipped fast, great price!</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find Mary Kay products somewhere cheaper.  </li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t wear any kind of make-up except Mary Kay....</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this product and would recommend it.  </li>
      <li>I really love Mary Kay products.</li>
      <li>Love Mary Kay products.</li>
      <li>Although I already knew about this product prior to purchasing, the price, product condition on arrival, and speed of shipping from this seller was excellent.</li>
      <li>and I love that I don&#x27;t have to sharpen it either.</li>
      <li>I  love Mary Kay makeup........</li>
      <li>Just OK.  </li>
      <li>By far the best eyeliner available.  </li>
      <li>Breaks to easily, I don&#x27;t use it any more.</li>
      <li>Easy to use I can&#x27;t use liquids.</li>
      <li>EASY TO APPLY, IT IS SMEAR PROOF.</li>
      <li>It runs and fades easy.</li>
      <li>Mary Kay eyeliner is so easy to apply</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s smooth and does stays until you remove it,</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth, lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>IT STAYS ON, IT DOESN&#x27;T RUN, AND IT WILL CLEAN OFF EASILY WITH MARY KAY CLEANSING CREAM.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and stays on all day.  </li>
      <li>when i tried it i could tell it was not waterproof and smudge free</li>
      <li>plus its no way to verify its waterproof and smudge free.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smooth without skipping and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I enjoy not having to use a sharpener.  </li>
      <li>It goes on extremely smooth and lasts a majority of the day.</li>
      <li>I am lucky and thankful to have found it.</li>
      <li>I try new eyeliner&#x27;s and always go back to the Mary Kay kind!</li>
      <li>Mary Kay Eyeliner in black is a great, high quality product and a must for your makeup collection!</li>
      <li>Not that good of quality, not the strongest black</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
      <li>Item was exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>However I have pretty oily skin.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t read the fine print to see that I was only getting one eyeliner!  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>so it may be that it isn&#x27;t very compatible with those having oilier skink tones.</li>
      <li>Any other eyeliner from the drug store is way better..</li>
      <li>Still 100 better than any other liner I&#x27;ve used though.</li>
      <li>I have not found a better stay-put all day black eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly oily skin either, but I end up looking like a raccoon.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>i recieved this item upackaged and its not black.  </li>
      <li>Disappointing compared to how great other MK products are.</li>

<li> and it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
<li> Product was as expected, but I received it later than promised</li>
<li> I  notice a few small smudges depending on how much I put on-</li>
<li> I like the eyeliner, but just as I got used to applying the tube was empty.  </li>
<li> Thin enough for precise application, but not too thin that it breaks off.  </li>
<li> A bit expensive but well worth it.</li>
<li> Works as well as any other eyeliner I have bought.  </li>
<li> I have used this product for years, and have tried other brands</li>
<li> Not really worth the price.  </li>
<li> I bought black and brown, and both do not stay on my eyelid or my lower lash line.</li>
<li> it seems to be a greyish color instead of the black that was listed.</li>
<li> Mary Kay could stand to make it cost much less.</li>
<li> The liner smudged and ran a little.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve got oily skin and my eyeliner tends to run or smudge after a few hours of wear.</li>
<li> I had high hopes for this product, but it was a but disappointing.  </li>
<li> This eyeliner I usually use in combination with Mary Kay eye primer and it stays on unbelievably well.</li>
<li> which is usually a lot.</li>
<li> What a waste of money!</li>
<li> At least it didn&#x27;t make my eyes have an allergic reaction</li>
<li> It is not a good eyeliner.</li>
<li> So that might have made the running worse.</li>
<li> The eyeliners were rather expensive, too.</li>
<li> Very poor quality - Didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
<li> Was disappointed in this eyeliner.  </li>

    <li> Product was as expected, but I received it later than promised</li>
    <li> Thnx.  Great.  Would do business again.</li>
    <li> This is the only eyeliner I ever use. It&#x27;s absolutely perfect. Apply once in the morning and it won&#x27;t run, smear, etc.</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Works as well as any other eyeliner I have bought.  It&#x27;s outcome to price ratio is a bit off.  Mary Kay could stand to make it cost much less.</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner. Greatest seller!!thank u</li>

    <li> I like the eyeliner, but just as I got used to applying the tube was empty.  Probably will not purchase again for the price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the fine print to see that I was only getting one eyeliner!  I thought I was getting a bunch of them as pictured!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got oily skin and my eyeliner tends to run or smudge after a few hours of wear. This eyeliner I usually use in combination with Mary Kay eye primer and it stays on unbelievably well. I can fall asleep in all of my eye makeup and still have it on almost perfectly when I wake up (not that you&#x27;d really want to do that) but that just shows how well it stays. On its own without the primer I  notice a few small smudges depending on how much I put on- which is usually a lot. Still 100 better than any other liner I&#x27;ve used though.</li>
    <li> Breaks to easily, I don&#x27;t use it any more.</li>
    <li> I like it , I dont think it&#x27;s waterproof, but its not clumpy it&#x27;s smooth and does stays until you remove it, if it become waterproof I will try it also.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!  The item came in the Mary Kay box and I was happy to see it.  This product is really awesome and I will order more!</li>
    <li> Mary Kay Eyeliner in black is a great, high quality product and a must for your makeup collection! I have not found a better stay-put all day black eyeliner. Although I already knew about this product prior to purchasing, the price, product condition on arrival, and speed of shipping from this seller was excellent.</li>
    <li> This product is great! The best eyeliner I have tried!! I try new eyeliner&#x27;s and always go back to the Mary Kay kind!</li>
    <li> Mary Kay should never have discontinued this product. I am lucky and thankful to have found it. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, lasts all day.  I enjoy not having to use a sharpener.  Would recommend this product.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Just OK.  Not really worth the price.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.  It smears and runs after a couple hours.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed in this eyeliner.  It smudged and didn&#x27;t last.  I have oily skin so it may be that it isn&#x27;t very compatible with those having oilier skink tones.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t stay on my eye lids where I placed it.</li>
    <li> This is a good eyeliner. I haven&#x27;t used it to line the inside of my eye, but I think it might work well.</li>
    <li> Love Mary Kay products. Fast delivery. Good product</li>
    <li> i recieved this item upackaged and its not black.  it seems to be a greyish color instead of the black that was listed. plus its no way to verify its waterproof and smudge free.  when i tried it i could tell it was not waterproof and smudge free</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, and have tried other brands but this one is the best on the market. Doesn&#x27;t smudge and does not irritate my eyes.  Really good quality cosmetic.</li>
    <li> Same as the brown MK eyeliner. Does not last all day and comes off on upper eyelid when you open your eyes or blink. Disappointing compared to how great other MK products are.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay eyeliner is so easy to apply and I love that I don&#x27;t have to sharpen it either. It goes on extremely smooth and lasts a majority of the day. It seems like it does smudge on the bottom lid as the day goes on, but I don&#x27;t apply any sort of primer underneath of it. It has never caused me any issues and I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product and would recommend it.  Item was exactly as described.  Thin enough for precise application, but not too thin that it breaks off.  All day wear with no smudging, shipped fast, great price!</li>
    <li> I  love Mary Kay makeup........&lt;br /&gt;My eyes have contact dermatitis and I can&#x27;t wear any kind of make-up except Mary Kay....</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find Mary Kay products somewhere cheaper.  I have used Mary Kay for years and have always used this product.  It goes on smooth without skipping and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Not that good of quality, not the strongest black and it doesn&#x27;t last that long. At least it didn&#x27;t make my eyes have an allergic reaction</li>
    <li> It is not a good eyeliner. It runs and fades easy.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, but it was a but disappointing.  The liner smudged and ran a little. Which just darkened my under eye area.  However I have pretty oily skin.  So that might have made the running worse. On the bright side, it applies easily!</li>
    <li> I bought black and brown, and both do not stay on my eyelid or my lower lash line. I don&#x27;t have particularly oily skin either, but I end up looking like a raccoon. The eyeliners were rather expensive, too. What a waste of money!</li>
