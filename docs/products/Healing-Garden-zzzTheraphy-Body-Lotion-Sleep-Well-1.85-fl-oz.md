    <li> I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;Healing Garden zzzzzTherapy Body Lotion\\&quot; for the past few years, but then it was discontinued.  I even called \\&quot;Healing Garden\\&quot;, but to no avail.  I was heartbroken because I LOVE the scent and always received complements regarding the beautiful scent.  Luckily I found it again when checking the Internet.</li>

    <li> smelled like plastic. Not the same as the original. Packaging is deceitful.</li>
    <li> The Healing Garden&#x27;s ZzzzzTherapy is absolutely wonderful!  It has a nice, zingy, chamomile fragrance, and is soothing without being too strong.  Out of all the Healing Garden products, this is probably one of my favorites.  It&#x27;s the best nighttime stress relieving lotion you&#x27;ll find on the market today! :-)</li>
    <li> I have been yousing this lotion for over a year and love it.  I apply after a bath and before bedtime.</li>

    <li> The fragrance and color seem a bit different than my first purchase of the lotion in a local retail store.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and have been looking for it for a long time.  I will not pay this price for a 1.8 oz bottle though.  Get it back into the stores Healing Garden.  People will buy it!</li>
    <li> would not recommend this product to anyone trying to get the same results from original healing garden zzzspray&lt;br /&gt;has unpleasant aroma</li>
    <li> I love this lotion because it smells incredible (the scent is soothing) and always softens my hands when they&#x27;re getting a little dry.</li>
