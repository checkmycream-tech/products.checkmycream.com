### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I received this yesterday from AmericaRx and the product is AWESOME!</li>
      <li>One of the best lip balms out there.</li>
      <li>I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
      <li>This lip balm contains 100% vegan ingredients, and is one of the best lip balms that I have tried.</li>
      <li>I have been using this lip balm for years and it has been great.  </li>
      <li>The vitamin C helps to soothe, it is moist, and it tastes great, too.</li>
      <li>Works great...</li>
      <li>Tastes great, feels great, keeps your lips</li>
      <li>My favorite lip balm!!</li>
      <li>Great ingredients and effective product.</li>
      <li>It softens lips, has a nice (but not overpowering) orange smell and even tastes great.  </li>
      <li>It costs more than its drug store competitors, but it also lasts longer and has a great aroma.</li>
      <li>I ordered 3 and am very satisfied with the product.  </li>
      <li>do plan to order more!</li>
      <li>I love this lip balm!  </li>
      <li>Really love this stuff!</li>
      <li>This lip balm is amazing.</li>
      <li>It glides on smooth and feels, smells, and tastes great.  </li>
      <li>Has a nice orange scent</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really the best thing I&#x27;ve ever tried, I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say I haven&#x27;t had chapped lips since I started using it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This would be a nice addition to be included in a gift</li>
      <li>Thanks Avalon for not testing on animals, and for being awesome and practicing sustainable manufacturing techniques.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells really great, like fresh citrus with a creamy soothing tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and you will need more and more to get the moisturizing feel you crave.  </li>
      <li>It does not spread as well, and leaves a feeling of wanting to put more on.  </li>
      <li>Love the fragrance, consistency and size.</li>
      <li>We all love it.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for more than two years now</li>
      <li>family immediately took one from me and used it as they are also satisfied with the balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Has a refreshing orange taste</li>
      <li>once a day keeps my lips nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product...</li>
      <li>This is my favorite by a huge margin, and I&#x27;ll never use anything else.  </li>
      <li>I quickly had to switch back, as this stuff is the best.  </li>
      <li>Even with other non-petroleum balms I found myself reaching for it way too often, so I decided to try this as I had excellent luck with Avalon&#x27;s Vitamin C Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Container is durable and it is easy to use</li>
      <li>While the balm is on the lips, after you first apply it, the aroma is nice but not over powering.</li>
      <li>This is a great product from Avalon Organics, my issue is not with the actual product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderfully smooth, but not sticky or gummy at all.  </li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, has a pleasant sweetly citrus flavor (though not enough to lick it off &#x3D;) and protects for hours.</li>
      <li>Nice spread and lasted nice and long.  </li>
      <li>And the taste is unique, sort of a citrus maybe?  </li>
      <li>I originally started using Avalon because it didn&#x27;t have beeswax, and my dermatologist thought I had an allergy to beeswax.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s enough, and vitamin C is good for these middle-aged lips.  </li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite nighttime moisturizer for lips.</li>
      <li>I apply at night, and find this most beneficial as it has a chance to work and really softens my lips.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Works quickly to heal chapped lips&lt;</li>
      <li>Makes my lips feel super moisturized.</li>
      <li>I initially bought it for almost twice as much at Central Market, so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon for a good price.  </li>
      <li>It has a distinct orange flavor, and it is extremely quick at curing cracked and chapped lips.</li>
      <li>I recently read an article stating that if you use petroleum based products there&#x27;s an excellent chance that they will dry your lips and skin out</li>
      <li>Well, turns out they were right.  </li>
      <li>I ordered it because I am fully satisfied with their facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a nice fragrance to the balm and you are able to taste the orange faintly on your lips.</li>
      <li>VERY WELL</li>
      <li>AND AT A REASONABLE COST.  </li>
      <li>Not too waxy and with regular use keeps lips soft and chap free!</li>
      <li>issue is that I got old, unsealed tubes from Amazon!!!  </li>
      <li>very easy to get on, does not use too much or too little.</li>
      <li>It works better and stays on a lot longer than other lip balms I have used.</li>
      <li>She announced that it worked better for her than any other product she has tried.</li>
      <li>ingredients are natural and healthy, there&#x27;s no synthetic junk or strange chemicals in there like most other brands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased other Vitamin C products from Avalon with great results - these not worth keeping.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>It goes on without leaving high gloss and the container is larger than your normal lip balm so you don&#x27;t have to use as much.  </li>
      <li>bought one at my local health food store for $4 and by the next day came to Amazon and bought four more to give my equally lip-obsessed daughters and sister.  </li>
      <li>When I use this throughout the day, it&#x27;s like most lip balms, and doesn&#x27;t necessarily help or last for long.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great in this Virginia heat inside my car, and thers&#x27;s no problem if it gets cold.</li>
      <li>After running out of this stuff, I purchased another brand of natural lip balm.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no expiration date that I could find on the tubes from Amazon or the ones I purchased on January 31, 2012; but Amazon is selling really old stuff... Returned this order.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The reason I know they are old is because two or three years ago Avalon changed their packaging and the tubes pictured here are the old-style packages, and that&#x27;s what I received.  </li>
      <li>I purchase through subscribe and save and the last order is a NEW formula which contains beeswax.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I would change is the texture, it&#x27;s very soft, but I will order it again.</li>
      <li>No strong smell, a mild citrus taste, and no chapping or burning.</li>
      <li>This lip balm is not smooth or soothing, very clumpy or rough its more of a stiff lipstick.</li>
      <li>My lips are not dry as they are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I go through A LOT of lip balm...and obscene amount, actually, but I always pooh-poohed people who said you get get \\&quot;addicted\\&quot; to it.  Well, turns out they were right.  I recently read an article stating that if you use petroleum based products there&#x27;s an excellent chance that they will dry your lips and skin out and you will need more and more to get the moisturizing feel you crave.  Even with other non-petroleum balms I found myself reaching for it way too often, so I decided to try this as I had excellent luck with Avalon&#x27;s Vitamin C Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one at my local health food store for $4 and by the next day came to Amazon and bought four more to give my equally lip-obsessed daughters and sister.  We all love it.  I can put it on twice a day and it&#x27;s enough, and vitamin C is good for these middle-aged lips.  It goes on smooth, has a pleasant sweetly citrus flavor (though not enough to lick it off &#x3D;) and protects for hours.</li>
    <li> Having dry lips sucks.  It can be just mildly uncomfortable, or legitimately painful.  Unlike any other lip balm I&#x27;ve used, this one sticks around on your lips for a while after you apply it.  You can still feel it after an hour when you rub your lips together.  Tastes great, feels great, keeps your lips moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really the best thing I&#x27;ve ever tried, I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and gave one to my daughter who finally tried it.  She announced that it worked better for her than any other product she has tried.</li>
    <li> After running out of this stuff, I purchased another brand of natural lip balm.  I quickly had to switch back, as this stuff is the best.  It softens lips, has a nice (but not overpowering) orange smell and even tastes great.  It goes on without leaving high gloss and the container is larger than your normal lip balm so you don&#x27;t have to use as much.  This is essential for me in the wintertime, and I will use nothing else from now on.</li>
    <li> I always have cracked and peeling lips.  No times for those buffs or scrubs, so I was overjoyed when I found this simple solution in a tube.  This is just a simple balm, no fragrance, tingly peppermint.  However, it is soothing and immediately softens the lips.  Bought the 4 pack and will buy again.</li>
    <li> the only bad thing about this lip balm is, that I can&#x27;t find it in bulk anymore. I have one of those every room and my car, and at work. very easy to get on, does not use too much or too little. it&#x27;s great in this Virginia heat inside my car, and thers&#x27;s no problem if it gets cold.</li>
    <li> This lip balm contains 100% vegan ingredients, and is one of the best lip balms that I have tried. It has a distinct orange flavor, and it is extremely quick at curing cracked and chapped lips. I bite my lips sometimes to the point to where they are extremely cracked, but after applying this lip balm for two days in a row by the third day my lips are healed and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- 70% of the ingredients are organic&lt;br /&gt;- Has a refreshing orange taste&lt;br /&gt;- Works quickly to heal chapped lips&lt;br /&gt;- Container is durable and it is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- None that I can think of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Country of Origin: USA</li>
    <li> I received this yesterday from AmericaRx and the product is AWESOME! I put one coat on yesterday and a day later I have not had to re-coat my lips! My lips are not dry as they are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice fragrance to the balm and you are able to taste the orange faintly on your lips. While the balm is on the lips, after you first apply it, the aroma is nice but not over powering. NICE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family immediately took one from me and used it as they are also satisfied with the balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The balm gives a little gloss to the lips as the gloss is not too glossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The balm is softer than the usual chap stick so when you apply the balm, don&#x27;t apply it with a lot of pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a nice addition to be included in a gift basket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do plan to order more!</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm!  I initially bought it for almost twice as much at Central Market, so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon for a good price.  Unlike those EOS balls, these don&#x27;t dry out my lips.  And the taste is unique, sort of a citrus maybe?  Really love this stuff!</li>

    <li> I have been using this lip balm for years and it has been great.  Nice spread and lasted nice and long.

So sad that they changed this product.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite nighttime moisturizer for lips. Great ingredients and effective product. Will never be without this. Try it!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have perpetually dry, cracked lips.  I bite (I know I shouldn&#x27;t), but always looking for miracle lip balm.  My daughter finds it&#x27;s helpful day and night.  When I use this throughout the day, it&#x27;s like most lip balms, and doesn&#x27;t necessarily help or last for long.  I always reapply.  I apply at night, and find this most beneficial as it has a chance to work and really softens my lips.</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm!! Not too waxy and with regular use keeps lips soft and chap free! Has a nice orange scent</li>
    <li> Works great...once a day keeps my lips nice and smooth.It works better and stays on a lot longer than other lip balms I have used.</li>
    <li> This is the only lip balm that I can use.  The vitamin C helps to soothe, it is moist, and it tastes great, too.</li>
    <li> This is a great product from Avalon Organics, my issue is not with the actual product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue is that I got old, unsealed tubes from Amazon!!!  One looked like it had been opened and used, too!!!  Disgusting!  Also, I typically buy these by the case and have for years and years.  Each tube comes \\&quot;factory-sealed\\&quot; in shrink-wrap plastic inside the box which is a case of 16 individual tubes of lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I know they are old is because two or three years ago Avalon changed their packaging and the tubes pictured here are the old-style packages, and that&#x27;s what I received.  I wasn&#x27;t paying attention, so beware.  There&#x27;s no expiration date that I could find on the tubes from Amazon or the ones I purchased on January 31, 2012; but Amazon is selling really old stuff... Returned this order.</li>
    <li> I am a person who always has a tube of lip balm or chapstick in my bag, pocket or car.  I&#x27;ve tried them all, every brand, every formula.  This is my favorite by a huge margin, and I&#x27;ll never use anything else.  It&#x27;s wonderfully smooth, but not sticky or gummy at all.  It has no smell or taste.  It stays on a long time, so it doesn&#x27;t have to be reapplied every few minutes. If I put it on at night before I go to bed, it will stay on all night, it lasts that long.  It protects my lips from wind and sun, winter and summer, but also heals them if they start to get dry.  I can honestly say I haven&#x27;t had chapped lips since I started using it.  I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance, consistency and size. It costs more than its drug store competitors, but it also lasts longer and has a great aroma.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT FUNCTIONS VERY WELL AND AT A REASONABLE COST.  I WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE THIS ITEM IN THE FUTURE IF I HAD A NEED.  I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This lip balm is amazing. I have been using it for more than two years now and I can&#x27;t think of anything to complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells really great, like fresh citrus with a creamy soothing tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hydrating to your lips and protects them in harsh environments (like the desert which is where I use it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are natural and healthy, there&#x27;s no synthetic junk or strange chemicals in there like most other brands.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 and am very satisfied with the product.  It glides on smooth and feels, smells, and tastes great.  The only thing I would change is the texture, it&#x27;s very soft, but I will order it again.</li>
    <li> When I use regular chapstick (not organic, petroleum based), my lips burn and later crack open. When I used Burt&#x27;s Bees (supposedly organic) my lips dry up and I need to reapply every 20-30 min which h is NOT normal, only to result in chapped lips. I just received this product today. I ordered it because I am fully satisfied with their facial moisturizer. So far, so good. No strong smell, a mild citrus taste, and no chapping or burning. Thanks Avalon for not testing on animals, and for being awesome and practicing sustainable manufacturing techniques. I will stick with this brand until a larger company buys them out like every other organic brand on the market.</li>
    <li> One of the best lip balms out there. Makes my lips feel super moisturized. I LOVE this product...I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
