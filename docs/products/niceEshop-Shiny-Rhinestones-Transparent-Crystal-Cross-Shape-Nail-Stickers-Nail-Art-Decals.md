    <li> These rhinestones were perfect for confirmation. They are about a centimeter in length, and 2 mm in width. The crosses were bent just a little to fit on your nail, although they didn&#x27;t exactly fit quite right. They were still a little straight, and the gems were quite loose looking although none of them fell out. I used quite a bit of Kiss Nail Glue, and they stayed on for the remainder of the night and into the next morning until they started to fall off. I cleaned them off then with Equate nail polish remover, and they are reusable.The shipping was also great, came a week before the expected due date.</li>
    <li> No, bigger then a dime size length.&lt;br /&gt;Super cute.&lt;br /&gt;No Dimanods missing.&lt;br /&gt;It came with 10 crosses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im gonna be using Gel nail product to make sure the cross&lt;br /&gt;stay on for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took about a month but was worth the wait,&lt;br /&gt;to save money!</li>
    <li> These do not fit well on the nail-bed.</li>
    <li> These are so pretty, but there are only 10 in the pack. I haven&#x27;t used them yet some i&#x27;m not sure how well they will hold up or how easy they are to apply.</li>
    <li> these looks great!!! plus they sit well on the curve of the nail</li>
    <li> These crosses are extremely cute and i was surprised when they came, they didn&#x27;t have a single rhinestone missing! and they came early which was awesome! just wish there were more in the pack sooo cute!</li>
    <li> They are so gorg! Can wait to use them! I just got them a few days ago and I just really need to find time to sit down and do my nails hahah</li>
    <li> I was very happy to see how beautiful these little crosses are. They arrived well before the estimated delivery date. I haven&#x27;t tried them on my nails yet, but just by sitting them on, they seem to fit nicely on any nail, even the pinky. They are about 11mm x 8mm and curve to fit the nail. The customer service was very helpful when I contacted them about an empty package due to a tear from the mail service, and promptly sent out another package free of charge. I will be buying these again!</li>
    <li> These are so adorable, look just like the picture, sturdy and great. Sure dress up the nails. And don&#x27;t look cheap</li>
    <li> although they are nice and sturdy,  they are a bit to big for a fingernail and because they are so sturdy they are impossible to bend at all to form around the nail so that it may lay a little closer to the nail,  it will catch on everything.</li>
    <li> I love it. The size is perfect and it came super quick. I would definitely buy it again and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received the item within a wekk, but as soon as i applied the art, a few was missing before i went to bed. I even bought silicone glue to make them stay on longer and the glue lasted longer than the artwork.  Waste of my time applying them one by one</li>
    <li> The price for these is unbelievable and when I look for my nail gems again I will look at the shop of this seller first! I am VERY happy with the quality and price of these! IDK how they do it, honestly!</li>
    <li> Very cute idea, love the way it looks on my nails, I got a lot of great comments on these little crosses 💜</li>
    <li> So sparkly and so pretty ! ! !&lt;br /&gt;I am hesitating to use this since I don&#x27;t want to use them all lol&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s how much I love them!&lt;br /&gt;when I use all of them- I will buy some more!</li>
    <li> Arrived fairly quickly and are beautiful. Used them on a client with gel top coat and they&#x27;ve lasted 2 weeks no problem! Beautiful fun addition to nails.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for really cute Cross decals for and while and these are everything I wanted and more. I absolutely love them! They curve to my nail and I don&#x27;t need to have fake nails to wear them!</li>
    <li> The crosses are full and easy to work with especially if yu have long nails. My grandmother loved her cross which shes been wearing for about 4 weeks now....just apply a bead of acrylic and boom! Beautiful nails (:</li>
    <li> Excellent and beautiful items thanks and excellent conditions thanks very much and is the great nice and excellent thanks very much</li>
    <li> These are so cute and sparkly are curved on the nail . There so pretty on the nail sparkly .</li>
    <li> Grand daughter is the one I buy these for.  Never enough she loves nail polish, accessories you name it.  Never ever enough.</li>
    <li> crosses are way to thick to put on nails. They stick up to high</li>
    <li> my grand daughter loves these, thank you.</li>
    <li> These crosses are well crafted, they are very impressive!  It brings attention to the nail, everyone wants to  know where I bought them.  I love them!</li>
    <li> Way bigger than expected and didn&#x27;t go on easily. The cross doesn&#x27;t fit or stay......no curve to it to help fit. Sorry I tried.</li>
    <li> these jewels are just like pictured, they fit my nails perfectly without being to big or to small</li>
    <li> these are amazing jewelry for nail decoration they are very shinny and they are not as heavy as i thought they&#x27;ll be. Deff&#x27; buying againg</li>
    <li> My clients  loved them</li>
    <li> Love these cross decals....awesome will be getting more of these.</li>
    <li> Good for point decorating but its too Flat when im washing my hair my my hair always stuck between my nails and this thing</li>
    <li> I got exactly 10 crosses. All of the crosses were perfect and exactly what I expected. Very very very happy.</li>
    <li> Too bulky for nails. Sadly never got to use these</li>
    <li> I love these. My nails really cute</li>
    <li> Love these crosses but they do need to be slightly bent with tweezers before applying to the nail. Easy to break if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit. Very cute. Easy to handle. Need to offer larger quantities. I would definitely recommend this item. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Flashy and shiny. Holds just fine with super glue on false nails or acrylic for nails</li>
    <li> cute but hard to put on and not flat or curved enough to lay on your nails. catches on everything.</li>
    <li> love these little crosses! they are a little smaller than expected but thats probably even better for me because i can use em on ppl who dont have long nails. i just wish more came in the pack.</li>
    <li> love the crosses!! i use them on my nails, different craft projects, and give them out to others to share gods love with others</li>
    <li> I LOVE these! oerfect size! i ordered two sets of 10, and the only problem is one baggie came with 10, and one came with only eight. Pretty disappointed... but it&#x27;s ok! i won&#x27;t use them extremely often.</li>
    <li> They are so easy to put on, plus they make any manicure super fancy without having to do much. Look really cool with black nail polish. makes it pop</li>
    <li> These are really nice,the right size for nails that aren&#x27;t very long. I haven&#x27;t wore them yet, I&#x27;m busy in my garden now! It&#x27;s spring. Took a very long time to get. But was worth it. It&#x27;s not stickers!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t use the yet,but they look  so good and well made. They metal is strong and heavy duty. These are not thin at all. I can&#x27;t want to use them. The cost you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
    <li> They didnt work well and i am a licensed manicurist.</li>
    <li> These silver, rhinestone, crosses are perfect for me, I love how they look and since I change my nail design at least once a week (I only ever use two at a time) the price is great. I also use small plastic bows on my nails, they come in larger quantities and there are more colors. After a week, I noticed the metal oxidizing... It contrasted with the dark blue I had on my nails but that was okay since I change my designs weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are even better for my friend who can have fashionable and &#x27;church-approved&#x27; nails, something that she always had trouble finding. The pictures make them appear smaller than they are, even though the size was not a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty I love these nail decals, but for the time it takes them to ship, I don&#x27;t use them as often as I would like.</li>
    <li> Beautiful,a must have a so classy I love them they don&#x27;t tarnish they stay shiny looks life stones but it&#x27;s not a must have wish you got more in the pack but I will order again!</li>
    <li> SO CUTE! they even have a little bend and fit better on the nail!</li>
    <li> I love these crosses so much that i&#x27;ve ordered 3 packs of them! they curve to the nail perfectly securing them. The diamonds have never fallen out on me before and the cross stays on your nail with a clear top coat over it.</li>
    <li> I love this new addition to my nail art collection.  I could not find anything like this in my area anywhere.  I would recommend these to anyone looking to &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34; up their nail art at an affordable price.  I received my items very quickly and am very happy with them. They are beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait to find something new and different to add to my wish list.  I am so happy....</li>
    <li> Item was what I expected, however I only received 9 crosses instead of 10.  Good thing I only plan on using two with each polish job.</li>
    <li> I really like them!! There nice and pretty!! Your can&#x27;t beat the price!! I would just suggest not to use these for your regular nails or small nails!! They are a little bigger!!</li>
    <li> these are adorable i love them! they all have their stones secured none were missing which is great. they fit well on the nail also!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m wearing them now. Had to bend slightly so that they lay flat to my nail. When I bent them a few of the stones popped out. You can really tell unless your up close due to the stones being so small. All in all they are cool.</li>
    <li> I love these little crosses. So tiny and beautifully done. The teeny little stones are so clear, its amazing. I want to glue them on everything lol!</li>
    <li> Very nice on the nails as a reminder of my faith in Jesus Christ my Lord.  The price was very resonable</li>
    <li> I loved these as an accessory, they pop on top of a darker nail polish-just FYI</li>
    <li> so fun and pretty! i made a wonderful gothic look with them. they are larger then they appear in  the photo, but not too big at all. love love love these!</li>
    <li> I have not tried to put these on a nail yet as they seem as they would fall off easily, I will update this when I do try them, they are pretty though and I will try them soon</li>
    <li> They can secure, but several pieces had stones missing. Which led me to believe that the stones were missing before they were sent to me. Not too happy</li>
    <li> It was a little too big  it wouldn&#x27;t lay flat on the nail so it looked funny therefore it was hard to attach it</li>
</ol>
