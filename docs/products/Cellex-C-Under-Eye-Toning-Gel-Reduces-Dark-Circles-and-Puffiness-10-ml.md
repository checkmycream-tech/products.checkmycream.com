      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>no drying out areas just great under-eye toning.</li>
      <li>Nice smell though!    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fairly temporary fix.</li>
      <li>It feels good going on -</li>
      <li>it was really amazing how refreshed she looked.</li>
      <li>It would be nice to see a product that can be used for a man&#x27;s skin.</li>
      <li>Nice and cool for undereye and the roller application is great.</li>
      <li>I wake up with huge puffy eyes roll this stuff on and poof gone !</li>
      <li>and I use it under and dab it on top.</li>
      <li>An interesting aside...</li>
      <li>I think most of these products are intended for women.</li>
      <li>Product seems to work ok when I remember to put it on.  </li>
      <li>Generallyspeaking I believe more in needle and scalpel</li>
      <li>Ok so I purchased this for my daughter.</li>
      <li>This product was recommended many years ago.  </li>
      <li>Some say there are no instructions, but to me, it&#x27;s about as easy as it gets.  </li>
      <li>Seems to work fine for toning &amp; puffiness.  </li>
      <li>I used it 1 to 2 times a day and have been more consistently using it twice a day for months.</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s a little pricey (Amazon has the best price), but worth it.  </li>
      <li>It has a cool tingling feel which is invigorating as well.</li>
      <li>Makes eyes feel cool &amp; refreshed.</li>
      <li>I am a loyal Cellex -C user</li>
      <li>I roll this on first thing in the morning and by the time I get to work the puffiness is gone!</li>
      <li>Be ready for pretty strong tingling.</li>
      <li>Works fairly well but not consistently.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t see too many instant results, but here we have it!</li>
      <li>This product does tingle when first applied, but dissipates once it dries.</li>
      <li>When I first tried it</li>
      <li>and this is the product that continued to come up in reviews for positive results.  </li>
      <li>It is not irritating to my skin, or my eyes via leaking into them-</li>
      <li>Much to my dismay, this product did not work at all.</li>
      <li>I applied this gently and</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
      <li>Bought this product with high hopes it would perform, but it just doesn&#x60;t work.  </li>
      <li>It makes her look so tired even after a good nite sleep.  </li>
      <li>(if you put on moisturizer afterwards, use caution) as it will burn (not much, but you will notice it and it passes quickly).  </li>
      <li>Other than that this little tube is AMAZING.  </li>
      <li>I do a lot of eye massages and facial massages in general, but they&#x27;ve only done so much for a certain amount of time when it comes to reduce the lower puffiness/bags I have under my eyes- to the point where I just figured it was a product of my anatomy.</li>
      <li>However if you are interested in a noticeable reduction of dark circles and puffiness, I recommend Cellex-C.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize what an impact it made until I ran out of it and noticed considerable puffiness around my eyes and darker circles after only a week of not having it.  </li>
      <li>because I never really paid much attention or cared.</li>
      <li>My wife says my eyes look worse, more puffy, but I can&#x27;t tell one way</li>
      <li>This works OK but not great.  </li>
      <li>I usually use a very small amount with good results (a couple of passes).  </li>
      <li>I can see a slight difference hoping to see more of a change in the next few weeks.</li>
      <li>This is only the first application, so I cannot attest to its effect on dark circles.</li>

    <li> I have been using Cellex-C since January 2010 and have seen a noticeable reduction of under eye dark circles and puffiness.  If you&#x27;re looking for a product that erases all traces of dark circles and under eye puffiness, you will likely have to consult a dermatologist or plastic surgeon.  However if you are interested in a noticeable reduction of dark circles and puffiness, I recommend Cellex-C. Initially, I thought that it was expensive, however, I still have half of a bottle left. I used it 1 to 2 times a day and have been more consistently using it twice a day for months.</li>
    <li> Works fairly well but not consistently. This product helps lessen puffy eyes &amp; dark circles. It&#x27;s a fairly temporary fix.</li>
    <li> This product did reduce the dark circle around my eyes.  They are not totally gone but it did make a big difference.  I do not have puffiness so I can not comment about that.  I use it 2 times per day and have had it for several months and only used 1/4 of the container.</li>
    <li> Raccoon eyes gone!If you suffer from allergies like I do this is the stuff for you. I wake up with huge puffy eyes roll this stuff on and poof gone ! When I first tried it I was a lil worried about it drying my under eye area but NO worries its just a wonderful product no drying out areas just great under-eye toning. Thank you Celle-x</li>
    <li> Works well on puffiness, but so mentholated it makes your eyes water. Only for serious puffiness.</li>
    <li> Much to my dismay, this product did not work at all. In fact, my puffy under-eye bags appear worse than ever.  [[ASIN:B000HX0W08 Cellex-C Under Eye Toning Gel, Reduces Dark Circles &amp; Puffiness, 10 ml]]</li>
    <li> I have been using about two weeks. Directions are poor, doesn&#x27;t say how much to use or how often. My wife says my eyes look worse, more puffy, but I can&#x27;t tell one way or the other since it was her idea to buy this because I never really paid much attention or cared. I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s gone.  Who knows maybe a miracle will happen by the time I get to the end of the bottle, but I sort of doubt this.    An interesting aside...a friend told me he has been using Preparation H for years to reduce the puffiness under his eyes and he swears by it.   I&#x27;m not making this up...</li>
    <li> I have genetic dark circles and have tried everything to mask them.  My dermatologist recommended that I try this - it&#x27;s a little pricey (Amazon has the best price), but worth it.  It feels good going on - I use it twice a day.  I didn&#x27;t realize what an impact it made until I ran out of it and noticed considerable puffiness around my eyes and darker circles after only a week of not having it.  It has definitely made a difference for me.</li>
    <li> I reach for this after a sleepless night and I use it under and dab it on top. It feels tingly and helps the puffiness go away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with dark circles under my eyes for a LONG time. I have basically every factor that can go into dark circles: hereditary, horrible allergies, high blood pressure, etc. So I&#x27;ve been looking for something, anything that can help alleviate that problem.    This product is not that thing. I saw literally no change after faithful use for weeks. Still dark as ever. Still puffy as well. It only managed in annoying me with getting my dark circles all moist. Nice smell though!    Avoid this product.</li>
    <li> It is always hard to tell with eye creams/gels but I swear I can see less puffiness almost immediately. I use it all the time. It has a cool tingling feel which is invigorating as well.</li>
    <li> Should have used daily &amp; I couldn&#x27;t stick with it.</li>
    <li> Use it as instructed. Be ready for pretty strong tingling. And you will very soon your skin tones and those terrible microwrinkles smoothingout. Needs to be used all the time for longer lasting effect. And I am 52. One of the reviewers mention for young only -- not true! Generallyspeaking I believe more in needle and scalpel but that one actuallyworks!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t recall buying or receiving this product.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t see too many instant results, but here we have it! I do a lot of eye massages and facial massages in general, but they&#x27;ve only done so much for a certain amount of time when it comes to reduce the lower puffiness/bags I have under my eyes- to the point where I just figured it was a product of my anatomy. Not so! I applied this gently and within two-five minutes I saw a complete disappearance of puffiness on one side, and a near-disappearance on the other side (to which I applied a little again, and hope it will go down fully). It is not irritating to my skin, or my eyes via leaking into them- it&#x27;s stable and stays put. This is only the first application, so I cannot attest to its effect on dark circles.</li>
    <li> Bought this product with high hopes it would perform, but it just doesn&#x60;t work.  I am a loyal Cellex -C user and I know what to expect from this line and this one just doesn&#x60;t match up to the rest of their products.  So I&#x60;m saying that you should pass on this one.</li>
    <li> Ok so I purchased this for my daughter. She was 17 at the time and poor thing has had dark circles since she hit puberty.  It makes her look so tired even after a good nite sleep.  So after months and months of her complaining I did some research and this is the product that continued to come up in reviews for positive results.  She used it for about 2 weeks and I had actually forgot she was using it for a while until one morning I noticed the dark circles that were under her eyes were almost completely erased. it was really amazing how refreshed she looked. Then the glass bottle broke.  It rolled off the bathroom counter and broke.  I did replace it, but I wish they would put this product in a rectangle bottle or plastic.  Other than that this little tube is AMAZING.  Oh and yes once you stop using it the dark circles come back.</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this product four stars is the cost.  I&#x27;ve read a number of other reviews, and it clearly doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but this under eye toner has worked wonders for me.  On the days when I wake up tired, or just don&#x27;t get enough rest, and have either dark circles or puffiness, a couple of quick rolls of Cellex-C and within minutes, the problem goes away.  You need to be careful NOT to get it in your eyes (if you put on moisturizer afterwards, use caution) as it will burn (not much, but you will notice it and it passes quickly).  Some say there are no instructions, but to me, it&#x27;s about as easy as it gets.  Just unscrew the cap, tilt the vial slightly upwards, and roll it on just under your eyes.  You don&#x27;t need much.  I usually use a very small amount with good results (a couple of passes).  I&#x27;m on my third tube of this in three years, so it lasts!  I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Product seems to work ok when I remember to put it on.  Nice and cool for undereye and the roller application is great.</li>
    <li> Actually works!!! heard about this product on the web a while ago, I&#x27;ve never used anything like this before but always heard that they don&#x27;t work, these guys did NOT get that memo! Works great you can feel almost instantaneously results. kept me looking put together many Monday mornings in the office!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product very long.  Seems to work fine for toning &amp; puffiness.  Not sure anything works on dark circles. Makes eyes feel cool &amp; refreshed.</li>
    <li> This works OK but not great.  After some practice with it, I found that it will somewhat tighten up the under eye area a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I carry it with me and apply during the day as needed.  I probably won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have allergies that cause swelling below my eyes every night during sleep.  I roll this on first thing in the morning and by the time I get to work the puffiness is gone!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended many years ago.  So happy Amazon has a seller!  It works...goes on a bit tingly but it reduces puffiness and dark circles.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a little over a week. I can see a slight difference hoping to see more of a change in the next few weeks. This product does tingle when first applied, but dissipates once it dries. I think most of these products are intended for women. It would be nice to see a product that can be used for a man&#x27;s skin.</li>
