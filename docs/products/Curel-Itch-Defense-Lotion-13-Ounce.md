      <li>and it goes on nicely.  </li>
      <li>The pump is nice, too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than Psoriasin in so many ways!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing, going to order more of it today.</li>
      <li>I love that it didn&#x27;t sting at all and feels rather nice.</li>
      <li>Out of all the lotions I&#x27;ve tried this one is by far the best.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this after reading reviews, what a great find for me, this is exactly what I need.  </li>

      <li>Cream has a very smooth feel to it.  </li>
      <li>It has no scent (excellent), is rich &amp; creamy yet light &amp; absorbs right away into skin &amp; leaves</li>

      <li>Not a greasy, slippery feel, just a moisture more than the norm feel where you applied it.</li>
      <li>Curel Itch Defense Lotiion rebalances pH levels, moisture levels and cellular turnover to promote healthy skin.  </li>

      <li>It dries with a more tactilely (not visibly) noticeable residue than others lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Love the lack of fragrance and the smooth feel!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a fragrance free lotion and this is it!  </li>
      <li>I require something that is more cream than lotion.</li>
      <li>Probably 4 out of 5 people using this product will find it more than meets their expectations.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just one more thing that declines in our bodies as we age.  </li>
      <li>It is considered safe to use by dermatologist.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased to find a product that works so quickly.</li>
      <li>Most moisturizer products don&#x27;t work all that well for her, but she finds that this one does a pretty good job.&lt;br</li>

      <li>I loved the effect so much  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY lotions over my lifetime and can tell you this is the best, hands (arms, legs, feet) down.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Amazing lotion that really works!</li>
      <li>Curel Itch Defense Lotion truly is a fine lotion.</li>
      <li>But again, fantastic for those wanting an unscented moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Overall, the lotion is great.</li>
      <li>lotion goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
      <li>It is fragrance free.</li>
      <li>My skin is so comfortable.</li>
      <li>Its a nice cream but can&#x27;t really say it stopped the itch!&#x3D;Suggest</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work, but surprisingly, having it tested for several weeks</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>list price of about $15 seems on the high side, but amazon offers it for under $6 which is a very good price I think.</li>
      <li>Curel Itch Defense is truly fragrance free, and the lotion is rich and hydrating.</li>
      <li>my skin actually looks normal now and the relief from the itching is amazing!!!</li>
      <li>Love my new lotion, so glad I&#x27;ve found it.</li>
      <li>Curel Itch Defense Lotion, 13 Ounce, is a fine product that have helped in a tremendous way to alleviate the problem of severe itching.</li>
      <li>I bought this originally to ease the itch from a food reaction.</li>
      <li>Curel significantly improved my symptoms of Pityrosporum folliculitis.</li>
      <li>It feels great on the skin and stays moist all day long - like a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
      <li>so it was super cheap...</li>
      <li>I finally gave it a shot because my sister was using it on her 5 yr old son&#x27;s itchy legs &amp; was dumbfounded how wonderfully it works!</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t really do that with this lotion for the most part.)  </li>
      <li>The Curel Itch Defense Lotion might be ok for some, but for my family, it really doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing the job.</li>
      <li>I really like this lotion, as I am able to use it on my face and body.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now how much of that magical stuff is in the Curel is another question.  </li>
      <li>This is a good lotion that helped with my moderately itchy skin.  </li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t really do that with this lotion for the most part.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is much creamier than most and you can feel it moisturize your skin as soon as you rub it in.</li>
      <li>; since many of us will just dispense lotion without really thinking of it, assuming that you can just rub it in to your skin until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
      <li>son has a mediport and keloids from several surgeries and he is always scratching, which isn&#x27;t good around a mediport, and we are using this on him as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no bad odor there  either.</li>
      <li>I have mild eczema</li>
      <li>This actually does work and I am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Of course, if you have eczema and this works for you, then it may be worth full list for you.</li>
      <li>, this is my new favorite skin lotion.</li>
      <li>Overall this was a pretty good lotion</li>
      <li>One of my favorites ..worth the money good for dry winter skin</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes in easily and relieves dryness very well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is good lotion. Like some of the other reviewers, I&#x27;ve tried many different lotions. Some are annoying because of the scent, some just don&#x27;t see to do anything. But this stuff works. I mean, it makes a noticeable difference. My skin doesn&#x27;t get easily irritated but my wife&#x27;s skin is sensitive and she has noticed an immediate relief from this even after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son has a mediport and keloids from several surgeries and he is always scratching, which isn&#x27;t good around a mediport, and we are using this on him as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it isn&#x27;t scented and that you don&#x27;t feel like you have to re-apply it several times a day. Like another reviewer I like that it&#x27;s thick but I didn&#x27;t notice the greasy residue thing. I thought it absorbed well and that was one of the things I liked about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think its well worth $6 and I certainly plan on keeping this lotion on hand, especially with a hot summer coming up.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to test the Curel Itch Defense Lotion on eczema and sure enough, the product works very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar to the Curel lotion, the lotion is thick, fragrance free and dermatologist recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Curel Itch Defense Lotiion rebalances pH levels, moisture levels and cellular turnover to promote healthy skin.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work, but surprisingly, having it tested for several weeks, I haven&#x27;t had the eczema issues after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next to getting prescription-based ointment, this is probably one of the best products I have used on eczema and it&#x27;s under $6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it as a normal lotion, as I use another Curel lotion for that.  I pretty much use this as anti-itch or for eczema only and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While others have said it leaves a greasy residue, I haven&#x27;t had that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for a few weeks of use, this Curel Itch Defense Lotion based on how it has helped me, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife. She has very dry skin - to the point where it splits sometimes. Most moisturizer products don&#x27;t work all that well for her, but she finds that this one does a pretty good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes in easily and relieves dryness very well. Fragrance free - really has little or no smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is supposed to be very good for eczema, but neither my wife nor I have eczema, so I cannot comment on its effectiveness for that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list price of about $15 seems on the high side, but amazon offers it for under $6 which is a very good price I think. Of course, if you have eczema and this works for you, then it may be worth full list for you.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have patches of red skin we have treated with multiple over the counter and prescription meds with varying degrees of success.  This lotion has decreased the patches and their accompanying itchiness and embarrassment.  So far so good.  We will continue with the Curel with fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> I suffer from large patches of eczema on my calves, and despite prescription therapy can&#x27;t seem to find lasting relief. I&#x27;ve tried and liked Eucerin in the past, but found that it had a slight scent that was a little unpleasant. Aveeno&#x27;s eczema formulation is great for itchiness, but the forumla is much too watery for my liking. Curel Itch Defense is truly fragrance free, and the lotion is rich and hydrating. I layer this on after I use my prescription creams, and have found that this does really help the itchiness and dryness. In comparison to some other brands, this is also decently priced on Amazon though I have yet to check out prices in brick &amp; mortar stores. I&#x27;ll definitely be replenishing this when I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from severe psoriasis outbreaks and was looking for a lotion to subsidize my prescription ointment. I have been extremely please with this lotion.  It is not greasy and provides the perfect layer of moisturizing.  I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> First lotion to really help my husband&#x27;s eczema.  It was recommended by a friend.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey but the best price for it seems to be found here.</li>
    <li> I ONLY RECEIVED THIS ORDER TWO DAYS AGO, BUT IT WAS ON TIME AND VERY WELL PACKAGED - SO FAR THIS CREME HAS HELPED MY FEW WINTER &amp;#34;ICHY&amp;#34; PLACES - AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT.</li>
    <li> Love the lack of fragrance and the smooth feel!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 47 with a medium skin tone. Not sure how this all started but after a week long trip in Mexico last year I&#x27;ve had this irritating sort of bumpy, red, itchy, on and off scaly rash across my upper cheeks and on my nose. Seems to get worse in the hot summer.I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING. Anti fungal, Antibiotics, ointments, lotions, gels..........nothing. I ran to my local Walgreens and got some of this after reading some reviews regarding treatment of eczema. I&#x27;ve used it only twice but my skin has calmed down alot and has stopped itching. I love that it didn&#x27;t sting at all and feels rather nice. I will say that it is a bit \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling but I really don&#x27;t care too much as long as it helps me. I will continue to use it and give an update at a later date :)</li>
    <li> Itch Defense has turned out to be the only lotion that can quench my itchy lower legs. All other lotions have either done nothing or left me too greasy/sticky or didn&#x27;t last longer than 1-2 hrs at a stretch. Not acceptable.    I finally gave it a shot because my sister was using it on her 5 yr old son&#x27;s itchy legs &amp; was dumbfounded how wonderfully it works! Relief is both instant &amp; long lasting - 3 days without an itch after one application.     It has no scent (excellent), is rich &amp; creamy yet light &amp; absorbs right away into skin &amp; leaves it feeling VELVETY ...non-greasy moisture. My skin is so comfortable. I don&#x27;t know what it is in this product that works but I&#x27;m thankful it does.     My new holy grail lotion. I might as well throw all my other skin lotions in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered for years with skin problems and tried ALOT of products. I actually gave up on finding something that would prevent my extremely dry skin from itching and cracking. I accidentally stumbled on this while browsing online one day and despite being very skeptical, decided to try it.  And I am so HAPPY I did!!!!...my skin actually looks normal now and the relief from the itching is amazing!!! I cannot live without it now.... you should definitely go ahead and try this!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried probably 100 lotions - no joke - for my extremely dry and irritated skin. I have eczema and it get extremely bad in the winter. Out of all the lotions I&#x27;ve tried this one is by far the best. I was having an extremely angry skin attack where my skin will turn all red and inflamed. I had just received this in the mail and applied it after taking a shower. It actually relieved the redness instantly, within a couple minutes. I&#x27;ve never seen a lotion do that before. It feels great on the skin and stays moist all day long - like a baby&#x27;s bottom. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days so far and I am very impressed!</li>
    <li> Amazing lotion that really works! My husband&#x27;s hands are awful. There are patches of dry skin that are cracked, bleeding and flake off. So gross and he hates it. He uses Aveeno usually but he has been trying Curel since Vine sent us a bottle for free. The lotion works fantastically and he has been so impressed. The only drawback he has is that Curel is more greasy feeling than Aveeno. That&#x27;s why we are giving this a four rather than a five.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed with this lotion.  Tapioca starch is one of the ingredients, and I&#x27;m sure that helps with the whole itch cycle, but I found the texture to be unpleasantly powdery.  It dries with a more tactilely (not visibly) noticeable residue than others lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  And the minor (but, oh, so annoying) itch I often get on my back was not averted a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be best for itches that are serious (oozy), such that require hydrocortisone.  I&#x27;ll have to wait until I get a \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; itch to really evaluate its effectiveness in that regard.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m going to use on a daily basis because of the texture.  But if you have eczema, it&#x27;s probably worth a try.  I&#x27;m going to recommend it to my stepdaughter to try on her young sons, who both have allergies and tend to have rashy skin.  But the starch is probably overkill for anyone who just gets itchy from simple dry skin.</li>
    <li> Curel Itch Defense Lotion truly is a fine lotion. It is much creamier than most and you can feel it moisturize your skin as soon as you rub it in. The moisture works for quite a while. I found it a good moisturizer for my face at bedtime as well. Probably 4 out of 5 people using this product will find it more than meets their expectations. I, however, am the 5th person. The dryness of my hands is too severe for even this lotion. I require something that is more cream than lotion. Nevertheless, this product is, as I mentioned before, excellent for my face at bedtime. It still has a place in my regimen. I feel that if you have very dry and even flaking skin, this lotion could well be your answer to soft and nourished skin. If you have the really severely dry skin, it will help but you may need something more.</li>
    <li> As an unscented hand and body lotion, this one&#x27;s a winner. It&#x27;s as scentless as it&#x27;s possible to be, and it moisturizes very well. That said... as an anti-itch lotion it pales in comparison to Gold Bond&#x27;s menthol scented anti-itch lotion that I&#x27;ve used for years. There was nothing particularly soothing or anti-itch about this formula. So, does that make it a flop? I&#x27;d like to rate it 2.5 stars but I&#x27;ll bump it to 3. Curel, you can do better! But again, fantastic for those wanting an unscented moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The bottle of lotion I received is in a blue bottle. I think it&#x27;s essentially the same lotion, but it&#x27;s definitely not the new version that&#x27;s pictured here. Overall, the lotion is great.</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product.. and i found it on amazon as a ADD ON item so it was super cheap... my son has super sensitive skin and he complains about being itchy constantly.... this product helps him perfectly.. and no smell at all.. at all. nothing like.. like NOTHING.  for me thts great .</li>
    <li> I bought this originally to ease the itch from a food reaction. It left scars from where I itched mt skin too much. This has smoothed out my skin and it&#x27;s odorless or at least for me it is. I love it and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Anytime you put on lotion, the lotion should feel good, but something about this product feels especially good.  It&#x27;s incredibly silky and refreshingly cool (just off of sitting at room temp) and did stop a few places where I had been steadily itchy.  I had a couple small cuts on my legs, and this product did not irritate those spots at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product at the sale price.  (The current list price seems incorrect to me).</li>
    <li> Its a nice cream but can&#x27;t really say it stopped the itch!&#x3D;Suggest you go to a doctor if its persistent.</li>
    <li> This is a lotion, not a cream, so it is not as thick or moisturizing as a thought it might be. That being said, for a lotion, it does a fairly good job of moisturizing. For someone with eczema or other serious dry skin condition, a cream version would definitely provide better moisture relief. This lotion does not really have any scent. Also, while it is not completely non-greasy, that feeling does not linger. Our family has very dry, allergy skin, so we will definitely be adding this to our rotation.  Does a good job of stopping the itch, which not all creams/lotions do.</li>
    <li> My skin had become extremely dry, itchy due the dry winter climate at my place. Due to frequent itching, my skin had become red and broke out. I found an answer to my problem with the Curel lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the features are as follows:-&lt;br /&gt;1) It calms and soothes the redness caused due to dryness of skin and eczema.&lt;br /&gt;2) It is gentle to the skin and does not cause any further burn to the already irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;3) It re-balances pH levels, moisture levels, and cellular turnover and thus help make the skin look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;4) It is made with ingredients that help in recovery of skin issues quickly.&lt;br /&gt;5) It is considered safe to use by dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;6) It is fragrance free.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion, as I am able to use it on my face and body. I am very sensitive to certain products, and have to be very careful with what I use, and this Curel lotion meets my high standards. I have very dry, itchy skin, and this makes my skin feel wonderful. The pump is nice, too. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this moisturizer, it felt heavy and had an unpleasant burn. But it was a big hit with the rest of the family, most of whom have painful skin issues. They felt it gave good coverage with a minimizing of sensitivity. I also find Eucerin has a burning effect, so if their products bother you this one might not work out. If you like the Eucerin lines this is a good alternative.</li>
    <li> This product has helped my mom SO MUCH!!  She has very dry skin that itches to the point that it can make it hard for her to sleep at night.  Here&#x27;s what good about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cream has a very smooth feel to it.  Does not burn when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;- Calms the nerves to give relief --- it really does stop the itching.&lt;br /&gt;- Does not leave the skin greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;- No noticeable fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended...</li>
    <li> This lotion has been one of the best for me for my eczema. I have mild eczema and it is just right without fragrances and is not greasy and absorbs really well. I generally get the bigger bottle but I am a frequent buyer of this product.</li>
    <li> only lotion that helped my baby&#x27;s eczema</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased to find a product that works so quickly. Even the steroid based (such as cortisone products) don&#x27;t seem to work as quickly or last as long. Both my husband and I have allergies to some things.  We break out in hives, but prior to that there will be itching or a rash present. More frequently we get the itching before the hives or other symptoms. Being able to use this right away makes a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works better on me than on him, so every case and every user is different. Just have to try it for yourself, but if you&#x27;ve tried lots of lotions that don&#x27;t work, you owe it to yourself to try this one. It may be the one that finally helps you.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this lotion helped a lot.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t impress easily, especially when it comes to &amp;#34;every day&amp;#34; products such as this, because more often than not, claims made by the manufacturer don&#x27;t hold up in the real world. This cream is different. Its claim to &amp;#34;instantly relieve dry, itchy skin&amp;#34; is valid. I have recently developed a tendency to have spots of really dry, itchy, and flaky skin. I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of cream to relieve these flareups with limited success… up until now. This Curel Itch Defense cream really works. I applied the cream to a couple of itchy patches and the itching immediately stopped. I also applied the cream to a very dry but not itchy patch and noticed an immediate improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is just right so you can easily dispense a small dab or a large amount depending on your needs. And, as advertised, it is truly unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Boilermate has also been impressed with the performance of this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry itchy skin you owe it to yourself to try this Curel Itch Defense. I know it will always have a place on the shelf in my household.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a fragrance free lotion and this is it!  It&#x27;s non-greasy, absorbs quickly, and makes your skin feel soft and smooth.  There are similar high-quality lotions out there with these qualities, like Aveeno, but Curel costs significantly less. I do prefer Aveeno for use on my face, but for the rest of your body, I like Curel better.</li>
    <li> I have to share this.. I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for as long as I can remember myself and I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now. I&#x27;ve got a sample of Curel Itch Defense in \\&quot;Parents\\&quot; magazine (along with a coupon) and gave it a try. I couldn&#x27;t believe the immidiate result after I applied it on my skin! I loved the effect so much  - I had to run to Walgreens next day to get a bottle of this lotion. Amazingly soft, calm, non scaly skin without using anything with steroids in it! It&#x27;s better than Psoriasin in so many ways! Love my new lotion, so glad I&#x27;ve found it. Thank you, Curel!</li>
    <li> It says on the package that this lotion cures itchy skin instantly; well, it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I finished my old lotion which gave me 70% relief from my itchy legs, since I am not brand loyal, I purchased this one because it looked promising. It was very greasy. I applied it to my legs at different times to give this lotion a chance to work. It didn&#x27;t work when I applied to dry skin, or wet skin, or damp skin. It just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Know i don,t like it don,t do a thing for the itching problem i only give it two stars its to oilly and greasy im going to try gold bond lotion so wish me luck.</li>
    <li> Before I started using this lotion on my feet they would itch all the time, now after using this cream for about a month, no more itchy feet! It&#x27;s amazing, going to order more of it today.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended! Curel significantly improved my symptoms of Pityrosporum folliculitis. Like a lot of men, I had a chest &amp; back rash that seemed chronic - and it was super itchy with little sores that broke open. It would get a little better, but never really go away. This winter, it got really out of hand, and so I tried a lot of remedies - everything from spraying athlete&#x27;s foot powder on it, to using anti-bacterial wipes, to pine-tar soap, to long periods of not using soap on it, to Sarna lotion, all-natural lotion, and natural oils. Nothing worked, until my wife brought me her old crusty bottle of Curel. I looked at the label and read, &amp;#34;Advanced Ceramide Therapy&amp;#34;. I had no idea what ceramides were, so I looked it up and found this article:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12553851.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned that ceramides are one of the natural components to your skin, and according to the article, &amp;#34;Formulations containing lipids identical to those in skin and, in particular, some ceramide supplementation could improve disturbed skin conditions. Incomplete lipid mixtures yield abnormal lamellar body contents, and disorder intercellular lamellae, whereas complete lipid mixtures result in normal lamellar bodies and intercellular bilayers. The utilization of physiological lipids according to these parameters have potential as new forms of topical therapy for dermatoses.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What??! After re-reading the article a few times, I figured that I would try Curel. No joke, after about 3 days the rash is nearly gone. After years and years of suffering with Pityrosporum folliculitis, it seems to be going away. My chest and back look much better now, the red dots are leaving, and the itching is gone. The Curel lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy, and has no scent. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent solution for the itching. The skin is much softer and not itching as it did before. shipped within 2 days and came in a good condition.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my exema daughter since she was very young. It works better than calamine lotion and doesn&#x27;t smell harsh  at all.</li>
    <li> Up to now, my go-to favorite body lotion has been Eucerin Skin Calming Daily Moisturizing Cr&amp;egrave;me, which boasts of oatmeal as a natural healer. It tames my dry, irritated itchy winter skin the way many moisturizers really can&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s relatively expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this writing, Curel Itch Defense Lotion is about one-third cheaper ounce for ounce on Amazon than Eucerin&#x27;s Skin Calming formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what to make of Curel touting cerimides as an ingredient in this formula.  Cerimides are a natural part of the epidermis that functions as a protective barrier and preserves moisture, and - you guessed it - it&#x27;s just one more thing that declines in our bodies as we age.  If there&#x27;s one thing I know from reading, it&#x27;s that replacing something natural in the body with a topical or pill-based supplement can be just as easily pointless as effective, so I took to the google, and after browsing numerous not-so-helpful beauty sites that were more about the hype, I discovered that yes, ceramides have been found to improved skin barrier repair in at least a few global clinical studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now how much of that magical stuff is in the Curel is another question.  But for now my skin feels soft, I still feel moisturized 8, 10 hours later, and while I&#x27;m still contending with occasional eczema (treated with hydrocortisone if it flares), I don&#x27;t feel like I want to scratch my skin off, and I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed to show that skin.  The scent is understated (thank you!) and it&#x27;s not greasy.  I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
    <li> This lotion has its good points and its bad points, some of which may be things that people will either like or dislike depending on why you are purchasing the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good is that this works very well and moisturizes for a very long time. It&#x27;s unscented, which is going to be a key attraction for many people that can&#x27;t wear lotion that has any bit of scent added to the formula. However unlike some unscented lotions it doesn&#x27;t get that funky-ish smell later on, so that&#x27;s a bonus. (By funk I mean that some lotions have something where it&#x27;s kind of like whatever they used in the formula is reacting to your body scent. It&#x27;s not bad, but it is a little strange smelling.) I do have itchy skin on occasion, particularly on my legs. It&#x27;s not eczema, but it&#x27;s dry skin that&#x27;s bad enough to where the itch can be unbearable and I&#x27;ll have to use anti-itch lotion sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is kind of where the negative point may come in for some users: because it is oriented towards people with very dry skin or eczema, the lotion is incredibly thick. One time I put it on my arms and it kind of felt funny under my clothing since it took a very long time to absorb and my clothing stuck to my skin. Since my arms aren&#x27;t very dry as far as skin goes, there&#x27;s less need for them to absorb the lotion like say, the skin on my legs may absorb the lotion, so I noticed that they were sort of greasy feeling. However on my legs, no problem at all. This may be a deal breaker for people who don&#x27;t need a lotion as strong as this one, especially since you will have to wash your hands off afterwards (or at least wipe them off somewhere) to get the remaining lotion off of them, even if it&#x27;s just a tiny film. You can somewhat avoid this by only using the lotion sparingly or by only using as much as you need, but I know that this will annoy some. (I say &amp;#34;as you need&amp;#34; since many of us will just dispense lotion without really thinking of it, assuming that you can just rub it in to your skin until it&#x27;s gone. You can&#x27;t really do that with this lotion for the most part.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this was a pretty good lotion and if you have extremely dry skin then this is definitely a bonus. I didn&#x27;t really notice any of the negatives when I only used the lotion on my legs and only used it in small amounts. One thing I can say that this will be excellent for will be cracked, dry feet and I&#x27;m planning on using the lotion one night with some socks for an overnight moisture treatment.gone.

    <li> The Curel Defense Lotion is the same size bottle (13 oz.) that our classic Curel usually is. The lotion seems to be thicker that the regular one and it feels &amp;#34;drier&amp;#34; when massaged into the skin. It dries quicker and begins to work immediately. I always have an itchy back after taking a shower. I have used the Curel Itch Defense Lotion multiply times since receiving the product to review for VineVoice - and have not had a single itch on my back any of the times I used this product. There is a very light scent to the lotion but nothing offensive.</li>
    <li> My mother in laws loves this lotion.</li>
    <li> The Curel Itch Defense Lotion might be ok for some, but for my family, it really doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing the job. I have moderate eczema, and my twin daughters&#x27; can range from moderate to severe, and so far, this doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing the job. In my case, it hasn&#x27;t made a dent, particularly on a rough patch on my ankle that seemed to pop-up when the seasons changed to spring. In my daughters&#x27; case, it actually seems to have worsened theirs a bit, which has been our experience with some of the stickier, emollient-rich types of eczema lotions. This is a thick, almost sticky and fragrance-free lotion, but its success seems to be hit or miss for people who have actual eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, my wife and oldest daughter both seem to like it, and it&#x27;s done a good job moisturizing my wife&#x27;s hands which are often dry and cracked from all of the work she does here in the home (she&#x27;s a stay-at-home mom, and she works harder than I do every single day). It does seem to be good lotion, is fragrance-free and does seem to help regularly dry skin, but for my twins and myself, it definitely hasn&#x27;t been an eczema cure-all. We know well enough to expect trial-and-error whenever we try a new lotion, but for us, hydration (water) works better than greasy or oily lotions and moisturizers. We&#x27;ve had the same issues with other similar eczema-specific lotions in the past, so it&#x27;s always best to know what works best for you.</li>
    <li> Very good lotion, nice and thick and a little goes a long ways! No odd smells or anything it&#x27;s very neutral scent if any at all&lt;br /&gt;well done Curel</li>
    <li> Curel Itch Defense Lotion, 13 Ounce, is a fine product that have helped in a tremendous way to alleviate the problem of severe itching. Dry skin can easily become a daily nuisance, and itching will be one of the dire consequences when the skin is not properly  moisturized, and keeping the parts of the body that need a daily regimen is an easy task with Curel. This lotion has provided a much sought relief, and without being one of those products that is overly expensive, never know why they have to charge that much more, it delivers a top quality care without a problem. Being a fragrance free product also scores high points in our home. Gentle enough for baby use, and for facial application, one gets the feeling of a superior product without the fanfare. Most skin conditions will benefit with the daily use of this fine product, and it must be said that after using this lotion for some time, that the results have been all positive. We thank Amazon for the prompt delivery of this product. I would suggest that when applying the lotion that a person takes the time to dissolve it completely in the area being treated, for it does have a very slight greasy quality that perhaps is the main reason why it performs so well.&lt;br /&gt;I have used just about any brand name available over the years, and yes, there are many lotions that do a great job, but for the money and the results, I am happy with Curel, for it does help neutralize the very annoying bouts with dry skin and itching. 4.5 Stars.</li>
    <li> I have skin that is reactive to a lot of triggers and end up with a dermatitis on my legs frequently. It can be eczema or just irritation from elastic in a sock or nylon thread in a pants hem. I use this lotion routinely to calm the itch. It is helpful to have a product that can eliminate the most annoying symptom, therefore letting me go longer without having to use prescription steroid creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t greasy. I do need to reapply during the day to get itch relief so I keep a container at work. I also need to reapply after any exercise. I go through a lot of it but it is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another key point I&#x27;d like to make is the lack of scent. I work with some chemically sensitive people and we are asked to avoid perfumes and scented products. This is the one lotion I can keep at my desk and use that won&#x27;t bother anyone. It is a win/win for everyone.</li>
    <li> What differentiates this lotion from daily moisture is the north Brazilian tapioca starch and olive oil, as opposed to eucalyptus. A few other ingredients such as panthenol and cetearyl promote the effectiveness of this lotion to reduce itching.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and best lotion on the market. I love Curel; my derm turned me to it for my dry, flaky skin over the winter and you can still feel the lotion hours later. Not a greasy, slippery feel, just a moisture more than the norm feel where you applied it. I&#x27;ve tried MANY lotions over my lifetime and can tell you this is the best, hands (arms, legs, feet) down. I used to get cracked fingers over the winter from the dry heat and had to stock up on band-aids and 2nd hand skin. That&#x27;s tough for someone entering data all day long too. Not this past winter. Thank you Curel! Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
    <li> I live in a colder climate and, as a result, tend to stay in the hot shower longer than usual.  That causes my skin to become more dry which leads to itching.  I tried one cream that helped but did not eliminate the problem.  Thereafter, I did a search on Amazon and discovered the Curel brand which is advertised to defend against itching.  All I can say is that it works well and I have had no further problem.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this after reading reviews, what a great find for me, this is exactly what I need.  I have been using daily for about a week and already notice a difference in my skin, this is my new favorite skin lotion.</li>
    <li> My baby got eczema and found this lotion 2 months ago after struggling to find right lotion for my baby. now we&#x27;re happy with this one giving better skin condition to my baby.</li>
    <li> It,s like other itch medications.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion. I have extremely dry skin. Greasy at first but after a couple hours, it is so soft. My hubby kept saying my skin feels so soft.  It keeps u soft at all times till u take another shower. There&#x27;s no bad odor there  either. What an awesome lotion. To this day, I am still using it &amp; I live in Florida with it&#x27;s hot weather.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes with all the positive reviews, but this did not work on a baby suffering from mild eczema. I have a small patch of eczema as well so I also used on myself. I did not get any immediate relief nor long term from the itchiness. Baby continued to scratch even when skin patches were moisturized. I applied several (7-8)  times a day&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Not watery.. Product is emollient and moisturizing. Cons: Did not get rid of eczema itchiness.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I can use. This is the only one that does not make my eczema prone skin break into a rash!</li>
    <li> This is a good lotion that helped with my moderately itchy skin.  It feels a little greasy at first when you put it on, but then it quickly absorbs right in.  The thickness of the lotion is moderate and there is a mild scent to the lotion itself, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable on my skin and doesn&#x27;t bother me, personally.  I think this stuff is good!</li>
    <li> It really works on my husbands itchy winter skin.</li>
    <li> This works really well for dry, scaly skin. There is a faint scent that I am not crazy about, but it isn&#x27;t every strong either. I would recommend this lotion  for anyone with razor burnt legs or dry, red hands from frequent washing. I normally use shea butter for moisturizing, but I like having this on hand, as it is convenient and just an easy pump away from relief. It is thick and lasts for a while. Great for dry, tired feet too.</li>
    <li> The main thing for me is that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent that makes me smell like spoiled flowers.  I like the thick, creaminess of it and it goes on nicely.  I save this one for just before bed because I&#x27;m not crazy about it under my clothes during the day.  I only use it on my hands in the evening when I&#x27;m watching TV because it&#x27;s a bit slippery.  My skin only is a bit itchy in the winter but this definitely soothes improves my dry skin issues, especially the rough spots on my heels.  I&#x27;d get this again but keep it for nighttime.  I trust the Curel name for good products.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites ..worth the money good for dry winter skin</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this lotion as far as the itch defense but it actually does work. I have tried many other lotions and they just simply didn&#x27;t keep the itch away. This actually does work and I am very satisfied. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> This product does not help with my itching. It has a greasy feel and sits on your skin. I&#x27;ve tried it a few times and I still have horrible itching. However, it does moisturize and soften your skin a little. I don&#x27;t like the scent, but its not that bad.</li>
    <li> Pretty Neutral scent. Curel left my skin smooth and soft without feeling greasy. I will say however, I felt a &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; sensation the first time I rubbed it on my skin which made me think isn&#x27;t this itch defense? I prefer my Gold Bond even if it is a few more dollars.</li>
    <li> My 2.5 year old daughter has eczema and is an itchy mess all winter long.  I have tried so many different creams (Aquaphor, hydrolatum, Mustela, Aveeno, etc) and this one is the only one that worked instantly.  Within 2 days her itching had stopped and her skin looks great!</li>
