      <li>would say that I am more impressed with this product&#x27;s effect on my wrinkles than with its advertised purpose as a spot remover; for me it worked better to remove wrinkles than even retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any changes but I keep using it.  It must happen slowly overtime.  It is within my budget.</li>
    <li> Works a bit on dark spots but amazing lotion and makes your hands feel and look better just with the amazing hydration!</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted this to work but I actually think it made my dark spots worse.  I used this for over a month and I am so disappointed with the results.  I hated the smell of the lotion and the feel of it on my skin (almost sticky).  In addition, I felt that it clogged my pores too.  When I wore it during the day, my foundation wouldn&#x27;t go on smoothly and you could see the texture on my face.  Worse of all, I feel like all of my spots are a lot darker than they were.  I am really disappointed because I really wanted this to work!</li>
    <li> I like this product because with continual use, it actually fades the dark spots. However, I just can&#x27;t stand the scent. It makes me uncomfortable, so instead of using in on my face and neck, I use it on my calfs. It&#x27;s taking longer to get rid of the sun spots, but they are indeed fading. LOVE THE PRICE</li>
    <li> Hard to find a moisturizer that you can use for moisturizing, ​as well as skin lightening. Takes a while to notice any difference, however.</li>
    <li> I have used this for almost a month and see NO difference in the dark spots! You can keep it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve given this product a fair chance and have used it twice a day for several months and I can honestly say it has done absolutely nothing to remove any skin discoloration.  My advice:  Find something else.</li>
    <li> Have used the entire tube over two months time, and have seen NO improvements in dark spots.  The product has a LOT of fragrance, which I personally don&#x27;t like.  It may have made my skin feel a little smoother, but that&#x27;s not why I bought the product.  Tried it because their ad said it was effective for 80% of users.  So much for advertising.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month now and I&#x27;ve seen no changes in my dark spots.  The only difference is the pigment of my skin.  I&#x27;ve become yellow in the spots I was looking to correct.  Sure it makes my skin smooth and it smells good, but it does NOTHING for my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m more than a little disappointed in the product.  Save yourselfs and just cover it up with make-up</li>
    <li> I have always had beautiful clear and smooth skin. I used it to clear up the occasional dark spots from a old previous pimple or two. It started to tighten my skin, and make it really shiny looking (oily), I thought it was working but only one spot really got cleared up, and I started getting little bumps on my cheeks around my nose. I noticed it wasn&#x27;t working so I stopped using it. So now I breakout all the time. This product messed up the natural balance of my skin. Nothing will stop me from breaking out. This product messed up my skin. I should have never brought it. One of the worst products ever....do not ever purchase especially if you have sensitive skin which I have. THIS PRODUCT DOESN&#x27;T EVEN DESERVE A STAR.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see all of the negative reviews-I love this stuff! I had a horrible reaction to a new face cream and it left huge cystic acne all over my face (obviously very devestating, especially since I have never had skin issues) it took a long time for them to all go away and it left dark acne scars behind, I bought this stuff with out even looking up the reviews. It was the  cheapest dark spot corrector there too. Wow am I glad I bought it! It&#x27;s just been a couple days (twice a day) and it&#x27;s already made a huge improvement! I can&#x27;t wait to see what the next couple of weeks bring!</li>
    <li> i guest i need to use it for longer did not notice a difference</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now and it&#x27;s great.  I have seen a noticeable difference in the appearance of my dark spots and my over all skin tone.  I will continue to use this and the price amazon offers, is GREAT</li>
    <li> I had blotches on the neck from years of shaving incorrectly. well this cleared the uneven tone and i get compliments from women all the time on my even tone skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;im also a repeat user! brothers let your selves shine through.</li>
    <li> I bought this item with a lot of hope. I&#x27;m 63 and needed help. It seemed to work after a while...about a third of the tube. There was a slight difference and I became excited. After about half way through, I was putting it on and this red mucuslike stuff came out and I was horrified. I can&#x27;t bring my self to use it again. I don&#x27;t know what it could be but I&#x27;m not going to try another tube. Too bad, it seemed to be helping too.</li>
    <li> After extensive one year trial on 1 Dark spot caused by sun damage, I can tell you it didn&#x27;t work for me. I was religious about applying this product daily and generously on that spot directly, but still no results after one year of daily use. That&#x27;s too bad, I hope it works for someone though.</li>
    <li> This product is just great! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and already see a difference in the appearance and softness of my skin. It smells really good too. I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for the past 10 years and have scars to prove it, but the dark spot corrector has already started to diminish the marks on my face.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a while ago and I was hoping that it would correct my dark spots.  I have been using it for more than 2 months.  It didn&#x27;t show any improvement.</li>
    <li> This is a waste of time. I noticed only a 5% - yes, that&#x27;s only FIVE percent difference on the one acne scar I have on the tip of my nose, and the same goes for dark age spots.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with this.  It&#x27;s pure crap and it smells horrid like old expired medicine.</li>
    <li> I have been useing it for 3 weeks and i can see a difference already. it takes time and weather or not a skin care will work on someone depends on the skin type, age, ect. for me who is 29 and has had bad acne scar&#x27;s i see a difference and i will buy this again. what works on one person might now work on others...</li>
    <li> Nothing makes me break out but within 24 hours my face was a mess!  Don&#x27;t let the price fool you just cause it&#x27;s cheap it&#x27;s not worth trying to clear up your skin after!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three months, and it doesn&#x27;t work.  I am going to finish the tube (about 1/3 of the way through), and if I see any results, I will update my review.  But for now, I am not a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months. I absolutely love it! It has faded my acne scars on my chin and has actually improved the appearance of wrinkles on my forehead. My skin has become more one shade and has gotten rid of my redness. My complexion is brighter, smooth and any scarring is faded. I think people rate this product very low because they expect instant results for severe scarring. My trick is to exfoliate daily and use this product. Together you will see amazing results. I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I bought a tube of this in September because I wanted to get rid of the dark age spots on the back of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;What I do is apply a generous dot the same size as the age spot, and then I leave it there for about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Then I rub it in. I only do it once a day, and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant change, but the process is slow. I guess I could apply it more often--I just forget to. My age spots are still there, but have REALLY faded. It does work.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product as it didn&#x27;t contain hydroquinone and I guess I fell for the advertising hype (that 80-some percent showed results). So I used it faithfully morning and evening for 3 months and saw absolutely no change whatsoever. My age spots aren&#x27;t prominent, so I expected just a little more than I got. I went back to the hydroquinone product that I had been using (my Dermatologist recommended it anyway).</li>
    <li> UPDATE #4-- 01/18/12:  I continue to use the Garnier twice a day. Nothing has changed since my last update around 6 weeks ago. It&#x27;s a good product but will only do so much for the dark spots. They are lighter than when I first started with this, but not gone. The tube is almost used up, I won&#x27;t re-purchase. Good luck with your attempt at spot removal! :)&lt;br /&gt;****************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE #3-- 12/01/11: Sorry, a couple days late on my update. My spots look the same as a month ago. No change. I tried something new, the Peter Thomas Roth Unwrinkle Peel Pads, but they made me so dry I quit using those. Now I&#x27;m back to the Garnier as at least it&#x27;s not drying. But as far as the dark spots being completely eliminated, I don&#x27;t think anything over-the-counter will do that.&lt;br /&gt;*****************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE #2-- 10/28/11:  Another month has passed.  Not much has changed, the smaller dark spots are the same as a month ago.  It&#x27;s funny that the largest dark spot now looks like 3 smaller freckles, so I notice the most change on my largest spot. Hyper-pigmentation....I&#x27;m not so sure this works for that. I&#x27;m halfway through the tube so unless things change, I will probably not buy another tube. I&#x27;m also taking a star off my rating, 3 stars means \\&quot;It&#x27;s OK\\&quot;. I&#x27;ll see you again in another month!&lt;br /&gt;*****************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE #1-- 09/28/11:  As of today&#x27;s date, I have been using this 2 months.  There is now a very noticeable change in my dark spots, but they are still not 100% gone - yet.  Most of the time I use this 2 times/daily. Twice a day seems to have kicked it up a notch and I recommend 2X a day if your skin can handle it.&lt;br /&gt;*****************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, sensitive skin, a couple of dark spots and some hyper-pigmentation from tanning bed use years ago. I&#x27;ve been using this for a month, a minimum of 1X a day, 2X a day when I remember to use it at night. (I purchased mine at Wal-Mart, but it&#x27;s cheaper here at Amazon; however, Amazon can&#x27;t keep it in stock since it&#x27;s so popular).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very thin, white lotion, almost like a serum. The directions say to apply daily over face and neck. Applying it twice a day hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garnier markets this as both a dark spot remover and a moisturizer; if your skin is oily you probably won&#x27;t need additional moisture, but I do since I&#x27;m dry. Either skin type, oily or dry, you still need to apply an SPF over this or the spots will come back!a month, a minimum of 1X a day, 2X a day when I remember to use it at night.

    <li> The active ingredient in this that lightens dark spots is vitamin C, which I just learned becomes ineffective when it&#x27;s exposed to air.  Which explains why I used this cream and saw good results for the first two weeks or so, then it just stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did some Googling and found out that you can buy vitamin C powder (either L-ascorbic acid or magnesium ascorbyl phosphate) and just add it to your regular moisturizer (after mixing the powder with a little water first), and you can make your own affordable, potent vitamin C cream.  They say to make it in small batches so it&#x27;s always fresh and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used both L-ascorbic acid and magnesium ascorbyl phosphate and liked both but I like the MAP better.  The L-ascorbic is a little harsher but that may be good for more oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> Not working at all for neither spot nor wrinkle.  I have been using it faithfully for the last 3 months.</li>
    <li> I use this twice daily and have to admit the brown spots are less visible.  Not gone but lighter.  I&#x27;m hoping they continue to lighten until completely gone.  It doesn&#x27;t give you info about how long to use it for maximum benefit or if you have to keep using it forever or the spots will come back.  Smells and feels nice on your skin and kind of like a moisturizer.  Satisfied overall.  Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> After 2 months of using it, twice a day, my dark spot on my face has been fading a bit but not much.&lt;br /&gt;It is not working well on me though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product steadily for about three weeks. I have finally noticed definite improvement by using it once daily. I like the fact that I&#x27;m seeing fade-off in the skin discoloration; remaining problem is twofold, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One: I now have pale marks on my skin around the regular skin pigment, which is better than it was (not brownish, when I&#x27;m supposed to be fair-skinned Irish), but it&#x27;s still not an even tone. That is, the discoloration has seemingly faded to PALER than my regular surrounding skin tone. However, I have makeup for addressing that, and it&#x27;s probably the best I can do with it, and that&#x27;s not so bad. It&#x27;s easier to cover lighter spots to even out skin tone than mask darker ones on my lighter skin, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two: Although I am over 50, this formula tends to make my cheeks break out. My skin has always been oily and sensitive, but I haven&#x27;t had lumpy pimply things in a few years. This stuff is, in my opinion, likely to promote acne if you are prone to it. So make sure you wash your face well at night to remove all residue, just in case. Use exfoliator and salicylic acid products to clear out your pores in a reasonable manner, and you&#x27;ll probably do pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a good product, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker. However for the price, I think it&#x27;s a good value and just as likely to give you good results as the much pricier stuff. So I say it&#x27;s worth the price, which is higher than I would usually want to pay for a drugstore thing. And I&#x27;m absolutely not going to spend megabucks on the fashionable department store fluff brands, I don&#x27;t care what they swear they can do. It&#x27;s a ripoff when stuff like this, at this price point, actually works well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product 2x a day for 10 days now. Starting on day 8, I got out of the shower and began my usual beauty routine of putting on this product and then foundation, when I realized that I didn&#x27;t need foundation! My dark spots were still there, yet not obvious. Like another reviewer said, this product did not fade my dark spots miraculously (yet - it&#x27;s only been 10 days), but after a week, the red patches around my nose were gone and also, the very tiny lines around my mouth have disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some there may be a \\&quot;purging\\&quot; phase. I have always had acne on my forehead,but nowhere else. The product gave me bad acne for 6 or 7 days (only on my forehead) -- I knew this was purging and not an allergic reaction because the rest of my skin would have broken out. At day 11, I have 1 pimple left on my forehead. I almost abandoned the product due to the initial breakout, but I stuck with it and am glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is 5% Vitamin C, which is pretty good for the price. Vitamin C works -- it should refine the skin, even out skin tone, and fade light to medium spots; however, vitamin c is not for everyone and the only way is to find out what works for you. Also, it takes time -- you must apply the product 2x a day daily while also exfoliating regularly and using a good moisturizer with spf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product until it is gone, and I have a feeling that I won&#x27;t have to wear foundation anymore at all! I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> I am a very picky person when it comes to cosmetic ect. I had been struggling to find a perfect stuff to get rid of the dark spot on my cheeks ( after I delivered my 1st baby,I found out I got brown dark spots on my left and right cheeks ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read and watched this ads about Garnier.So,I decided to try. I used it back in Sept 12th&#x27;11 ( the day my Mom in law&#x27;s bday ) till April&#x27;12. Did I see any difference ? No :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people say it works within 8 weeks. I kept checking every week, nothing happened. It only makes my skin felt so smooth, not oily, but other than that, no reduction on the spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking, maybe it works for those whose light skin, meanwhile I&#x27;m Asian, tend to have brown skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again ? Probably.Just because I like the feel on my skin. But, I will put away the thought that it will correct the dark spots. Nah, I don&#x27;t buy that ads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck for others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still searching the right now.</li>
    <li> I agree with what others have said. You need to get both the spot corrector and the night mask. Then you&#x27;ll notice changes in about 3-4 weeks. I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> This is the second month I have been using this product. I was reluctant about using another so-called miracle product after all the misery I went through...I eventually decided to give it a try.Although I didn&#x27;t notice any significant improvement during the first two weeks,things improved dramatically the next two weeks and just after a month, I could perceive a remarkable enhancement in my face tone, plus a partial disappearance of black spots. Of course, they are not fading as fast as I would like. A major drawback I had to contend with so far is insomnia. Yes, when I use this product at night, I can&#x27;t turn in easily as I used to. The high level of Vitamin C could account for that, that&#x27;s I would recommend other customers not to wait until time to go to bed before applying it.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure: if things change I will come back and  take some stars off.</li>
    <li> This is a good product at a good price.  I have used more expensive products.  Can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using for several weeks. So far, I have not been able to tell the difference. Still waiting.</li>
    <li> save your money and dont go buy this produc, I have been trying it faithfully for 2 months and have not seen any improvement.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 5 months and only saw a fraction of a difference in my dark spot.  I have one dark spot on my face that is slightly larger then the tip of the end of a pencil eraser.  I spot treated the area twice daily with a generous amount of the product.  I feel that I gave it more then enough time to do the job it claimed it would do and it fell short.  I have since thrown it out and switched to Cold Pressed Rosehip Seed Oil.  I do not recommend Garnier Dark Spot Corrector.  Debi B.</li>
    <li> These products can be exspensive and come in little tubes. I found a scar gel at the Dollar Tree that works really well to remove acne scars and any other scars. My natural skin tone is back and I do not have to wear makeup anymore!</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF DOES NOT WORK AT ALL.  I have used it for four months and nothing is different.  Don&#x27;t wast your money.  I would have given no stars if I could have.  I am so disgusted with the product because it didn&#x27;t work and very frustrated.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this 3.5 stars, because it did cool things but not what it was supposed to, and also had some undesirable side effects. But for the sake of the cool stuff, I will round up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for almost 2 months and I still have mixed feelings about it, though I think I will keep using it just to see what other stuff happens. Here are my observations thus far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This morning, I suddenly realized that all the wrinkles on my forehead have disappeared, prompting me to write this review. I figured this might be something other people would also be interested in waking up to one day. I would not say I had deep wrinkles on my forehead but they were definitely there; whenever I smiled or squinted they would bunch up and become pronounced. However, no matter what faces I make at myself in the mirror, they now appear to be gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. As for disappearing spots, I cannot say I am quite as pleased. After almost two months of using this product, usually twice a day, my \\&quot;control spots\\&quot; (the ones I made a conscious effort to note and check periodically to figure out if this stuff works) are still present. I think they have faded a bit, but that is overshadowed, in my case, by an unfortunate side effect of this product that I was forwarned about by other reviews but decided to ignore, which brings me to my next point...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. This product has caused me major acne outbreaks. HOWEVER, I suspect this is because this product seems to work similarly to retinol, which I have used in Rx strength in the past. I think this product works by speeding up the renewal of skin, which retinol also does, leading to major initial acne outbreaks as the source of the acne is brought quickly to the surface of the skin. Though I initially had a major flare-up, it has gotten better the longer and more consistently I have used this product. I am not a doctor and I don&#x27;t know if my guess at why this product causes acne flare-ups is correct, but its effect on my skin *felt* similar to retinol; my skin is smoother but feels sort of thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that I am more impressed with this product&#x27;s effect on my wrinkles than with its advertised purpose as a spot remover; for me it worked better to remove wrinkles than even retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, since it makes my skin feel thin, I would recommend that if you use this product, you follow the instructions and be neurotic about simultaneously using sunscreen.rect, but its effect on my skin *felt* similar to retinol; my skin is smoother but feels sort of thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that I am more impressed with this product&#x27;s effect on my wrinkles than with its advertised purpose as a spot remover; for me it worked better to remove wrinkles than even retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, since it makes my skin feel thin, I would recommend that if you use this product, you follow the instructions and be neurotic about simultaneously using sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance and it feels real smooth on my skin but I still don&#x27;t see a&lt;br /&gt;difference on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it another month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for a few months now, and I&#x27;ve noticed no change in my dark spots. I&#x27;m not sure what it does, except perhaps moisturize. If you have a naturally shiny face, definitely don&#x27;t get this stuff, it will only compound the problem. I will say that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. But I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Originally I started using the Clique version of this product around fall of 2011.  I went thru two bottles of the stuff at 40 bucks a pop not including shipping/tax.  I was SLOWLY starting to see results, but would you really want it any other way and risk damaging your skin?  Think about it.  I got sick of paying the high price for Clinique so looked around for something similar made by another company.  I am so glad I found the Garnier version of the dark spot corrector, which picked up from where the first one left off and finally got rid of the largest most annoying dark spot on my face.  I LOVE this product. It seems like the same stuff to me, smells and looks the same, at half the price. For me, I can say it seemed to work a little bit faster than the Clinique.  Keep using it and remember to stay out of the sun and always use sun block.  I have a medium skin tone with freckles and was starting to see lots of those nasty, irregular sun damage blotches on my face.  A nice bonus is this has closed up my large pores and now my skin is less oily.  I feel good again about going without foundation and just a little blush on my face.  Give it a try, at this price you have nothing to lose.  Remember it&#x27;s a process, not instant gratification, I didn&#x27;t seen results until about 9 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never know whether it works or not, can&#x27;t stand to use it.  Very strong, persistent, chemical-y fake-fruity smell.  If you&#x27;re sensitive to strong odors like I am (or had just rather choose what you smell like), not a good idea.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks now and already my skin is much clearer and the dark spots are fading quickly! I wasn&#x27;t too sure about the smell at first because it smelled like self-tanner and stuck even on my hands all day, but I didn&#x27;t notice it after a weeks worth of use. Not sure if I just got used to the smell or if it was just my skin smell and the lotion smell combining funny. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this product again! I use it with the overnight peel and that works wonders as well!</li>
    <li> So far not so bad. Smells more like clinical product. Does not burn when using. will see if it works. shipment Delivery was really fast.</li>
    <li> Orde rd received in a timely manner. Lotion did not fade brown spot</li>
    <li> I do a lot of gardening so dark spots are a fact of life. I use these creams to keep them from taking over half my face. I used to use the Nutra Luxe MD Snow White Whitening Day Creme - works well, but very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for something less expensive, I bought this based on the reviews here. It doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as the Nutra Luxe, however. It&#x27;s adequate, but much more watery than the Nutra Luxe. Citrus scent is pleasant. Because of the excess water, it actually isn&#x27;t that much cheaper - you use easily twice as much as the more concentrated Nutra Luxe Snow White.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product through my local store, and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  So I applied it as directed on the package, and couldn&#x27;t keep it on my face for more than 30 min. The smell of the products is very strong. I am very sensitive to fragrances, and should have looked more closely for a fragrance free product. So, I am not sure the product actually works, but thought I would review it based on the strong smell. Why do they put fragrance in face products? You have been warned. Do not buy if you are sensitive to perfumes.</li>
    <li> I mainly purchased this to lighten up my old acne scars. I have been using it for about a month on and off and I can say that some of my scars have lightened a bit. I will definitely continue using this. It is also a pretty good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, how well you think it works depends on your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man... I&#x27;ve really gone back and forth with this product. But after using it for a couple months, here&#x27;s my thinking.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;d sort of like some dark spots to be faded, but don&#x27;t want to spend big bucks... this product may be for you. It does work, but I don&#x27;t think it is going to totally erase anything. I&#x27;ve used it twice a day for a couple months, and it faded the offending spot anywhere from 25% to 50%. I suspect Mr. Spot is going will make a return visit when I quit using this... we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dark spots that are causing you distress, and you feel they must be gone... don&#x27;t buy this or any other product. Save your money for a laser treatment because that&#x27;s probably the only thing that will get rid of a spot totally and forever... or find a good concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient is Vitamin C, so it stings a tiny bit when you put it on. If you are trying to de-spot a large area of your face, this might really be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product sort of messed with my head. I really WANTED it to be a drugstore miracle product... don&#x27;t we all want something like that? So much so that I think my mind exaggerated the progress the first few days.</li>
    <li> I began using Garnier Dark Spot Corrector only about 10 days ago.  I have definitely noticed a lighting in several of the sun spots, along with residual acne scars.  I don&#x27;t have any unrealistic expectations for any product being able to remove spots 100%, but I&#x27;m definitely satisfied on how well it has lightened them.  I also should clarify that my spots are not large spots, nor are they dark brown/black spots, so thus this may be why this product works so well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this product.  I&#x27;m happy with it&#x27;s results, in only 10 days!  Thanks Garnier!!</li>
    <li> I have used just about everything to try and get rid of my red acne scars that i have had for over 15 years! Even tried cindy crawfords over-priced meaningful beauty and still had red marks....tried this thinking its not gonna work either....boy was I wrong! They are almost gone! I have very very fair skin...so red marks look really red on me...now they are a pale pink almost gone by this wonderful cream! Anyone with acne scars should try this...it may not work for some but it worked for me and it even cleared up my breakouts...must be the C that cleared it up as well. It beats the over-priced crap! Oops forgot to say I have been using it for a month now.</li>
    <li> I have no idea if this product works. Less than 10 minutes after I applied it, I spent 15 minutes trying to rinse, wash, then scrub it off my face. I can still smell it as strongly as if I&#x27;d just applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a BAD smell, but it&#x27;s insanely strong. Imagine mixing one drop of lotion with 3 big squirts of your favorite perfume and then rubbing it all over your face. No thanks. It&#x27;s in my nose &amp; I can&#x27;t stop smelling &amp; tasting it. Yuck.</li>
    <li> I can also use the mineral spray when I feel my face begin to flush; If you have sensitive skin prone to reddness, you know what I&#x27;m talking about.  After you use this does it make a difference? Maybe. I&#x27;ll tell you it does every time you ask though.</li>
    <li> I have old age dark spots. I used this according to the package directions. It did nothing to reduce or minimize the look of the dark spot.</li>
    <li> When I bought this product I tried it for a couple weeks and was disappointed by the lack of results. But then I decided to just put the product on one large dark spot on my face and see what happened. It has slowly but surely disappeared, just a hint remains. Then I started putting it on my upper chest where I had a variety of light and dark spots. What I observed is that the light ones go away quickly and the dark dark ones take months of using the product consistently. So I would recommend using the product before the dark spots get out of hand. I am now using the product on my forearms which were just starting to get covered with dark spots and I&#x27;ve only been using it consistently for about 3 weeks and already I can see a difference. I am still using my original tube, so it lasts a long time. Use it daily and the sooner the better is my advice. I did not notice it drying out my skin, maybe because I am only putting it on the dark areas and not all over.</li>
    <li> Used faithfully for two months. Not only was there NO CHANGE in the dark spots, but it made my skin oily and break out. That rarely happens to me. I do not have sensitive skin. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I saw the advertisement on television and said I&#x27;m desperate to try anything at this point to soften my acne scars. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and I recommend this product to anyone with blemish spots on their face.</li>
    <li> This product burned the areas under my eyes down to the mid section of my face. The center of both cheeks were burning and developed a rash. After a couple of days the burned portions peeled. I didn&#x27;t learn my lesson. I tried again after a week of clearing. This happened again. I only used, LITERALLY, a very small amount (a dot) under each eye and smooth over each cheek. I bought this product for under eye darkness. The commercials and advertisements caught my attention.This product is just not for me. I might be allergic to an or some ingredient(s) in this product.  Jackie</li>
    <li> Okay, so far it&#x27;s day two.....too early for results but, the gentleness of this product is amazing. It&#x27;s not even greasy, no stinging and that pleasant citrus smell......good feeling about this product. Will extend this review when I reach my one month mark.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conscientiously on some dark spots on my face, and liver spots on my hands. Maybe it&#x27;s wishful thinking, but it does seem to lighten the spots - not eradicate them - so they are less obvious. That&#x27;s an improvement on anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> The product worked great and I recommend it for anyone to use. This product worked without any problems once so ever!</li>
    <li> I was anxious to try this product after seeing the commercials because I wanted to get rid of some acne scars on my cheeks. Initially, I was impressed the very first time I applied it to my face. It did sting a little, but nothing unbearable. The scent is strong, but again, nothing unbearable unless you are sensitive to fragrance. I did think at first that it gave my skin a glow, which only made me more excited and more apt to continue using it regularly. This was about 2 months ago. I now have even worse scarring! Apparently, this made me breakout more than usual, leaving behind new scars to add to my preexisting ones. And this was just as I was getting my breakouts under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just begun a mission to get rid of these acne scars. People with these scars really know how much it negatively effects confidence and self image, so I am religiously trying to do what I can to rid of them. I am using Proactiv to help control the breakouts, and also using microdermabrasion. I just bought Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion and Peel Kit, but before that I would use MaryKay Microdermabrasion every now and then. I have also started using Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer. So far it feels great and is no where near as oily as the Garnier, so hopefully it&#x27;s a keeper. Another thing I bought was Ambi&#x27;s Fade Cream, which will hopefully speed up the diminishing process. It may sound like facial overload, but there are far more vigorous and invasive options out there (such as laser treatments and chemical peels) and I am desperate to have even semi clear skin, so hopefully what I&#x27;m doing will be enough to help me and others out there with similar issues. Speaking of chemical peels, if none of these options work to remove my acne scars, Skin Laboratory offers a variety of peels through Amazon that I will certainly look into, and would encourage others to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, I would NOT recommend this product to anyone, especially if you have acne prone skin. It will probably just make everything worse. On top of that, it leaves an unpleasant residue on your skin.e prone skin. It will probably just make everything worse. On top of that, it leaves an unpleasant residue on your skin.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-20s and suffer from mild acne, some dark spots (sun damage and acne scars) and no wrinkles. I thought I&#x27;d try this after one large spot next to my eye really started bothering me. I have used the product for three weeks so far and it has slightly lightened the spot. Nothing earth-shattering, but a noticeable improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there have been other benefits. My acne has decreased since starting this product. At first, I got a few whiteheads, which is abnormal for me, but after a few days my skin looked clear. Overall, my skin looks smoother and more radiant as well as more even toned. Vitamin C applied topically can work wonders and this is a pretty cheap way to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe about this product is the smell. At first it smells fine, but once it dries, it reminds me of a self tanner smell, or a metallic smell. I really, really hate it. It probably has something to do with the oxidizing of the vitamin C, but ICK! I will put up with it for the benefits of the product, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again because while it may not be a miracle worker (what product is?), it seems to have some unexpected benefits that make my skin look better overall, and it is always on sale at the drugstore!</li>
    <li> After using Garnier Skin Renew for two months, applying everyday and sometimes twice, there is no change in my sun related dark spots on my face.  Not sure why I thought a drugstore product would take them away.  The smell is terrible and using it made my skin breakout with little red marks. Definitely a product long on promise and short on delivery.</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 of this product for my husband and I - been over three weeks to a month with every morning and every night and - results - none!!!! :(</li>
    <li> i love this idea every one wants to know where i got the&lt;br /&gt;love it  love love love this happy</li>
    <li> I bought this the other day to use in place of my vitamin C serum that I had ran out of and I love it. It&#x27;s cheap and I can see a noticeable change in how my skin looks. It has helped decrease the redness in my acne and I&#x27;m probably never going to switch back</li>
    <li> I hate it because it did not work but made my skin more oily and did nothing to improve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it to a person with acne.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working but I also use with the peel. Does not dry out the skin... and I do use it everyday, twice a day.</li>
    <li> Slow but it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;m a black male early 30&#x27;s who just starting getting black spots 2 years ago from wearing my ball cap in the Arizona sun. The sweat from the heat caused me to breakout and that caused my black spots. I have used this product for a month and a half now and have seen most of my dark spots fade and skin tone even out, but I still have sometime to go. I notice the difference in a week or so.</li>
    <li> I have dark skin and tend to scar pretty easily on my face.  Between acne and severe dry skin I have several scars on my face and neck.  I started using this product in hopes of seeing some difference.  After using the entire product I didn&#x27;t see any change and in fact my face was initially reacting to the product and was making my face sensitive to light. Will probably not try this again in the future.</li>
    <li> When I asked my aesthetician, who is an M.D., about how to get the dark spots off of my hands she recommended a pricey product.(&gt;100.00) I used it sparingly and there was a difference beginning to show. Now, this did not happen with one tube and the cost was becoming too much for me. So I decided to try Garnier Dark Spot correct for about $18 for a much larger tube. So I was able to slather on a coat morning and evening and after a couple of tubes the difference was truly starting to show. Then one day the store I purchased the Garnier was out, so I used Rite Aid brand. $5 cheaper and just as good if not better. I am currently using Walgreens band which was even cheaper still and I think this is the best of them all. But you have to be patient, it is not an overnight fix. But since I have to moisturize my hands every day any way why not kill two birds with one stone. By the way, I am a 57 year old man who in addition to bad sun damage, it even helps on the real dark spot. This is one time going generic will save you money and make your hands look younger,&lt;br /&gt;P.s.~ An occasional exfolient seems to help in conjunction with the product,</li>
    <li> ITEM IS NOT THE ONE SHOWED ON THE WEBSITE AND THE RECEIVD ITEM LOOKED LIKE TEN YEARS OLD ONE. But amazom did help me to resolve this issue, thanks.</li>
    <li> I love Garnier products.  They work and are reasonalbly priced. I use them along with a high end cosmetic line.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to diminish acne marks. When I applied it it burned like crazy! The burning sensation lasted over 3 hours. I will not purchase this product again. I even called the company to let them know.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about 3 years.  For my light skin it works great on sun spots.  I use it morning and night and have seen a big difference.  If you skip a couple days the spots seem to come back so the trick is be consistent with this product.  Also, try dabbing it on any age spots you may have on your hands.  It works there too!</li>
    <li> It is ok. 20% effective for removal of dark skin areas. Not what I expected from the reviews and use. Still 2 more weeks to go.&lt;br /&gt;I may not buy it again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as it states.</li>
    <li> I saw results in the first week great price and a amazing product I plan on keeping this as a #1 beauty aide item in my skincare collection</li>
    <li> Excellent product.I  Will get  some more when I used this up, Thank you so much</li>
    <li> I have tried the product but it hasn&#x27;t yet done what I was hoping for. I am still using the product on my legs which have major discoloration on them. The spots are fading but still too prominent for my liking.</li>
    <li> I bought the Dark Spot Corrector and the Dark Spot Overnight peel with high hopes of my dark spots fading. I did not think it would magically make them disappear. I used the products every day for months and it did absolutely nothing!!! They did not even fade a little bit!!! I would not buy this product.</li>
    <li> I developed dark spot on my face for a year now and looks disgusting ...i do get pimples if i use any kind of cream...my sister suggested me this one and tried...its worked like a magic ...90% of my spot are faded now....skins feels fresh n clear...</li>
    <li> this smells wonderful, it goes on light and does not feel oily or greasy. i use it mostly on my neck. its only been a few days so i will give another review....plus it shipped to my location in a matter of days.</li>
    <li> I purchased this the and the Garnier Skincare Skin Renew Clinical Dark Spot Overnight Peel and the Garnier Skin Naturals Light Whiten and Even Moisturizing Day Cream  use all three never saw a difference.  Seemed like a waste of my time.</li>
    <li> Quite pleasant to apply. Good moisturizer.  Haven&#x27;t obeserved any improvement of my skin tone yet when it was used alone.</li>
    <li> I used this faithfully, morning and night until the tube went dry...DRY!!!  I couldn&#x27;t squeeze another drop out of it..  And you know what?&lt;br /&gt;I see absolutly no difference at all.  NONE!!!!  I would clean my face, put on the Garnier, put on some moisturizer and then makeup.  At night it was the reverse and would always wear it to bed.  As a clean face, with Garneir Spot remover on it would work!!!  Isnt&#x27; that what they say???  HA.  I think NOT.  Good luck ladies.</li>
    <li> I used this product during 3 months, for this price this cream making a miracle but you must use it every day at least 2 times</li>
    <li> UPDATE- I have been using this for 3 weeks now and some of my dark spots have faded!!!! It seems to have no affect on my acne spots (didnt figure it would) but it did take away SOME of the dark spots i had from tanning!!!!! I have less \\&quot;freckles\\&quot; or what i thought were freckles but were just dark spots! I am very happy with my purchase and i will continue to keep using this! It makes my face so soft :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this recently because i have just about successfully cleared up my face from random acne outbreaks and i am now leftover with dark spots. Im 23 and just now figuring out what works for my skin. It is a long process!!!! My whole reasoning behind this purchase was wanting to be able to go make up less now that i dont have to cover up pimples. I have been using this product for about one week now. I use it when i wake up and when i go to sleep. I can already see a substantial difference in the appearance of my skin. My face seems to have a glow that i did not have before. It looks polished. This makes my face so smooth. I believe with continued use i will see some of these dark spots fade. My face soaks this product up, you def. still need to moisturize afterwards but it could just be my skin type. I am very fair colored and i have dry skin. It has not caused me acne outbreaks like other reviews stated. I will continue to use this product and hope for some more positive changes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually using a product that Amazon is out of or doesn&#x27;t carry right now..Their peel and to me it&#x27;s amazing..I have clear skin but started on some new meds that had me breaking out for about a month and left me with red marks..Bought Garnier&#x27;s dark spot overnight peel and after 3 days, their almost gone..I&#x27;m not kidding..maybe because the spots weren&#x27;t dark this product has worked so fast but it&#x27;s working for me and I will continue to use it..</li>
    <li> Hmm, OK I&#x27;m disappointed with the product I mean It faded the spots a little bit not that much. When I use nadinola it fades the spots quicker.</li>
    <li> Little more than a moisturizer, and that&#x27;s being generous.  Does NOTHING for dark spots, and neither does their Skin Renew Dark Spot corrector Peel. Have using both religiously for 2 months, no difference.  Fair skinned person.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is worth it. I didn&#x27;t see any change in my skin color. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Wow is all i can say, this product works best when used with Garnier Skincare Skin Renew Clinical Dark spot overnight Peel ! It really does work i have been using product for about a week and already could tell ta slight difference. It says results should be seen when using product for up to a month i believe. product is great and works well for my skin !!!</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical about this entire line at first. I really didn&#x27;t think my dark spots would lighten. They&#x27;re not severe but I have acne scars and this dark spot corrector really works to lighten them. I use it once daily, even though the directions say twice. I use it right after I shower/wash my face. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily at all. Great scent too. five stars!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I noticed a difference within the first few days, and it smells wonderful! Seriouly, buy it!</li>
    <li> I received this product on March 10 and have used it faithfully daily since. It doe snot reduce the brown spots at all and worse, it stains  the skin a deep orange in every area  it is applied and it is hard to wash off. I gave up putting it on my face because of this but daily awakened to orange dye covering my chest and arms. After six weeks of daily use, the only thing I have to show for it is a nasty orange/brown stain that has to be removed with plenty of soap and hot water. I would not endorse the product and will not buy it again. I should have known better. Even my dermatologist had given me a prescription product to remove these \\&quot;age spots\\&quot; and it was equally ineffective.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t see any result, however it does make my skin very smooth</li>
    <li> This cream turns yellow after you apply it.  And then it leaves yellow stains all over your pillow or sheet.  And worse, it is not very effective in removing dark spots.  I used two tubes and didn&#x27;t notice much of a reduction.  I then went to my dermatologist and he recommended something much more effective that comes from France.  And it wasn&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
    <li> Garnier Clinical Dark Spot Corrector states you should see a difference in dark spots in 8 weeks. I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully every day for at least 4 months, and it hasn&#x27;t made a bit of difference in any type of dark spot - whether it&#x27;s simple age spots as I get older, or where I mistakenly \\&quot;picked at\\&quot; pimples or blackheads when I was younger, or sun damage spots that have come up as I&#x27;ve aged, or tiny burn scars from a curling iron that aren&#x27;t bad, but I just wanted to fade them a little more - it hasn&#x27;t worked on any one kind of dark spot for me. Moving on to something else!</li>
    <li> It does not work!  What a false claim!</li>
    <li> I feel the need to chime in since I love this product and hope it sticks around. I normally check Amazon reviews before buying stuff like this, but I originally bought this on a whim at the store. I am so glad that I did! I use this product in conjunction with the overnight peel. Since using this product my face has been less oily and old acne scars have slowly begun to fade. It is not something that works overnight, but over the course of a month or two my skin has drastically improved. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past few years to fade dark spots and discolorations and it has always worked for me. I usually rub it in prior to putting on my moisturizer but lately I have been applying it to the dark spots and letting it sit for a few minutes while I get dressed. I have one particularly dark spot that has faded significantly in about a months time.</li>
    <li> Been using it over 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any changes. Makes my skin feel great so I&#x27;ll just give it more time. Delivery and service were excellent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many spot correctors and this one works just as good as the expensive department store brands (if not better).</li>
    <li> Used two tubes. Noticed no change.</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff for about 2-3 weeks now, skipped only a couple days but other than that everyday, thinly spread all over my face. And I am SHOCKED to see the results, all of my old acne marks and age spots I&#x27;ve accumulated over the past decade (especially during pregnancy) are all FINALLY FADING! I didn&#x27;t think this stuff would work (just had a coupon for it and decided to give it a try), and now I wished I had taken a \\&quot;before and after\\&quot; pictures to compare. I had some VERY noticeable dark spots on my forehead and top of the cheek bones and now even the dark ones are 75% faded. I also use Garnier&#x27;s facial scrub and their Ultra-lift Moisturizer as well as their makeup removing towelettes (this is the ONLY stuff I found that all doesn&#x27;t irritate my uber sensitive skin), but this stuff is amazing! I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see if it keeps working, it would be nice to see if it gets even better! Oh and since using this stuff my skin is also now a lot more even all over.</li>
    <li> Feels Great smells great. Need more time to see if it works great. Only had this about a month, I think my skin looks great and it feels great as well.</li>
    <li> I am noticing an improvement with the dark spots and softness of my skin! Will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks - I also started using it on my hands as I have age spots there as well.  I noticed the other day that my hands are actually lighter in color than my arms.. What I think this product is doing is basically bleaching skin.  It is not as noticeable on the face because we all wear make up after. Not sure I want my face much lighter than my neck!</li>
    <li> It works as it says. My wife made sure she had me look every week and i must say i did notice a difference. Great product.</li>
    <li> I bought from amazon.I just use it once and i got too many small small pimples...I had pimples before 2 years ago.I never had any pimple on face since last 2 years.Oh god i hate it.cant refer any friend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad bad bad bad</li>
    <li> This works better than the $50 clinic dark spot lightener. Works well.</li>
    <li> Ok, I have tried it all to help my dark spots......EVERYTHING, VERY EXPENSIVE, Prescription, everything, and this el&#x27;cheapo is the best hands down!! In a week I could tell a difference. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out like most do, it doesn&#x27;t make me peel or get chapped looking. Its straight up the best product Ive found. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using Garnier&#x27;s dark spot corrector for years. It&#x27;s a fantastic product. My skin is ultra sensitive. Dermatologists could not solve my pigmentation problem. This product reduces my pigmentation within 1 week of usage without causing any adverse effect. I have recommended it to my friends who have been very grateful to me for sharing such a wonderful cream with them.</li>
    <li> It did not work after months of using it every day.  I have decided to go to dermatologist to get a real product.</li>
    <li> Since I have been using this product, my skin has become softer and more clear. I use to have red patches on my cheeks and dark spots around my lips. I have noticed it has improved drastically since I have used it. Also, it smells amazing. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Some results but still have marks</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer--makes skin soft and supple. Product absorbs well into the skin--but if you have deep dark spots that have been on the skin awhile, this product takes forever to work--if at all.  I have been using this for about 7 months (purchased a two pack at Sams Club) and one tube is empty and no visible results.  l continue to use it for just a moisturizer--no great expectations for spot removal or &amp;#34;corrector&amp;#34; as labeled on the product.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any visible change after using this product.  Was hoping for more of a visible change.  Moisturized well however.</li>
    <li> I was truly hopeful about this product because it was so much less expensive than the other brands and I had read good things about it. For me, it has not reduced, or erased any of my dark spots. I have lots of little dark spots from recent breakouts and they are all still there. As a face lotion, it has a lovely smell and nice texture, but it does not do what it promises to do.</li>
    <li> Ive used it for a month....no results.....&lt;br /&gt;Will update in a few months....&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for a couple sun spots on my face....they are not so dark...or large....&lt;br /&gt;I havent noticed it lighten the few spots where i have picked at zits on my face either.&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered in a crushed box and the cap was cracked.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any break outs.....although...ive only used it on a few spots on my cheeks twice a day....I have not rubbed it in all over my face.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works or not</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very heavy on my skin...</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this product for a few weeks and i don&#x27;t see any difference in my dark spots. i probably would if i stay with it a few more weeks but judging but the other reviews, results would be subtle and i want them noticeably faded. perhaps it just doesn&#x27;t work for me but may work for you. I kinda don&#x27;t like that it leads my face slightly greasy either.</li>
    <li> Been using it twice a day, for 3 almost 4 weeks, and my dark spot is almost completely gone! I am satisfied with this product, this will work, it just takes a little bit of time</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would work.  I&#x27;ve tried other products, both more expensive and less expensive, with no results.  But I thought I would try Garnier&#x27;s Clinical Dark Spot Corrector Skin Renew product because the Garnier products I&#x27;ve used in the past were always decent and worked.  But after six weeks I am afraid this is another dark spot corrector to forget about.  Brown spots on face look no different what-so-ever.  Bummed!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer, when I use it consistently every night before bed, has helped me get the clearest skin I&#x27;ve ever had! Mind you, I say this with a grain of salt because it is also the first time I have actually been good about keeping a skin regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is on the oily side of normal, and I am only just finishing up with adolescent acne. I started using it about a year ago, but I tend to get off track after a couple of weeks. When I do use it consistently, I notice a difference in my skin starting the next day (looks fresher and clearer) and the spots from acne (which I get very easily because I have toffee-toned skin) clear up way faster than they would otherwise. Before I used this, when I got a spot after a pimple, it would last two or three months to clear up. With this they fade in a couple of days and disappear in two weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for something light to start up with/if you&#x27;re skin doesn&#x27;t need a lot of maintaining but you want to give it an extra boost. I&#x27;m not sure it would work very well for severe cases of acne scars, mine are pretty tame (though I get them easily).</li>
    <li> This product works very well in my opinion.  My overall complexion is more monochromatic now, and therefore wearing foundation is optional and I don&#x27;t need as much foundation now.  It worked pretty fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone said it gave them acne, but I haven&#x27;t had that experience (I would suggest that person give Saw Palmetto a try, since their acne may be related to their body converting some of their existing various hormones to DHT.  Saw Palmetto got rid of my adult acne completely BTW.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use the Garnier Fructis sun-repair and it worked well too, but this stuff seems to fade spots better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The laser photo facials are expensive and this is a good alternative.  TIP:  If you still want a Photo Facial (laser), look for a local asethetics school in your area (mostly large metro areas) for a huge discount on such services by learning students who are supervised by teachers during the processes.  Compare $400 per visit to $100 for an aesthetic school.  Be sure to follow the written discharge instructions regarding avoidance of exertion and the sun following your procedure(s), and use sunscreen on your face following your procedure.  I&#x27;ve had 2 photo facials and enjoyed them and the results, but I must say that this product almost makes such visits obsolete, and for only $14.  I think Wal-Mart sells this for just over $14 too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use of sunscreen on your face should help prevent re-currences of sun spots.  In other words, if you are using this product, but then going out every day back into the sun without sunscreen, you might not see much improvement because wherever you have sun spots they want to re-occur in that same spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP:  If you have a handful of really large, annoying, especially dark, poorly located age spots (as in right where you really don&#x27;t want them such as on the tip of your nose or the middle of your forehead or something), a pretty HARD CORE trick is to use Compound W (as in for warts).  It will literally eat the age spot off of your skin over night.  You can apply the Compound W and within an hour or two wash it off with water.  The next day there will probably be a scab that has formed.  The next day you can peel the scab that forms off and the age spot it gone.  USE EXTREME CAUTION, ESPECIALLY NEAR EYES OR MOUTH, YOU DON&#x27;T WANT TO GET ACID IN EITHER PLACE -- AND KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN AND PETS.  PUT THE CAP BACK ON IMMEDIATELY SO YOU DON&#x27;T SPILL THE BOTTLE BECAUSE IT WILL PROBABLY EAT RIGHT THROUGH THE TABLE!  The little brush that comes with the Compound W is perhaps too large for facial application for age spots, so you may want to use a TINY pinpoint makeup application brush (like for eyeliner) instead.  You only want to apply the Compound W exactly and precisely where the age spot is, not on peripheral tissue.  Also, for locations near the eyes or mouth, you may want to pre-dillute the Compound W with some water (50%/50% solution).  It may take two applications for it to work that way, but it&#x27;s worth proceeding cautiously.  And remember, the same concept applies for sun exposure:  even age spots removed with Compound W want to return to the same location with sun exposure, so use sunscreen after that.terally eat the age spot off of your skin over night.

    <li> Bought this and used it faithfully for two weeks. Absolutely no results with dark spots. Spend your money on a better product somewhere out there. Am still using the facial peel nightly, and it is gentle enough to put it on and go to bed. Garnier&#x27;s  peel product is doing \\&quot;something\\&quot; for my skin to make it look better, but not the Dark Spot Remover. Dark Spot Remover is a Great Moisturizer though it may cause breakouts for some. My suggestion is to market it that way.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product not really knowing how it would work on my arms and hands! You could play count the dots on them . .  .. I had so many and I am only fifty! It is not from sun damage either for I am not a sun worshiper. I always use sun protection when I am doing yard work. It is just rematurely brown spots from natural aging..  .  . .my mother had them young also! I was going to make an appt. with a dematologist to have them removed by laser or purchase a cream from the doctor but decide to try this first because the commericals were so convincing . .. . .  I really wasn&#x27;t expecting very much! It took about 3 months using twice a day but I noticed immmediatley after the first week of application that my brown spots were fading quickly.  .. it was very sudden how they faded, just amazing! As of today my arms and hands are free of any spots at all! I did see the reviews were not that great for the face but I only used it on my arms and top of hands and I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product! I did not use it on my face because I do not have any brown spots there but my arms and top of my hands. Hope you get the results I did ..  . . . Now my arms and hands match the rest of me, feeling lovely, youthfull again!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. .  .2 years later. I did not have permanent result. If I stop using this product the spots start to come back within weeks. It is a product that they need to continue using always!</li>
    <li> As ordered and quick arrival time, nice items and I would order this agian for sure. Well packaged as well!!</li>
    <li> The Garnier dark spot corrector isn&#x27;t an amazing product in a tube, but it has gained my respect simply because it works and has faded away dark spots from acne. It also has vitamin C which is very beneficial for the skin, read about it. Those of you out there looking for a miracle product in a tube won&#x27;t find it. If you really want substantial results go get laser surgery.</li>
    <li> It works very well it take a few weeks t see good results. Has a nice aroma. I RECEMENT IT</li>
    <li> arrived on time with 2 other products  have used b4  my 2nd tube and am still working on  getting rid of dark spots but they r starting to fade</li>
    <li> No change after 4 weeks of use 2x per day.</li>
    <li> it really doesn&#x27;t do anything for your skin but it smells nice.</li>
    <li> Pretty weak in effectiveness in correcting dark spots but is a great moisturizer--light, non-greasy, pleasant scent. My dermatologist told me that the only effective treatment for dark spots (such as from acne) are #1 TIME, #2 no sun exposure or strong sunscreen (the sun will stimulate the melanin production, a.k.a. dark spot, in even already faded spots), and #3 clinical strength topical medication--prescription for tretinoin cream which is the stronger version of what is in most &amp;#34;dark spot corrector&amp;#34; products.</li>
    <li> I have a small round slightly dark spot on my check and decided to use this product twice a day for three months but didn&#x27;t see any kind of improvement. I used the product all over my face but applied a second amount on the dark spot hoping to concentrate the area needed but didn&#x27;t see a difference. I won&#x27;t spend my money continuing this product.</li>
    <li> The product is veri good ,it did a good job on my face more than i expected.I have used different kinds of creams on my face but did not get any results,till i used garnier dark spot corrector and i love the good job it did on my face.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that it removed any dark spots but it smells really nice and my skin felt good after using it.</li>
    <li> Used about four tubes religiously before I gave up on using this product. Did not work in clearing spots.  Saw no result. Don&#x27;t  waste your money.</li>
    <li> I really like the results for this product, especially for the price.  I have seen results quickly.  I use it for some light acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives of the product...&lt;br /&gt;+ Acne heals better when I use this (redness goes away more quickly, heals better).  It does not \\&quot;treat the actual blemish...just what the blemish leaves behind.&lt;br /&gt;+ Reduces redness all over, improved skin tone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative&lt;br /&gt;- I am not thrilled about the smell.  It is something I can live with because I like the results but it smells to me like sunless tanning lotion.  I can usually smell it on my hands if I apply with my fingertips.  I choose to apply it with a cotton ball.  I don&#x27;t notice the smell then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give it 4 stars is due to the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second time purchasing this item and I will likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> It does not seem to be doing any correcting so far.  I have been using for over 2 weeks now.</li>
    <li> This actually made my skin darker in areas. I would NOT recommend this!!!</li>
    <li> wish it worked better but does make some improvement</li>
    <li> I usually like Garnier products.  Not this one.  I applied this regularly, morning and night and (don&#x27;t laugh - I really did this) took a picture once a week for eight weeks to see if anything changed.  Nothing.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but because of the way it&#x27;s advertised, I did expect something discernible.  Nope.  I tossed it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this as a moisturizer for about 2 months now and LOVE the way it makes my skin feel. I&#x27;ve had a few dark spots on either side of my nose and also my T-zone, which is has lightened dramatically, almost gone! I also have a larger dark spot above my lip and it lightened this somewhat but not as well as the rest of my face. It makes your skin very soft and smells great also!</li>
    <li> Applying actual freshly squeezed lemon juice to your dark spots would produce better results than the host of dark spot and fading products running rampant. Just use a cotton pad and apply the lemon juice 3-10 minutes prior to jumping into the shower (less or more time depending how sensitive you are to lemon juice.) It&#x27;s time consumers ask these companies to have 3rd parties test and validate their products claims prior to putting the products on the market. This one is definitely not worth mediocre results for 2x more (if you want an alternative and don&#x27;t like using real lemon juice).</li>
    <li> Purchased this product and used it for over 1 month (every day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was not happy with the results.  My dark spots never even faded.</li>
    <li> Nope ... hasn&#x27;t done a thing to &amp;#34;CORRECT&amp;#34; any of my dark spots on hands and face. Very disappointed in Garnier&#x27;s claim that it will help face spots.</li>
    <li> This product has completely transformed the texture of my skin! I had a lot of skin issues at the time - very dry, very flaky skin that was starting to show lines, and a lot of sun damage, including very large patches that covered most of my forehead. I started using this product along with the Garnier Skin Renew Overnight Peel. Within a couple of days my skins was no longer flaking, and my skins was incredibly smooth. I was able to stop using all the different layers of moisturizers. The texture of my skin was like it was before moving to a very dry climate, so I was (am!) beyond thrilled. My dark spots from sun damage are so much lighter that I once again feel confident with my skin. I cannot attest to how well this product would work by itself to reduce sun spots, as I did use it together with the overnight peel, but I am extremely happy with the results of both products used together.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 10 weeks now and I still have not seen any lightening of the dark spots on my face.  However, I will give it time to take effect, perhaps in another 2 months I might see some positive effect on my skin.</li>
    <li> I definitely notice an improvement after a few weeks, but there seems to be a limit as to how much of the skin spots are removed.</li>
    <li> MY SO USED IT TO REMOVE SOME DARK SPOT HE HAD ON HIS SKIN IT WORKED WELL HE HAS TRIED OTHE PRODUCT BUT THIS WORKED WELL</li>
    <li> I waited until my product was gone to write a review...which means I have been using it well over 6 months like recommended to see results......No results to be seen I am 29 and this product is over priced and did not reduce anything I use it 2x a day for almost a year. Do not waste your money. It is in peoples heads that say it works .I believe it is there way of convincing themselves of something.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference with this product but will continue with it but I won&#x27;t buy this one again</li>
    <li> I used this product for a YEAR and no results whatsoever.  From my experience, I say do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> Still lightened the skin around my dark spot :(&lt;br /&gt;Very slow, and my dark spots are still there.&lt;br /&gt;Now i have to go search for another product..........</li>
    <li> mid 30 asian female with acne/hyperpigment on the search for a solution. this prodcut does not work, a bit greasy, i have oily/combo skin didnt break me out but as far as dark spots, NO didnt do anything.</li>
    <li> I have just started using this product, the results are still pending.</li>
    <li> A large, sore bump left a dark spot over my left eyebrow. I began applying Garnier daily to that spot, and yes, in four weeks, it was fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product WORKS.</li>
    <li> This cream is great- its actually has real citric acid in it, which is a natural skin exfoliator/peel.  In fact, any of this cream that gets on the outside of the cap oxidizes and turns brown if it is the air for a while, since it contains genuine/natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this product. My dark spots are lighter and I suspect they will not totally go away. I was in the sun the other day and my spots darkened, however, after I was out of the sun a while, the spots were lighter. The smell of the product is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I used the lotion/cream in the morning upon waking &amp; at night before bed for 2 months...I have noticed NO change in the color of my age spots...would not recommend.</li>
    <li> The Garnier dark spot corrector did not work for me and I wish I would have got it from Walmart so I could get my $13 back.</li>
    <li> I used this for a few months and finally gave up on it. The product also seems to lose its potency faster than many other Vitamin C creams (and it has a residual smell that I can&#x27;t stand). You&#x27;re better off whipping up your own vitamin c cream with vit c powder and cold cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also.. if you really want to get rid of lines and age spots, try something with both retinol and vitamin c in it. I like the Afirm line. Its about double the price of this stuff.. but it works magic and maintains its potency.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have used several types of Vanishing creams and this product from Garnier seems to be working very nice. My face is very sensitive to moisturizers (I break out easily) and I am not having any issues with the Corrector Cream. I also use it on my chest area and hands. I will definitely keep using it.</li>
    <li> After looking at different skin products to get rid of a few dark spots, I decided on this one. Had a dark spot on my cheek. After about three weeks of regular use, I noticed the spot was lighter. Continued for another three and now it is gone. I have read other reviews where it didn&#x27;t work or was not a big improvement. It doesn&#x27;t work over night. I don&#x27;t thing any of the other products work real fast. I just know this one did for me.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin with age spots beginning to appear.  This lotion is the best product I have found for treating my skin. It lightens the spots to a level that makes them less noticeable (it will not eliminate them).  My skin is fair and almost translucent in some places above my eyes and on my hands.  I use this lotion on my hands, arms and face,  I have always had freckles, so the spots appear to be more like freckles when I use this lotion.  The lotion is not thick or greasy...it is very light and has a slight fragrance that dissipates quickly so there is no lasting odor.  Also, a little goes a long way!  The product arrived on time from the company.  The price is very reasonable from other skin treatments I have tried.  I would recommend Garnier Clinical Dark Spot Corrector to anyone, especially those with sensitive skin who would like to lighten and even out skin tone/complexion.</li>
    <li> This product was highly recommended to me with the assurance that it would definitely work.  I used this product for maybe two weeks (if so long), but by the end of that time, I just threw the product away. I did not see a difference in the spots on my face, but I did feel a difference every time I used this product. The first time I used it, there was a slight tingling on my skin, which was fine. Each additional time I used  the product, my skin would \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; a bit more. I tried to ignore it, but by the end of the two weeks, it felt like my face was on fire. I immediately had to wash it off. I also noticed (the last time), that there were slight bumps on my skin from the serum. They went down about fifteen minutes after I washed my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be possible that this product may have worked eventually on the dark spots on my skin, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to continue using it. I would recommend that if you have sensitive skin, you should be very careful with this product.</li>
    <li> It work, but it takes time.  I am on my third tube. I did have a couple of real dark spots on my cheek, one is almost gone and the other is a lot lighter.My skin is overall more even.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I always liked and bought Garnier products when I was still in our country in Asia. They sold more choices for Garnier products which are not sold here in the USA. However, this item I just tried it and I think it&#x27;s working like other Garnier products. It&#x27;s good for my skin which is not so oily and not so dry. Garnier whitening products usually reduce small pimples in my face and dark spots if applied daily. Also, I find it cheaper to buy it here than in stores.</li>
    <li> it feels great on skin and smells really nice too. not so sure about color correction tho.</li>
    <li> I used this product as directed but my dark areas were not as light as I would have hoped for.  I wondered if  the condition of your skin could be the reason this would happen.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. I have been using but the product does not work. My skin is the same as before.</li>
    <li> I feel like the product is noticably changing my skin. I have received compliments. I use it treat my severe dark spots and scars from my acne. I only recommend the Garnier Clinical Dark Spot Corrector WITH Garnier&#x27;s Over Night Peel AND WITH your shade of Garnier BB Cream. If you use the entire system it works better.</li>
    <li> Ok. Let me start by saying that if you want instant results, you should find another product. I have been using Garnier Clinical Dark Spot Corrector for 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m already seeing improvement. As my title states, I am a black woman with the common issue of hyper pigmentation. At 25 years old I&#x27;m running out of patience and money to correct the issues teenage acne has left me with. The Garnier product is the best thing I have tried yet (and yes, I&#x27;m including \\&quot;the all too coveted proactive\\&quot; to this list). After your morning wash, apply the product over the spots and THEN apply sunblock before leaving the house. I&#x27;m very pleased with my once a day treatment and results I have seen in only three weeks compared to any other product. An added bonus is that it&#x27;s not heavy or oily. The BEST  PART FOR BLACK WOMEN is that the product has changed my skin color overall. What I&#x27;m saying is that my natural skin does not look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup on my face that&#x27;s two shades lighter than my neck lol! For $15, I&#x27;m very pleased and anxious to try other Garnier Facial Products. If I was tech savvy I would put up a before and after photo but I&#x27;m not that crafty with technology... I hope it works for you!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about 2-3wks ago and at the begininng I was pleased.  Pleased that the fact when I applied it at night, in the morning my face felt soft.  However as time went on (maybe a two days after use), in the mornings my face began to feel sticky.  When I would lay down on my pillow, my face would actually stick to my pillow. In addition to that I hated the fragrance, not the smell because it smelled wonderful, but the fact there was fragrance in the product.  I absolutely hate products that are for the face containg fragrance.  In my opinion, anything that is applied to the face should not have fragrance because the face is a sensative area.  I see no need for my face to smell good.  Anyway, moving on after about a week or two in, my face began to break out horribly.  I do have sensative skin and most things make me breakout but my god the bumps that this product produced were horrible cystic (huge pimples) acne.  I usually don&#x27;t get bumps that big.  It was horrible.  More bumps &#x3D; more ance scars which defeats the purpose the the product all together.  I&#x27;m trying to get rid of scars not add more and that is was it did.  Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t give an review on the fading spots aspect because I discontinued use and didn&#x27;t use it long enough to notice.</li>
    <li> I wanted so bad to like this product... but it&#x27;s awful! The first day I used it, it burned like a wildfire and caused me to break out. The next day I used it (less of it- put on thinner) I broke out in mini hives all over my face and neck! The overnight peel they recommend you use with it did NOT break me out... in fact it was making my complexion more even until I tried the clinical lotion. It&#x27;s not oil free and if you have sensitive skin, run FAR away from this product and save your skin, sanity and your $$$ because it isn&#x27;t cheap!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several months now and my skin is still the same spotted leopard. Wasted money!</li>
    <li> i dont know&lt;br /&gt;it almost seems like its a mild type of dye&lt;br /&gt;i have seen over flow that has dried on the outside of the tube&lt;br /&gt;it looks brownish&lt;br /&gt;perhaps to dye my face the color of my spots.....</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; but this one really worked for me. I am a senior citizen and of course all the sunbathing I did as a teen and onwards has done a number on my skin now. I would caution all you who tan to not do it as one day your face will have age spots and if you are unlucky find out like I did you also have skin cancer. But I digress! I have several age spots and while they haven&#x27;t disappeared they have faded quite a bit so if I wear just a little foundation you don&#x27;t even notice them. I also think it&#x27;s helping my wrinkles believe it or not. Anyway I will continue to use this and just got the peel so we&#x27;ll see how that works out with this.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help minimize a few dark spots on my face from using birth control pills.  After more than a month of using morning and night, there has been no difference to them at all.  The gel did help my face feel hydrated, but other than that, nothing else.</li>
    <li> Sorry, but this product is not good in removing spots or lightening them, takes 12 weeks to see even the slightest change.</li>
    <li> feels nice on my skin</li>
    <li> OMG. Finally i found this product. i&#x27;ve never wrote a review but i have to say this REALLY WORKS. i cant believe how this changed my skin, i was desperate at the beginning but when i kept on the schedule i started to see the progress, this cream gave me something i was looking 4 for seven years.</li>
    <li> Not great for problem skin.  Helps with the spots on hands but not for comedone-prone skin.</li>
    <li> I guess these skin care products were just not meant for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have acne marks and scars. I was hoping this would clear it up. Well... It did the complete opposite. I was breaking out like crazy for some reason. And because of it, I have even more acne marks (I do have a nasty habit I finally stopped doing of picking). I lost a job promotion TWICE because my ex-boss was picky on having a clear and clean face for the position, and thanks to this, I FAILED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the tube was empty and gone, I stopped using it and my skin cleared up. I switched to Simple, my face cleared up even more, my acne marks are going away now, and I got the job promotion with my new boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garnier. Stop selling this worthless product and thanks for making me look miserable at work because of this. Ladies, don&#x27;t even bother using it, especially with oily/somewhat sensitive skin. Save your money and get something else.</li>
    <li> I am a little more than half way through my tube of the dark spot corrector and have been using it for about 6 weeks. I guess you have to use it longer or buy another tube because, so far, my spots are still as visible as they were before I started using it. I am not surprised because several weeks before I bought it, I read where a dermatologist stated that NOTHING removes age spots. I guess I was hoping that Garnier&#x27;s claims would prove the dermatologist wrong-- Nope! I&#x27;ll use it to the end of the tube but I will not buy another one. I&#x27;m moving on to apple cider vinegar. (still trying to prove the doc wrong)</li>
    <li> In conjunction with the chemical peel this almost erases your dark spots this is my second tube and i just love this</li>
    <li> Dark spots are less prominent, but not completely gone. Still have to cover them with a bit more make-up. (Used morning and night.)</li>
    <li> I am 60, so the spots I have are not only from the aging process, but also due to the fact I was a boater my whole life. My spots are definitely fading, but I also take other preventative measures to prevent more. Along with this product, I also slather sunscreen on my entire body every day. Due to medications I&#x27;m on, I am unable to lay out in the sun like I&#x27;ve enjoyed doing my whole life, but I believe it&#x27;s a blessing in disguise. You can&#x27;t expect a product to perform miracles if you aren&#x27;t proactive in the care of your skin. I&#x27;ve hesitated to expose my legs in shorts, skirts, etc. because of the spots on my legs. But I wish I could buy this product in bulk, because I&#x27;m now using it on my legs and I&#x27;m seeing significant fading of the spots (have used for about two weeks). Also use it on the back of my hands. If you younger gals are choosing to lay in the sun, and wondering why this product isn&#x27;t working, well, I can&#x27;t help you there. There are organic tanning salons and lotions you can use to create a tan without the damaging effects of the sun. I&#x27;m living proof. But I give this product a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Update: Done with the tube. My review still stands. It helped me. It did reduce my spots. However, the results I got by the end of the first week were the only results. Nothing got better than that. I&#x27;m not thrilled, but hey, at least it worked a little. I won&#x27;t repurchase. Oh, and as other reviewers mentioned, it does stain clothes. All my pajamas and pillow cases have bleached spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product. It helped me. However, the whole magical, night-and-day difference as advertised by Garnier simply isn&#x27;t true, at least not in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll preface this by saying my dark spots were caused by an intense breakout covering patches of my face for about six months. I figured out how to treat the root cause through diet, water guzzling, decreasing stress, and seeing my doctor about a hormonal imbalance. I couldn&#x27;t even begin to use this product until my breakouts were completely eliminated, and new ones had stop forming. My breakouts were a relatively short-term issue, which left me with noticeable but not time-worn dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, here is what the product has done for me. It did reduce my acne spots, but it did not eliminate them. The dark spots went from a deep bruise color to a light brown, reminiscent of freckles, though the clustered placement of them look far from natural. Before, I couldn&#x27;t hide the dark spots without breaking out a tattoo cover-up concealer. Now, I can cover them for the most part with a light-to-medium coverage foundation. I can even wear a tinted moisturizer over the entire face, then spot correct with a regular concealer to cover the frecklie-looking acne spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this product helped me because I waited to see if the acne spots would start to diminish on their own, once the breakouts had gone. They did not change. Within two days of starting the Garnier, I started noticing a difference. The progress leveled off after a week, and it has been holding steady. There have been some unexpected other benefits, though. My skin tone has evened out, it looks brighter, and my skin feels smoother and softer. Trust me, it was a horrible patchy mess for six months, and I thought it would take much longer to bounce back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest con I can see with this product, aside from the ridiculous miracle-esque claims of the advertising, is that it does burn any raw areas. For example, the skin around my mouth has become very sensitive and easily irritated. Even on a supposedly normal day, this product burns the skin around my mouth, leaving me with an obvious and inflamed patchiness. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t attempt to use this while any fresh breakouts were present, because I&#x27;m sure it would have burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am generally pleased with this product. I am still on my first tube, and I am on the fence about repurchasing. If it were still making a difference in the appearance of my spots, I would definitely repurchase. However, I am starting to think the first week&#x27;s rapid and effective lightening is the best this product can offer. If that is the case, I don&#x27;t see the point in making this a regular part of my skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star for the burning issue, and another for the fact that the results have not been nearly as fantastic as the company claimed. If it doesn&#x27;t do wonders on someone like me, with a recent and relatively mild case of acne dark spots, I don&#x27;t see how this could do much for someone with more serious or long-term issues. I feel comfortable recommending this to someone wanting to see a little improvement, but I certainly don&#x27;t rave about this and stick it in all my friends&#x27; gift bags.ed other benefits, though.

    <li> I have used almost an entire tube and it hasn&#x27;t made a difference at all. I won&#x27;t buy it again and wouldn&#x27;t recommend that anyone try it. Waste of $$.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my girlfriend.  She was skeptical because of the poor reviews but made me purchase this anyway (and who the heck am I to say no???).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far (3 weeks) she really likes this product.  She has asked me many times if it has &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; the &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; to which I have always replied &amp;#34;never noticed any spots&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;oh yeah that looks great, I can barely see anything&amp;#34;.  Not lying, I really have never noticed hat she is talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this works or not to be honest but I can tell you this; it makes my girlfriend happy and that is all I care about.  Us dudes don&#x27;t notice these &amp;#34;dark spots&amp;#34; that all you ladies think you have.  After you use this does it make a difference? Maybe.  I&#x27;ll tell you it does every time you ask though.  In the end, if you feel better about yourself and are more confident, then that is all that matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had acne scars along my jaw bone that I wanted to get rid of. I read the reviews and thoughout I would take a chance. I used this product for about 10 days only at night and there was no difference in the scar but more acne! I even started to develop cystic acne there! When you put this on, it does tingle a little and smells great so you are under the impression that it is doing wonders for your skin. Well it did not do the trick for me. I stopped using it all together and the acne got better but I still had this huge bumps under my skin with no white head so I couldn&#x27;t pop them I just had to deal with it. I stopped using it for a couple of weeks, then decided to try it again for a spot I had on my forehead. Within a couple of days I did notice a difference. That is the only spot that I use it on and have not touched my cheeks with it since the break out. I did some research and leared that a lot of skin lightening or brightening creams and things have large amounts of vitamin c in them. On one site I saw that I could give myself lemon facials a couple days a week and I would notice a difference. With that, I literally cut a lemon in half, rub it all on my face, let it sit for about 15 minutes, rinse off and then mosturizer. Works like a gem. I recommend this on spot, not large areas of your face at all.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product, I had in mind a better look for my face.  I have used the product about two weeks, and the dark spots I was particularly concerned with--three of them on my right cheek--are now several shades darker, went from brown to black.  I was shocked, and trying to find out the stages these spots go through using this product.  I&#x27;m hoping this is only an early stage, because my face certinly looks horrible now.  I use concealer, but I could have covered the spots up better before I used the Dark Spot Corrector.  Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I used the moisturizer and the overnight treatment over the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea if these products gets rid of dark spots...I had to stop using it, because it made me break out like a sitcom teenager on prom night. I rarely write reviews but I genuinely feel that this product needs to be recalled.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the grocery store thinking that this would help with some of my age spots. It seemed to be working until I noticed that my foundation was too light. I stopped using the product and withing a week and a half, the spots were back, and my skin was starting to get lighter. I threw out the tube! I cannot believe that Garnier claims this product breaks up dark spots! It does no such thing.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Clinical Dark Spot Corrector in conjunction with the Skin Renew Clinical Dark Spot Overnight Peel.  The reason why I purchased this product is because I has bought the Clinique version of the product a year ago and I loved it.  It is very expensive and I was looking to see what Garnier provided with a smaller hit to my pocketbook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few people started to mention that my skin looked really good after about 2 1/2 - 3 weeks of use.  I have noticed fading to dark spots and an overall better tone to my skin.  I can&#x27;t say that it worked as rapidly or quite as well as the Clinique but I found the results to be worthwhile and fit the price point of the product.</li>
    <li> This sounded like a great product. I don&#x27;t know if it works because after ruining 3 articles of clothing/bedding I quit using it. Since it doesn&#x27;t have SPF, I used it at night. I noticed that it made my face stick a little bit to the pillow. What I didn&#x27;t realize at first was that it was getting on my pillow case and pajamas, and that it wouldn&#x27;t come out. The best case was my white pillow case. After completely saturating it with Shout and washing with bleach and some laundry booster (Borax), most of the orange/tan color came out. My white sleep T-shirt has stains around the neck line after washing despite pre-treating with both Dawn (because I thought the stain was foundation) and Tide pre-treat. The worst was my lavender pajamas that I forgot to pre-treat before washing. They came out with medium brown stains all around the neck line. I had used the product on my neck as well as face - huge mistake. Disappointed doesn&#x27;t even describe my feelings at the moment. . . . I can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re selling something this damaging without mentioning that you should avoid getting it on fabric.</li>
    <li> Been using since September. Nothing has changed. The skin on my face can be sensitive and the only good thing I can say about this product is that it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month now. I have noticed my dark spots fade significantly and I&#x27;ve had almost no ingrown hairs since using this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion morning and night for about three week. I had dark spots on my cheeks, nose, and upper lip. The spots on my cheeks and nose have been significantly reduced, but the one on my lip is still lingering. Although I can not tell whether it has decreased in darkness (probably thanks to the summer sun as well), I love the way my skin feels after using this lotion.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely terrible. I couldn&#x27;t even tell you if it actually works to correct dark spots because I had to stop using it after three days because it made me break out so terribly. Starting this product was the only change I made in my skincare routine, so I know this product was the culprit. Also, it has a horrible smell. I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I think is is false advertising, it does not correct dark spots, should be more specific that it will not clear on all skin types</li>
    <li> It works!! Most of the whitening products makes skin dry out but this product not. I use it every night.</li>
    <li> i had horrible acne scars on my chin and this erased them within 4 weeks!! i have had more reappear so bought this again becasue of how well it worked the first time :)</li>
    <li> I have dark spots from acne on both cheeks and I bought this to try to at least make them less noticable, if not get rid of some of the spots completly. My spots aren&#x27;t even that bad and this lotion did absolutely nothing for them. It was a great face lotion, it&#x27;s light and smells nice but that&#x27;s about it. I used it twice a day for over 2 moths and saw no change. So dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Thiws truly helps fade your age spots on face.</li>
    <li> Has a really lovely tangy fragrance. Dries easily and fast.Don&#x27;t know how effective it is as I wear it under my makeup and I use it alongside the peel. Guess they work best together!</li>
    <li> I bought a tube of this stuff.  Apparently, you have to clip off the end of the tube to  open it, even though the tube looks open already.  I figured I&#x27;d just squeeze harder to get it to come out.  Oh, it came out, all right--the end of the tube opened up and spewed product all over my bathroom counter!  I was in a hurry, so I figured I&#x27;d clean it up (and return the now-nearly-empty tube) later.  When I did, a couple of hours later, *it took the finish off my stone bathroom tile!*  What was once a nice, shiny tile is now a dull blotch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let&#x27;s think about this.  I&#x27;m supposed to put this on my skin?</li>
    <li> Item may be good at reducing age spots but did not use because of perfume scent.&lt;br /&gt;I use Garnier shampoos and hair colors and find those scents OK and the products&lt;br /&gt;very good so didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d run into any problem.</li>
    <li> Works better than I expected!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product-doesn&#x27;t remove dark spots but makes your skin softer and brighter with continuous use</li>
    <li> after a month, I don&#x27;t see a great difference in my spots, very marginal, will keep using but not too optimistic</li>
    <li> Looked all over for this product and there it was on amazon.The price was great and it feels great .I will have to see now if it does the job on all those dark spots.</li>
    <li> While I would love to review the effectiveness of the product, I can&#x27;t.  The fragrance is way too overpowering for me to continue using.  I am on my 3rd day and I am done.  I am looking for a new product for this issue.</li>
    <li> I am 60+ and have problems with age spots and life long moderate Roscea. This product has smoothed out bumpiness and faded the age spots almost entirely, without any irritation. I am on my third tube!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m of mixed african american descent and my skin seems to suffer from hyper pigmentation where even a mosquito bite will leave a dark mark for months. I&#x27;ve used this product for several months- just applying after every face wash and I&#x27;ve really seen an improvement. It doesn&#x27;t work on serious scars, but it really speeds along zit-mark healing and fading. I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of other products, but I was surprised at how long my tube lasted and how well it worked. It&#x27;s been the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried, also, as far as not just making me break out more. It always leaves my skin feeling soft! I just bought it again.</li>
    <li> this cream was ordered because I have really bad dark spots on my face, but I went outside after putting this on my face, and it cooked my face, it could have been my skin, I don&#x27;t know, thank you amazon!</li>
    <li> I like it &amp; it smells wonderful</li>
    <li> This does seem to be blurring my discolorations on my face. As with anything it needs time. Does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other products/home remedies for dark spot removal, so I was skeptical when I first got this. After the week or two I&#x27;ve been using it, usually every to every other day, my dark spots have gone from noticeable dark scars to nearly nothing at all. Honestly the best product I&#x27;ve used, but with one downside, the packaging. If the tube gets dented or squeezed even slightly while the cap is on a bunch of the product will come flowing out because the tube doesn&#x27;t bounce back to it&#x27;s normal shape like a normal tube or even a toothpaste tube. As long as it&#x27;s kept in a spot where that won&#x27;t happen the product is well worth the bad packaging.</li>
    <li> Have to admit I havn&#x27;t seen any difference or improvement in my dark spots fading or disappearing. Kind of disappointed but will keep searching and trying different products.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for one little red spot that was really driving me crazy.  It was on my upper abdomen and about the size of a fingertip.  It was really red and I don&#x27;t know where it came from, all I know is I wanted it gone.  I had tried one other product before this (a certain natural product originally from Maine with the initials BB) and it did absolutely nothing. So I almost gave up but decided to try this and give it a shot.  I got it in a kit with the peel mask so I used this every morning and the mask at night.  I have to say, around the 2nd or 3rd week I was having trouble even finding the spot to put it on, that&#x27;s how fast and effective it was.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the texture of the mask because I thought it would harden overnight and I&#x27;d peel it off in the morning, but it didn&#x27;t do that, it was just another cream only runnier than this one. But I think using them in conjunction may have helped.  I was actually very pleasantly surprised by this product because I have tried other Garnier products (their hair color in particular) and found them completely ineffective, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I am happy to say it proved me wrong.</li>
    <li> Great results on any skin tone.  Light enough to be worn under your makeup and it smells great.  Another hit product from Garnier.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about three weeks, My dark spots have faded, but are still there.  But I can see the difference and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I like this product, though somewhat disappointed in the results.  I had great hopes my dark spots would erase or lighten considerably, they are lighter, just still very present.  I&#x27;m moving on to another popular one to see if it works better.</li>
    <li> This is one time were the \\&quot;suggested to use in combination with X (another product the company is pushing)\\&quot; seems to actually enhance the original product. When used with Garnier Skin Renew Clinical Dark Spot Peel the Dark Spot Corrector works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had several black spots on my cheek that had been there for months. They were the worst I had ever had and weren&#x27;t fading. I was tried for caking on the makeup so I started looking for a solution. I have oily skin and have to be careful to not select produces that will add to the issue. I check at Macy&#x27;s and their products were a little to expensive for me to gamble on them working, so I was delighted to find this cheaper option. I used as directed, in addition to the Peel, and within 3 week the spots were completely gone. Some have comment on the length of time it took to get results, but with realistic expectations (don&#x27;t expect a next day transformation) you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have dark spots, but I use this as an every day moisturizer. It is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This was not a good product and I was very disappointed. It did not work at all. Had to go back to porcelaina</li>
    <li> I used this cream for now two months every morning and every evening on my face and neck. I do live in Florida and some small darker freckles did appear on my face and neck so I was hoping to get rid of it. This cream simply does not work!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has changed, my dark spots are as dark as they were two months ago! :(&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed I am looking foe another product now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used clinque spot remover but it&#x27;s kinda pricey so I thought I&#x27;d try garnier.  Now I know why clinque was more expensive, it actually worked.  I&#x27;ve seen no results with garnier.  Perhaps it may work with different types of skin.  I&#x27;m olive complected, tan easily and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work because it&#x27;s a good line; however, I&#x27;ve seen no difference after 4 weeks of use. I&#x27;m fair skinned and had some sun spots darkened by self-tanner from this summer. What really bums me out is that this product cannot be worn under make-up because it pills, making me look like my skin is peeling.</li>
    <li> Good one i recommend to all</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this cream but I am so happy that I did. The dark spots on my face did not disappear completely (but I never thought they would). They did however drastically lighten. It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, your spots won&#x27;t completely disappear but I am so happy with how much they have lightened. I never expected to see this much of a difference and I am not even close to&lt;br /&gt;finishing the tube yet. For the price, give it a try!</li>
    <li> Used for 2 weeks so far twice a day with using the nighttime peel.  I can definitely see the difference all though not gone, but they have been there for 20 or so years.  Cheaper at Wal Mart though.</li>
    <li> works slower than promised but it does work</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Clinique and Murad for dark spots.  The Murad would help when applying it at night but then it the morning the spots would magically appear again.  Clinique was okay but really expensive. I saw an ad for this and thought hmm, Garnier, really, aren&#x27;t they for hair products? Never was impressed with the shampoo but for the price I thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl. I used it last night, I dabbed a little more on the spots.  I have 2 heavily dark spots on my cheeks.  Today, I can barely see them, even as my make up is wearing off, I don&#x27;t have to apply any concealer to hide them.  Awesome product and for the price, I am amazed.</li>
    <li> This item really works.  My sister used this item first and I seen her results totally gone after 3 months of continue use.  I&#x27;m just about finish with my first month and my spots have really change.  Not totatly gone but I can see it working. I give it four stars because there is no warning of not to use it if the wound is open.  It will burn something terrible and make it worse.  So if you have a fresh scar let it close and heal before you use this product.</li>
    <li> I like the way it minimizes acne scars and brightens skintone, which is what its intended to do. However, after about 20 minutes after application it starts to smell like sunless tanning lotion! I even tried combining it with my uv moisturizer to minimize the smell but it is still noticeable. I would advise wearing it to bed overnight and not on a good pillowcase....just in case. Mine hasn&#x27;t stained but it does get dark on the bottles tip which shows it could.</li>
    <li> It does work.I have some horrible spots from acne. And it diminished my spots around my noise and my jaw line area. It better to be used at night,I ain&#x27;t sure about using it during day time because of it consistency. But what I can say is,I was using the Garnier dark spot remover in a different lid than this. When I go back to the store to get another tub,They didn&#x27;t have the one I was used to. But this one works too,you just need to give it a time. Like a month or two.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, but I never saw any changes.  And it seemed no matter if I used the smallest amount possible it made my face very greasy &amp; oily looking.  It smells very good, but that&#x27;s about it.  After buying this product &amp; now regretting it, I know I will have to resort to something else.  Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did!</li>
    <li> I have used it for the last several months and it does not work like they advertised.  I ended up throwing it away, what a waste.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, It makes my skin feel so hydrated. I like to use it at night before bed and my face looks brighter by morning, Im not saying spots are faded in one use but I can say you will probably see a difference in your skin tone the next morning.  Ive used a full tube and and  I&#x27;m here ordering a second one. Some reviewers are saying theres a strong  scent and there is but its not perfumy or offensive, its a strong citrus smell thats pleasant..to me it smells really clean. It has a lot of vitamin c and really helps with cell regeneration. When I wear it to bed and I wake up in the morning my skin is almost more plump,very hydrated, and smooth.  It has so much Vit C in fact you shouldn&#x27;t wear it alone in the sun.  Your skin is more prone to burning.  I always use an SPF anyway so it wasn&#x27;t an issue for me.  After almost 3 months use with one tube I have noticed a huge difference in my skin tone and acne scarring starting to fade and disperse.  I would recommend this to anyone who has hyper pigmentation or even just really dry skin and fine lines.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it since I bought it and the effects have not been very good. Noto clarifying all round the spot, but the black dots are equal.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have too much expectation for this to work because it is one of the cheaper products on the shelf.  And I was right.  I applied it daily and nothing happened.  My dark spots from acne didn&#x27;t lighten at all.  Plus, I hate the smell.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product! It doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> feels nice,smells well but didn&#x27;t vanished ANY spots!. I used once a day before going to bed, maybe is intended to be used twice.I finished the product, and nothing changed.</li>
    <li> been using it for a few months and no change in my dark spots at all. do not buy this item</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for my oily skin. Absorbs quickly and does not apply extra grease to my skin keeping it soft. Unfortunately, this cream FAILS miserably at removing dark spots. It got rid of not even ONE spot. Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this product for some acne scarring on my face. I saw a difference in the first week. I have very oily skin but I can use this under foundation without my skin feeling gross.</li>
    <li> I think I had been expecting too much from an over-the-counter (OTC) product. I echo the 2 most helpful reviews of this product: it does help your skin (I noticed a disappearance of forehead wrinkles and a tightening and resurfacing of skin in general); it does not erase dark spots miraculously in 1, 2 or 6 weeks. After looking at all the dark spot corrector product reviews, it seems no OTC will do that.  Deeper spots may need laser, peels, or time plus hormone correction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If dark spots are due to hormones, then they&#x27;ll keep coming back until the hormone issue is resolved. I suffer from 2 different spot-causers: 1) post inflammatory hyper pigmentation from a bad acne breakout almost a year ago and 2) I have 1 large spot from the birth control pill that has come and gone with hormone fluctuations over the past 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The hormone spot gets darker then lighter, darker then lighter, regardless of products, time, etc. Even if I were to bleach this spot or peel it, it will come back until I&#x27;m off the pill and my hormones are properly and naturally regulated.&lt;br /&gt;-The acne spots have faded, and various things helped - not exfoliating regularly but being gentle on my skin (no more trauma to the skin), moisturizing, and using a high SPF (50) sunblock.  I also use DermaBlend concealing foundation to cover my spots, and I can&#x27;t recommend that enough for making it easy to wait the healing process out, while my doctor and I figure out the hormonal balance to keep my skin and me healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I see \\&quot;dark spot correcting,\\&quot; on any product, I know not to expect it to help fade dark spots, but I do expect it to help my skin in some ways, and this product does improve my skin noticeably. I will purchase another tube.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about 6-8 weeks now and my dark spots might have dimmed a bit, but are nowhere near gone. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
