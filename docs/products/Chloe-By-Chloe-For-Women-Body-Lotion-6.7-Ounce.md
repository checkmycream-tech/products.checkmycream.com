      <li>I&#x27;m so glad Amazon can alert me when a store has it in stock.  </li>

      <li>So I knew I would love this lotion</li>
      <li>It is creamy and silky and I love the scent.</li>

      <li>I was excited to find the body lotion because I love Chloe perfume.</li>
      <li>Easy to wear just about anywhere.</li>
      <li>Enjoy.</li>
      <li>I am not a huge perfume person and this works great for me to use a lotion that leaves a nice scent.  </li>
      <li>Chloe has a wonderful, elegant fragrance and when applied goes on smoothly leaving you with a day long feeling of \\&quot;being finished\\&quot;, complete!</li>
      <li>I love it, it goes right into your skin and smells gut</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and absorbs quickly without feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>It smells like the original Chanel.</li>
      <li>As a lotion it is light and fresh.  </li>
      <li>so much I needed to have more</li>
      <li>I need to be able to purchase the powder at a reasonable rate.</li>
      <li>It goes well with my body chemistry and the price I paid for the lotion was not bad.</li>
      <li>This is just a lovely classic fragrance.  </li>
      <li>This body lotion is not very easy to find but I can always find it at a great price here.  </li>
      <li>It was very liquid and smell like cheap avon creams but nothing like the Chloe scent.</li>
      <li>as far as i know she is pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>the person who received the gift said thank you very much.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I threw it away after the first use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not used another fragrance since I first tried Chloe.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon Prime!</li>
      <li>it was sooo hot</li>
      <li>I cant really wear the lotion and perfume together.</li>
      <li>I really like Chloe&#x27;s scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my absolute fave scent.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t the same as the original.</li>
      <li>Not the Chloe it used to be but closer to the real thing than that new Chloe that they are selling..</li>
      <li>Whether I use the product in six months or two years, it still has the same fresh smell.  </li>
      <li>I prefer my scents to be more subtle, and this lotion is pretty in-your-face about its flower power.</li>
      <li>Wife loves it, but this is not the New Chloe</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this lotion is new</li>
      <li>The Cloe Body Lotion must have been very old because the perfumed scent that is so&lt;br /&gt;appealing</li>
      <li>the order process was smooth and although the estimated possible delivery dates extended past christmas, the product arrived with several days to spare.</li>
      <li>I have used the other Chloe products but the lotion creates a soft floral fragrance all over and makes me feel soft and feminine.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s not a strong type of perfume and you don&#x27;t have to use very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Definitely does not smell like I expected, very different than the Chloe perfume scent</li>
<li> Have been using it for a long time.  </li>
<li> I have been paying 3 times as much for Chloe lotion at other sites the past few years.  </li>
<li> I receive compliments constantly when I use this fragrant lotion - hot weather, cold weather, any time I wear it.</li>
<li> It is soft, and subtle.</li>
<li> I agree with one of the other reviewers that the fragrance can be over-powering.  </li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t smell like Chloe usually does, had a very heavy smell, like a perfume that was a few years old.</li>
<li> /&gt;Beware of the imitation product!  </li>
<li> I bought this product for my mother a few years ago and she just loves it.  </li>
<li> I wear it everyday.</li>
<li> awful and cheap smell!</li>
<li> I have been wearing Chloe lotion and Chloe perfume for the past 25 years.  </li>
<li> I would be very skeptical about ordering any other perfumes or&lt;br /&gt;cosmetics on line in the future.</li>
<li> MY COUSIN LOVES CHLOE AND IT IS GETTING HARD TO FIND.  </li>
<li> This item is getting hard to find.</li>
<li> Very disappointing paying more than $15 for something that smells this bad.</li>
<li> When she runs out of the lotion it is very hard to find it again.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using &amp;#34;Chloe&amp;#34; for many years and just love it.  It&#x27;s not a strong type of perfume and you don&#x27;t have to use very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even got my sister using it.</li>
    <li> MY COUSIN LOVES CHLOE AND IT IS GETTING HARD TO FIND.  SHE LOVES THE BODY LOTION AND WAS SO HAPPY WITH HER GIFT.  IT ARRIVED TIMELY AND IT ALL IN ALL WAS AN EXCELLENT SHOPPING CHOICE.</li>
    <li> Smells nothing like perfume</li>
    <li> My wife loves this lotion- can&#x27;t find it at ANY store anymore - got to our house in 4 days.   WC</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, but this is not the New Chloe she loved it anyway.</li>
    <li> My Chloe Body Lotion arrived very quickly and in perfect condition.  I have been unable to find this product for a couple of years so was extremely happy to find it here.  This lotion smells absolutely wonderful and moisturizes my skin without feeling greasy.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been paying 3 times as much for Chloe lotion at other sites the past few years.  I was able to buy 2 for my mother this year at Christmas at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance and all in all nice lotion. Goes well with the perfume. I would buy this product again as a gift.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews. Everyone&#x27;s opinion on perfume scents vary - but this stuff does nothing for me. It smells way to strong! Gave me a headache. Wish i could return</li>
    <li> Whether I use the product in six months or two years, it still has the same fresh smell.  Thank you</li>
    <li> A very good price.  It was a gift and the person who received the gift said thank you very much.</li>

    <li> It didn&#x27;t smell like Chloe usually does, had a very heavy smell, like a perfume that was a few years old.</li>
    <li> my brother in law told me my sister liked this product so i ordered it for one of her christmas presents.  as far as i know she is pleased with it.  the order process was smooth and although the estimated possible delivery dates extended past christmas, the product arrived with several days to spare.</li>
    <li> really love this scent.  Had to put it in refrigerator cause when UPS delivered it was sooo hot I couldn&#x27;t even put it on.  But in spite of that fact the aroma was still there and did not hurt it.  Will order more as soon as I run out.  Fast delivery. Great Product.  Thank you</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like the perfume but it is still a pleasant scent and works as a lotion. It serves it&#x27;s purpose as a lotion but I was hoping to layer it with the perfume.</li>
    <li> Love love LOVE Chloe! I wore it daily a long time ago, but I just couldn&#x27;t afford it after hubby and kids came along. I&#x27;m so glad to have it again! This is a great product. Softens the skin and stays &amp;#34;Chloe&amp;#34; all day! Great price. Great value.</li>
    <li> This body lotion is not very easy to find but I can always find it at a great price here.  I was able to stock up on the lotion and am set for a while.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love anything Chloe! So I knew I would love this lotion and I do. It is creamy and silky and I love the scent. I would love to but this again. Also a great price too!</li>
    <li> This is just a lovely classic fragrance.  As a lotion it is light and fresh.  Easy to wear just about anywhere.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Chloe lotion and Chloe perfume for the past 25 years.  It is the only scent that I wear.  It is soft, and subtle.</li>
    <li> I prefer my scents to be more subtle, and this lotion is pretty in-your-face about its flower power. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I love chloe. It goes well with my body chemistry and the price I paid for the lotion was not bad.</li>
    <li> The product was great but the container looked like it had fallen off a truck when I took it out of the box.  All scuffed up!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this lotion.  It&#x27;s my absolute fave scent.  Can&#x27;t get enough of it and recommend it to everyone.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> The Chloe lotion is great.  My original tube ran out - liked it so much I needed to have more.  Have been using it for a long time.  I also use the cologne, so it&#x27;s nice to have lotion that doesn&#x27;t fight with the scent.  I really like Chloe&#x27;s scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mother a few years ago and she just loves it.  When she runs out of the lotion it is very hard to find it again.  I&#x27;m so glad Amazon can alert me when a store has it in stock.  Now when the lotion comes in I try to buy as many as I can.  I definitely recommend this lotion.  It smells really nice, a light scent, not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and feel of the lotion on my skin. I wear it everyday. It&#x27;s great and hope always be available</li>
    <li> awful and cheap smell! I threw it away after the first use.</li>
    <li> Chloe has a wonderful, elegant fragrance and when applied goes on smoothly leaving you with a day long feeling of \\&quot;being finished\\&quot;, complete!</li>
    <li> My favorite!  This item is getting hard to find. And being my favorite fragrance, I can always find it on Amazon.  Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this lotion is new but I&#x27;ve never seen it before. I love it, it goes right into your skin and smells gut</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. The Cloe Body Lotion must have been very old because the perfumed scent that is so&lt;br /&gt;appealing about this lotion was not there. I would be very skeptical about ordering any other perfumes or&lt;br /&gt;cosmetics on line in the future.</li>
    <li> Great scent in a lotion no longer available in the stores.  Easy to apply and absorbs quickly without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I was excited to find the body lotion because I love Chloe perfume. It was very liquid and smell like cheap avon creams but nothing like the Chloe scent. Very disappointing paying more than $15 for something that smells this bad. I have bought the body lotion to match Miracle from Lacome and it smells just like the perfume and I was hoping to find the same results with this one but not. Makes me wonder...</li>
    <li> I was bummed out.  It smells like the original Chanel. Definitely does not smell like I expected, very different than the Chloe perfume scent, I wish it had notes of roses :( I cant really wear the lotion and perfume together.</li>
    <li> I receive compliments constantly when I use this fragrant lotion - hot weather, cold weather, any time I wear it.</li>
    <li> Not the Chloe it used to be but closer to the real thing than that new Chloe that they are selling.. it smells awful.</li>
    <li> Pleased with purchase.  The scent is not overpowering and wears off gradually through the day.  I would recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> Chloe is my smell and fragrance.  Over 20 years ago, I walking thru the Oakland Airport and a man with his wife stopped me and inquired what scent was I wearing!  Many more people have stated that this scent is Mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chloe might want me for a commercial!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I need to be able to purchase the powder at a reasonable rate.</li>
    <li> I have used Chloe lotion for almost 30 years.  I&#x27;ve not used another fragrance since I first tried Chloe.  I have used the other Chloe products but the lotion creates a soft floral fragrance all over and makes me feel soft and feminine.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that the fragrance can be over-powering.  I just add Chloe to an unscented lotion.  You can then create the fragrance that suits you.  [[ASIN:B000VON7SC Chloe By Chloe For Women, Body Lotion, 6.8-Ounce Bottle]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware of the imitation product!  It isn&#x27;t the same as the original.</li>
