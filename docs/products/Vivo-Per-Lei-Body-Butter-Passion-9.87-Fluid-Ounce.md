    <li> I think it may be good to use in winter, since it&#x27;s kinda condensed. The fragrance is too strong, kinda make you a little bit uncomfortable. I does make your skin softer though.</li>
    <li> I love this body butter and it&#x27;s even better when it&#x27;s an Add-On item. The only thing I&#x27;m not thrilled with is the &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; smell. But the product itself is great. Absorbs without leaving a greasy feeling and skin is incredibly smooth.</li>
    <li> I love it. only have to apply one a day it last all the day. It smells very good and skin feels smooth.</li>
    <li> As the rating implys, I like other Vivo Per Lei Products, so I tried the body butter. I found it non greasy and soothing on my skin.</li>
    <li> At first it I was disappointed,another lotion that doesn&#x27;t help my dry skin.I continued using it and overtime it began to nourish my skin.I use it on my 7 yr old too.It has a lovely,mild fragrance,blends in easily.</li>

    <li> I ordered this product in conjunction with a face peel and eye cream of the same brand. The peel is awesome. This cream is ok, moisturizing but not greasy. However, the smell is way too strong. It&#x27;s pleasant but way too strong...</li>
    <li> Ugh I hated the smell of it, it smells like an old women perfume very very very very sweet. I then thought well if it works and hydrates I can get passed the smell but nope doesn&#x27;t even hydrate better than a drug store body lotion</li>
