<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have a Braun 8995 shaver which is fairly good but upon reading the reviews I just had to try out the Panasonic and I am v impressed. &lt;br /&gt;Dry it shaves v slightly closer than the braun but with just a splash of water and a dab of king of shaves gel the result is amazing and quite quick too, a v close shave in about 2 minutes. I keep stroking my face to feel the smoothness. &lt;br /&gt;I dont use the cleaning station, I just rinse it under the tap so the only ongoing cost will be the foil and cutters but with the results I am getting I am well pleased.</li>
    <li> Comparing this unit to my current shaver (which is also a Panasonic Linear, model ES8068) the older model does a *much* better job, plus having an induction charger. On the Vortex, the automatic clean takes THREE hours and its better just to soap and rinse the blades than use the cleaning system. The Vortex is a disappointment as far as performance goes.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this by stating that I&#x27;m a long-time fan of Panasonic Wet/Dry Linear razors and that the ES8168S was my 3rd in this series.  I bought it to replace my now-tired ES8152NC which had replaced my ES 8065 even earlier.  Unfortunately, each model I upgraded to was not up to par with the one they were replacing.  You see, I&#x27;m cursed with very thick facial hair and sensitive skin.  Shaving with a blade simply reduces my face to a rashy mess so I have to stick with electrics that can best help me achieve a close shave without breaking me out.  Enter the hall-of-famer: The ES 8065.  To this day I have never encountered a better razor.  It was fast, powerful and cut through my stubble like butter.  I had to be careful with the pressure I used or I&#x27;d break out but I could manage it just fine.  Sadly, this unit finally couldn&#x27;t seal out water any more so I relegated it to backup status and bought myself an ES8152NC.  I don&#x27;t know if it was because of the more tightly spaced blades, the fact that the foils were housed in a plastic instead of metal block, or whatever, but it just took more work to get the same close shave as before.  Even then I still did dry touch-ups with my 8065.  After finally running the &#x27;52 into the ground, I decided to pick up an ES8168S and hoped for the best.  Not only did it not match my 8065 (not even close) it actually had a harder time cutting my facial hair than the 8152!  I gave it a fair shot, using it every morning for 29 days, before returning it.  What happened, Panasonic?  Please go back to the metal block, high torque, probably more expensive to produce, just plain superior design traits the 8065 exhibited!  In the meantime, I&#x27;m off the bandwagon and searching for a good wet/dry electric razor.  I currently have Sanyo&#x27;s new SV-RX10 on the way from Amazon as I write this.  Their specs look promising and I&#x27;ll be sure to write a review after living with it for a month.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this shaver out. I knew the shaver had to be good because of its past reviews. Heck, for $170 I expected something pretty good. I have tried the high end line of Braun and Norelco shavers. They cannot touch this shaver. When I received this shaver I had not shaved for a month and had a fairly tough beard. I was expecting to have an unpleasant shave. This thing shaved my beard with ease and it felt comfortable. It felt unreal. After I was done shaving, my face felt as if I had shaved with a Mach 3 razor. I could not feel ANY stubble, and I&#x27;m not exaggerating. I didn&#x27;t even use any shaving cream, which this shaver allows you to do since it&#x27;s a wet/dry. You can even use it in the shower. You can also clean this shaver with just soap and water. The cleaning solution is not required, but it helps. The only two things that I could criticize about it is that because of the power and speed of the blades, it makes shaving around the lip area a bit scary. I use the trimmer to get close to those areas. The second thing is that it takes a fairly long time to clean, dry and charge, but only if you use the cleaning solution. As I said before, you can just clean it with soap and water and charging doesn&#x27;t take that long. I just can&#x27;t fathom how someone could be disappointed with this shaver.</li>
    <li> This product does shave as good as a blade, dry shaving or wet with shaving cream. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because of the other Panasonic shavers that i purchaced. This one performs perfectly and seem to shave a little closer.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers for 16 years. One Braun and Three Philips. None of them came to the results that I have with this Panasonic. There is no burning on your skin and no red spots after the shave(which I occasionally have with Philips).   Although I prefer dry shaving I get better results with wet face and even better if I use some lubricative. I am using a thin layer of shaving foam that makes my skin slippery!!!. The cleaning is very easy. Just drop some liquid soap and then let it work for few seconds, You see the result... (I mean it, it looks like the shaver pukes the shaved tiny hair pieces out of its blades:)  First week I had problems on my skin but I know it happens with any machine till your skin gets used to.  Only disadvantage is the battery. My Philips HQ 6725(wet/dry) lasted 12-14 days. This one lasts exactly 6-7 days not more.  I have been hearing good things about Panasonic machines now I know for sure. But not All Panasonic Machines are like this. Dont be fooled by models that does automatic cleaning (only means extra money you need to pay same quality and same motor) or older models with less than 13,000 motor. Braun has a new model with a high motor but I heard it is pricy.  All you need a Panasonic with 13,000 motor the rest are if you have some extra money.</li>
    <li> This would be a very nice shaver, however I returned it, unused, for the simple reason that it does NOT run while plugged in.      I&#x27;d tried extensively to determine if it would, on Panasonic&#x27;s website, where the product was not even listed, prior to ordering:  nowhere was I able to determine if one could shave plugged in.    i meant to give it four stars though mis-clicked, and it isn&#x27;t editable.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Panasonic to replace my Braun 7000 series. The Panasonic was a great shaver when the blade was sharp. The blade lasted 6 months, if that. Put a new blade in the Braun, gave the Panasonic to my son.</li>
    <li> I bought this to surprise my husband, whose old Norelco was finally worn out after years of good service. We were quite pleased with the close shave and ease of cleaning. An excellent value.</li>
    <li> This shaver is certainly one of the best I have used. I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 or 7 months now. The shave is very close both wet and dry, the battery life is decent, and the cleaning system does its job fairly well. There are a few drawbacks however: &lt;br /&gt;1) After about 4 or 5 months the foil started to irritate my face pretty bad and needed to be replaced as small holes had developed on it.  &lt;br /&gt;2) A wet shave produces results about as good as a blade, but it&#x27;s certainly not any more convienient. &lt;br /&gt;3) The cleaner runs for several hours (cleaning AND drying). This seems excesive to me.  &lt;br /&gt;4) The dang thing was pretty darned expensive. And replacement parts aren&#x27;t cheap either. Makes me wonder if there were other shavers just as good but cheaper.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, a very good shaver (should be for the price). Definitely beats the Brawn syncro that I replaced. Is it worth it? Tough to say.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never liked these cordless razors, my fathers norelco years and years ago would shave you but i always thought of it as more of a trimmer than an actual shave compared to a regular razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently though due to my schedule i have been increasingly busy and thought i would give one of these a shot in case i ever needed a quick shave in the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is incredible, not only is this the lexus of shavers, it shaved me so damn close that my shave looks as if i had wet shaved with shaving cream and a razor, and this was dry, so i can imagine that a wet shave with a little lather would be incredibly smooth!  As it is, the first time i used it, it did leave my face incredibly smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was unsure when i bought this if it was worth the price, but believe me, this shaver is not your fathers old shaver.  This thing is perfect, and to top it all off, it even cleans, charges, and dry&#x27;s itself! Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 out of 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> I used my new ES8168S Men&#x27;s Vortex Hydra Clean System with Convex razor today for the first time after having used a Braun Foil shaver for many years, and must say I fell in love with my new buy immediately.  I have a very heavy beard and this razor steadfastly yet gently shaved it all off like none has ever done before. Normally I have to repeat strokes over and over again, this one just got it all in one pass. THANK YOU for inventing this machine.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver and feel it is better than the Norelco models. I do not use the cleaning cartridges due to the unecessary expense. It is not as good as a multi blade regular shave but for an electric it is the best I have tried.</li>
    <li> he says he&#x27;s getting a great shave and doesn&#x27;t have to spend the time cleaning!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve avoided electric razors for years after a bad experience with Norelco. But I cut myself for the last time and decided to try an electric again. This unit is amazing! Very comfortable shave and very close. Lightweight and easy to maneuver. My favorite feature is that you don&#x27;t have to BUY cleaning cartridges. You can use liquid soap and water. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This shaver is unbelievable. I had a Panasonic before but it was very noisy. This one is almost silent. The shave seems as close as a razor and it&#x27;s fast. I&#x27;ve been shaving with electric shavers for over 50 years and have never had one work as efficiently as this one.</li>
    <li> Pros: Close (but not Nanotec close) shave, Easy on skin, Well designed and built (made in Japan), Relatively quiet and low vibrating considering high motor speed, Cleaning system uses cheap and convenient cartridges, User replaceable battery, Good value    Cons: Lasts ridiculously short 35 minutes on a single charge, LCD is hard to see and shows remaining charge in 10% decrements only (no timer or remaining minutes like on Norelco)    Summary: If only it had Nanotec blades from newer ES8108S and ES8228S models. Or even better, if Norelco could shave this close while retaining all rotary advantages.    Contrary to some reviews this ES8168S model isn&#x27;t similar in all important features to newer ES8222S and ES8109S models. It lacks uniquely sharp Nanotec blades which as I found make quite a lot of difference in shave closeness. In fact Panasonic parts numbers for blades are different.    I learned this the hard way when switching from my current Norelco SmartTouch XL which I love dearly for everything but quality and fast shave. I read one of the reviews here touting qualities of Nanotec blades. Reviewer had ES8222S model but was assuring that ES8168S is same. After a week of using the new shaver I grew a little disappointed. It was delivering comfortable shave with no burning that also was somewhat closer and faster than Norelco but not by much. I started to think that having to put up with awkward handling (typical of foil shavers compared to rotaries) and with truly miserable battery life (35 minutes charge vs 98 with Norelco) was not worth it.     Then I realized that I never saw highly touted \\&quot;Nanotec blades\\&quot; written anywhere on a box or in the user manual. Some light googling immediately revealed that compared to ES822S and ES8109S ES8168S is an older model that has all other buzzwords like Vortex but not Nanotec. I got curious and ordered ES8109S. It&#x27;s cheaper and when you open the package it&#x27;s clear why - flimsy, cheaper materials, tacky shiny plastic abound, laughable excuse of a travel pouch, much noisier and is made in China. ES8168S is better in every other respect except for main thing - it was enough just to have a single shave with ES8109S to realize that Nanotec blades are the real deal. I actually was amazed by the difference which after few more shaves became even more noticeable. It&#x27;s the hands down closest and fastest shave (in both aspects approaching blades) I have ever experienced from electric. Amazingly this performance isn&#x27;t at the expense of comfort like you feel your whole skin burning.     Otherwise ES8168S is a very good, well built and comfortable shaver. If you don&#x27;t need best possible shave and can live with the closest next to best I would highly recommend it.    A little post-factum so you understand where I&#x27;m coming from when it comes to shaving. I switched from blades around 1o years ago and will never go back to this mess despite getting in general closer and faster shave than with electrics. During these 10 years I tried many shavers switching between foil brands (Pana Linears, Brauns, Remington) and various Norelco rotaries. For the last 4 years I settled on Norelcos - first James Bond model and now SmartTouchXL.  Before Norelco I used Linear for a couple of years.     I love everything about Norelcos - luxurious feel on skin of a big easy gliding head, very hushed almost Lexus like sound, lack of vibration, substantial feel in the hand, good battery life, helpful LCD information, etc. When you shave with Norelco you feel like dignified gentelman while my recollections about Brauns and Linear were of the crude and kinda agricultural nature. Only two things are missing from Norelcos - close and fast shave.     I don&#x27;t believe I have especially sensitive skin or tremendously thick or fast growing stable. Maybe I have a lot of face estate and some unusual growth patterns but no matter with what I shave it takes longer than average (I asked friends and coworkers) to get a decent shave and I have to go back and forth in different directions around certain spots (and not chin). Even with blades I had to do two passes  with last one against the grain. With Norelcos morning shave became a 8 minute affair to get a half decent shave that will last you till maybe 5pm.  That explains why I ventured again into Pansonic shavers.</li>
    <li> The shave I received from thsi product was INCREDIBLE. It was obscenely close such that I was surprised when I finished. It is a bit pricey, but seems to be worth the money. The auto clean function is very handy for keeping a sharp blade. NOW THE BAD NEWS..this was my first electric razor and as a black man it shaved way to close. I developed hair bumps immediately within a day. If it was not for that, I woul dhave kept but sadly returned the product. If ingrowns are not a problem for you, this gives a super close shave. Just another black man in search of a shave product that won&#x27;t give me ingrowns. I have moved on to a throwback, the Remington ES-1000. Good luck to me. FYI, for all you ingrown suffers, there is a great prescription product (Canadien only) that eliminated initial stages of ingrowns overnight....Neo-Medrol. An acne medication that has the side benefit of controlling hair bumps. Put it on and I am bump free!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with the 8168S for about 5 months now.  It is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, though not perfect.  In general the shaver is very well thought out affording the user many choices that most shavers don&#x27;t.  The wet/dry feature is perhaps the most significant of these.  This also allows you to rinse the razor clean after each use under ordinary tap water dispensing with the need for brushes, and working much better.  The charging/washing unit works well. I&#x27;ve seen complaints about its long cycle time, but so long as the razor is ready for use the next time I need it (in 24 hours) I really don&#x27;t see how this makes any difference.  The grip and design are nice.  The linear motor is great -- keeping the razor runing as if fully charged until it has no charge left instead of slowing down as most do.  I have also found that this razor is the kindest to my face -- I&#x27;ve yet to come away with a cut, raspberry, or abrasion, whereas this was quite commong with the Brauns I had used for years before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it still requires many many passes over the face to produce a smooth shave -- certainly no less and probably more, than the Braun.  So all this technology is not in the end producing much of a difference in actual shaving performance.  I wonder if this razor had the nano blades whether it would shave better.  I don&#x27;t understand why this razor -- seemingly the flagship of the Panasonic line -- does not have their best blade technology (contrary to some other reviews, there is no mention of the nano blade technology in connection with this razor in marketing literature or on the box).  I can only hope that the replacement blades will incorporate this technology, and that if they do it will make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, as I said, its the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used in a field that I believe generally underperforms expectations.</li>
    <li> I have used many electric shavers over the past 35 years, including models from Braun, Norelco and Remington. None of these has ever worked as well as this shaver. In the past, when I have let my beard grow for 2-3 days, I could never get my electric shaver to work well. This shaver cuts right through, as if I had just shaved the day before. The closest shave I have ever had with no skin irritation at all. Do yourself a favor and order this shaver.</li>
    <li> Got the Panasonic to replace an older Braun. I&#x27;m a razor guy, but I will use  a electric occasionally. The shave this Panasonic gives is the best that I have ever had from an electric. With a couple of passes, the shave approaches the closeness of a razor, but with no chance of cuts or scrapes. If I want a real close shave, the razor still wins, but the Panasonic is a close second.</li>
    <li> About once every two years I feel moved to write a positive review. This shaver is that incredible. I used high end Norelcos for years and they are what Ford Taurus is too Mercedes S Class (Panasonic). This is the real deal, and some silly toy with oozing gels and nagging cleaning reminders. I noticed some reviewers still say they occasionally go back to blade for close shaves. I cannot imagine why. I run the cleaning cycle every day and no twin blade can compare to a thorough 5 min shave with this bad boy (never used 3-4 blades). As others have mentioned, this shaver is far less expensive on other sites, but this is a good place for a review.</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced a Panasonic shaver that I had for more than ten years. It gives the best shave that I&#x27;ve ever got from an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I looked at all of the reviews and thought this was going to finally pull me away from Braun. Sadly, no. The cleaning system is useless since it doesnt wash away the clippings, my system just kept them on top of the shaver head once the process completed the shave was ok nothing spectacular as many of the reviewers would have you believe. It was worth a shot, maybe I got a bad one I dunno, back to Braun it is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for about two months now.    I upgraded to the es8168s from an 8(?) year old Panasonic wet/dry shaver.  The es8168s cuts closer and doesn&#x27;t pull at two day old hairs like my old one did so I can go longer without shaving occasionally.  The slightly curved head really helps with the neck area when shaving.  I no longer have to go over and over the same area to get a good shave on the neck.      The cleaner is okay so far.  No gripes and seems to do a good job.  I clean it about once a week in the base cleaner/charger.  And I clean it under the faucet daily.    They use a lithium based battery now vs the NiMH battery in my old Panasonic shaver, and I noticed that it used to take about 10-15% of the charge to complete a shave for me.  But after about 2 months I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s taking closer to 20% or so to do the same shave.  The battery is already starting to die.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I took the charge down too low before charging but the manual doesn&#x27;t say anything about it and I typically recharged when it got to 20% left.    The good news is the battery can be replaced and the manual shows how to do it.  There is better lithium battery technology that many of the cordless power tools are using such as A123 batteries which take much more abuse and can be deep discharged multiple times without problems.  Maybe in the next model they will use such a battery.</li>
    <li> OK, so I think one of the best things about Amazon are the reviews by actual users. Reading them is what really got me to buy this razor, even though in the back of my mind I thought the best reviewers were shills for Panasonic. THEY WERE NOT! Or, if they are, let me add my name to that list:&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic razor. Period. I&#x27;m a relatively hairy guy. Not Robin Williams hairy, but still hirsute. The last time I used a foil razor, I cut myself and thought I&#x27;d never go back to foil - it&#x27;d be only rotary or blade for me! But after my Norelco rotary stopped shaving close, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, thanks to the reviewers and the fact that I could get this razor totally wet or use it dry.&lt;br /&gt;This machine is simply amazing. Like Japanese cars, it is designed to interact with humans perfectly. From the \\&quot;click\\&quot; of the plastic foil guard, to the floating foil over your chin, it all is so well designed it&#x27;s a pleasure just to use. It feels perfect in my hand too - so much so, I would be happy to just carry it around the house all day.... As it is, whenever any of my male friends come over, I talk up this razor.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, yes, it vibrates at something like the speed of light and its blades are at some angle that no other razor has, etc, etc. So what? Does it do what it says? Will I have to return it after the 30 day trial? Absolutely yes and more! and Heck NO!&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased with this machine that I am STILL amazed how it shaves my face. I prefer shaving dry, but it does wet too (a plus for me) and it is as if I had used a blade. This closeness is consistent. Panasonic advises that users give one&#x27;s face time to adjust to this razor before they work together. I was hooked the first time it whisked my whiskers away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: you&#x27;re supposed to use the little tub of razor-cleaning fluid in the included cleaning/charging base.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: THE CLOSENESS OF THE SHAVE! You don&#x27;t have to use the cleaning base - just press and hold the on button and it vibrates REALLY fast, squirt some liquid soap on it, and rinse. The battery lasts a long time. It&#x27;s fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? Without question.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps you make a decision. Happy shaving!liquid soap on it, and rinse. The battery lasts a long time. It&#x27;s fun to use.  Would I buy it again? Without question.  Hope this helps you make a decision. Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> This the the best shaver out their. It gets so close to the skin that it feels like you have wet shaved. My only complaint is when the item cleans itself, it is loud as hell and takes forever to do so.</li>
    <li> The best: beter than Braun, Norelco or Phillips.  I have thick fast growing hair, so I speak from experience.</li>
    <li> I did alot of homework before buying this shaver. I have had great luck with Panasonic razors, and knew that I would buy another. The question was: Which model? This model fits well in your hand, and feels solid. The base is great and performs charges and cleaning very competently. I profess that I do not use the cleaning feature that often, but it is nice to have. Overall.....a very close shave, and a very well made product.</li>
    <li> i have very very sensitive skin, making shaving a once or twice a week venture for me at most. when i tried shaving every day with an electric razors i would literally bleed from my pores....it hurt, it burned, it created ingrown hairs..... this with both a braun and a norelco that i tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so after reading a few reviews on this i thought, this is it, if this one doesn&#x27;t work i&#x27;ll know that i&#x27;ll just have to be scruffy for the rest of my life. i bought it and got it a week and change ago....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have shaved every day since i got this thing. every single day. no bleeding, minimal bumping, and a close enough shave to keep me happy. close as a blade? no - at least when i use it dry (haven&#x27;t tried wet/shaving cream yet). but who cares?!?!?! i can shave daily again! i even skipped a day this last weekend and had no problem with the longer beard hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s quiet, the trimmer works fine, and charges quickly as well.&lt;br /&gt;so like i said above, stop reading this and other reviews - just scroll up and buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;go on.....</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve been using electric shaver for the last 10-15 years. I tried a few models on the market and they were OK. When I read review for this shaver I thought, as usual, that it&#x27;s another marketing trick. But since so many folks left such nice reviews I decided to give it a try.  I want to tell you that I have NEVER EVER used anything designed and built so beautifully. I 100% agree that this shaver gives as close shave to the regular shaver as it can be. I think that Panasonic itself now is challenged to improve this product. Great product, great shaving experience. I don&#x27;t have a single point of complaint. Thanks for the product.</li>
    <li> I have both a Pulsonic 9595 and the Panasonic ES8168. The Panasonic is close, but maybe too close! I came away with two nicks that needed light Steptic liquid to stop what was light bleeding on my upper lip. I use it for occasional touch-ups about an hour or two after shaving heavy stubble. The Braun is never uncomfortable, on long stubble it&#x27;s a dream, most comfortable shave with the vibration, consumer search Validates this, (Consumer search testers whomever they are). I shave first, than shower...if you want the ultimate shave, finish with the 360 Complete, it&#x27;s closer(Not by much), but not as comfortable as the Pulsonic on first cut. The finish which is not uncomfortable, after having the main stubble off. What the hell am I doing, when you have a face shaped like a brick, the blade requires a steptic pencil(Always). This all has been an experiment to get around daily trauma, I am finally comfortable @ 47, no nicks! And yes you would spend serious money to get around this...</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this system.This is my first Panasonic shaver,my first one that self-cleans and  the first with wet and dry features. I use just a little bit of shaving gel on my face and it works great. I have never tried it in the shower,but since it is designed for wet shaving it should do well. I have had this  razor for about a month and I was sold on it by others who had great things to say in their reviews. It shaves me closer than any shaver I have ever had,and in half the time! It keeps its charge very well and after I use it I will either rinse it off or use the self-cleaning system. I look forward to years of  great service from this razor. It&#x27;s too bad I hadn&#x27;t discovered it sooner!</li>
    <li> I became tired of the never ending tries against various norelco shavers, which functioned the same way, and only differentiated themselves in style    Wanted to try something new so read reviews and went with the Panasonic... i do find that i get a closer shave ... but it takes a while and as another reviewer mentioned is noisy     Works better wet than dry !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic wet/dry shavers for more than 10 years and this is one of the worst models for wet shaving yet.  For some reason, the last few models of Panasonic shavers that I&#x27;ve had just haven&#x27;t held up to wet shaving the way they should.  I haven&#x27;t given up yet on Panasonic, but I&#x27;m close.</li>
    <li> I shave daily and have used blades exclusively for years.  Wanted to try and speed up the morning ritual so I decided to investigate electric shavers.  I read review after review and visited some of the shaving blogs and finally decided the ES8168S was the one for me.  I have used it for a week and am satisified with the results.  It is not blade close but does a good job and saves time.  I do not use the cleaning/charging base so this saves on future costs.  You can clean it using liquid soap and water just as well.</li>
    <li> This is a very amazing electric shaver, i have very stiff whiskers and this thing cuts through them like their nothing leaving smooth skin... and that&#x27;s using it dry! If you use this razor wet with a light lather it cuts smoother and even closer than a Mach 3 razor without any irritation. The automatic cleaner works very well rinsing the blades and drying them with a fan and heater. I would highly recommend this razor to anyone, it is well worth the high price... you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I have been using a Gillette Mach 3 for a long time. I have been very apprehensive about picking up electric razors because I believed they would make the beard hair tough, or that it would hurt the skin in the long term. I have looked around quite a lot, and hit upon this item in Amazon. After looking at the reviews, I decided it was time I give the electric razor a try. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And have I been right on target! I got this razor online (I got a much better deal elsewhere). The first shave was not that exciting. But I knew I needed to give my beard some time to get used to the new shaving method. The razor initially didn&#x27;t catch and cut all the hair. It used to miss hair under the chin quite a lot. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I took some time to get used to it. After about 5-6 shaves, I felt a lot more comfortable, and grew more confident in the way I attack my beard. I slowly worked out a circular motion that worked perfectly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maintenance is really easy. Its easy to clean, dry and charge the unit. This chore is a lot less painful than using shaving foam etc. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviews here say that the shave is quick. Yes, the shave can be quick, but if you want the smoothness you&#x27;d get using manual shavers, it is going to take almost the same time. But since you do not have to conventrate on what you&#x27;re doing, you can easily multi-task and finish the job. So, you actually end up saving time in the morning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shave is as close as a Mach III. But its a lot lot easier. I will never go back to Mach III. (Even if I have to, my beard will not like it).</li>
    <li> If you want to forget having problems shaving this razor is for you.  I have always had problems shaving.  So much to the extent of shaving every other day to give me time to let my face recover.  I have always had to deal with ingrown hairs and burns.  I held optimism that one day I would find the razor to take my pain away.  Trying the most expensive disposable razors like the Mach and being satisfied that was the best I would get.  It didn&#x27;t just stop at razors but with shave gels.  On a quest to find something that would sooth my face.  My search was endless.  I decided to invest in this razor in hopes it would be the answer.  After one use I knew my face was in heaven.  Now after having it for nearly two months my face is free of all burning and ingrown hairs.  I don&#x27;t get notorious bumps on my neck and my face is smooth.  This razor is perfect and it cleans itself.  I can go one week(six or seven uses) without charging.  I only use this razor in the shower.  It works perfectly for me and I can only hope for many more months of great shaves.  Thank you Panasonic you have made my day...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a half-dozen electric razors over the years, both of the foil and rotary style, and this is my most recent.  It is not the best I&#x27;ve had, but quite good.  Here are my pros and cons:    Pros:  - Powerful motor cuts my beard easily.  - Smooth shave - probably the best I&#x27;ve had from an electric.  - Nice accessories - the cleaning station, etc. are pretty easy to use.  - Light weight and easy to carry.    Cons:  - Makes a mess.  Leaks little hair dust all over, far worse than any other electric I&#x27;ve owned.  - Charges slowly compared to other razors I&#x27;ve had.  - Charge does not last as long as some (such as the Norelco I had previously).  I&#x27;d gladly have it weigh an ounce more for an extra couple days of use between charges.  - Beard trimmer feels cheap and its locking mechanism seems less reliable than others I&#x27;ve used.  (I&#x27;ve never had to consciously think about \\&quot;did I click the trimmer into place?\\&quot; before and on this razor I have to think about it or it doesn&#x27;t lock.)    Neither here nor there:  - Percentage charged readout only shows multiples of 10%. Personally, I preferred the \\&quot;minutes left\\&quot; readout on my previous razor.  - Cleaning system takes a long time and is quite noisy.  This is the first razor I&#x27;ve bought with a cleaning station, so I&#x27;m not sure if this is any better or worse than the norm.  - Getting a close shave is not particularly fast with this razor, though as mentioned above, the end result is very good.    All in all, I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars based on the ease of shaving and the smoothness of the end result, despite the shortcomings.</li>
    <li> I was visiting CA (coming from France) and was looking for a new razor (my french one has just broken). In Europe, many reviews i read were good for the Pana.    Just got and tried: very soft, not too much noisy. After i have a baby skin. Easy to clean.     Better than Philips or Braun, even if it&#x27;s better to experiment. Nevertheless, a very good choice, sometimes the best: depends...</li>
    <li> Be careful with the warranty as Sharper Image will not honor it without trying to find any what they can to get out of the responsibility.</li>
    <li> The shaver is awesome. It cuts real close. I am glad I read the reviews of this shaver here on Amazon. It&#x27;s a pretty accurate review that this shaver is one of the best. I have tried other brand, such as Braun. This beats it hands down.This is my second Panasonic shaver. I had the previous one for 8 years. They do last. This one was made in Japan, not China. So the quality is there in look and feel. I am glad I bought it when it was on sale here.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this shaver.  It doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as I&#x27;d like.  I have a typical beard thickness.  I&#x27;m not some ape.      I have used it w/shave cream too!  IF YOU SHAVE WITH A MACH 3 manual razor AND THINK THIS WILL MIMIC THE CLOSENESS, IT WILL NOT!  It does a poor job on my neck and throat.      Doesn&#x27;t cause irritation though, but who cares when it doesn&#x27;t give you a clean cut shave.  I have had this for a couple of months now, so I&#x27;m not prematurely rating this.  I have also tried different shaving techniques and it still gives me unsatisfactory results.     Trimmer sucks on it.  WTH?!</li>
    <li> This is my second Panasonic razors.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other brand as this one is perfect.  Use it anywhere, in the shower, in the tub, in the nude, fully dressed.    You get a good close shave and the clean up time is in seconds.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000BQOO8W Panasonic ES8077S Linear Pivot Shaver]]    My third Panasonic Linear shaver in 15 years.  This one is the quietest yet.  It also holds a charge longer than any previously owned models.  I like the cleaner/dryer/charging dock.  I only hope I get longer life from this product this time.  It shaves as close as most electrics, especially in the wet mode.</li>
    <li> I use this 3 times a week to shave my entire head and face.  I have replaced the foil screen twice and the blade once.  That is a grand total of about $35 in replacement parts over 6+ year of regular use.  Good value and good results from a picky dude.  Will buy another.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not often people take the time to write a review about something like an electric shaver, BUT, this product truely deserves the recognition.  Here&#x27;s what I have found. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I HAVE REALLY TESTED THEM ALL ! &lt;br /&gt;I am very particular about spending my hard earned on something that seems cheap or looks like it only cost $5 to make overseas.  So I generally tend the gravitate to the higher/highest end of product lines. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have tested and owned the following: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Norelco&#x27;s newest Speed XL&#x27;s 9170XLCC &lt;br /&gt;Norelco Spectra 8 James Bond series &lt;br /&gt;Norelco&#x27;s Cool shave Nivea lotion dispenser built in (Don&#x27;t even bother!) &lt;br /&gt;Braun&#x27;s 360 #8995, Made in Germany-their best model   &lt;br /&gt;Panasonic ES8228 Vortex Nano Triple Blade HydraSystem II - A Brookstone Exclusive model but the same as the ES8168S &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have tested all of these over the course of 2 years.  They all perform cleaning functions with a cleaning unit, or they can be rinsed under a faucet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;HERE&#x27;S THE RESULTS &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;NORELCO&#x27;S &lt;br /&gt;Norelco&#x27;s newest Speed XL triple blade system is absolutely NO better than the Spectra 8 (James Bond Series) or above. It may actually be worse because of the smaller cutter sizes. It does however provide a comfortable shave that Norelco is most known for. It&#x27;s easy, smooth and quiet.  Anyone can use this shaver and not get nicked.  It&#x27;s a pleasure to hold and almost makes you move in circles which seems to attack the hair from any angle. As good as that is - IT JUST DOES NOT SHAVE AS CLOSE AS A BRAUN OR A PANASONIC.  Physics dictate that, the metal ringcups that hold the round blades are just to thick to pull the hair up and clip the hair below the surface as claimed. The cleaning system is huge and not \\&quot;intelligent\\&quot; like Braun&#x27;s.  Overall a proven solid performer.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;THE BRAUN 360 #8995 &lt;br /&gt;This unit has a much better pivoting head design than past models and has a very unique foil that is supposed to grabthe hairs more effeciently - well, it definately provides a closer shaver than previous models.  This shaver however is WORK. To get a really close shave you need to follow their directions of stretching and pulling your skin tight.  Most guys do this somewhat anyway, but to really get a close shave with this unit expect to work at it, AND expect to go over the same area in different directions.  The \\&quot;bar\\&quot; shaver is just designed that way, YOU provide the attack path on your beard.  Not a bad things but certainly more work.  Expect to get your closest shave after around 5 minutes at least. &lt;br /&gt;The Braun is the loudest shaver of the bunch, in fact annoying to those in the house.  The motor is truley slower than the Panasonic and it shows. It&#x27;s a clunky unit to hold by comparison to the Norelco, and the Panasonic.  BUT, it will definately shave closer than ANY Norelco to date. &lt;br /&gt;Cleaning unit is big bulky and loud but does a very good job.  The replacement cleaner tanks are WAY overpriced compared to the others. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;THE PANASONIC VORTEX NANO SYSTEM. &lt;br /&gt;I happen to have bought mine from Brookstone, and yes I paid a $50 premium to have their special color (a light beige/silver) with wood grain finger rests and a backlight LCD.  It also has the SMALLEST cleaning unit that matches the color of the shaver and is attractive. This keeps my wife happy since it&#x27;s not a lot of clutter, these cleaning units need to stay put.   &lt;br /&gt;THE TRUE TEST OF A CLOSER SHAVE AMOUNGST UNITS &lt;br /&gt;There really is only one way to test the units - shave 1/2 of your face with one unit, the other 1/2 with a different shaver.  I did this for many weeks. Almost any shaver is going to feel pretty smooth after you first shave, you&#x27;ll quickly notice which side was closer by the end of the day OR the next morning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ANOTHER GREAT TEST - I did this too! &lt;br /&gt;Shave your face with one brand, then immediately shave your face again with another unit. I WILL ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE THAT THESE PANASONIC VORTEX NANO&#x27;S WILL SHAVE YOU EVEN CLOSER AFTER A SHAVE FROM ANOTHER. You will notice this by the \\&quot;sound\\&quot; of your beard being cut.  It&#x27;s absolutely amazing!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;DESIGN AND ENGINEERING WINS ON THE PANASONIC &lt;br /&gt;THREE technologies seem to be completely advanced on the Panasonic as compared to anyone else.  They are MOTOR SPEED, 30 DEGREE BLADE ANGLE AND NANO BLADE SHARPENING.  Here are my results: &lt;br /&gt;1. Fastest Linear motor 13,000 rpm patented, it makes a BIG difference. &lt;br /&gt;2. Super quiet compared to the Braun and about the same as Norelco &lt;br /&gt;3. The entire head goes IN and OUT and pivots LEFT to RIGHT.  This is great because you can push in harder without fear of ruining the cutter foil or nicking yourself. &lt;br /&gt;4. The cutter head is slightly \\&quot;curved\\&quot; which makes a BIG differnce when moving in a circular attack. &lt;br /&gt;5. NO vibration incredibly at that speed, and comfortable to hold &lt;br /&gt;6. Cleaning unit is small fast and efficient.  Uses WATER in a much larger tank than anyone else and CLEANING detergent cartridge that&#x27;s a lot less money than anyones.  Hey, anyone can sell you alchohol in a cartridge, this is MUCH smarter, cleaner, and more economical. &lt;br /&gt;7. While on the road, you can clean the unit by simply pumping ordinary liquid soap onto the head while it&#x27;s running, let it suds up, then rinse off and let dry.  How cool is that! &lt;br /&gt;8. YES, it can be used in the shower if you want.  These units are WELL sealed and WELL made &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, I hope that helps you save time and money.  You could easily get this same unit from Amazon under a different model just make sure it has the following: &lt;br /&gt;1. Nano Blade Technology - a much sharper polishing system for their blades &lt;br /&gt;2. Vortex (convex blades and foil) &lt;br /&gt;3. HydaClean System II &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Make shaving fun again, go buy one.!</li>
    <li> These Panasonic 8100 series shavers are excellent but you can save a bit with some shopping. This shaver is essentially the same as the PANASONIC ES8167A Arc Shaver (I believe only the color is different).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also find this on Amazon (I have a more complete review there). This was the model sold by a certain high-end catalog for $249 but can be purchased much less through Amazon. During Christmas, it was down to $99 and this included the Vortex cleaning station. I believe it is a bit more now, but still worth comparing to the 8168 if you want to save a bit.</li>
    <li> I have tried other shavers including the top of the line Norelco 9190XL, 7745X Cool Skin, and Braun Activator, and none of them come close to this baby. The Norelcos always irritated my neck and made me break out and the Braun cut up my face so bad people would think i got into a fight with a gang of cats. This shaver gets closer then both the Norelcos and the Braun every time. I wouldn&#x27;t say its as close as a blade, buts its close enough for a completely smooth shave with no irritation. The cleaning system is nice and you don&#x27;t have to use it after every shave. Panasonic recommends that you put some liquid soap on the shaver, turn it on, and rinse it under water. I use the cleaning station when the shaver shoes an icon with a faucet, which is like once in ever 3 shaves. Going at this rate 1 cleaning cartridge should last me a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I went through several reviews and comparisons with Braun 360 and Norelco latest shaver before finalizing on the Panasonic vortex. I am really glad that I decided on this one. The looks are great. It is very lightweight, ergonomic. Nise level is acceptable, not loud or disturbing. The swivel head really helps around the chin edges. It shaves as good or better than the Mach-3 razor that I was using before. Battery life is excellent. I use it as a dry shaver once every two days and use 10% of the charge in each shave. So the charge last for 15 days. Cleaning is very easy. It can be cleaned with the regular hand liquid soap or the cleaning system that comes along with it can be used. I use the system once or twice a month and it does a nice job. Overall very satisfied and would definitely recommend to buy if considering for an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Looking at the pure economics of electric shavers I didn&#x27;t see too much of a benefit. Firstly I calculated the cost of high quality razor blades versus the cost of this shaver. 12 blades a year at roughly $3 a blade is about $36. Not that costly compared to an electric shaver especially considering that you will have to replace the electric blade, which is more expensive than a years worth of razors, after a year. Automatically it doesn&#x27;t seem worth it.    Next, looking at the time factor of shaving, shaving with a razor is probably faster. Not by much because you don&#x27;t have to continually rinse off the electric but it is close.    Lastly, it is still best to use shave cream which isn&#x27;t a cost you can subtract from the overall electic shaving equation.    Now, to the shave. The shave of this electric razor is great. It is as if I shave against the grain with a regular auxillary shaver but I don&#x27;t get any cuts. The hair does seem to be growing back at a different angle now, but either way this panasonic shaver is probably better than a standard razor shave.    Overall I am glad I made the purchase, especially considering the price of the Brauns when they are dry shave only. I cannot add a cost variable into the rating equation because I did a lot of research and was well aware of what I was buying before I clicked the submit order button.</li>
    <li> First, thank you to the other reviews in this section, as they were all very helpful to me in making a decision to purchase this product.  This is, without a doubt, the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned!  I do not find this to be noisier than the Norleco or Braun shavers I&#x27;ve used - electric shavers, oddly enough, make noise when they remove hair.  While I wish the charge would last longer, it&#x27;s a nonissue for me, when compared to the quality of shave and the fact I can use this with or without gel, and wet or dry.  Essentially, I bought this to shave my head (the dust storms in Iraq made me finally decide it was time to shave my grape clean), and it works phenominally!  It&#x27;s easier to use than the Braun or Norelco I&#x27;ve owned, shaves more quickly and far more closely.  I&#x27;ve used it on my face occasionally, and have been very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> The razor itself it not bad.  It shaves well, lasts a while on charge, and seems to work as good as any other electric shavers that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the base unit lets this device down greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a relic from the late 80s.  It has a kind of Knight Rider feel to it.  Dark shiny plastic, and weird unnecessary venting.  Green LEDs and unnecessarily weird shaped buttons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I could live with the weird style if it were not for how useless the base unit is.  First off it takes hours to actually clean and dry the shaver, far longer than other units I&#x27;ve used.  The cleaning cartridges don&#x27;t seem to last very long, and about one in four times the device chunters away for a couple of hours only to fail, leaving the shaver wet and smelly and not clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base unit is so noisy you are going to have to keep it in another room, away from your bedroom.  And putting it an adjoining bathroom, is not going to cut it.  It seriously needs to be quite some distance from you if you intend to be getting any sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I was initially impressed.  It does shave pretty well.  The shaver is in fact a pretty decent design.  But the dismal base unit is nothing but an annoyance.  For such a high tech and expensive unit, it just isn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
    <li> In summary, this shaver shaves the best out of the shavers I have used. I will say that after shaving with different shavers, both foil and rotary, there is no one perfect shaver. Each has things you will like and dislike.  I have used a Remington MS, Braun 8985 360 complete (owned for about a year),  Panasonic ES8077s, Norelco 8894XL, and now recently, the Panasonic ES8168S.    I&#x27;ll summarize each shaver&#x27;s highlights and dislikes:    Remington triple foil - Least favorite shaver. Shaves very close, as close as the Panasonic. Great trimmer that actually works. Unfortunately, you pay for the close shave with major shave burn. It misses hairs and doesn&#x27;t catch all, which requires use of the trimmer. Also, the model I had left hair clipping fall all over your shirt and counter. In addition, this model had poor build quality, as do the other remington&#x27;s... Read Remington reviews, you will notice they typically are known for having quality issues.    Braun 8985 - This is my second favorite shaver, or tied (only time will tell). Positives are 1) very comfortable shave. 2) allows for pivot action or lock and actually shaves closer on locked position. You would use pivot for more sensitive areas like the neck. 3) The charge/clean and renew station. Oh boy, At first, or when I owned it, I liked it. But, I thought like others, maybe it was a rip off the fact that you had to buy their cleaners every other month. However, after not having one (like when using the Norelco), I missed it! The braun has the best Clean/Renew /Charging station than any of the shavers I have tried. It is quick, and it works! leaves the shaver clean lubricated and smelling good. It is very hygienic. 4) Build quality seems very good. Comes with a hard case.  Very heavy to hold which gives the appearance of high quality... I like a heavy shaver as opposed to a cheap plastic one. Looks nice too. Negatives 1) Shave is not as close as Panasonic. 2) takes longer to shave than Panasonic (requires more work)Panasonic ES8077S - 1) good close shave over all 2) excellent trimmer 3) clean/charge station convenient to clean shaver.... Negatives 1) leaves face raw maybe too close, gave me ingrowns  2) charge/clean station takes way too long to dry 3) looks and feels light and flimsy (made in china) made from cheap plastics.     Norelco 8894XL - 1) Most comfortable shave out of all the shavers tested  2) battery lasted over 100 minutes! long time 3) very informative polymer display tells you how long your shave session was, how many minutes left on the battery, when you need to clean, etc 4) Shaves hairs fairly quickly. I could get a good shave in 8 minutes or less. 5) The most quiet out of all the shavers.... Negatives 1) Shaved the least closest out of all the shavers tried... 5 oclock shadow guaranteed by 5 oclock. 2)Because of the rotary design, had problems shaving areas under sideburns on side of the face and upper lip (everyone has the same problem with norelcos)  3) trimmer sucked and virtually unusable. 4)Very very very difficult to clean. Tedious to clean . And no, to me cleaning is not rinsing hairs out under of the faucet. Im referring to actually disinfecting and ensuring all accumulated little tiny hairs out of the blades. This is hard to do with the Norelcos and requires taking out each seperate head, letting it sit in alcahol, etc.       Panasonic ES8168S - 1) shaves very close while still feeling gentle. Catches pretty much all the hairs as long as you shave against the direction of the growth. 2) Excellent trimmer that actually works 3) build quality seems very very good (made in Japan) and doesn&#x27;t feel like cheap plastic (it actually has some weight to it). 3)clean/charge station not as good as Brauns but at least cleans out all the hairs and refreshes the shaver (lubricates). 4) can be used wet, though I haven&#x27;t tried it.   .... Negatives if any 1) A little Loud compared to the other shavers. 2) clean/charge station takes too long to dry (2hrs), which may not be convenient to use late in the day if you leave it in bedroom.        To summarize, the Panasonic ES8168S shaves the best out of all of them.It also feels sturdy and seems to be made of good materials, not cheap plastic like the ES8077S. In addition, it has a good trimmer which actually works. However, I wish the clean/charge station was as good as the clean/renew station from Braun. And also, I wish I had the intuitive Polymer display function of the Norelco 8994, as well as the 100+ min battery hold time. In all, I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this shaver to anyone looking to purchase a new electric.   Although I prefer the aesthetic looks of the braun and the effectiveness and convenience of the cleaning station, the performance (as in the shave) of the Panasonic, not to mention the steal of a price you can get one of these nowadays, definitely puts the Panasonic, in my opinion, in the #1 spot for the most \\&quot;Bang\\&quot; for your buck in the Electric shavers category.</li>
    <li> THIS SHAVER IS THE BEST ELECTRIC SHAVOR I EVER HAD. I HAVE HAD AT LEAST 5 OTHERS ALL ONE BRAND. I HAVE NEVER USED THE PANASONIC BEFORE. I WAS RECCOMMENDED TO THE RAZOR BY A FRIEND AND I TRIED IT. SINCE I HAVE IT NOW ABOUT 3 WEEKS I ONLY HAVE TO SAY ITS 5 STAR PLUS. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS GREAT WHEN YOU CALL FOR A QUESTION. ITS A PLEASURE TO SPEAK TO PEOPLE THAT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.  I ONLY HAVE A SMALL COMPLAINT. IN THE PACKAGE CAME A FLYER TO BUY CARTRIDGE REPLACEMENTS. I ORDERED 3 SPARES AND I WAS TOLD THE FLYER WITH THE PRICE IS OUT OF DATE. THAT DID ANNOY ME. THEY ARE THE VORTEX CLEANERS FOR THE SHAVER</li>
    <li> Finally, an electric that, as long as the user is willing to spend a little more time on the process, provides a shave as smooth and as close as a blade, and without all the nicks and cuts.  Expensive but worth it; six stars if that were an option.</li>
    <li> This is my second electric shaver, having used a Braun perhaps eight or ten years ago.  That shaver was OK, but not great; it would do in a pinch but hardly gave me what I&#x27;d call a close shave.  Eventually I went back to a standard three-bladed razor, and the Braun has since disappeared in a drawer somewhere, largely forgotten and certainly not missed.  It really wasn&#x27;t worth its asking price, at least not to me.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, since my skin is very sensitive, I&#x27;ve never been entirely happy with a blade, particularly on my neck.  I have to shave every other day (or less) to avoid uncomfortable irritation, and I skip shaving on the weekends entirely just to give neck a break.  I started looking around and doing some research on today&#x27;s electric shavers, and ran across the new Panasonic wet/dry series.  I also considered the rotary-type shavers, but wasn&#x27;t quite sold on them for my particular needs.  Based on the glowing reviews on this website and others, I decided to take the plunge and give the Panasonic a try.  I&#x27;ve been using my Vortex ES8168S for about three weeks now.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;End result:  Maybe the best personal grooming purchase ever, no exaggeration.  I just love this Panasonic shaver.  It gives me a shave that is basically indistinguishable from a razor.  Common convention says that you have to give your face a couple of weeks to adjust to an electric, but I didn&#x27;t find that to be the case--I just charged it up and started using it.  It works amazingly well, and WITHOUT IRRITATION.  Zero.  It&#x27;s an absolute Godsend for my sensitive skin.  Better yet, I can touch up any time without fear of the dreaded razor burn.     &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I really like the fact that you can use this shaver in the shower.  I find that if I use a little soap or a very small amount of shaving cream, I get a razor-quality shave.  No \\&quot;almost\\&quot; caveats here--it really is that good.  Dry shaving is maybe a smidge less close, but the convenience far outweighs any difference incloseness; in fact, I usually touch up with it out of the shower since it&#x27;s a bit easier to get those longer neck hairs using it dry.  A full charge gives me a week&#x27;s worth of shaving, and the LCD readout makes it simple to see how much you&#x27;ve got left.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is easy.  Just pop off the foil head and rinse.  I use the \\&quot;Hydra-Clean\\&quot; system once a week to really give it a good deep cleaning, but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s critical.  There is no fresh, lemony scent like that of the Braun Complete system, but that&#x27;s no big deal to me.  The cleaning/charging base is quite convenient and seems to work very well.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I suppose the only thing I found that might merit some caution is while shaving around one&#x27;s lips.  I caught my lower lip in the center slots and boy, did it smart.  However, this is pretty unusual and I chalk it up the fact that I can be kind of a klutz (or \\&quot;disaster magnet\\&quot; as my family calls me).  I recommend that you don&#x27;t stick your lips in it--or anything else you want to keep intact.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The ES8168S isn&#x27;t cheap (but with some careful shopping, it can be had for under a hundred bucks), but in my estimation it&#x27;s one of the few products I own that fully justify its price.  It has a money-back guarantee, but I won&#x27;t be returning mine unless it breaks.  I recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> If you are a professional that needs to shave on a daily basis (or even twice a day) this product is for you.  Previous to this, I&#x27;ve owned a cheaper panasonic shaver which did a decent job, but I was unimpressed.  This product changed my perception of electronic shavers.  It shaves as close as a blade without the need to go over and over aress for a complete shave.  The Linear 13,000 rpm motor is all that it claims to be...and the pivoting head rocks.  I also have highly sensitive skin and the wet capability keeps it from getting irritated.  This product is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have shaved with a Gillette razor for the last 21 years. I have suffered with razor burn, in grown hairs and cuts. I tried a rotary razor and that was nothing short of torture. When I heard about the Panasonic wet dry razor, and read the Amazon reviews I rolled the dice and bought one.   As of today I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and I am in love with it! They say it takes 30 days to get your beard to adjust to the razor but just after 3 days I&#x27;m 80% there.   Tough beard? I&#x27;ve got the toughest. I have a thick beard with course hair. The hair also likes to grow close to the skin so I&#x27;ve been especially susceptible to cuts, razor burn and in grown hair. On top of that my beard grows in 4 different directions. I never thought I could get away from scraping but this Shaver is the best.   What works for me so far is to use Shaving creme, not gel, and put a thin layer on. Just enough to lubricate. I shave after I get out of the shower. I&#x27;ve tried it in the shower but get better results in front of the mirror.      The features are good. Very quick charge, nice design ergonomically, I like the turbo clean mode as well. You can clean this under the faucet with soap. The cleaner stand can be used 1x wk. I highly recommend this Shaver to anyone trying to get away from shaving with a razor.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever used... and I have tried a lot. Great buy at $60.00 - a no brainer.</li>
    <li> Dont get carried away by the fact that if its a costly electric shaver, it can replace your existing razors.     NO IT CANT ...    so get a cheap trimmer which u can use only for trimming as this shaver cannot do anything good other than trimming...which just a simple 10 buck trimmer can do ...     I had burns/cuts etc using this shaver ...     Dont go for it !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve allways used Panasonic shaving systems, but the ES81685 it&#x27;s the greatest, smooth, very fast and it&#x27;s ergonomic shape makes, every shaving, a fantastic experience. I recomended.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my 77 year old husband..and he was so thrilled.  His old Norelco was falling apart.  He could not believe How Fast this razor is and what a good job it does.  He thanked me profusely, and I said.....well, You paid for it!  He laughed.......good old credit card.....  Jan</li>
    <li> Great razor, though a little expensive. It takes some time to get used to using it, as I missed some rather long hairs on my neck the first few times. Very easy to clean, and I rinse it out a few times between cleanings. I break out a lot less often because of this rasor. Best bet is to read the manual, and get used to it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GD3S14 Panasonic ES8168S Men&#x27;s Vortex Hydra Clean System with Convex Cutting System]]    My Mother wanted to get My Dad a new electric razor for his Birthday.    The old one just did not shave close enough for him.      I went online and read many reviews of different shavers.    I found this one.  My Dad absolutely loves this shaver.  It shaves closer than any other that he has tried.  I shopped around to get a good price and with the coupons I found online, Mother got a good deal!    As soon as I took it over to them, Dad opened and charged it.  He used it immediately and we could hear it cut hairs even though he had already shaved earlier with his old razor.  It cut even closer!    I would recommend this shaver to everyone.  If it is good enough for MY DAD, then it is good enough for your Dad too.</li>
    <li> I will try to keep this short and to the point...  Was a razor guy, tried a few Braun razors 6-10 years ago.  Went back to the razors and was just tired of getting the cuts, nicks and terrible razor burn on my neck.    I used to shave in the shower with standard Mach3 razors...shower steam helped the razor burn, but still had a tough time with it quite often.  My wife and I discussed it and we read all the reviews and MAN am I glad I got this razor.     I have had NO nicks or cuts and have NO razor burn at all.  I still shave in the shower with Neutrogena shave cream (like a cream) and love the way the razor shaves.  Comfortable to hold, very quiet, comfortable on my face and \\&quot;flexible\\&quot; enough to get those impossible spots under your jaw bone on your neck.    The cleaning and charging system is great.  Simple ad fairly quick.  I charge/clean it on Saturday nights and it is fully charged for the whole week with plenty of battery left over...could maybe make 2 weeks if I had to.    2 THUMBS up on this one...</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for a Christmas gift. What a wonderful success. He works out of the office at home so he will take it there to work and shave in the morning. When traveling he just packs the charged razor. He comments that it is so much easier and closer. There is a slight time to get use to shaving with electric verse a regular razor but so well worth it. I also got one for my son who is in the army stationed in Afghanistan where they have limited water, he is thrilled with it. Says he isn&#x27;t shaving with cold water and no mirror.</li>
    <li> I converted from a blade to this shaver about 5 years ago.  As the blade dulls it&#x27;s not quite as close as a blade, but a lot easier to use and doesn&#x27;t cut my chin.  I keep this shaver in my shower.  Works very good wet.</li>
    <li> Wow! I have used many different brands of electric shavers over the years but decided that Panasonic was worth a try as they sell many high quality products. This new Panasonic is simply incredible. It follows the contours of my face and does an unbelievable job of giving me the closest most comfrtable shave I have ever experienced. It is quiet and the battery life is exceptional and the water based cleaning and drying system keeps it clean and dry and makes it feel brand new every time I use it. This item really is a terrific example of what I feel is the best shaver available on the market. If it were possible to rate it higher than 5 stars I most certainly would!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor based on good research and reading various numbers of reviews. Having owned two Norelco razors (with the circular-pivot blades), I was extremely skeptical about spending money to purchase another. After all, these electric shavers are not cheap. I purchased my first Norelco while in the military and I would always get in trouble for not shaving \\&quot;properly\\&quot;. I then purchased a second Norelco a few years later with the notion that \\&quot;maybe the newer models would work better\\&quot;.  The second razor was a little better than my first, but it still left many hairs untouched. Now, almost ten years after purchasing my first shaver, I decided to give electric razors a third and final chance.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic unit is constructed very well. One of the main reasons I chose the Panasonic unit was because it gave me the ability to \\&quot;wet shave\\&quot; (even allowing the use of shaving cream). The shaver is a bit loud (louder than both my Norelco shavers), but not loud enough to hurt your ears or disturb someone in the next room. It is better to shave after showering (or while showering), since our facial hairs are softest then. I applied a thin (it has to be thin for the razor to work properly) layer of shaving cream, crossed my fingers, turned on my shaver, and shaved away. The shaver glided effortlessly across my face without pulling or irritating. I splashed water on my face to clean it away after only shaving half of it. I was completely astonished at how well the shaver had performed. It shaved as close as my Mach III manual razor, but without the irritation. Cleaning the shaver was easy. You can choose to auto clean it with the supplied cleaning system, but I opted for the manual cleaning method (since purchasing the cleaning cartridges can get expensive).  I cannot comment on durability or long term reliability because this review is based on my first use. Needless to say, I am very pleased with my purchase. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Have  owned this razor system for about two weeks. It really DOES THE JOB !!! When used with shaving cream, it provides a very smooth shave. When used in the dry mode, the shave is very good. I have a very tough, fast growing beard, and I really enjoy using this razor. &lt;br /&gt;Clean-up is  a breeze. Everything is done automatic, and the razor is fresh and clean, for the next use. &lt;br /&gt;There is nothing like this! I usually buy a new electric razor every two-years,and they do a horrible job. &lt;br /&gt;The detergent will last up to 40 days, so it is realatively inexpensive to use. The motor is not loud. &lt;br /&gt;The razor certainly justifies the price, over the long haul. The razor and unit are very sturdy and should last for a long time.</li>
    <li> Before buying this shaver, I read most of the reviews listed here. They were helpful in allowing me to make the best decision I could. Where the reviews were positive (and there were many) they were helpful, to say the least. Where they were negative (there were a couple) they were trite in their complaints. This is a great shaver. Works excellent on my mug.    And that&#x27;s just the thing, every one of us is different and will not likely experience the same exact results. I can not recommend this shaver enough. For me, it shaves extremely close. I can not use a blade daily as they rip my face to shreds, regardless of the shave cream used. This is the first shaver that did not give me red bumps on my neck...a blessing in itself.    The self-cleaning feature is neat, I use it about once every charging period. It&#x27;s not overly noisy, it takes care of itself and is no hassle to use.    When using these reviews, do take the positives as your lead. The negatives, as I mentioned were all trite complaints. This is a shaver, not a deep-space probe. It works perfect for me, and if you have sensitive skin you will be able to shave daily without any irritation. Would I like for this shaver to have been less expensive? Sure. But I&#x27;d also like the new Ferrari 599 to be less expensive, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath. Sometimes, you must pay for quality...    Great job, Panasonic!  Great job, Amazon!    EXCELLENT JOB, all who took the time to review this product. THANK YOU!    Cheers!</li>
    <li> This is a good product, quiet, close and very smooth.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that the display flashes when charging.  If left on the counter in the bathroom at night the flash will light up the hall.  Buy the same unit without the fancy display, save some money and you don&#x27;t have to deal with the display!!!</li>
