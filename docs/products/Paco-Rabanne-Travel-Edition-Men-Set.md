<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> On time I receive the item in Colombia, without damage, and good quality</li>
    <li> I first smelled this in a Playboy magazine and I thought it smelled good. I bought it and the first time I used it I felt like I had used a womans perfume. Very feminine smelling. They say that the women will love it, thats because they want to wear it. I would not recommend wasting your money on this \\&quot;cologne\\&quot;. If you want a masculine smell avoid this all together. Watch out for fakes. The serial number imprinted on the bottom of the box should match the serial number on the glass part of the bottle.</li>
    <li> This is really awesomeeeeeeeee.</li>
    <li> Hello Good Morning, perfume has a spectacular scent, the fragrance is strong recommend it is very good, their size is normal and may last for months depending on use.</li>
    <li> Those who say the smell is not masculine are moronic, it&#x27;s a sweet smell but still very manly, I have tried out all different types of cologne and I have been complimented more on this cologne than all the others I have ever worn combined! Buy you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne I first saw it on Carnival cruise ship last year. I actually brought the women&#x27;s perfume for my wife and later found out that they have a men&#x27;s cologne and this has gotten me plenty of compliments. Guys if u looking for a good scent this I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this perfume on Manday after Thanksgiving. I saw this perfume been offered for half price and free deliver. I got crazy with the deal because it was exatcly what my dad wanted for a wonderful price. They said that it will be delived in 5-8 days, but for my surprise, I got it at my door Wednesday. Only 3 days after my purchase. I got so happy! The package was well done, so the box and the perfume arrived in excelent conditions. The perfume is great and now I want to try the new lady million.</li>
    <li> Perfume Excellent, 100% recommended,the best ever</li>
    <li> seller please tell me, what a difference between EDT and EDC ?  and please tell me is this product ORIGINAL? :) thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been poking around to find a nice cologne to get my boyfriend for Christmas.. least to say I bought him something different, and bought this for me. No joke! I considered getting this for him, but I think the scent is a little more on the sweet side. I prefer it better on me than I do on him. Call me crazy, that&#x27;s okay, but this is what I prefer. My advice to the guys out there that haven&#x27;t smelled this in person first... please try it on in person first! It smells like mens cologne don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I wont lie that it does have a hint of something feminine in here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it. I wear it. That&#x27;s my two cents.</li>
    <li> Loved the product, I gave this to my Son for a Christmas gift!</li>
    <li> Authentic.&lt;br /&gt;It was worth every penny spent and it was alot cheaper than what I could get it for here.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> nice wife loves it i&#x27;m innn</li>
    <li> This Spray stays on you the whole day and I can&#x27;t count how many comments I&#x27;ve received using this product. Recommend for men, it&#x27;ll surely get the attention of the ladies.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and is worth the money.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly, all good.</li>
    <li> I sampled 1 million in a perfume store and said to myself: WOW! I gotta have this. And I decided to buy it for myself as a Christmas gift. Amazingly, I received it as a gift just one week later. You can imagine my reaction.&lt;br /&gt;This is really an amazing perfume, very sweet. You will smell just like a fresh, luxurious sugar cane (and I mean a real sugar cane, the tropical plant). The first notes will blow your mind away, and I just wish tjey where the most lasting ones.&lt;br /&gt;But wait, this isn&#x27;t the best part... I&#x27;ve been using 1 Million for a couple of weeks now (one of the only one to wear it around in my town) an I finally got to experience what people were feeling around me and when they tell me I smelled GREAT. Yesterday morning, I went back to my room to pick some forgotten thing (I don&#x27;t even remember) and when I entered the bedroom: POW! WOOWW! OOHH! AHH! I feel like I&#x27;m in Heaven, floating.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, you gotta have this in your collection.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars tough, because it doen&#x27;t last as long as I would like it to.</li>
    <li> this was ok  I liked Paco Rabanne, but I was disappointed in the gold I really thought I would like it more.</li>
    <li> I actually spelt this cologne on someone while stationed in the Middle East.  It was the softest manly cologne i have ever smelt; the others have the musky/robust smell. The mildness lingered on after he left the room, so i ordered a bottle for my husband.  I am still in the Middle Easr and have not had the opportunity to experience the exzuberant sent on him, but when i do get home, i will definitely have him wear it every day; who knows, maybe at night as well.  SMILE - The name fits the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phyllis</li>
    <li> This cologne is amazing.  Very clean, light and attractive scent.  Everytime my boyfriend sprays it, I&#x27;m hypnotized!  Best cologne since cool water.</li>
    <li> Well I thought this colone will be the best of the best, but just look like, in that&lt;br /&gt;Gold presentation look very good. My wife told me she didn&#x27;t like and other people too&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t hear any good commend. Thanks</li>
    <li> I discovered this scent in Lake Placid New York last fall and got lots of compliments on it and wore the bottle out reordered it from Amazon and received even more compliments. Effusive compliments from men who don&#x27;t usually even wear cologne. Very nice, great buy and it is a long lasting scent it doesn&#x27;t seem to fade.</li>
    <li> Great scent, lasts for a very long time. Lots of compliments</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great.</li>
    <li> It Smell Very good, it worth the price!</li>
    <li> To me, this is a unisex scent...it could easily be for a man or a woman. However, the fragrance is spicy and kind of gross, so I don&#x27;t recommend it for either gender.</li>
    <li> It was great working with this guy. he gave me the best service anyone can ever have when purchasing a product online. ant the product was 100% genuine, it smelled niiiice</li>
    <li> I HAVE HAD THIS AND 5 BOTTLES OF PERFUME AND THIS LAST ONE BUY IT AT AMAZON FOR MY ONE FOR MY BROTHER AND DECEPTION THE TRUTH THAT IS FALSE PERFUME NOT LAST BECAUSE THE SMELL IS NOT THE SAME 30minutes SMELL SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT LINKED WITH AS POSSIBLE TO AMAZON STORE CAN SELL FAKE PRODUCTS, I premiered it this week and makes me very angry TRUTH AND I CAN NOT ASK ME FOR THE TIME AMAZON TO REFUND MY MONEY IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THIS STORE OF ITS VENDORS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YO HE TENIDO YA 5 FRASCOS DE ESTE PERFUME Y ESTE ULTIMO LO COMPRE EN AMAZON UNO PARA MI UNO PARA MI HERMANO Y DE VERDAD QUE DECEPCION EL PERFUME ES FALSO PUES EL OLOR NO DURA 30MINUTOS NO ES EL MISMO OLOR ESTO FUE LIGADO CON ALGO NO ES POSIBLE QUE UNA TIENDA COMO AMAZON PUEDA VENDER PRODUCTOS FALSOS, YO LO ESTRENE ESTA SEMANA Y DE VERDAD ME DA MUCHA RABIA YA QUE NO PUEDO POR EL TIEMPO PEDIR ME REINTEGREN MI DINERO AMAZON DEBE RETIRAR ESTA TIENDA INMEDIATAMENTE DE SUS VENDEDORES</li>
    <li> Very nice packaging and fragrance bottle but this is not so much for men, the women&#x27;s version has much more quality, ie, it smells much better!</li>
    <li> he loves the smell of this cologne. Packaging was fine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m french, it was my Fragance in France and it&#x27;s hard to find it in US, it&#x27;s the 1st men Fragance in My Home Country ! And it&#x27;s smell soooo Good</li>
    <li> Always been a Paco wearer</li>
    <li> It has a great enticing smell that just overwhelms the senses; the smell its self last for several days and stays strong( I sprayed some on a shirt and left it in my living room). Its a very strong but smooth smell that dose not push away but instead drives others to get close. This is another great smell for a MAN, women i think you&#x27;ll very happy if your significant other starts wearing this and men should consider it if they are looking for something new.&lt;br /&gt;Side not: I wear this with L&#x27;Homme by Yves Saint Laurent and it creates a very sensual, twist of pure smoothness with a lasting erotic sensation, Women do love it.&lt;br /&gt;(Product for MEN)</li>
    <li> excellent perfume, soft with a pleasant scent, I recommend it to anyone with a good taste in men perfums! my favorite</li>
    <li> it was fake and so obvious that it was refilled or they might added some water. I used to wear one Million and I know exactly what is the smell and how long it stays. the 1 million that I bought from here stays for not more than 5 min and it doesn&#x27;t even smell like the real 1 Million. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> When I read that Tiesto uses 1 Million I was sold. Immediately went to Sephora and got it. Impulse purchase at its purest as Zizek would say. It smelled quite fresh and nice. At the store. Somewhat sophisticated, somewhat simple. However, since then I have been completely disappointed by the longevity of the smell. I am comparing to CK Euphoria and various Azzaros and it is dead last. By the time I am at work, I cannot sense any note, while with any other spray I can sense it throughout the whole day. If I spray 1 Million on my wrist it takes only a couple of minutes and there is hardly any trace of it. Since this was from Sephora I am not willing to dismiss it is as a fake copy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I am not willing to just throw it, because this was the most I have given for a smell. CK is my number one in terms of value/price. By far.</li>
    <li> Great product. It was delivered super fast and in excellent quality! The fragance is as it should. I have purchased this perfume before at the store and this one is an original version. Thank you!!! I look foward to buy more from this seller ;-)</li>
    <li> 1 Million cologne, coupled with the deodorant, is a fragarance that seems to elicit positive responses whenever I wear it.  A moderate to light fresh scent, it also is versitile enough to wear at a club, concert or board room presentation.  I would also classify it as a four season fragarance, and it is light enough for the summer.  A bit spendy, but the reception seems worth the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s defiantly an ideal gift, that I got from my wife once. Then I bought it again. It has unique smell, so many people what I&#x27;m wearing from time to time :).</li>
    <li> Bought this two months ago as a gift for my dad...man, is this THE best or what...it really gives a strong masculine vibe...I was so jealous of him that wanted to buy one for myself, but my fiance told me that it is for 40+ and she is right...it is really mature.</li>
    <li> It is really nice, I liked it very much and i can recomend who wants to buy it...</li>
    <li> Someone recommended this product to me and although I like to stick to my traditional perfumes, I decided to try this and did not regret it. I will definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Do not buy..its fake the smell fades away just after short period being used.I bought one and i do regret it.</li>
    <li> The smell lasts all day and is very pleasant</li>
    <li> I think this is a good cologne for winter time , but for summer it can be little bit strong...</li>
    <li> My husband wears it and it smells amazing on him. So this is the reason why I purchased the product.</li>
    <li> Go ahead and buy right now.  You will be back writing a positive review as I am.  Amazing notes, very different and sure to please.</li>
    <li> This has a long long lasting appeal as the fragrance lasts for a long time unlike cheap colognes which die out in hours to minutes.</li>
    <li> entrega al d&amp;iacute;a mercanc&amp;iacute;a en buen estado responsables los productos que uno compra son los que env&amp;iacute;an tal cual como se hace el pedido</li>
    <li> Whenever i wear this...EVERYONE wants to know what i have on.  By far my favorite and i live the smell!!</li>
    <li> wonderful, super, marvelous scent. there is no need to say something about this cologne. I strongly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Simply the best men&#x27;s fragrance out there! My wife loves it and the compliments never end.. I&#x27;ve been told I smell like a million dollars and when asked the name of the fragrance i replied \\&quot;ONE MILLION\\&quot; lol funny but true. Genuine Authentic Product. Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> This is one of those fragrances that only works for certain people. My friend used to wear this as his everyday and I never liked it, it always went very sour on him and I really didn&#x27;t feel it suited. I&#x27;d recommend it highly as a daily scent, but be sure to test a spray on yourself and leave it on all day before deciding, it might not suit you.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it and I think it&#x27;s a very good scent</li>
    <li> I saw a review from a YouTuber about this perfume and I decided.. Why not?  The scent is addictive!  I bought the 3.4oz size and might or might not share it with my fiance.  I sprayed it up in the air and walked into it and the scent is lasting.  I received wondering looks from men and women on the train (Bronx). Luv it!!! Received this order in one day.  Will order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Women can&#x27;t get enough of the scent</li>
    <li> I love the scent of 1 Million! Has a masculine yet sweet note to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle is also nice and sturdy ( i did drop it once and it didn&#x27;t shatter)  it is not cheap but I think it is worth it.</li>
    <li> One of the best perfumes I&#x27;ve used. Very clean, light and attractive scent. My wife gets hypnotized each time I use.</li>
    <li> This men&#x27;s cologne has a decadent rich scent. A little goes a long way. My son loves it and wears it everyday.</li>
    <li> Will have you smelling like a Million Bucks.</li>
    <li> Bought for son&#x27;s birthday present.  He loved it.</li>
    <li> My daddy love this perfum</li>
    <li> Great smell day or night</li>
    <li> This item was great and sent in a decent amount of time, thanks!!!</li>
    <li> This is definitely a great scent, as it has been said in other reviews this scent definitely changes as the day goes on. In any case I would really recommend buying it from Amazon only (or from a seller that has really good standings). I bought other copies of it and it was clear that they where fake therefore, I&#x27;m only buying this kind of products from Amazon.</li>
    <li> After testing several new scents, I came across this. I used to wear Cool Water or Reaction, but this smell is stronger, and by far gets more compliments and close encounters from women than the others!</li>
    <li> Great cologne for a night out on the town.  This is a cologne that will be noticed; there&#x27;s nothing subtle about it.  May be a little too strong for daytime, but definitely pleasant and lasting.  You will have people ask you what you&#x27;re wearing.  It&#x27;s strength, to me, is as strong as Angel for men... but it is definitely completely different.</li>
    <li> Great perfume smell so good I love</li>
    <li> This brand is popular for strong fragrances and this is no different, I prefer fragrances that have a fresh smell (like Aqua di gio, D &amp; G blue, etc) this one is different, I don&#x27;t know how to describe it but it is unlike any other Men&#x27;s fragrance I have used, it is strong though and I got asked a couple of times what I was wearing :-)  The bottle too is unlike anything else.  I recommend it but it won&#x27;t be the first on my list, Prada Infusion or Prada by Prada are much better</li>
    <li> The bottle of the parfume was broken and it was not full. (one third of the bottle was empty). There were stains on the bottle. I guess it has been like that for a long time. I am sure it didnt get broken during the shipping. the package was quite protective. I believe it was even broken before they sent it to me!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice scent for women to wear but not men. If however you do choose to wear it only apply 1 spray to the back of knee area, otherwise it will be nauseating all day for you and others around you. It smells good when you try it in the store on a paper strip, but when it hits the skin it transforms to a girly scent. This is a good scent at a concert or any place where you will sweat alot.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money in my opinion</li>
    <li> smell fades away after 20 -30 minutes being used like cheap deodorant spray . feel very disappointed with this..dON&#x27;T buy it</li>
    <li> It was everything I expected and my fianc&amp;eacute; smelled great!</li>
    <li> This Edt has a very distinct smell that makes u stand out. A bit strong but not overpowering. This definitely has a clean and fresh smell, but I would not describe it as smelling like &amp;#34;bubble gum&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;toothpaste&amp;#34; like some have. I would say its has bit of a flower aroma mixed with a clean soap smell. It has strong undertones which makes me highly disagree with people that say it smells like a woman&#x27;s perfume. This starts off strong and smoothly rolls off after a few hours (maybe not as long as I would like it to). Otherwise I highly recommend this and if you buy it, expect compliments!</li>
    <li> I work at a fragrances counter in a department store in the US and we just started carrying this fragrance (we had a lot of European men ask for it in the last few years!). I&#x27;m glad we did. I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it - the bottle&#x27;s presentation made me expect something gaudy and simplistic from the scent. I should have known better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the mint in the top notes really stands out, and so does the vanilla-smooth leather in the bottom. The middle spice notes make it really shine, though. Spice in a cologne gets me every time. I can&#x27;t smell the rose as strongly, and I don&#x27;t mention it to my customers - I think a lot of American men would shy away from a \\&quot;girly\\&quot; note like rose in their cologne. I wouldn&#x27;t classify this as a really sweet scent, but then I&#x27;ve smelled Angel and that&#x27;s entirely vanilla-chocolate-cookie-dough... sugary sweet! There&#x27;s nothing sweet about Million in comparison. If you -can- smell the rose notes, you might get that sweetness that I&#x27;m missing. Everyone smells something different in a cologne!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first thought was that this cologne was a lot like the new Gucci Guilty with its spice and woody/vanilla notes, but Guilty is a deeper, heavier scent with cardamom instead of cinnamon and much different top notes. I like Million better and am considering trying it out on my husband, who&#x27;s picky with his scents. I think he&#x27;ll like it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to buy on Amazon, buy from a reputable seller and get the large size. The 3.4oz EDT retails for $75 at my store; anything much cheaper is almost guaranteed to be a refilled bottle, damaged, or fake. Cologne is expensive, yes, but a 3.4oz bottle should last you a year or more depending on how often you use. My husband sprays his 3.4oz Armani Code liberally on a daily basis, and after 8-9 months it&#x27;s still half full! If we&#x27;d gotten the smaller one it would have cost us over $50 and we&#x27;d be replacing it already. I&#x27;d say the larger size is definitely worth the investment.</li>
    <li> excelent fragance, i just love it, stays all day long, for day &amp; night use, very cool bottle, if you dont like sweet parfums forget about this one... came parfectly selaed, in box &amp; on time shipping... RECOMENDED FRAGANCE</li>
    <li> I love this cologne!!</li>
    <li> I spray each wrist and one spray each side of neck, does not seem to project too strongly for me, I do like the spicy/bubblegum like scent, as have others though they have to get up close to be able to get a whiff of it on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is really nice and stands out, but its sprayer seems poor. Instead of a mist spray that most of my colognes give me this one seems closer to a squirt most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really interesting scent though!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an individual who likes to make a good first impression, and in order to achieve that you have to look and sound good. However I never knew that smelling good made an incredible difference. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now and not to sound like a jerk or anything but females love it. It just takes 3 sprays and your set for the night and next morning..at her place! hahhah.</li>
    <li> FRAGANCE ENDURENCE IS INCREDIBLE EVEN AFTER I WASH MY HANDS, I LOVE PACO RABANNER %100 GENUINE</li>
    <li> I love this and it has quickly become one of my favorite colognes to wear.  I just really like the smell and I have gotten many compliments when I wear it.  I became aware of it through one of those fall out inserts and instead of pitching it I checked it out, it was very suprising to me how much I just took to it and ordered it online the next day.  No one can say what will work for you but I would highly recommend this, get a sample next time at the mall and try and then order here and save a few bucks it is worth it.  I am so glad I tried this out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great buy.. I bought this for my hubby for valentines day!! It&#x27;s very strong and masculine fragrance and it says for very long.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s bit expensive especially for someone like me who always tries to find the best with the least price possible but if you are looking to buy or gift someone special for a special occasion I would highly recommend it. You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this fragrance.</li>
    <li> excellent product recommend 100%</li>
    <li> Este es el mejor perfume Paco Rabanne que he tenido, y es el mejor de todos, tiene una fijacion excelente que dura horas y horas, inclusive luego de ducharte sigues sintiendo el aroma en el agua. Es la joya de Paco Rabanne, apenas se me agote lo volvere a comprar, 100% seguro.</li>
    <li> very good high quality</li>
    <li> Received item very fast and this smells SO good. Long lasting fragrance also</li>
    <li> I like the perfume, it was a gift for my dad. The only thing is that the delivery took a little longer than what I expected, but still came on time, since I had bought it in advance.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing. Reminds me of bubble gum and leather with some cinnamon in there.  Always a compliment getter. The haters will say what they want but this stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> I wore this cologne on a job interview and within my first fifteen minutes there, I had two women compliment me on it.  The receptionist who called the hiring manager to tell her that I was there told her to \\&quot;not make him wait because he smells so good.\\&quot;  That was a very nice compliment and I adore this cologne.  Over the last three or four years, I&#x27;ve started getting big into cologne and right now I have seven different kinds and this is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sephora Scent Book describes its tones as: beginning invitingly with grapefruit, mint and blood mandarin, the middle notes are composed of rose absolute, cinnamon and spices and finally the finishing notes are the ultimate velvet harmony of leather, white wood, amber and Indonesian patchouli.  There are a lot of great scents out there and this is unquestionably one of them.</li>
    <li> This has got to be some of the best smelling cologne I have ever smelled.Lasts a long time too.Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Very nice fragrance and people notice ask &amp;#34;what are you wearing&amp;#34;. They want to purchase it.</li>
    <li> This was Valentine gift for my boyfriend &amp; he loved it ! He says it smells like money . I will buy more</li>
    <li> Good price for the amount of cologne. Love the packaging as well. Smells great.Very strong but not overpowering.  Love it</li>
    <li> Great product.. best of the best.. and the best important, the woman loved..!  very nice, I recomended  this product if you want to smell good</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments. Its become my signature smell.</li>
    <li> It arrive quickly and Smells amazing on my BF!</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND LOVE THIS GIFT, I WAS ABLE TO FIND THIS ITEM IN AMAZON , THE PRICE WAS JUST GOOD FOR ME. THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Love it, I got the perfume to give to my boyfriend and he loves too.I recommended to you that likes strong perfumes.</li>
    <li> This one is good and stays for a whole day.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this perfum. The price is little bit high but it is worthy. My brother is even asking for it he cannot afford it.</li>
    <li> I started wearing Paco Rabane 1 Million in 2011; long before it became popular in the US.  I immediately loved the unusual fragrance that had already taken Europe by storm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2013 you can&#x27;t go into a single department store without seeing a display of this distinctive fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to wax lyrical about the way it smells.  It is certainly interesting from beginning to end, at each stage of the dry down and fade it has something to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is an evening fragrance for younger men and certainly more date night than board room.  I&#x27;ve had plenty of compliments about it.  There has to be a reason why this did so well in Europe and is now taking the US by storm.  The only downside is that with the amount they are selling now, it&#x27;s not as unique as it once was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying from Amazon certainly saved me a lot of money over some of the store prices.  But this is quality stuff and will last a long time.  I&#x27;ve already refilled a couple of times.</li>
    <li> This stuff is POTENT.  Use very sparingly.  It has an amazing scent - the only drawback is that it is so popular.  You will not smell very unique.  If you dont care about that, then this is a great choice.  If you love the smell of this stuff (like I do), but you want to add a twist, it works great in combination with other softer colognes (esp. floral based ones).  I sometimes spray on a small amount of 1 Million, then apply something like Acqua Di Parma Colonia.  It really brings out the floral notes of the ADP while also keeping the overbearing nature of 1 Million in check a little bit.  Experiment for yourself.  Or wear it by itself.  This stuff is amazing.  And lasts forever - I can even smell it after taking a shower.</li>
    <li> Wow! Very nice. Smell like a million $$$$</li>
    <li> Before I got this perfume, I didn&#x27;t read thro all the comments. Now that i&#x27;m doing it (after buy), I can see theres sometime where you will probably get a fake one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this perfume can last so little... after 15-20 mins I can barely feel the smell of it. Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last any long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d really like to return it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful the &amp;iacute;tem is so good and was the same thanks for the good quality .&lt;br /&gt;very good &amp;iacute;tem.  Very good!!!</li>
    <li> I owned this one before and thats why i had to get it again. Smells great and most importantly women love it :)</li>
    <li> ladies always ...always compliment me on this scent ... i wear it to bed so i had to spend on the big bottle ..i dont think i will ever use another cologne again.. this was my second choice after david beckhams midnight was discontinued</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I recommend it</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery. A free bonus is awesome too. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Awesome cologne! 1 Million is definitely now one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> the box is a little bend and the seal was broken too. I don&#x27;t know what to think. It is confusing</li>
    <li> Got a million good responses to this product i will keep some from now on thanks mr rabanne your the man !</li>
    <li> One of the best smelling colognes I own.</li>
    <li> Make sure it&#x27;s what you want. Once you get it your&#x27;re stuck with it. Amazon does not allow returns on cologne. Funny they don&#x27;t state that on any of these cologne pages!</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as my Boucheron !!</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my husband and I really like how smells.  Have great durability on his clothes after some days.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best perfume ever made. What a beautiful masterpiece. I get one million compliments. Women love it. They come like bees on flowers. I always have some 6.8 oz bottles on reserve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;Projection: 10/10</li>
    <li> Just What I expected, recommended. (Can use it at any time, ppl really enjoy how this smell..!)</li>
    <li> Actions speak louder than words and the action of this cologne is how many people notice the scent and the man wearing it.</li>
    <li> This is one the best smelling cologne I have ever come across.. It was a nice gift for hubby... Hubby loved it..</li>
    <li> Best smelling cologne</li>
    <li> I received product, but the container was dented from before shipping and it squirts out very little at a time. I will not order from them again. you can tell that the damage to the spray was not due to shipping but must of fallen which is why it was sold for a reasonable price</li>
    <li> the price was great with the size. this was one of my gifts for my husband and he loves it!!!</li>
    <li> This cologne is a must-have!!! I bought it for my husband and he absolutely loves it. This scents lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This scent is the most amazing smell. I LOVE it when I smell it on someone. I bought it for my boyfriend, and wear it more than he does. The womans scent is also amazing. If you are considering this scent, CONSIDER NO MORE, BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> My wife loves the way it smells.</li>
    <li> Probably the best smelling cologne i ever owned! Women love it!</li>
    <li> I was told from a friend that this is worth a million so im trying it i like the smell my self havent recieved a complement yet tho</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD MENS COLOGNE WILL BUY AND TELL OTHER ABOUT IT MY FAMILY LOVE IT &amp; I DO TO  THANKS</li>
    <li> Lots of compliments when I where this!</li>
    <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described. Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
    <li> I get good to excellent weather</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care much for the smell. It&#x27;s almost like a zesty spice. However everyone&#x27;s ph is different, so for me It&#x27;s not the one. Received it very quick. I give them credit there.</li>
    <li> It has a unique smell. I like it. Not my favorite but in my top 5</li>
    <li> Very good quality product. Excellent presentation shipping</li>
    <li> I liked it so far for this price not bad the smell is good I received the parfum on time</li>
    <li> Great price. Smells very nice.</li>
    <li> very good I recommend it</li>
    <li> This perfume smells really good, I love when my boy use it, because is not too strong or soft, is just perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the authenticity of this fragrance which I bought directly from Amazon, the scent it&#x27;s not as strong as the one I tried at Sephora, and this is the second of many fragrances that I have bought from Amazon that I have this issue with. ( the other one is Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier.. This one that I bought from Amazon perhaps it&#x27;s an old batch that the scent is not as strong as when it was brand new and that&#x27;s why the price was cheaper here on Amazon, I really don&#x27;t know, what I do know is that the serial number on the bottom of the bottle was scratched off and unreadable...why would Amazon accept or sell something like this ? I don&#x27;t know, it still smells OK ( not as good as the one at Sephora ) , and not as strong nor with as much projection as the one I tried at Sephora, so it leaves me wondering and I probably won&#x27;t buy this fragrance again from Amazon...I did like very much the 1 million I tried at Sephora, that one is ideal for Winter/Night clubbing... A projection beast, If you decide to buy it  just make sure you get the original, or at least not an old batch like I&#x27;m afraid happened to me here at Amazon and go buy it in person as there is no returns for fragrances here on Amazon; The only down side to this fragrance would be that it&#x27;s so liked and popular that perhaps others will be wearing it too.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love the smell on my man, it&#x27;s just not strong enough.</li>
    <li> The best perfume I &#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> Excellent, I really like this perfume.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Get a lot of compliments on it. Doesn&#x27;t smell like money though. Buy it, wear it, dance in it....</li>
    <li> The fragance smell nice but it isn&#x27;t hard and disapears  in  less than an hour  I don&#x27;t know why  .</li>
    <li> This has a wonderful scent. The prefect solution for my husband who likes to put on too much. It never is overpowering.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne on the reviews alone as a gift for my uncle. It smells as wonderful as everyone has described. I love it so much that I&#x27;m going to buy it for my husband. Ladies you want this for your man. It is a nice all day cologne and goes from day to night seamlessly.</li>
    <li> This smells so good! I got it early!</li>
    <li> I would have to say this is my favorite scent right now.  A very close second is Ed Hardy Born Wild.  I have been on a buying spree with colognes lately.  One important thing I have noticed is that if you can find a gift set for the cologne you like, that the Gift set cost the same or slightly more than just the single bottle itself.  I am all about getting the best deal, there are a number of things that you can do with the extras.  You can gift the extras to friends or relatives.  This makes perfect sense to me, especially if you would not normally spend $75 on a coworker&#x27;s gift, but an giving an extra away is like giving a gift for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked the difference between cologne and EDT and found out some interesting stuff.  To be honest I thought cologne was stronger than EDT and that is not correct.  I know I have bottles of cologne that are 30 years old and are stronger than 1 million edt or at least last a lot longer. (Yes, they have evaporated slightly, but they used to last longer 30 years ago too)  An example is Polo lasted all day on me and still does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is part of an Article I found via google:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eau De Cologne (EDC)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is often referred to just as Cologne and has the greatest dilution of fragrances with a 3-5% concentration of perfume essence, lasting up to 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Men Eau De Toilette (EDT)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has the greatest concentration of essence generally available for men and hence lasts the longest, up to 5 hours. It is often available in either a splash or a spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is where body chemistry takes a part in this.  My example of Polo lasting on me all day should not happen according to this article, but it does.  My thought is that 1 million does not react the same to my heat or body chemistry as the other colognes (EDT) I wear.  Just a theory.  I heard all of the negatives about this scent is the lack of staying power.  To be honest if it did not cost this much I would not have a problem with it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me I feel if you like the scent I don&#x27;t see the longevity of the scent being the show stopper.  For me it lasts over 1/2 a day and that is what the above article suggests an EDT should last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my set from Sephora (linked through amazon)  I see a few sellers that save you a few dollars over Amazon that are linked right here.  Seriously people you really need to save $5 on a $75 bottle of Cologne and get it from an unknown seller?  Look at the real negative reviews.....it&#x27;s not hard to find one that says, watered down scent, bottle 1/2 full, bottle broken or they sent me a tester.  Even if you get your money back you have to PAY for shipping back and all the hassle that comes with dealing with returning something that was not as advertised.  Keep in mind if you get your money back from a linked seller you do not get shipping they charge to ship it to you back. I can take a purchase from Sephora online right back to JCpenny&#x27;s  and with Amazon THEY will pay for the return if the order is not right/damaged.  Trust me I looked and looked and looked, I found no real deals on cologne that where not outright scams and hassles.  If the deal sounds too good to be true then it probably is.  Do yourself a favor and look for the gift set (I could only find at Sephora online) and pay the extra $3 and get a great deal.feel if you like the scent I don&#x27;t see the longevity of the scent being the show stopper.

    <li> The perfume arived but it only had half of the content...also the smell seems diferent than the original perfume... I feel very disappointed with this, I will never buy a perfume here..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so nice aroma of this perfume my wife said I was not going to let out only if used this perfume. Then he told me he was joking .... It&#x27;s a great price for the product you get ..&lt;br /&gt;I leave because I&#x27;m going out alone ... just kidding</li>

    <li> The scent is strong and nice. I get a lot of compliment all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Last for 3~6 hrs (strong) and almost all day (close to your body)</li>
    <li> Smell only the 30% up to 40% from the original ONE MILLION. I HATE THIS PURCHASE</li>

    <li> I choose this perfum for my husband&lt;br /&gt;yes, I like because your durability and quality&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this product, definitly</li>
    <li> Smells like the tester I tested at Belks.But seem&#x27;s lighter or watered down.Smell not as strong as tester.Packaging seems genuine.Just ingredients seem lightly scented.Kinda skeptical?Anyway tolerable.Do get comments from the ladies.Just gotta spray a little more on when your on the prowl.For the price though.It&#x27;s ok...</li>
    <li> Liked the transaction on this product!&lt;br /&gt;Though product is very diluted. Thus, scent does not last longer than half an hour in me. I have to spray it every other second.</li>
    <li> great product. high quality. i bought this just to give it a try and i love it. if your unsure on buying this scent. dont be</li>
    <li> One of the best men&#x27;s colonge scents I&#x27;ve smelled....smells great on m husband</li>
    <li> This is an awesome cologne. A lady told me that smell \\&quot;like the man you can&#x27;t have\\&quot;. It was charming. Why 4 stars? it&#x27;s becoming too much popular, so every woman in the world could have a mann smelling like this.. hahaha. Great buy for sure.</li>

    <li> arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
    <li> got here on time. everything perfect. i love it :)</li>
    <li> We bought this for our nephew who absolutely loves this fragrance. For him the tones range from Oriental/spicy, Fresh and Citrus/fruity. In his own words he says that not only smells great it has reasonable longevity on application.</li>
    <li> Was the Original.. Bought another one from amazon. (which was FAKE).. Original last 10plus hours...</li>
    <li> 1 million is very soft smells like $1,000,000 , i get compliment everytime I wear just love it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Me costo Demasiado caro .!!</li>
    <li> It has an excellent smell...very soothing and desirable...I will give it 10 stars straight up</li>
    <li> This was on my wish list for a while now... great EDT&lt;br /&gt;Paco Rabanne nailed it!&lt;br /&gt;About the seller... cannot be better!</li>
    <li> Item as described. Great price. Fast delivery. Will use seller again.</li>
    <li> It is a great fragrance although a bit on stronger side. Ordered it for my husband&#x27;s birthday and he is happy with it.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift from my friend from UK. Smells amazing, if you want bitches on you and loving how you smell then this is a great cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells high class and I get compliments every time I wear it. Very strong. Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Gentlemen , Ladies love this  smell. Compliment after compliment. Keep this one in your smell good rotation.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite, as it smells very nice...without being aggressively strong.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it also is encouraging that I&#x27;ve gotten good number of compliments on it as well.&lt;br /&gt;I can see this lasting me a long while, so the price isn&#x27;t bad, either...</li>
    <li> Congratulations i recommend this product for more people, i really satisfied with my Paco Rabanne One Million for men, good job</li>
    <li> Just ordered it since I&#x27;m a fan of Paco Rabanne (classic green bottle) which is more woody and spicy but I was a little disappointed since this is really very sweet and I was expecting something with similar notes.</li>
    <li> My girl loved the scent</li>
    <li> best perfume impossible to get my hands in perfect condition is a completely original product and meets all expectations. Grcias are excellent sellers.</li>
    <li> This is definitely my favorite çologne. People give me longer hugs now that i have it lol. Its nice and clean. Worth every dime</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne.</li>
    <li> Great price smells great</li>
    <li> Received item ontime and love the smell.of tbe cologne.</li>
    <li> Excellent, very good, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell really does smell like a million bucks!</li>
    <li> Shipping was pretty fast. The item came adequately packed.  Aesthetically, the cologne looks great on my dresser. There is just something about spraying some great smelling cologne out of a gold bar. I feel rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, Lets get to what really matter. I absolutely love the smell. I usually do one shot on the chest and one on the back of the neck right out the shower. Above all things, my my wife absolutely loves it!! So....</li>
    <li> Excellent perfume for the night..Its a wonderful fragance, Its great! If I need other gift, I will think in you!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks..</li>
    <li> It has a sweet smell to it. Not a everyday cologne - probably something you&#x27;d pick to put on for an eventful night.</li>
    <li> Nice and spicy! Everyone loves it</li>
    <li> The bottle i have received was defective i could not spray anything. It was as if the bottle was refilled. very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Every man of substance should have this fragrance. There is none like it! I encourage you to buy this product, here you want fail.</li>
    <li> desde Venezuela Muy conforme con el envio fue en el tiempo estipulado la fragancia es ESPECTACULAR deseo volver a comprar pronto</li>
    <li> on time... I get the same and with the same description... very good i like that very much. please keep it up</li>
    <li> e x c e l e n t p r o d u c t v e r y g o o de x c e l e n t p r o d u c t v e r y g o o d</li>
    <li> I bought Paco Rabanne Black Xs L&#x27;exces for a friend. He loves this fragrance and he loved the gift. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Now, this fragrance isn&#x27;t for everyone, (smell wise) but the fact that everyone says this stuff doesn&#x27;t last is bull! I&#x27;ll give it that the scent isn&#x27;t very strong, it&#x27;s mild, but I have a bottle of this stuff &amp; it lasts quite awhile, even w/just 1 squirt. I shake it up real good before each use &amp; rub it in, maybe that&#x27;s why. NOTE: I DIDN&#x27;T BUY THIS FROM HERE. I bought this from a store inside of the mall, (not Macy&#x27;s) &amp; bought the, &amp;#34;Special Travel Editon&amp;#34; that came w/a 3.3FL OZ. bottle of the stuff &amp; 3.3FL OZ. of the shower gel. All together, (if I remember right) was around $72 bucks, so I got a good deal. I gave this 5 stars, (even though I didn&#x27;t buy from here) because I like the fragrance, BUT I think it&#x27;s safer to buy from the store, rather than online. I hope this helped.</li>
    <li> The packaging would suggest a gaudy, overbearing fragrance but that&#x27;s a very wrong assumption. The scent is very smooth and refined.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance!  I came across it while shopping for my boyfriend, tried it on for him and ended up purchasing it for myself!  I know my body chemistry&#x27;s complimentary fragrances and this settles so nicely even as a woman, you&#x27;d never know it was a cologne!  As it fades it settles and softens up amazingly.  It&#x27;s now one of my signature fragrances, I love unique, spicy, stand out smells.  I suggest both men and women should try it and see!  It doesn&#x27;t take much to last all day and night, when you pass someone, they catch a nice little breeze of the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I get excellent article in the stipulated time and my kids do not stop playing because I hope to continue buying</li>
    <li> I have used many different perfumes but this one is the best by far. Smells perfect and gets the attention of everybody.</li>
    <li> This scent is ok, although it does smell girly. The best way to explain this scent is if Aqua De Gio got together with Le Male and had a baby this would be their child. I only wear this out to clubs, bars or parties, because it smells a little girly, but amazingly girls like what they smell when I wear this.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and I now I can&#x27;t keep my hands off him. Soft/gentle scent</li>
    <li> muy buen producto, excelente vendedor, entrega rapida y efectiva, me llego en excelente condiciones, agradecido por tan buen servicio prestado</li>
    <li> very good item and seller</li>
    <li> Smells great! I have women galore just trying to get a whiff. If you want women to smell you and be grossed out; don&#x27;t buy this cologne.</li>
    <li> Hubby loved this scent, very jean-paul esq. This scent reminds me of Jean Paul a bit. Smells delicious... thank you Pacco</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell of this scent but everyone else I have shown this to loves it! If you&#x27;re getting this scent to appeal to the opposite sex, then this cologne will do it for you.</li>
    <li> muy lindo cumpli&amp;oacute; con mis expectativas se lo recomiendo 100% a todos excelente calida llego a tiempo el vendedor muy responsable.</li>
    <li> I would have to say this is my favorite scent right now. A very close second is Ed Hardy Born Wild. I have been on a buying spree with colognes lately. One important thing I have noticed is that if you can find a gift set for the cologne you like, that the Gift set cost the same or slightly more than just the single bottle itself. I am all about getting the best deal, there are a number of things that you can do with the extras. You can gift the extras to friends or relatives. This makes perfect sense to me, especially if you would not normally spend $75 on a coworker&#x27;s gift, but an giving an extra away is like giving a gift for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked the difference between cologne and EDT and found out some interesting stuff. To be honest I thought cologne was stronger than EDT and that is not correct. I know I have bottles of cologne that are 30 years old and are stronger than 1 million edt or at least last a lot longer. (Yes, they have evaporated slightly, but they used to last longer 30 years ago too) An example is Polo lasted all day on me and still does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is part of an Article I found via google:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eau De Cologne (EDC)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is often referred to just as Cologne and has the greatest dilution of fragrances with a 3-5% concentration of perfume essence, lasting up to 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Men Eau De Toilette (EDT)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has the greatest concentration of essence generally available for men and hence lasts the longest, up to 5 hours. It is often available in either a splash or a spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is where body chemistry takes a part in this. My example of Polo lasting on me all day should not happen according to this article, but it does. My thought is that 1 million does not react the same to my heat or body chemistry as the other colognes (EDT) I wear. Just a theory. I heard all of the negatives about this scent is the lack of staying power. To be honest if it did not cost this much I would not have a problem with it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me I feel if you like the scent I don&#x27;t see the longevity of the scent being the show stopper. For me it lasts over 1/2 a day and that is what the above article suggests an EDT should last.roblem with it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me I feel if you like the scent I don&#x27;t see the longevity of the scent being the show stopper. For me it lasts over 1/2 a day and that is what the above article suggests an EDT should last.</li>
    <li> Excelente. Continuar&amp;eacute; comprando a este vendedor. Tienda recomendada para hacer m&amp;aacute;s compras internacionales. GRACIAS POR LA VENTA DEL PRODUCTO. SALUDOS</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and when he puts it on I can smell him a mile away... it is s really rich smell. It smell so good.. I can&#x27;t stay off of him.. ;)</li>
    <li> Great smell, get alot of ho&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Every time my guy wears this scent, we ALWAYS end up together in bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a girl, I find this scent so addictive... I could hug my guy for hours and I don&#x27;t care if he doesn&#x27;t shower before we go to bed if this is what he wears.</li>
    <li> me gust&amp;oacute;. Buen aroma y calidad. Lo recomiendo. Vivo en Republica Dominicana y lleg&amp;oacute; sin problemas. Mas adelante espero tener la misma experiencia con mas perfumes.</li>
    <li> I have a doubt if it is original</li>
    <li> Not only did I have to wait a month and half to get the product. Once I received the cologne it was a fake. I have used Million cologne for the past year and have bought it about 5 times. But not only was the product completely fake compared to my other bottles, the liquid inside smelt like a sweet alcohol. I am pretty bummed about this, but I guess I learned to never buy my favorite cologne from a foreign seller.</li>
    <li> It is the fragrance I wanted. Very good, the smell is delicious. I identify with her, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product. I recommend it 100% I love</li>
    <li> I really like this fragrance smiles gr8.</li>
    <li> i usually don&#x27;t write reviews only when nessesary specially when you don&#x27;t get what you paid for,so to begin I&#x27;m a cologne fanatic i love to smell good currently i have gyvenchy pi,pasha cartier,guess man,lanvin pour homme, CK encounter, CK contradiction, Azzarro Legend,CK escape and now paco1million and i totally love the smell of this fragrance it has a little bit of gyvenchy pi but not as overpowering it tones down nicely and turns into a love potion when it settles down. one thing people forget or maybe they don&#x27;t know is that people have different body quemistry just because a cologne smells terrific at the store doesn&#x27;t mean it will smell great on you or that it will last. so far my colognes perform great on me with good longevity so try before you buy always.</li>
    <li> It is a very beautiful perfumer. i love it. congratulations.</li>
    <li> Product is awesome! Can&#x27;t say enough about it. I bought this cologne for my boyfriend for valentines day and i had no idea what it smelled like. You can not go wrong with this one! I myself have worn it. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Because just the name itself is very inviting, and the scent is mild but yet powerful in the attraction it receives.  I would recommend this to even the president of this country and abroad!!!!</li>
    <li> very good is a strong and very good, inexpensive and comfortable product that can meet the expectations of the buyer</li>
    <li> Compliments and longevity are a plus, you really can&#x27;t go wrong here.  More party and fun scent but can be worn everyday.</li>
    <li> Perfumes are not original, the Fragrances are lost very quickly after applying perfume, I bought the same fragrances in other sites and I last much longer, I feel cheated. Please return my money...Thanks</li>
    <li> It was not as per my expectations but its good</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like original!</li>
    <li> Smell soooo God! Love it</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002XQ1X4G Paco Rabanne 1 Million By Paco Rabanne For Men Edt Spray 3.4 Oz]]LA COMPRA SE CONCRETO CON EXITO LO RECOMIENDO</li>
    <li> gave this as a birthday present to my brother for his birthday thinking how cool a million dollar bar of gold that is actually a cologne makes for a present. so yes this gimmick is strong with this one it will catch your eye and not let it go. basically what happened and i actually dont even remember consciously smelling this one before i bought it. i finally ended up consciously smelling it when my brother opened and when i saw his face i knew something wrong. it smells kind of like perfume and the smell is overbearing in a sickening way. looks cool but smells anything but.</li>
    <li> I say that this is the worst smell I&#x27;ve bought has a unisex type scent that does not distinguish whether a man or woman ... I hate the smell worse</li>
    <li> Because the cologne is amazing.One of the best cologne if bought so far. I would definitely buy this again. Yeah!#</li>
    <li> Paco Rabanne 1 Million By Paco Rabanne For Men Edt Spray 3.4 Oz  excellent fragrance, a good Christmas gift Paco Rabanne 1 Million By Paco Rabanne For Men Edt Spray 3.4 Oz</li>
    <li> I love the scent! This is probably the best fragrance ever. I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t known about it! :)</li>
    <li> The best perfume. Women love to smell it.</li>
    <li> quiero saber que paso con este producto nunca lo recibi</li>
    <li> Delivered on time as they&#x27;ve said, did great, love the perfume , I definitely will buy again from them, thank you.</li>
    <li> Great cologne, smells great.. its one of those you just spray a few drops and it stays on there for like the 2ond day no problem... the quantity is not the greatest but for 45$ here on Amazon its nothing to complain about... i first sniffed it from a magazine and decided to buy it. lol  arrived just as advertised if not better.. this cologne is easily compared to Versaci and such.. it will be one of my top go2 colognes.....</li>
    <li> Excelente los tiempos de entrega, la ropa llego en buen estado. buenos vendedores, Excelente el producto los recomiendo para futuras compras</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. The smell is so nice. It is smooth, fresh and light, and still has a slight hint of dominance. My girlfriend says its her favorite so far. Ive actually gotten a lot of compliments since I&#x27;ve been wearing it. I&#x27;ll be wearing this for a long time. This is probably my new favorite scent. I actually purchased a different bottle first, [[ASIN:B00B21K35S Paco Rabanne 1 Million Cologne Oil: Paco Rabanne 1 Million by Paco Rabanne Type .5 Ounce Roll-on Cologne]] to make sure I liked the scent, before I spent the money on this one. My girlfriend and I thought it smelled so great. I am now a huge Paco Rabanne fan.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my brother and he LOVED IT!!! And I did love it as well!! If you like to be remembered and be marked in the memories of people, this is the cologne!! ;-)</li>
    <li> This is amazing cologne, I recommend it a hundred percent. The girls go crazy when you use it and that is nice.</li>
    <li> Great product, best i have used</li>
    <li> This is a great fragrance for all occasions!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the smell and was delivered promptly..</li>
    <li> I bought to my husband and he loves it</li>
    <li> I chose to be a classic fragrance which I used for several years.&lt;br /&gt;It is the product shipped meets specified by the seller.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product and seller, criterior quality.</li>
    <li> Love this good smilingCologne</li>
    <li> lovely frangrance, better impossible, a great gift for your husband or son</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good seller. Recomended.</li>
    <li> colon.came leaking.and.broken.lost.about.half.the.bottle due to leaking....don&#x27;t.buy...buy.in person...same price</li>
    <li> as someone who used to use issey miyake back in the late nineties...this stuff has a similar affect on the opposite sex...if you know what i mean</li>
    <li> my husband and I liked the smell and the price comparing to other store.&lt;br /&gt;it worths trying... it is a good deal!</li>
    <li> Wonderful smelling sent. Stays on most of day. Fresh, soft, masculine, and feminine all at the same time. Don&#x27;t let the name fool you. You will smell like $1,000,000!!!</li>
    <li> Lovely perfume,the top notes are strong and gradually simmer to masculine base notes,only prob is that it has three hour span on my skin before it dies down,other than that its a great perfume</li>
    <li> 1 - The scent seems to be not original, the smell is not pampering I have previously purchased.&lt;br /&gt;2 - the spray button is not working properly&lt;br /&gt;3 - The color of the base plate is not the same (I have any pictures to show the diferncia)&lt;br /&gt;4 - When the scent comes in contact with skin burns a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to explain all this, because I&#x27;ve bought several perfumes from this and never happened siepre buy it on amazon and is the first time happening to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have several photos of an old (already gone), and you sent me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and I get more expensive to send this to buy another fermufe and you should be very careful with these mistakes that affect susclientes.</li>
    <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the most amazing in the world, I would buy it every time. ! They want me to write amount of words so I do it!</li>
    <li> I GET LOTS OF COMPLEMENTS</li>
    <li> it just smells good, is my parfume and arrived in an excellent condition. This was a good purchase, and i&#x27;m not regreting it.</li>
    <li> It smells like Tutti Frutti AKA Bubblegum flavor.  I couldn&#x27;t say I &amp;#34;hated&amp;#34; it, but I can&#x27;t imagine a man being pleased with it.  Next time you go looking for cologne and you run across this, give it a whiff and tell me it isn&#x27;t Bubblegum.</li>
    <li> I just bought this. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 hours. Very strong stuff, spray lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning, smells like Jean Paul&#x27;s Le Male, but sweeter. Settles down really well. When it drys down, you can smell the Jean Paul profile, but a fresh (like you just got out of the shower), sweet, candy/bubble gum like scent mixes in.  Amazing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like scents like Jean Paul&#x27;s Le Male, YSL&#x27;s L&#x27;Homme Series, Diesel&#x27;s Only The Brave.  Paco Rabanne&#x27;s 1 Million slides right in to that  group.  Great addition to my collection.</li>
    <li> I sprayed this on my arm at the store and thought it was a unique sweet cologne, so I bought it. I sprayed this on myself the same night and within seconds I began to feel sick. I decided to give it another try the next day but with only one spray and got the same sick feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way I can describe this is a spicy bubblegum smell. It reminds me of a potpourri basket. It has absolutely no hint of masculinity. Yes I understand that other people will ask what I&#x27;m wearing. But it&#x27;s only because they are confused why a grown man wants to smell like bubblegum and potpourri.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this cologne if you want awkward attention. I honestly cannot imagine a woman being comfortable around me with this. This is not a real cologne IMHO, it&#x27;s a fad that people will laugh about in few years. If this wasn&#x27;t selling for 80 bucks and didn&#x27;t  come in gold case, it would be an air freshener sitting on top of the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, the people at the store all agreed and I was refunded.</li>
    <li> Great Service and item</li>
    <li> This is an awesome perfume.it Smells like a bubble gum. I would recommend this perfume to everyone. If u really wanna buy it, but it from amazon as it is the only trustable seller out there</li>
    <li> The  order and  delivery date was just  as I  had expected. Super ..the  scent is fantastic will buy from you  again</li>
    <li> Yummy!... Yes Yummy, thats the general response from the girls i&#x27;ve dated. 1 million has been my yummy little secret for last couple years now. I discovered this great scent when i was buying my (at the time) new great cologne (diesel fuel for life). While at JC penny the girl asked if I heard of 1 million, or smelled it? I said no who makes it? She said here... just smell it...Oh, have never smelled anything as smooth/fruity/masculine, as this, just wondrful.  She told me it was made by Paco, And she was a about a super-beautiful 30 something y/o mom.  Well I was kind of really skeptical, because I always thought that original paco rabanne was nasty smelling, overpriced, Yuk-E-ness. But I have too say this 1 million is so smooth, sweet and subtle, and the women love it, heck I love it! Not overpowering at all, and the girls that I let close enough to me... have all said YUMMY!. It&#x27;s my scent now, and it&#x27;s expensive, but and as a 40 something year old man, I&#x27;ll pay for quality. Bottom line...&amp;#34;Women Love It!&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is the worst EDT for men I have used/tried. First what I wear: Armani mania, dolce one or light blue etc, ISSEY MIYAKE eau de issey, GUCCI BY GUCCI COLOGNE FOR MEN, Versace Man Eau Fraiche, YSL La Nuit De L&#x27;Homme.I am in early  thirties male, going out a lot and living urban lifestyle. However, this is not even unisex. It so sweet that is definitely feminine. It is nauseating! Can&#x27;t use it for anything. In short, if you like any of the other great colognes above you will not like this one. I can compare it to diesel zero plus, but that was OK.</li>
    <li> This perfume is the best! For all men, it smell is good, is a quite manly fragrance ...&lt;br /&gt;I bought it as a gift for my dad since he was released.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this fragrance for your husband, boyfriend, brother, friend, for a special being.</li>
    <li> My only issue was that the &amp;#34;GIFT MESSAGE&amp;#34; WAS NOT with the gift</li>
    <li> Best men&#x27;s fragrance out there, bar none! I possess many fragrances, but this one stands above them all. It is a must have!</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne because the ladies&#x27; Lady Million smells so good. After buying One Million, I was satisfied but it does not smell as good as Lady Million. It was a gift so I am more grateful. I&#x27;d highly recommend it</li>
    <li> perfect! i love it and is the perfect perfume for me boyfriend. He love&#x27;s too. Paco Rabanne is the best.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this cologn to anyone. All of my friends dislike it too. It&#x27;s just not for me. I will not recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband and he loved it.</li>
    <li> Becouse it fullfilled my expectation. Very good aroma. Perfect perfum. I will buy it again I will recomend it to my friends</li>
    <li> Exelent product it is just what I expected and more. I like everything about it, it works perfect for me.</li>
    <li> very good perfume, i recomeded it 100%, the smell still for long time, this my first paco rabanne and love it.</li>
    <li> i dont speak english but i only want to say that this perfume it not the original.. the smell is only 5 minuts</li>
    <li> excellent product excellent selling very fast and very reliable treatment very good aroma 100% original and this super good price</li>
    <li> I purchase this product for my boyfriend and he LOVES it. Women are always bragging how good he smells.I give this 5 starts. Not to strong, yet very sexy!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend suggested it to me. Love how it smells. Very classy. Get compliments all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Is the best and i recomend to purchase</li>
    <li> It’s excellent, it last for a long time and best of all, it smells good. I have tried many and this is the best, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It has a great smell..I would recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a nice cologne..I have been buying this product for a couple opf years but amazon had the same size for less money.. I highly recommend anyone to buy this..</li>
    <li> Very pleasant  smell aroma .</li>
    <li> Smells great but prefer the Intense, which as the name suggest is an intense version of the 1 million. I have both the 1 million and the intense, my wife and two teenaged daughters prefer the intense</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant buying fragrances online, since I can&#x27;t smell them like I could in a store, but I have no regrets! I bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute; for Christmas and he absolutely loved it. He wears it all the time, and he is usually very picky about his cologne and sticks to a few good ones. This one made it to his favorites list!</li>
    <li> no original,shoddy product is a copy, the cost is very high for the quality of the product, not recommended thank bye bye</li>
    <li> Fantastic fragrance. I love it</li>
    <li> love the smell, bottle is very stylish, feels like you are holding 1 million</li>

    <li> I give rating 5 stars because it is an excellent product and I found it very good price, arrived on time, the smell is great lasts my boyfriend loved his gift! I recommend it to all the community amazon&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> My husband used to wear this when we first started dating, and then he ran out and never bought it again. I was so thrilled to stumble upon this stuff. It brings back the memories. This is the exact same stuff you would be buying at macy&#x27;s for (30$) more. Smells exactly the same. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!</li>
    <li> It smells very good but I&#x27;m more of a Versace, Sean John, and Hannae Mori type of guy I got this cologne coz a friend of mine said I should buy it since Im into cologne Collecting</li>
    <li> Great product, it has 2014 batch code on it. Great buy</li>
    <li> The Paco Rabanne 1 Million is ultra popular in Europe, and for good reason. The scent lasts long, and projects well. There&#x27;s also an updated version of 1 Million called 1 Million Intense. Not sure how that is supposed to be different from this one, but can&#x27;t go wrong with either one. Purchased directly from Amazon, and was very satisfied overall.</li>
    <li> Lovely cologne. I&#x27;ve been receiving compliments yo!!</li>
    <li> Ladies love this scent. Studies show that the smell of rose increases the sex drive of women. Not that any man would be motivated by that....PURCHASE THIS!</li>
    <li> Great cologne.  packaged perfectly</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
    <li> this iten no longer aviable</li>
    <li> The real thing! I love it!</li>
    <li> Just as described, arrived on time, great product Great smell!!!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! My boyfriend loves it. He gets compliments from other women telling him how good he smells and that they want to buy this for their husbands. Trust me, its worth every penny :)</li>
    <li> excelente el producto lo recomiendo, llego en buenas condiciones. el empaque es muy bueno, no estaba abierto y a tiempo!!</li>
    <li> A real hit, can&#x27;t go wrong with this fragrance.</li>
    <li> La nueva versi&amp;oacute;n de un producto capaz de bajar pantaletas, me gusta mucho esta fragancia, viene en perfecto estado y protegido.</li>
    <li> This is the type of cologne you wear to say &amp;#34;HEY! I AM HERE!&amp;#34; in a good way. You will get compliments on its smell. Unfortunately, the secret is out. Good for clubs not for work.</li>
    <li> The perfume poured everything in the box.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived here in Brazil empty.&lt;br /&gt;Very fragile glass, did not come nothing inside.&lt;br /&gt;too bad.</li>
    <li> mala entrega del producto irresponsabilidad total compre el articulo el 4 de marzo y llego el 11 de marzo ya me habia regresado a venezuela ahora voy a ver como hago para reembosar o enviar a otra direccion. muy mal servicio</li>
    <li> Perfume de extraordinario dise&amp;ntilde;o y de alta calidad. Original, cumplio con lo requerido. Recomendados, fueron muy responsables con el envio</li>
    <li> When I tried this at Sephora I was so impressed, smelled like JPG Le Male but a little different....then the dry down began. Throughout the day the amazing top note faded and the sickeningly sweet mid/bass-notes began. It gave me the WORST headache! I literally started feeling nauseated. When I got home I immediately got in the shower and started scrubbing....no luck. The smell was still there! After soaking in an apple cider vinegar bath, then scrubbing more with baking soda, I finally managed to get this off me. When I got out of the shower, I promptly covered myself with Le Male to erase all memory of this awful scent. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my body chemistry, but this cologne is the worst experience I have had with a scent ever. Looks like I will be sticking to Le Male. If any has any tips on colognes similar to Le Male, I would love to hear them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received many compliments while wearing this alluring fragrance. It adds the stamp superbness to any ensemble or apparel whether day, night, formal, casual, or sport. Trust me.  It&#x27;s definitely a panty dropper. I highly recommend. #headturner</li>
    <li> Yes my husband loved the cologne ,and came on time</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for a present and they sent me a Stee Lauder Pure White Linen instead for LADIES, the worst part of it all is that Amazon.com didn&#x27;t provide an option to file a claim regarding this matter. Now im stuck with this fragrance isntead of the one that i paid for. If you see this Amazon please dooooo something.</li>
    <li> Best Cologne I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
    <li> The product have an excellent quality and it&#x27;s that I was waiting. The articles came to destination just time. Excellent!!!</li>
    <li> thanks for the product all this fine see you later</li>
    <li> excelente producto de buena calidad, llego en el tiempo indicado gracias . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> This is a great scent..this is one of my favorite fragances. Very strong, but delicate at the same time,&lt;br /&gt;shipped super fast..</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite scent, My two favorite scents that I have been wearing for years are Issey Miyake &amp; Jean Paul Gaultier but althought I will continue to buy and wear those two to switch up from time-to-time but this \\&quot;1 Million\\&quot; blows them out the park!!!!! Buy it NOW!!!!</li>
    <li> Thats what this stuff does for you. This is  go to Man Spray from now on. Makes people want to smell ya!</li>
    <li> I love perfumes and I believe I made an excellent purchase. I recommend to all who want to gift or for personal use</li>
    <li> good smell not over board</li>
    <li> I like much, good quality, and got what I buy, would recommend. Everything was fast and easy. I hope to buy in the future.</li>
    <li> There was this Egyptian guy who stopped by the office and every time he did, the ladies would rave about his scent. So, being the friendly person i am, i got to know him and asked him what scent was he wearing. He said it was something from back home and i asked him the next time he goes to bring me back some. well a few moths later he did, and to your surprise it was NOT PACO RABANNE, he brought some stinky smelling oil that smelled of deep mulch, the smell lasted for weeks, and was unpleasant. So i decided to search on amazon to find something that i could cover it up with, When My brother suggested this i was a little hesitant. but it does smell amazing, like an educated bodybuilder.. BTW this is 100% the smell the Egyptian guy was wearing..</li>
    <li> My favorite scent of all. Sensual, spicy, and sweet. The best scent in the history of men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Paco Rabanne 1 Million for my boyfriends birthday as a gift.......he opened it up and I had a feeling that something was off on it but I couldn&#x27;t figure it out....when he sprayed it on it didn&#x27;t smell the same either.... So I did some investigating and just what I thought... ITs a FAKE an imitation!!  I know what the original should look like and smell like and this seller sells fake/imitation colognes! I am SO disappointed and embarrassed. I thought I was buying the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; for my boyfriend and it turns out that I&#x27;ve been taking for granted :(  its a fake!!</li>
    <li> My husband bought this - while the fragrance lasts for a long time, it is quite possibly the most sickening smelling cologne. Without brung rude, I&#x27;d best describe it as &amp;#34;stinky&amp;#34; and pity anyone who has to be subjected to this smell. It&#x27;s absolutely awful!</li>
    <li> Recieved lotion. The whole unit is made from the best quality. Easy to use and the aroma that penetrats the air has great staying power. Best blasted lotion out there. My girl friends all Love it.</li>
    <li> Smelled nice but will not last long</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this and this was a wonderful price compared to my local Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> se recibio el producto a la fecha establecida y no hubo ningun inconveniente durante la transportancion, estaba bien empaquetada para evitar danos</li>
    <li> I want to keep this as short as possible so you dont get bored. All I can say about this stuff is WOW! The scent is amazing. Very light, sweet, fresh and simply amazing. Has honey and flower like scents. I can also smell the Cinnamon just a tad. A must if you like DG-Blue or Kenneth Cole Reaction. Very different but in the same &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent. A must have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to take some unboxing and product pictures and post them so everyone can see what I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased 3 other expensive colognes from Amazon and will be posted pictures and reviews of them today.</li>
    <li> Although the smell of this stays long with you, I expected more for the price I paid for it. I suggest that you buy a small bottle or try it first at the mall or something before you actually buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again the perfume does its work but it could have been better.</li>
    <li> Smelt this sample in a magazine and really liked it,  thus it was an impulsive buy. Definitely regretting it now. Just not the scent for me and now I&#x27;m stuck with a large bottle that I&#x27;ll only use here and there</li>
    <li> Great product .Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance--loved it from the moment I put it on. Stayed on for hours.</li>
    <li> feels great for better time is amazing smell really nice indeed put enough during a trip!!! I recommend this lotion</li>
    <li> Even the dry down stage smells great and the scent is so distinct it seems to stand out and last longer</li>
    <li> product was damaged and had different color metalic pieces on it. The black glass back was far to transparent and it smelled like a watered down version of the actual cologne. The scent was not even a good representation of the cologne 1 Million. Complete Knock-off.</li>
    <li> I had this scent in a sampler and loved it. After ordering it here and trying it out, I&#x27;m fairly certain I received a fake/designer impostor. The sampler of authentic $1 Million I had lasted all day with just a drop or two. I can coat myself with this bottle I received and the smell is gone before I get to the car. Highly disappointed. I left 2 stars because the real scent is great, but I highly recommend paying the extra few bucks to order it off a reputable online fragrance site.</li>
    <li> The truth with all notes on this perfume had expected a more masculine scent, very soft but okay. I had high expectations for this perfume, but for my taste not fulfilled. Not a bad fragrance but not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I received the item I expected, I&#x27;m comfortable with this product. thank you</li>
    <li> excellent delivery and perfume the best I&#x27;ve tasted is original</li>
    <li> Lookin for more great product from you keep up the excellent work</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this.  May be my favorite scent II have ever had.  It has a spicy blend that that has a perfect balance.  It is not too strong, but is strong enough to be noticed.</li>
    <li> I get Compliments every time I wear this product. I am never using anything else again. My wife adores this fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have been shopping around for the best fragrance for awhile now, and got samples of the 3 my wife and I liked&lt;br /&gt;best. I liked the smell of this one the best, my wife liked it, but she liked another one a little better,&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately that one, the fragrance lasted about 2 hours and this one lasted most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;it was not much of a contest. I did not want to pay mall prices for this, so I have had real good luck with Amazon&lt;br /&gt;shopping and returns if anything was not right.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely the right stuff! Although my wife is not too happy with other females leaning close to me and&lt;br /&gt;sniffing then saying that&#x27;s real nice:)</li>
    <li> Very Good product, good brand, presentation and fragance. Soft, nice and subtle. In this range of fragance is a Very good option.</li>
    <li> This is a great and smooth product!!! I bought 3 bottles for myself!!!!! First time I bought it was on 2009.</li>
    <li> excelente producto llego a la fecha esperada y en buenas condiciones todo el proceso fue muy rapido y sencillo gracias</li>
    <li> One guy at work asked me what fragrance it was because he wanted to buy it himself.&lt;br /&gt;One women at a store made a comment to me &amp;#34;This is how a man should smell&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;When I was getting my oil changed a woman sitting next to me made a comment that I smell very nice.</li>
    <li> para todo aquel que le gusten los perfumes esta es una opci&amp;oacute;n excelente, llego sin problema y muy bien envuelto</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this, it&#x27;s just like the reviews said it was, this is the cologne to have, it smells good.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume, but it has the worst spray nozzle. The spray nozzle button was hard to push and after a few tries, and it completely stopped functioning while it was full. I had to break it. I would not enter this review if it was not my favorite fragrance. Efficiency is compromised for a stupid packaging design.</li>
