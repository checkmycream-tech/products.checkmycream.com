      <li>It is so nice to just let it charge and run it over your leg.</li>
      <li>Not so good at shaving legs or armpits--it acted more like a trimmer.</li>
      <li>Is great for quick underarm or leg shaves when you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so cute and portable and easy to use/hold, I wish it worked!</li>
      <li>I would like when I am shaving my leg, but it works ok.</li>
      <li>I think I will use it for my bikini line mostly, bc</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone :)</li>
      <li>His did a much better job - closer and faster - even though I was tethered to the outlet.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the design and the charge holds for days.  </li>
      <li>For an electric shaver it&#x27;s pretty effective!</li>
      <li>It worked better on my thighs, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unless all of your leg hair is fine.</li>
      <li>It says not to charge more than 12 hours at a time, but doesn&#x27;t get a full charge in that amount of time.</li>
      <li>I do have thicker leg hairs but fine thigh hairs, so be warned if you do as well.</li>
      <li>First off, this is a wonderful little shaver and gives you a really nice, smooth shave.</li>
      <li>It was great for shaving the entire bikini area.</li>
      <li>I bought this shaver because it was cheap.</li>
      <li>In my quest for smooth legs, I&#x27;ve tried every type of razor from Gillette to Shop-Rite, Nair waxing Strips to Veet Removing Creams.     </li>
      <li>you get a smooth shave with it</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this product and if you buy it, keep the original box.</li>
      <li>I have the purchase receipt but not the original packaging.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had my original Clio shaver that I bought at Walgreens four years ago</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for someone who doesn&#x27;t need to shave daily</li>
      <li>I had to charge it for a whole day just to use it once and have not been able to get it to charge up again since.</li>
      <li>Good buy, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Good design makes it easier to grip (vs long handles) when shaving legs.</li>
      <li>two that I&#x27;ve bought online, however, have not been worth the price at all.</li>
      <li>Worth what I paid for it.</li>
      <li>I got this shaver because it was a decent price and looked easy to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard good things about other brands, so maybe I&#x27;ll try those.</li>
      <li>You become prickly right away.             </li>
      <li>I will but this again in store because it seems like the one bought online are are NOT working right</li>
      <li>so I could use it on both legs right away when I got it home.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, I was able to use the new charger on my old unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Charged easily and quickly and held a charge through several uses.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it it had been charging for over 10 hours.</li>
      <li>or if you&#x27;re willing to shave often.     </li>
      <li>First time I used it</li>
      <li>Followed directions and charged it first like it said.</li>
      <li>In fact, I lost my first charger on vacation, and just bought a replacement at Wallgreens.  </li>
      <li>Pretty close shave for an electric razor.  </li>
      <li>As long as I make sure it&#x27;s positioned so that the charging light stays on, though, it charges just fine and holds the charge for a long time.  </li>
      <li>I got one of the first at T.J. Maxx, and I have let this razor run all the way down and not only did it bounce back, it holds an excellent charge.</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin, but I never seem to nick myself when I use this razor.</li>
      <li>The hair doesn&#x27;t have to be short, but it helps if it is, then just fine comb</li>
      <li>&gt;easy to use; isn&#x27;t a whole process of wetting legs, applying gel...  </li>
      <li>I really like the design and how it was rechargeable</li>
      <li>I charged it up after every use (which wasn&#x27;t very often, mind you) and it&#x27;s lasted me for five years.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>The one I bought at Walgreens was such a great little thing - it charged really fast and after reaching full power, was enough to do both legs and my armpits without a problem.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t charge well enough for full use.</li>
      <li>The battery one is surely cheaper but not worth the hassle when you need</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m mildly satisfied with this little guy.</li>
      <li>It says that it will trim hairs no matter the length, and this is true - a lot of electric razors will not get the long ones.  </li>
      <li>However, the new unit that I purchased did not work whatsoever.</li>
      <li>So I bought a new unit and figured that I could have both of them around, in case one of them broke.</li>
      <li>: shave is good but not as deep as a wet razor (since you&#x27;re not using cream when shaving dry, injury is reduced</li>
      <li>I love this little shaver!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that the one problem with this product is that the charger doesn&#x27;t always fit tightly into its charging stand.  </li>
      <li>The directions say not to leave it on the charger for more than 24 hours, which I haven&#x27;t, but if you take it off the charger it loses it&#x27;s charge by the time you go to use it.  </li>
      <li>Wow... even my toaster turns off easier than this.</li>
      <li>I ordered another one online a few years ago (not from Amazon, but from another online retailer) when I thought I had lost my original shaver, but neither it nor its charger worked.</li>
      <li>This shaver took well over 24 hours for its first charge, and then didn&#x27;t hold the charge long enough to shave my legs.</li>
      <li>(maybe they reissue the returned ones, as I hear they do)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes: small and travel friendly.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s a fun little shaver that, if you find in a department store or pharmacy and buy in-person, will last you for years and years without much trouble, and will give you a clean shave without nicking.</li>
      <li>but it is not great for more than peach fuz</li>
      <li>, a few months ago, my puppy chewed through the cord of the charger, and I couldn&#x27;t replace the charger without buying a whole new unit.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave either, which isn&#x27;t a big deal to me, though I&#x27;ve only managed to use it once and it barely lasted long enough to shave one leg before the battery died!    </li>
      <li>a waste of money -so much for buying at the lower price range!</li>

<li> This is not a good product, real and fast shipping only, the  product match with all description but not works as expected .</li>
<li> I know there are a lot of people saying this is not a good razor, but I love this little razor.  </li>
<li> Also, the charge doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
<li> I have been trying it out for several weeks, and either it does not work at all, or the charge doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me to do anything - from the time I take it off the charger (fully charged) to reaching for my leg, it is already dead.</li>
<li> This is a complete waste of money - DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
<li> and it only just broke the other day.</li>
<li> I later found my other shaver, though.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
<li> I&#x27;m surprised at the negative reviews I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
<li> but  you have to go over the same spots a few times</li>
<li> I would suggest any other shaver.  </li>
<li> &gt;no use of other products (soap/shaving gel)                                </li>
<li> TIP: run over section multiple times with small strokes instead of one glide up.</li>
<li> Even when the indicator light says it is fully charged, the motor is very weak and is not effective on all parts of the body.</li>
<li> I try not to use it a lot because I don&#x27;t want it to wear down and because I you can&#x27;t replace the heads.</li>
<li> I had previously picked up the Clio (AAA-battery) shaver at Winners/Homesense</li>
<li> It costs about half the price of the remington one, but it works twice as well.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s pretty and it fits well into my hand - unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t do what a shaver should - it can&#x27;t remove any hair - anywhere!</li>
<li> No more problems with ingrown hairs as I&#x27;ve had with some other shaving products.  </li>
<li> The charge gave out while I was using it a few days ago</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> I bought this a few weeks ago.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I gave this razor to my daughter for Christmas and it no longer works. I would not recommend this product and if you buy it, keep the original box. I have the purchase receipt but not the original packaging.</li>
    <li> mine came in i put it on the charger tried to turn it on next day and power button flashes but it wont come on.&lt;br /&gt;j nor</li>
    <li> I got this product because it&#x27;s rechargeable and affordable, but I guess you get what you pay for. The charge gave out while I was using it a few days ago so I used my husbands electric razor to finish that leg. His did a much better job - closer and faster - even though I was tethered to the outlet.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get as closes I would like when I am shaving my leg, but it works ok. I think I will use it for my bikini line mostly, bc it doesn&#x27;t shave close enough anywhere else. Probably won&#x27;t buy it again if and when it dies.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few weeks ago. I really like the design and how it was rechargeable so I wouldn&#x27;t need to worry about buying batteries for it all the time.  Unfortunately, however, the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge. The directions say not to leave it on the charger for more than 24 hours, which I haven&#x27;t, but if you take it off the charger it loses it&#x27;s charge by the time you go to use it.  It doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave either, which isn&#x27;t a big deal to me, though I&#x27;ve only managed to use it once and it barely lasted long enough to shave one leg before the battery died!    I&#x27;m really disappointed with this product and will never buy another Clio item. I&#x27;ve heard good things about other brands, so maybe I&#x27;ll try those.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because it was cheap. Followed directions and charged it first like it said. First time I used it I was so disappointed. Hurt my legs, like it was yanking out my hairs as opposed to cutting them. I do have thicker leg hairs but fine thigh hairs, so be warned if you do as well. It was very painful! It also left a ton of stray hairs. It worked better on my thighs, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unless all of your leg hair is fine. Also, the charge doesn&#x27;t last long at all. It&#x27;s so cute and portable and easy to use/hold, I wish it worked! But it is awful.</li>
    <li> I have to say I am a little disappointed in this shaver. I read the reviews which were all good. It took 2 days to get it fully charged. The first time I used it it had been charging for over 10 hours. I got in the shower, shaved my underarms, proceeded to shave my legs and it was dead! Charged it another day and it was good to go. After I re-charged it, I took it off of the base and when I went to use it again, it died! Guess I will just leave it on the charger eternally. It does a good job shaving, if you can keep it charged.</li>
    <li> In my quest for smooth legs, I&#x27;ve tried every type of razor from Gillette to Shop-Rite, Nair waxing Strips to Veet Removing Creams.     And I&#x27;m mildly satisfied with this little guy. It is so nice to just let it charge and run it over your leg. But the sacrifice is smoothness and longevity. You become prickly right away.             PROS:                                                                           &gt;no use of other products (soap/shaving gel)                                &gt;no cuts+nicks                                                             &gt;easy to use; isn&#x27;t a whole process of wetting legs, applying gel...  &gt;rechargeable (no AAA batteries or 83627 blade replacements!)  &gt;perfect for travel  &gt;comfortable in hand           Cons:  &gt;not a close shave. must be used in every instance in which you need shaved legs (can&#x27;t shave with it one day, wear a skirt the next)   &gt;useless for underarms!     BOTTOM LINE:For an electric shaver it&#x27;s pretty effective! It&#x27;s good for someone who doesn&#x27;t need to shave daily/needs something compact. Buy this product for touch ups or if you&#x27;re willing to shave often.     TIP: run over section multiple times with small strokes instead of one glide up.</li>
    <li> I love this little shaver!  I was using a remington one that lasted me about 6 months, but always felt like it was yanking hairs.  The remington finally died and I picked this one up.  It costs about half the price of the remington one, but it works twice as well.  It was charged enough so I could use it on both legs right away when I got it home.  It says that it will trim hairs no matter the length, and this is true - a lot of electric razors will not get the long ones.  Pretty close shave for an electric razor.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I had previously picked up the Clio (AAA-battery) shaver at Winners/Homesense and I really liked the product so I went to the Company&#x27;s website and eventually ended up on Amazon.com and saw the rechargeable version.  I absolutely love the design and the charge holds for days.  I&#x27;ve had it for a while and it still does a great job!  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone :)</li>
    <li> I know there are a lot of people saying this is not a good razor, but I love this little razor.  I got one of the first at T.J. Maxx, and I have let this razor run all the way down and not only did it bounce back, it holds an excellent charge. I have several razors and this one gives me the cleanest, closest shave.  I try not to use it a lot because I don&#x27;t want it to wear down and because I you can&#x27;t replace the heads.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually review products, but this made me want to write. This is a complete waste of money - DO NOT BUY THIS. I have been trying it out for several weeks, and either it does not work at all, or the charge doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me to do anything - from the time I take it off the charger (fully charged) to reaching for my leg, it is already dead. I would give it a 0 if it were possible. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about a year and I love it.  In fact, I lost my first charger on vacation, and just bought a replacement at Wallgreens.  Easy to use, nice design, and it works great on curves at the knee, underarm, bikini line, etc.  No more problems with ingrown hairs as I&#x27;ve had with some other shaving products.  I&#x27;m surprised at the negative reviews I&#x27;ve seen.  My guess is that the problems with charging may be that the shaver isn&#x27;t fully connecting to the charger.  I&#x27;ve noticed that the one problem with this product is that the charger doesn&#x27;t always fit tightly into its charging stand.  As long as I make sure it&#x27;s positioned so that the charging light stays on, though, it charges just fine and holds the charge for a long time.  Good buy, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I used the shaver during the last months of my pregnancy. It was great for shaving the entire bikini area. Not so good at shaving legs or armpits--it acted more like a trimmer. Charged easily and quickly and held a charge through several uses. Worth what I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver because it was a decent price and looked easy to use. I had to charge it for a whole day just to use it once and have not been able to get it to charge up again since. Even when the indicator light says it is fully charged, the motor is very weak and is not effective on all parts of the body. I would save my money and go for a higher-end product.</li>
    <li> I bought this- it&#x27;s pretty and it fits well into my hand - unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t do what a shaver should - it can&#x27;t remove any hair - anywhere! a waste of money -so much for buying at the lower price range! I would suggest any other shaver.  nancij</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t as portable as their Palm Perfect ones, but this one still works great. I notice that two or so of the women here said that it doesn&#x27;t work on their legs. It works for mine, so, yeah. The hair doesn&#x27;t have to be short, but it helps if it is, then just fine comb it (if you want) with a regular razor. I have had it for about 6 months and it still works great. I bought it through Walgreens, but I don&#x27;t like how you have to buy their replacement blades through their site instead of going to the store and getting them.</li>
    <li> i just go this razor today i has been great you get a smooth shave with it but it is not great for more than peach fuz i would have given it a 5 but  you have to go over the same spots a few times</li>
    <li> Purchased at a Harmon beauty supply store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used the battery operated version for a year and got tired of buying batteries.  So I bought the echargeable one in store and had it for 5 years before the motor died. I will but this again in store because it seems like the one bought online are are NOT working right (maybe they reissue the returned ones, as I hear they do)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes: small and travel friendly. Good design makes it easier to grip (vs long handles) when shaving legs. Waterproof. No batteries. Is great for quick underarm or leg shaves when you&#x27;re in a rush. Charge lasted a few weeks for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: shave is good but not as deep as a wet razor (since you&#x27;re not using cream when shaving dry, injury is reduced cb it gives a surface-level shave), so you may have to touch up underarms after a day or 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it in a store if you can find the rechargeable one. The battery one is surely cheaper but not worth the hassle when you need batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Wife</li>
    <li> It don&#x27;t work is not turning on VARY DISAPPOINTING )-:</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE TOUGHEST THING TO TURN OFF EVER! Wow... even my toaster turns off easier than this. The money I paid for this thing for JUST 2 WEEKS of usage is ridiculous! I can&#x27;t even turn it OFF when I am finished. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, it is horrible</li>
    <li> i charged this, it didnt work - didnt turn on - light kept blinking like crazy even after the 10 hour charge to start it up - lame, have to return an electric shaver b/c its simplest function TURNING ON doesnt work</li>
    <li> This is not a good product, real and fast shipping only, the  product match with all description but not works as expected . This is not a good quality  piece  ....</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This shaver took well over 24 hours for its first charge, and then didn&#x27;t hold the charge long enough to shave my legs. It says not to charge more than 12 hours at a time, but doesn&#x27;t get a full charge in that amount of time.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t charge well enough for full use.</li>
    <li> First off, this is a wonderful little shaver and gives you a really nice, smooth shave. I have super sensitive skin, but I never seem to nick myself when I use this razor. I&#x27;ve bought three of these, though, and would recommend NOT purchasing one online. Try and find it in a retail store, if you can - I bought one at Walgreens and two online. The one I bought at Walgreens was such a great little thing - it charged really fast and after reaching full power, was enough to do both legs and my armpits without a problem. I charged it up after every use (which wasn&#x27;t very often, mind you) and it&#x27;s lasted me for five years.&lt;br /&gt;The two that I&#x27;ve bought online, however, have not been worth the price at all. I ordered another one online a few years ago (not from Amazon, but from another online retailer) when I thought I had lost my original shaver, but neither it nor its charger worked. I later found my other shaver, though.&lt;br /&gt;Then, a few months ago, my puppy chewed through the cord of the charger, and I couldn&#x27;t replace the charger without buying a whole new unit. So I bought a new unit and figured that I could have both of them around, in case one of them broke. However, the new unit that I purchased did not work whatsoever. It would not charge up at all (I even left it on the charger overnight - it didn&#x27;t do anything when I tried using it in the morning). Luckily, I was able to use the new charger on my old unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary...&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this online, don&#x27;t expect the unit to work. However, it&#x27;s a fun little shaver that, if you find in a department store or pharmacy and buy in-person, will last you for years and years without much trouble, and will give you a clean shave without nicking. I&#x27;ve had my original Clio shaver that I bought at Walgreens four years ago and it only just broke the other day. I will either try finding this model in a store somewhere or else buying a different one online.</li>
