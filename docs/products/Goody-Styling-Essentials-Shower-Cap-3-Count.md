      <li>Better than ones I have purchased at stores</li>
      <li>Pretty sturdy and a good size.</li>
      <li>They fit me well, also.</li>
      <li>Also, the bright colors are really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s great feature where you can ask a question and get answers from previous reviewers, I had all the information I needed before ordering.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s just too much cap.  </li>
      <li>Like having the multipack, so you have your replacements ready</li>

      <li>Much bigger and sturdier than the clear plastic ones that lose their elasticity after one use.  </li>
      <li>Pity, I really NEEDED them.</li>
      <li>Not tight enough to keep water off my hair in a shower.</li>
      <li>Also the elastic is not tight enough so it droops alsmost immediately.  </li>
      <li>or if you want to rotate them so no single one gets to damp.</li>
      <li>Third, the elastic on these is nice and snug around my head but not so snug as to be uncomfortable.</li>

<li> like this particular style for a few reasons.</li>
<li> Big enough to cover all your hair and keep everything dry.</li>
<li> For someone with long hair this would probably be a winner.  </li>
<li> Comes in three colors: purple, pink and blue.</li>
<li> No shower cap will last forever, despite leaving them out to dry, and I would rather have no lining and as little fabric as possible to deter mold.</li>
<li> so your hair stays dry.  </li>
<li> Second, these are big enough to hold all of my hair, which isn&#x27;t thick, but is waist length.</li>
<li> Super itchy and uncomfortable.</li>
<li> They will serve my purpose, and I can throw them out when I want to without feeling like I spent a lot on them.  </li>
<li> As expected.  </li>
<li> First, these are basic and unlined, so they are super-easy to throw in the washing machine (on cold, delicate) and let them air dry (as opposed to the lined ones that won&#x27;t dry properly between the lining and plastic).</li>
<li> has some other binding process that&#x27;s not elastic.</li>
<li> These are so reasonable, it is not too expensive to replace them periodically, either.  </li>
<li> These Goody Styling Essentials Shower Caps are the ones I typically use, but have had so much trouble finding them locally lately to replace my last one, which was getting worn out in the elastic area.</li>
<li> They are big enough without being one of those pouffy bouffant types that drive me crazy.  </li>
<li> The shower caps are plain shower caps</li>
<li> These are hard to find for some reason.  </li>
<li> The fabric is thick</li>

    <li> These are excellent - they&#x27;re the perfect size to cover my hair completely, plus they&#x27;re very comfortable. Also, the bright colors are really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s great feature where you can ask a question and get answers from previous reviewers, I had all the information I needed before ordering. A big thank you to samissmiley, Sammy, and Cortney Dickey for all your help!</li>
    <li> I have used these simple but sturdy shower caps for years.  They are big enough without being one of those pouffy bouffant types that drive me crazy.  After all, I just need them to take a shower, nothing fancy needed, and these do the job.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Nothing fancy. Protects my hair while I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
    <li> These are your basic, old-fashioned, no-hype shower caps. They are basically rounds of vinyl with a thin strip of elastic sewn into the edge to secure it over your hair and around your face and neck. Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> These are hard to find for some reason.  Was glad to be able to purchase several in one pack.</li>
    <li> Okay...so they are shower caps!  Nothing extravagant, but just what I was looking for.  They will serve my purpose, and I can throw them out when I want to without feeling like I spent a lot on them.  Six (6) caps for approx. $10 was very good.  They fit me well, also.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> these caps are nice and big.  The fabric is thick so your hair stays dry.  Better than ones I have purchased at stores</li>
    <li> The shower caps are plain shower caps</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. 3 in each pack. Comes in three colors: purple, pink and blue. Pretty sturdy and a good size.</li>

    <li> Good shower cap, and you can recycle it several times until its completely used. I bought for my mom and she like it!!</li>
    <li> These shower caps are made of high quality plastic, but they suffer from the same problem all shower caps suffer from: eventually the elastic gives out. It will take 6 months to a year, but I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a shower cap that either 1) has elastic that won&#x27;t wear out or 2) has some other binding process that&#x27;s not elastic. But while the elastic is working, it&#x27;s a great cap!</li>
    <li> Perfect shower cap!!!  Been looking for something like this for awhile - fits like a disposable shower cap with no unnecessary rim between the elastic and the end of the shower cap and is durable for re-use.</li>
    <li> I see no reason to buy more expensive shower caps in the future!  I bough these after discovering my last &amp;#34;mildew resistant&amp;#34; shower cap with mold along the elastic.  No shower cap will last forever, despite leaving them out to dry, and I would rather have no lining and as little fabric as possible to deter mold. These are so reasonable, it is not too expensive to replace them periodically, either.  They seem to hold up well, however, and I doubt I&#x27;ll need to buy them too often.  Like having the multipack, so you have your replacements ready or if you want to rotate them so no single one gets to damp.</li>
    <li> As expected.  Good quality</li>
    <li> I have short hair.  For anyone who does, this thing is unwearable.  It&#x27;s just too much cap.  Also the elastic is not tight enough so it droops alsmost immediately.  For someone with long hair this would probably be a winner.  I am just not that someone.  Pity, I really NEEDED them.</li>
    <li> These caps are great.  Much bigger and sturdier than the clear plastic ones that lose their elasticity after one use.  Love them!</li>
    <li> Super itchy and uncomfortable. I couldn&#x27;t wait to take it off.</li>
    <li> Well Made shower Cap for thoses times you don&#x27;t want to get wet, full covers your hair and keeps it dry.</li>
    <li> Big enough to cover all your hair and keep everything dry. These are not as nice as those expensive shower caps, but are definitely worth the price. They will last for a while before you need to throw them away.</li>
    <li> Not tight enough to keep water off my hair in a shower.</li>
    <li> These shower caps are simply AWESOME! They are sturdy, come in cute colors, and get the job done.  I am so happy with this purchase.  I would highly recommend to anyone I know.</li>
    <li> Very pleased fits find and keeps water off my hair</li>
