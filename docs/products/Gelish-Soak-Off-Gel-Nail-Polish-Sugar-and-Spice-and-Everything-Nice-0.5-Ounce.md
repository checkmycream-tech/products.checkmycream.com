<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is not real gelish it&#x27;s a knockoff. That being said it still works just as well.</li>
    <li> the color in the bottle is not like the photo.  Its more of a pinkish rose .  Not ugly but not what I was looking for, I expected it to be more of a bright pink.</li>
    <li> BEWARE of color; NOT PINK! THIS COLOR IS MAUVE. I love my pink nail polishes and i was looking for another to add to my collection since its one of the colors i use the most throughout the year although i do have a big collection of colors from different gel brands especially Gelish. Did a lot of research for days looking for another bright hot pink and though this was perfect. I received it today was it was by far the biggest disappointment i have ever had since ordering gel polishes online. It was nothing like any swatches i have seen online. IT IS MAUVE! so do be aware before ordering.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color, real hot pink!</li>
    <li> This nail polish is more of a purple than a hot pink in my opinion.  Its still pretty but not quite what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love it!! I discovered this color at a local nail salon, while the one I received is a slightly darker color than the one at the salon it is still a good color!!</li>
    <li> Color is more of a purple shade (not magenta at all) rather than the pink shade the picture is reflecting. Contacted the seller beautyshine about the mixup and this is their response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Gina,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual color of the product crosses between a purple and a pink, so it&#x27;s close to a magenta color. Pictures listed on the websites are not always accurate as each computer make pick up a lighter or darker shade. We always suggest our customers to Google image the product they are searching for before making a purchase to make sure it meets their expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;Vivian</li>
    <li> pretty color. almost similar to sinful colors cream pink (found at drug store but not gel). if you&#x27;re looking for a pink of this kind, then this is the right one for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect bright purple color it looks like what the rio purple looks like  online these colors though are never what they appear to be online but I&#x27;m obbssessed with this color</li>
    <li> The color was not as shown in the picture. I was looking for a bright pink and i received a purple color which i did not want.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and covers in two coats (unlike a lot of pinks). One of my favorites. Definitely highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice coverage only takes two thin coats to achieve bright pink color, look similar to OPI La Paz or Strawberry Fields.</li>
    <li> It works great but it is a lighter pink then what&#x27;s pictured but it stayed on for at least two weeks and didn&#x27;t chip</li>
    <li> I love this color and Gelish is the best brand out there. The color is a little more purple-y than it looks like on the screen but it&#x27;s still soo cute! I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> The color they show it&#x27;s supposed to be is not what it actually is. I was expecting a nice pink and it&#x27;s a dark red. Won&#x27;t even let me return it ! If I&#x27;m paying $15 for a color, I expect what I ordered but the polish they send is far from the color they show.</li>
    <li> The color is very pretty. Almost exactly like the picture shows it to be. I would recommend this color. It was perfect for breast cancer awareness mo.</li>
    <li> LOVE this color pink. I was looking for a bright pink and this is it. Great for summer time or just wanting to wear a bright color.</li>
    <li> High quality item, like it a lot</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as bright as I thought it would be. I was hoping it would be like the picture. It&#x27;s more like a pepto color</li>
    <li> Great color. It goes on easily. If you make a mistake easy to clean and reapply. I used a lot on my daughters nails.</li>
    <li> Very Disappointing!! Color looks nothing like its pictures. It&#x27;s a dull pink not bright @ all. Gave it 2 stars just because of timely shipping.</li>
    <li> Only problem was I had to put 3 coats to have even color</li>
    <li> The color is not shown how it really looks. It looks like it would be a fuschia but it&#x27;s more of a dark, almost purple.</li>
    <li> Wrong color, the color in the picture is NOT the color you receive.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a purple, not a bright pink. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> A bit brighter pink than I thought but still a pretty color.</li>
    <li> I love Harmony Gelish Polish. It&#x27;s always a smooth consistency and never thick or&lt;br /&gt;Clumpy. I&#x27;ve bought other brands, but this one last longer compared to the others.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Its a pretty/bright pink, goes on nice and smooth. Didn&#x27;t chip or anything. Only need one or two coats. Have had many compliments on the color!</li>
    <li> was not color posted..it was shown as a bubble gum pink came as a pinkish purple. do not buy</li>
    <li> the picture does not match the color received</li>
    <li> Mine was not hot pink like the color posted more of a purple which I really like</li>
    <li> Based on the picture and reviews I thought this would be somewhere along the lines of bubble gum/hot pink.  Its purple.  Not even pinkish purple, just purple.  I was really excited to wear something bright this summer, it’s like a muted Easter purple at that.  Absolutely hate it and pretty upset about the &amp;#34;return/exchange&amp;#34; policy with Beauty Shine.</li>
    <li> I have bought a couple bottles of this color because I love it so much! I always get compliments on it too! My friends have affectionately coined the color \\&quot;Barbie vomit.\\&quot; It goes on great though and looks awesome until I take it off!</li>
    <li> This color is a very pretty pink.  Not hot pink.  I love it and am happy with purchase, but it takes a lot of coats to get the desired color.  I think I literally put on 5 coats, but after that it looked banger! :)</li>
    <li> Love the color it&#x27;s so bright!</li>
    <li> This color is not as it appears in the photo here.  It is a dusty, purplish mauve kind of pink.  It isn&#x27;t close to hot pink or fuchsia at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting Gelish manicures for quite some time and decided to do it myself.  I purchased this color and am very pleased with the results.  Great color!</li>
    <li> Beware! Your not ordering a pink polish!  I accidentally ordered the same nail polish twice about a week apart.  Both orders are the exact same color and it&#x27;s purple. I&#x27;m definitely returning the second one!</li>
    <li> This product is not the same color as shown it is much darker and more purple than pink. I would not buy this again. The gelish is a great gel polish though. I love gelish polish.</li>
    <li> Before you buy this try to sample the color elsewhere since colors can be altered on the computer screen. Plus, if you read the reviews, everyone has a different description of the color. Some say it&#x27;s hot pink while others say it&#x27;s purple. I would say it&#x27;s purplish pink but that&#x27;s just how I see it. It&#x27;s not too bright nor too dark, in my opinion. I think it&#x27;s a very pretty color and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Love this Gelish color. It&#x27;s a purple/pink that totally reminds me of Barbie! 2 coats to get you covered and same great quality Gelish always has.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this color!!!!  Neon pink!  :)</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!! Awesome color!! Perfect for spring and summer. My shipment got to me very quickly and I am very happy with it</li>
    <li> This color is my favorite Gelish color so far! It goes on perfectly smooth, unlike some of the other colors.</li>
    <li> I see this brand used in salons. Do NOT paint it on thick...do 3 super thin coats and cure it twice as long (home lamps are not as strong as salon)...I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Great product and great color - love this brand of polish.  Lasts for weeks and keeps a shine. Would buy again</li>
    <li> Nothing will be better than this. The quality of this product is above my expectations. Great product and it last 3 weeks or more.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a neon pink which it leads to be in the picture but is not.. The color is more of a boring pink that is not vibrant at all.. Not what I was lead to believe it was...</li>
    <li> Perfect barbie doll pink great for the spring and summer. A barbie girl like me will wear this all year long.</li>
    <li> This was my first gelish polish I&#x27;ve attempted myself.  It really is very easy to apply yourself.  No more acrylic nails for me.</li>
    <li> This color is one of my favorite summer pinks. I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a neon pink, as I have couple of neon pinks gel colors from other brands, but I would say it&#x27;s a great summer pink...a true pink. Not a pepto-bismol pink as I have found others to be. Very pleased with this color. A definite must have!</li>
    <li> A nice deep pink colour.  I am very picky with pinks and this one is perfect for me.  I put it on yesterday and used 3 coats.</li>
    <li> Nail polish last for a long time but I could not dry it for 1 hour and that was very inconvenient.  Not every one has the blue light to dry their nail.  I suppose it&#x27;s made for professionals with the correct tools.</li>
    <li> I love this shade of pink!  Color is true to swatch.  Goes on smooth and stays shiny for several days!</li>
    <li> Like the color, its a little uber girly for me, but sometimes you feel like a 80&#x27;s throwback in the middle of a Molly Ringwald movie... blowing bubbles, eating cotton candy, and doing eyeshadow in a rainbow of purple blue and pink.</li>
    <li> If you love pink like I do then you will love this color. Nice and bright. Pink is a good color</li>
    <li> For this product I rated it with a five star because it came on time and was exactly what was advertised on Amazon. The product is a great product with a great price. The product was packaged very well for both security and protection in shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect happy looking pink color.  It goes on smooth just like all gelish polishes.  It looks best with two to three coats.  Stays on for at least two weeks.</li>
    <li> I get a ton of complements on this when I wear it! It is not as hot pink in the pictures, it&#x27;s like a bubblegum/barbie pink and is perfect for summer and spring! Love it!!</li>
    <li> The color is exactly as shown.  Gelish polish is the best thing to ever happen to my nails.  I bought a $25 UV and now do my own nails.  No more nail shops, no more fills and everything I&#x27;ve spent so far has more than paid for itself by not going to a nail shop.  The Gelish is really easy to work with, a lot easier to work with than regular nail polish.  As long as you don&#x27;t get any polish on the bottom of the cutical any excess on the side or top of your finger comes off your skin in the shower. It looks like a professionally done manicure.  If you apply regular clear nail polish once  a week the polish will last 2 weeks even if you do housework or use a computer regular.  I just can&#x27;t get over how great the Gelish product is.</li>
    <li> Color is bright and looks great.  Goes on thick so one coat covers good.  Did my toes too and they look awesome!</li>
    <li> Super cute color - bubble gum pink (not neon).  Perfect for Spring/Summer.  I am super girlie and I love it for any season.  It&#x27;s a great look for short to medium squoval nails; should compliment most skin tones.</li>
    <li> The best pink color! Came really quickly and is a really pretty color and great quality product!  I&#x27;s for sure going to get more gelish colors.</li>
    <li> This gel turned out to be more violet than pink. The color is still very pretty. I jazzed it up by putting a layer of gold glitter over the top which I liked a lot. I would have preferred a pinker hue.</li>
    <li> I love the color. It looks slightly more purple than the picture (not a lot though) but I love it none the less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I still freeking love this color!</li>
    <li> I and my girls (and girl friends) were very happy with this color and product!  The price was worth the product.</li>
    <li> Not happy at all with this color, it&#x27;s not pink as shown, it&#x27;s a light shade of purple...</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not pink, the real color is a purple of some kind, I wish i would&#x27;ve gotten pink. You cannot return toxic products in the mail. so check the colors in a salon before buying</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost a neon pink. Its very bright and eye catching. It actually is an exact match for my daughters Hello Kitty backpack. As with all Gelish paints, I get a beautiful smooth finish that looks like my nails were done professionally, and not in my kitchen.</li>
    <li> I find it helpful to have online colors compared to everyday items, i.e., Post-It-Note Yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular polish reminds me of an azalea plant in full bloom. It&#x27;s a beautiful blue-based fuchsia. (In case u don&#x27;t know, most colors r either yellow-based or blue-based. Our skin tones usually like one or the other but seldom both.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U may want to consider your skill level w gel polish application when choosing the darker shades bc mistakes r more apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion Gelish makes the best gel product available, and processing orders through Amazon has never disappointed me.</li>
    <li> Nice color but shrivels a little under the uv light, not sure why. The second coat fixes that though. I love Gelish- the other colors do not have this problem.</li>
    <li> Pretty shade of pink almost a neon pink but not quite, my clients love it. Great Spring color for 2013</li>
    <li> Works just like salon</li>
