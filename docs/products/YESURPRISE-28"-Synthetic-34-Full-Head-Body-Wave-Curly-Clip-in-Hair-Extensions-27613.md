<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an amazing buy! It gave my so much confidence!!😊</li>
    <li> Too heavy and two of the clip in pieces were broken!</li>
    <li> Wow! I just got this in and it&#x27;s amazing! Super soft and matches perfectly! Kinda really shocked because of how cheap it was.</li>
    <li> I cut one up to use as &amp;#34;boosts&amp;#34; to my hair.  NO ONE knows what I did.  Love these.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like!&lt;br /&gt;Looked so fake&lt;br /&gt;Try putting it on and looked like I was ready for Halloween&lt;br /&gt;Also didn&#x27;t fit right&lt;br /&gt;Your better off seeing it first before buying waste of money 😞</li>
    <li> This hair peice was a good price and the hair is very synthetic looking. The color would be hard to match but I made it work.</li>
    <li> Received them quickly. They were too shiny to look real, but some dry shampoo fixed that perfectly. Great length. They stay in nicely. But they do get tangled very easy. But I just have to carry a little pocket brush around. (I&#x27;ve always wanted to, now I have an excuse)</li>
    <li> Awesome quality.  Fast shipping. Great price.</li>
    <li> Very soft and shiny. It isn&#x27;t quite the right color match for my hair. But it is the same color as posted, I was just off on my color. It was a good price for starter extensions.</li>
    <li> OMG...I Literally JUST got this in, and I LOVE it. I was SO excited. So basically, I mainly got this to see what it would be like if I had long hair. My hair is bra length, but I want it to my waist. I will wear this some times in public, though not to work because It would be silly and I would not want to explain myself as to how my hair is all the sudden longer... I was worried that the color would not match, but it blends in with my hair to a T! It&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s so pretty, and it doesn&#x27;t really look that fake. It was as long as I wanted it to be....Thank you so much! And for only 10 bucks? What a great product!</li>
    <li> These extensions are awesome they&#x27;re easy to manage , no knots, and super cheap RECOMMEND!!!</li>
    <li> The quality of the hair itself is good. there were two combs that were broken so had to replace them instead of sending them back.  This piece is very very heavy and would not recommend for most with thinning hair as it will pull on your existing hair.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, matched perfectly, easy to use. Could not be happier.</li>
    <li> Way too heavy. Especially for the 9 year old I got it for.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. better than expected.</li>
    <li> Love this so much!  I personally have thick hair and with out even cutting or blending them I love them ! Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Look fake, but works for costumes</li>
    <li> Perfect for our daughters prom.  She has long hair but wanted another few inches. Arrived very quickly and added volume and length. The color was a perfect match to her natural color. Great product!</li>
    <li> A little long, but fits nicely and the color is an EXACT match.  I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Matched my hair color perfect.  Great quality.  Piece is very thick and easy to put on.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful when ordering this that it would work with my hair, the picture looked just like the color of my own hair.  Well it didn&#x27;t fit my head properly,  and the hair didn&#x27;t match at all to my own. It has been unusable since then and I&#x27;d sell it to someone else that had matching hair if I could because it was a huge waste of money.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t figure out how to put this sucker on but its great quality, looks like real, natural hair.</li>
    <li> The length is wonderful and the shipping was speedy! However the color is a lot lighter than imagined and I haven&#x27;t found a dye that&#x27;ll darken it to save my life.</li>
    <li> I love it, it feels and looks like healthy shinny real hair. I&#x27;m buying it again so I can wear two extensions at once ,but you really only need one beause it covers so much of my hair! Beautiful!!&lt;br /&gt;(this is the wife posting a comment on husband&#x27;s amazon account, he&#x27;s not he one wearing hair extensions hahah)</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these. They are synthetic hair, so can be very heavy, but she has straightened and styles them just like her usual human hair extensions. She likes them very much.</li>
    <li> This was even better than expected.  I can&#x27;t believe how great it was, especially for the price.  I bought it so my 5 year old could look like Rapunzel at Disney World.  It matched her hair color perfectly and looked like real hair.  We used a head band to cover up where I pinned it to the top of her head.  She looked so cute.  She was twirling and flicking her hair around like she was all that, and it didn&#x27;t seem to get frizzy or knot up.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I am super happy with this product, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the color would match my hair when I ordered it but when it came it the mail I was so surprised! it matched perfectly and I absolutely love these extensions! I would recommend this to anyone! Another pro was that they were so affordable!</li>
    <li> Loved them. Perfect and full of bounce . More than what i expected for a cheap price.</li>
    <li> Great! It&#x27;s a little too shiny and long to look natural but for a cheap extension it looks great! I&#x27;ll definitely wear this for fun or special occasions!</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift she was exited</li>
    <li> Beautiful and matched well and delivery was as expected.</li>
    <li> LOVED THEM! Recently got a short pixie cut and didn&#x27;t care for it much. Ordered the blonde ones, PERFECTLY MATCHED MY HAIR. However, if you have short hair like me, you may have trouble covering the clips, as they are pretty obvious, but add a wide headband or a hat of any kind and looks exactly like real hair!</li>
    <li> Remarkable quality for the price! Easy to use!</li>
    <li> I am VERY happy with these extensions. The color blends in with my hair perfectly. It is just a little bit shinier than my real hair but that&#x27;s nothing a little shine spray couldn&#x27;t fix! It was much longer than I expected! The only downside is that I have shoulder length hair, and my ends don&#x27;t blend with the extensions.</li>
    <li> I wish i can but no stars. I really thought this would match my hair. My hair is the same color as the picture. When i got it it was way lighter!</li>
    <li> amazing quality for synthetic hair.. can style on low setting heat. Very thick and NATURAL looking! bravo!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, delivered in a timely fashion. Quality materials,  and clips with silicone.</li>
    <li> At first was nice but after about 2weeks the ends of it became untamable. I washed with good shampoo and conditioner didn&#x27;t use any heat of any kind. Just did not like at all. I purchased a synthetic brand for my daughter from a diff brand &amp; seller and the hair was much better. Very silky and smooth even after being worn some time did not get tangled either. Will not buy from again. Sorry.</li>
    <li> Just got this in over the weekend- matches my hair awesomely, AND looks fantastic.  I bought it for a costume, but am tempted to wear it in real life because it makes my hair look long and fabulous!</li>
    <li> There are so many negative reviews on this, but I think that&#x27;s if you have irrationally high expectations. If you use a little dry shampoo and sea salt spray, this looks exactly like human hair. It&#x27;s easily cut for layers and blending into your own hair, and there are enough different shades that it doesn&#x27;t look like Barbie hair at all. I have quite short hair, and I&#x27;ve attached a picture of me wearing these cut to length - you can&#x27;t tell at all where my hair stops and these extensions begin!</li>
    <li> I was worried about this one but the color matches my hair exactly. The strands are very natural-looking and the hooks can be placed anywhere from the crown down and look fabulous. Much longer than I thought. The curls are very pretty.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; as the picture looks</li>
    <li> Stupid. Really heavy in your hair, clips don&#x27;t stay in...looks super fake.</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair piece-easy to put on and looks so real! Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> You get a lot of &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; for your money.  I bought 2 clip sets.  Received it within the delivery time. Packaged well with instruction on how to put hair clip in and care of hair. Color was right on &amp; it is long at 28&amp;#34;.  Still working on how to get it in the right area of my head/hair to make it look ok. Not like the picture.  Model must have long natural hair and have clips in lower for fuller look. I may need to go to single clip hair pieces instead this wide piece with 4 clips for more control of where the pieces goes for my shorter hair.</li>
    <li> Best clip in hair I have ever had - Its super thick so my hairdresser cut layers and thinned it out some - Over all I just wish it would curl better with my curling iron - I used sponge rollers over night to reset the wavy - its pretty - thickest and best and I have been buying fake hair for years .. wish it had clips at the bottom - but its so perfect  and stays on easy with no problems..  RE Review - after you was this hair it turns into straw and looks FAKE..</li>
    <li> They looked too fake in my hair. Didn&#x27;t like them at all. Sorry.</li>
    <li> Was late due to a mess up on the post office behalf. Was packaged nicely and they are great for how cheap they where. Would Def recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The hair is super nice! I have straightened and curled it. It was a perfect color! Everyone keeps saying how long my hair has gotten. I just keep my secret to myself. The seller was very quick with response when I had a question. The bonus was it arrived a lot quicker than anticipated. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for the price but hard to put in</li>
    <li> Color didn&#x27;t match but  everything else was fine</li>
    <li> Great look, can cut to your liking and clips on nicely.</li>
    <li> I bought these not knowing what to expect, but when I got them I was pleasantly shocked. These are absolutely beautiful and don&#x27;t look synthetic at all! I also received them months before the expected date, and since it&#x27;s only one piece that covers your head, it&#x27;s super fast and easy to put in! I was even able to blend in the color with my hair color! I love it so much I just also ordered them in the straight style! This is a MUST have!!!</li>
    <li> was good for a week, than came unthreaded.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty one piece hair extension. It is thick, is of good quality and feels soft.  It looks very natural especially if you put some baby powder on it to dull the shine, which most synthetic hair is noted to have.  It can be used for creating several different looks.  The clips are very secure and it feels comfortable on.  The color is perfect for me. I wore it in a style over to one side and received numerous compliments on how nice my hair looked. I already purchased another curly one as well as one in the straight style.  I have not received the straight one yet but am expecting that it will be just as nice. The price for this hairpiece is excellent.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great price.feels heavy on the head</li>
    <li> My hair is so thick I need to order another or these get lost, but that isn&#x27;t the fault of the piece. Full and pretty. Doesn&#x27;t photograph the best, but for the price I&#x27;m not complaining. I&#x27;d give it a higher rating, but it came with a broken clip.</li>
    <li> Uncomfortable to wear all day but looks nice.</li>
    <li> I got these extensions about a week after I ordered them. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect because most people don&#x27;t like synthetic extensions but I am SO happy I got them they are so pretty and long and natural looking and they come with a lot of hair. If you are looking to add a lot of length to your hair for a cheap price this is the way to go!! They are really curly and come with 5 clips on the weft. I recommend these extensions  -kz</li>
    <li> One of the clips broke off after using it twice, but it is still usable....It&#x27;s pretty heavy to wear all day though.</li>
    <li> My 4 star review is based on the quality of this item, not on wearing a hair piece.  I wanted a little extra volume for a photoshoot, but ended up removing it because, though it was shiny and matched my hair well, it looked a little dragqueen-ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I can&#x27;t imagine anyone wearing this on a regular basis.  It&#x27;s kind of heavy, hot, and you couldn&#x27;t dance around in it because it wold pull at the roots.  Moral of the story, be happy with your own hair and confident with who you are.  But if you can&#x27;t do that, this is at least a well made fake.</li>
    <li> Love it, it blends well and doesn&#x27;t even look or feel like extensions definitely worth it</li>
    <li> For the price this product was great.  I got many uses out of it and the placements of the clips were perfect.</li>
    <li> I actually have not put it on. It looks good for the price, I just don&#x27;t think the curl will match my hair the way I had hoped. The color is good though, and I have not returned it or thrown it away. I wish I had purchased the straight one. For the price, I still might. ;)</li>
    <li> These are soooo much prettier than the picture. They are absolutely beautiful. Great curls and very shiny. They are so thick! I&#x27;m used to 200 dollar extension from Sally&#x27;s and these might be better. Especially for the price. I love how it&#x27;s four rows all connected. They are very long and also very wide. Almost too wide to clip on my head. The only downside is they are very heavy. I&#x27;ve been wearing extensions for four years and thought I&#x27;d be fine after reading the reviews but they are very heavy to wear. Highly recommend for the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing product absolutely in love. Posted picture of my current hair which is very short. With a few body pins to pin my hair in the back and a clip to hide my layers it looks amazing! Works amazing as you see on short hair too!</li>
