      <li>and she is thrilled with it.  </li>
      <li>A couple of the implements I had to figure out what they were even for, because I don&#x27;t go that in-depth with my own nails.</li>
      <li>Seems to be nice, and it works well.  </li>
      <li>I liked it&#x27;s \\&quot;manly look\\&quot; for being a manicure set.</li>
      <li>It was well made and my husband will enjoy it when he sees it in his stocking!</li>
      <li>What more can you ask for on a mani/pedicure set?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad they sent something</li>
      <li>Product was just as described - not sure what all the manicure items are used for but made a perfect gift - and was received in a timely manner.  </li>
      <li>Makes you feel rich.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for the right case that was affordabel, but wouldn&#x27;t be cheap</li>
      <li>Many of the other tools aside from the clippers felt really cheap, like the tweezers and both scissors.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The zipper broke the first time I opened the case and was not repairable.  </li>
      <li>The zipper broke the first time I opened it, resulting in me returning it.</li>

      <li>the item is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I tried to order one of the more expensive sets that Amazon carried so that I would get good quality instruments.  </li>
      <li>The case itself is durable enough to be tossed around and looks fine as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Three stars because the set looks nice, but only half of the items are useful, while the rest lack in quality.</li>
      <li>I selected this manicure set as Christmas gifts for my daughters.&lt;br /&gt;Although they won&#x27;t receive them until Christmas, I am pleased with&lt;br /&gt;the quality which is how I like to buy such necessary \\&quot;staples\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
      <li>The tools seemed to be high quality.  </li>
      <li>The clippers (three different ones) are nice and have little side guards</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m planning to throw this set out as soon as I get a new set.</li>
      <li>Works like a charm, classy gold finish.</li>
      <li>well-dressed, professional women.</li>
      <li>Too bad, the tools were beautiful and looked well-made.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t uniformly sharp; in fact, it would be a stretch to even describe some parts of the blade as dull, being more blunt than anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> I bought this as a gift for my brother. I liked it&#x27;s \\&quot;manly look\\&quot; for being a manicure set. The tools came in a very nice zipper case and the case came in a nice box. I just put a bow on it and gave it to him! The tools looked and felt like they were made of good quality. I was very pleased!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, classy gold finish. Makes you feel rich. Nice quality set, very pleased and would recommend any day.</li>
    <li> Great service and the perfect size.  Quality materials</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t send me the case that I had chosen. I ordered the product as a gift for my sister and ended up simply giving her the one they had sent me. I&#x27;m glad they sent something but I wish the site would have told me the one I had chosen was sold out. Aside from that the product seems to be alright.</li>
    <li> I selected this manicure set as Christmas gifts for my daughters.&lt;br /&gt;Although they won&#x27;t receive them until Christmas, I am pleased with&lt;br /&gt;the quality which is how I like to buy such necessary \\&quot;staples\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;for well-dressed, professional women.</li>
    <li> The zipper broke the first time I opened the case and was not repairable.  The tools seemed to be high quality.  Too bad the product fails because of the case.  Returned the item within 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes but the blades on the clippers are not very good. They aren&#x27;t uniformly sharp; in fact, it would be a stretch to even describe some parts of the blade as dull, being more blunt than anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m planning to throw this set out as soon as I get a new set.</li>
    <li> For the price this is very nice! I really liked the leather case! It was well made and my husband will enjoy it when he sees it in his stocking! I have been looking for the right case that was affordabel, but wouldn&#x27;t be cheap and I got the best of both in this case!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the zipper was broken on the case. Too bad, the tools were beautiful and looked well-made. If it hadn&#x27;t been purchased as a gift, I would have kept it!</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my husband. I like the case and look of the set. The clippers (three different ones) are nice and have little side guards so clippings don&#x27;t shoot off into your eye or the carpet. A couple of the implements I had to figure out what they were even for, because I don&#x27;t go that in-depth with my own nails. Many of the other tools aside from the clippers felt really cheap, like the tweezers and both scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars because the set looks nice, but only half of the items are useful, while the rest lack in quality.</li>
    <li> I tried to order one of the more expensive sets that Amazon carried so that I would get good quality instruments.  However, on the manicure scissor, the blades did not even come together, so you could not cut your nails!  Very disappointing.  I am still looking for a set with good quality instruments.</li>
    <li> What more can you ask for on a mani/pedicure set? All the tools work as intended. The case itself is durable enough to be tossed around and looks fine as well.</li>
    <li> Seems to be nice, and it works well.  Why are a set number of works required, is terseness not a virtue?</li>
    <li> the item arrived on time. the item is exactly as described. small case with all what i need!! i love it!!</li>
    <li> I received the product in a timely manner however the wuality of the prodduct is very poor. The zipper broke the first time I opened it, resulting in me returning it.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Xmax gift for my son.  This is exactly what he wanted and is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The quality of the tools and case is excellent.  We gave this as a gift and she is thrilled with it.  I am sure this will last her a lifetime.</li>
    <li> Very nice set....I would recommend it....</li>
    <li> Product was just as described - not sure what all the manicure items are used for but made a perfect gift - and was received in a timely manner.  I would definitly order from this vendor again.</li>
