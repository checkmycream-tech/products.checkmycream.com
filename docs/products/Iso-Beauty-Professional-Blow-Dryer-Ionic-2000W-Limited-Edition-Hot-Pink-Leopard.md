      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>She loved the look, sound and the quality of the power</li>

      <li>but she&#x27;ll love the color.</li>
      <li>Love this blow dryer</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>Easy to hol and use.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>The attachments don&#x27;t lock in so they fall off easily, wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
      <li>Hands Down the best blow dryer ever.</li>
      <li>The blow dryer itself is sturdy with a long cord, the color is great and the two nozzles are even better.</li>
      <li>Most professional hair stylists will tell you that the more wattage the better.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy it is worth noting a Wal-Mart blower work better than this</li>
      <li>It is lightweight and comfortable to hold.  </li>
      <li>say it is light weight.</li>
      <li>Very powerful and well built....</li>
      <li>Love the vibrant color and leopard pattern!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe that to be true, I held it up for a good 1/2 hour trying to test it, and it is actually quite heavy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color is exactly like the picture and the product seems to work fine.</li>
      <li>Received quickly worked well for two months and then sparked where cord connects and died.  </li>
      <li>now the price has more than double and in some cases, more than trippled.</li>
      <li>This one is lightweight, smaller than typical salon grade blowdryers and perfect for business travel.</li>
      <li>A really pretty and powerful hair dryer.</li>
      <li>Its light, easy to hold for long periods of time, and plus its PRETTY!</li>
      <li>As far as rough drying, I don&#x27;t really do a whole lot of that except on my own head, but my results are pretty good as far as I can tell.</li>
      <li>So much for that!</li>
      <li>First, the value of this dryer is about $200-$250, but I brought mines between $40-$50 off of Amazon...</li>
      <li>Most blow dryers are the standard 1875 watts.</li>
      <li>and it dries your hair fast!</li>
      <li>Igetting ready for work</li>
      <li>they are very sneaky when it comes to the wattage.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an okay blow dryer, louder than I expected.  </li>
      <li>It is heavier than most blow dryers I&#x27;ve owned but not heavy enough to make me not like it!</li>
      <li>I use it daily on all my clients in my Hair Salon drys quickly and never any complaints from my clients not too hot either.</li>
      <li>seriously most of the time just 1-2 passes and the hair is straight, shiny, and dry!!!</li>
      <li>I usually purchase cheap blowers and so wish I had stuck w/that!!  </li>
      <li>It made a very loud pop, sparked, and started smoking!</li>
      <li>The buttons are easy to use when switching between settings while drying your hair and the dryer doesn&#x27;t get very loud either like other dryers....</li>
      <li>I am a new cosmetologist, and my husband purchased this for me as a gift.</li>
      <li>it has a cool&lt;br /&gt;shot, an extra long cord and dries the hair quickly!</li>
      <li>Was it refurbished marked as new?  </li>
      <li>I blows too hard , even on light setting!</li>
      <li>I recommend the Twinturbo 3500 Professional Hair Dryer.</li>
      <li>This works GREAT for that thick hair that takes forever to round brush!</li>
      <li>Nice blow dryer, a little heavy and</li>
      <li>My only problem is that upon receiving the item, and plugging it in, found that is was completely defective and wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If your like me and you want a professional blow dryer without the enormous hefty price tag</li>
      <li>I am awaiting to see if this will be replaced..........what a great disappointment will not purchase this again!</li>

<li> I have natural curly hair and it didn&#x27;t take long at all for my hair to dry using this dryer...</li>
<li> On the plus side it matched my flat iron to the &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; which is from a different brand as well.</li>
<li> The heaviness (considering how small it is) is a real  drawback for me.</li>
<li> Mine is only a couple months  old and have only used it a few times and it caught fire and no longer turns on,,,I</li>
<li> My daughter wanted this product to match her flat iron set</li>
<li> This is a piece of craps I bought it barely used it and in less than 3 months it broke.</li>
<li> Hope it lasts for a long time!</li>
<li> Not powerful enough to dry my wild, thick hair.</li>
<li> This was the going rate for all ISO limited editions: pink leopard, peacock...</li>
<li> Dries quickly, no fly always for fine hair...but a markup of over 300% is ridiculously greedy.</li>
<li> Other than that I like it.</li>
<li> This one doesn&#x27;t even cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite disappointed that I wasn&#x27;t even able to test it out.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a hair stylist and I am using this pink cheatah blow dryer in my salon now!</li>
<li> I spent half the time in the morning</li>
<li> But, mine blew up on me the other day!</li>
<li> This dryer dries my hair in half the time of others I have used.  </li>
<li> I paid less than $50 for this dryer a couple of months ago.</li>
<li> My daughter likes it, but I think it&#x27;s VERY heavy compared to other dryers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
<li> then the heat doesn&#x27;t blow heat no more.</li>
<li> the handle is hard to hold without accidentally changing the settings.</li>
<li> Blows out only cold air.</li>
<li> I have really thick hair and the speed and power of this</li>
<li> Kinda uncomfortable to use too..</li>
<li> I am a bit disappointed it does not have a cold shot button</li>
<li> wish I could return it:(</li>
<li> For the money you will not be disappointed!</li>
<li> Disappointing!!</li>

    <li> This is a piece of craps I bought it barely used it and in less than 3 months it broke. When I checked it just have 30 days for warranty. Don&#x27;t buy it is worth noting a Wal-Mart blower work better than this and you still have 90 days warranty</li>
    <li> I paid less than $50 for this dryer a couple of months ago. This was the going rate for all ISO limited editions: pink leopard, peacock...now the price has more than double and in some cases, more than trippled. It&#x27;s is a great blow dryer. Dries quickly, no fly always for fine hair...but a markup of over 300% is ridiculously greedy.</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer and it dries your hair fast! But, mine blew up on me the other day! It made a very loud pop, sparked, and started smoking! I only had it for 6-7 months.</li>
    <li> Hands Down the best blow dryer ever. I spent half the time in the morning Igetting ready for work .it is just awesome</li>
    <li> A really pretty and powerful hair dryer. Easy to hol and use.&lt;br /&gt;A good purchase. Would recommend. And variable speed and heat levels make&lt;br /&gt;it perfect.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this dryer!!!! First, the value of this dryer is about $200-$250, but I brought mines between $40-$50 off of Amazon... The buttons are easy to use when switching between settings while drying your hair and the dryer doesn&#x27;t get very loud either like other dryers.... I have natural curly hair and it didn&#x27;t take long at all for my hair to dry using this dryer... In fact I was done drying it within 10-15 mins (note: I separated my hair into four sections). I would in face recommend this dryer to anyone, no matter your hair type... On the plus side it matched my flat iron to the &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; which is from a different brand as well. I would definitely purchase another one.</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer I use it daily on all my clients in my Hair Salon drys quickly and never any complaints from my clients not too hot either. Love the vibrant color and leopard pattern! NO PROBLEMS as of yet and I&#x27;ve had this dryer for almost a year. Great dryer for the price! I WOULD buy a second one in a heart beat!</li>
    <li> Not the greatest hair dryer, but its pretty!.. I blows too hard , even on light setting! Kinda uncomfortable to use too..</li>
    <li> For the money you will not be disappointed! I&#x27;m a hair stylist and I am using this pink cheatah blow dryer in my salon now! I love it it has a cool&lt;br /&gt;shot, an extra long cord and dries the hair quickly! It is heavier than most blow dryers I&#x27;ve owned but not heavy enough to make me not like it!</li>
    <li> I usually purchase cheap blowers and so wish I had stuck w/that!!  I have not even had this dryer 1yr yet and it is blowing flames!!  I am awaiting to see if this will be replaced..........what a great disappointment will not purchase this again!</li>
    <li> I have tried many blowdryers. This one is lightweight, smaller than typical salon grade blowdryers and perfect for business travel. I have really thick hair and the speed and power of this is great - has sped up the time it takes me from start to finish.</li>
    <li> I am a new cosmetologist, and my husband purchased this for me as a gift. I used it in the salon I started at and even converted one of the veteran stylists to this dryer after she borrowed it one day!  She had been using the same brand for YEARS until she borrowed this from me. This works GREAT for that thick hair that takes forever to round brush! seriously most of the time just 1-2 passes and the hair is straight, shiny, and dry!!! As far as rough drying, I don&#x27;t really do a whole lot of that except on my own head, but my results are pretty good as far as I can tell. Its light, easy to hold for long periods of time, and plus its PRETTY!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay blow dryer, louder than I expected.  The attachments don&#x27;t lock in so they fall off easily, wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> i bought this for my 10 year granddaughter. so she have not received it yet.....but she&#x27;ll love the color. let&#x27;s hope it works well for her</li>
    <li> My daughter likes it, but I think it&#x27;s VERY heavy compared to other dryers I&#x27;ve had. The color is exactly like the picture and the product seems to work fine. The heaviness (considering how small it is) is a real  drawback for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter as a gift. She loved the look, sound and the quality of the power</li>
    <li> Luv it!!!!  Best hair dryer I ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dries hair in 10 minutes!!!!! Very powerful and well built....Hope it lasts for a long time!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this off of groupon. The blow dryer itself is sturdy with a long cord, the color is great and the two nozzles are even better. My only problem is that upon receiving the item, and plugging it in, found that is was completely defective and wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also they are very sneaky when it comes to the wattage. The label on the box says 2000w, but when you look at the stamp on the actual blow dryer it is 1600w. Not powerful enough to dry my wild, thick hair. Most professional hair stylists will tell you that the more wattage the better. Maximum wattage you want on a blowdryer is about 2000. Most blow dryers are the standard 1875 watts. This one doesn&#x27;t even cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite disappointed that I wasn&#x27;t even able to test it out. Now I have to go through the hassle of sending it back and waiting for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the reviews on here say it is light weight. I don&#x27;t believe that to be true, I held it up for a good 1/2 hour trying to test it, and it is actually quite heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all for the price you are paying (please don&#x27;t buy it at the regular price of $200.00, it should be in or around $50.00) it is a good blow dryer. If your like me and you want a professional blow dryer without the enormous hefty price tag I recommend the Twinturbo 3500 Professional Hair Dryer.</li>
    <li> Received quickly worked well for two months and then sparked where cord connects and died.  Was it refurbished marked as new?  Disappointing!!</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this product to match her flat iron set and she was very happy to receive it.  The item arrived on time</li>
    <li> I love it! Wonderful hair dryer! I was using a cheaper one from Walmart I will never use it again since I got this one!</li>
    <li> Mine is only a couple months  old and have only used it a few times and it caught fire and no longer turns on,,,I wish I could return it:(</li>
    <li> I am a bit disappointed it does not have a cold shot button but it works okay.</li>
    <li> Nice blow dryer, a little heavy and the handle is hard to hold without accidentally changing the settings. Other than that I like it.</li>
    <li> Had it for 3 months, loved it.. then the heat doesn&#x27;t blow heat no more. Blows out only cold air. So much for that!</li>
    <li> This dryer dries my hair in half the time of others I have used.  It is lightweight and comfortable to hold.  This is the second one I have purchased.</li>
