    <li> My niece loved it! Presentation and fragance.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my daughter for her birthday! She loves it and it was a great price for 3.4 oz!</li>
    <li> Really liked it, I always get compliments when I wear it.  I really recommend its one of my new favorites  .</li>
    <li> Love love love it ♡&lt;br /&gt;Come on time !</li>
    <li> Bought for daughter  she loves it!</li>
    <li> Best price out there.  For a &amp;#34;band&amp;#34; perfume this stuff smells pretty good and I don&#x27;t mind her wearing it.</li>
    <li> Great deal - huge bottle for a great price!</li>
    <li> Surprised how large the perfume bottle was!  Grand-daughter loved it.</li>
    <li> My niece loved it. Didn&#x27;t smell like old lady perfume. Very light scent appropriate for a young person. Floral and sweet smell.</li>
    <li> How can ANYTHING 1D be wrong :) very happy with my perfume</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter who loves One Direction.  She loves it!  Every time she walks by me and I notice her perfume smells really good and I ask her what she is wearing it is this, Our Moment.  It really does smell great, great enough that I&#x27;ve actually used some of it and would actually even buy it for myself. It has a long lasting scent. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe but sort of sweet smelling. She has told me that she gets lots of compliments when wearing it. I would say it&#x27;s not just for teens and would highly recommend this perfume.</li>
    <li> Very light scented.. Girly and perfect for teens.  Will be giving it to my 13 year old daughter.</li>
    <li> Great price and it arrived as planned</li>
    <li> I just purchased the gift set 3.4 oz. perfume, 5.1fl oz. lotion, an empty purse spray vial, small (probably an ounce size coffee cup with red hearts all over it with a cushioned rose hot clued to it) for $39.99 locally however I love it and will use it sparingly. Heck I used my stash funds to get it and.I can&#x27;t wait to wear to worship but mostly to work so heads can turn and mouths flop open ....hahahaha..</li>
    <li> Huge bottle for the price &amp; it smells so good, not to overwhelming, i&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. It is a nice light scent.</li>
    <li> Good price and delivery time</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my 13 year old daughter and she loves it. I like the price. :)</li>
    <li> She loved it! Great value, more perfume and half the cost!</li>
    <li> Very nice, wife liked it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter because she&#x27;s a fan and requested it.  i expected some horrible drug store acohol-reeking stink, but I actually like it.  It smells like a floral cotton candy, and it&#x27;s wonderful!  I  bought a second bottle for her because I&#x27;ve come to associate it with her.</li>
    <li> Happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my niece and they love it. I love the smell too.</li>
    <li> This is a Christmas gift for my one directioner daughter 😊&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to see her face when she opens it !!!!</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loved it. Shipped quickly and in great packaging. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m not some crazy teenager but my niece likes the band group whatever and everything that has to do with them so if it&#x27;s good for her than its ok for me</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice light scent that doesn&#x27;t give me headache. That is important when buying fragrances for someone else. My daughter lives the scent and wears it everyday.</li>
    <li> Great  size  and  love  it</li>
    <li> Fragrance arrived on time and intact. Great fragrance and cute container. I had to quickly discard the box because it showed an overabundance of male photos and I did not want my lady friend to get the wrong message about usage.</li>
    <li> Greatt i receve it in very good condition, my child is very very happy, shipment was like i spected, great</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Strong, but not too strong.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Not too strong. Good price</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 13 yr old daughter and she loves it.</li>
    <li> lovely soft scent, recieved it fast too.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!  IT SMELLS SO ELEGANT.  ONE OF MY FAVORITES FOR SURE.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FRAGRANCE TO ANYONE....VERY CLASSY</li>
    <li> I really like this perfume! I&#x27;m definitely NOT a One Direction fan, but I smelled this perfume one day while looking around and loved it. This was also the cheapest place I have found it! yay!</li>
    <li> Pretty pricy for a small bottle...also its unreturnable...dont buy</li>
    <li> just what my daughter wanted.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter who of course loves 1D; however, after one spray I wanted  a bottle for myself.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a &amp;#34;little girl&amp;#34; perfume.  It is light and luxurious.  The style of the bottle itself made her feel like a princess.&lt;br /&gt;It is beautiful to sit on her vanity.  Worth  EVERY single shilling!</li>
    <li> very good,i bought this for my wife she loves it thank you very much.i  recommend that anybody who needs this to buy it.</li>
    <li> yes thanks my neice loves it wears everyday still thanks me.gave it to her for christmas.dont know what else to say</li>
    <li> I received many compliments on this scent. It&#x27;s one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> Love the soft fragrance.  Most perfumes and colognes don&#x27;t agree with me.  This one is awesome!</li>
    <li> gave this as a gift and she loves it. a bit pricey but the fragrance is light and very nice for a young girl</li>
    <li> My daughter is a huge fan of 1D so this was an easy buy for her for Xmas. I have smelled the perfume and have to say I was surprised how  nice it was (Note: I do have a favorite that I have been using for almost 30 years so I am loyal to that perfume, L&#x27;Air du Temps, and would rate anything else as less than perfection).  Bottom line, she loves this, she&#x27;s happy and that&#x27;s the point, right??</li>
    <li> Awesome, wife loved it, win, win!!</li>
    <li> Strictly for 1 D fans...recipient loved it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my 12-year old niece. Delivery was prompt, and packaging was beautiful. It&#x27;s smells good, but not too strong, so it&#x27;s perfect for a 12-year. She love One Direction and now she loves this perfume!</li>
    <li> It smells amazing. Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but I have searched and searched and searched and this is the best price for this perfume that I could fine. It arrived promptly. I am very, very pleased.</li>
    <li> Smells like Barbie perfume. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad. It just smells like a little girl&#x27;s perfume. I bought it because it had so many positive reviews.</li>
    <li> I love One Direction and I couldn&#x27;t wait to buy their perfume. I even told myself that  if I didn&#x27;t like it I was going to force myself to love it, but I didn&#x27;t have to because it is wonderful! One of my favorite perfumes ever. Also, don&#x27;t forget to buy One Direction&#x27;s latest album Midnight Memories!</li>
    <li> Even though I am a mom, and not a &#x27;Directioner&#x27;, this fragrance is a blend of soft and sweet.  It is my new favorite scent.  Too bad my 13 year old can&#x27;t share it with me--it&#x27;s all mine!</li>
    <li> Smells great and the packaging is cute. It&#x27;s nice for buying perfume on a budget.</li>
    <li> my daughter ask me for it when she find out about these parfum so i got it for her. And she just love it.</li>
    <li> My niece loves the scent of this parfum spray.</li>
    <li> The smell last for at least 20hrs or so. Its smells really good!</li>
    <li> I ordered this late on Dec. 23rd so it shipped on the 24th, and I chose the free shipping so I was told it would arrive between 8pm Dec. 30th and Jan. 4th, which was perfectly acceptable especially considering there would be no postal service on Christmas. Imagine my surprise when I woke up on Dec. 27th to see it had already arrived! Shipped from one side of the country to the other in less than 3 days for free? That&#x27;s unheard of. And the perfume was in perfect condition in the original packaging, like I had just picked it up at the store. The perfume itself is beautiful, both the fragrance and the bottle. I&#x27;ve never really bothered to wear perfume before because I&#x27;d never found one that &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34;, but I love this one and I&#x27;ll definitely be wearing it.</li>
    <li> I am so so so happy with it.  I love the bottle but I don&#x27;t have the similar experiences like the other reviews.</li>
    <li> It is a refreshing yet subtle aroma.  VERY NICE to wear for any occasion!  I would recommend purchasing this perfume!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> excellent buy, I am satisfied</li>
    <li> Bought for my granddaughter. She will absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> The perfume package and scent was amazing.</li>
    <li> Great sale, I loved the parfum,I&#x27;m probably going to buy it again,to a Directioner it&#x27;s amazing to have it :)</li>
    <li> mY DAUGHTER NEVER LEAVES HOME WITHOUT PUTTING ON HER PARFUM, SHE LOVES THE SMELL, AND SHE SMELLS VERY GOOD WITH IT.</li>
    <li> Ordering this perfume from amazon was the best thing we could have done.  The price was right and we had no problems with shipping.  This was a wonderfully positive experience.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> I got it for Christmas and I really love it not just because its One Direction but that helps...It smells like heaven to be honest!</li>
    <li> i loved everything about it!! The smell, the form, the cute letter from the boys. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> The birthday girl loved it.  So successful purchase.  I thought it was a bit heavy but what do grandmothers know.  The purpose was to make her happy and it did.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves One Direction.  This was a gift for Christmas.  Needless to say she is ecstatic with this parfum.</li>
    <li> Excellent for a teen.</li>
    <li> Found it cheaper here than I did at sears ...my daughter loved it</li>
    <li> Smells so good  though it fades soon after</li>
    <li> It may be a little too sweet, but overall it smells very good.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My daughters favorite perfume!!! &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I love this spray and I always receive compliments for it.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves one direction. This perfume is in cutest bottle plus smells absolutely amazing! My daughter loves it. Definitely worth the money :) good job boys!</li>
    <li> Bought it for granddaughter for Christmas. She loves it. That makes a grandma happy. Usually at the teenage years they don&#x27;t like anything you buy them. This was a winner.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves it ❤❤❤</li>
    <li> A gift for my daughter, but it smells sooooo good!!  I may have to sneak into it from time to time.  :D</li>
    <li> Awesome purchase... Great Deal cant beat the price... well packaged and came when expected... Love it !!!!!</li>
    <li> daughter wears this every day and loves it</li>
    <li> It smells great!!!!!!! I&#x27;m so glad I got this!!! I really love this! It is wonderful and it smells really great!</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful, my daughter loves it, it last on you all day.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my granddaughter for Christmas and she was so happy! She told me that it was one the gifts she wanted the most this year. Thank!</li>
    <li> was a little expensive but it smells good and arrived before expected date. Most importantly my daughter loves it so I would recommend this fragrance to any one.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! It smells amazing!! I receive a lot of compliments every time I wear it!!</li>
    <li> for my granddaughter ok....</li>
    <li> Got it for my Granddaughter and she was thrilled!!  You did a great job!</li>
    <li> GREAT BUY, WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN FROM SELLER.</li>
    <li> When I received the perfume it was beautifully packaged in wrapping paper for Christmas(which I did not pay extra for) and the box was filled with packing peanuts to make sure it didn&#x27;t break. However when I opened my perfume it had a chip in the glass but it didn&#x27;t leak. Also, I believe this perfume is not authentic because when you take the cap of the spray thing should have a metal piece around it(shown in photo) which it does not have. Overall the perfume smells good.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves, loves, loves it</li>
    <li> Am so impressed, it smells really good. Am definitely buying another bottle soon. And the smell last for so long. For the price it&#x27;s actually worth it.</li>
    <li> Daughter loved it!  Smells very nice.  Not too strong.</li>
    <li> This perfume was a special request from my daughter. This product turned out to be a Great Christmas gift this year!</li>
    <li> our moment is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo great you don&#x27;t even have to be a directioner to love this perfume.  I&#x27;m a directioner this fragrance is per fect</li>
    <li> We got these for our grand daughters. They loved them. The packaging was great and when our kids and grandkids are this pleased, they have to be a good product.</li>
    <li> First of all, I love the smell of this perfume - sweet and not too strong.  I am very satisfied by the price of this item on Amazon, as well as the quick delivery time and brand new packaging. (Previously I spent $60 in a department store although it was a smaller bottle.) Thank You!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell.. Hate that it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> Came in at the right time.&lt;br /&gt;Well well wrapped&lt;br /&gt;it is phenomenal&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a scent/fragrance.</li>
    <li> I recently became addicted to smelling nice and wearing perfume but was clueless as to what fragrance to buy. So I went to Ulta to test out a bunch of perfumes. Surprisingly, One Direction&#x27;s Our Moment stood out among popular ones like Lancome, Versace and Chanel, just to mention a few. It was the one I chose to spray on my wrists and neck before leaving the store--and I was not disappointed with my choice. I even went back to buy it the same day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fresh, light and flowery with just a nice hint of sweetness. Very feminine and not too overpowering when you put it on right and you can definitely wear it out on a fun date or to work. However, while &amp;#34;Our Moment&amp;#34; is nice when you want to smell girly and pretty, it doesn&#x27;t have that wow factor of a more mature or edgier fragrance that demands attention. Being the (cheap) scientist that I pretend to be, I decided to experiment OM with a homemade vanilla fragrance oil that I bought awhile back. I dabbed the oil behind my ears and wrists and let it set for 5 minutes before spraying on OM. Holy smokes, I kid you not, the smell was absolutely devine. The two scents layered on top of each other gave it a more earthier musky smell. The people at my work-party complimented me like crazy and some even asked me what I was wearing to which I just smiled and acted all mysterious, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t guarantee that men will fall to your feet, OM + Vanille Oil does make (most) men lean in close into your personal space and tell you that you smell good. You have been warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I don&#x27;t rate it a 5 star is because the scent doesn&#x27;t last that on your skin. I can spray it on me at 9 in the morning and the smell will be gone by noon but it will stay on my clothes until the next day. I love the scent though and plan to buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> It smells really nice. very lights. good for young gril.</li>
    <li> Got it, smelled great in it, also dont listen to the &amp;#34;for women&amp;#34; stuff, im a guy, i smell fabulous, makes me confident, case closed!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter. it was one of the 2 things my 15 yr old wanted for Christmas and it was priced right. if I bought it in the store I would have paid the same amount for half the size. Love Amazon!  and it smells wonderful too!</li>
    <li> My daughter almost jumped thru the ceiling when she saw this at Christmas.. and surprisingly enough, I like the scent, also... not too sweet and the bottle is adorable</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.  Not to strong. Scent is nice. Will be purchasing again. This was worth the cost.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Love it! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Bought this perfume for my daughter. She loved it, I thought it smelled really nice also.</li>

    <li> I loved this!! Only con to this is it only lasted about 2 months :(.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for 13 year old granddaughter. It is very pretty bottle.  She said it was exactly what she wanted.  Everyone&#x27;s happy!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my 9 year old niece and she loved it! It smelled awesome. I would even wear it myself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great size and smells amazing</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my niece for Christmas.  She absolutely freaked out over it.  The bottle was just as pretty as the picture and came in a glossy 1D box.  She said it smelled like a piece of heaven, so defiantly 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Nice, very soft and in obtrusive fragrance with a desirable bottle.  We are seniors and I ordered this with no knowledge of who, or what, &amp;#34;One Direction&amp;#34; was.  At first I was dismayed to know I had ordered a &amp;#34;boy-group&amp;#34; perfume for my wife of 52 years--but, after seeing and smelling the order, I am both relieved and pleased with the product.  It is a delicate and subtle scent and we like it.</li>
    <li> the delivery was too fast and good quality</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells. I usually use issy maik. And this one is that great too. I bought the gift set which smells great altogether. Everyone comments on how good it smells.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my daughter.  Bet she will love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my teenage daugher and she loved it!</li>
    <li> One of the best smelling perfumes of all times</li>
    <li> Smells great!! Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> the smell does not feel</li>
    <li> I really like this perfume...I know, it&#x27;s a One Direction product but it&#x27;s pretty awesome stuff!  For the big bottle, it&#x27;s cheaper here than any of the department stores we have around.</li>
    <li> Great price for a a gift.</li>
    <li> Best price we could find. This is a huge bottle. Should last at least a week..</li>
    <li> Fast shipment and good quality.</li>

    <li> Gave as gift and she loved it</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my only daughter. She had never tested it and really likes it after receiving and using it.</li>
    <li> A teen who loves One Direction got her wish for Christmas.  I have to say, I was impressed by the stylish design and the aroma of this perfume.  All came in timely and perfect.  Thanks</li>
    <li> My daughter is a true Directioner and wanted/needed it! She loves it! A+ !! It&#x27;s a lovely scent for young ladies.</li>

    <li> exactly what my granddaughter wanted.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it!</li>

    <li> My daughter absolutely loves this perfume</li>
    <li> Way better than I had hoped for. Get nice compliments whenever I  wear it.</li>
    <li> I bought Our Moment for my wife on Valentines day and she loved it. She never leaves the house without spraying some on her body. If you want to please your wife then buy a bottle and surprise her.</li>
    <li> Well packaged, beautiful bottle, light fragrant smell. My granddaughter loved it. I would recommend. It makes a great girls gift as their first bottle of perfume to remember.</li>
    <li> I received the product well everything was perfect for the next opportunity so take this into account follow thank you very much</li>
    <li> Came with a slightly messed up edge and I&#x27;m almost certain that it isn&#x27;t original because the coloring was almost orange as well as the smell wasn&#x27;t really spot on</li>
    <li> came in very good condition, 100% recommended, My daughter loves him, A very good perfume, One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made! :D</li>
    <li> This smells really good and I am not a teenager</li>
    <li> Bought it for a family member and they loved it.</li>
    <li> I could not decide whether to purchase Our Moment or That Moment by One Direction.  I chose Our Moment as it has a soft scent which I enjoy.  My next purchase will be That Moment as I would like to switch off scents.  That moment is a little more outspoken and I would like to step out of my box and enjoy the Moment in a matter of speaking.  I would definitely recommend the purchasing of Our Moment.</li>
    <li> Bigger than expected.  Very good purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my niece, but I love it too!</li>

    <li> My wife was very happy with the scent and the nice bottle.</li>
    <li> Good but it came late</li>

    <li> Bought all 3 of the one direction perfumes and was not disappointed at all I would wear all three myself</li>
    <li> Amazing.  I absolutely love this perfume</li>
    <li> This fragrance is amazing! I went to Macy&#x27;s to smell it, but they didn&#x27;t have it in stock. This is almost half the price, so I decided to just buy it, because you can never go wrong with One Direction! Obviously, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I&#x27;ve never smelled a perfume that I truly loved until now! It smells so wonderful, and it makes me so happy every time I wear it... which is every day. :) The bottle is beautiful as well and looks lovely on my French-themed bureau. I already received loads of compliments--from people who weren&#x27;t even One Direction fans!  I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with my perfume. The perfect combination of sweet, fruity, and floral. Thank you One Direction and Amazon Prime! &lt;3  (Also, if you haven&#x27;t seen the ad for this perfume, you must! It is so adorable...)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;7fNuTf76FlE</li>
