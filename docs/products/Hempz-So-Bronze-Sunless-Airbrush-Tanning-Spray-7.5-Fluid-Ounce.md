      <li>One of the most natural tones out there!</li>
      <li>The nozzle&#x27;s are not working right anymore.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product right away.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and very natural looking...</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t waste the whole bottle on legs, but if you are out of options it works great on those areas too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I like very much how this goes on, but it is a tiny bit too orange.  </li>
      <li>I will go back to using this product once I get a more even &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; coat with my other self tanning product I use with no problems which are the Tan Towels.  </li>
      <li>I was able to stand in a separate, deep tub to apply, but still had to rinse and wipe down the tube afterwards.</li>
      <li>This gives me a natural looking tan.</li>
      <li>30 min before bed scrub skin with hot water and an exfoliating brush or body scrubber, apply spray, let dry, shower in the morning and then use a moisturizing lotion before getting dressed to help maintain color.</li>
      <li>I became hooked on this when I was pregnant and feeling pale.</li>
      <li>Slight smell at first if at all.  </li>
      <li>Only thing to mention is that the stuff goes on fairly clear so be careful to not spray the same spot too much.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> One of the most natural tones out there!</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of self-tanning sprays and creams. This one seems to be the best. The most anti-orange color yet. Very delicious smell (like coconut rum). Also sprays upside down! Only thing to mention is that the stuff goes on fairly clear so be careful to not spray the same spot too much. I usually apply it with gloves on till my skin looks wet then rub it in, then remove the gloves and spray the backs of the hands. Also, you need to EXFOLIATE before applying!!! I can&#x27;t stress that enough! I apply as such with great success: 30 min before bed scrub skin with hot water and an exfoliating brush or body scrubber, apply spray, let dry, shower in the morning and then use a moisturizing lotion before getting dressed to help maintain color.</li>
    <li> great product for a great price. Even coverage, does not streak, does not turn you orange. Nice tan color. Last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a great bronzer.</li>
    <li> This spray is awesome. I keep buying it. So easy to use and does not make your skin orange. Looks like a real tan. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Loved this! Perfect color and sprayed evenly</li>
    <li> This product does not work on fair skinned people- AT ALL.  I looked like I whiped fudge on my leg, it was brown for sure- no orange, but come on.  I do not want to look like a chocolate bunny.  NOT for FAIR SKIN AT ALL!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I tried to return since it didn&#x27;t work for me and the seller would not let me return because they said the can would explode in the mail-- hmmm, they were able to send it to be in the mail no problem!  Ugh, another $30 down the drain.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this body mist instant brozer spray. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it, I use it on my face every morning and my neck, arms, chest, if my outfit calls for bronzed upper body. Wouldn&#x27;t waste the whole bottle on legs, but if you are out of options it works great on those areas too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend trying this! It does have a bit of a \\&quot;tanner\\&quot; smell, but its more subtle than most others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Gives a really natural looking color and is easy to apply.  The reason for 4 starts is simply because when I used this (regardless of what scrub / exfoliation I used) my legs looked streaky.  It&#x27;s probably &amp;#34;operator error&amp;#34; because I&#x27;ve never used an aerosol self tanner before.  I will go back to using this product once I get a more even &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; coat with my other self tanning product I use with no problems which are the Tan Towels.  The only other draw back is that when using this spray it does seem to leave a coating on nearby surfaces.  I was able to stand in a separate, deep tub to apply, but still had to rinse and wipe down the tube afterwards.</li>
    <li> If you like Orange.. then great..</li>
    <li> Great product, great seller</li>
    <li> This gives me a natural looking tan. I&#x27;m southeast asian and I tan naturally but slowly so whenever I want to get darker instant, I use this product ( This product is not for people with pale skin). I hope they continue to make this bronzer, because it&#x27;s really good.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used! little to no smell after wearing it throughout the day. buying more!!</li>
    <li> Love it and so easy to use and great even coverage</li>
    <li> My friend was using the tanner on her face. I thought she went tanning.  I ordered this product right away. It smells pretty and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. Love it!</li>
    <li> The pump is clogged on both cans I want a refund.  I love the bronzer but I was sooo disappointed that both cans the pump is broken wont spray</li>
    <li> This product is so easy to use and fits my purposes. Easy to apply and dries quickly. This way your&#x27;re not exposing your skin to dangerous untra violet rays. A safe way to get a tan. I would recommend this to others</li>
    <li> I Loved this before the last 2 bottles were wasted because the nozzle got clogged up.  I wish I could figure out how to contact the manufacturer so I can get 2 bottles for free that have nozzles that work.  Does anyone know exactly who the manufacturer is?</li>
    <li> so easy!  lasts longer than I thought.  You can make it darker or lighter depending on how close you hold the can to your body.  Slight smell at first if at all.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have tried about everything out there and this is the BEST self tanner I have ever used. I spray it all over and rub it in,in circular motions with a tanning mit. Its the most natural color,streak free. No wrist or ankle funk. Its just awesome!</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; shipping</li>
    <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave an orange tone.  Great bronzing spray!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, it never has that orange look like other self Tanners have. I became hooked on this when I was pregnant and feeling pale. I get lots of compliments on my skin color... I have a little bit of a darker complexion so I don&#x27;t know how this would fair for lighter skin tones.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very natural looking...without the damaging sun rays!! Creates a glow! I will definitely use this often !</li>
    <li> This is a great product especially as a spray.  Best way to spray yourself is in the shower and with someone who can spray your back.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas.  She must like it a lot, because this is the type she always gets or asks for for gifts.</li>
    <li> I like very much how this goes on, but it is a tiny bit too orange.  I like it on my chest and arms but not on my legs.</li>
    <li> By far the best self tanner I have used. Does not make me orange, stinky or streaky. I&#x27;m impressed with how well it works.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Smells good and looks really natural on. Make sure to wear gloves though and to rub it in don&#x27;t just spray it on.</li>
    <li> Smells much better than others. Neutrogena gave me hives so severe - lasted  two weeks. So this safer product appreciated.</li>
    <li> The nozzle&#x27;s are not working right anymore. They get all backed up/clogged and spray spots, I hope they fix it soon before I find a new product.</li>
    <li> I use this product before heading out on vacation but remember there is no sunscreen in this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product it doesnt stain your hands no clothes its great if you want to look tanned all year around</li>
    <li> This is one of the best self-tanning products to use.  It doesn&#x27;t have a nasty smell and it is easy to apply.  It is so much cheaper to buy on line than in the store too.</li>
    <li> I have tried about everything on the market and this is absolutely, by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever found. Doesn&#x27;t streak and stays on for about 5 to 7 days.  Well worth the money!</li>
