<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is by far the best flat iron I&#x27;ve purchased for under $40. Smooth plates don&#x27;t pull your hair and it heats up quickly. However, given that this flat iron retails around $200, I was surprised at how cheap the flat iron&#x27;s components look and feel (e.g. the on/off switch). It appears that I may have to replace the iron sooner than I&#x27;d like. That&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  I&#x27;d recommend this flat iron if you find it for $45 or under. If you have to shell out more, skip it and look for something better.</li>
    <li> This product really lives up to it&#x27;s value. The flat irons leave my hair with bounce and gloss. I love it.</li>
    <li> iv been using it continuously for a few weeks now, the straightener is v good, but im scared of the damage to my hair</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this.  It works well and sutits her needs.  It is easy to store.  It is well made.</li>
    <li> I have REALLY naturally curly hair.  This was perfect to use to straighten my curls out.  It made my hair feel silky and smooth and it lasted a really long time before the plates chipped (I take really good care of my hair tools...keep them in original packaging).  I never was able to figure out how to curl my hair with it though (but then I didn&#x27;t really ever need to use that feature).</li>
    <li> Buyer beware!!!! I ordered this item being very excited that I was getting such a great iron at such a great price. ISO straighteners are one of the very best. But little did I know amazon is out to screw you over. I got three irons in a row that had the same issue. Wouldn&#x27;t turn on half the time and would never stay on. Faulty switches I&#x27;m pretty sure. After sending back and receiving 3 irons that had the exact same problem and many lies and false hope from amazon later, I came to the conclusion that amazon must have just gotten a whole supply of faulty irons and decided to sell them to their customers anyways. Way to go amazon. Do not be fooled into buying this iron.</li>
    <li> Still working :) after couple years</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair well and as soon as a stepped out my hair looked worse. I had to buy a different brand what a waste of money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with every straightener that I&#x27;ve tried because my hair is so fine. This one is amazing! The floating plates work so well with my fine that I was stunned at the results and it only cost just over 30 dollars! I couldn&#x27;t be more happier.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this on and off for 2 years. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Works great! Gets very hot! Very good quality item! Love that it has a adjustable temperature and an on-off light. I have bought many cheap-y straighteners from various stores and this is soo much great without being much more expensive!</li>
    <li> For all of you considering the ISO straightener, let me first say \\&quot;just get it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.\\&quot; Here&#x27;s why.  I have thick, bushy, wavy hair. I&#x27;ve found that the ISO straightener not only leaves my hair straight, but also soft and shiny. In addition to this, I&#x27;ve been using the same ISO straightener for 5 YEARS. Yes, 5 years. I believe these have a 3 year warranty? I should also mention that I&#x27;ve dropped my straightener a couple times, and even with the slightly broken plates, it still works. Clearly, the ISO straightener is superior when it comes to results, durability, and life expectancy.  I&#x27;m now purchasing ANOTHER ISO straightener as 5 years really is too long and my straightener needs a good break.</li>
    <li> I purchased TWO of these flat irons.  When I received yet another chipped plate on the iron I wrote a bad review.  Once the company saw my review they emailed me and told me they would be happy to replace BUT I must delete my bad review.  I did delete my review and have been waiting for my replacement.  GUESS WHAT?  These lying suckers keep telling me that my original review was still posted and I keep checking my amazon account and it is not showing.  The reality is this....the company LIED to get me to delete my bad review and they are NOT holding up to their end of the bargain.  The TWO irons I have received are CRAP.  Cracked and chipped plates!!!  I basically now have two paper weights!!!.  Not only does the iron suck but LUXURY COSMETICS are LIARS and DECEITFUL</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this straightener when she was at the salon.  The lady at the salon raved about what a great unit this was.  When I saw the price there I said \\&quot;no sale\\&quot;.  I went on Amazon and saved about 65% and got my daughter her favorite gift ever.  Now she takes it everywhere she goes.</li>
    <li> I give it 5 stars because the iron does exactly what the it describes to, it leaves my hair silky. Its the first time I use the brand but the reviews helped me decide. Not disappointed at all, great buy for the price. Will def. recommend &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love to straighten my hair,and if u do to then u should this straightener,also it cheep,useable,and nice and in good use</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> The hair iron works well. I think I need one that gets hotter in temp. Overall it is a good item for the money.</li>
    <li> This straightener does it&#x27;s job but there are definitely better ones or there.  You get exactly what you pay for.</li>
    <li> this is a very good quality straightening iron, I have very fine hair, and I can change the settings so that its not too hot. Still gets the job done, but I don&#x27;t have broken hair when I&#x27;m done. The heats up very quickly, in less than a minute. very good product for the price, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This must be a joke or something. I read all the previous reviews and it sounded like everyone else recieved the ISO straightner you see in the mall, right? Well I recieved this plastic peice of crap that had no on of switch, no temp control, the iron plates were plastic! I am contacting the seller immediately and sending it back. WTH! I will update my post as soon as I get this figured out! ANNOYED!</li>
    <li> I think it is wonderful. I had a smaller one that didn&#x27;t do a good job. This one is great and dies a great job on my hair.</li>
    <li> This is unbelievable for the price. My wife has another one exactly that was over $100.00 at the mall. Great straightner.</li>
    <li> I upgraded to this Iso from a cheap Remington product that had lasted me about two years until one of its plates had stopped heating, so this was immediately an improvement over what I was used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The design is functional, sturdy, and easy to hold, and the plates heat up very quickly after flicking the on switch. My fine hair looks almost professionally smooth when finished, I have to say. The cord is surprisingly long, and the carrying case that came with it is kind of useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The temperature dial is a little too easy to move for my liking. My hair sometimes gets pulled by the flat iron when I take a section that is slightly too large, causing occasional pain and breakage. Nothing too major, but it&#x27;s something I haven&#x27;t experienced as often with other professional-style flat irons when I&#x27;ve used them in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the insanely low price, this is a great buy for anyone looking to upgrade from cheap straighteners to something more solid.</li>
    <li> Catches on your hair some. Thought it would be better quality.</li>
    <li> The plates are not smooth and catch and pull my hair. I quit using it because it it was breaking off the ends of my hair since the plates were rough. Was excited I was getting an expensive straightener for an amazing price...But I I would have been better off buying the cheapest one at Walmart than buying this one.</li>
    <li> I am using this product . It&#x27;s really wonderful worth buying product. I suggest to everyone but try to check it again before sending..lit bit scraches are there.</li>
    <li> I live in an extremely humid part of the country. I have tried many flat irons but to not avail I was still fighting fizz after straightening my hair. This iron keeps my hair straight and frizz free!</li>
    <li> update: one of the heating plates ended up burning out. I was ok with it because these are so cheap I just bought another one but it suck not being able to use my straightener for a week. Still good when it works tho.  Perfect hair straightener.  Some of these high end ones don&#x27;t come with the temperature option and I&#x27;m glad this one does.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny. It works amazingly and not only does the job but also makes my hair look more shiny</li>
    <li> The straightener was decent. It did a great job straightening my hair and keeping it straight. It also did a good job with loose curls.  I gave it three stars because the plates had discolored spots and it pulled at the ends of several strands of hair (some hairs were pulled out of my scalp). I returned it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron for my daughter as she has been asking for a flat iron for quite a while.  I purchased this flat iron based on the price and the reviews I&#x27;ve read.  So far, she is really liking it and it does a great job straightening her hair.  For the price, it is definitely a great deal!</li>
    <li> This is my second one. I Dropped the first one. Has a good range of heat on the control. Heats up fast</li>
    <li> great item at a great price. my girl uses it all the time when she is doing her hair or her friends hair</li>
    <li> I really like this straightener except when I was straightening my hair the heat strips get caught on your hair and it can be kind of painful but other than that it works really well.</li>
    <li> Because I&#x27;m a African american female, and, this idem didn&#x27;t reach the right temputure for my hair. My hair was not straight</li>
    <li> Do not buy it... i only used it twice and the first time my hair was great but then it looked like it was rusty i used it bc my hair had to be straight that day and it seems like it was ripping off my hair...</li>
    <li> The straightener itself worked well, but a piece fell off as soon as I opened it. It was aesthetic, but it&#x27;s looks cheap because of it.</li>
    <li> Works great and heats up fast.  I love how easy it is to use since I never leave enough time in the morning.</li>
    <li> I chose this straightener on recommendation of my hair stylist.&lt;br /&gt;Although she paid two an a half times more than I did.  She also decided to buy a secoun one at this price.  I love that the sides of the plate heat so you can also curl if you would like to.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what i expected.</li>
    <li> I love the hair straighter.it works great! I like it better then the one I had before which was chi.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I am looking for.  The device is easy to use and my hair is nice and straight!</li>
    <li> Stopped working after the second time she turned it on... Had to purchase another straight iron just to get her through until we get the Ulta...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Wife and she likes it. Her only complaint is that she would like it to get hotter. Overall, it does what it is supposed to do and works just fine.</li>
    <li> i bought this straightener and had no high expectations.  I have bought the 200.00 and up straighteners for along time,  But they do not compare to this one.  I have very curly natural hair and frizzy beyond what it should be.  This flat iron is the best one I have ever used.  I will only use this brand ever!!! great price ! great flat iron</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my ISO (This same exact model) for almost 5 years and it still works perfect! I bought mine in the mall for over $100 and the only thing I&#x27;d say that would be wrong with it is that its 5 years old, lol. It&#x27;s starting to smell like burnt hair which I could probably still deal with, but for this price I ordered a new one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a CHI a couple of years ago and HATED it compared to this one. I have thick curly hair and it works wonders! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> So far so good I only used it once so far but I think it&#x27;s great no complaints over here</li>
    <li> Heats very quickly and the plates leaves all textures of hair soft and silky. Curls well too! On con is I wish it got a little hotter but it still gets pretty hot, as a beautician im aware that it takes time for your heating utensils to be &amp;#34;sesasoned&amp;#34; but still heats great! Would buy again...great price!</li>
    <li> Good quality hair straightener. I love it so much, I actually bought one for each of my sisters too!</li>
    <li> I feel bad saying this but I truly hate this straightener. I was so excite by the discounted price and not wanting to spend $100 on a chi but it&#x27;s not worth the grief! This thing pulls my hair the whole time and doesn&#x27;t even get that hot! I&#x27;ll be buying a chi to replace this and I&#x27;ll consider this lesson learned! You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener as a replacement to a cheap, Revlon brand straightener. The reviews on this Iso made it look like it was at least the same quality as the CHI, which I&#x27;ve owned before, but for less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it not heat up very hot (my Revlon got hotter), it takes forever to straighten my already fairly straight hair with this product. It&#x27;s also rather heavy, which given how much time it takes to use makes it very cumbersome. It&#x27;s an exhausting process using this straightener and I would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> It was a good purchase. I love flat irons.</li>
    <li> Ok but pulls hair a little bit. Does get hot but might be worth paying a little more for next level of flat iron. I had one from this brand that worked well for about 5 years and cost $50.</li>
    <li> After less than two months of occasional use, the plates are discolored and look like they won&#x27;t hold up for much longer.</li>
    <li> So I got bought two ISO ceramic straighteners at mall of America. The first one, my daughters stopped working after 30 days. I tried to return it, but they wanted 30 dollars for shipping.  Short in the cord. Today I plugged mine in and have had to wiggle the cord to get it to start. As I was trying to correct the short it blew up in my face. The cord completely had an electrical shock and started on fire, burnt my shirt, caused injury to my eyes, and the iron and cord completely separated.  Do not buy this product. I have an appt with my eye dr tomorrow to see if the electrical volt has damaged my vision. My shirt has burn marks on it fire.</li>
    <li> My old flat iron broke so I had been using a cheap replacement, but it took hours for me to straighten my hair and after I would finish I was never satisfied and had to keep my hair in a ponytail. Then I bought the Iso Beauty Flat Iron, and the difference is huge. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money I spent. I was done quicker and the results are perfect.</li>
    <li> This iron lasted me 3months and then it stopped getting hot. Do not waste your money on this</li>
    <li> Bought for granddaughters to give to their mother for Christmas and they all loved it.  Works great.  Highly recommended item.</li>
    <li> i bought it for my wife than i had to buy it for my mom and sister because it is a good product</li>
    <li> Excellent price at $24! Glides very smoothly and does not snag my hair at all. Doesn&#x27;t seem all that hot to be honest, but it works find as long as I glide it through my hair a little slower than I&#x27;m used to. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out and my hair feels and looks healthy when I use it. I haven&#x27;t tried to use it to curl.</li>
    <li> This straightener is not the best but it gets the job done.  The switch doesn&#x27;t work that well so I always make sure it&#x27;s unplugged instead of simply switching it to the off position.</li>
    <li> The ceramic plates were scratched right out of the box. I could tell it was a low quality item right away. I&#x27;ve only been using it about two months and the plates have this awful charred residue and it smells like something is burning each time I turn it on. I tried using rubbing alcohol and a cotton ball like I have with other straighteners in the past to clean the plates but the plates are literally charred. There&#x27;s no hope for cleaning. I was going to return it but I just bought a new one from another store. I would NEVER recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair straightener.  This flat iron does not pull hair at all, especially very fine hair. A+!  This was a great buy and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Work just as well as all those expensive mall products</li>
    <li> Let me first start by saying I never leave reviews but this iron was so awful I had to let you know....Don&#x27;t waste your money!!! I have wavy hair and have the Chi iron for years. I was at the mall and there was a booth selling these and told me how much better it was for my hair and works better than the Chi, give me a break!!! My armpits get hotter than this...DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY...SPEND THE EXTRA FEW DOLLORS AND GET THE CHI!!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this straightener.  I have always just purchased the mid-priced straighteners from Target and finally decided to go with a better brand.  I am so mad I didn&#x27;t purchase this sooner.  It heats up instantly and goes up to 410 degrees.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple months so the jury is still out on it&#x27;s long term use, but for the price on amazon, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Even better than expected for the price!</li>
    <li> One of the plates would not heat after having this product for only 6 months.  I previously had and ISO flat iron that last me over five years.  I want to believe Amazon products are defective.</li>
    <li> I loved this iron at first, but it didn&#x27;t even last me a year. The ceramic iron chipped and then I plugged in the iron one day and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. The iron itself fried. I will not be purchasing this brand ever again.</li>
    <li> I was very happy when I first bought this product in April 2011. I thought it worked so much better than all the previous flat irons I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. However, after less than 8 months of use, it no longer works (i.e., it doesn&#x27;t even turn on anymore). I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t pay the full price on this item. I don&#x27;t think I would buy this particular brand again.</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for years and is still just as good as the day my mother got it for me!  It takes my hair from being large and puffy to neat and straight!</li>
    <li> Love.  Heats up fast and works really well!  I have ethnic hair and this works very well.</li>
    <li> I bought thus hair staighter a couple months ago and I dont like to give reviews until I am sure about the products and I hated it! It takes long to to heat up, horrible to curl hair, and when i pass the straingter through my hair its not a smooth passing. It get stuck on your hair on its way down. And i thought i was making a good buy with all this good review and I was going to buy Babyliss or CHI but the review of ISO strainghter won me over. Now I have to buy a new one! THats why cheap come outmexpmsive because i waisted money twice!</li>
    <li> Great straighener! I have been using this product for more than 5 years and it is just as great as the CHI or maybe even better!! And the price is remarkably cheaper.  Will definitely continue to purchase. Leaves the hair smooth and non frizzy. I have curly hair and love this product.</li>
    <li> The picture you see above is NOT the flat iron you will receive. The plates are different they are black and NOT the cream/gold color as it appears. The flat iron I previously owned was the exact one in the picture but it broke so I figured I could find one Amazon. I use this flat iron to curl my hair because it works just as good as a wand but of course that is my opinion. Point is IT IS NOT THE SAME FLAT IRON.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product and service...I S O PROFESSIONAL CERAMIC HAIR STRAIGHTENER came in great shape and BEFORE estimated date!!! Also costed way less than the same exact ones in the mall!!!</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd flat iron that I have owned.  I bought it because of good reviews and the price.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I have owned this flat iron for about 6 months or more and it gets very hot very fast.  The plates also seem sturdy and my hair does not get caught on any part of this flat iron.  It glides smoothly down my hair leaving it straight.  Although it gets hot, it does not reach the \\&quot;too hot\\&quot; point where smoke comes off my hair (thank goodness).  On occasion, I do accidentally turn it off in the middle of straightening my hair because of where the switch is positioned but that&#x27;s only on occasion.  I also like the really long cord so if the vanity only has one plug, it should reach across your space just fine.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that this flat iron works well...my only concern is that when I received this item it looked a little used. But other than that it works great.</li>
    <li> This is such a good price for this straightener! It grabs your hair so tightly and straightens so nicely! This product costs well over 200 dollars in store..so this price is such a steal!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the iron from about a month now and it works like a dream. Heats up very fast and leaves my hair very smooth. Even works to steam iron wet hair. Haven&#x27;t tried it out for any curling yet, but I&#x27;m really liking it and hoping this will last me for years to come. Shipping was extremely fast too, which was a blessing for my dreaded cow-lick.</li>
    <li> I chose this because i like this product and because it was a great price! I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product! Works amazing and makes hair smooth!</li>
    <li> I bought this same one at one of those mall kiosks 4 years ago. However it was starting to not work as well as it used to. I went back because I lost my receipt. They wanted $260 for a new one, holy cow! So I went home and found this one on amazon. Seriously the best flat iron ever, and it leaves your hair super soft after you are done straightening it. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Very good item,&lt;br /&gt;still like it a lot and would buy it again&lt;br /&gt;Hope you will enjoy it, as well!</li>
    <li> This iron is ok for the price.  One thing is its very heavy, I also did&#x27;nt like not having a light on the iron to tell me it was on you have to really pay attention you dont leave it on.  I have not had it long enough to see how long it will last will see.  but for the price its ok.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it, value at $200 but was able to get it at a great deal and works very well. Recommend to those who don&#x27;t want to come out of pocket to much and still get that professional look.</li>
    <li> Can you believe that those mall kiosks are still in business?? One kiosks sold my wife this EXACT same unit for $299!! I eventually forced them to take it back and give me my money back, (It took a lot of work, but I was successful). When you see that wonderful product at the mall, check amazon first, you will DEFINITELY save a lot of money.</li>
    <li> I just recently bought this to replace a straightener for my daughter, so far this straightener is great, heats up fast, fast working, &amp; didn&#x27;t leave my hair as static clingy as the last 1 did, I wish the temp adjuster was more permanent as it can easily get lowered by using the straightener, but other than that I love it</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with my new straightner.  Thank you.  My hair is very curly and it just straightens it out so nicely.</li>
    <li> A very good product. My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I have literally used this product for over 5 years. I bought it originally for a whole lot more than this price. It is by far the best one I have found. I use it to straighten and curl my hair. Last night my sister dropped mine and broke the ceramic of it (mind you, I have dropped it for the past 5 years many many times!). It was finally time to replace it. I went to TJ Maxx and bought a $30 one and it was horrible. It kept ripping my hair, getting stuck, and allowing me to curl my hair with it. I went back and exchanged it for a CHI. It was good, but I just love the one I had before and decided to just but the same one again!</li>
    <li> Bought this straightener for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  My daughter says it doesn&#x27;t take as long to straighten her hair and it stays straight longer.</li>
    <li> Lives your hair silky with a beautiful  natural look.&lt;br /&gt;Love it&lt;br /&gt;ives your hair silky with a beautiful  natural look.  I impressed with it&lt;br /&gt;Lives you  silky with a beautiful  natural look.&lt;br /&gt;The best product, I&#x27;m very impressed with it Love it</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, has a setting up to 450 degrees and feels heavy and durable.&lt;br /&gt;the cord connected to the straightener turns where it meets so it doesnt tangle up like the other hair straighteners.&lt;br /&gt;cant beat it for tis price.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome straightener I use it to curl my straight hair and calm flyaways. It&#x27;s a great bargain and works as well as other expensive straigtheners.. it also doesn&#x27;t snag... BIG PLUS!</li>
    <li> Wife has said that this is one of the best gifts that I have bought her. She uses it multiple times a day and it works well for her. She has stated that it is by far the best one she has ever had.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of straighteners. I used to use them all the time at a mall because I worked at one of those kiosks. I can honestly say they are amazing quality. They cost so much at the mall and I looked them up on Amazon and was pleasantly surprised to find them so cheap here! Definitely worth it. Save some money, but know you&#x27;re getting quality!</li>
    <li> Non slip straightener that works well. It heats up quickly also. I can use it to straighten my hair or bend the iron a little on the ends for a curly affect.</li>
    <li> very good option to purchase the gift I made for my sister has very good deals for buyers who do not have time to go to commercial certros.</li>
    <li> Did not work well on my coarse, thick hair. No automatic shut off or digital settings. I&#x27;m sticking with my Remington flat irons from now on as they leave my hair much smoother and shinier, heat up very quickly and the automatic shut off leaves me with peace of mind in the morning when I leave for work.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME I SAVED SO MUCH MONEY I RECOMMEND FOR FUTURE PURCHASES!!! 100% RELIABLE!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M SO GLAD I FOUND IT!</li>
    <li> Love,Love and Love it! Have bought other brands before.Some that are well known brands.This product however preforms everything and deliver&#x27;s results just as stated on product description.Trust in Amazon came through #1. Again!</li>
    <li> great product no problem so far great deal very nice cuality  and great deal compared to others i saw 1</li>
    <li> Great product!  Fast, even heating and a nice smooth barrel. I like that the edge is a bit rounded off, so I can flip my hair out or curl it under. For this price, it&#x27;s a steal. Comparable to much more expensive flat irons.</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and I use this, I prefer it over the one I have.  It does a very good job on both our hair.  She has very long hair with a slight wave in it.  Mine is shoulder length with a lot of natural wave in it and it can get it straight.  I do wish the on/off switch was in a different location.  I don&#x27;t really like that it is sandwiched between the plates -- it always feels a little hazardous when I need to turn it off to be putting my finger between two very hot plates.</li>
    <li> takes a little bit longer then my Conair infinity pro to heat up, plates get dirty easily even with clean hair</li>
    <li> temp could be higher doesn&#x27;t flatten that great</li>
    <li> I read the good reviews about this product.  It claimed in the product description and features the same as that of high end, expensive brands and reliable hair straightener flat irons in the market,  so I tried it.  So far I&#x27;m happy.  It heats fast in ten seconds and adds luster to my hair which I always want. I would recommend for those who are not ready to spend so much like me.</li>
    <li> Have had this staightener for years now and it still works wonderfully and never pulls my hair.</li>
    <li> Great price and works beautifully.  I had one just like this for I think almost 10 years before it wasn&#x27;t working up to par (though my daughter still uses it.)  This one is even better.  On my thick, wavy hair...it&#x27;s fast and smooth. Love it!</li>
    <li> works great on my wavy-to-curly hair, has on/off button and you can adjust temperatures too. it&#x27;s dual voltage (110-240), so no problem to use it in Europe (where i am).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;heats fast, very easy to use; my hair remains straight even in humid weather. absolutely would recommend this!</li>
    <li> I brought this product thinking it would be a replacement for another flat iron I had. I was disppointed that it did not provide the same shine as my other one and the plates did not slide smoothly on the hair. I have curly hair maybe this would work better for straight hair needing to control fly aways.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product around 6 months ago after both of my daughters had a demonstration at the mall and wanted one. They have told me that the price here on Amazon is considerably cheaper for the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this straightener. I have owned many others in the past and they all seemed to fall short of my expectations. I have full long thick hair and with the ISO I can straighten my hair in about half the time as the others. I am also able to use this iron to curl my hair and style it in other ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get one!</li>
    <li> My favorite CHI flat iron finally died after 3 years of consistent use. I have a Sedu 2\\&quot; flat iron that works perfectly, but I was looking for an affordable replacement for my 1\\&quot; flat iron. This Iso Beauty flat iron did NOT live up to the reviews. My hair is medium-thick and naturally frizzy/curly. I&#x27;m used to an extra-hot flat iron that takes one pass, maybe two to straighten hair. The Iso Beauty took several passes to straighten my hair that would easily have straightened with the CHI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like to curl my hair with a 1\\&quot; flat iron by taking a section of hair and positioning the flat iron at the top. I glide it down a few inches, then flip the flat iron around 180 degrees so the ends of the hair are facing straight up. Gliding the flat iron the rest of the way down and feeding the ends of the hair through the plates usually results in a soft, lasting curl. The Iso Beauty flat iron just didn&#x27;t work for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be returning my Iso flat iron in favor of a different brand.</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail very fast (so that was a plus) but I was very disappointed in the product.  I took it out of the packaging and plugged it in to see how fast it heated up, and when I clicked the on switch, the light went on for a few seconds and then went right off.  I thought maybe thats just how it worked, so I left it plugged in and went back a few minutes later and it wasn&#x27;t hot at all.  I thought maybe it was the outlet so I tried resetting the outlet and tried plugging it in to other ones, and it didn&#x27;t turn on at all.  For how great this straightener is supposed to be, I was shocked that it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on - and I had it for less than 24 hours.  Maybe I just had a faulty product, but I am definitely never getting another Iso product - I don&#x27;t want to deal with that again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY disappointed.</li>
    <li> great item for the price i paid on sale, as other mentioned, it works well but could been better if it gets little more hotter</li>
    <li> Thank God I was able to find this product!  My old broke from years of use and I absolutely love the way it works.  This one heats up really fast and does what it is supposed to do (per the description).  I have not had any of the problems that the other reviews seem to state.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have no experience in flat ironing my hair, but this made it so easy and there is no risk in burning your scalp.  The dials are located between the bars which I wish were on the outside, but all in all I love it and would recommend it</li>
    <li> The floating plates pinch and pull your hair at the end of the iron....not a good product, I sent it back...</li>
</ol>
