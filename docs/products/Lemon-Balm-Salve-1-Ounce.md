      <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>it is hands down the best product I have found for controlling both H1 &amp; H2 Herpes outbreaks.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the taste and smell of this stuff. I&#x27;m pretty sure the uses of this product are endless. A friend of min puts this in his hair for a shine and styling. This stuff is like magic. Put it on your lips or a cut/scrape. Buy some</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who gets cold sores when she is ill or stressed. You can actually see the difference after using it. Within 24 hours the cold sore is much smaller! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> After getting cold sores more and more often due to stress and menstrual cycles I decided to look for natural remedies to apply in order to ease the pain and increase healing. An article online listed a couple of natural balms to apply and I simply looked for lemon balm salve on Amazon and found this great little product. It really works! There&#x27;s no remedy to get rid of cold sores permanently but as soon as I feel my lips getting irritated I apply a small amount of this salve with a q-tip and after a day or two my lips are back to normal. The citrus aroma and non-greasy texture is very soothing. I highly recommend this salve for cold sore relief or any type of lip irritation.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband after seeing on Dr. Oz.  He likes it, but it is too soon see to know if it will prevent fever blisters.</li>
    <li> Nothing more than lemon smelling Vaseline. Not very thick ,very runny, doesn&#x27;t stay on the lips like I expected a lip salve to do.</li>
    <li> Great product. It seems to have helped to offer relief and really reduce the length of my son&#x27;s cold sore. Also, seems like it should last awhile.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing... It cleared up the worse case of acne I&#x27;ve ever experienced in one week... I cleansed my face with ACV and applied this and left it over night. It was amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my cracked heals. I have tried just about everything under the sun and this seems to be working very well so far.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product for shingles help.</li>
    <li> This is a great itch reliever. I have very sensitive skin and the slightest thing makes my skin irritated. I love how you can put a little of this product on your itch and immediately it is gone. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I saw on Dr. Oz show that lemon Balm was good for fever blisters.  So I ordered some.  I had a friend who used to make herbal salves that I used and this reminds me of the salve she made.  Glad I found this..now I won&#x27;t have to worry about being out of it anymore.  I have used this and it works like a miracle to lessen the healing time of the fever blister.</li>
    <li> I find this product works best on my cold sores if I start using it at the earliest onset of herpes symptoms. It tingles slightly, has a pleasant lemony scent, and it helps keep the breakouts from turning into blisters. I keep one jar at home and one at work.</li>
    <li> I have not had the opportunity to use it yet. I will try the balm when I get a mosquito bite</li>
    <li> If I could give it 10 stars, I would!  After reading all the reviews I purchased this, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It has changed my life.  If you struggle with this virus you will not be disappointed.  Cuts healing time in half.  Soothes.  Enables you to get through your day.  BUY IT!  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I have gotten cold sores for 40 years now. I no longer get the tingle. Instead, I get chapped lips the day before one or more start. Nothing kept that from happening except this product. I bought the 2oz size and divided it up into smaller sealed containers to take with me everywhere! Over the past month, I had 10 days where 3 cold sores came on - I used my usual remedy of abreva and neosporin (heals &#x27;em fast, once they fully present themselves) and they still came. It took a few days to heal....then the next 10 days I had several more threaten (the chapped lips came on at least 3 times!) and I used this balm and nothing - not even a blister or red bump. Super!! Between cold season and stress at work, I will rely on this from now on.</li>
    <li> Works amazing on cold sores.  As soon as I feel one coming on I start putting it on and it heals it in a day or two.  Also, the amount you get will last for a long long time.  Ive had the same one for over a year and I still have over half left and I share it.  Worth every single penny!</li>
    <li> Great product! It is the only thing that I found to work for cold sores. Great for chapped lips too!</li>
    <li> This is a very good balm for any little cuts and bruises and also for cold soars! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  you only need a teensy bit.  This small container would last me 5 years or more (as long as it doesn&#x27;t go rancid)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter, and it really works on cold sores!  As soon as she feels one starting on her lip, she applies the salve, and it goes away.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Glad I was able to find this on Amazon.  It&#x27;s in a tiny jar and small enough to drop inside my purse.  I am using it for hand cream, and I know there are many more uses as well.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this balm. It didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference one way or the other for a cold sore (a little disappointed). BUT, it is an all natural alternative to store bought balm. If it isn&#x27;t winter, do not leave this in a car or purse. I am happy I tried it. I am undecided if I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Use this to stop the pain of fever blisters and to make them go away faster, you wont be sorry you bought this !!</li>
    <li> I use this on my lips every night!  It glides on and is very moisturizing.  If you think you may be getting a cold sore, put this on your lips ASAP, your sore will never materialize.  Best product for prevention and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Use it for cuts and scrapes too. Love this</li>
    <li> Very cool and motivating tool.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I will order this exact product again.  I have been using it on my lips and skin over the past month or so.  I almost think it is making my lips dryer.  On the other hand, it seems to work well on dry areas, like elbows, and tissue rash area under the nose.  So kind of a mixed review.</li>
    <li> Bought to use on cold sores. Works great :) might be a small bottle but you only use a tiny bit, will last a long time!</li>
    <li> I really like this salve and think it is a better choice because it is not greasy and has a pleasant smell. It replaces preparation H well.</li>
    <li> I loved it very helpful for cold sores loved the taste and it was very soothing.  would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> This product is a God send. I suffer from HSV-2 and I was having multiple outbreaks on my left buttock. I saw a video on YouTube where a doctor mentioned Lemon Balm Extract to help in aiding with outbreaks. He stated that it cuts healing time in half. I started using the Lemon Balm Extract for my outbreaks and I must say they went away in 2 days. I wanted something else to add to my regimen &amp; came across the Lemon Balm Salve. I read countless reviews &amp; decided I would purchase 2 of them. They came fast also. I use the extract in my juice or water as well as on the skin as a topical ointment. I use a cotton ball &amp; soak it with the LBE and wipe the area several times. I add the LBS to help make the outbreaks go away faster. The LBS makes my skin so soft &amp; smooth. The area where it&#x27;s applied feels tingly &amp; I love the scent. Other than the small spots that is visible from the outbreaks, you cannot tell that I ever had anything there. My skin is smooth. Even though I haven&#x27;t had an outbreak for the last few days, I always use the LBE &amp; LBS on that area.  Anyone that has HSV-2 knows how horrible the blisters can be in regards to size and itching. After a few days they scab. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase. I read a lot of reviews about HSV-1 (Cold Sores) and how the LBS helped. I believe writing this review will help someone with HSV-2. I hope someone can find some piece of mind using this. I also use a herbalist who makes a special tea for me. It helps to remove the virus from the body. The tea is made with natural herbs only. When you begin to have multiple outbreaks, it&#x27;s called a Healing Crisis. If you are on any program like I am, continue to push through it. Don&#x27;t stop. It will be worth it. If you&#x27;re looking for a way to keep your outbreaks under control, Lemon Balm Salve along with the Extract will work wonders for you! (Know this was long but I want someone to know there&#x27;s hope).</li>
    <li> I put this on my lip irritation and it w for as gone in two days. Well hot damn! Great for my dry spots and I heard its great cold sores.</li>
    <li> Before using this I felt fine but wanted to try it. After using it though, I felt like I was always missing something</li>
    <li> I really like this product. A good holistic type of treatment for cold sore, etc..  I&#x27;m sure it has many other uses.  A tiny bit goes a long way.  It arrived quickly, and, is just as described.  Although the picture makes it look like a bigger jar than it really is when you get it. But, it is well worth the money, and, is an excellent sauve.  Will buy from this seller again in the future.</li>
    <li> I use this lip balm at the first signs of a cold sore coming on, and it literally stops the cold sore in its tracks.  I prefer to use this over the over-the-counter cold sore medications that also work well because this item is so much more natural.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with cold sores.  I got the idea from the Dr. Oz show.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me, so I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Upon delivery this item was running and very gritty.  I was not able to use it.  Wouldn&#x27;t order again.  A big waste of money.</li>
    <li> I received this item in a timely manner. Ordered for itching and it has helped with this.  I like using natural products such as herbs. This will be good for cold sores I have been told. I have had great success ordering from Amazon and will again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. I think there are other products out there that will keep your lips moist longer, but you pay a price for that in regards to alcohol and other chemicals in the chapstick. I like the properties of the lemonbalm and feel much more comfortable using this throughout the day during the dry season than the ol&#x27; chapstick or blistex.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff, I use it for cold sores and it works wonderful. Good price!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really had a cold sore to use it but it&#x27;s a pretty good amount and I can&#x27;t wait to try it</li>
    <li> I have been using this salve twice a day every day for almost a year and not one single outbreak. I did have 1 fever blister begin but I put this salve on it multiple times a day and the blister never came up - it was completely gone within 2 days. I will continue to buy and use this product as long as it is availble it is hands down the best product I have found for controlling both H1 &amp; H2 Herpes outbreaks. And the fact it is natural and not a lab created chemical based product makes it all the better. Go mother Nature!</li>
    <li> Works great for skin issues, is gentle and smells amazing! Used this for some dermatitis I had on my chin and also for fever blisters. Got rid of both in about 3 days.</li>
    <li> healed up a cold sore in just a few days, after fighting it with abreve and rx for over 2 weeks.  great product. very low melt temp so goes a LONGGGGG way. great fragrance and flavor as well.  very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm.  My whole family uses it.  It really saved our lips during our brutal winter this year!</li>
    <li> Received one day after order.  For use on my husband&#x27;s shingle virus.  Seemed to work well on easing his pain on his scalp.</li>
    <li> This stuff is liquid gold! I went from having a cold sore atleast twice a month to not having one AT ALL! If I feel tingling sensation or even if my lips get dry I just put this stuffon my lips and voila! No embembarrassment from cold sores at work and church anymore. I also take self heal herb extract. I strongly recommend them both!</li>
    <li> love it! works Perfect!</li>
    <li> Dr. Oz recommended, and yet, this didn&#x27;t work as I expected it to.  Was quite disappointed, since it was expensive for a balm, and the flavor seemed a little rancid.</li>
    <li> We just love the Lemon Balm Salve around our house. It works great on cold sores, shingles outbreaks, just about anything that comes your way. It has a wonderful smell, rubs in nice and smooth, and provides great relief to the skin.</li>
    <li> Really works, provides relief quickly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because Dr. Oz stated it was great for the control of cold sores. It has yet to work for that purpose. Nevertheless, I used it for my daughter&#x27;s chapped lips. I also has a pleasant lemon fragrance.</li>
    <li> Sending this product back!  Picture indicates its a cream and description states it contains two ingredients but when I received the product it&#x27;s actually a saulve and contains numerous ingredients to which I&#x27;m allergic to.  I ordered this product based on description.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned this is misleading in more then one way and needs to be corrected or this product needs to be pulled!!!</li>
    <li> Protects but didn&#x27;t heal.</li>
    <li> I use every night and it has really helped prevent cold sore outbreaks</li>
    <li> This product works great on Cold sores and I am happy with it, give it a try you&#x27;ll love it</li>
    <li> This is AWESOME for any blemishes or rashes!!!!</li>
    <li> Yes.  I have ordered before and this one arrived in better condition.  This stuff really soothes and works well.</li>
    <li> A very pleasant smelling salve to use on arthritis pain.</li>
    <li> Tried this for cold sores and it made no difference sadly. It smells wonderful, but as for healing or preventing cold sores, didn&#x27;t work for me. I will use it as lip gloss but this wasn&#x27;t a miracle &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; for me &amp; my sores.</li>
    <li> Herb salve  w/lemon balm! is what the label should read on the front. I was misled by the label shown to think it was lemon balm salve. They should display both sides of the label and show you what is really in it. Don&#x27;t buy this if Lemon balm salve is what your looking for.</li>
    <li> Lemon Balm needs to be 70% standardized to be effective for cold sores. This product is mainly beewax and oil...not effective. I would not recommend this item to anyone. I was very disappointed in it.</li>
    <li> my son uses this for cold sores  -  it works great.</li>
    <li> Several days after i received this I started getting a cold sore.  I started using this along with my l-lysine and acyclovir, my cold sore did not blister or swell up and was gone in 2 days.  I carry this in my lunch pail along with cotton swabs, just in case.  I even gave a small container to my mother so she can try it on her next one.</li>
    <li> Seems to be made with care.  It really soothes any rash or abrasion.  Safe for very sensitive areas I&#x27;ve found...if you know what I mean.  Wonderful product.  I plan to buy more to give to friends as gifts.</li>
    <li> Good product, very efficient, nice fragrance, good texture and you just need very little and it spreads everywhere. It looses 1 star cause, we wish it was a little less oily. We would buy again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Friday paid for 1 day shipping and got it Saturday because I was really in pain from my sores now its Monday and they are completely gone!! This product is amazing and works very well. I will be buying more in the future thank you Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I still have to use this, it rests in the refrigerater.  Lemon balm is the traditional herbal treatment for cold sores. I&#x27;ve used&lt;br /&gt;lemon balm before for this and it seemed to work for me</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works but the shipping service was very good thanks.</li>
    <li> Very soothing for my rash!  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Sent to my son for his cold sores..Dr Oz recommended this product...He uses this everyday to keep sores from breaking out</li>
    <li> seems to have a lot of lemon balm in it, not a lot of fillers.  Easy to apply.  Jar isn&#x27;t real big, so it won&#x27;t last very long if used often.  But this is first time I&#x27;ve seen lemon balm mixed in a jar like this without a lot a bees wax.  This is great for canker sores, or any sores for that matter.  Lemon balm is a great healer.</li>
    <li> Not too sure about the product....First, it is an oil. I thought there may have been an issue in shipping so I stirred it up and put it in the fridge; no difference. Almost as if there is not enough beeswax to make it more of a creamy texture and easier to apply. I have never used Lemon Balm before but the only thing I can relate it to is Citronella. That is all I can taste/smell when I wear it.  I&#x27;d like to know if both &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; stated above are normal and the way the product is suppose to be.....If so, I suppose I might have a little more faith in the product and try it again. Otherwise, it will end up being a waste of money :(</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product for face and body smell good too It has non greasy but cleans and moisturises.</li>
    <li> Pretty much ineffective!!! Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I had heard about using lemon balm for cold sores.  I bought this, a few days after I received it, I felt that horrible little tingle.  I started to applying it regularly and the cold never really developed.  Of course, it may not have been a big one to begin with.  I will definitely use again.  It does smell and kind of taste like furniture polish, but if that means no awful cold sores, big deal.</li>
    <li> This product seems to work well for preventing fever blisters.</li>
    <li> I bought this for relief of flareups of lip and hand eczema, but it didn&#x27;t help, actually it irritated it further.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful, especially on babies, it burned when I applied it to chapped lips.</li>
    <li> All I can say is amazing I love this stuff, it goes to work right away smells good feels good. wish I had known about it sooner.</li>
    <li> What can I say it works. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure and it didn&#x27;t happen overnight. The breakout on my buttocks went away. I bought two more jars, to keep my in my arsenal of meds.</li>
    <li> Very good for rashes and irritated skin. Only problem is I wish the jar were bigger. There should be an 8oz jar to last much longer.</li>
    <li> Miracle cream - my mother uses this for fever blisters and it works really well!</li>
    <li> Simply does not work DO NOT BUY unless you want to waste your money</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product!</li>
    <li> I was not overly impressed.  I was using it for a creme for a cut and I think it may work better for other applications.</li>
    <li> Great cold sore remedy!</li>
    <li> My grandchildren all have problems with chapped lips and this is the first thing that has really seemed to help them.</li>
    <li> Item is great for cold sores, cuts, dry cuticles.</li>
    <li> I just received this in the mail two hours ago. I had a power zit on the back of my neck (in the hair line), super red and inflamed. I rubbed it on and it is significantly smaller, and light pink now. This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> sorry but i used this product once only,and it got me worse a lot i do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> using it for rashes and it seems to help.  I recommend that a person at least tries it out to see if it works</li>
    <li> This balm is incredible. I would not have believed it unless I personally experienced it for myself. I am a natural born skeptic. It received so many great reviews that I had to try it for myself. All I can say is that with-in 24 hours my symptoms were almost completely relieved. With-in 48 hours my symptoms are \\&quot;Gone\\&quot;! I don&#x27;t know if it will work for everyone, but it certainly did for me.</li>
    <li> I can confirm that this actually does stop the small, underground bump from forming into an ugly blister. Amazing. I do not regret this at all.&lt;br /&gt;One thing to know is that its an oily medicine that will get messy if you have the jar on its side or upside-down because it will seep through the lid a bit, my solution, when i lost my first one and bought a new one, was keeping the white styrofoam seal on it by just folding it back halfway and putting back down before screwing the lid back on. Zero problems if you keep the seal partially on :))))</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who gets cold sores often.  His lip started healing by the next day after the first night he started using it.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily to avoid any cold soars from reoccurring. Not to mention it smells great just like lemons!</li>
    <li> Lives up to all the reviews posted...would definitely recommend it!  Have ordered several more as not to run out. IM</li>
    <li> My daughter has trouble with cold sores and we&#x27;ve tried everything, prescription &amp; over the counter. I read about this &amp; decided to give it a try. She felt a sore coming it was a tiny blister. She used it in the morning and afternoon and by evening there was nothing.! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells really good. It smells like lemon cake. It moisturizers your lips and great under lipstick. I keep it handy for winter dry spells,</li>
    <li> At FIRST SIGN of a coldsore, apply Lemon Balm Salve.  It heals the coldsore fast and keeps it from spreading.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of lip balm so my review may be skewed. It came on time and as stated. I did t think it last very long&lt;br /&gt; Felt very thin when put on lips.</li>
    <li> Okay...so first of all...this salve has a LOT of Lemon Balm. I have purchased &amp; used pure Melissa (Lemon Balm) essential oil and this balm is just as effective (and less expensive) PLUS it has a ton of other ingredients to, not only stay on your skin but also to add more of a punch to Melissa to help combat HSV (in the form of coldsores...or on other parts of your body). The makers of this balm really did their homework. Aside from the main ingredient, Lemon Balm, it also contains; olive oil, plantain leaf, echinacea, calendula flower, black walnut, slippery elm, licorice root, st Johns wort, beeswax (to keep it on your skin). This stuff is AMAZING. IT WORKS...use it when you first feel that tingling &amp; you will not have an outbreak. I love this stuff &amp; am ordering 5 more containers.... just in case it somwhow goes away...which I hope never happens!</li>
    <li> Soothing, calming and amazing cream.  Smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!  Will order again.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with irritated skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff works awesome for coldsores. If you are someone like me that gets them you feel awful about yourself. If you put some on before the cold sore comes through just when you start feeling that tingle then 9 times out of 10, it never came through. Also if I didn&#x27;t catch it. And it got really bad as long as I kept the balm on my lip it went away in two days. I remember  when I was really stressed at the hospital  and I didn&#x27;t have it with me. I had three coldsores on my button lip and two on top it was horrible. The doctor gave me some cream but it just made it worse. So I made my fiance run home and get it. Four days later  they were all gone and healed. Need to remind you I had 5 really big ones. I love this product .</li>
