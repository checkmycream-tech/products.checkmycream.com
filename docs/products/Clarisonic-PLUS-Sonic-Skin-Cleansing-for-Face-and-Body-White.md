      <li>It is easy to use and great for travel.  </li>
      <li>Saw amazing reviews all around</li>

      <li>&quot; The Clarisonic turned out to be a pleasure to use AND really effective.</li>
      <li>Everybody should own one of these.</li>
      <li>remarkable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled with this product.</li>
      <li>I use my own cleanser and afterwords use a face moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I have noticed that my pores have really reduced in size, which is Great!</li>
      <li>I ownly use this for my face.</li>
      <li>so I use my own cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I just use Rose water to remove the make up on my eyes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of those features I had to have when I was deciding what to buy, but in reality I guess it&#x27;s a nice to have for me.  </li>
      <li>To top it off, it has been making my skin softer, smoother, and all around better looking!</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this to anyone like me: with combination skin who just got off the pill and woke up one morning wondering where their beautiful skin went! :)</li>
      <li>This was recommended by my 40+ year old friend as the best product in it&#x27;s class.</li>
      <li>it are ok, but I rather use my own skincare products.</li>
      <li>Those bumps are gone and my skin feels so nice and smooth now!  </li>
      <li>Great product, worth the cost.  </li>
      <li>The best that Clarisonic will do is offer me a discount ($100) off a brand new one, making the price $125 plus tax, which I suppose is better than nothing.</li>
      <li>My skin is happy again and all is right in my world.</li>
      <li>It makes washing your face a breeze and easy!  </li>
      <li>This product has changed my life, and I feel much more confident in my own skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In this day and age, its very ecologically unfriendly to make this a disposable product.  </li>
      <li>I recommend to every woman that wants her face to be every day better and beautiful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so powerful and wonderful even at that setting that it takes a greater speed on the Clarisonic to even come close to the first setting on the Nutrasonic.</li>
      <li>I was able to return it without a problem.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this Clarisonic Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love love my Clarisonic Plus Skin Care System &amp; Spot Therapy Kit.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My skin used to be pretty darn bumpy in spots and this has buffed them all away!  I use it on my face every day and in the shower about three times a week all over my body.  Those bumps are gone and my skin feels so nice and smooth now!  It&#x27;s the best gift I&#x27;ve ever bought myself!!!</li>
    <li> Buyer beware!!! I will never buy another product from Clarisonic! I purchased this product and was pleased with it until it stopped charging last week; just over three years after purchase. The warranty is two years. I wished for Clarisonic to repair or replace the product (at a nominal charge if needed) given the fact that the battery no longer charged. I called Clarisonic and they were willing to give me a 25% off coupon to purchase another Clarisonic product from their website. The &amp;#34;updated&amp;#34; model to the Clarisonic PLUS on their website costs $260.00. In essence, milking another $195.00 from my wallet for a product that will last less than three years. I spoke to a supervisor at Clarisonic and she reiterated that the only option of resolution was the 25% coupon to be exchanged at their website for the purchase of new Clarisonic product. No other options. Only one (25% off coupon at their website)  is unacceptable to me given the price of the product and the fact that it only functioned for 3 years. Buyer beware!!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!  The other copy cats are not as good.  I use it every day.  I love it!  It is gentle on my skin and cleans well.  The product arrived on time and was well packaged.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this product to help with cleaning her face. After using it for a day or two she got my daughter in on it. They both love this product. They said it cleanses and makes their face feel soft. My wife has sensitive skin so she prefers the brushes made for sensitive skin. She said the normal brushes are a little rough for her. Over all if it makes both women in my life happy it must be good.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001884QDK Clarisonic Pro 3-Power Skin Care System, White]]Great product. Love it. Anything that helps to renew the skin is a plus in my books. Gentle technology.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to purchase this product based on the reviews. I have to say, I am  disappointed and am going to return it to the seller. I have not noticed any improvement in my skin.   It is no more clear or softer than before I began using this product more than 2 months ago. I really wanted to like it, but my hands do just as good a job as the Clarisonic, so why spend $200 on it?</li>
    <li> Like this product a lot. I have dry skin that flakes even though I use good cleansers and moisturizers. The Clarisonic has removed most do this flaking and my skin looks much better. I think the Clarisonic cleansers could be better so I use my own cleanser.  Make sure you read directions before use.  I gave it a 4 star rating because I really do think it&#x27;s overpriced, other than that I would have given it a 5 star.  This is a new machine for me so I hope the quality lasts over a period of time</li>
    <li> I would give it zero stars if that was an option.  Both the product and the company are horrid.  Save your money and use the Olay products. They will not only save you money, but will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not purchase my Clarisonic Plus through Amazon but directly from the company.  After it charged the first time and I used it until the charge was gone, it failed to recharge. I thought it was a problem with my outlet so I tried several others. I left it to charge for months and it never did take a recharge. I was disgusted and threw it in a drawer.  That was my mistake. I should have complained right away. To make a long story short, the company will not stand behind their product and issue any replacement or make a repair because I waited too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I inquired at Ulta one day, and the sales lady there said she had heard similar complaints. So, buyer beware.  Do not waste your money on this one!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it every night for my face and three times a week on my arms.  It&#x27;s great for exfoliating in the summer!      I took away one star b/c I bought this product to reduce the small bumps/pores on my face (near the nose) and it hasn&#x27;t done that.  I&#x27;ll def. continue to use it as it is great at exfoliating.</li>
    <li> One of the quickest ways to a glowing complexion is to slough off dry or patchy skin. I use my Clarisonic everyday and my skin is noticeably brighter. Even though I did buy more facial products from Clarisonic, I now use products that I buy from Target, etc...that work just fine and cost a whole lot less.&lt;br /&gt;Money well spent on the Clarisonic Plus, but save your money on the refills.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin and had past acne scars on my forehead. Until my mother bought me this for my birthday, don&#x27;t get me wrong I still have the occasional blemish here and there but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as it was before. Just a week after I began using this my husband and everyone around me noticed the glow my skin had. Two months in, my scars became nearly invisible.  I wash my face twice a day and use a mask every two three days. I love the way my skin looks and its all thanks to the clarisonic. You saved my life and skin</li>
    <li> I really did my homework before purchasing this one for my wife... Saw amazing reviews all around but the price was catchy and the best possible in Amazon... Using for about 2 months now and it changed her face... She loves it so I love it too....&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping too... Thank you...</li>
    <li> Love my Clarisonic but using the cleanser it came with broke my face out. Also using it twice a day did not make my skin happy. I now use it once a day, in the morning so it doesn&#x27;t get all nasty with my makeup with my Skinmedica cleanser and love it. Holds a charge forever. I leave it unplugged for days at a time.</li>
    <li> I love love my Clarisonic Plus Skin Care System &amp; Spot Therapy Kit. You get an instant glow the first time you use it. The set comes with the sensitive head brush and the body brush. The sensitive head brush works fine but for a more aggressive cleanse, I have ordered the normal head brushes also from Amazon. Another thing I like about the set is that it comes with 3 different cleansers travel sizes,and you can try to see which one works better with your skin type. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product and thanks to Amazon I was able to get it for a much better price than other places.</li>
    <li> Cleans skin better than just using soap and water. Has done wonders on my skin, which has been improving since my purchase of this item. I would  definitely recommend this to anyone with problemskin. Kit comes with a body brush and cleansers as well. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item through Amazon but, from a different dealer. I started having problems with the unit when using the body brush within a couple of months of purchase. It would lose it&#x27;s charge after about a minute, the body cycle is suppose to last 3 minutes. Finally, I just started using the facial brush exclusively, I get occasional cystic acne and the Clarisonic  was doing a great job clearing it up and stopping the outbreaks. Alas, the unit charge kept depleting over time, within 9 months of purchase, after letting it charge for a week it would die within seconds of me pushing the power button. I am one of those people that never fills out the warranty card, so, I figured I was totally hosed and was stuck with a $200.00 paper weight. However, I took the chance and called Clarisonic&#x27;s customer service, they asked me what the problem was, had me read the serial number off the unit, told me I had a two year warranty on the Plus model and shipped me the new one, asked me to mail the defective one back using the prepaid label. I received it within a week and a half. I live in Hawaii, so, that&#x27;s actually quite impressive. My skin is happy again and all is right in my world. Thank you Clarisonic Customer Support Team. You Rock!</li>
    <li> I love this product! My derpatoligest recommended it for me.my skin looks and feels great!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use,and the timer on it makes it easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this and their special brushes for oily skin and it didn&#x27;t slough anything off my oily, think facial skin.  I went back to cleaning with the white scrubby pads you can get at a drugstore.  I&#x27;m going to send this to my mom to see if she sees any benefits as her skin is much thinner and dryer than mine.</li>
    <li> I have purchased various face sponges, scrubs and brushes throughout my lifetime of beauty treating. I had watched several video reviews on this product.  I thought that their faces were beautiful enough because of their light skin tone.  It NEVER OCCURRED to me how I was layering makeup upon an unclean face even after I had just hand washed it!  After the first application my face was noticeably &#x27;brighter&#x27; bronze.  I am darker skin toned. It appeared to slough away the dull dead skin leaving a brighter look.  After the second washing and then a skin polish application there was another noticeable improvement. Another delicate problem is the creasing in the nose area and the brush does WONDERS!  I do use lip liner and the brush also helped clear out those pores just above the immediate lip area without agitation.   The third day in the shower and then to use the body brush on problem areas - sometimes the small creases in the toe nail area just doesn&#x27;t get clean enough for sandal season.  I am thoroughly in love and will faithfully continue to use my Clairsonic.  My face feels like it can actually breathe!</li>
    <li> I love it.  Immediate results.  My pores are getting smaller and my skin is smoother.  My husband also uses it and loves it as well.</li>
    <li> This is my first time writing a review. I usually dont bother, but i wanted to share my experience in the hope that it helps someone who is debating whether to buy this product. I actually received mine as a gift. my skin is a combination of oily and dry. its sensitive and scars easily. when i first started i broke out more, and faster. I believe this was because they may have already been built up under my skin from before hand and the clarisonic pulled them out. I had 1 small pimple weeks after the initial breakout.After about a month i could really tell the difference. my skin LOOKED cleaner. i have had maybe 1 or 2 tiny cyst like white heads which disappeared within a day (before i used to get alot..they also used to be big and painful). Other people have commented on my skin, saying it looks cleaner. Now, all i have are scars that are slowly starting to fade. I currently use cetaphil and alpha hydrox as a face wash, though i like ones that came with the clarisonic too.  Also, i recently got my left nostril pierced so i cannot use my clarisonic on that side, and there is a huge difference between both sides of my nose. my left side has more bumps, blackheads, and just looks a little more dirty.   i wont claim that this product will rid you of your acne because there are many factors involved with acne. However i can tell you that it will truly CLEAN your skin, and that makes a world of difference. i have already recommended this product to 3 of my friends. i know that if something ever happened to my clarisonic i would NOT hesitate to buy a new one. i have spent alot of money in the past trying to fix my skin and cover its flaws. For me, this product WORKS.</li>
    <li> I love how well my Clarisonic  cleans my face. My doughters have tried it and now they want one maybe for the Hoildays</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic for over four years now. My skin stays clear, no more breakouts unless I get lazy and skip a couple of days here and there. When I do skip a day or two I am always surprised at how smooth and soft my skin feels after using it again. It makes that much difference in the texture of my skin. Gives the perfect balance of gentle exfoliation. A true five star product!</li>
    <li> So expensive for so little results.  What a waste of money!  Buy a soft facial brush or an inexpensive rotating battery operated brush at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife, and she raved about it so much she talked me into trying it out.  I must say I really like it---I have never had my face feel so clean as it does after using this gadget to wash it.  We&#x27;ve only had it a short time, so I don&#x27;t know how well it will hold up, but so far I&#x27;d have to say it has exceeded our expectations.</li>
    <li> ACNE PRONE: I have been struggling with adult acne since my early twenties. Now I&#x27;m in my thirties, and I know my acne is triggered by hormones, stress, hair and makeup products, and exposure to gluten. Because these factors are difficult if not impossible to avoid completely, my acne is moderate, persistent, and challenging to treat. Last month, I took the plunge and ordered the Clarisonic Plus. While it hasn&#x27;t performed miracles, it has contributed to a noticeable reduction in my acne. It has also greatly improved the overall look and feel of my skin. It does an excellent job of prepping my skin for my blue light therapy device and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SENSITIVE SKIN: I never use the Clarisonic more than once a day and prefer to use it in the evening to ensure I have removed all of the day&#x27;s makeup, grime, and accumulated dead skin cells. My skin is sensitive and prone to inflammation which leads to breakouts, so I use the delicate brush head on the shortest interval setting. I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at judging when my skin has had enough. When that happens, I simply elect to give my face a rest from the Clarisonic that day. I typically use the device 4-6 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGROWN HAIRS: I tend to get ingrown hairs from shaving my legs. Now I use the Clarisonic body brush everyday in the shower to exfoliate. It works great, and my legs have never felt smoother!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORDS OF CAUTION: Be sure to dry off the brush head after each use--especially the facial brush. Don&#x27;t forget to wash the brush heads with antibacterial soap; otherwise, you could end up spreading bacteria all over your face.</li>
    <li> This product has changed my life!!  A girlfriend of mine has one and brought it along with her to a girls weekend away.  I saw her using it and was like \\&quot;WHAT IS THAT?!?\\&quot;  She let me use it and I decided then and there I HAD to have one!!  It makes washing your face a breeze and easy!  I actually look forward to washing my face now and my skin has never been better!      The body brush that this kit comes with is awesome too!  GREAT of those dry skin areas (elbows, knees and heels).      This product really does make taking care of your skin a thoughtless process, fun, and enjoyable!!  You can use any cleanser with it too! Not to say that their cleansers are not great, because they are, but if you are worried about switching cleansers then use your current stuff for a bit and then switch...this product is SO easy and SO worth the price!!</li>
    <li> Yes, I&#x27;m a little crazy in that I own both but I got a great deal on each one. I&#x27;m able to write this review having used both and figured that would be helpful for all prospective buyers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the Nutrasonic- hands down winner! I missed it when I switched and just used the Clarisonic. It will spray a little water when you first put it on your face but that&#x27;s ok - you will learn easily how to work around that and keep it from happening. But, it is totally worth that bit of spray. It works so well and I look forward to washing with it every day. No more flaky dry skin that my makeup just made worse. No more embarrassment about walking around with those dead skin cells covered up with foundation - ick. I actually look forward to putting on foundation now because my skin is so smooth and wonderful now. Has a great glow and looks more youthful. (Hate to talk about this but, the blackheads do not occur as much and those that are there just want to come right out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clarisonic is much less powerful and when you compare the two brush heads the Nutrasonic has many more bristles. I&#x27;ve owned the Nutrasonic for a few months and I&#x27;m still using the sensitive skin brush on the lowest speed setting. It&#x27;s so powerful and wonderful even at that setting that it takes a greater speed on the Clarisonic to even come close to the first setting on the Nutrasonic. That power just gets my face much more clean than the Clarisonic ever does. I read somewhere that the brush on the Clarisonic was made in a special way so that it doesn&#x27;t give that initial spray of water as I mentioned before. But, I say, who cares? It doesn&#x27;t come close to cleaning my face the way the Nutrasonic does! I actually put the Clarisonic away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a very gentle sonic brush then this might be good for you. If you want a stronger exfoliation checkout Nutrasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been thinking of getting in touch with Nutrasonic to let them know how great it is and that theyshould get their product out there more - just can&#x27;t stand how Clarisonic is in the stores and it&#x27;s not as nearly as good as this product is. That&#x27;s how much I think it&#x27;s a worthy purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought smaller Nutrasonics for travel because I can&#x27;t live without it. It&#x27;s much cheaper than the Clarisonic and worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still giving the Clarisonic three stars because it is well made and the timer is a nice feature (although it can be annoying since I don&#x27;t see a way to do the cleansing without having the timer on - sometimes I don&#x27;t want it on at all). Another nice feature is that it knows what brush head you put on so it uses the proper speed - like for the body brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/2/12 - Wanted to add a few things about the Nutrasonic- it is wonderful for ingrown hairs on your legs! If you are a curly-haired gal like I am you will find this a great thing! I try to use the body brush a few times a week and have noticed that the little bumps are so much better (virtually gone!) and the exfoliation is preventing a lot of them from occurring in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the Nutrasonic gives you a warning that it is going to need charging soon by indicating this a few uses before it runs out. This is very helpful. The Clarisonic seems to simply die when it needs charging and that is frustrating.</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic Plus Skin brush is fantastic. I did a fair amount of research on skin brushes in general. I try to read as many reviews from as many different sources as possible also.&lt;br /&gt;The Plus unit charges quickly and holds the charge for several days, well over a week. I use the brush in the shower, at least once a day, and also wash my face in the sink.  Afterward, I  wipe it off with a towel and return to its cradle.&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic has a &amp;#34;family &amp;#34; of brushes, but the size of the PLUS unit is perfect for at home and travel in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;The brush, which I had expected to replace within a month, is very well designed.  I used it for six weeks before replacing it, but I could have waited. I use a very small amount of cleansing gel-much less than I used when I washed my face with my hands or a wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;While each of the above are terrific selling points, the only thing that mattered to me was a noticeable improvement in the cleanliness and clarity of my skin, and mine has never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend the Clarisonic PLUS unit.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product 10 stars I would.  I have had issues with my skin my whole life and this is the first product that has thoroughly left my skin clean and blemish free.  Definitely well worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Unbeatable price. Unbeatable product. Everybody should own one of these. It&#x27;s a great investment. You get more than your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> A great quality machine.  I actually have two of them.  One at my sink and the other in the shower.</li>
    <li> I was worried that that the brush would be too harsh for my face but in reality the brush leaves my skin really soft. My products applied after cleaning my face just get absorbed so quickly it&#x27;s just wonderful. I highly recommend this product to anyone thinking about making this purchase.</li>
    <li> Let me first start by saying that I am a 28 YO male that purchased this product not through Amazon but through the Clarisonic website with free engraving but costing $235.  The product itself is very well built, a bit heavy(ish) and bulky with the charger.  As for cleaning your skin it works very well and I have noticed an increase in the brightness and clarity of my skin and I use this about 2x a week for a week now, so a total of 2 times so far.  I think I will continue to use it 2x a week as that seems to be perfect for my skin type (combination).  It clears out the pores, which is good for me since I have quite a few blackheads with very few whiteheads.  Anyway, so I have only used this 2 times so far and I have noticed a definite reduction in pore size and blackhead amount which is amazing.  I also am using higher quality products, mainly Jack Black and Anthony, and that seems to be working too.  The Clarisonic seems like it would be good for makeup removal and is definitely good for clearing of your skin, my only complaint is the size of the unit and its charging base.  It is very large in comparison to other gadgets that make up my bathroom routines.  It does come with a few products that I have yet to try as you can use it with your normal products.  The one I bought straight from Clarisonic came with a travel bag, Face Brush, Body Brush, 6oz Restore Body Serum, 2oz Refining Skin Polish, 1oz Refreshing Gel Cleanser, 1oz Nourishing Care Cleaner, and 1oz Gentle Hydro Cleanser.  It also came with instruction manual and $25 off future Clarisonic.com purchase.  Overall I am happy with this purchase and would recommend the product to others.</li>
    <li> Had one for just over a year.  Needs better support.  Should last longer for the price.  Can you purchase a replacement battery or charger.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Amazon after talking with an aesthetician about the benefits of deep cleaning my skin.  I charged it according to the directions for 24 hours before using.  I used it once, and then moved the base to a better location.  It would not charge at all, even after moving it back to the original outlet.  I had registered the product with Clarisonic and so I called them.  They did not hesitate to replace the unit.  They did not even ask where I purchased it, just told me to expect my replacement, and to use that box with the prepaid postage.  I had read some Amazon reviews about poor customer service from Clarisonic, but that was definetly not my experience.    I have had the Clarisonic Plus for a few weeks, and I am very impressed.  It is easy to use, fast, and seems to do a great job of cleansing.  I had CO2 Laser resurfacing and I started using it after my skin had healed enough to be washed.  Very gentle, and did not irritate my new, sensitive skin.  I am not sure I would order the Plus again, as I am not entirely sold on the body brush or spot therapy.  Not sure of the benefit there.  Otherwise, I would highly recommend the Clarisonic Skin Care System.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush a little over a month ago and I wish I would&#x27;ve bought it years ago! I am almost 28 years old and have had acne forever it seems. Clarisonic is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used for my skin care (I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv and have been on a few different medications including Accutane)  Now that I have clarisonic my acne has been under control and even my acne scars have started to fade.  My face has never felt cleaner.  I highly recommend this product!  Do yourself a favor and order it today!</li>
    <li> Item was delivered on time. Excellent cleansing tool. Need to keep both brush heads clean all the time. Especially the brush head for face, otherwise you just spread more bacteria on your face. I wash it every time with antibacterial hand shop after use it. I&#x27;m glad I bought the PLUS version as I had stretch marks on my body, and my stretch marks cream works even better after I use this tool.</li>
    <li> I have never used this product since it was a gift to my wife. I&#x27;ve seen her use it frequently and praise its benefits everytime. As a matter of fact, it does smooths her skin with a good exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She uses it in the shower and it seems to be quite durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose she would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have 2 daughters and a wife.  The two daughter have had one of these and wanted to get one for their mother. They think this product is the best and now their momma thinks so.</li>
    <li> Had two. Both died within a year. It wasn&#x27;t that great for cleansing and a year later I developed rosacea. Not sure if it&#x27;s related, but I suspect this device is not great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The concept of the Clarisonic Plus is great. The cleansing works really well and you can instantly feel a difference. The reason why I am giving it one star is that after having had this product for a year now, the batteries have weakened so much, all I can do is use it one time, and then it has to go back to the charger for 4 hours. The battery does not even last long enough to do both face and body.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed this happening about 6 months after I bought it, and I only use it 1-2 times per week max. Very disappointed in the battery life.</li>
    <li> The price is too high for how it looks like and for the quality. The idea and marketing makes it expensive. Otherwise the product is a good design.</li>
    <li> I actually bought mine through Macy&#x27;s. I wanted one for awhile, but the price held me back. I finally bought it for myself as a Christmas present and I am so glad I did! I&#x27;ve battled blemishes for years and using this has helped them to clear up much faster than just regular face washing and my face feels cleaner after using this to remove makeup. To top it off, it has been making my skin softer, smoother, and all around better looking! I wish I had not waited so long!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hype. Maybe if I was heavy into make-up I&#x27;d see the benefit, but I&#x27;m not and I really don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin, and the brush head after use isn&#x27;t grimey.</li>
    <li> Great product, worth the cost.  I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable change in my skin with smaller pores and improved tone.  I have used Clarisonic for one month with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint soap.  I am very happy with Clarisonic and regularly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I was delighted at how quickly the item arrived, but was disappointed to find that it was not the one I ordered. I ordered the Clarisonic PLUS, but received the Clarisonic Classic instead. When I wrote to the vendor, they promptly replied reporting that the listing was made in error and that they did not actually have the Clarisonic PLUS. I was able to return it without a problem. I am hoping that Amazon figures out how to correct this error, as I believe this same thing happened to another customer, based on my reading of the reviews for this item.</li>
    <li> Got the product on time and tried the product and after one week of using people started asking me about my skin what have I done to it, Very good product my skin is better and soft and at least for me it the wrinkles faded away. Always use the time that they recommended otherwise you can damage your skin.</li>
    <li> I rec&#x27;d the Clarisonic Plus a couple of weeks ago. I started using once a day, now I use 2x a day. I can really tell the difference in how clean my face feels after using the Clarisonic. Your face feels like it is really, really clean. I purchased the Body brush, not knowing that it was already included in the kit itself. So now I have the replacement whenever I need it. I also just rec&#x27;d the Deep Pore cleanser that I ordered and I cant wait to use that brush head. I dont use the sensitive one that the kit came with, because it feels too soft; my son uses that brush head instead. He also likes the way his face feels after using the Clarisonic. I hesitated to buy it, only because of the price. After reading great reviews, I decided to order it and try it out for myself. I&#x27;m glad I did! I use my own cleanser and afterwords use a face moisturizer. You can just feel your skin absorb the moisturizer. I have noticed that my pores have really reduced in size, which is Great! This Clarisonic Plus was the best purchase I could have made when it comes to taking care of my skin. It is high priced, but I think it is worth it!!</li>
    <li> Very good product for a good price .  Wife and I love this. We use this weekly in the shower , with great results</li>
    <li> this product was wonderful for about ten days.  I loved it.  BUT then it stopped working.  It would hum but would only run for half a second.  I returned it without AND my money was refunded.  If anyone else has had this same problem please let the company know.</li>
    <li> 1.  Cheap packaging&lt;br /&gt;2.  Smudges on stand and on &amp;#34;Clarisonic&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Text on box assures me that it is safe to use in shower or &amp;#34;balh&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a fake and sent it back without using it.  I will purchase my Clarisonic from an authorized dealer.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Clarisonic Plus through the Clarisonic website. My warranty expired 7/2013, about 5 months ago now. Naturally, my Clarisonic stopped working right after the warranty expired. It worked fine up until then, but I think it is a product designed to last not much longer than the warranty period (perhaps most things are these days). I was told by their warranty experts that they are expected to last about 3 to 5 years. The best that Clarisonic will do is offer me a discount ($100) off a brand new one, making the price $125 plus tax, which I suppose is better than nothing. I&#x27;m just disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last longer. Be cautious.</li>
    <li> I recommend the product.  I&#x27;ve seen some results, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used it long enough to see even more results.</li>
    <li> I got this for my teen daughter who has acne prone skin. At first she felt no difference, but after resuming her previous cleaning routine she complained her face just didn&#x27;t feel clean. She used this with Clarisonic Refreshing Gel Cleanser and has used for a week now and has noticed a difference in not only how her face feels, but how it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The feel of the brush on the face takes getting used to. It takes practice to not get it to splatter all over the place. The brush head for faces is a bit bigger than those found on similar products in stores so it takes a bit of getting used too and probably not ideal for young children. However my young teen daughter adapted well after a few days of using the Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It leaves face feeling cleaner than with traditional cleaning methods. The handle is easy to hold and the brushes go on and off with ease so changing brush heads is easy. The brush heads come with a vented cover so you can store them after use and not worry about mildew. The brush itself is water resistant and so can be used in the shower.  The charging cradle is easy to use and has a vent at the bottom for any water to drain out so you can put the brush on the charger after use and not have to worry about drying it.</li>
    <li> You will see the difference in less that a week of use! I really like this product, and I am very pleased with my results.  I am glad I got it when I did summer is on the way, and my skin is going to glow!  My skin is smoother, softer, brighter, and any acne scaring that I had are fading away.</li>
    <li> I purchased this same product from Ebay (sorry Amazon!) and I LOVE it! I use it every week and cannot say enough good things about this kit.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it.  My face feels and looks so clean week after week.  I even use other face cleaners instead of the ones provided and still get a good result.  You get what you pay for! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 21 years old and have always had an issue with my skin, specifically acne. It was never terrible, probably pretty minor actually, but it was something I was self-conscious about, and I could never see it completely go away. I heard really good things about the Clarisonic, and I thought that it couldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try. I chose the PLUS because of the body brush, since I have small issues with the skin on my arms as well. After the first couple days of using the Clarisonic on my face and body, I could already see a noticeable difference! I was using Proactiv as well, so that might have played a small role, but now I have less acne on my face and my skin is much smoother. I also have a little bit of acne scarring which I also saw to clear up a little. The brushes they sent with it weren&#x27;t too abrasive at all, even on the highest setting. It doesn&#x27;t weigh much at all, and it&#x27;s completely sealed from water, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about damaging it. Whenever I charge it, I usually do so overnight, so I&#x27;d estimate the battery is around a week. Overall, I love this product and completely understand what all the hype is about. I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always washed my face twice daily and thought I was doing well at keeping my face clean.  I&#x27;ve always had problems with acne and washing my face is essential.  I have to add that I&#x27;m horrible for sticking with anything for more than two weeks and when it comes to beauty products, I continue to shop around even if I&#x27;m totally satisfied.  With that said, I&#x27;ve been using this Clarisonic every day for four years now! I couldn&#x27;t do without this device and my younger teenage years would have likely been less acne plagued if I&#x27;d had this.  I absolutely love it and I never realized how much cleaner my face could be.</li>
    <li> after a few months my clarisonic is intermittently working, aver giving them the serial number they said it is not one of their products!mI got burnt</li>
    <li> I have 2 of this device one  of them does not work since i purchase it !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my PLUS for about 18 months now and it&#x27;s amazing at keeping my skin looking fresh and clear.  I have combination skin with lots of dry patches, black heads on my nose, and a few small wrinkles.  I use the PLUS 2-3 times per week and, after an initial break-in period, it has managed to clear up all my blackheads (making my pores appear smaller), eliminate breakouts, and minimize wrinkles around my eyes.  Dare I say that I look and feel younger? Well I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, my PLUS stopped working around 16 months after I bought it. However, they have a 2 year manufacturer&#x27;s warranty.  All it took was one easy call to their customer support line.  Now they are sending me a brand new PLUS  and it will have a new 2 year warranty.  That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s guaranteed for ANOTHER two years.  My replacement can&#x27;t come soon enough, my skin has gone back to its old ways.  Luckily, it should be here in about 1 week.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my 40+ year old friend as the best product in it&#x27;s class. I absolutely love it. My skin felt better after the first use and looked better within a week. It&#x27;s a perfect \\&quot;gift to self\\&quot; or for someone who will take 2 minutes a few times a week for lovely skin.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 4 months. Would charge all night and the next morning it would work maybe a full minute then turn all the way off. Nothing! Now it doesn&#x27;t even charge. When you put it on the charger it makes a clicking sound.</li>
    <li> I ordered my Plus from Clarisonic.com and paid extra for the Cherry Blossom print.  The photos online showed smaller flowers on a matte finish.  What I received had large flowers on a glossy finish.  Also, the print was slightly messed up.  I will post the photos on Amazon so you can see what I mean.  I spent $297.70 total for the Plus and two additional brushes.  I am slightly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Contacted Clarisonic and was able to exchange the items.  I like the Teal one better.  It is a solid color but the finish does not look as cheap as the previous one.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Great deal on Amazon with bonus products as well. I have noticed results within the first week of use...would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> My previous review was premature. I went ahead and contacted Clarisonic directly even though it was just over a year since I purchased. Although the product&#x27;s reliability was less than expected, the excellent customer service completely made up for the inconvenience of the product failing.</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with my new Clarisonic Brush. Money well spent! I already had a Sonicare Toothbrush (same maker) and I figured \\&quot;well, if I can spend a hundred dollars on something that just cleans my teeth really well, why wouldn&#x27;t I spend $200 on something that can do that to pretty much the entire surface of my skin?\\&quot; The Clarisonic turned out to be a pleasure to use AND really effective. I love the skin polish it comes with, although it works well with some other products. I think low lather for body is best, while high lather works pretty well on the face. It makes skin extra clean, taking off all of the dead skin cells and old products, like lotions, some of which tend to accumulate if not directly scrubbed off. Skin feels smooth and even and the brushes are not abrasive or painful at all, although I think I will eventually end up replacing my facial brush head with an extra sensitive one, because I just don&#x27;t need that much exfoliation on daily basis, especially on my cheeks. My biggest criticism of the Clarisonic brush is that it should come with some sort of a water safe holder, in addition to the charger, which is not water safe, so that a person bathing or showering can easily set it down in a secure way. As things stand, I just have to set it down on the edge of the tub, or have bob in the water and keep my fingers crossed that it doesn&#x27;t fall off or bang against something as I try to get soap off my face. It is really curved off all sides, so there isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;safe\\&quot; way to put it down. However, this is a 100% no regrets addition to my daily bathroom routine and I would recommend it for anyone who has skin.</li>
    <li> I started using the Clarisonic a year ago and could not be more pleased!!  I bought one for my daughter in law as a Christmas gift because I was so pleased.  I then learned it was recommended by Dr Oz as a great \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; product for the skin!  Yeah!</li>
    <li> My face feel so smooth, clean and fairer the first time I use it. I noticed the cotton wool does not have residual of the facial cleanser when I use Clarisonic for face.</li>
    <li> Anyone who is interested in a Clarisonic PLEASE do not buy from amazon! All of the sellers are selling fake products! Yes it says Clarisonic in the description and on the packaging, yes it looks the same - but it is NOT the same!&lt;br /&gt;The serial number on the bottom of the device is made up, the reason I know this is because I called customer service after an issue with verifying my product&#x27;s authenticity through their site - only to find out that the serial number is completely made up and is not in their system!&lt;br /&gt;The customer service representative went on to tell me they do not even SELL Clarisonic&#x27;s on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have absolutely no clue how these companies are getting away with selling fraudulent merchandise, but if you read the reviews on the any other clarisonic product on Amazon they&#x27;ve experienced the same thing I have experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully Amazon gave me a full refund with no hassle, and I am also thankful I found out before it was too late. Save yourself the trouble and buy an authentic Clarisonic from the official website! It is the same price as amazon and you are assured that you are getting a genuine product.</li>
    <li> We are 3 months outside of the warranty period and the unit is not holding a charge anymore like it used to.  Really makes no sense that an item this costly does not have a serviceable battery.</li>
    <li> I bought this from another website too (sorry amazon), but if you search you will find it cheaper and sometimes 20%off + free shipping. I&#x27;ve had it almost a year. I don&#x27;t have acne, just sensitive skin that gets flaky. I have Asian combination skin. NOTHING seemed to help. I tried every skin care wash/product out there it seemed. From Kinerase, Kiehls, Clinique, Bare Minerals, philosophy, exfoliators, etc. Nothing seemed to help. When I exfoliated it was always too rough and then I&#x27;d get these red irritated patches on my face. And the gentle cleaners didn&#x27;t seem to do enough. I read all the reviews about Clarisonic and decided to give it a try. I have the sensitive skin brush head, use it once a day and no more flaky patches of skin on my cheeks and chin anymore. My skin is smooth, and feels and looks cleaner. Even my husband noticed.  I used the Clarisonic cleansers initially but then decided to just use it with the regular Cetaphil cleanser from the drugstore (since it&#x27;s similar in consistancy). My skin has improved greatly in appearance. I have gone from trying every expensive cleanser to just simplifying my routine to Dove soap to wash my face day and/or night, and Cetaphil cleanser with the Clarisonic once a day in the shower. I put a pea size amount of Cetaphil lotion on my face (mixed w/ a dab of water) and I&#x27;m done. I have gone from having to use a liquid foundation to a lighter powder.  It&#x27;s pricey, but you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> After researching clarisonic and reading a ton of reviews I finally decided to bite the bullet and buy the clarisonic plus. I have bad acne and the first couple weeks I really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, but I did notice my skin felt cleaner. Well I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months now and I have to say I am overwhelmingly happy with the results. My skin has cleared up significantly and my face has never felt this smooth and clean before. I took it home over Christmas break and my sister got hooked as well. She is planning on buying one soon. You can&#x27;t expect overnight results with clarisonic, but over time it DEFINITELY makes a difference...at least it did for me. I would recommend it without reservations to any of my friends!</li>
    <li> I really love my Clarisonic and I&#x27;ve only had it for a few short days. The texture of my skin is 100% different. I have gone to the dermatologist for cystic acne for a while and have a prescription for pracasion (sp?) cream and that has helped a lot with my red, cystic acne, but I still have scarring and white acne (black heads and white heads) and large pores. I think the Clarisonic really helps prepare my skin for my cream and a moisturizer. Get this, its worth the money you will save trying to find the perfect cleansing system. Also-this one comes with samples of their face washes. I like the refreshing gel cleanser, it smells really good too! There is a coupon for $25 off any Clarisonic product when you register your brush, I can&#x27;t wait to take advantage of that!</li>
    <li> I am a 16 year old male with highly sensitive, acne prone skin. I purchased this amazing item just about a week ago, due to the price I was expecting something incredible that would provide immediate results. This item lived up to every single expectation that I had set for it! The device itself is solid and sturdy, but not too heavy at all. Since the first time I washed my face with this brush, my skin has been tighter, more radiant, and my acne is diminishing at an astounding rate. The trial size cleansers are great as well, each one of them works for all skin types. I highly recommend this product for any teenager, or adult with frequent breakouts. This product has changed my life, and I feel much more confident in my own skin. Do not let the price deter you from an incredible item!</li>
    <li> Once again Amazon marketplace and Amazon recommended sellers champion disreputable manufacturers! I am a long time regular customer of Amazon marketplace, for all things great and small. Because Amazon ALWAYS backs up their merchandise. They back it up with the most outstanding customer service in the world, literally. I get a sensible, helpful, intelligent, understanding, competent, efficient, and articulate customer service technician INSTANTLY on the telephone when I call for Help. They easily resolve any issue I may have with a procedure, product, seller, or even a manufacturer. This is just one of those many occasions that I am so grateful I purchased through Amazon instead of the actual manufacturer. I take very excellent care of my skin, and I use only the very best products. My results show this. Anyways, I was looking at Clarisonic PLUS Sonic Skin Cleansing for over a year. My hesitation was that so many customer reviews (and even a couple of professional aesthetician friends) complained of defective merchandise right out of the box and no recourse with the manufacturer. I thought because I tended to be lucky with satisfactory purchases (due greatly to the availability of voluminous customer reviews), that I would fare successfully with finally purchasing this product, and I risked it. The bother was the risk, more than the money for me. I KNEW for sure that if I purchased from Amazon, and in this case their top recommended seller of this product, that I was safe no matter what. Well, I received the item at a reasonable price and expeditiously. I precisely followed all of the instructions for first use, including registration. The unit stopped working six minutes into its first cleansing application, after a full 24-hour charge. I charged it again, it required another 24-hours before it was fully charged. Again, the unit stopped working a few minutes into its cleansing application. I charged it once more, it required another 24-hours before it was fully charged, and once more the unit stopped working a few minutes into its cleansing application. I am very careful and technically apt, so it was a defective unit. I immediately called the manufacturer, because I figured it wasn&#x27;t the seller&#x27;s fault. The Clarisonic company acknowledged my registration, but because I didn&#x27;t buy the item from their website they refused to honor my polite request for an EXCHANGE. Also the customer service rep was smarmy and smirky and couldn&#x27;t have cared less about my customer satisfaction nor my predicament. I realized that they are very crass because they obviously get SO MANY of these calls from dissatisfied purchasers of these defective items. I even put in a voice mail to their supervisory level and got no return call. Truly, Clarisonic couldn&#x27;t have cared less. I also realized that Clairsonic \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; was in actuality a generic call center and not even the corporation, which explains some of the poor unprofessional response I got from them. BUYER BEWARE! You don&#x27;t want to be at their mercy! I immediately called Amazon, and as usual, Amazon&#x27;s CUSTOMER SERVICE said that they would back up my purchase 100%, no matter what. They asked me to follow protocol with the Amazon recommended seller, and let them know that the product was defective. I did, and they were STELLAR! They didn&#x27;t even ask a question, they simply said send it back. And they IMMEDIATELY shipped me out a replacement THAT DAY before they even officially received my return item! I&#x27;m SO GLAD that I always check with Amazon first before making major or minor purchases. The replacement item seems to work OK for now. I&#x27;ve only used it twice, I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
    <li> Here is the scoop:&lt;br /&gt;I had near perfect skin for as long as I can remember. I didn&#x27;t have a cleansing system, I was just lucky I thought and I always received compliments on what great skin I had. When I got off birth control after 15 years on it, I immediately noticed I was getting frequent pimples and in some cases, the dreaded breakouts! Being in my early thirties, this was not good. I felt I needed to look crisp on the job and let&#x27;s face it, I wanted to feel confident and not worry about a zit or breakout on my forehead while meeting with a client.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the plunge: I read so many reviews - both good and bad and decided, what the heck, it is worth $200 if there is a chance I can get my near perfect skin and confidence back. For me, the Clairsonic works fabulously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History of my skin: Now, I have combination skin - a little dry and a little oily. It is fair to say I have sensitive skin as well. For the first three weeks, I used the Clairsonic religiously and noticed after a week, I am looking good! Lately, I noticed when I use the Clairsonic twice a day, sometimes my cheeks get red and my skin feels irritated so ladies &amp; gents- you will have to decide how frequently to use this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preferred face wash is Cetaphil - so I put a dime size amount on my face and let the Clairsonic do the rest. Like I said, I was going 2x a day for the first three weeks and and now doing just the mornings in the shower.  I use very light makeup: a little power to get rid of my \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; spots and blush, that&#x27;s it. If I used more makeup, I would most likely use it at night to ensure all the makeup is washed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I rate this product 5 Stars. I have clearer skin and have my face I remember back. My skin is much smoother and gives me more confidence during the day. I see the blackheads on my nose are mostly gone and I think it is fair to say while this product does not eliminate pimples all together, it minimizes them to a verysmall, manageable one that goes away in a day with some salicylic acid (I prefer Clinique&#x27;s - small bottle lasts me almost a year!) and Neutrogena makes a great touch up stick that matches your face powder and has salicylic acid in it so it actual covers up the pimple and helps clear your skin without it being noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to anyone like me: with combination skin who just got off the pill and woke up one morning wondering where their beautiful skin went! :)</li>
    <li> I purchased the Clarisonic Plus from Sephora and was very excited to use it.  It cleans, but overpriced for a cleaning brush.  A small baby wash cloth works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I can&#x27;t believe is that the battery is not replaceable.  It stopped working just under a year after I purchased it.  I didn&#x27;t know it had a 2 year warranty so I didn&#x27;t contact them right away.  I just called and found out that the battery is not replaceable....WHA?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this day and age, its very ecologically unfriendly to make this a disposable product.  They offered me a new one for $170....why on earth should I throw out another $170 so that if it dies on me after 2 years, because ALL rechargeable batteries will need to be replaced at SOME point! I&#x27;ll just have to throw it away again and repurchase?  Clarisonic, its time to go back to the drawing board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insult to injury is the fact that mine didn&#x27;t even make it to the one year mark before it quit working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll look into a skin sonic or similar, they&#x27;re good enough, these brushes aren&#x27;t magical, if I saw a difference in my skin, I&#x27;d pay ......</li>
    <li> My face feels so much cleaner after using the Clarisonic, there is a noticeable difference. Easy to charge, clean and use.</li>
    <li> I use the product at least once a day to cleanse and every other day to polish.  My skin appears to be brighter and not as dry</li>
    <li> Very high quality item.  Works very well.  The manual is a little tough to understand, so changing timer settings can take a little getting used to, but its worth it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!!! I use it every night and it is such an easy and great way to wash my face. I would recommend this to anyone. I love the body brush and other brushes for different skin types. It is easy to clean the brush with some soap. The only thing I would say is if you are someone who plans to bring a clarisonic on trips, I would buy the MIA as well because it is easier to carry around and the charger is easier to transport. The charger for this device is bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with the clarisonic!!</li>
    <li> I read lots of reviews on this product before purchasing and was a little nervous that it would be defective.  I&#x27;ve had it a month now with no problems.  I even dropped it on the tile shower floor and it remained in one piece with no issues.  My skin feels much cleaner with this and I&#x27;m using less product.  I just use my regular cleanser instead of the cleanser that came with it.  The body brush is great for knees and elbows.  Overall very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I must say this thing is marvelous! It is true that this will not miraclously airbrush you to perfection, this will simply clean your skin better and will allow your pores to breathe the way they should, hence, making it glow glow glow. I am acne prone, sensitive, and as a differin user (a skin thinner acne topical), I can vouch this to be as gentle as I need it to be, and effective as I demand it to be. I started using it once every other day to test it out, but now I use it twice a day and all good! I do need to say that I don&#x27;t use there cleansers since I know for a fact Korres is the only thing I love and won&#x27;t irritate me. So, the products itself I just can&#x27;t rave about. Haven&#x27;t regretted the purchase at all, andI don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to hands, soap and water. Great buy!</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S JUST LIKE ANY OTHER BRUSH AND MORE EXPENSIVE $$$$$. I BOUGHT THIS Clarisonic PLUS Sonic Skin Cleansing for Face and Body - White THINKING THAT IT WAS GONNA BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT, BUT IT&#x27;S JUST ANOTHER BRUSH EXFOLIATOR, NOTHING SPECIAL. IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS, NOTHING ELSE, NOTHING MORE, YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT THIS AND SAVE MORE MONEY.</li>
    <li> I have one of these and love it.  I sent this one to my Son-in-law, as a gift and he said it&#x27;s great. Clarisonic has such good products.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed. This product had lot of good reviews. It didn&#x27;t work on my skin type. I have super oily skin, after couple of use It made it very dry and red. I stopped using it on my face. But, I use it on my body.</li>
    <li> I had purchased the Oil of Olay brush a few months back and saw a difference in my skin but didn&#x27;t see the difference I was looking for. I tend to have oily, acne prone skin and I wanted something that would really help me clean my skin and help alleviate/prevent the acne. I LOVE this Clarisonic Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is absolutely no comparison and once you use the Clarisonic brush and go back to the Olay brush... you will feel like nothing is happeneing to your skin! haha The Clarisonic brush is completely different then other brushes on the market. It slightly vibrates while it brushes and leaves your skin feeling really clean and incredibly soft. I noticed a difference in my skin the first night I used it. Over the past month or so, my skin has transformed. The texture of my skin has improved, my pores are slightly smaller (they are definitely still there but much less noticable, and my acne (I only have a few breakouts here and there) is practically nonexistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did end up trading in my regular brush head for a deep pore and that made a HUGE difference. So if you have oily skin or acne prone skin, I would recommend using the deep pore brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the body brush... this is fantastic for areas prone to ingrown hairs. I use it around my bikini area pre-shave and it definitely minimizes ingrown hairs and red bumpms. Also, I use it after to keep them from re-appearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clarisonic wahses that come with it are ok, but I rather use my own skincare products. I tend to take my makeup off first by hand with something cheap and gentle like Cetephil and then I use either a benzoyl peroxide wash or a glycolic acid wash by Glytone with my Clarisonic. I know you don&#x27;t have to but I don&#x27;t like the idea of makeup getting all over my brush. Plus you can&#x27;t use the brush around your eyes anyway and I wear a ton of mascara! Either way, these cleansers in conjunction with my Clarisonic really keeps my skin nice and exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I know some people had issues with irritation. I use this morning and night... more than the recommended 60 sec. cycle (more like 3 cycles each time) and have very sensitive skin and yet I have no irritation with this brush at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clarisonic brush my be expensive but it is well worth every penny... don&#x27;t waste your money on knock offs... they will never compare to the real thing!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin but lately have been having very bad allergies and breaking out.  I guess my system has gone a bit haywire and it&#x27;s showing on my face.  I tried the olay spin brush and the neutrogena  spin scrubber (can&#x27;t remember the real names of the products, sorry!) but they didn&#x27;t really make a difference.  I got to the point where I was miserable (I didn&#x27;t have acne as a teen, so getting it in my late 30&#x27;s was frustrating) and, even though I was trying to wait to get it as a holiday gift, I broke down and bought it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin, after a little less than a week, was noticeably better.  Not just the breakouts, but the tone (?) as well.  It looks healthier.  The breakouts are gone as well - and that makes me very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a person with sensitive skin, I couldn&#x27;t use the face wash that it came with.  It was just too much for my skin.  Instead, I use it with my usual face wash which is for sensitive skin.  I do make sure to remove my makeup before using the clarisonic.  I just didn&#x27;t like the thought of spreading makeup-y soap around my face when I&#x27;m trying to clean it.  So I do have one extra step even though it is probably not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it my skin was a bit red, but knowing how sensitive my skin was I had just used it gently and the redness went away quickly (especially after i applied my moisturizer).  My skin got used to it quickly - only a few uses later and I don&#x27;t have any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the body brush yet.  It&#x27;s one of those features I had to have when I was deciding what to buy, but in reality I guess it&#x27;s a nice to have for me.  I just have too much body and not enough time I think :) .  But if I do try it I will update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this product.  You know how some people love the way their teeth feel after getting them cleaned at the dentist?  That&#x27;s how I feel about how my skin is after I use this.  It just feels clean and I love it.</li>
    <li> it is a good cleansing system. This is definetly better than washing your face with your bare hands. In my opinion, they can do better with the price but than again maybe you are better off buying a mia which is half the price. I don&#x27;t see it as a big difference...I ownly use this for my face. Perhaps, you can use the same brush for your body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin got significantly better with the use of this machine.  My co-workers have also purchased the unit and they are happy with their results.  It is easy to use and great for travel.  I would highly recommend.  The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was the fact that the unit starts to change color after several months.  The white becomes very dull.</li>
    <li> It works well when I use it.</li>
    <li> I am having a great  experience with the product. I recommend to every woman that wants her face to be every day better and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Questioned buying this - it&#x27;s expensive.  However, it does make my face feel softer and I feel as though it is cleaner.  Only problem is I still have wrinkles - guess it doesn&#x27;t work miracles... : )</li>
    <li> This machine is not cheap.  I really thought it would last well over the warranty period.  Nope.  A big waste of $200+ dollars.  I called the Clarisonic people and they said it couldn&#x27;t be fixed and I&#x27;d have to buy another.&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased a Bellapulse® Complete Facial Cleansing System for $19.99.  It&#x27;s not made as well.  Big deal.  It works just as well as the Clarisonic and comes with lots of different brushes, lotions and cleansers.  If it dies with the warranty, I&#x27;ll buy another one.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years now (am/pm) and I couldn&#x27;t imagine my washing routine without it! I am over 40 and was prone to an occasional breakout, and the Clarisonic keeps my skin clear and free of any dry patches. More recently, my teenage son has acne...after the daily antibiotics and prescription face creams as well as monthly chemical peels, I purchased a deep cleaning attachment so he could try using it. The Clarisonic jump started his healing process. It cleared blackheads within 10 days and helps keep his skin clear! (He uses it once a day, in the evening).</li>
    <li> I have a friend who loves her Clarisonic - but I was hesitant because I have very dry sensitive skin that is prone to irritation.  Once I studied all the models (Pro, Plus, Mia, etc) I decided if it was going to work for me, I was going to use it on my full body - hence my decision to get the Pro (with optional body brush handle).  The first week, I eased into it every other day, had a mild irritation using their soaps so I returned to my basic Cetaphil that I have been using for years.  Within the next week, my skin glowed!  Well worth the investment for gentle exfoliation and cleansing!  I also encourage purchasers to get the travel/storage bag that is offered by other sellers on Amazon.  The Clarisonic, charger and spare heads are too bulky to fit most cosmetics or small travel bags - and the Clarisonic bag offered is also water resistant, as well as holding all the parts.</li>
    <li> This unit is a replacement for the first one my wife had.  It does what she wants, and nicely.  There is one issue with them though.  They aren&#x27;t as waterproof as one might think.  Like I said, this is a replacement for the first one that was all corroded inside and had to be thrown out.</li>
    <li> Good, but need charging</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Clarisonic for about a year now. Before purchasing, I had noticed some bad reviews regarding the battery life and charging, but I decided to give it a try as Amazon has always been good about returns when needed. I have had no problems at all with charging or the battery, in fact I normally only charge it about once a month (overnight) and it has been great for the year I&#x27;ve had it. It also seems to be pretty sturdy, although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend dropping it, I have dropped it a few times and it hasn&#x27;t broken yet. As far a cleaning, I didn&#x27;t really notice that it was working until I had been using it for about 2 - 3 weeks. I do think it has helped keep my pores clearer and, in turn, less acne, but I can&#x27;t say that I have noticed smaller looking pores. The best judge for me was that I forgot to pack it when I left for a week long cruise and within like 2 days my skin just didn&#x27;t feel the same as I had gotten used to and I ended up with some acne by the time I got home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that, although I like the fact that it does the timing to let you know when to move to different parts of your face, I wish there was an option to not use that feature.</li>
    <li> Ok so, I&#x27;ll start with the only cons : the price. It is pricey but it worth every penny!! My sensitive skin even appreciate the sensitive skin brush! I use it once a day every day and I have to tell you... I don&#x27;t need make up remover anymore, just a gentle cleanser and the Clarisonic do the rest! I just use Rose water to remove the make up on my eyes. I can not leave a review on Clarisonic cleansing product because I didn&#x27;t used them... I wasn&#x27;t sure that my skin can handle a brush plus new product so... I didn&#x27;t take any risks. I use the body brush once a week with a body scrub and it does a wonderful job! The battery last 2 weeks in average (I think it&#x27;s a good average) and I leave the Clarisonic on its base al night long and ready for 2 others weeks.</li>
    <li> One of my friends recommended the Clarisonic PLUS for my skin concerns.  I am now over 40, and boy, does the skin sure show aging something fierce!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has remarked about the smoothness and clarity improvements in my skin texture and tone since I began using my Clarisonic PLUS.  Now, that&#x27;s remarkable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled with this product.</li>
    <li> I feel like my face is &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; but since I began using this (6 weeks ago), my skin has broken out something terrible.  The directions say that you don&#x27;t need to remove your makeup before use, but I feel like I&#x27;m just grinding the makeup into my pores.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product if I &amp;#34;wash before I wash&amp;#34;, and I am happy with the purchase, but I was expecting to have red carpet skin, and instead I look like a high schooler.  Hopefully my skin begins to clear up and I get a glowing complexion.</li>
    <li> My sisters and niece all had one and now I can see why. My skin feels great and I look forward to using it each day! I have rosacea and my face feels and looks better.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this to me after she had been using one for a year.  I am thankful I purchased this as I love it!  It leaves my skin feeling like silk every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I only use the clarisonic maybe a few times a week at most and today went to use it and it&#x27;s broken. just makes a weird noise and barely shakes. Amazon&#x27;s policy is ONE month, checking with Clarisonic. Cannot believe it already broke.</li>
    <li> The package does not come all products broken into picture. Came just two of creams discrimados the other two did not come! Lacked product!!</li>
    <li> Returned product the day after I received it! I purchased the Clarisonic Plus in white from Beauty Direct Mall; the order was fulfilled by Amazon. Upon receipt, I inspected the product to ensure that the item I received was authentic. First off, I noticed that the bottom of the handle was scratched, which I initially believed was due to the item being used previously (i.e. repeatedly placed in and taken out of the base charger). Upon further research online, the product serial number is located at the bottom of the handle. The scratches were a result of the serial number being scratched off!!!! No serial number means that I will never be able to use the warranty if it were ever needed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift, but did not give it. I have requested a return on this item but as of yet have heard NOTHING from the company.  Not happy or very satisfied with customer service. From others, I understand the product is very good - cannot comment!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been one month, but I have noticed that my skin seems much softer and smoother. I would recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I upgraded to this version of the Clarisonic because I wanted the body scrub brush.  It&#x27;s a great product and I would recommend to my friends</li>
</ol>
