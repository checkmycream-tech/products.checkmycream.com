      <li>If you want to take the shimmer down a notch, just run some powder over it and it works just great! :D</li>
      <li>nice shade and good texture, goes on better with my own quality brush.  </li>
      <li>Love this eyeshadows, use them almost every day&lt;br /&gt;arrive</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I love that they have so many close color options mattes and shimmers.</li>
      <li>I have used this Product for years, and it is a top of the line eye shadow for me.</li>
      <li>and it gave off more of a creamy color.</li>
      <li>It also has pretty good staying power and goes on very smoothly and evenly.  </li>
      <li>Great product and highly recommend the seller.</li>
      <li>Color is awesome, not matte, but not super sparkly, more of a shimmer.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I got this looking for something shimmery and light.</li>
      <li>Very shiny, has a nice look and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>its so pretty!</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s exactly what I needed!</li>
      <li>The color is very potent and sharp, so constant reapplication is definitely not necessary, which is impressive.</li>
      <li>i like it very much.</li>
      <li>I spent a great deal of money searching for a cheaper version of a bold white.</li>
      <li>Isn&#x27;t as white as i thought it would be but its okay</li>
      <li>Some people don&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s pretty shiny</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Maybelline since I first began using makeup, and can rely on their products.</li>
      <li>I have previously bought this brand in another shade, also good, so overall this brand is good for a low cost.</li>
      <li>Maybelline seems to be pretty good about maintaining the same product and only changing the packaging once in a while</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for white, this will work just fine as that is what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>This eye-shadow really does its job</li>
      <li>and it really brightens my eyes when i swipe it under my bottom lashes and on the insides of my eyes.</li>
      <li>i was so very disapointed...</li>
      <li>this one really brightens up the eyes</li>
      <li>i was disapointed, when the product came this morning, i was excited to try it,,, but when i opened it, the case is open, i think this is a return items...</li>
      <li>It has that bold white color that everyone is looking for.</li>
      <li>, I think I&#x27;m a bit too mature for that whole Sparkly look.</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of white for under my brow</li>
      <li>but it gives a very mature metallic shimmer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just right, at least on my fair skin--enough shimmer to add a little sheen without looking at all glittery or overdone.  </li>
      <li>Just what I expected and it arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>the case is old..</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to buy the whole set of eye-shadows because I only use white/creamy color..</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t even need a base to look nice, as most shadows do.</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re careful with it and have a reasonable expectation, this product may be for you.</li>
      <li>i use it to lighten up the inner corners of my eyes with other eye shadows and it works very well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find eye shadow in white or off white in a single application, so needless to say, love it :)</li>

    <li> I love that they have so many close color options mattes and shimmers. this one really brightens up the eyes</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friend, she wanted white eyeshadow, and I thought this was white till I got it and it gave off more of a creamy color.</li>
    <li> i like it very much. i use it to lighten up the inner corners of my eyes with other eye shadows and it works very well. it looks almost shinny nude and i like it</li>

Very shiny, has a nice look and lasts all day. If you want to take the shimmer down a notch, just run some powder over it and it works just great! :D</li>

    <li> This eye shadow is basically what is to be expected at this price. The color is very potent and sharp, so constant reapplication is definitely not necessary, which is impressive. Delicate handling is require; one drop on the floor and the powder will crumble and all fall out- never to be used again. It is also very hard to clean off surfaces, should this incident happen to you as well. But if you&#x27;re careful with it and have a reasonable expectation, this product may be for you.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeshadows, use them almost every day&lt;br /&gt;arrive just on time</li>
    <li> love this shadow!! I use it as my base coat for my eye-shadow almost every day. It has that bold white color that everyone is looking for. I spent a great deal of money searching for a cheaper version of a bold white. HERE IT IS.</li>
    <li> I have used this Product for years, and it is a top of the line eye shadow for me. It stays on all day and I just like the way it makes my eyes look!</li>
    <li> Great colour. Easy to apply. Perfect for every day wear.</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived in perfect order!Was thrilled to get this product which is good quality and a great price.  Will order again!</li>
    <li> Love this shadow! Color is awesome, not matte, but not super sparkly, more of a shimmer. I predominately use it underneath my eyebrows and the inside of my eye as a highlighter. Very satisfied. Maybelline seems to be pretty good about maintaining the same product and only changing the packaging once in a while so hopefully I will be buying this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> nice shade and good texture, goes on better with my own quality brush.  I have previously bought this brand in another shade, also good, so overall this brand is good for a low cost.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of white for under my brow</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find eye shadow in white or off white in a single application, so needless to say, love it :)</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin so this eyeshadow is a perfect eyebrow and cheek bone highlighter. I only by 2 a year as they last a long time.</li>
    <li> This shadow in Vanilla Shimmer is my go-to eyeshadow for highlighting my brow bone and the inner corner of my eye.  It&#x27;s just right, at least on my fair skin--enough shimmer to add a little sheen without looking at all glittery or overdone.  Subtle but still actually does its job as a highlighter.  Just perfect.  It also has pretty good staying power and goes on very smoothly and evenly.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this eye shadow!!! 😍😍😍</li>
    <li> I use this vanilla shadow as a base for my eyeliner, as well as an eyeshadow.  It lasts all day and keeps my eyeliner from fading. This color also brightens my eyes. I&#x27;ve used Maybelline since I first began using makeup, and can rely on their products.</li>
    <li> i was disapointed, when the product came this morning, i was excited to try it,,, but when i opened it, the case is open, i think this is a return items... and when i tried it.. goshhh the color is no good.. i was so very disapointed... the case is old..</li>
    <li> Just what I expected and it arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Was looking for an alternative to a super expensive brand and this got the job done.</li>
    <li> Plastic clear cover was completely cracked and broken when we received it!</li>
    <li> Way too shimmery for my taste.unfortunately, I think I&#x27;m a bit too mature for that whole Sparkly look. It&#x27;s just to for me.</li>
    <li> I use this as a highlighter under my brow, in the inner corners of my eyes, and above my cheekbones. Does a great job and blends easily.</li>
    <li> This eye-shadow really does its job well! I didn&#x27;t want to buy the whole set of eye-shadows because I only use white/creamy color.. And this was perfect!
