      <li>I strongly recommended.</li>
      <li>My hair is easy to comb or brush through and feels fantastic.</li>
      <li>It even worked great in Brooklyn, NY humidity earlier this summer.</li>
      <li>, more important makes my hair soft and silky, and tames flyaways.&lt;br</li>
      <li>A bit pricey compared to retail store pricing but is it worth it?</li>
      <li>but I know it&#x27;s well worth the wait.</li>
      <li>there are other, better products sold at high-end beauty retailers, but I didn&#x27;t feel like spending more time or money to find out.</li>
      <li>This has anything, cheap or high dollar, on the shelves beat.</li>
      <li>I have long and kind of wavy hair (and a lot of hair too).</li>
      <li>I have been using this stuff since it first came out.</li>
      <li>It does not leave my hair greasy or oily looking - just soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>IT helps keep my hair straight and soft and easily manageable while drying it.</li>
      <li>It is very hard to find in local stores and I am so happy that I was able to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Sunsilk on my hair for a long time and love it.</li>
      <li>I searched for years for a product that left my hair feeling healthy and smooth after showers, and finally I found this one!  </li>
      <li>I have goofy hair, but Sunsilk helps calm it down.</li>
      <li>The new silver bottle (the smaller 5 ounce version) was just as good, but recently disappeared from the shelves again.  </li>
      <li>Truly a great buy, recommend for all with extremely curly and dry hair.</li>
      <li>So I trimmed them off and started using this again, and it works really well.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>The shipping on this product was incredibly fast.</li>
      <li>With very curly and often frizzy hair, this product works wonders.  </li>
      <li>and I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair since she is not allowed to use condition (she uses too much)</li>
      <li>She has very curly hair</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>This keeps my hair smooth and flat all day!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t generally like purchasing products in bulk, because I always figure, what if something better comes out later on?</li>
      <li>She is a mixed chick and it works better than mixed chicks brand.</li>
      <li>I dreaded the idea of buying countless more bottles of conditioner, using them only once or twice, and wasting the rest.  </li>
      <li>I have very curly hair and use it so frequently that it is easier to order online and ship a 6 pack to my house</li>
      <li>So I was pleasantly surprised when I found this very affordable cream that turned out to be my dream hair product.</li>
      <li>I got the box of 7, because i&#x27;m super scared they might discontinue it, and i want this product for the long haul.</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair and have spent years trying to find the right products to maintain and control it.</li>
      <li>Just a little of this product after the shower makes my hair strait and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>I have straight, medium, Asian hair, and this product keeps my hair moisturized and my flyaways at bay.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>This is by far my #1 pick on hair products to make your hair soft.</li>
      <li>A conditioner that leaves my curly hair silky but not limp.  </li>
      <li>It also leaves my hair soft.</li>
      <li>Well, at least I have 6 bottles and with the amount that you use (size of a nickel), it should last us a good long time.  </li>
      <li>I usually apply mine to top of head and some to back area after lifting hair off neck.</li>
      <li>The new product is nowhere near the same.</li>
      <li>Helps control frizz on humid days like no other product.  </li>
      <li>Thank you again Amazon for making hard to find products available.</li>
      <li>Her hair was so dry and couldn&#x27;t form her natural curl.</li>

<li> Her hair was so dry and couldn&#x27;t form her natural curl.</li>
<li> It really helps protect your hair and slow the rate of split ends (there is no way to completely get rid of split ends, except through regular trimming), especially if you are trying to grow out your hair.</li>
<li> It leaves hair soft, tangle-free, and moisturized without weighing it down.  </li>
<li> I swim 3-4 times a wk, turning my colored grey hair into straw.  </li>
<li> I have been searching for this product in stores for a long time.  </li>
<li> I have thick and wavy hair that is very hard to get a brush through most days.  </li>
<li> One bottle last a long time because you only have to put a small amount in palm rub hands together and apply to hair.</li>
<li> I hope it is around for a very long time!  </li>
<li> I purchased a bottle at a time until all of a sudden it wasn&#x27;t in stores anymore... not cool.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t take a lot so be careful on your usage.</li>
<li> My daughter has long, (down to her bottom) hair.</li>
<li> Hair is usually curled after only 2 hours set.</li>
<li> I was too cheap and lazy to buy another, but then when i started growing out my hair, I got split ends like crazy.</li>
<li> This hydrates my hair without weighing it down</li>
<li> When they stopped selling it in stores, I looked for a replacement product but couldn&#x27;t find anything that didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it a greasy mess.</li>
<li> I use it every day before I blow dry because my hair is thick and can get out of control.</li>
<li> I cried when I could not fine this product in store any longer; what happened?</li>
<li> It has brought out the curls beautifully no more affro.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve spent a LOT of money on very expensive products that just ended up weighing it down, or not working at all.</li>
<li> however, this is so much less expensive on amazon than in walmart.</li>
<li> My daughter LOVES this product, but it is getting very hard to find!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product.  They need to just put this back on the market (in stores).  Because online it&#x27;s just too bloody expensive.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.  The product itself is excellent, like none other.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for this product.  I have very curly hair and use it so frequently that it is easier to order online and ship a 6 pack to my house so I have it and dont need to shop every week.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for this product in stores for a long time.  I used this for a while, but the company restyled the bottle and my local stores did not have it in stock for months.  The new silver bottle (the smaller 5 ounce version) was just as good, but recently disappeared from the shelves again.  I finally decided to search online and found it on Amazon.  With very curly and often frizzy hair, this product works wonders.  It does not leave my hair greasy or oily looking - just soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a must have product if you spend any time in a swimming pool. Combats the brittle, dryness that chlorine water causes.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and have spent years trying to find the right products to maintain and control it. I&#x27;ve spent a LOT of money on very expensive products that just ended up weighing it down, or not working at all. So I was pleasantly surprised when I found this very affordable cream that turned out to be my dream hair product. It even worked great in Brooklyn, NY humidity earlier this summer. I can&#x27;t say enough. I only wish I could find it in the stores out here in LA, but it seems to be discontinued. Thank God Amazon continues to stock it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It makes my hair soft and manageable.  It lasts awhile and is a good price.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it lasts for hours. I do not understand why they stop making these and I know I am not the only one wondering.</li>
    <li> I searched for years for a product that left my hair feeling healthy and smooth after showers, and finally I found this one!  I purchased a bottle at a time until all of a sudden it wasn&#x27;t in stores anymore... not cool.  I dreaded the idea of buying countless more bottles of conditioner, using them only once or twice, and wasting the rest.  Luckily I found a 6-pack of Sunsilk Hydra TLC on Amazon, and my hair has been happy ever since :)  It leaves hair soft, tangle-free, and moisturized without weighing it down.  Perfect for me!</li>
    <li> This and castor oil - nothing compares. however, this is so much less expensive on amazon than in walmart.</li>
    <li> This product should never be taken off the market. It is absolutely wonderful. One bottle last a long time because you only have to put a small amount in palm rub hands together and apply to hair. I usually apply mine to top of head and some to back area after lifting hair off neck. Hair is usually curled after only 2 hours set. If hair is not shampooed the next day, curls are still in place.  I hope it is around for a very long time!  No more hot combs are perms needed with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff since it first came out. It smells so good! avoid using it on your roots unless you want to look like you just stuck ur head in a used frying pan.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! Couldn&#x27;t find it in stores! But now I did on here! Yay!</li>
    <li> Yikes, can&#x27;t believe I bought the 6-pack of this, but...I need it! I don&#x27;t generally like purchasing products in bulk, because I always figure, what if something better comes out later on? But I couldn&#x27;t risk it with this stuff. When they stopped selling it in stores, I looked for a replacement product but couldn&#x27;t find anything that didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it a greasy mess. Granted, I was only looking around in drugstores and places like Target...I&#x27;m sure there are other, better products sold at high-end beauty retailers, but I didn&#x27;t feel like spending more time or money to find out. I have straight, medium, Asian hair, and this product keeps my hair moisturized and my flyaways at bay. It&#x27;s a great, not-too-expensive product, and I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;ve got 6 bottles to keep my hair smooth until something better comes along.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have goofy hair, but Sunsilk helps calm it down. The shipping on this product was incredibly fast. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love the original Sunsilk products! I have been buying up what I can find since they changed the formula.  The new product is nowhere near the same.</li>
    <li> This is the only product to give my daughter some moisture in her hair. Her hair was so dry and couldn&#x27;t form her natural curl. She had a Jackson Five affro. It has brought out the curls beautifully no more affro. I was truly amazed at the difference in just one time useing it on my daughter. My friends and family around me couldn&#x27;t believe the difference either. Truly a great buy, recommend for all with extremely curly and dry hair.</li>
    <li> If you want strait, no freeze and easy to manage hair this product is great. I have long and kind of wavy hair (and a lot of hair too). Just a little of this product after the shower makes my hair strait and easy to manage. I strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> Found Sunsilk Hydra TLC!!! I have been looking for this product for a while, love the smell, more important makes my hair soft and silky, and tames flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely order from Impossible Discounts, received package in 3 days!!!</li>
    <li> This has anything, cheap or high dollar, on the shelves beat. It is great stuff and a shame they quit making it.</li>
    <li> I swim 3-4 times a wk, turning my colored grey hair into straw.  Sunsilk Hydra reallly softens my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Since this product is not longer sold in San Antonio, I had to buy it online.</li>
    <li> I had a lot of samples of this leave-in-conditioner....thought I would never run out.  But it did!!!!  Oh, no....I thought!!!!!  So glad I found it on Amazon.  Both my daughter and I use it.  I could afford a more expensive hair product but why should I?  This stuff is the best conditioner on the market.  I can&#x27;t understand why it was discontinued.  Bad decision.  Well, at least I have 6 bottles and with the amount that you use (size of a nickel), it should last us a good long time.  If you have never tried this conditioner....don&#x27;t!!!!!  This way there will be more for me!  : )</li>
    <li> This is by far my #1 pick on hair products to make your hair soft. It&#x27;s a shame they discontinued it. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years, Sunsilk needs to bring it back.</li>
    <li> My mom uses this on my niece. She is a mixed chick and it works better than mixed chicks brand.</li>
    <li> This stuff was recomended by my girlfriend as the best leave in hair conditioner she has ever tried. Also can&#x27;t find in stores so buy it here.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sunsilk on my hair for a long time and love it. It is very hard to find in local stores and I am so happy that I was able to find it on Amazon.  I have thick and wavy hair that is very hard to get a brush through most days.  This has changed since I started using Sunsilk.  I put a nickel size amount in my hands, rub it through my hair really good and concentrate a lot on my ends to help minimize split eneds.  My hair is easy to comb or brush through and feels fantastic. No heaviness to it at all.  Just a nice shine and easy to manage now.</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVES this product, but it is getting very hard to find!  She has very curly hair and this keeps it under control for her.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It really helps protect your hair and slow the rate of split ends (there is no way to completely get rid of split ends, except through regular trimming), especially if you are trying to grow out your hair. It also leaves my hair soft. I bought one bottle and loved it. I was too cheap and lazy to buy another, but then when i started growing out my hair, I got split ends like crazy. So I trimmed them off and started using this again, and it works really well. I got the box of 7, because i&#x27;m super scared they might discontinue it, and i want this product for the long haul.</li>
    <li> This brand (Sunsilk) has been discontinued but I absolutely love this stuff so when I saw that Amazon had it in a 6 pack, I had to buy it! This hydrates my hair without weighing it down and I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair since she is not allowed to use condition (she uses too much) and I put this on after her shower. IT helps keep my hair straight and soft and easily manageable while drying it. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot so be careful on your usage.</li>
    <li> So hard to find!!!!!! My daughter has long, (down to her bottom) hair. It is very expensive and discontinued.It breaks my heart that they did that.</li>
    <li> A conditioner that leaves my curly hair silky but not limp.  Helps control frizz on humid days like no other product.  Even repeated use does not leave residue.  Thank you again Amazon for making hard to find products available.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores anymore. I use it every day before I blow dry because my hair is thick and can get out of control. This keeps my hair smooth and flat all day!</li>
    <li> I have looked in every store in my area for this produce. My husband, my daughters, and I all LOVE it and cannot find it anywhere! So glad I was able to find some</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner I have EVER USED! I cried when I could not fine this product in store any longer; what happened? Any way... Yes, great conditioner, great for towel dried hair and then styling.  A bit pricey compared to retail store pricing but is it worth it? I just bought a 6 pack didn&#x27;t I? I haven&#x27;t received it yet but I know it&#x27;s well worth the wait. Love the nutri-keratin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Leaves my hair silky and shiny, and my hair always smells great! I lalways stock up because I don&#x27;t like to run out.</li>
