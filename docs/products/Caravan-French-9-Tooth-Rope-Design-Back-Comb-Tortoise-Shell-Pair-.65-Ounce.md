      <li>Love them!</li>
      <li>She liked them.</li>
      <li>These combs are very pretty and look great in my hair.</li>
      <li>They are fabulous and hold a lot of hair!</li>
      <li>and they poke through more than I would like.</li>
      <li>That causes it to feel unstable and since most of the weight is at that end, it falls out easily.</li>
      <li>Would like to find some with shorter tines/teeth because I have fine hair</li>
      <li>My hair is fine</li>
      <li>Smooth teeth.  </li>
      <li>Very nice solid combs.</li>
      <li>It is very pretty, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work in my hair without using additional pins and hairspray.</li>
      <li>These combs are so pretty!  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>My mom really likes it!</li>
      <li>I gave these 5 stars because they are exactly what they say they are.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very nice quality, but the teeth are too long and the scalloped edges don&#x27;t sit against my head, but sticks out about an inch when I use it for a french twist.  </li>
      <li>the combs were to big for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>They are a little larger that I expected, but work great.</li>
      <li>My hair is very course, thick and heavy so these stay in place well and are of good quality</li>
      <li>The teeth don&#x27;t go far back enough toward the decorative edge, so that leaves about an inch that sticks up.</li>
      <li>Large and heavy.  </li>

    <li> Large and heavy.  Threw the away.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and well-made, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. The teeth don&#x27;t go far back enough toward the decorative edge, so that leaves about an inch that sticks up. That causes it to feel unstable and since most of the weight is at that end, it falls out easily. The teeth are only slightly curved, so it won&#x27;t lay against my head. It is very pretty, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work in my hair without using additional pins and hairspray.</li>
    <li> Very nice solid combs. Smooth teeth.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Look just like pictured and what I wanted. Would like to find some with shorter tines/teeth because I have fine hair and they poke through more than I would like. Great service.</li>
    <li> Love them!  Hold my hair wonderfully!</li>
