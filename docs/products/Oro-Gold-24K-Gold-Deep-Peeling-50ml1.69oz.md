      <li>My skin is the best it&#x27;s even been.</li>

      <li>Eye Serum is an ideal product to make your puffiness disappear.</li>
      <li>I got it for an incredible price on Amazon at around Christmas time two years ago and ended up buying it in bulk.</li>
      <li>Stay away if you know what is good for you!</li>
      <li>These sales reps have been trained good!</li>
      <li>LOVED it!  </li>
      <li>The Orogold store leaves no effort when it comes to offering you with a beautiful and luxurious setting.</li>
      <li>Just my comfy computer area and my beautiful laptop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Anyway, the product is great.</li>
      <li>But both the peeling exfoliant and the day cream work great</li>
      <li>It worked great.</li>
      <li>So hey, if I don’t get a luxurious store and get a discount on the product, I’m as happy as I can</li>
      <li>and I am happy with it.</li>
      <li>GREAT TIP</li>
      <li>It leaves skin feeling great.  </li>
      <li>I am so happy and so grateful for this product.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because of the great reviews.</li>
      <li>I experienced a burning tingling sensation which would not go away for some time .</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get carried away because of the great results, just use it twice a week.</li>
      <li>my face is ALREADY clearing up the bit of acne I do have GREATLY.</li>
      <li>I bought this product and absolutely love it!!</li>
      <li>After doing more research I discovered that they pay people over seas to write reviews for their products!!</li>
      <li>Anyways, I love to look at my skin on a magnifying mirror after each use and the results are just perfect.</li>
      <li>Love this peel and am upset that the price has rose from $85 to $150!!!!!!  </li>
      <li>But, my jawline healed just fine and now that i use it as directed, i am VERY impressed.  </li>
      <li>I have good genes from my grandmother and mother when it comes to skin</li>

      <li>Good thing I got that discount then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is that good.</li>

      <li>While the product might have good points, I am upset that I was told at the  Oro boutique (Los Angeles) that the product was \\&quot;returnable within</li>
      <li>So, no matter how good this product might turn out to be, deceptive selling practices will keep me from EVER purchasing from this line again.    </li>
      <li>I am not even saying these might not be good products</li>
      <li>He practically threw the receipt at me and was again trying to lecture me when I cut him off and told him to have a good day and walked out.  </li>
      <li>Smooth, great pores, nothing clogged...worth every penny!</li>
      <li>good product.</li>
      <li>and I have really loved the way it cleanses my skin.</li>

      <li>The store in Hawaii Hilton Village is beautiful and elegant.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff, it&#x27;s a great product from a good line.</li>
      <li>I think that the Orogold 24K Deep Peeling is a superb option for anyone wanting the perfect exfoliator.</li>

      <li>You will be very pleased with the result.</li>
      <li>So I kind of laughed and said yes</li>
      <li>It this was some sales person, I would have looked right through him/ her; but this was my best friend stating so.</li>
      <li>Oh, I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy after reading these reviews!  </li>
      <li>Bishh please it better be made of gold for that price!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Disgrace. Worst thing I&#x27;ve ever put on my skin.</li>
    <li> I used the first Orogold Deep Peel at their Vegas store and I was really impressed. Came back home and ordered for the product online. I must say that my skin looks so much better and smoother ever since I started using the Orogold Deep Peeling. What this product basically does is that it sloughs off your dead skin cells while moisturizing your skin at the same time. This ensures that you don’t suffer from any irritation or problems and that your skin feels smooth and gentle as well. I noticed so many bad reviews here, I am shocked. All I can say is that these people are either saying it from the guilt of purchasing products above their budgets or because they didn’t even use the product correctly. I am now into my third refill and it works wonders for me.</li>
    <li> It works well, but the secret to getting the most results is letting it sit on your skin for at least 45 sec-1 minute. Also, before rinsing/wiping it off, rub your fingers in a circular motion to help it work faster.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  Sloughs off the dead skin layer without damaging.  Safe to use a couple of times a week.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I found the Orogold Deep Peeling to be an incredible product. I am so happy with its performance that I simply had to write this review. I use the Orogold Deep Peeling twice every week. Before using the product, I used to suffer from infrequent acne breakouts and I always felt as if my cleansers weren&#x27;t doing enough. However, ever since I started using the Deep Peeling, not only has my acne breakouts reduced, my skin feels cleaner and softer as well. The product has brought about dramatic improvements to the way my skin looks and I just love how soft and smooth it feels. I haven&#x27;t been breaking out as often as before and I am now able to move around makeup free as well. When it comes to acne marks, I have seen a visible difference as well. My acne marks are more diminished and I believe over the next few months of product usage, they should disappear completely. Many people are scared of deep peels because they are powerful products that exfoliate a lot of dead skin. But Oro Gold has come up with a deep peel which is as gentle as your everyday cleanser, provided you use it exactly as they direct you to.</li>
    <li> Like most of the reviews here, I was also pulled by a sales associate from the Oro Gold store at the mall.  She showed me how it works on my arm and I was amazed.  She was offering me the birth set for $200 and I told her I have to think about it first.  Then she lowered it to $150 for the damaged box.  I still didn&#x27;t buy because I want to do a research on the items first.  When I came home I was really surprised that it was so cheap at Amazon.  I ordered right away and shared it to my friends and family who also ordered it.  So far I am loving the results. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now.  It makes my pores look smaller, get rids of my whiteheads and leaves my face soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> The OROGOLD 24K Deep Peeling is one of the first products that I purchased on my own for my skin. Till now, I was just using the products being used by my mum, but somehow they convinced me to purchase the product for myself. I thought I was gonna get a mouthful for spending so much on a single product, but luckily for me, my mum fell in love with it as well. I really liked the OROGOLD Peeling because it made the skin feel really really soft and smooth. The whole experience that this product has to offer makes the price worth it. It is definitely the best peeling that I have tried. And mum plans to hit their stores in the near future for more products. YAY.</li>
    <li> I was somehow talked into buying this after a brief visit at the mall. They originally had the price on it for $170 but I told them I&#x27;m from out of state visiting and am a student and can&#x27;t afford such a high priced item and would have to think on it, so the guy pulled out his calculator and was like okay I&#x27;ll make you a deal but you can&#x27;t tell anyone, so he punched some numbers into his calculator and showed me the price - $50! That&#x27;s crazy, it&#x27;s supposed to last a year so I did the math and it totals up to about $4 a month or so for skin care so I figured it was worth a shot. This was the first time I have ever fallen for a sales purchase buy I don&#x27;t regret it yet.</li>
    <li> Love this peel and am upset that the price has rose from $85 to $150!!!!!!  Hmmmph! Why the suddent jump?????</li>
    <li> I agree with Kevin Little&#x27;s review, I am sad to report.     While the product might have good points, I am upset that I was told at the  Oro boutique (Los Angeles) that the product was \\&quot;returnable within 7 days\\&quot;.  Then, once  they wear you down and you actually buy a product, they fold the receipt in half and put it into the bag with your product.    I did not see until I got home that the receipt says: \\&quot;no returns, exchanges only\\&quot;    So, no matter how good this product might turn out to be, deceptive selling practices will keep me from EVER purchasing from this line again.    Very interesting / sad to see that obfuscating the truth seems to be a top-down directive from management.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WALK INTO AN OROGOLD SHOP!&lt;br /&gt;Well, If you read this comment it will be probably too late. It happened to me too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once did the mistake to accept the sample the sale assistant was handing me in the street and from that moment it was already too late. They have such aggressive sales techniques that you won&#x27;t be able to leave the shop without buying anything. Once the first eye contact is made they literally force you into the shop and will make pressure until you buy one of their expensive and useless products.&lt;br /&gt;I am usually not an impulsive buyer and thought  I could follow him into the shop and then politely tell that I am not interested or would have a though about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once inside he will start by asking you a couple of questions to pinpoint who you are so he can adapt his sales tactic and tell you what you want to hear. He will of course guess that you are 5 years less than your actual age and will explain why it is important to take good care of your skin (as if we did not know). Then he will bull*** about their brand, \\&quot;why it is not better known in Europe\\&quot;, \\&quot;who is using it\\&quot; (apparently some famous stars that I do not know and do not care about at all!), he will emphasise that it is a natural product and that gold is a really good product for your beauty (gold is actually a very small part of the composition of the product and honestly I have doubt about its use in cosmetics). Then he will speak about price and show a catalogue with products ranging from 800£ to 2000£ and tell that for you it will only be 200£ for a face cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I refused his offer and he magically cut the price by two. I still made clear that I did not want to buy anything and told him I would do some research online and come back if interested. To what he started laughing and continued to find the right arguments. After another 5 minutes conversation he applied his so-called \\&quot;personal daily discount fare\\&quot; and I was \\&quot;offered\\&quot; the product for 60£. Seeing that I was still reluctant he also offered me a 1 hour facial treatment for free. I finally accepted...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it sounds ridiculous seeing like this, I am usually not an impulsive buyer and do not spend a lot in cosmetics but there I was just trapped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back home I opened the package to see that the cream pot had already been opened (or at least was not sealed properly). I ruched on the internet looking for reviews on them and read that it is usual that customers complain about already opened products and that Orogold do not have any return policy. So I did not even waste my time returning to the shop. I looked at the ticket where he said I will find the phone number to call to book my \\&quot;free facial treatment\\&quot;. It was a strange number from Middle-East that I did not even bother to call and through the receipt and the number straight away. I finally decided to try the product and of course this product is nothing special at all! It smells glue and has the same sticky consistence so I suppose there is some glue in the product, I used it for a couple of weeks (he told me to use it once a week only) and after 4 times I through the product in the bathroom bin with this feeling of taking a 60£ note out of my wallet and doing exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then for a couple of weeks I was systematically avoiding passing in the street of this shop (New Bond Street) fro fear of seeing that guy again. After a while I decided it was ridiculous and stopped doing that and every day I see poor \\&quot;customers\\&quot; in the process of being tricked by those sales assistants and it makes me so furious! I should tell them but of course I do not there, but at least I will post this comment anywhere I can and hope I will be able to save some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, we always learn from our mistake :)as still reluctant he also offered me a 1 hour facial treatment for free.

    <li> this product did not help me... I was persuaded to buy it, apparently it was going to help with my acne and a range of things. haha.. I have never been persuaded before to buy anything, those sales men are Good!! anyways, their moisturizing cream is heaven, but this... did not create a change in my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I received my order quickly and the packaging was Great!  Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with my skin for decades. I also had a huge scar across my forehead from a car accident.  I tried scarguard and expensive products but they didn&#x27;t do much. I started using this once a week about 6 months ago.  To this day, the scar keeps getting smaller and smaller.  Not trying to be graphic, but I want you to understand how well this works: My accident was so bad that my skull was showing all the way accross the top of my head(probably worse then you are imagining).  A skin graph would have been 30K.  This scar is praticially invisible now. It used to be a huge line across my head...now, you cannot even see it. Even now, It looks better then it did 2 months ago.  Once a week...and my skin is soft.  My scar is only visible when I move my facial muscles a certain way because of muscle damage, but the skin over it is almost perfect.  I got a friend of mine some to use on a scar from the port from Kemo. She&#x27;s having the same result I am.   If you have a scar that you wish you didn&#x27;t, this is the product for you!  Just make sure the scar is fully healed.  Its gentle enough not to harm it or aggravate it, but its strong enough to get all the scar tissue off(over time).  And I mean ALL the scar tissue.   Just make sure your skin is clean and DRY when you use it.</li>
    <li> I was stopped by an Oro Gold salesman at our local outdoor mall. Although the product demonstration really impressed me, I couldn&#x27;t afford the price. After coming home and reading reviews and finding the DeadSeaMall&#x27;s deeply discounted and affordable prices, I purchased the peel and the day moisturizer.     Well after using this product for only a week, my skin looks and feels younger. My husband came home from work the other day and said, \\&quot;What did you do to your face? You look younger!\\&quot; My pores are diminished, my skin is smoother, and my skin looks brighter.    I would never have been able to afford this if it wasn&#x27;t for the Deadseamall.    I am looking into the eye serums now... would love something to diminish the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and avoid products with glycolic acid, hydroxy acid, and even fragranced skin care. Oro gold deep peeling exfoliates without any redness.  I love this stuff, it&#x27;s a great product from a good line.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I cant wait for my for my Instant stretching mask and moisturizer. This product is amazing. I love it. Beat paying retail price for it.</li>
    <li> I take pretty good care of my skin. I didn&#x27;t like any other exfoliator I tried before until this product was introduced to me at the mall. The mall price is higher than Amazon&#x27;s.. I don&#x27;t get it. Anyways, I love to look at my skin on a magnifying mirror after each use and the results are just perfect. GREAT TIP (I do it every day when I wash my face): rinse your face with SUPER MEGA ULTRA iced cold water. It hurts a little but it is so worth it.</li>
    <li> My wife tried this for a week, and found nothing special about the product and got a pimple while using it, but the real problems came when we went to return it as we had bought it at a mall kiosk, and the salesperson had said there was a 30 day return policy if we were dissatisfied, but now they say the policy only allows for exchange for another Oro Gold product, so if we are not finding any satisfaction there is no money back guarantee.  Don&#x27;t believe the lies.</li>
    <li> I ordered the oro gold deep peel from the express factory and had it my doorstep within a couple of days.  This is one of the best products I have ever tried.  I have used many expensive products without the amazing results.  The older we get, the longer it takes for our skin to sulfa off.  Oro gold deep peel is gentle yet extremely effective...and it only takes a couple of minutes.</li>
    <li> My family and I were walking out of a mall and was stopped by a kiosk sales person. He asked me for two seconds of my time, and I couldn&#x27;t say no. He made me try the face peel on my wrist, and the body scrub on my hands, and I was amazed. He sold the body scrub, moisterizer, face peel, the moisterizer for the face, and the nail kit all for $179. I thought that was kind of pricy but when he took the time to actually show me that it works, it amazed me. I continue to use it and I am still amazed at how soft my hands are just from the first demonstration, and it is 3 days later.</li>
    <li> Oiginal purchased this product at retail.  Love the feel of my skin after using it but price was prohibited.  Now can use weekly at w reasonable price buying thru Amazon</li>
    <li> This is the first time for me to use peeling cream. At first I was nervous... As soon as I massaged my face with the peeling cream, something appeared. Then I noticed it was my dead skin...a lot.  I was scared...\\&quot;wow! my face skin is melting! It is damaged!\\&quot;. I washed my face with water again and again and ran to apply toner and moisturize cream on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now enjoy using Oro Gold 24K Deep Peeling twice a week. My face skin is smoother than bofore. I have not had any problem with this. Phew!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to continue to use this, so I made a second order today....</li>
    <li> I too was \\&quot;reeled in\\&quot; at the mall.  I bought this product hoping it would reduce the dark spots on my face.  I began working the stuff into my cheeks and the little balls of exfoliated skin it produced stuck to the peach fuzz on my face.  I tried to get it off with warm soap and water, then I tried lotion but nothing worked.  I finally had to pull the hair off with the balls.  I couldnt get them all.  Two days later some were still there.  I feel like a fool for not checking reviews before purchasing.  there are better products for your face.  Principle secret is who I am going back to.</li>
    <li> I can only speak for the orogold salon/store in Santa Barbara. It&#x27;s a complete scam! You are lured into the store and they massage a peeling into the skin and claims the little balls/granulates or dirt from your skin. This if followed by a moisturizer of which is massaged into the clean arm vs a &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; arm, the amount of cream used on each arm is far from the same and they claim the cream only absorbed if the skin has been cleaned first. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> This makes your face and hands feel so smooth and soft. I have been using it for many years. It is very pricy but one jar lasts several years. You use it on your face and I swear your winkles smooth out and your skin is so soft. It is the best product out there. I have tried so many other ones and I keep coming back to this brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the great reviews. However, I used it as instructed and it has no effect as claimed. It does not cleanse my face, doses not polish and does not peel any dead skin. I am totally shocked that this may be a fraud. I went back and clicked on all the reviews and realized that most of the reviewers only reviewed this product. I requested a refund, but the seller replied that becuase I have used the produce that they would not give me a refund. I am really disappointed that I can no longer trust the reviews on Amazon.com. I think Amazon.com should investigate whether this vendor write their own reveiws.    Now in Oct 2014, I finally figured out a home made recipe to get rid of old skin. N A cysteine(Lef.org, as the powder is very fine that can dissolve in water completely), vitamin C powder, sea salt in some water. It peeled like cracy the first two weeks. I then add some astaxanthin which also fades dark spot. Add some Vit E and CoQ10, lecithin and some essential oils will also help skin cell regeneration. Mix enough for one week in a small cup and refrigerate.</li>
    <li> I am a 53 year old women who is not always crazy about what I see in the mirror.  I use Bobbi Brown makeup and love it, but I have to admit there is nothing in that line of products or any other I have tried that equals this one.  Put very little of the peeling gel on your face, just enough to dampen your face and let it set for about 30 seconds. Then start buffing your face.  I rub fairly hard in a fast, short back and forth buffing motion.  You will feel like the product has dried up, but that is when the skin starts to role off so keep rubbing.  All you have to do is stand over a white sink and you will see all the dead rolled up skin laying in the sink.  I also use this product under my eyes right up to my eyelashes tip and bottom, but just don&#x27;t rub quite as hard. As soon as you wash it off, you WILL feel and see the difference instantly.  Can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this amazing product, my face has never felt and looked so smooth.  Follow up with a good moisturizer and the next day when you put your makeup on, you will be shocked how much easier your makeup goes on and how different your skin looks.  Don&#x27;t get carried away because of the great results, just use it twice a week. I also LOVE the Collegan and Seaweed Mask. My daughter who is 25 is also now hooked on these products!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for myself for Christmas. When removing it with a cotton square, no dear skin or dirt was removed. Then I felt my face, and all of my peachfuzz was twisted in tiny little knots. I couldn&#x27;t get them off with a buf-puf or scrub, so I hope they will go away on their own. NOT recommended if you have ANY fuzz on your face.</li>
    <li> This is so cool! as soon as you put it on and start massaging the face, you can feel all the dead skin roll off.  It&#x27;s a little freaky at first and I don&#x27;t keep it on for too long, but you can really tell the difference.</li>
    <li> Works works works.  My skin feels so clean and smooth after using it.  This is my second jar.</li>
    <li> Someone on here said the product does not actually remove dead skin.  I know for a fact it DOES!  I&#x27;ve had the VIPeel only available through an aesthetician and this product rivals the effect of that peel, but without the weeklong redness and peeling process.  My only mistake is i got a little overexcited about the process and used it on my jawline.  Unfortunately, it overpeeled and left me with unsightly raw skin on my jawline.  So, YES, its definitely peeling your skin.  The gel is just not coagulating to appear as if you are peeling or my jawline would not be raw.  I still give this product 5 stars because, in their defense, i didnt use the product as instructed.  I was so excited by the results, i used it every day instead of once per week as instructed.  I also didnt consider that the jawline does not receive as much sun damage as the rest of your face.  But, my jawline healed just fine and now that i use it as directed, i am VERY impressed.  Getting a normal chemical peel makes you look sunburned and you cannot wear makeup for a week.  This, you use once per week, and get the same results with no &#x27;downtime&#x27; or embarassing redness or continuous peeling for a whole week.</li>
    <li> Words can not describe how profound the results are from this product.  I just used it for the first time and my dead skin just rolled right off.  Then I followed it with vitamin C powder mixed with green tea , and then added my moisturizer and the more dead skin just rolled off my face leaving my skin smoother than a brand new baby&#x27;s.  I can hardly believe it.  I am 53 years young and have neglected my skin and have used everything natural i could possibly try and this product is the best.  I want to tell the world about it. I wish I had enough money to buy this for all my friends and family.  This is the best spend money.  I can not rave enough about this. I am so blown away at how soft my face is.  I am so excited I do not know if I will be able to sleep.  I am so happy and so grateful for this product. Feel free to contact me if anyone wants to.  My name is Rhonda. heartstorms@gmail.com.</li>
    <li> Like many others I was sold this product by a very effective salesman at a mall (I&#x27;m a salesman and love a good pitch!).  I am 52 and highly skeptical of most skin care products because they simply don&#x27;t work.  With buyer&#x27;s remorse and much trepidation I went home that night and used this peel on my face, neck and chest.  There are lots of products that make your skin feel great...for about ten minutes.  Then you wake up in the morning and it is if you washed with soap, applied Jergen&#x27;s and had most of it end up on your pillow case. Yet when I woke, the first thing I noticed was how smooth my face felt.  But the real surprise was what had happened to my chest!  I had had the beginnings of some pretty significant wrinkles above my cleavage.  They were 100% gone!  As the weeks went by, I noticed not only the wonderful feeling of smiling without feeling any tightness, but the pores I used to fill with silicone were virtually non-existent.  The deepening wrinkles around my mouth has lessened to only one scar from childhood.  Even the road map of wrinkles around my eyes have diminished to only one major laugh line.  I can&#x27;t believe something actually worked on this old face of mine.  After dumping literally thousands into laser treatments I feel like a fool.  Do not hesitate to buy this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a scam, I was tricked into buying their line...I walked out of the store having spent well per $600 dollars.  Mind you, the salesperson went on and on about how it was an investment and how it would be the only product that I would need to help me with my skin problems.  I have very sensitive skin and have suffered even as an adult with acne.  This is all a lie, I went to Ulta after months of horrible skin problems, it felt like my acne got worse.  Please do not buy this product, or any from this company, they are misleading and when I tried to reach out to them they turned me away.  Well, I used up everything in hopes that maybe it was my skin getting used to it, and with no avail my skin only started clearing up with a mud mask I purchased at Ulta.  Stay away from these people.</li>
    <li> They conned £200.00 out of me and I am a counsellor , so I should have known better . I had a reaction too . When I came home and started to cleanse my face ( wiith my &#x27;  natural &#x27; cleanser - one that I have used for two years without issues ) I experienced a burning tingling sensation which would not go away for some time . Luckily no scarring .</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product . I saw oro gold products for the first time at south coast plaza , CA..... they were selling them for hundreds of dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has better pricing..you must buy the  Oro Gold Bionic Thermal Mask, 2-Ounce (which you can use once a month, and it will last a year )and is sold for 400 $ ELSEWHERE ,BUT AT Amazon its for less than a 100$ , and you must also buy \\&quot;Oro Gold 24K Gold Deep peeling ( to be used twice a month)\\&quot;, Both products are five star.&lt;br /&gt;No need to go to expensive salons and spend a lot of money.... you will have better results by using these two products at home.... BELIEVE ME</li>
    <li> Although the price was too high for the products i bought, i do enjoy the result very much. Never had the chance to get results like that.</li>
    <li> I was passing the Santa Barbara Oro Gold store in Paseo Nuevo last week since the Lush store is right next door and I was heading back to the bus stop from Lush (Lush makes wonderful skincare products at a fraction of the Oro Gold price, btw. I use almost nothing else on my skin and hair). A very pushy man outside the store put a sample in one of my hands and then grabbed my other hand and said &amp;#34;I have something to show you.&amp;#34; It was all over for me at that point--I judge people by their ability to respect boundaries. The product could have made me look 10 years younger and I would not have bought it for any price after the salesmen grabbed my hand without asking. I humored his slimy, ridiculous sales pitch and laughed in his face when he told me the price of the mediocre at best products after he slathered some of the noxious stuff on my forearms, and I asked him how he expected a graduate student to pay that price. He said &amp;#34;not a problem, for you, I will give you a discounted price.&amp;#34; After 10 minutes of his pushy/bullying tactics and punching numbers in the register and a calculator (trying to find a price that could have been my &amp;#34;tipping point&amp;#34; I suppose), I said I had to go and walked as fast as my legs would carry me. I luckily got out of the store without buying anything. I am NEVER going to walk in front of an Oro Gold store again in life, and I encourage everyone else to avoid this terrible, overpriced product and the rude human beings that push this crap.</li>
    <li> This product feels like dead skin is coming off but instead it&#x27;s some sharp particles in the product that stick to your face for days and doesn&#x27;t come off even with scrubbing with a washcloth or using creams and oils. It is real junk.</li>
    <li> I am at Hawaii while writing this review.  Just like many other reviewers, I got into this scam trap but I survived. The store in Hawaii Hilton Village is beautiful and elegant.  I got drawn to the store and 3 sales people allured me further.  Once of them gave a free sachet sample of a peel. Another asked me to step inside and said I can try another very good sample. When I stepped inside the store, he said today is your lucky day since our promotions end today and the kit I am showing to you is my last kit.  He said people had been lining up to buy this kit and the store has been very busy. This caught my attention with caution since I passed by the store a few times while going to the adjacent ABC store.  Every time I passed by, there was nobody there in the store. Now, the sales man applied the peel on my wrist.  And, wow I was impressed to see some white solids coming out of the lotion he applied. I thought since I had so much of ocean activity, it is the burnt skin peeling off.  He also said that it takes care of rosacea of face. He applied some peel on one of my cheeks. Again something came off after he rubbed the solution on my cheek. But I immediately understood- it cannot peel off the skin so fast and it cannot be the miracle treatment.  And, I was right.  The sales person was trying to pitch me the product very hard. He said the peel itself was for $299 but since I am so good looking and today is my lucky day and he likes my skin etc.etc. he will give me 2 products for $299. By this time, I was getting irritated by his false statements of appreciation and I declined to buy.  Immediately he  added another small tube to the package. He scratched a card and added another piece of discount. When I declined he started saying that a pretty person like me should not think of money and buy good products like OroGold etc.  Then he added a big tube of body mist and then he added another box of Gold peel.  So instead of giving me one product in $299, now he was trying hard to sell me 5 products for $299. Obviously I did not buy any thing, thanks God, I resisted the temptation. I told the sales person that I want to see how it suits my skin and then I will come int he morning, if I feel it suitable for my skin type. And, immediately he got very upset that I did not buy any thing and that I am a miser etc...&lt;br /&gt;I came to my hotel room and saw that my cheek where he applied the product had turned red and had bumps as a reaction to this product already.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to warn customers not to fall into the sales tricks of this this product. Just like other reviewers said, the sales team is trained to sell you off very quickly without giving you time to think. They are very aggressive. Please do apply your common sense and trust them only after verification of the product- how does it feel, price, sales gimmicks etc.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I did not waste my money. I thank the reviewers for sharing their stories. After I read them, many of them resonated my experience.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Sueng hard to sell me 5 products for $299. Obviously I did not buy any thing, thanks God, I resisted the temptation.

    <li> My experience with an Oro Gold store was identical to that of KLPS.  Everything was scripted right down to the personal questions I was asked and the eye serum demonstration versus the handing over of a free sample.  My salesman was from Italy, or so he claimed, and gave a really hard sell.  The store was hot and I just could not get him to stop talking.  He never came up for air.  He first tried to sell me 2 eye products totally $500.00.  I told him that was ridiculous so he then tried some sort of body smoothing product on my wrist.  He compared the treated wrist with the untreated one, and I admit I saw a significant difference in the color between the two.  That alone made me tempted to buy some.  He then told me that he could give me the eye treatments and the cleansing whatever for $400.00.  Something in me said, do not buy from this guy.  I finally stood up and said, I cannot make any decisions right now.  What I primarily wanted to do was to see how long it took for both of my wrists to be the same colour again.  So I just got up and told him I was leaving.  He followed me to the door, still talking, and I practically ran to the parking garage.  Not surprisingly, the wrists were the same colour again after about 15 minutes.  And my puffy eyes were still puffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone:  DO NOT BE SEDUCED BY THIS PRODUCT INTO THINKING IT WILL HELP YOU GET A FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH.</li>
    <li> I got sucked into a store for a free sample. Very high pressure sales. Kept lowering the price everytime i tried to walk out the store. The sample they put on my daughters hand turned into a rash. I would not recomend this product.</li>
    <li> Very pushy salesmen!!! I felt bullied and being a bit shy I bought in order to escape the two salesman aggressively tag teaming me. Will NEVER allow myself be treated like that again. Boycott this product. Can&#x27;t say I see any results from what I bought. They start at a ridiculously high price and drop it and push tell your exhausted.</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst peeling product I have ever experienced. I bought it in a brand store in London. When I used it at home, it formed little sticky grains that couldn&#x27;t be washed off my facial skin neither with water nor with cleanser. Even by intensive rubbing it was hard to get the product off, some of it stayed on.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service told me that \\&quot;the product will fall off after some time\\&quot; and I \\&quot;should not worry\\&quot;. When I wanted my money back or at least another product in exchange, they wrote \\&quot;they understand my frustration\\&quot; but can&#x27;t help me.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  Set aside for a minute (if you can) the crazy pressure sales tactics, the lies about the product being returnable, etc.  I just tried this product and my face is now A MESS.  I am not sure what it does or did, but my skin is now a red, splotchy, itchy mess after using this product just once.  It appears to have caused the little peachfuzz hairs on my face (hairs I have never even noticed before, mind you) to twist together, and has caused my skin to peel - not in a good exfoliating kind of way - but rather in an injured-looking, raw, super problematic kind of way.  I don&#x27;t think I have ever reviewed anything on amazon before (although i buy EVERYTHING on amazon), but this product is soooooooooooo bad that I felt inclined to sign on and review it right away.  Seriously, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> I found this to be very mild and non irritating. I have very sensitive skin and have found the ORO Gold line in general to be great for me.  BTW: I see there are a lot of bad reviews about selling practices and so forth, but I&#x27;m not commenting on that since I bought all my stuff here on Amazon. So, I&#x27;ll just speak about the product itself, which I believe is what these reviews are for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I was a little skeptical if this was really taking off the dead skin. But, when I had a bad sunburn that left me with dead skin all over my face, I decided to try this out to see if it would help to get rid of it. It worked great. My face didn&#x27;t burn or hurt after using the peel, and in the tender state my skin was in with it being burned, I thought it might. It actually took off a lot of the dead skin like it was supposed to. But, it didn&#x27;t leave my skin overly stretched or dry. Which it never does anyway, and that&#x27;s one of the main reasons I use this as my primary peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about two years now. I got it for an incredible price on Amazon at around Christmas time two years ago and ended up buying it in bulk. Although, now I see it&#x27;s gone up a lot. So, I&#x27;m not looking forward to purchasing it for that kind of money, but I certainly will since it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a mild peel that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin too dry or irritated, this may be a good option. I have really sensitive skin and can use it without any water on my face prior to application. It doesn&#x27;t hurt or sting. It has worked for me personally and I would definitely recommend. FYI: I do get asked what I use for my face, which I find to be a flattering compliment at my age. And I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s all genetic, because the wrinkles have been much less since using this line of product. It may be a coincidence, but I doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I will admit their sales tactics are tacky and their products are way overpriced. But both the peeling exfoliant and the day cream work great and I have very sensitive skin. The only thing I can think of with the bad ratings are people didn&#x27;t use enough of the product because they were being cheap. I only bought the one peel and was given 10 samples of the cream which should last a while...even with the \\&quot;discounts\\&quot; it&#x27;s still my most outrageous skin care purchase to date, but I am very satisfied with the chemical peel and when I&#x27;m done using it I actually have dead skin all over the shirt I&#x27;m wearing. Use your hands when applying this, don&#x27;t apply with a pad, it will just eat up your product and not work as efficiently...saw a couple of reviews doing that. Until I can find another chemical peel that produces the same results, I can&#x27;t give this product a bad rating, even for the price.</li>
    <li> The sales tactics are pushy and I&#x27;m a pushover. I would say it doesn&#x27;t do exactly what it promises and doesn&#x27;t peel a layer of skin. However, I will say that whatever is in there, makes my skin feel a little softer. So, although it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to, I don&#x27;t feel like a total jerk for spending so much money on such a useless product.</li>
    <li> Hard sell sales people dragging you off the street. Rub something on your hand which makes it look amazing but then most creams do when first applied. It was supposedly the exfoliator followed by moisturiser. I said no, was then offered half price for damaged box...fortunately i am not gullible and don&#x27;t trust easily so I left with the sales person trying to drag me to another part of the salon out of the way of earshot for other people. hand felt amazing rest of day but next day was like sandpaper. So glad I wasn&#x27;t conned. Even more worrying is that this product was intended for my face.</li>
    <li> This is one of the least effective products I have ever used The packaging falls apart within a few days.  The sales men are very aggressive.  I would never recommend this product or use it again.  It&#x27;s very pricy and useless.</li>
    <li> Oh my God, what sort of joke was that? Well, like the other reviewers I&#x60;ve been pulled in to the shop with the promise of giving me a new face ;) The consultant was very friendly and convincing. I had no idea what this guy wanted to really do with me. Initially I&#x60;ve been told that I am so handsome and where I bought my clothes from, blabla and my face looks fine except that I need few cosmetics from them ;) He started showing me their catalogue (you will not find this anywhere) with the products starting from £100 and finishing £1500. He than showed to me the other catalogue (can&#x60;t remember the name but this one would be also very difficult to find;  I couldn&#x60;t find it even on their official website - Press zone) with the pictures of the famous stairs such as Madonna that supposedly uses Oro Gold. Finally he started to apply a lot of different products on my hands and face. I thought - god they are so expensive - why is he putting so much of this on a such small surface and than he&#x60;s wiping off over 80% of this? ..and like a pedlar trying to sell the s*** wrapped in a golden paper he started to ask about my girlfriend and if I could show the picture of her so he could based on that suggest the best products for her - what a crap?! I just couldn&#x60;t feel that I am on good hands in a professional beauty salon (like Channel or Lancome). All I could feel was a scam. Why those representatives are pursuing people on the street being insistent and forcing them to buy those \\&quot;top products widely used by pop stairs\\&quot;? Have you even seen Channel or Vichy high street representatives sneaking at 8:30pm like those Orogold stealthy sellers? Bad experience. ..and because of the way they&#x60;re promoting their cosmetics - suspicious and intrusive I just don&#x60;t care how good or bad that cosmetics are - I am not gonna buy them! Beware. Oro Gold violate the OFT rules! Read</li>
    <li> These guys use high pressure sales tactics that left me feeling conned and angry. I can&#x27;t believe I fell for it! Also, doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all. Does absolutely nothing except leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> It is scam! The product is absolutely do nothing! I hope I can give a zero star.</li>
    <li> I was a victim of consumer fraud at the newly opened Orogold store in the Gardenstate Plaza mall in Paramus, NJ. Although I have now disputed the charges with my credit card, I want the warning to go out there to all consumers in New Jersey and all around the country to avoid this compamy at all costs! They are a bunch of slick con artists who have absolutely no regard for doing business in a legal or ethical way. Last week., I was at the mall buying something I had planned on getting for my upcoming birthday and I was in a relaxed and unguarded mood when I was approached by this man with an accent. He spoke to me as if he was my friend which I did not buy into but my defenses were down and I agreed to let him apply eye serum to my one eye. He went into his whole schpiel and even though I kept saying no, he kept saying how the product was not that expensive considering it would last for 2 years. I hesitated and he then asked me if I was a nurse.I said no and he looked at me knowingly and said, “Answer me again. Are you a nurse?” I said no again and he shook his head and said, “Come on. Are you a nurse?” So I kind of laughed and said yes because obviously he wanted me to play along. Then the product was 1/2 priced. So I agree to give it a try, thinking that I had gotten a decent price even though it was still kind of pricey. Then he was continuing to chat me up and saying I should come into their newly opened store so he could give me some more samples. So I reluctantly followed him into the store. There he had me sit and he examined my face very closely. He offered me first some water and then shook his head and suggested champagne since it was my birthday month. I laughed nervously and shrugged. He then gave me another schpiel how he was going to apply treatment to half of my face so I could see how well their other products work. I protested that I defintely could not spend any more money that day. He shushed me and started applying treatment to the rightside of my face. At tis point, I was a little worried because I had an appointment in an hour and I wanted to get a bite to eat before I went. But he had already applied things to my face and had put a glass of champagne in my hand. Then he whisked me to the back, saying it was free there now and I could lay on the table and relax for a few minutes while the mask on my face did its magic. He then talked of Denise Richards who endorses them and said Dr. Oz recommends their products (an out and out lie). All the while still talking to me as if I was a long time friend. When he took the treatment off my face, he gave me a mirror and was positively glowing about how incredibly better the right side of my face looked than the left! My head was a little light from the champagne since I had not yet had lunch and I agreed with him because it did look better. Then he told me the price of the package he put on me and my jaw dropped. No, I can’t! He protested, did I not like the product. I said I liked it just fine but I had to go and I couldn’t afford to spend that kind of money. He was then going, “What would you rate it?” I said, “Maybe an 8″ because at that moment I was impressed. He insisted hat he really wanted me to use their product so he would bring down the price and he proceeded to cut the price in half. It was still too steep and I said no. Then he whispered in my ear, “I’m not supposed to do this but I really like you and I want you to use our product because I know you will have good results and you will tell all your friends. But please do not tell anyone you got it for this price.” He then took a card and scanned it thru the machine and claimed it was his employee card for an employee discount. The price was now about 1/3. He then said he would minus the price I had already paid for the eye treatments I had already purchased. It was still too much money. but I was late and now I was a little torn. I thought to myself, “Maybe I’ll take it home and think about it. I could always return it.” Those were the thoughts in my head so I agreed and he took my card. My heart was thumping because I had just spent $1000 on skin products. Yes, maybe it was for 1 year or more but still, it was alot of money. Already I was starting to feel some buyers remorse but I was in a rush and after posing for a picture with them, feeling like I was in shock, I left.&lt;br /&gt;When I got home later after my acupuncture appointment, I took out my purchase. Then I examined the receipt. I saw that it said “No Returns. Exchange in 14 days”. My heart dropped. He had never mentioned this no return policy to me once! Feeling depressed, I went online and googled Orogold. Behold the first suggested search was “Orogold scam!” My heart dropped more. I searched for a review and the first onethat popped up was, “Beward of Orogold”. And I kept seeing post after post of complaints about Orogold from all around the globe from the US to Canada to England to Sweden to the Philipines. Feeling depressed with being stuck with unaffordable skin care products I decided to open the treatment ad treat the other half of my face to see if I could see a dramatic change like they showed in the store. Guess what? There was no dramatic change and then it occured to me. They had tricked me. Everyone had one side of the face that is better than the other. The left side sees more sun if you drive so the right side is the better, less sun damaged side and thus has fewer blemishes or fine lines. The skin also looks brighter on that side. I was busy with other things too and I tried to go about my day while I also stressed about how I was going to pay off $1000 without my husband noticing since I did not want to upset him with the stupid mistake I had made.&lt;br /&gt;But after pondering all the hundreds of stories and complaints from all over the globe about Oro-gold, I thought to myself that this could not possibly be legal! So I looked up NJ consumer protection laws and sure enough I found that I had been a clear victim of consumer fraud since they had misrepresented their prices, deceived me about the product and concealed the material fact that the products were non-refundable. I was in the right and they were in the wrong. I called my credit card company and they suggested I go back to them and give them a chance to make it right. So I did along with my friend who came for moral support. The moment they saw that I was upset with them they started acting like they were the victims and did not understand why I was so angry. I informed them that they had broken consumer laws and that I wanted to speak with their manager. The told me that was not possible because he was out of town. How convenient! They then kicked my girlfriend out of the store because she was trying to video the proceedings. THey then tried to reason with me but I stood my ground and threatened legal action. THey then threatened to call security. I am a petite Asian woman. Maybe they thought they could intimidate me since my friend was no longer in the store. I said, “Go ahead. You’re the ones who broke the law.” At which point, a customer slipped out of the store. They then changed their tack and said that they really wished to help me but could not do so themselves. I needed to call an 877 number, a number I had called the day befrore and gotten an automated message telling me to leave my name and number and that I would get a callback which never came! They promised me that this time the call would come.So I called and left a message demanding my money back in their presence.&lt;br /&gt;I then left the store, upset and shaking but I had held myself together because there was no way I was going to cry in front of them. I walked away a bit with my girlfriend who was trying to calm me down and we called my credit card company to dispute the charge. This is when I burst into tears. I have never felt so victimized in my life. How do people just blatantly flaunt the law and then when faced with the consequences, behave the way they do. The credit card company informed me that since I had already given the merchant a chance that they would fight for me. I told them that these people must not get my money because they are a bunch of crooks. After I had calmed down, I also reported this incident to mall management. Mall Management was sympathetic but confessed they could not do much more than have mall security keep an eye on them. Why would they toleate a tenant that is committing consumer fraud? This is a lawsuit waiting to happen.&lt;br /&gt;I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and will report them to the Division of Consumer Affairs in NJ. I also plan to post anywhere and everywhere I can on the internet about what a shady bunch of scam artists they are. I feel foolish to have been conned this way. I will never again speak to anyone who tries approach me with any kinds of products in the mall. What they are doing is wrong and illegal and consumers need to be warned about Oro-Gold. Hopefully they will get kicked out of the mall. Of Their products are that great, why would they be breaking the law to sell them?!</li>
    <li> They rip you off. They use very aggressive sales techniques and push you to buy dropping the prices ridiculously. You feel awful after buying what you really didn&#x27;t want to buy.</li>
    <li> I bought oro gold facial peel at the mall until I googled the active ingredient and found out that amazon is selling a very similar product sold as &amp;#34;Vivo Per Lei Facial Peel&amp;#34; for $8! Once I found that I started buying multiples because I love what the product (essentially a chemical exfoliant) does for my skin but just hate the price.  Actually there are a lot of products out there that do the same peeling action as this one, for a lot less. the &amp;#34;Cure&amp;#34; product that is super popular in Japan is one of them. $28 for 8 oz on Amazon at the moment.  I&#x27;m trying out Mizon&#x27;s apple peeling gel which is 4 oz for $10.50 on Amazon right now.  I&#x27;m grateful that I was turned onto this stuff by the mall kiosk but now I realize there&#x27;s a world of skin care products out there and I have just barely scratched the surface.</li>
    <li> Today I was introduced to this product in store and ended up purchasing two items on discount. After doing research, the price that I was originally told for the product (prior to discount) was consistent with what is advertised online. Thus far the product has worked well for me and I am happy with it. Granted, it seems a bit expensive, but as I am obtaining the results I was told I would receive I see it as an investment in nice, healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I find the numerous individuals complaining about how they were &amp;#34;forced&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;scammed&amp;#34; into purchasing the product to be rather irritating. Unless the sales people physically took ones credit card, debit card, or cash, or physically restrained said individual so that he/she could not leave the store (all of which would obviously be illegal) then they were NOT forced - it was a choice. One may have felt pressured to purchase, but that&#x27;s another matter; the option to walk away and say no still existed. It is silly to bash the product simply because one might feel silly about being convinced to spend money on a product that they didn&#x27;t want, but that in my experience, does work as it claims to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this appears thus far to be a good quality product that works as it claims to.</li>
    <li> It makes your skin soft and shiny . Feels clean . I just used it for two days and I&#x27;m very happy about the change . Maybe the sellers are very pushy and annoying ,which they are by the way, but I love the product , five star maybe a bit too high , hope I don&#x27;t have to come back yo change it</li>
    <li> --My wife has A-TOPIC DERMATITUS on her face, arms, neck and chest. THIS PRODUCT (the real product) WORKS. Her skin went from snake skin peeling (no joke) to young and supple (age 22) in hours. One application of the 24k Deep Peeling scrub and 2 applications of the 24k Multi-vitamin Day Moisturizer (read 2 days) on the third day, she was AND STILL IS PAIN AND FLAKE FREE. Doctors gave a young woman a STEROID CREAM to continue to use FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. Now, I am for equality and all that, BUT, I prefer my lady to not have to SHAVE HER FACE! Or have a voice TONE deeper than mine. That&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;  The store offers MONTHLY FREE FACIALS for ONE YEAR (read 12) with their 24k Vitamin C Booster Facial Serum, the 24k Vitamin C Facial Cleanser and the 24k Vitamin C Mask. How much is that worth to you ladies? Now, please understand, different stores have different policies, I am sure, but you can always ASK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Yes the product IS expensive. IT HAS GOLD IN IT! IT WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-BEWARE OF POSERS:&lt;br /&gt;Understand there are other companies selling a product NOTHING LIKE Oro Gold. Same name, and in places like LAS VEGAS, where there are NO REPEAT customers, companies purchase the Oro Gold stores. They sell crap products with a similar style and name. Same goes for online purchases, even here on Amazon. If you see a $179.00 product for $15.00 you better think, hum, am I about to get screwed on this product? Cosmetics are HIGHLY competitive. Oro gold has a website ([...] please use it to research before you put something on YOUR FACE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Sales Tactics:&lt;br /&gt;The people employed by Oro Gold (read Israeli company) are foreigners. They make commission. They are taught FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE to SELL OR STARVE. Understand most Americans are not used to these tactics (read supposed HIGH pressure sales); HOWEVER, believe me (world traveler) when I tell you these sales are nothing compared to what is over seas. Oh, by the way, Israeli&#x27;s may be pushy and theirproducts expensive, BUT THEY ALWAYS SELL GOOD PRODUCT. (that is where the money is)</li>
    <li> With gentle circular motions, this product will cause your old dead skin cells to \\&quot;ball up.\\&quot;  I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time tonight and let me tell you, this is AMAZING! I have been plagued with clogged pores (ie. blackheads) since my deployment to Iraq...this cleaned out all of my pores (okay, realistically, not ALL, but most of them)! I spread it on my dry face, let it sit for about a minute, and then rubbed it (in circular motions) off with my fingertips. I have never seen something work this well on my face, even the chemical peels I&#x27;ve received in the spa. I recommend to anyone dealing with acne!</li>
    <li> I Have never had a facial or been to the spa and with this product who needs to. You can see the gold leaves in it and the dead skin cells u can also see, after using my skin feels like never before silky smooth ultra soft and clean i can feel my pores open and then close once rinsed amazing. 5 stars from me a must have u want truly clean skin water is thing i the past thanks to Oro Gold Cosmetics and of course Amazon.</li>
    <li> I got suckered into an orogold store while shopping at a mall.  These sales associates are on u like cat on meat and really do kill u with your kindness.  The sales rep demonstrated an exfoliating gel with a $$$ digit price tag... This gel is nothing special compared to what asian skincare products have to offer and for a fraction of the cost--which I explained to her that theres an Asian exfoliating gel product very similar but is all natural that I own and am not interested.  She went on to blab about how the product is a one of kind because of its special &#x27;gold&#x27; properties.  Bishh please it better be made of gold for that price!  I feel like thats their only selling point, to justify the price tag that you&#x27;re slathering on gold dust onto your face hence why we can charge this much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, be sure to look at the manufacturing label, because I sure did.. This product is &#x27;Made in Korea&#x27; . LMAO.&lt;br /&gt;The Asian skincare product that I own and will give u the same results.. minus the high price tag is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;CURE Natural Aqua Gel&#x27;  does the exact same damn thing as this and u can find it on amazon for like $40.  In my opinion the gel formulations are the exact same and both come from Asia. If you prefer a formulation with &#x27;GOLD&#x27; sprinkles and have the disposable income for Orogold ---then be my guest.  But as for me, Im not a sucker and my products do work just fine.</li>
    <li> I was shopping in the Westfield San Fransicso shopping center today when I got pulled over by a sales associate from Orogold cosmetics, Mayan. She commented on my acne and how she used to have it (probably false) and pulled me into the back of the store. She applied a cream onto my hand and made me compare the two hands. The hand that got the cream applied to had a slightly better feel, but not very much. Then she applied some different creams onto my face. These did have an effect, but also a slight one. She promised me that this time the effect was not as clear since we did not apply it for the recommended amount of time. Being the stupid fool that I am and me being very sensitive about my acne, I believed her. She sold me two bottles, each worth $149.99 and apparently lasting for &amp;#34;2 years&amp;#34;. I was too engaged by the acne cream that I had no space to think that this was a scam. She also added an extra cream saying this was a &amp;#34;present&amp;#34; from her, which she probably did to all her customers. I made the purchase, but getting a suspicious feeling for the product, I checked amazon on my phone for the products. There it was, pages and pages of other customers like me who were scammed by this company. I read their reviews, and I got furious that a company can do this. The thing that made my jaw drop was that people were posting that the company does not accept refunds. I could not believe it, since I checked with the sales associate before my purchase and she did make it clear that I was able to get a refund if I did not like the product. However, I looked at the reciept and it said NO REFUND. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. This violated the cooling-off period, one of the consumer rights in the US. Infuriated, I walked back into the store and demanded a refund. The regional manager came out, and he just kept on rambling about how ignorant the scams were on amazon and how their products were the best in the market despite of all the negative reviews on amazon. Finally, after 30 minutes of listening to his rant about the company and product he offered me to give me a half refund and me still keeping the product. I accepted the offer and walked out of the store this time with half a refund. However, I was not satisfied that for such a scam I was losing over $150 (full price was $326.23 for the two year supply) so I walked back into the store and demanded a full refund. This time, the store owner came out. He was more responsible than the regional manager and asked me less questions. He allowed me to return the product and get the full refund (the other half of the refund) back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL:DR, DO NOT BUY. IF YOU DO BUY, ANNOY THEM TO GIVE YOU A FULL REFUND. DO NOT SETTLE FOR THE HALF REFUND.</li>
    <li> Our skin&#x27;s best friends are our genetics, sun protection, proper diet, and for damaged skin, our dermatologist. Over-the-counter products are a temporary aid at best, and this absurdly overpriced line that needs hawkers to sell it in malls is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, ladies, such companies prey upon our dismay at finding ourselves aging. Simply said, \\&quot;Run fast, run far!\\&quot; The product is of little use.</li>
    <li> I love the Oro Gold Deep Peeling. I bought my first at a county fair. You put on the gel and start rubbing and your dead skin just comes right off. You will feel is peeling away. I thought it couldn&#x27;t be my skin at first..that it was the gel coagulating in some way, but my skins ends up sooooo soft afterwards, really fresh feeling. Best peeling I&#x27;ve every tried!!</li>
    <li> this product is excellent.  I am very pleased with the quality and performance and also the price, definitely will re-order when used up and will also order the other items in the oro gold product line.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this from a Dead Sea beauty rep in the mall at Las Vegas.  LOVED it!  I have been using this for 3 weeks now and am still in aww every time I use it.  Since then have bought many other Oro Gold products as well online, love them all!</li>
    <li> Ordered this last week for 1/3 the price it is selling for today. What???    Anyway, the product is great. It really made a difference in my skin and I was amazed at how much dead skin came off, considering I use a daily scrub.     I may buy again, if the price comes back down.</li>
    <li> This is a nice peel.  It is gentle yet gets the job done.  It washes off easily and leaves the skin smooth and not red and irritated.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a year. This product is worth its weight in gold. The women on Waikiki who sold this to me were awesome and loaded on the discounts. I had never spent so much for any product in my life but I&#x27;m so glad I did. My skin is the best it&#x27;s even been. I can tell when my skin is very well exfoliated because it won&#x27;t ball up like it typically does. When my skin builds up a dead layer, this stuff takes it off big time. I use it once a week and haven&#x27;t run out yet. Be patient and keep it up. You&#x27;ll see the results. Ensure your face is completely clean dry before you use it. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll just be taking off old makeup and residue. Make sure to moisturize right after. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> They should take down of pic&#x27;s that you might ordered. I ordered the following cylinder of 24K gold deep peeling in a small round brown egg shell container, no it wasn&#x27;t what i ordered, they then told me that it&#x27;s old packing and the stuff they sent me was the same, Wrong! I&#x27;m smarter than that, I requested a return, they credited my cc. I just think if your selling iteams and showing the same box with the same solution is best for everyone. R.M</li>
    <li> Yep i was pulled into the store too and realized i am a complete pushover. I reallllllly regret paying as much as i did for it, even with the discount the sales associate gave me. The product does work, to an extent. I could have probably gotten something WAY cheaper that did the exact same job. I got the Deep Peel and the Night Cream for $144 annnnd yes, i regret it. I WISH i could return it, and I&#x27;m more upset with the fact that the sales associate was so enticing. She definitely did her job well.</li>
    <li> Nothing but an overpriced product.  I have used it for a month and it has done nothing dramatic for my skin that makes me go wow this is definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Beware of free gifts, ladies!  I went to grab the white plastic bag with the sample and go pulled into the store.  I was on vacation so I thought, why not.  As soon as I said no, the sales person started dropping the price.  I got a feeling like I was a car dealership negotiating the price of a car.  I bought the peel and the moisturizer for $75 each.  I also bought the eye serum for $120.  He included the gold mask and hand cream.  I asked about the return policy and he said I can return it if I don&#x27;t like it.  Later, I saw on the receipt that all sales are final but you can exchange it.  I tried the product after returning from my vacation.  I was ready to be disappointed and kiss my money goodbye.  I was surprised to find that I really like the peel.  It works great and leave my skin smooth and soft.  Unlike Clarisonic and other exfoliators, this doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to feel like I used sand paper on it.  Other peels make my skin turn red and sensitive.  I didn&#x27;t care much for the moisturizer.  I wished I had tried it first because I could not stand the smell of the stuff.  However, it peel works well with my L&#x27;Occitane Immortelle moisturize.  The verdict is still out on the eye serum.  I stopped by the Oro Gold store at the mall today and the lady said I can exchange it for something else.  She said they want to show me other products.  Now that I know what it is like, I know not to pay retail.  From the other posts, it looks like I can get it for less than 50%.  I want to keep buying this peel but I don&#x27;t have to go through bargaining process each time.  They should really think about lowering the price to be similar to other brand name skincare products and having major department stores carry their line.  A store like that in a mall isn&#x27;t cheap.  The profit margin must be pretty high to be able to employ these people and pay the rent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I have been using this product for about 9 weeks (once every 4 days).  It works better than all the peels I have tried.  The eye serum is okay and not worth the price.  I have used better products.  I like their C booster.  I was able to exchange my moisturizer at the local Orogold store in the mall for the C booster.  Of course the guy tried to push more products but I am wiser the second time around.  He wasn&#x27;t as pushy as the one in Waikiki.  He said it is because it is a local mall and they can&#x27;t stay in business if they upset everyone here.  Unlike Waikiki, many of the folks who shop here also live around here.I have tried.  The eye serum is okay and not worth the price.  I have used better products.  I like their C booster.

    <li> Ordered this because of the reviews, and this does work. Ordered it a second time and ordered two.  Don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
    <li> Oh, I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy after reading these reviews!  Same thing, on vacation in Hawaii, got puked into the store for&amp;#34; something for your eyes&amp;#34;.  The saleswoman was a stunning Spanish girl with a charming accent and flawless skin -- just like mine was when I was only 25!  She did the eye routine, &amp;#34;see the difference already?&amp;#34;, but I couldn&#x27;t and just said &amp;#34;mmmm&amp;#34;.  The price started at $500 for 2 products and kept dropping, until I finally said that I didn&#x27;t have my purse with me and &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll have to talk with my husband&amp;#34;.  Upstairs I asked him to see if there was any difference in my wrinkles under each eye --- no, of choose there wasn&#x27;t.  I currently use May Kay products, she said, &amp;#34;These don&#x27;t have all the chemicals that Mary Kay uses...&amp;#34; but when I compared the ingredients on the sample she gave me, most are the same with a few plant extracts thrown in.  JUST SAY NO!</li>
    <li> VERY EXPENSIVE AND DOES NOT LIVE UP TO THE HYPE THEY TELL YOU....BETTER OFF BUYING OVER THE COUNTER PRODUCTS !!!!! CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE WORST,</li>
    <li> I should have never been stopped by there place in the mall. Before I knew it this lady was putting products on my face and I was buying some of there expensive products. Not even a week after my use my face started peeling SUPER bad every where and I couldn&#x27;t move my face a lot bc of the dry and stiffness. And on top of that I couldn&#x27;t even wear makeup to cover the embarrassing dry skin. When I texted the assistant who got me to buy it she said it was because I didn&#x27;t have one of there products called the vitamins c booster. So she wanted me to BUY MORE of there products so it would go away. I was given five samples for a week and it slightly went down. But when I used a make up remover to take off make up because my skin was way too dry for make up, my skin got worse. SO NOT USE ANY OTHER PRODUCTS ON YOUR SKIN WHILE USING OROGOLD. It made my skin worse and it burned. After only 3 weeks of use I am discontinuing my use of the product.</li>
    <li> I was stopped at the mall by a sales associate, who at first tried to sell me the jar of the Deep Peeling for $150. In a few minutes, she said it was her first day and she can give me a special discount and I can get the cream free if I buy the Peeling. Seeing my hesitation, the price went down to $79 and I didn&#x27;t even need to buy two products. The final price was $59 for the jar.. It was still too high for me, since I knew absolutely nothing about the product. Reading the reviews, I think I was right notto purchase it..</li>
    <li> This is the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommend. Have been using this for years. Yes it works 100 percent. No I am not a sales rep.</li>
    <li> Shopping in Maui, I was practically grabbed by a man who ran the biggest scam I had ever seen!  First, he complimented my skin, &amp; kept touching my shoulder.  He was soooo annoying! Every time I would turn to get my husband&#x27;s attention, he would touch me.  He flat out wanted 400.00 &amp; he guaranteed the results of a face lift! He sadly was messing with the wrong Texas gal bc this lady LOVE$$$$$$ her money, &amp; we don&#x27;t part easily! He finally tired of me, &amp; let me free! I went to the hotel to search the reviews and was not surprised!  I would steer clear of these people!</li>
    <li> I was told this is plastic surgery without the surgery.  Well far from it.  After 3,000 dollars later and 7 months I see no difference.  The sales staff is well trained.  And every time you try to walk out the door they add a free gift or lower the price.  All very attempting.  And let&#x27;s face it who does not want a face lift without the surgery.  I did,  now I wish I would have gone for the Botox.  I try not to think about what I spent because it took me a long time to save that amount.  Oh well live and learn.</li>
    <li> I had initially hesitated from purchasing the product because of the price. But, the lady somehow managed to convince me with a free product demo. I suffer from oily and acne prone skin and my skin breaks out quite often as well. I was a bit apprehensive about applying the products on my skin, but when I saw the amount of dead skin it peels off, I start believing in the product. I purchased it and applied it in the coming weeks hoping to get better results. I was surprised when I started getting compliments about my complexion. This was a first for me and I was really pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dark spots had reduced as well and the skin felt so much softer and smoother. I now use the product once every week and I can manage to leave my house without foundations as well.</li>
    <li> fabulous product love it</li>
    <li> I am a first time user at Orogold Cosmetics, and let me tell you guys, contrary to all the reviews that I have seen here, this product is really cool. I have always suffered from clogged pores and my skin has looked really bad as a result. However, when I used the peel on my face, massaged it for 30 secs and washed it off, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. I have never seen a product create such a difference to my face in a single use. My face actually felt smoother and lighter. One of the best peels I have ever seen in my life. I think it was more effective than those chemical peels I got done at the spa. And they cost just about the same! Crazy!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear much makeup and I&#x27;m not the girlie girl who gets facials all the time or splurges on creams and product. I wear eyeliner, lipstick, some powder for shine and that is about it...not even spf moisturizer for my face most of the time. I tend to be running/swimming/etc and don&#x27;t have time for reapplying makeup. And most importantly I tend not to be a sucker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I met an aggressive salesperson and had a trial of the deep peeling treatment on my arm after he spouted some lines about sun damage and sweat and oils...but it seemed to work. I went home and tried it on my face and the results seem to work. Granted, I don&#x27;t shell out money on product and barely visit a cosmetic counter or Sephora  once every 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what was exfoliated, but my face feels super smooth and clean...so, something is working.</li>
    <li> Any group that uses such aggressive sales techniques to where you feel swindled and hate yourself for even letting yourself get dragged into their store, has to have MAJOR things wrong with it. Read the other reviews. I made it out of the store after getting dragged in, the sales lady pointed out my blackheads and said at 25 my body decided it&#x27;s had enough time being beautiful and that not it&#x27;s time to take care of myself. Sooo glad I didn&#x27;t but because the product feels like goop and the arm she put it on feels sticky. Be careful walking by them.</li>
    <li> Please forgive the length of this review but with this place, it is necessary.  I also want people to know there is return policy that I was able to utilize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RUN, do not walk, past this place.  In fact if you can avoid being anywhere near it, all the better.  I had never heard of these products or company before and I wish I had.  My experience was in the mall near my home which caters to a wealthier area in NY.  I am not wealthy but many people in the surrounding area are and I can totally see some of them totally falling for this.  They had an actual store there called \\&quot;Infinite Beauty\\&quot;.  I was in the midst of a busy day Christmas shopping and was walking toward my next destination when a man came up to me and handed me a sample of something.  I am always one to take a sample and move on which I was planning on doing when he said \\&quot;oh, let me give you the one for the eyes too\\&quot;.  This is where you need to say no thank you and keep going.  Thinking I was getting another small packet, I followed him toward the opening of the store and before I know it he is slathering stuff under my eyes.  I protested and said I had to keep going but now of course I have stuff on my face.  When he went to wipe it off, he actually then put stuff on another area of my face.  Of course he made the biggest reaction and said I had one of the best results ever.  Of course!  Let me say that I am 43 and people always think I am in my 30s.  I have good genes from my grandmother and mother when it comes to skin and I also take good care of it.  You would have thought otherwise the way this guy was talking to me.  I eventually got suckered into buying two products for the eyes for a ridiculous amount of money.  Totally my own fault, but when you are being barraged like this you honestly feel like the only way to get the heck out of there is to buy something.  Even after that he was following me and grabbed my hand and put some kind of charcoal mask on it before I could get out.  Now Iwas totally annoyed and kind of let him know.  Eventually I got out of there but am now annoyed and disgusted with myself for allowing myself to get suckered into this.  I left the mall and could not stop thinking about it that night.  So I went online and found all of this information about these products and how they are sold.  It is the exact same experience for everyone and made me very angry.  I checked the receipt and it said \\&quot;Refunds in 7 days, unopened products with original receipts\\&quot;.  So I decided I was going back there the next night after work even though I really didn&#x27;t want to make another trip to the mall.  I went back and the same guy and a colleague were perched outside waiting to assault a new person.  He saw me, I held up the bag and said I am back to return this.  He seemed a little surprised but turned me over right away to the \\&quot;manager\\&quot;.  Of course this guy tried to convince me to keep the products and starts telling me about other products to address my \\&quot;skin issues\\&quot;.  At this point I had enough and told him I didn&#x27;t want any of his deals or products, I just wanted my money back.  He kept trying to only refund me half the money and was extremely rude, asked me why I wasted their time and said that I shouldn&#x27;t buy things I don&#x27;t intend to use.  He asked me twice if I was married (same as the sales guy did) and he said what will you do in a couple of years get plastic surgery?  How insulting.  I don&#x27;t need it now and I certainly won&#x27;t need it in a \\&quot;couple of years\\&quot; either.  I told him I do not believe in plastic surgery and he said well without that or our products what will you do.  I said grow old gracefully and not go broke.  He practically threw the receipt at me and was again trying to lecture me when I cut him off and told him to have a good day and walked out.  These people are vultures and prey on women&#x27;s insecurities.  They will ask you what you don&#x27;t like about yourself and then show you a miracle product for that issue.  I am not even saying these might not be good products but they are extremely overpriced and the whole sales style is a turnoff.  When I said I didn&#x27;t like the light sun spots I had on my cheeks (which are not noticeable to anyone but me) he showed me a mask that of course had to be followed by a serum and they were $599 each.  Ridiculous.  Warn your friends &amp; neighbors!</li>
    <li> STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE THEY ARE TERRIBLE! I turned my back at the mall and they took advantage of my poor elderly mother and pushed all these expensive products on her! We hadn&#x27;t even left the mall when I discovered what had happened and brought her back to the store. She has debt problems because this has happened to her before. I tried to explain the situation to them and beg them to give her a refund and they flat refused! They kept pointing to the thing on the sign that said no refunds and talked about how they didn&#x27;t have the power to authorize a refund (even though they &amp;#34;had the power&amp;#34; to give her a &amp;#34;$178 discount&amp;#34;). I was so angry I wanted to cry right there in the store! They had no remorse for what they had done! Stay away if you know what is good for you! They grab people walking by and try to entice them with huge promised discounts for products that are way overpriced and not worth even close to what they sell them for!</li>
    <li> If I could, I would give this a ZERO STAR. Just like I said in my review for the day cream (which I also bought along with this) it&#x27;s JUST A WASTE OF MONEY!! I honestly don&#x27;t know why people are giving it 5 stars. My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, but when I used this, my face looked horrible for a week. It turned pinkish red, had all these little bumps and felt swollen and was so itchy. This did nothing except empty my pockets and make me look horrible.</li>
    <li> Same story as everyone else, &amp;#34;Let me give you one for your eyes, too&amp;#34; thinking it&#x27;s another sample, I go in, with my husband, and our GIANT double stroller with two toddlers in it.  The toddlers were just outdoing themselves in this store, but this guy just never came up for breath.  Apparently,  two year olds viciously fighting to death over a cheerio doesn&#x27;t compel him to even speed up.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m beautiful, amazing, I obviously, spend a lot on my skin and clothes.  (Ohh, yes.  Once a week I try to remember to put whatever cream happens to be floating my bathroom counter under my eyes..  And I find my $1 garage sale top r e a l l y brings those eyes out.  Please dude.  But, keep going, since I already have stuff on my face, and I&#x27;m gonna need you to take it off).&lt;br /&gt;He lines up four things, and tells me they&#x27;re 250 each.  BUT, I can have them 199 each.  What a deal.&lt;br /&gt;But then, since I&#x27;m like, I REALLY need to go nap these children, he says, since I have had one of the best reactions, he KNOWS I will tell all my friends, so, he will throw in two of the four for free.&lt;br /&gt;Now, my husband rolls his eyes and leaves the store, which I am still a little resentful at.  He could have been like, &amp;#34;woman, I am not paying for this sh&amp;#34;t, move it&amp;#34;, and I&#x27;d just look at the salesperson, all, &amp;#34;see..  I&#x27;d love to, but my husband.. with iron fist...&amp;#34;  But he just leaves me to clean up this mess.  After all, I was the one wanting the other sample..&lt;br /&gt;When I try to follow him, reasonably, this guy is throwing in ANOTHER product, for free, AND a $600 spa treatment, also for free.  Actually, he says I can even come in with my children, for this hour long treatment.  Umm, what?  That right there is desperation, because there is not a place in this world without a dedicated integrated daycare that will just let you hang out at spa for an hour while they watch your kids,  slather creams on passerby&#x27;s, and try to sell them hundreds of dollars worth of skincare all at once.&lt;br /&gt;Then, he tells me he will also apply a coupon, AND give me his employee discount.  He just really wants to make sure, I will use this stuff every day.  I don&#x27;t even know what this new number will be, and I don&#x27;t care, because if you need to sell this hard, your stuff must not be that good.&lt;br /&gt;But I just hate disappointing people, so I said, all this sounds amazing, I&#x27;m going to go tell my husband what an amazing deal this is, and get his card.  And then I whispered run to my husband outside the store, and we l a u g h e d and laughed about spending $400 (or much less??!) on skincare, even if it is, allegedly worth 1800.  And then I came home and checked into this, just to make sure I didn&#x27;t miss out on looking like Halle Berry for a super low price.  I feel so bad for all these other people.  I can&#x27;t believe that  nice malls allow this place to keep doing business.  It&#x27;s ridiculous.skincare all at once.&lt;br /&gt;Then, he tells me he will also apply a coupon, AND give me his employee discount.  He just really wants to make sure, I will use this stuff every day.  I don&#x27;t even know what this new number will be, and I don&#x27;t care, because if you need to sell this hard, your stuff must not be that good.&lt;br /&gt;But I just hate disappointing people, so I said, all this sounds amazing, I&#x27;m going to go tell my husband what an amazing deal this is, and get his card.

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to love this product, but I really don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s worth the money. The product essentially dries up on contact with air and friction, so it&#x27;s a very gentle exfoliation. Which is great for those of us with sensitive skin, but I simply don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth over $100. There are other products out there that work just as well for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Honestly, most of you guys are complaining about the fact that the sellers are pushy. The product itsself is simply AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 15 years old, nearing 16, and I have super oily skin. I have never had super bad issues with acne though. I&#x27;ve used this product once so far after buying it and my face is ALREADY clearing up the bit of acne I do have GREATLY. I&#x27;d like to clear up some misconceptions of this product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#34;It gets stuck in the peach fuzz on my face and hurts to pull off.&amp;#34; -I had NO issues with this. Perhaps you are using it wrong? You are supposed to apply the Deep Peeling AFTER you take a shower and then rinse it off your face with cold water. ONLY cold water. Not warm water, not using any soaps or facewash. Just cold water and bam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#34;It irritates my skin&amp;#34; -I can&#x27;t necessarily comment on this because we all have different skin types. I will say though that I have very sensitive skin and I have eczema. Certain products cause me to get a rash. But this had no affect on my skin other than clearing up acne. I will admit that the facial I received after my grandmother and I bought the products cause a bit of irritation to my skin. Not as bad as a rash though, just a few itchy places. In this treatment though, the Deep Peeling was not used. He used a Oily Skin specific cleanser and two other products I don&#x27;t remember the name of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#34;The sellers are rude and point out our insecurities and flaws.&amp;#34; -Firstoff, I&#x27;d like to state that this has absolutely nothing to do with the product. Secondly, the seller at this store pointed out that I don&#x27;t have awful acne but that the Deep Peeling will take away the little I do have. Was I insulted? NO. Because I am aware that I have acne. My grandmother had her sunspots and wrinkles pointed out and was she insulted. NO. Because it&#x27;s true. She&#x27;s older. She&#x27;s outside a lot. It&#x27;s gonna happen. That&#x27;s like going to the doctor and being sincerely insulted that the doctor tells you that you&#x27;re overweight. They are just showing you what their product could fix and clear up, not insulting you in a rude manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#34;The sellers are very pushy and rude.&amp;#34; -Again. Nothing to do with the product. The two sellers I encountered were very kind actually and I enjoyed their enthusiasm. They are just trying to sell a product here..Of course they&#x27;re going to drop prices and offer you AMAZING deals and show you how the products work. I mean, come on. As long as you come out with a good product, who cares what the sellers were like? One of the sellers I encountered was named Fezzil (I believe I spelt it right) and he actually opened my eyes. He said something along the lines of &amp;#34;When we look in the mirror, it kind of determines what our day will be like. If we do not like what we see, we will, in turn, have a bad day. I think that is one of the greatest discoveries in life.&amp;#34; I have such low self esteem and this honestly opened my eyes to go for what I want. So, since then, I have started eating healthier and doing more activities. I have decided on a hair color and cut that I would like to go for. And overall, I have decided to change to something I would be happy seeing in the mirror everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product is amazing. It works really well and my face felt completely refreshed after. I cannot wait to see what it does after 1...5...10 uses because of what an amazing job just one use has done.</li>
    <li> I will make this brief.  Even when I am not thrilled with a product, I will use it up because I spent the money on it, and won&#x27;t purchase it again.  However, I have thus far tossed out 2 Orogold products.  The first was an exfoliating product that was so gummy I could not get it off of my skin or hair easily.  They want you to believe that the little rolled up pieces that come about when the product is applied and rubbed in is your dead skin being removed.  It is the drying product, and it&#x27;s very difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next product that ended up in the trash is the 24k Anti Aging Eye Serum.  I kid you not - it made my eyelids look OLDER!  After using it steadily for a few days, I noticed that my eyelids were wrinklier and dry looking.  Then they actually started getting flaky and peeling!  I have never had such an experience with any other product.  In fact, since I stopped using the serum and just started dabbing a little Jojoba or Vitamin E oil on my eyelids, they are looking much better!  I would never use or recommend their products to anyone.  A giant waste of money!</li>
    <li> another story on the Orogold Scam!! I was in the London shop last week (Kensington High Street), actually more forced into the shop than wanting to go in there myself. To make a long story short: after having repeatedly said that I do not want to buy any kind of products (prices are just CRAZY), the guy in the shop, the so called shop owner, made me an offer that in the end I accepted: one facial creme for £ 50. He probably must have thought how stupid I am to even believe him, and this is how I feel afterwards too: I came home, and realized that the nice bag and wrapping of the box were just EMPTY. As a customer, you just feel so violated, you can&#x27; believe how this can happen.&lt;br /&gt;I am now trying to get the money back via the insurance of my credit card company.&lt;br /&gt;Please, do not get trapped like me and believe your gut feeling when you think those guys are not trustworthy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on my story: I contacted the Customer Service in US two times, but never got a reply. Then I contacted CS in UK, and they replied very quickly, apologizing for what happened and even sending me a parcel with tree of the Orogold products. So at least, I have been compensated for what happened.</li>
    <li> Save your money.  This is not better than the $24 stuff they sell at Sam&#x27;s from time to time.  Stay out of their stores.  They will give you a FREE facial after you buy the products and it is not a facial at all.  They just spread their various products on, tell you how much of a difference they make and hand you a mirror.  You are lying on your back so everything looks much better.  They will tell you that this one mask it worth $500 all by itself.  The FREE facial is just a way to get you back in so they can upsell you.  I was beginning to think they were not going to let me off their table until I bought something.  I just kept laughing and telling them I couldn&#x27;t afford it.  So they kept coming down on prices and throwing more stuff at you to make it more attractive.  For a topper they brought in receipts that showed they had made sales just that morning for up to $20,000.    Their products are no better than the cheap version from WalMart.  It is a scam.</li>
    <li> I am a major skin care enthusiast and I know more than enough to understand that there is no magic formula when it comes to skin care. Any company telling you that your skin will look flawless overnight is taking you for a ride. The only two proven items in the skin care world include sunscreens and retinol. I am quite enthusiastic about chemical peels, but they really cost a lot of money. That’s when someone suggested the Deep Peeling to me and said that it is “as good as a chemical peel”. It this was some sales person, I would have looked right through him/ her; but this was my best friend stating so. I decided to try out the peel. After all, she already had the product. It didn’t hurt to try something for free.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit freakish when I saw the amount of dead skin cells that the product exfoliated, but she said that it was normal. Suspicious that it was not my dead skin cells, but something in the product, I tried the product for the next 2 days as well. To my surprise, the amount of grub reduced with each trial. Damn. That was actually my dead skin cells that the 24K Deep Peeling exfoliated. I also found the product to be very mild and gentle on my skin. I mean I used it for 3 straight days and didn’t feel irritation or damage.</li>
    <li> I liked how the scrub that was demonstrated to me had a short list of ingredients and has no smell at all. I got it for half price, and spontaneously got a bangin&#x27; lavander bar of soap for free as i was checking out. If this stuff actually has gold in it, i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s much better than the exfoliator I was going to purchase from the European Wax Center. The dude was a hard hustler but he made me laugh and i left the store in a good mood.</li>
    <li> This is the only skin care product that I have used that gives immediate and consistent results. It gives a professional peel.  I get compliments every time I use it, including from skin care professionals.  The skin glows. Also, a little goes a long way. both in the actual session use, as well as rate of use. One to two times a month max.</li>
    <li> good product. wish I would have started useing it 20 years ago. to late to help this old wrinkled mug out much. but skin feels real good after useing it</li>
    <li> I absolutely cannot fathom why there are so many negative reviews about a product that is so good. I have now been using Orogold for almost 5 years and I haven’t faced any such problems as you guys have described. I usually order for my products online, but there have been a few times that I have gone to the store as well. This one time they even offered me a free facial which was absolutely wonderful. Yes, the sales lady was pushy, but what person working in sales isn’t pushy. That’s how they earn their livelihood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been fooled by one of them to spend a lot of money into the products and I felt terrible, that was until I used the products. One of those products was the deep peeling. I really liked this deep peel from Orogold because it was gentle, it did not cause dryness and it is as good as a deep peel gets. You can easily use this product on your face, irrespective of your skin type and not have to worry about skin damage. I have sensitive skin and I use this peel once every week for the past 5 years. Another thing I would like to state. I really liked that the product contained real gold. That was the deal clincher for me the first time around, and that’s still one of my main fascinations with Orogold products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the pricing could have been lesser, but then I got the same products for a lot less right here on Amazon. Since then, I have been purchasing them from Amazon and I get them for a price that makes them totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I too was innocently walking down the Fashion Place Mall in Murray, Utahl when I got tricked into the Oro Gold store.  Ironically, I had just purchased skincare from Nordstrom&#x27;s and when the Sly, Pushy Saleswoman with the foreign accent grabbed my bag to see what I had bought she said you don&#x27;t have a Peeling Cream and before I know it she was rubbing stuff all over my wrists and face, etc.  The story is the same as the others and when I said \\&quot;No Thanks\\&quot; to the $170 Deep Peeling Cream and got up and started walking away she reduced the price to 50% off and immediately threw in a large bottle of body cream AND another of hand cream.      WAIT!  THERE\\&quot;S MORE!     And then she started in on the face cream again and then when I reminded her of the face cream I just purchased that she had already seen, she sweetly offered to give me two free samples of the face cream that HAS to be used with the Deep Peeling cream to work...and then she said for only $10.00 more I could have the Moisturizing Cream which sold for $170.  She said she was willing to do this because she knew I would be back because I would love all of it so much.    She then said I would be able to get this fabulous deal again and again at the same sale price if I brought back my receipt to show them.  Wow!  This was better than any deal I ever made in Tiajuana and I hardly talked.  She was a SMOOTH OPERATOR.    Then she said that she wasn&#x27;t going to get any commission because of how low she was charging me but not to feel guilty because she knew that I would be back again and again because I would love this product so much.    The whole thing felt \\&quot;OFF\\&quot; but the store looked so beautiful and nice and I&#x27;d never heard of the scams associated with Premier Dead Sea and Vivo Per Lei before.    This is why you NEVER Shop When You Are Tired or incredibly trusting and NAIVE as I am because I do need new exfoliating cream.    Something felt wrong from the start...I should have trusted my instincts but she was so goodand I&#x27;m so naive and it all happened so fast and seemed too good to be true!    As soon as she ran up my credit card and handed me my receipt she said...\\&quot;There is no refund\\&quot;.  I thought, now that is odd because I do have allergic reactions sometimes to cosmetics but I was so tired I didn&#x27;t get to play that game with her because I stupidly didn&#x27;t bring it up.  What company in good standing says that anyway when they are dealing with skin products?  What reputable company won&#x27;t do refunds at all in any case?    There was no sign as has been stated in other stores either.    So then  I\\&quot;m walking down the mall again thinking, \\&quot;I just got pushed into spending my precious Christmas money on something I didn&#x27;t even want or can afford right now and now I can&#x27;t get a refund no matter what\\&quot;?  As I am thinking about how stupid I was, I walk by a Kiosk with a dark haired young woman and man.  They see my bag of Oro Gold cosmetics and they scream out, \\&quot;What did you buy?\\&quot; with excited eyes!  The young lady with....drumroll....another foreign accent... pulls open my bag and says, \\&quot;You didn&#x27;t get the Serum\\&quot; and she sits me down on her stool and starts putting stuff around my eyes and tells me I shouldn&#x27;t be lazy not to take care of my eyes and \\&quot;Look, can&#x27;t I see the difference?\\&quot;.  This is before I can say a word to either of them. Once I realize it is yet another skin care company and I don&#x27;t need a thing I start to stand up as I know that giving excuses will just get me more product and pressure.     Then as I stand up she says, \\&quot;I will give it to you 50% off\\&quot; and starts in with the same lines I just got at Oro Gold.  But she can only do 50% off  today  and ....blah, blah.  I said, \\&quot;Are you the same company as Oro Gold?\\&quot; and she started to stammer and looked stunned and the young man with the foreign accent yelled out \\&quot;Why You Think That?\\&quot; in an aggressive way.    I was smarter this time and turned and walked away and came home and researched and I found them not only to be the same company as each other and the Premier Dead Sea line... which is under investigation by the FDA for fraud now but...they have the same address!    Yes, this is their address...both companies...  20255 Corisco St.,  Chatsworth, CA 91311    And....more SCAM!  This address is listed as a \\&quot;Herstyler\\&quot; called LIONESS BEAUTY BAR on the Bing Maps page.    How are they getting away with this in our local malls?????    This is a HUGE SCAM!    We need to report these CON ARTISTS!!!    So to my fellow Americans I say this:    I GRIEVE WITH YOU IN YOUR LOSSES!  I never write reviews on here but SOMETHING needs to be done!    I am so shocked that these people are robbing us in our local malls under our own noses!    As for the Positive Reviews on here...I have found many if not most to use phrases that we Americans don&#x27;t use such as \\&quot;bought for\\&quot; and then I read that they are asking people to write the reviews in some of the stores and they coach them on what to say.  This must be so the Positive Reviews sound more genuine.  This product is being sold all over the world and they are getting away with it!    I am not an Impulse Buyer...I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend as money is very tight.....and I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how they were able to rob me of $75 when I am on such a strict budget.    These people are TRAINED WELL!    As for the product, I opened my Deep Peeling jar and it wasn&#x27;t even full...and it wasn&#x27;t sealed either and it wasn&#x27;t the same sweet smelling stuff they so effectively convinced me of in the store.    I&#x27;m so embarrassed I was taken for a RIDE!    Beware of the Positive Feedback and buy your skin products from sources that have stood the test of time.    Feeling Stupid in Salt Lake City!</li>
    <li> Bought this over priced product in Vegas. Used one time and left my face so red, swollen and burning that I am two days later still taking Benadryl, putting prescription medication for hives on my face and neck and laying in bed with an ice pack on my face. Unbelievable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product (actually the sea salt rub, peal, moisturizer) at a mall in Casper, Wy.  I fell for it hook, line and sinker.  The salesperson said it would benefit someone I know with rosacea.  I brought it home and used it myself.  I sneezed my head off, I guess it is the fragrance, which is quite strong.  I spent $200, and I can&#x27;t take it back.  It is my fault for not researching it here first.</li>
    <li> My mom and I were just minding our own business having a bonding day at the mall when we reeled in by a salesman at one of these stores. He handed my mom a little plastic bag and said it was a free moisturizer sample and my mom accepted and thanked him and he said hold on let me get one for your eyes too! She said no thanks and we kept walking and then he asked us if we were locals and we said yes and he somehow convinced us to go into the store. BIG MISTAKE. The salesman&#x27;s hands were all crusty and my mom commented when he shook our hands and he told us that he had been putting a fence in at his brother&#x27;s house all weekend. Next he tells us to take a seat side by side in these white chairs. So instead of getting another little sample packet like we thought, we wasted an hour or so of our lives being strong armed, belittled, and guilt tripped into buying a product that he sold to us &amp;#34;at store price&amp;#34; (which was a load of crap). He commented on any flaw he could find on our faces and told us how the products could fix everything. He made my mom feel bad for not &amp;#34;taking care of her skin&amp;#34;, even though she does, just not with this crap. He tried to coerce her into buying three products by cutting the price in half and didn&#x27;t seem at all phased when we told him that we aren&#x27;t made of money and can&#x27;t afford to spend that much. He tested the product on our wrists, but for some reason he tested on the top of my mom&#x27;s wrist and on the bottom (the soft side) of my wrist. I thought it was odd, but I didn&#x27;t say anything. He then starts to tell us about how orogold is an American company and he&#x27;d rather give his money to an American company rather than a Chinese one. He never actually said that the products are made in America, but he did rather strongly imply that by saying that they started making it in Italy and the company has since moved to America. I feel like that in itself is false advertising. But then he has the audacity to comment on my mom&#x27;s fine linesand wrinkles and even asks her if she is a smoker because she apparently has &amp;#34;smokers lines&amp;#34; and then tried to convince her that this scrub would make all her age spots and sun spots vanish. I was appalled that he would try to make her feel bad about herself just so she&#x27;d buy this product. Then he pulled the same trick on me when he told me that the scrub would remove dead skin and the moisturizer would provide a better base for my skin so that when I apply makeup it doesn&#x27;t just look like I have a powdery substance all over my face. What good-hearted person would EVER think that it is okay to belittle someone and point out their insecurities just to sell a stupid product?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking at reviews online, which I wish I did while sitting in the store, I read that other people had the same problem I did with this deep peeling thing. It worked fine on the rest of my face, but my cheeks were left bumpy and raw from scrubbing so hard to get the dead skin off of my face. At first I thought it was dead skin half holding on and just balling up on my cheeks, but then I read that its actually the peach fuzz all knotted up. Another reviewer said that the salesman warned her not to use it on peach fuzz, but I was apparently not lucky enough to be warned.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing our salesman didn&#x27;t warn us about was the no refund policy, nor the exchange within 14 days policy. That is also very misleading; any decent salesperson should warn you about final sale or non refundable products.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that anybody out there reading this will take my advice and stay away from orogold. Don&#x27;t let them play on your desire for the &#x27;miracle product&#x27;. They will use your emotions against you and make you feel degraded just to make a profit. People like that don&#x27;t deserve even a nanosecond of your time.&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow we are off to the store to speak our mind to them about their practice. I hope our second trip there is more successful than our first trip when we fell intothe trap.</li>
    <li> I have never heard of this product and I&#x27;m a wrinkle/mask/pore-refining nazi. I&#x27;ve been using top quality creams since highschool and at 33, people think I look 23. With that being said, while visiting Boston at the Copley Mall, I was hunted by these pressure selling vultures. They started off by giving my friend and I, a sample then pounced on me like a cat to a mouse. I didn&#x27;t want anything applied to my face because I had make-up on so he started applying this peeling crap lotion to my arm. Mind you, I exfoliate everyday. In my younger days, I worked for Bath and Body Works so I know a thing or two about creams, lotions and exfoliators yet this &amp;#34;peeling&amp;#34; cream miracously made A TON of dead skin come off the underside of my forearm. Oh please..... There&#x27;s something in that product that makes it thicken and crumble with friction to appear that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;releasing&amp;#34; dead skin. It&#x27;s really not your dead skin. As a health professional and chemist, there&#x27;s something in there. Next is a white cream that was applied followed by another white cream. He told me that these creams would help the redness on my cheeks which I assured him was just blush. I told him that I would come back tomorrow (which I had no intention to) in which he became annoyed and kept asking why I wouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;buy today.&amp;#34; I like to tell off pushy sales people so I stood my ground and said I want to see how my arm feels the rest of the day. (Plus I&#x27;m someone who likes to read reviews before I purchase something.) As far as my research goes, most reviews are TERRIBLE for these products and the ridiculous experience and the products are extremely overpriced! Do NOT fall into their trap.</li>
    <li> I have read some reviews and articles about this ORO Gold.  Everyone hates their sales tactics.  They prey on people who cannot say \\&quot;No&#x27;.  I am one of them.  I was pulled in to try eye cream today and that was the end of it.  I am not the type of person who can say \\&quot;What part of NO! do you not understand!\\&quot; and walk away.  I wish I have today.  I would not buy any of their products so they sold me their Deep Peeling for $80 so I guess that is not too bad.  I just bought this today so I cannot say anything about the product but as I said I think people get together and sue this company for fraudulent business practice.  I need to find out how we all can sue this company.</li>
    <li> I came online to review the Orogold 24K Deep Peeling and I was actually kinda surprised to see the kind of reviews that the brand has got here. I had myself experienced the Orogold store a couple of weeks back and I can understand why many of the people over here are a bit pissed about the store. But, I really don&#x27;t see how the experiences were so bad.    Now, let me introduce these stores to you before I talk about the product. The Orogold store leaves no effort when it comes to offering you with a beautiful and luxurious setting. I mean these things could easily pass off as spas and not simple skin care product stores. Now, onto the point why so many people are pissed. Firstly, they clearly mention no refunds at the cash counter. I don&#x27;t know why people didn&#x27;t see that. Secondly, yes, their salespeople are a bit pushy, but come on, what salesperson in the world isn&#x27;t. You just need to handle them better.    Now onto the main part. The 24K Deep Peeling. I believe that when you&#x27;re choosing a luxury skin care brand, it&#x27;s not just about the product. A product this expensive has to be great. I think its more about the experience. This is where Orogold gets top marks from me. Right from that enchanting gold packaging to the gold certificate in each product to the quantity of the product, everything was super cool.    The products themselves weren&#x27;t substandard either. I purchased the 24K Deep Peeling and have used it once a week (as directed by the expert at the store) for the past two weeks. I really think it&#x27;s still early to evaluate the product, but here are my first impressions. I use a regular cleanser twice a day, but my skin still feels a bit rough after cleansing. When I began to add the deep peeling as a part of my routine, I have actually seen a huge difference over the past 2 weeks.    My skin feels much smoother now and it actually feels like there&#x27;s this beautiful shine to it. I understand that the deep peeling alone is not responsible for this, but boy, myskin has really started to look good since I have started using the product. May be, this was the missing ingredient in my skin care routine!!    Thank you Orogold!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! It is the only product that has amazed my facialist with my skin. Smooth, great pores, nothing clogged...worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t write my experience at the Orogold store at our local mall because it&#x27;s identical to so many other reviewers&#x27; stories. I&#x27;m very mad at myself for falling for their strong-armed sales pitch. Any of you who are considering buying this product: DON&#x27;T. It&#x27;s wildly expensive per ounce and doesn&#x27;t do anything special. I&#x27;m calling the Better Business Bureau.</li>
    <li> I believe that when you’re choosing a peel for your face, the lesser the ingredients, the better. The secret is not in packing the product with hundreds of useless ingredients. The secret is to offer those few perfect ingredients which work well together. Most products that I have seen contain so many ingredients, many of which are not a “healthy” option for the face. But, that’s not the case with Orogold. Yes, it uses a lesser number of ingredients, but each ingredient used in the product is a quality skin care ingredient. I think this is what makes Orogold products so effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orogold states that each of their products undergoes a lot of research and it clearly shows in their products. The Deep Peeling not only sloughed off my skin, it also helped me reveal a smoother and younger looking skin. It&#x27;s so sad that the company doesn’t offer the same quality when it comes to sales people. Coz the product definitely cannot disappoint so many customers. It is that good.</li>
    <li> I paid over $700.00 for their product and realized I&#x27;d been fooled when my skin broke out in a terrible rash and they wouldn&#x27;t refund my money. I&#x27;m disgusted with their violation of people&#x27;s innocence! After doing more research I discovered that they pay people over seas to write reviews for their products!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a skincare junkie, and read enough about the industry to know that most of it is bunk (except sunscreen. Always wear sunscreen). Aside from retinoids, there aren&#x27;t many topical products that are going to do much except moisturize your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get microdermabrasion and chemical peels a few times a year, because those legitimately work. Given the amount of money that costs, I figured if I could replace a few sessions with using OroGold, it might be cheaper in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used OroGold twice now, and have already noticed a difference. The pores around my nose are smaller, and I have a horizontal wrinkle between my eyes that is already shallower. Your skin will also suck up more moisturizer after you use the peel, so I use serum afterwards to give it a boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a lot of complaints about OroGold&#x27;s selling practices, and I agree that their salespeople are hella annoying (I bought mine from a store in Boston, and would order it online just to avoid having to deal with the salespeople). However, they are trained to offer you free stuff if you seem balky about buying it, so I may just suck it up and go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how effective the gold itself is, and I would say that this is probably not the best product for sensitive skin or skin that has reactions easily, because it does peel off the top layer. But I think it works, it&#x27;s less uncomfortable than a chemical peel, and you don&#x27;t have 2-3 days of recovery time like you do with microdermabrasion. I&#x27;m pretty skeptical when it comes to beauty products, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve written a review for Amazon because I&#x27;m that impressed with the product.</li>
    <li> I certainly do not recommend this product.  It is very sticky and awful and it clumps around facial hair.  It also caused a slight breakout.  My usual chemical exfoliator that costs 90% less works considerably better.  Stay away from this company there is something incredibly fishy about their products and sales tactics.</li>
    <li> 1st time I bought this product it was from their store in Century City.  Product worked so well, so I decided to buy more of it here on Amazon because of the better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, this product made me break out in 5 different areas around my chin.  Keep in mind, my skin is really clear and I rarely ever get any pimples at all.  Maybe 2 times a year.  Something different must be in the formulation now, or maybe just from this seller.  I requested a refund and hope they will honor it.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from dark circles or puffy eyes the way I do, this product is certainly one of your best options. Before using the OROGOLD Eye Serum, I would have to force myself to look into the mirror and check out the state of those hideous dark circles. But, now I spend so much time in front of the mirror just looking at my beautiful eye area and applying these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eye Serum is an ideal product to make your puffiness disappear. It allows you to reduce the amount of makeup you need to apply in no time at all and it also helps you to get that natural look that everyone is crazy for nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered for the products online and got them at a much cheaper price as well. I guess that’s why I didn’t face the issues that you guys did. For me, there were no pesky salespeople. Just my comfy computer area and my beautiful laptop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also liked the way OROGOLD packages its products. The packaging alone makes you want to buy them. They have this beautiful gold colored box along with a satin bed on which the products are placed like little princesses. There’s a gold certificate which proves the use of real gold in the product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think its an amazing product to have and I would definitely recommend it to everyone out there.</li>
    <li> A year of complete bliss!&lt;br /&gt;I see so many of my friends cribbing about their skin, I feel blessed to be able to afford and use Orogold. I have been using Orogold for almost one year and I have based my entire skin care routine around their products (except the cleanser). I like to use a foaming cleanser. Their cleanser is one of those swipe-with-a-cotton-ball things. I agree that the brand suffers because of pushy sales tactics, but it’s nothing that people cannot handle. I went through the same thing and I am sure that the sales lady wouldn’t have made buy anything that I didn’t want. I agree that the products are expensive, but hey, that’s what premium products cost. I love the Deep Peeling, Vitamin C Serum, the Day Moisturizer and almost all of their masks. The Deep Peeling sloughs off your skin perfectly. I mean for the amount of skin that it sloughs off, you would expect your skin to burn. But, the product doesn’t burn your skin at all. In fact, if anything, it is really gentle on your skin.</li>
    <li> I suffered from a few skin issues on my face and neck area. I started using Orogold and my skin transformed from looking dead and snaky to looking young and supple within days. I think a single application of the 24K Deep Peeling was enough to give your skin a boost of cleansing and transform my skin. I also added the Day Moisturizer and an Eye Serum to my routine. I don’t understand all the ruckus either. I was greeted by some of the most polite and knowledgeable people at the Orogold Store. They even put in a few free facials that I could redeem within one year. How cool is that? A few other products on my list are the Vitamin C Cleanser, the Vitamin C Mask and the Nano Collection. I must say that I find Orogold products to be really cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note – I would also like to tell you guys that the product is expensive. Well, why wouldn’t it be. It has real gold in it! Another thing.  Orogold can be really high pressure sales stuff. Their sales people are really pushy and if you haven’t been taught to read these tactics, you’d better purchase the products online. Finally, the company doesn’t offer any refunds. This is clearly written behind the cash counter at the store. I do not understand why people say that they didn&#x27;t get refunds. Didn’t you read the sign?</li>
    <li> Pushy sales, horrible sales people and highly expensive products are some of the weaker points of Orogold. But, when it comes to the product itself, you really cannot fault the company. Like so many other people over here, I was fooled into purchasing one product too many and was then denied a refund. I felt embarrassed when I had to tell my husband that I spent almost $700 on products that I don’t think I would ever need. Surprisingly, he was calm enough and told me to at least try them out since I had already paid so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that was the best piece of advice that he ever gave me. Apart from getting married to him of course ☺. I have particularly fallen in love with the Deep Peeling. It really exfoliates the skin and leaves it looking young and beautiful. You’d be surprised at the amount of dead skin that the Deep Peeling can help you get rid of. Make sure that you use your hands while using the product. Using the pad will lead to a lot of product wastage.</li>
    <li> I found the product to be superb. It is non irritating and very mild as well. The best thing about the product is that i have sensitive skin and I can still use the product without worrying about damage or irritation. It doesn’t leave the skin high and dry either. When the I used the product for the first time, it was a bit scary. The amount of dead skin that came off, I thought that something had happened to my skin. I immediately called up their customer care number and they told me that it was actually my skin coming off and there was nothing to worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I was shaky the rest of the day. My fears disappeared the next day when my skin actually began to shine and glow. I got the products right here on Amazon and I found out later on that I was lucky enough to avoid the store. I think that the Orogold 24K Deep Peeling is a superb option for anyone wanting the perfect exfoliator. People with all skin types can enjoy its wonders as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this after being accosted by a salesman in San Francisco. The sales pitch was hard to take; basically the salesman innsiuates that you are old looking but has a smile on his face the whole time. While I did not care for the dramatic tactics (after reading multiple reviews I think this is a company wide phenomenon), I have to say this product works for me. I was looking for something to help exfoliate my skin better. This is the first product where I can appreciate a noticeable difference. If you are able to keep your word about you and effective ely ignore 90% of what the salesman is trying to pawn off on you ($400 for eye pads, really??!!) you maybe pleasantly surprised as I was</li>
    <li> I recently ordered for the 24K Deep Peeling on Amazon and just got the delivery a couple of hours back. The original price of this product was $100, but I got it for much less on Amazon. Now, when I opened the packaging, I realized why they had set the price at $100. Anything this beautiful would cost that much. Good thing I got that discount then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the gold embossing on the package and the personal touch – they add a gold certificate which proves the use of real gold in the product. I really liked the gold jar as well. It looked so rich. I am sure that it would look super sexy on my dressing table. I’m not really convinced about the skin benefits of gold, I think gold is more of a mental thing. But, I liked the other ingredients in this peel a lot. Each of them were extremely beneficial for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to test the product on my skin. After rubbing the product on my freshly cleansed skin, I immediately saw some of my dead skin getting sloughed off. For those of you new to skin care, that’s lesson number 1. Cleansers cannot slough off your dead skin cells. There’s nothing new about the way this product exfoliates your skin. There’s something to do with its chemistry that allows it to exfoliate your skin when you massage it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also liked the fact that the deep peeling was very gentle on the skin. Not many peels can actually boast of being gentle. Overall, I feel that the Orogold 24K deep peeling is an excellent way to exfoliate your skin. You also need to use this product just once a week. Which makes it last a really long while as well. Pretty much everything you need – looks nice, feels nice and leaves the skin feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether or not you would pay the amount of money that this product costs or not is another matter altogether. I really liked them and I decided to indulge in them. And I certainly have no regrets. The deep peel is a great exfoliator.</li>
    <li> Oro Gold products are made with colloidal gold. The sales pitch promoting the use of 24k gold in their products doesn&#x27;t mention that there is probably only a fraction of 1 cent of gold in the entire tube or jar - certainly not enough to justify the inflated prices. Colloidal gold used to be used to treat very severe rheumatoid arthritis in the past, but because of the possibility of serious side effects, it rarely is now. Long term use of colloidal gold can cause a condition called CHRYSIASIS, which, besides causing problems such as kidney failure, is famous for turning your skin blue, mauve, or grey! Use of colloidal silver causes a similar condition called argyria. While reported cases of chrysiasis are usually caused by colloidal gold being injected (for rheumatoid arthritis) or taken internally, medication and toxic substances can be absorbed by the skin (think of nicotine patches or other trans-dermal patches such as those for sea-sickness). While short-term use of Oro Gold products is unlikely to cause any problems, I would be very cautious about using them for any length of time. Next time you are grabbed by one of their snake oil salesmen, shout \\&quot;Chrysiasis!!!\\&quot; in their ear and walk on.</li>
    <li> I was walking through the mall at Passeo Neuvo in Santa Barbara Ca about a month ago, when a man approached me with a sample of lotion. He explained that the lotion had gold in it and that their products were the best in the world.  I went into the store and he tried out some other products on my arm saying that the arm skin is the most similar skin on the body to the face.  If they were supposed to be face products then why didn&#x27;t he just put them on my face?  During the demonstration he would not answer any questions about price, obviously people who go into their store are not concerned about price.  He asked if I have a skin care routine and I explained that I see both a Dermatologist and and Aesthetician and use the products they recommend.  Usually the M. D.  sends me to Walgreens because it is close and has all the products I need, and he generally will instruct me to buy the cheapest brand because they usually are the same quality.  Well that day at Oro Gold Cosmetics, I was duped, and met with high pressure salesmen, who know nothing about skin care, but repeatedly tell you that they are concerned for your well being and are there to help.  He even went so far as to compare his line of work to mine in the medical field in that we are both in the helping professions.  Now I agreed to buy the face moisturizer at around $100.  He explained that none of the products work alone and that they can be bundled and then you receive a better price.  So I bought some eye cream and some facial cleanser for a total of $388.78.  It didn&#x27;t stop here though.  Next, since I bought these products he offered a free facial, and I thought since my aesthetician charges close to $200 it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try the free facial.  Whoops, this was only a ploy to get me in the back room of their store laying down and relaxed and more of his flattery to sell me more products.  The products he now wanted to sell were close to $10,000, but of course they have a cheaper line and you could get most of what you need, yes need for $270.  I paid the $270 and then proceeded to leave.  I opted to have the items shipped because I was on vacation and had flown out there and could not transport all these liquids in my carry-on.  When I arrived at my hotel that night I review my receipts and read on the bottom of the receipt that they do not take returns.  Now what kind of retailer does not take returns?  I tried to call them at the store the next day, but there number goes to some warehouse in LA and the receptionist doesn&#x27;t speak English very well, but tells me that the manager is not available.  I called my credit card company, Wells Fargo, but they said that since the store takes no returns, and that my card was in my possession at the point of sale, they could not help me.  Next time I will use American Express, they have always got my money back and are helpful.  I have reported this to the mall management and they have received several complaints.  They are reporting these complaints to property management.  Next I am going to report this to BBB and California Department of Consumer Affairs.  I urge you, do not walk into their store or buy their product on line. These common thieves need to be stopped.</li>
    <li> I was stopped by a sells person at the Stonestown mall offering me this product.  I was very suspicious even after I bought it.  But I thought to myself, I spent $100 on facial at times anyway and this is a 1 year supply.  I tried only once and my face looks years younger!  I recommend everyone to try it.  Ask the sells person to try it on your hand first to see if you like it.  However, do not use too much or for too long or it can be drying for a while.</li>
    <li> ...and even if you pay $20...you&#x27;re still be getting ripped off.    Apparently you can get those super annoying sales people to let you buy this for $20, because that is exactly how low an offer I got in SF when I kept refusing their \\&quot;deal\\&quot;.    Also know that gold is not considered an active ingredient by the FDA, and scientist/doctors say that it won&#x27;t do anything for your skin, but it is an allergen...so be careful.    If the product has been found to be working, it&#x27;s not the gold they put in that is making it work, so don&#x27;t pay a premium for an ingredient that doesn&#x27;t work.    Last, but not least, read a few articles about it, if nothing else;[...]</li>
    <li> Wow! I cannot believe all of these negative reviews on this absolutely amazing product! I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but after seeing all of these negative reviews on my favorite skin care line, I felt compelled to add my experience.  Especially since I have been using it for over seven years, long before anyone even knew what orogold was.  Yes, it is true the sales tactics are pushy, but what salesmen aren&#x27;t?  I was talked into buying it while on Vacation in Vegas about 7 years ago, and spent WELL OVER $1000 on everything. Which sucked! I totally felt fooled.  But, when I returned home and started using the products I was amazed! My favorites were the Gold deep peel, all day moisturizer, and seaweed and collagen mask for my face.  I also use the body scrub and body butter.  I dreaded when they ran out because I did not want to pay that price again.... BUT NOW I HAD TO HAVE THEM So I started searching online.  At this time it was easy to find all of these products for about $150-$200 TOTAL from ebay and/or amazon.  I felt like a fool for paying so much in the beginning but the results on my face were worth it! I have been using these products for the full seven years now, and I swear I have not aged. Gold is a secret that has been used for thousands of years, to keep the wealthy and important young looking.  It does work! I am living proof.  I am almost 30 years old now, and people still think I am 19/20.  I owe it to orogold. I don&#x27;t care about the pushy sales, I am so glad I bought this product and have continued using it all of these years.  However, I am sad that is getting more and more difficult to find them at good prices online. I don&#x27;t care though, I will never stop using it, but I will also always try to get the best price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to add, it is not the product coming off when using the deep peel, IT IS YOUR DEAD SKIN CELLS.  You can prove this to yourself by using it a few days in a row, which I occasionally do, when I see those lines appearing.... and really need a good peel..  Less and less \\&quot;dead skin cells\\&quot; come off with each day.  For me, by the third or fourth day, there is no \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; or \\&quot;skin cells\\&quot; coming off at all.  Which is when I stop using it and give my face a break for a few weeks.  If it was just the product coming off, and not your own skin, the consistency would be the same regardless of how often you were using it.  You know it is actually your dead skin cells coming off when by the third day of continual use there is no more dead skin cells to come off, the product does work, amazingly! I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  I guess I would really look my age.  Which I think I am happy looking 19 at the age of 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE MORE THING ...  When choosing any skin care product, especially for your face, the least amount of ingredients, THE BETTER.  Most products have a load of ingredients, in them , which is NOT GOOD for your body or face.  The minimal amount of ingredients in orogold are all top quality ingredients, that are actually good for your face and/or body.  There are no unnecessary ingredients in these products whatsoever.  WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT SO AMAZING.  And the gold is what actually stimulates your bodies ability for faster cell renewal.  You do not want to buy a product with a bunch of crap in it an than rub it on your face/body!  I am sad to see so many turned off by the product by the pushy sales people.  Because if you actually used the product there is absolutely NO WAY you could possibly be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought facial cream and the peeling face wash with eyecream and there terrible !!!  its a rip off and the store clerks are high pressure high pressure</li>
    <li> Oro Gold, along with Vine Vera and Vivo Per Lei are part of an elaborate international scam run by an Israeli company called Mazal Enterprises, based in California. Worryingly, there are hundreds of fake reviews on pretty much every website singing the praises of these bogus brands. The salespeople, who claim to be dermatologists, use high-pressure sales techniques and false advertising to sell their terrible products for exorbitant prices. All the positive reviews are fabricated. If you care to check the reviewers&#x27; history you will find that they review the same products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters the moisturiser (incidentally, I wouldn&#x27;t put this anywhere near my face - a quick look at the ingredients and it&#x27;s a blend of cheap petroleum-sourced emollients and emulsifiers, sunflower oil and toxic preservatives)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example the 24K Deep Day Moisturizer Cream, for example, include Propylene Glycol (petroleum-sourced compound found in anti-freeze. Considered toxic in the USA - skin contact or inhalation can cause brain, liver and kidney abnormalities), Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil (an exotic way of saying sunflower oil), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (another cheap oily liquid, derived from coconut oil), Betaine Monohydrate (a compound derived from the waste of the sugar beet molasses industry, commonly used in animal feeds), Isopropyl Myristate (a solvent that is readily absorbed by the skin, used in flea and tick products for pets by dissolving the wax that covers the exoskeleton of the parasites, killing them by dehydration), Cetearyl Alcohol (used in hair conditioners to give hair that waxy feel) Cetearyl Glucoside (emulsifier found in shampoos and conditioners), Peg-100 Stearate (used on damaged or broken skin causes kidney problems), Petrolatum (petroleum jelly), Triethanolamine (emulsifier which is approved as an indirect food additive - aka it can be used in packaging), C13-14 Isoparaffin (a mixture of *mineral oils* derived from petroleum), Methylisothiazolinone (a preservative no longer used by brands such as Piz Buin, Nivea, Vaseline and Huggies due to the high number of adverse reactions), Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate (used for years as a preservative in water-based paints, metal-working fluids and as a wood preservative, toxic by inhalation and restricted for use in cosmetics in Japan)&lt;br /&gt;These ingredients, for example the mineral oil (one of the worst skincare offenders), are petroleum by-products that coat the skin like plastic, clogging the pores and interfering with skin&#x27;s ability to eliminate toxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst offender is the 24K Deep Peeling Mask. The salesperson will tell you that the white beads that form on your hand are impurities, toxins and *dead skin.* IN FACT, the residue which forms as the salesperson massages the gel into your skin is down to a reaction similar to that of PVA glue. The chemical reaction between cetrimonium chloride and carbomer (thickener) will produce these white beads/residue on any surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live near an Orogold store and get a free sample almost every day. I still wouldn&#x27;t put their products anywhere *near* my skin.azolinone (a preservative no longer used by brands such as Piz Buin, Nivea, Vaseline and Huggies due to the high number of adverse reactions), Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate (used for years as a preservative in water-based paints, metal-working fluids and as a wood preservative, toxic by inhalation and restricted for use in cosmetics in Japan)&lt;br /&gt;These ingredients, for example the mineral oil (one of the worst skincare offenders), are petroleum by-products that coat the skin like plastic, clogging the pores and interfering with skin&#x27;s ability to eliminate toxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst offender is the 24K Deep Peeling Mask.

    <li> I tried the peeling exfoliator and other Oro Gold products and woke up the next day with a red, swollen and itchy face full of hives. Four days later and my skin is still itchy, tight and uncomfortable. I have heard of the same thing happening to one other girl only last week. When complaining to the shop in the very small town of Gibraltar was informed by the manager that in the 1 year the shop has been opened (only!!) 15 allergic reaction cases have been reported. 15 cases in a small town like Gibraltar to me sounds like a lot...my advise: do not go near any Oro Gold products if you want to look after your skin!</li>
    <li> Avoid this place at all costs!  I had the misfortune of going in their salon in Key West and ended up purchasing merchandise before I realized what I had sone.  The salesman, Nicholas, was very aggressive, talked extremely fast with an accent and I fell for his pitch.  After thought, I called to tell him not to ship the product, but to refund my credit card and he refused even though he told me that I could return everything if I didn&#x27;t like it.  He is a LIAR.  If I could do a rating lower than 1, I would.</li>
    <li> I am so glad people have taken the time to write their review on this product, I nearly got sucked in myself today in the Perth store, my story is identical to everybody else&#x27;s.  I am so relieved I did not purchase it.</li>
    <li> This one really helps with removing that dead layer of skin.  It leaves skin feeling great.  I use it 3-4 times a week.</li>
    <li> I have always had positive results with this peel. Its wonderful. Ihave purcahsed it at least 8 time becaus e it is so much more affordabe on Amazon. I have also gifted these purchases on several occasions.</li>
    <li> I think I am the only person in the history of orogold that would admit that they did not pull me in. I was curious by the elegance of the store and I went in. I was given a presentation in the Dallas galleria and was impressed. I love my skin care products but 128 for a tiny bottle was not something I was willing to pay. I got this product all the way down to 68 but still did not purchase. I know how this works I got pulled into a Killeen mall Kiosk for a dead sea product that absolutely worked wonders but when I went on ebay, I almost kicked myself for the price I  paid so in the case of orogold, that is what I did. I went to ebay and found the products much much lower. A 13 hundred dollar mask for 20 and a starter kit that was 200 for 33. These products are excellent but unless you are midas do not purchase in the store. Go to the site or find what you want at the store and then look for them online. If a product is 128 dollars how can they then afford to sell it for 68?</li>
    <li> I should just copy/paste the reviews...it&#x27;s like the same MO for all of them! These sales reps have been trained good! My was a female..she went for my eyes..of course..any emollient will immediately soften the delicate eye skin, so you&#x27;ll notice the difference w the untreated eye! She did the peel on the inside of my wrist. Another tactic..the bottom of your wrist is a lot softer than the top, so you&#x27;ll feel that it&#x27;s soft after the peel..I tried my darnest to get away..I almost felt I was held captive at the store..as many times I asked the rep for the product&#x27;s info (brochures, paraphernalia) she kept avoiding me by showing me a magazine where D Richards is all over ( I don&#x27;t even like her) so to make this story short, she dropped the peel from $128 to $90 &amp; gave me a bunch of samples of the day cream..She said she travels to Vegas back &amp; forth but that she wants me to come back in 3 mo &amp; show her how my skin is after using the peel once a week for 3 month! &amp; at that time, she will give the eye cream for free if I buy the serum! I knew I was going to regret this but my $90 is nothing in comparison to what I&#x27;ve read today! I tried the peel and OMG! Could NOT get it off my face! I scrubbed &amp; rubbed..splashed tons of water &amp; the little fuzzy grainy stuff still on my face! I finally took a cotton saturated w my Clarins toner y it got the rest of the gooie stuff out! When I read the receipt &amp;#34; no refunds&amp;#34; I nearly die! I feel like writing to D Richardson and tell her to read all of the reviews! I mean, 90% of them r the same! I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it! I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m up to going back &amp; having to hear their rhetoric! PLEASE DONT GO INSIDE THE OROGOLD STORES! Run! I&#x27;m not being facetious.. RUN! Don&#x27;t even look back! If there would be a minus star rating, I would!</li>
    <li> I pass by the orogold shop in high street kensington in London at least twice a week, i have never even accepted their sample once! The sale people are changing all the time because their job is so bad as they have to catch people on the street to sell their product, plus since when cosmetics are sold that way? One even told me: &#x27;madam a cream with gold in it&#x27;, since when gold does anything for the skin? Gold is for nice jewellery, not for the skin. This is just one of those typical marketing trick. In 4 years i have passing by i only stopped once but regretted it. When the guy understood that i wasn&#x27;t interested he became aggressive and said stuff that made me feel uneasy (can&#x27;t remember what). It&#x27;s obvious that the staff is paid only if they sell something, and that is the reason number one i wouldn&#x27;t buy anything from this company. So the staff is abused so that they abuse customer with a product that itself is questionable. Don&#x27;t buy this stuff, the ethics of this company sucks. Their selling methods are unacceptable and straight from middle-age. I don&#x27;t even want to know what is in their product.</li>
    <li> Hello guys. I don’t know about what their stores are like because I got these products home delivered, so I cannot comment on that. But, the product is something that I can definitely comment on based on my own experience with Orogold. I ordered for the product right here on Amazon and I am really delighted with my experience. First of all, the product that I got was at a healthy discount. I love saving a buck wherever I can. So hey, if I don’t get a luxurious store and get a discount on the product, I’m as happy as I can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered for the 24K Deep Peeling and I am really really impressed. I have just used the peel for a month till now, but my whiteheads have actually all but disappeared with just 6 applications. My face also feels so soft its not funny. Best part? My pores also look smaller. I used to hate those huge sized pores. Major lifesaver, this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you something else guys. I am a major skin care enthusiast and I love to keep checking the ingredients that these brands include. I have found very few brands that don’t contain any harmful ingredients. Don’t believe me? Try it out. I did the same for the Orogold product. Wow. They really contain luxurious ingredients. Here, let me name some. Gold. Vitamin C. Vitamin E. Green Tea. Panthenol. Rings a bell? All of them are amazing anti-aging ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I really liked about the product was the presence of gold. Yea, they have real gold, which is imported from Italy in their products. They even offer you with a gold certificate in each product as a proof of the use of gold in the product. I personally don’t feel that gold has any skin benefits, but hey, what girl doesn’t like to pamper herself by adding exotic ingredients like gold in her skin care routine. It does not harm the skin at all. And hey, it’s gold.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from skin issues for ages. A poor lifestyle was believed to be the major culprit and my lack of sleep had actually started to make my eye area look horrendous. I wasn&#x27;t too serious about cleansing my skin either. Now, when it really became bad, I tried a number of products, but to no avail. Some worked, but they definitely didn&#x27;t do much.     That&#x27;s when I came across Orogold. I ordered for the products on Amazon after reading about the torrid store experiences and got a healthy discount on the product as well. Have been using the 24K Deep Peeling for a few months and I have really loved the way it cleanses my skin. I really liked the fact that it actually exfoliated your dry skin cells and made your skin feel really soft and smooth. The other exfoliator I was using worked equally well, but it made my skin feel dryish. That&#x27;s why the deep peel was so wonderful for me. It offered the same results minus the dryness.     If you&#x27;re looking for products that help you enjoy a thorough cleanse, I would definitely recommend the Orogold Deep Peeling to you guys. It doesn&#x27;t cause any damage or harm to your skin and it is actually quite gentle on the face. Just ensure that your skin is dry before you apply the product.</li>
    <li> I really cannot believe the negative reviews that this product gets all the time. If you have an issue with the aggressive selling tactics, just order for the damn products online. I personally liked the Orogold store. Yes, they’re pushy, but who isn’t? I’m sure most of us in sales jobs are pretty much the same. Anyways, let me clarify that it isn’t something in the product that comes off. Its your dead skin cells. Use the product frequently and you’re bound to see that the amount of gunk sloughing off your skin reduces. How can you explain that if there was something in the product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New users – you might want to prepare yourselves for the Deep Peeling. The amount of dead skin  cells that the product sloughs off the first time you apply it is just crazy. It&#x27;s almost scary. But, look at your skin after using the deep peel and you will feel elated. The skin actually looks as if it is glowing because of the gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, I would request you guys to use the product before you give it negative reviews. I really liked the product and it certainly worked for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and absolutely love it!! I am an American Italian, so maybe it has something to do with our genes; or maybe the bad reviews are due to an allergic reaction to gold. .I give this product 5 stars, but do agree with the pushy sales persons.</li>
    <li> I was so sceptical at first when a salesman approached me at the mall. After the hard sale of $500 the salesman tried to push on me was quit insulting to say the least. I research everything and with sensitive skin, I am not one to purchase just anything. This Product is a great rejuvenator for tired dead skin that lie above the surface of your skin. It leaves your skin baby soft and smooth. I highly recommend this product for those that need that extra maintenance as I do pushing over 40. You will be very pleased with the result. The best place to buy this product is here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after high sales pressured at the Copley Square store in Boston. I used the peeling there and my skin felt good; however, after using it a few times more at home over the course of months, the area became excoriated, red and I had to see my dermatologist. He told me to stop using it. I would not recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin despite a high sales pitch that it will get rid of chapped dead skin areas. On top of that, they would not refund my money, not even partial.</li>
