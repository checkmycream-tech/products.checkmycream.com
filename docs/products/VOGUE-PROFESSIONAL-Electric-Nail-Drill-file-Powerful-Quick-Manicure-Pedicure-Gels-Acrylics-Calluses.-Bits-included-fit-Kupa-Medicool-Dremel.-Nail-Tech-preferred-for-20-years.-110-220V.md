<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was a abig step up from my former flimsy pink pen style nail tool. Works great. Love it! Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my one-tech nail spa and I love it. I don&#x27;t use the drill as much as some (prefer the blocks) but this does the trick.</li>
    <li> i wanted the manicurist for my home personal use.  It has worked perfect.  It surprised me how quiet it was.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it! It is great and really professional one!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Fits description of product and works beautifully! I would def recommend this, whether you are a professional or for at at home use!</li>
    <li> I LOVE MY DRILL PERIOD. Buy it, I HOPE THIS REVIEW HELP WITH SOME DECISION. I BEEN USING MY DRILL FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW AND IT DOES NOT HURT MY HAND NOR MY CLIENTS</li>
    <li> Omg i luv this lil machine its pretty powerful for being so small but it wrks great almost as good as the nail salon so if ur lookin for a good nail drill this is the one to buy its wrth the money i wuld recommend to ne one thatis lookin for a good nail drill... ;)</li>
    <li> been doing my own nails in between salon visits. time and distance is a factor for me.  Wish I had invested in it much earlier.  So much easier that using my Dremel tool.  So much more comfortable in my small hands,  DON&#x27;T WAIT!  it is so worth it.</li>
    <li> I just received my drill today and I was very excited about it, When I opened the box, I saw a BLUE drill.  I ordered purple.  The box said purple, but I got a blue drill.  I had decided not to send my drill back considering it&#x27;s not the color that makes beautiful nails, it&#x27;s the nail tech and I&#x27;m a nail tech and I need a drill.  The machine seems to work well and it did come with a few drills.  I just wish I got what I ordered in the color I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Pay closer attention customer service when you send something out, open the box and make sure it&#x27;s the proper item.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> So I just received this item and was sooo excited. It came quicker than I expected it to. I tried it out to see how well it works and it does the job. It is a lot lighter than I expected. The speed it can perform is awesome. Hey I guess I should put it like this, unless you plan on filing concrete this drill will work. I also was hoping to get the purple one and not the blue, luckily I did receive the purple one. Yay!! So yes I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> just like the ones the salons use. I love it! everything about it. it cut my nail time drastically.</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetology student and nails is my specialty. I love doing them and this machine makes doing them so much easier! It is smaller than the ones in the salon with the same amount of power. To me, it&#x27;s the perfect size, I totally love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want QUALITY on a budget, this is the way to go!&lt;br /&gt;Theres no reason to spend more for a drill that does the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and super quick shipping! Ordered on a Monday and received it on Wednesday (-: Comes from Northridge, California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT!</li>
    <li> It skips even on the lowest setting &amp; the lowest setting is to fast!</li>
    <li> This is a great drill at a great price. Works great for all nail purposes I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> Awesome drill. Very durable and dependable.</li>
    <li> I liked it because it was light but the power on it is not like the one you see in the nail salon.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it!! I do my own nails at home and it&#x27;s so much easier and faster with this nail drill.</li>
    <li> as a nail tech  i often am called on set  this  drill is  perfect !!! It&#x27;s powerful and quite&lt;br /&gt;its portability is  really its selling point .&lt;br /&gt; I will have  to buy a new one just to have on hand in the case of an emergency.</li>
    <li> This is one STRONG file! The lowest setting does the job really well. Be careful with it though. If you turn it up too high, it will burn like mad.</li>
    <li> Used for 2 weeks and reverse stopped working. I was hoping for atleast 2 months. I will try for a replacement</li>
    <li> It is very powerful so be careful and enjoy...and also a great price.  Need I say more.. I also bought the portable one and that too is a good choice.</li>
    <li> Oh I dont know what to do with out this! Is amazing! And very good price!</li>
    <li> I bought this item and received it on July 5,2012. I used it just 4 times and it stopped working. While in the middle of doing my nails  I turned it off to put it down. When I went to turn it back on the was no power. I ever tried plugging the drill in a different outlet. Today is July 23,2012 and already I&#x27;m returning it. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> My husband has toenail fungus, and we pay $40 just to get his toenails trimmed at the clinic so we decided to get this one so he can do it on his own out in the backyard. Its well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this to file my nails thinn since I got fungus that I&#x27;m trying to get rid off. In order for topical medication to work on your toes the nail plate needs to be as thinn as possible. I use to work with a podiatrist and we used drills like this one so far the speed is good and does the job, but just be careful to make speed to strong I would start out slow until you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> No issues so far. It was packaged in foam and in a larger box with other items. No damage. Works fine out of the box. I like that you can control the speed of the drill with a knob. It doesn&#x27;t come with any bits suitable for buffing so I&#x27;m just ordering those separately and checking the local beauty supply store to figure out which buff bit is best suited for my needs. Vogue does make a separate buffing kits for about 20$.</li>
    <li> i love it its very light just be careful not to drop it. i already have one from here and they both are great and do they job</li>
    <li> This drill is terrible, it worked for a few months and now the output for doesn&#x27;t even work. I now regret not spending a little bit more and getting an industrial grade nail drill. My recommendation, spend a little bit more and get a droll that&#x27;ll last longer than a few months.</li>
    <li> It is tiny but fierce. I thought it would be bigger so when I first seen it I felt like a disappointed bride on her honeymoon night. However, it had been marked down so that made the size alright. Had I paid 60 or 70 bucks I would have been pissed. It gets hot really fast so I would not recommend it for any professional even with a small amount of clientele. One good Easter or Mother&#x27;s Day weekend might kill it. Nevertheless, it serves well the purpose for which I intended,. ME! May I never lose a whole day again sitting in a Salon, be it Mother&#x27;s Day, Easter or Floyd Mayweather fight. Amen</li>
    <li> Vogue professional works great!  Just what I needed. Use it on my fingernails and toenails.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work real cheap wouldn&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> This electrical file was a waste of money, without any warning it just stop working!. I would not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my drill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Low on noise and works well.&lt;br /&gt;  Easy to grip/hold&lt;br /&gt;  Doesn&#x27;t heat up or get to hot&lt;br /&gt;  Rewind/Reverse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Bits don&#x27;t fit well&lt;br /&gt;  Implements get stuck</li>
    <li> I love it, what can I say. I received my order 3 days after ordering it. It arrived very will packaged and works wonderful. Very powerful and easy to use. Love how you can adjust the speed as well as the direction In which it rotates. Very happy with my purchase and definitely recommend this nail drill.</li>
    <li> This is not worth the money i used it about a dozen times and the motor blew!!! I thought i was getting a good deal !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected but it works good enough for what I need it to work for.  I would look into others rather than taking an okay one.  I regret this purchase, but not enough to battle for a refund.  I&#x27;ll use it, but not frequent. :(</li>
    <li> As a retired licensed nail technician, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product! I was equally surprised at the price as well; it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, has the necessary bells and whistles and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
    <li> First, got the package in 4 days. My friend told me to get it since she have one for over 6 years and never had a problem. She bought it for $100. She was so right. I love it. The only difference between my friend&#x27;s and mine is that I pay $50 less.</li>
    <li> Works really well for a great price! As a nail tech for over 25 years, this works a lot better than I can hope for.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected. Have used it a few times and it performs as expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my personal use at home. I still have to get my head around how to use the different attachments, but it&#x27;s certainly worked for polishing my nails, so far.</li>
    <li> It vibrates which makes it uncomfortable for my client.  Don&#x27;t buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I just started doing my own nails; so this drill was perfect because it gets the job done well, and it was cheap. The sand paper bits are hard to get off, but its possible. Other than that it have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I do my own acrylics at home, and this is a very quiet and effective tool.  I tried and returned a couple of others at the local beauty supply store and found this one on line.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> It is came as a better performance than I had expected.  I am very please with this device as doing manicures and pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;which I usually do every so often. It involves only a small amount of energy to perform a normal manicure or pedicure.  I also recommend getting those suggested components; grills and sanders.</li>
    <li> no vibration long enough mandril cord and power cord</li>
    <li> The hand piece stopped securing my drill bit so it falls out all the time. I have only had it for 2 months! Will never buy it or recommend it. Vibrates aggressively and is very loud.</li>
    <li> I received this product in a very prompt manner and was super excited to use it to do my acrylic nails. I got through my first hand just fine, worked great and then I got to my secound hand and it started shorting in and out with power. I think it has to do with the connect on the bottom of the drill but I dont have confidence that this drill will hold up for very long.</li>
    <li> I am very very satisfied with my item.  I purchased it be ause the reviews were good and I agree</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. Great for doing my acrlyic nails.</li>
    <li> We bought 2 of these for use in our salon. Within the first month one had already stopped working. The second one was dead one month later. I do not recommend this drill to anyone!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love my e-file, it&#x27;s the perfect balance for me between the &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; types for home use that don&#x27;t have any torque or an adjustable speed, and the big name professional brands like Kupa, etc. that are just way out of reach for a &amp;#34;nail enthusiast&amp;#34;, even if I do friends and relatives&#x27; nails. I did have a &amp;#34;nail machine&amp;#34; years ago, and I wouldn&#x27;t bother again, they aren&#x27;t much use for anything but buffing. This takes 3/32 standard bits, so I was able to buy a couple of extra mandrels for sanding bands, which saves changing back and forth for different grits--very convenient. I haven&#x27;t needed to buy any other additional bits, since I don&#x27;t do acrylics anymore due to allergies, but to work on acrylic nails optimally, a few additional bits would be needed. This machine could not accommodate a foot pedal to adjust the speed, even if you wanted to buy one additionally. It is small enough to unplug and move from room to room, or put in a little box or bag and easily take with you for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the best things &amp;#34;My Manicurist&amp;#34; does is to easily reduce the topcoat from soak-off-gel polish, shortening its removal time; remove soak-off-gel polish without acetone by gentle filing alone when appropriate; quickly perform the tedious roughening of plastic nail tips so that products like UV gel will stick to them, and contour and smooth the gel or silk wrap over tips to extend or natural nails to protect them.</li>
    <li> excellent product, Great price</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last two weeks!😤</li>
    <li> It does everything i expected from a professional machine. I saves me going to the podiatrist to grind my nails and my wife loves it as well.</li>
    <li> I read reviews and ended up with this one.  I love this drill! Everyone in my nail tech class loves it too!</li>
    <li> I use this on my two autistic sons! Minimal vibration! Unit seems well built! Came very well packaged and shipping was fast! I get their nails done quick without the fussing I got with Emory boards. Very happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this machine; after, using it three times, it stopped working.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but it&#x27;s not as sturdy as I thought. Very lightweight and the bits are not as heavy as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Is cute and handy, but is very flimsy , not well made, the control box fell apart after few weeks, the hand-piece pause less than five months,  I was very happy at the beginning , but now I am very disappointed, is OK for personal use, but not recommend for professional, won&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I am loving this drill.  It&#x27;s quiet, and virtually vibration free.  Being able to change the direction of rotation is wonderful, especially if you do your own nails!  So far I can&#x27;t fault it on anything and I have owned many drills over the years including a very expensive dental drill which did work amazingly well but honestly this little drill does just as good a job and is easier to manipulate.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Great machine for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister-in-law.  The first one was defective and I sent it back and got another one and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Received it 1 day late but that was okay. Easy to assemble and works great! Even used it on my dog with a separate accessory piece of course.</li>
    <li> I really like the way it works, but you cant do to much because it gets hot quickly.</li>
    <li> Was a little disappointed in bits, but is pretty piwerful., probably worth what I paid for it.</li>
    <li> This machine was perfect for trimming my callous and bunion.</li>
    <li> This drill has great power. Steady control and does what I need. I use for acrylics. Lightweight but not cheap</li>
    <li> Usable but like most home products like this, just not of the highest quality.  After two uses, the sandpaper files have lost the original quality!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t look for any other type to use. I have tried others and they fail to hold up to the work i put them though. and the price is really good and keeps me from having a bulky drill hook up to my table.</li>
    <li> This drill is perfect , I&#x27;ve used it for home use as well as using it to do a couple of other peoples nails . Works great , I like the small compact size, the different speeds are great ! I defenatly recommend :) oh but word of advice. You might want buy extra file bits. This one only comes with 5</li>
    <li> i liked this machine for my first one....i just have difficult time pulling the bits out......other then that the rest of the product is great...thanks</li>
    <li> This is a great drill for nails if you are looking to not spend a ton of money on a drill.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this item. I am no professional, I got this so I am able to do pedicures and manicures. It works just as good as the ones in the shop. It is not cordless so if you are looking for one that you just charge and go this is not for you. However, the cord is long enough where it does not bother me at all. Not to mention that it is easy to set and control your speed in both reverse and forward direction. I have only used the ones that you get from KMart or WalMart, maybe even Sally&#x27;s aying no more than ten dollars. I asked my nail tech and she was impressed with this equipement as well. It also comes with a nice warranty. I know that if you purchase this item you will enjoy it as well.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars b/c I got mine in 3 days and works amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first nail drill (I am a beginner) and I  am so happy with it that I even keep it at a low speed b/c it works so well. I was having such a hard time choosing in a nail drill and I am thankful I listened to all the wonderful reviews. Definitely recommend and I will be purchasing a second one just to have :)</li>
    <li> This item is good, I&#x27;m a nail tech student right now, but it is good for at home use or practice. It goes really fast just like to the professional ones, and comes with a few bits and everything. I liked it a lot. And the shipping was great and really fast. I got it the first day within time limit, probably would of got it delivered faster if but the post office was on a Monday. Great job ! Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> I just bought it and it stopped working</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying my new drill... Has great power,compact and quiet :) Highly recommend for the price! Found this same drill in Los Angeles in a manicurist \\&quot;outlet\\&quot; store and it was $128!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful little efile.  quiet holds its speed and great control. the handpiece is light and comfortable and holds onto the bit with no slipping. great buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s goes the job I need for home use.I wish I have gotten the on and off switch on the wand.</li>
    <li> This manicure machine is truly amazing. Really more than I need but could not pass up the price..The speed is completely adjustable plus it goes forward and reverse! It came with several basic implements but I ordered more (also from Amazon) I really</li>
    <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t think any of the drills that are on the cheaper side on Amazon would be what I was looking for. But this drill is fantastic. I spent weeks debating on which one i should get; one with a foot pedal that came with a lot of pieces (lots of bits, lots of sanding bands etc) or this one which is an actual name brand product that didnt come with much. I went with this and I&#x27;m so glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 6 sanding bands. 5 different bits, 2 of them diamond bits. It&#x27;s great. They all fit perfectly. It&#x27;s a nice color. It doesn&#x27;t vibrate wildly. And my favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t stop when you apply pressure to it. Which was really the only thing I was worried about because I can always order different bits and sanding bands. Although the ones that came with mine are working great.&lt;br /&gt;It shipped to my house in 3 days. It was packaged nice and safe so nothing can ruin it while being carried through the mail.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my first pedicure drill. Have used it twice now. Would give it a 5 * if the drill bits locked into place and had instructions about the drill bits. If push in too far can be a little tricky to get out. Even appeals to the guys. My boyfriend finds it a really cool gadget and gave me a better pedicure than I would at a salon. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> On the slowest speed it runs to fast.</li>
    <li> I just got my drill in the mail, and it got here 3days early. It&#x27;s compact and comes with some bits to start off with. I&#x27;m very happy with this product in terms of it actually doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, my only qualm is a few of my bits keep gettin sort of stuck...and the husband has to remove them for me :p other than that it works and is not meant to be pressed up against the nail/ acrylic too hard...  I like it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Mrs. H~</li>
    <li> Works great! Fairly priced! Would recommend. Box for different bits needs to be able to snap closed so everthing doesn&#x27;t fall out.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this item and would strongly recommend to anyone who does there own acrylic nails. Wonderful product, love the bits it came with, love the speed control. I could not be more satisfied with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this drill to cut down time while doing my own nails. I am not a professional nail tech, I just do this because I enjoy it. This drill is easy to use. I don&#x27;t know how other drills feel but it&#x27;s light and fits well in my hand. I have  had  no technical issues and have used it every week for about a  month.  I am very happy with my purchase and all  the bits that it came with.</li>
    <li> This item looked cheap and when I received it, it didn&#x27;t even work. I had to return and spent the extra money for a name brand, which I should&#x27;ve done in the first place.</li>
    <li> Very good purchase, Quiet and effective, quality if you are on budget. comfortable and easy to use, I will def recommend to a friend :-)</li>
    <li> It is a good nail file for beginners to professionals,i recommend this electric file!</li>
    <li> Have been a nail tech for 20+ years, and my last Kupa drill expired and paid 3x as much!  I am so impressed with this drill.  Very quiet, powerful, no foot pedal and light weight adapter.  Cannot go wrong for less than $50.00 and included some drill bits.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> For beginners this is a great E File. Especially if they really don&#x27;t take care of it. It does its job and it works great.</li>
    <li> I received the drill in the mail very fast. However I took it brand new out of the packaging plugged it in and turned it on and nothing happened. I started moving the cord around to find it had a short and was put together very cheaply. I returned it before I even had the chance to use it. very poor.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a drill I could use in between manicures to clean under my nails and to do my own pedicures on occasion.  I get the UV French Gel manicure and since my nails have a natural curve to them when they grow out in between getting the fillings done the edges of the natural nail become more prominent and apart from not being aesthetically pleasing to look at, they also occasionally catch/snag on clothing.  I am very picky about my hands being clean and for me the underside of my nails needs to look as clean and as nice as the top.  I wanted the kind of drill that my manicurist uses so I could really clean under the nail in between visits.  Also, I sometimes do not have time to spend at the salon for both a pedicure and filling so I occasionally need to do my pedicure myself.  I find a good sturdy drill with adjustable tips is easier to manage than a nail file on my toes.  I only just got the drill and used it once but I do love it.  I did take off one star because the picture on Amazon shows the unit as purple and the actual color is a dark blue.  While in this particular case, this issue will in no way affect the performance, I feel that accurate pictures and descriptions are very important because other than the reviews, these are the two main pieces of information people require in order to make a decision of what to buy.  How many people would buy something if there was no picture showing what the item looked like?</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife who wanted to start doing her own nails. She uses it weekly  Sometimes multiple times a week. It continues to get the job done,  she lives it and has had no complaints. And she&#x27;s recommended it to a few friends as well.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Provides multiple tips and sanders</li>
    <li> I bought this drill for while I was in school. Another classmate also bought one. Its a great drill for what your paying, and it&#x27;s great for while your in school, or just doing your own nails. Now, I had to replace mine because it had an electrical short where the hand piece plugs into the base. I purchased the drill in July 2013 and noticed the short around November 2013. My friends drill developed a crack in the hand piece and eventually the plastic covering where the bits go in came completely off, it still worked though. Now these drills did get backed up and carried to and from school 5 days a week for about 5 months. So here are the pros and cons...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-The price. I mean come on 50-60 bucks, awesome.&lt;br /&gt;-It looks nice and professional&lt;br /&gt;-Compared to drills of similar price, and even some that are more pricey, it is quieter.&lt;br /&gt;-It works great, gets the job done&lt;br /&gt;-Perfect for in school or personal use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Short term drill, or for minimal use&lt;br /&gt;-Breaks easily&lt;br /&gt;-Lots of vibration, which can be an issue with older clients or people who are sensitive&lt;br /&gt;-NOT FOR PROFESSIONAL USE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it and like I said great for the price. Once your ready for a professional drill, I highly recommend Primo Electric File. It&#x27;s amazing, really made me realize how much vibration the Vogue actually had. And the Primo is only 175 bucks, free shipping.  Hope all this helps. Happy filing lol</li>
    <li> This item is great .. 5 Stars !!!</li>
    <li> I had a machine similar to this in 2002 whe ni was working in a salon in MD. Somewhere it was lost and this is the replacement. The item I recieved is exactly as shown and exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> I used it once so far, really don&#x27;t know what tips I&#x27;m suppose to be using, The product arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> no problems here at all.</li>
    <li> Love!!! This product is good quality and achieves what I expected</li>
    <li> Item was damaged now im forced to send back for a refund. Not very happy.</li>
    <li> AMAZING !!!, THANKS AMAZON...</li>
    <li> This Drill is amazing! Very light hand piece, easy to use, love the color! Has a wide range of speed! At first I had a hard time getting the bits in, (I have weak wrists maybe that&#x27;s why) so I had my husband do it and now I can with ease but still tightly and securely so I think it just needed a bit of &amp;#34;breaking in&amp;#34;. I would absolutely recommend this! My nails look flawless and took a lot less time then hand filing! Love Love Love!</li>
    <li> Well so far so good! My customers love the smooth vibration, and I love the speed changes. It&#x27;s a wonderful product</li>
    <li> I NEVER write reviews, but I feel this product deserves all the raves one person can give.  I have been doing my own nails since learning from my friends going to nail school since the 90&#x27;s.  I have tried other cheaper drills just to be disappointed with the lack of power to smooth out my nails.  I like mine thin and as real looking as possible.  I also bought pro gold carbide bits that do the job perfectly without over grinding or getting too hot.  For beginners, start on the low setting until you get used to the power behind this drill. It has minimum vibration and I can still hear the tv over it without having to turn it up!!!  I wish i could give it 10 stars.  AMAZING!</li>
    <li> this does a great job and at the lowest speed.  Perfect for in-between appt. I can wait till every three weeks now.</li>
    <li> Just starting out, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton if money. Nice drill, easy to use. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> great drill and great price</li>
    <li> Works great!  Had a few others and this one fits well in my hand,  which is on the smaller side.  I would definitely recommend this product to nail techs.</li>
    <li> Worked one time, then the motor gave out.</li>
    <li> I got my packages a few days ago.. It was exactly what was advertised, works like a real professional nail drill. I LOVE IT.. Great for beginners.</li>
    <li> Mom was given this for a Xmas gift, said it worked great.  She uses it on acrylic nails.  Dad was happy because it saved $ from nail appointments!</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully!! Have been using it for about 4 months now and I love it!!</li>
    <li> Works great, like it a lot.  Comes with a lot of different interchangeable heads for any job and nail finish.</li>
    <li> The first hand-piece stopped spinning when pressure was applied. This company sent me an entire new unit which I returned as packaged, in a BAG INSIDE A SHIPPING BOX WITH ZERO PROTECTION. This resulted in poor customer service skill and I was accused of stealing the returned unit along with items that were never included, even though I have an email they sent proving they got it back. I took photos thankfully. I wouldn&#x27;t work with this company if they were free. I ended up having to buy a second hand piece from a different site and now the unit wont even turn on. I used it in my salon for 3 weeks on maybe 2 clients per day average, and it should not be malfunctioning. The power cord is defective, when you touch it it turns on and off and wont keep constant power. The biggest waste of my money and my time.</li>
    <li> This set is so simple to use and its so easy to control. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this one because I was going buy a similar one at $149.98, its a freaken deal! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I got in on time. It works well and I haven&#x27;t hard any problems wit it. No regrets its worth the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it had a lot of good reviews well I received it the next day after I ordered it and I used it the same day it worked fine until a month later when I went to use it again and it no longer worked I called the store I purchased it from and I have emailed them as well and I have not got a response from them yet it has now been over two months and I have a non working drill  DO NOT BUY !</li>
    <li> the control box has many issues I have had the reverse go out and yes they replaced it but the replacement I got worked for awhile and now the port for the power cord fell into the machine. I clean and disconnect the cords from it after every use but went to plug it all in to use it today and this is what I saw. Guess I am screwed no power port to plug into the wall !</li>
    <li> This product is very helpful for the star as a manicure or nail technic however there&#x27;s something that for some reason and i dont use it that much because am just staring my nail Varrie but it get bot on ghe handle and stop running, also i think that if it has a lityle more speed itwould be better. Other wise the product is ok.</li>
</ol>
