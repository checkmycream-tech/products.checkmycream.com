### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I think it is the perfect razor.</li>
      <li>Amazon appears to have the best deal.</li>
      <li>These razors are the best ones I can find for my skin.</li>
      <li>Just the best shave you can get!</li>
      <li>This is a great razor and gives you best bang for your buck if you buy it from Costco.</li>
      <li>Great deal.</li>
      <li>This is a great price for 12 of them.  </li>
      <li>I subscribed to three of these for the men in my family, and they were all very appreciative.</li>
      <li>How wonderful, how magical that would be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Keep up the good work.</li>
      <li>I find no improvement over dual blades with this one, good thing I still have an Atra.</li>
      <li>I get a really good shave out of them.  </li>
      <li>Great product and even better value.</li>
      <li>Some say the razor smiled</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re the most cost effective shave</li>
      <li>You could probably use them more</li>
      <li>To me, they&#x27;re much better than the disposable Sensor 3 which I don&#x27;t care for at all anymore.</li>
      <li>(I sure can&#x27;t find it).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>but I am scared that I will introduce more cuts.</li>
      <li>my wife also uses them to shave her body hair :)</li>
      <li>These are one of the items I get requests for most often from the troops we have \\&quot;adopted\\&quot; through [..]</li>
      <li>I have one of the most sentitive faces and many blades just irritate or nick me.  </li>
      <li>better than this though is</li>
      <li>A smooth and silky shave!</li>
      <li>but this is a better price</li>
      <li>I am glad I did.  </li>
      <li>Nay, this was indeed -- a Magic</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had for many years.</li>
      <li>The razors work nicely, are good for more than one use, and are relatively inexpensive.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They work best on the face, however they can be used to whack hair off other body areas as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I recently purchased the CustomPlus 3 and it is not as good (more is not always better)</li>
      <li>these are the best by far and I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It worked fine.</li>
      <li>My wife found these work fine as well.</li>
      <li>He set the razor aside just in case, on the slimmest hopes there could be another smooth shave.</li>
      <li>The man felt his smooth skin and wondered if it could be.</li>
      <li>it smooth guys and gals.</li>
      <li>Just called Gillette Customer Service they say the original is still in stores</li>
      <li>These are the first \\&quot;regular\\&quot; razors my son has used and both of us have very sensitive skin, but they gave us a good close shave without any irritation.</li>
      <li>It might even have ended that day, if the rough-bearded man had thrown the special razor in the trash.</li>
      <li>one day it was the special razor&#x27;s turn.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was all true.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first shave was fine, a nice close shave that didn&#x27;t sting that sensitive face.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really not that good.  </li>
      <li>These little buggers do the job for a nice, close, clean, comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can get right now.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The rough-bearded man with the sensitive face smiled a wide smile with his smooth skin.</li>
      <li>may just go back to the less espensive Good News it is better than</li>
      <li>first thing that I noticed was that these razor&#x27;s don&#x27;t glide on my skin like the Mach3.</li>
      <li>Love this product, it lasts for multiple uses.</li>
      <li>sensitive skin model does not give a close shave at all compared to original that was around since 1994.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>And the rough-bearded man lifted the special razor to his sensitive face.</li>
      <li>second shave was fine as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;But the fourth time he shaved his sensitive face with the special razor is when he began to suspect that this razor was special, indeed.</li>
      <li>Once again, I am buying extra landfill because the price difference is huge between Gillette﻿ disposables vs. cartridges.</li>
      <li>Unusual, thought the rough-bearded man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They only last for 2 or 3 uses at the most, but for the price it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Very convenient.</li>
      <li>I really like Gillette Razors.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>They last me two full shaves of my face and head; coarse beard, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>The razor&#x27;s shape and grip were pleasant surprises (the former provides easy access to the hard to reach places and the latter just makes shaving easier).    </li>
      <li>It was a lonely existence as the only one of its kind.</li>
      <li>In summary:    1) I shave every other day (work from home) and each razor easily lasts the week.    </li>
      <li>The Mach3 made my face feel so smooth and even after two passes with this razor, I still feel rough</li>
      <li>I normally drove to Wal-Mart to get them</li>
      <li>Exact same kind that I usually just get at Target, except I got them here for 1/3 the price.</li>
      <li>I normally use the Mach3</li>
      <li>As above: it&#x27;s final result is a smooth and comfy shave.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very sensitive</li>
      <li>The more expensive models haven&#x27;t proven to be any better or last longer, just cost more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>first of all when I actually do see them for sale at CVS</li>
      <li>first, the special razor lay in the bathroom drawer, watching as ordinary razors were used and thrown away, used and thrown away.</li>
      <li>new Sensitive Skin Custom Plus</li>
      <li>as the two blade original CustomPLus besides being more costly it tends to scrape and also the pivoting makes it hard to discern angles especially on the back neck.</li>
      <li>These are very light and hard to hold on to</li>
      <li>Second one single razor can last about 6-8 shaves even more sometimes...</li>
      <li>This product is hard to find like so many others.</li>
      <li>They tend to keep their edge very well after multiple shaves.</li>
      <li>Once upon a time in the Midwest, a rough-bearded man with a sensitive face bought a pack of disposable razors.</li>
      <li>These are so soft</li>
      <li>These Gillette \\&quot;CustomPlus 3\\&quot; disposable razors are made for sensitive skin and do work well, without causing irritation.</li>
      <li>Razors came and razors went as the tough-bearded man shaved his sensitive face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>All the other stuff that has come after the Mach3 is not really that much better</li>
      <li>The razor is comfortable due to only gliding over my face.</li>
      <li>The second use goes better if I completely dry the blade after the first, so that might be something to try if you have a coarse beard too and your razors start to wear down</li>
      <li>The only difference as far as I can tell, the color of the cartridge &amp; the lubrication strip.</li>
      <li>But attached to the outside of the pack of ordinary razors was one special razor, a sample of another razor model.</li>
      <li>I find 4 blades a little too much.</li>

<li> I tried this after a 3 day growth which isn&#x27;t a tough thick beard but a medium mostly gray one for me.</li>
<li> I buy every single on on the rack...</li>
<li> Not sharp enough for a moderately thick beard.  </li>
<li> I recently bought the 25 pack costing less than a dollar per razor from Costco.</li>
<li> Costco had these 26 for 25 bucks less a 5 dollar coupon so net 20.</li>
<li> because the really cheap-o two blade models typically don&#x27;t work well, don&#x27;t have a pivot head (which really sucks for shaving your head) or wear out after one use due to the additional passes required.  </li>
<li> so you have to be careful with these.</li>
<li> No real negatives at this point.  </li>
<li> Handle is slippery when wet.  </li>

    <li> Just called Gillette Customer Service they say the original is still in stores (I sure can&#x27;t find it).&lt;br /&gt;The sensitive skin model does not give a close shave at all compared to original that was around since 1994.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered 3 packs I received the new green package .\&lt;br /&gt;I may just go back to the less espensive Good News it is better than new Sensitive Skin Custom Plus</li>
    <li> Once upon a time in the Midwest, a rough-bearded man with a sensitive face bought a pack of disposable razors. The razors were ordinary razors, from Gillette. Those razors don&#x27;t come into this tale. But attached to the outside of the pack of ordinary razors was one special razor, a sample of another razor model. This is its story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, the special razor lay in the bathroom drawer, watching as ordinary razors were used and thrown away, used and thrown away. It was a lonely existence as the only one of its kind. No bright colors or fancy features made this razor stand out from the crowd. Razors came and razors went as the tough-bearded man shaved his sensitive face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day it was the special razor&#x27;s turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shave was fine, a nice close shave that didn&#x27;t sting that sensitive face. It might even have ended that day, if the rough-bearded man had thrown the special razor in the trash. But he didn&#x27;t, for he was frugal too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second shave was fine as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the third. Unusual, thought the rough-bearded man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the fourth time he shaved his sensitive face with the special razor is when he began to suspect that this razor was special, indeed. What razor stays sharp for four shaves? And a disposable too! The man felt his smooth skin and wondered if it could be. He set the razor aside just in case, on the slimmest hopes there could be another smooth shave. How wonderful, how magical that would be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day came, as they always do. And the rough-bearded man lifted the special razor to his sensitive face. And shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No pulling! No stinging! A smooth and silky shave! It was all true. Then the rough-bearded man knew that this was not merely a special razor. Nay, this was indeed -- a Magic Razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He asked the razor its name. The razor said, \\&quot;Gillette Custom Plus 3 Sensitive\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rough-bearded man with the sensitive face smiled a wide smile with his smooth skin. Some say the razor smiled too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The End</li>
    <li> I bought these at CVS because they were on sale. I normally use the Mach3 but they weren&#x27;t on sale so I decided to give these a try. I thought that these couldn&#x27;t be that much different but I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I noticed was that these razor&#x27;s don&#x27;t glide on my skin like the Mach3. I get annoying nicks and scrapes with this razor and they are a pain to deal with because they take a few days to heal. I also don&#x27;t feel these are cutting as close as the Mach3. Sometimes I want to do a third pass but I am scared that I will introduce more cuts. The Mach3 made my face feel so smooth and even after two passes with this razor, I still feel rough areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always wash my face before I shave and use shaving cream and I still have a problem with nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying these again. I will either go back to the Mach3 or I will use the Schick Hydro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Mach3 since around 1999 and I think it is the perfect razor. All the other stuff that has come after the Mach3 is not really that much better IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend these blades.</li>
    <li> The rubber piece makes the razor catch on your face even with generous shaving cream causing the worst cuts (not merely nicks) I have ever had. I&#x27;ve been shaving for 25 years and have never been cut this badly. I would never use the Gillette Custom Plus 3 again and would recommend against it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Well, I don&#x27;t like the newer Gillette razors, and this one is included. Shaving my face is like shaving a gorilla&#x27;s. The razor is comfortable due to only gliding over my face. The ones with off-set blades are the worst. I find no improvement over dual blades with this one, good thing I still have an Atra.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor and gives you best bang for your buck if you buy it from Costco. I recently bought the 25 pack costing less than a dollar per razor from Costco. Sadly, Amazon is not cheap destination anymore as it used to be. These are so soft my wife also uses them to shave her body hair :)</li>
    <li> These Gillette \\&quot;CustomPlus 3\\&quot; disposable razors are made for sensitive skin and do work well, without causing irritation. I picked these up while on a family vacation after both my son and I left our electric razors at home. These are the first \\&quot;regular\\&quot; razors my son has used and both of us have very sensitive skin, but they gave us a good close shave without any irritation. After using the same razor for three days in a row the blades are still sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> These are one of the items I get requests for most often from the troops we have \\&quot;adopted\\&quot; through [..] The razors work nicely, are good for more than one use, and are relatively inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I have one of the most sentitive faces and many blades just irritate or nick me.  These are blades I can count on not to shred my face.</li>
    <li> Once again, I am buying extra landfill because the price difference is huge between Gillette﻿ disposables vs. cartridges. And the thing is, I can pop the cartridges off the disposables &amp; use them on the metal Sensor handle I&#x27;ve had for many years. I just paid $25 for 26 of these at Costco﻿, vs. $21 for 8 cartridges! The only difference as far as I can tell, the color of the cartridge &amp; the lubrication strip. They both give me the same close shave.</li>
    <li> I relied 100% on user reviews to purchase these razors.  I am glad I did.  In summary:    1) I shave every other day (work from home) and each razor easily lasts the week.    2) The triple blades provide a shave nearly as close as the five blade system I was using (the latter became too expensive).    3) The razor&#x27;s shape and grip were pleasant surprises (the former provides easy access to the hard to reach places and the latter just makes shaving easier).    No real negatives at this point.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The blades are spaced far enough apart that the hairs from my head don&#x27;t clog the razor, even if I miss a few days.  And they pivot, a must for scalp work.</li>
    <li> This product is hard to find like so many others. Amazon appears to have the best deal. Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> Not sharp enough for a moderately thick beard.  Handle is slippery when wet.  Delivers a very poor shaving experience and will not recommend or buy again.</li>
    <li> These little buggers do the job for a nice, close, clean, comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work best on the face, however they can be used to whack hair off other body areas as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep it smooth guys and gals. OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will like them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these razors for a few years.  I have a very thick bear and I can use this type or razor twice before having to throw it away.  You could probably use them more but my face it&#x27;s very sensitive and I get bumps and red marks if I do.  This is a great price for 12 of them.  I normally drove to Wal-Mart to get them but this is a better price and I don&#x27;t have to drive anywhere to get them.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Schick equivalent three blade disposable to shave my face and head and it&#x27;s really not that good.  I had been using it though because the really cheap-o two blade models typically don&#x27;t work well, don&#x27;t have a pivot head (which really sucks for shaving your head) or wear out after one use due to the additional passes required.  The more expensive models haven&#x27;t proven to be any better or last longer, just cost more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found these and they&#x27;re the most cost effective shave I can get right now.  They last me two full shaves of my face and head; coarse beard, fine hair.  I get a really good shave out of them.  The second use goes better if I completely dry the blade after the first, so that might be something to try if you have a coarse beard too and your razors start to wear down quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better than this though is sometimes I can find these things in 20 packs at Sam&#x27;s Club or Costco for even less than the Amazon price.</li>
    <li> I have never cut myself, or gotten a razor burn from using these. Just the best shave you can get!</li>
    <li> These razors are the best ones I can find for my skin. I find 4 blades a little too much. They only last for 2 or 3 uses at the most, but for the price it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Does the job , but wayyyyy to expensive for the task it preforms.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the CustomPlus 3 and it is not as good (more is not always better) as the two blade original CustomPLus besides being more costly it tends to scrape and also the pivoting makes it hard to discern angles especially on the back neck. In terms of quality of result the two iterations produce identical results.</li>
    <li> I subscribed to three of these for the men in my family, and they were all very appreciative. Very convenient.</li>
    <li> I really like Gillette Razors.  Even though these say they are disposable, I tend to use them for a few shaves.  They tend to keep their edge very well after multiple shaves.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it lasts for multiple uses. As above: it&#x27;s final result is a smooth and comfy shave. Well recommended for heavy beards as well.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I wanted to write a review on this razor... first of all when I actually do see them for sale at CVS I buy every single on on the rack... cause they are always sold out everytime I look for them. Second one single razor can last about 6-8 shaves even more sometimes... these are the best by far and I highly recommend. NO RAZOR BURN!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years! My beard is heavy so I need the blades not to move or pivot to cut my beard. Great product and even better value.</li>
    <li> Exact same kind that I usually just get at Target, except I got them here for 1/3 the price. I don&#x27;t know if it was a sale. But I like these razors.</li>
    <li> I use them for my face, wife uses them for her legs.  To me, they&#x27;re much better than the disposable Sensor 3 which I don&#x27;t care for at all anymore.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I have used the metal handle with disposable blades. Costco had these 26 for 25 bucks less a 5 dollar coupon so net 20. Great deal. Blades are 50 bucks for 24 blades which doesn&#x27;t make sense environmentally... I tried this after a 3 day growth which isn&#x27;t a tough thick beard but a medium mostly gray one for me. It worked fine. What I don&#x27;t like about these as as the metal handle is the grip and weight. These are very light and hard to hold on to so you have to be careful with these. My wife found these work fine as well.</li>
