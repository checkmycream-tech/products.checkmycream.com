      <li>/&gt;I liked it.</li>
      <li>my hair nice and</li>
      <li>It came out reddish brown, a really nice color.</li>
      <li>My mom has been dyeing her own hair for years</li>
      <li>Fast shipping very happy, I got so many remarks on my hair .</li>
      <li>Palty has a chemical floral smell which is light and somewhat pleasant.</li>
      <li>The best part about dying with this -- soft hair afterward.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I was expecting for more &amp;#34;red-ish&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Regarding the color, it&#x27;s a nice warm looking light brown.</li>
      <li>I noticed that it has a more orange tint as it fades rather than the reddish tint, but maybe that&#x27;s just my hair.</li>
      <li>Upon use, I was majorly pleased.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I now know that I would like to go to a more brighter or noticeable color.</li>
      <li>, maybe it&#x27;s my imagination, but I thought the color showed up better a couple of days</li>
      <li>Even the box was too adorable to throw out.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair.</li>
      <li>It came out as more lighter-tone brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
      <li>Palty Raspberry Macaroon worked well to my hair more than I expected!&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I am satisfied how my hair turned out:)</li>
      <li>I let the dye sit in my hair for an hour and the color came out pretty good.</li>
      <li>love the product...hope the color more reddish, then will be super!</li>
      <li>It was the first time dyeing my own hair and it was actually incredibly easy!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great dye that&#x27;s definitely worth the money, but the color wasn&#x27;t quite right for me, a bit too light.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>This dye had a really nice, gentle smell that didn&#x27;t get me high and thinking I was Jim Morrison like the Clairol Perfect 10 I normally use.</li>
      <li>(1) box should be fine; just remember to keep it in your hair for a longer period.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Weeks after using this product (nearly two months now I think?), the reddish color has faded a bit, but it&#x27;s still a lovely warm brown.</li>
      <li>I have dyed my hair many, many times with professional salon dyes.</li>
      <li>the color turned out quite light indoors appearing almost like the lower right hand example in pictures.</li>
      <li>The color is really pretty!</li>
      <li>I was really hoping for the before mentioned color, but the shade I ended up with complimented my complexion just fine.</li>
      <li>This not work good with me my hair very dry when am use this one but color nich just not g</li>
      <li>is probably my favorite in this line thus far.</li>
      <li>I freaked out at first because that was not what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>, sure I definitely recommend this dye!</li>
      <li>I ventured out into hair coloring for the first time ever.</li>
      <li>So to achieve the lighter brownish/reddish colors from the box -- the dye should be kept in for a bit longer (probably 40-45 min) but make sure to use a conditioning mask after since most asian dyes contain a tiny bit of bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The amount of product was about right even though I was really sweating it at first.</li>
      <li>The name: Since it&#x27;s japanese, obviously, everything sounds cute and good enough to eat.</li>
      <li>Nice rich color doesn&#x27;t last too long color starts fading after the first week.</li>
      <li>Still very even and pretty.</li>
      <li>The colors can be true to the box, depending on your natural hair color.</li>
      <li>I was pretty worried that it wasn&#x27;t a brand named Western brand, but forums told me this worked best with my dark Asian</li>
      <li>Color is beautiful but enough only for short hair.</li>
      <li>very</li>
      <li>color took very well</li>
      <li>fact that I didn&#x27;t have to bleach my hair for the color to come out as intense as it should be.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Delivery was so fast</li>
      <li>I left it in the whole night just to be sure, and it works pretty well, except for the chunks of brown left in my hair</li>
      <li>I love Palty dyes -- they are the only dyes I trust on my asian hair.  </li>
      <li>and there was uneven color distribution more noticeable around the midsection of my hair.  </li>
      <li>Make sure to buy two boxes if you have long hair as one will not be enough.</li>
      <li>In sunlight it looks like the upper right hand corner.</li>
      <li>I keep my hair a really dark golden brown and was worried I&#x27;d have auburn roots and dark ends, but I guess this has a bit of bleach in it because it evenly dyed my hair a lovely reddish (but not brassy) medium brown.</li>
      <li>After dying it with Palty, it completely evened out the color of my hair making it one even color!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not strong on the scent and easy to apply on the hair.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that you have to apply the dye uniformly EVERYWHERE, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with super light roots like mine.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really see any red tones to it like the after color pictures on the box shows.</li>
      <li>I was surprised the box didn&#x27;t get smashed.</li>
      <li>The only thing that really bothered me is that it stung my scalp and my ears and</li>
      <li>While the majority of my hair ended up a lighter brown compared to my natural color, my roots were reddish brown.</li>
      <li>(Though that&#x27;s my fault, since I forgot to dye the inner portion of my hair, because I have so much of it.)&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I dyed it medium brown using Palty&#x27;s Natural Brown bleach.  </li>
      <li>The Palty Turn Color Natural Brown</li>
      <li>/&gt;For those of you who want to &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; like I did, mix it in a 1:1 ratio, since that&#x27;s what the complete set comes as.</li>
      <li>I got a really pretty red from Palty and will definitely repurchase when my roots come in.</li>
      <li>One box was enough to cover my showing roots which grew about 5-6 inches and the second box was able to cover the rest of my hair and I had a little dye left over still.</li>
      <li>It also left my hair really soft after using the conditioner it came with.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very possible that the color will not turn out the way you imagined, but it shouldn&#x27;t be too far off</li>
      <li>I have brown hair with natural red highlights that is prone to be frizzy and somewhat wavy.</li>
      <li>However, if you have long or thick hair you&#x27;ll probably need two or more boxes.</li>
      <li>First, let me get this clear, I&#x27;m not asian with black hair.</li>
      <li>The only hair dye that works on my super black asian hair.</li>
      <li>This dye is no exception, BUT it is less intense than others.</li>
      <li>So I was afraid to dye it to be honest but this dye left my hair extremely silky and much healthier looking than it was before.</li>
      <li>I originally have deep, dark brown hair (appears black indoors)</li>
      <li>This is my first time using a Palty product - I think it does pretty well on my dark, thick Asian hair.</li>

<li> I am an Asian and has dark colored hair.</li>
<li> Regardless, it didn&#x27;t further damage my naturally thick, coarse, color-treated hair any further</li>
<li> I would definitely buy again and try the other colors!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This not work good with me my hair very dry when am use this one but color nich just not g</li>
    <li> Asian hair are not easy to change colors but this stuff works. It&#x27;s not strong on the scent and easy to apply on the hair. I recommend that if you have thick hair like mine, you would need to use two of these do the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for pretty packaging and snazzy names, so I ordered this to give it a whirl. Upon use, I was majorly pleased. This dye had a really nice, gentle smell that didn&#x27;t get me high and thinking I was Jim Morrison like the Clairol Perfect 10 I normally use. Seriously, that stuff kills brain cells, but I digress. I will warn you that when you get the box you&#x27;ll realize it&#x27;s several shades lighter than it looks on the internet. I keep my hair a really dark golden brown and was worried I&#x27;d have auburn roots and dark ends, but I guess this has a bit of bleach in it because it evenly dyed my hair a lovely reddish (but not brassy) medium brown. Regardless, it didn&#x27;t further damage my naturally thick, coarse, color-treated hair any further and I think the camellia treatment included actually gave it a nicer texture than it had before. The amount of product was about right even though I was really sweating it at first. If your hair goes past the bottom of your shoulder blades it might not hurt to get a couple of boxes instead of just one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great dye that&#x27;s definitely worth the money, but the color wasn&#x27;t quite right for me, a bit too light. The Palty Turn Color Natural Brown is probably my favorite in this line thus far.</li>
    <li> The color is just perfect and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair. I noticed that it has a more orange tint as it fades rather than the reddish tint, but maybe that&#x27;s just my hair.</li>
    <li> I ventured out into hair coloring for the first time ever. I was pretty worried that it wasn&#x27;t a brand named Western brand, but forums told me this worked best with my dark Asian hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weeks after using this product (nearly two months now I think?), the reddish color has faded a bit, but it&#x27;s still a lovely warm brown. I left it in my hair for 2 hours - yes, crazy, but after one &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; and a second &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; dyeing, I determined that my hair is way thicker than normal Asian hair. My hair is also still thick and healthy-ish except at the very ends of my hair since I haven&#x27;t cut it in like 7 months or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, maybe it&#x27;s my imagination, but I thought the color showed up better a couple of days afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who want to &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; like I did, mix it in a 1:1 ratio, since that&#x27;s what the complete set comes as.</li>
    <li> I love Palty dyes -- they are the only dyes I trust on my asian hair.  I originally have deep, dark brown hair (appears black indoors) but I dyed it medium brown using Palty&#x27;s Natural Brown bleach.  I then re-dyed it with Palty&#x27;s deep black...so before using this product my hair was black with some brown hi-lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, usually the dyes will lift dark hair color anywhere between 30 - 35min.  I left it in for 35 min and there was uneven color distribution more noticeable around the midsection of my hair.  Some parts were similar to the color on the box, but there were also dark sections.  So to achieve the lighter brownish/reddish colors from the box -- the dye should be kept in for a bit longer (probably 40-45 min) but make sure to use a conditioning mask after since most asian dyes contain a tiny bit of bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you have thick hair (shoulder length or longer) you will definitely need (2) boxes... but if you&#x27;re hair is already lighter in color (medium brown - blonde) (1) box should be fine; just remember to keep it in your hair for a longer period.</li>
    <li> The dye shipped and arrived at my home very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;The color took very well and I have dark Asian hair. Definitely get 2 boxes if you have long hair. Instructions said to leave it in for 20 minutes but I did 40 instead.</li>
    <li> I have really dark hair and all other boxed hair dyes never do anything to my color. I got a really pretty red from Palty and will definitely repurchase when my roots come in. Make sure to buy two boxes if you have long hair as one will not be enough.</li>
    <li> The color is really pretty! It smells horrible, but it&#x27;s easy to comb in and lightens dark hair easily and efficiently. However, if you have long or thick hair you&#x27;ll probably need two or more boxes.</li>
    <li> I have dyed my hair many, many times with professional salon dyes. Each time, there has been a very annoying burning and tingling sensation on my scalp. This dye is no exception, BUT it is less intense than others. The best part about dying with this -- soft hair afterward. The colors can be true to the box, depending on your natural hair color. If you have dark hair (I have dark brown), I would advise leaving it in a bit longer if you are going lighter. It&#x27;s very possible that the color will not turn out the way you imagined, but it shouldn&#x27;t be too far off the mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Jewelry Ash, expecting a brown with grey undertones. While the majority of my hair ended up a lighter brown compared to my natural color, my roots were reddish brown. How odd! I freaked out at first because that was not what I was expecting. After a few washes, the color matched the rest of my hair. I was really hoping for the before mentioned color, but the shade I ended up with complimented my complexion just fine. I was content. So, I will be buying Palty again.</li>
    <li> Nice rich color doesn&#x27;t last too long color starts fading after the first week. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type tho</li>
    <li> Color is beautiful but enough only for short hair.</li>
    <li> First, let me get this clear, I&#x27;m not asian with black hair. I&#x27;m white with frizzy/wavy/curly dark brown/brown-ish hair. I wanted my hair to be lighter with a tint of red in it, so I bought this dye, delighted by the idea that I wouldn&#x27;t have to turn into a peroxyded blondie before attempting any \\&quot;color magic\\&quot; with my tragic hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;- I left it in the whole night just to be sure, and it works pretty well, except for the chunks of brown left in my hair (Though that&#x27;s my fault, since I forgot to dye the inner portion of my hair, because I have so much of it.)&lt;br /&gt;- The name: Since it&#x27;s japanese, obviously, everything sounds cute and good enough to eat. Even the box was too adorable to throw out.&lt;br /&gt;-The fact that I didn&#x27;t have to bleach my hair for the color to come out as intense as it should be. (This was made with black-haired asians in mind, so the color came out a tad lighter on my brown hair.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;- the fact that I had to buy four packs of it to color my entire hair. I don&#x27;t blame them, because I have long hair past my hips, not many people are like that in Japan, except anime characters, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, sure I definitely recommend this dye!</li>
    <li> The only hair dye that works on my super black asian hair. Love it</li>
    <li> I have Asian hair, never dyed before. I left the product in for 20 minutes and my hair was a little darker than the color on the box. Still very even and pretty.</li>
    <li> Bought a John Frieda dye from Rite Aid and it didn&#x27;t work on my asian hair so I bought this dye as suggested from a friend. I was scared it wouldn&#x27;t work like the one from Rite Aid and so I left it in for an hour even though the box said to leave in for about 20 min(?). It came out reddish brown, a really nice color. I received a lot of compliments on it and will definitely buy from this brand again because it actually works on my hair!</li>
    <li> I am an Asian and has dark colored hair. Palty Raspberry Macaroon worked well to my hair more than I expected!&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was so fast and I am satisfied how my hair turned out:)</li>
    <li> The hair colour did not turn out like the box.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a Palty product - I think it does pretty well on my dark, thick Asian hair. You definitely need two bottles of this product if you have hair longer than shoulder length. It works just like any other hair dye: mix the two together, apply to hair, wait and rinse. I let the dye sit in my hair for an hour and the color came out pretty good. My only complaint is that you have to apply the dye uniformly EVERYWHERE, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with super light roots like mine. I would definitely buy again and try the other colors!</li>
    <li> love the product...hope the color more reddish, then will be super! will buy next time..for long hair, suggest buy two...</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Very nice color. Love it an has been used it for a while.</li>
    <li> I previously dyed my hair using American drugstore brands like Revlon and even the permanent dye by Garnier. My hair had different tones where you can see previous growth before dying. After dying it with Palty, it completely evened out the color of my hair making it one even color! I didn&#x27;t even leave it in for that long, ~20-25 minutes including the application time. One box was enough to cover my showing roots which grew about 5-6 inches and the second box was able to cover the rest of my hair and I had a little dye left over still. My hair is layered and ends just below my bust for reference. It also left my hair really soft after using the conditioner it came with. The only thing that really bothered me is that it stung my scalp and my ears and anywhere else the dye came in contact with. Also, I read online somewhere that if you leave it in longer than the recommended time, it can turn your hair gray. But you don&#x27;t need to worry because the hair dye does its job in 20 minutes. Regarding the color, it&#x27;s a nice warm looking light brown. I don&#x27;t really see any red tones to it like the after color pictures on the box shows. The instructions say to shampoo the dye out twice which is what I did so I feel like that may have washed out the color a bit.</li>
    <li> Works great ... Fast shipping very happy, I got so many remarks on my hair . I used to have black pur aznhair ... Now it like marroonish</li>
    <li> The color stayed, and the mix smelled really good! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Received the hair dye in good condition. I was surprised the box didn&#x27;t get smashed. I tried it out and it looks just as what the box described. I now know that I would like to go to a more brighter or noticeable color.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I was expecting for more &amp;#34;red-ish&amp;#34; color tone.&lt;br /&gt;I have Dark-brown/Black thin hair. It came out as more lighter-tone brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;Made my hair nice and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it.</li>
    <li> I have brown hair with natural red highlights that is prone to be frizzy and somewhat wavy. So I was afraid to dye it to be honest but this dye left my hair extremely silky and much healthier looking than it was before. It seems counter intuitive but it is probably due to the shine it has. It was the first time dyeing my own hair and it was actually incredibly easy! I left it on for 40 min since I was scared the color wouldn&#x27;t take....oddly enough...the color turned out quite light indoors appearing almost like the lower right hand example in pictures. In sunlight it looks like the upper right hand corner. It makes no sense but I guess it has to do with the type of lighting I have indoors. It&#x27;s also the best smelling dye I have ever smelled!!! My mom has been dyeing her own hair for years and I can&#x27;t stand the smell. Palty has a chemical floral smell which is light and somewhat pleasant. Also, when I washed it out (with cold water) I actually didn&#x27;t see any dye run off like I saw in forums featuring red hair dye issues. I am incredibly pleased!!!</li>
