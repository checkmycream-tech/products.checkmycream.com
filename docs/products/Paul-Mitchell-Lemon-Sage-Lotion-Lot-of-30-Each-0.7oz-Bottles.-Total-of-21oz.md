<li> my 2 year old granddaughter, she&#x27;s like her grandma and likes to have lotion on her hands.</li>
<li> my wife loves the cream, but there is very little in each bottle probably only half full.</li>
<li> I have extra dry skin on the back of my arms and this made it go away in two applications, ALSO it&#x27;s not a greasy lotion</li>
<li> Small bottle, so its very convenient to carry anywhere</li>
<li> Yet, on the other hand, I have difficulty completely emptying little bottles, therefore may not get all the product from the bottle.  </li>
<li> The order came when expected.</li>
<li> Mixed ratings on purchasing the small bottles:  </li>
<li> Tried some at a hotel I was staying&lt;br /&gt;at and track it down on Amazon.</li>
<li> She mixes a little bit of water with it or inside the bottle once halfway used up.  </li>
<li> Had been doing a lot of traveling, and had about 6 little sample bottles that the hotel gives with each stay.</li>
<li> Found it on Amazon and now take a few bottles with me whenever I travel.  </li>
<li> This does thin it out but also allows it to last longer.</li>
<li> You waste half the bottle!</li>
<li> The bottles are extremely stiff and you can&#x27;t squeeze the lotion out.  </li>
<li> The convenience of having a small bottle in your purse, in your car, at your desk, etc.  </li>
<li> They are small</li>
<li> to get out of the small tube.</li>
<li> Rubs in nicely, no oily residue and the scent is pleasing and not overwhelming.  </li>
<li> Seriously - there is nothing worse than that greasy feel on my hands and fingers.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m one of those weird people that hates lotion....</li>
<li> I HATE lotion.  </li>

    <li> Found this lotion at a Hyatt place I think and by the time I tried it, I instantly regretted not taking or asking for more xD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for the hands and leaves you skin very very very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and get a pack of these. And above all, the size it&#x27;s perfect you carry on the backpack or you handbag.</li>
    <li> A handy size to carry or give as a small gift.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing. I stayed at the Spring Hill Marriott in Michigan and this was the line of lotion that they had. I was able to get them to give me a couple of extra bottles, but I&#x27;m looking online to see if I could find some to buy, this is definitely one of the best lotions. I have extra dry skin on the back of my arms and this made it go away in two applications, ALSO it&#x27;s not a greasy lotion so it&#x27;s really nice. I will definitely be buying this and keeping this in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> I was on vacation in AZ. and the hotel we stayed at had this size of this lotion for their guests. It&#x27;s creamy and a nice citrus smell to it. When I got back home, I couldn&#x27;t find this product any where in any size. I asked my nail lady if she could see if any of the hair places she shops at has it. It don&#x27;t exist in my home town. I bought this bag of the 0.7 oz. bottles so I can let my 2 year old granddaughter, she&#x27;s like her grandma and likes to have lotion on her hands. I keep some in the car for when I&#x27;m out and about. Great stocking stuffers for those who could use that idea.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  Rubs in nicely, no oily residue and the scent is pleasing and not overwhelming.  The trial sizes are perfect for a pocket, a purse or at your desk.</li>
    <li> Came across this lotion at a recent hotel stay in Atlanta GA. It was stocked in our rooms daily. I love it so much I didn&#x27;t even use my personal lotion I&#x27;d brought with me. What I love about this lotion is the fragrance, lemons and sage. Yes, Yes, Yes.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a great lotion to bring with you everywhere then this is the guy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell and the feel after applying just a little of this.  They are small so I have some everywhere, Car, Work, Travel bag, Gym bag.  Now during the summer I always get my skin feeling smooth and no longer dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing my GF thought that it was too think.  She mixes a little bit of water with it or inside the bottle once halfway used up.  This does thin it out but also allows it to last longer.</li>
    <li> love it because it works. and I love the  smell of it. what longer review, what you want me to do, lie? I said it all, it work and smell good.</li>
