      <li>the price is cheap and the product is fair.</li>

      <li>It works good, great for short guy hair aswell.</li>
      <li>When I would straighten my hair I could hear my hair snapping and it would take me more than 5 mins to straighten my hair.</li>

      <li>/&gt;It heats quickly and straightens effectively.</li>
      <li>Love the flat iron works very good</li>
      <li>use all products on myself before I use them on a client (I do consultations and then the job in-home either at my house or the client&#x27;s, so everything has to be perfect), and this is honestly better than any other flat-iron I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>they get hot fast.very light to carry as well good on my hair</li>
      <li>It works pretty well, not as well as my $300 one, but for a 14 year old, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>This is a very good flat iron.</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron because it makes my hair look beautiful</li>
      <li>The flat iron is all that I needed , it is light and the heat is perfect for curl and straight  hair , I used the first time for my synthetic wig and it was very nice</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold.</li>
      <li>I think that this item is a very great find not only for what it is to used for but also for the very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>Feels sort of cheap and light</li>
      <li>Works great - my only issue with it is that it&#x27;s supposed to turn off after an hour just in case you accidentally leave it on, and it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Also it felt like it was tugging my hair and make a scratchy noise rather than a smooth one</li>
      <li>I used this iron with some colour-shield anti-frizz serum and the results were fabulous.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely cheap but gets the job done.</li>
      <li>do like its compact size and light weight.  </li>
      <li>But it is fairly light.</li>
      <li>nicely built, works really well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This iron is very good for the price and for hair that is not too think, no complaints on my end.</li>
    <li> The ceramic paddles are not sliding, just tangled in the hair, which damages, leaving brittle and looks creepy. The price is attractive, but the result is not the best.</li>
    <li> The plates don&#x27;t seem polished enough and snag my hair.  Since the plates are so thin and the edges aren&#x27;t rounded, I can&#x27;t use it to turn the ends of my hair under.  The iron doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough even on the high setting so I&#x27;m spending WAY too much time straightening my hair.  The cord attaches in the old-fashioned way to the device and doesn&#x27;t swivel.  I guess for the price, it was OK.  I&#x27;ll probably buy a nicer one and use this as a &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; hot iron.</li>
    <li> My sister in law loved it, she still uses it! I got it for her last Christmas. Really good straightener.</li>
    <li> Feels sort of cheap and light but it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Had to use on the highest setting for my hair, but it did an excellent job of straightening it once I cranked the heat up.</li>
    <li> The product is ok. It&#x27;s not as smooth as the ones with higher prices but is good enough.</li>
    <li> It works reaal good on my hair!😊</li>
    <li> I received this as a present for Christmas two years ago. It straightened my hair well, but it would snag on it. Straighteners with higher prices are better quality and don&#x27;t snag. And plus, the only temperature options are high and low. It seems as if this straightener is for very fine and very thin hair.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener heats up and straightens my hair just the way I want it. My only problem with it is that when I tried to curl my hair with it, the cord curled in on itself and now I can&#x27;t straighten it out!</li>
    <li> I purchased this when it was an add-on item and I am so glad I did! It is the cheapest straightener I have ever bought and it is now my favorite. The cord is a nice length so I don&#x27;t have to stand right next to an outlet while straightening. I am able to straighten my long wavy hair within twenty minutes. It heats up quickly and it is easy to store in my medicine cabinet because of how small it is.</li>
    <li> I like this flat iron but, unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for me. It only goes up to 350 degrees. but if it was hotter, this flat iron would be perfect other than that, it is worth buying, its not too heavy or anything.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely cheap but gets the job done. Hard to clean though so make sure you wipe it at the end of each use if you use product on your hair. It works for bangs really well! Pair it with hair spray when you&#x27;re done and you&#x27;re golden!</li>
    <li> I think that this is an error on my part. Maybe it did state that it only goes up to 350 but I assumed it would be hotter but it&#x27;s not. It takes 20 minutes to do my entire head but I do go over each section 2-4 times and I have short hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people with hair longer than shoulder length.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it works like a typical flat iron. Pretty straight forward. Works well and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Revlon is a brand I trust. I knew that I don&#x27;t have to buy the most expensive straightener to do the job, and I was right! This is a good brand.</li>
    <li> this product is ok. the price is cheap and the product is fair. I like the size of the straightener.</li>
    <li> My pre-teen absolutely loved this Christmas present.  She&#x27;s very happy with it, so I&#x27;ve got no complaints.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and the price was right.</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron works very good they get hot fast.very light to carry as well good on my hair I love them</li>
    <li> its good gets the job done</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s turn hot very quickly which saved a lot of time for me and it works very well for my hair.</li>
    <li> I think that this item is a very great find not only for what it is to used for but also for the very reasonable price.  I wold recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this little straightener ~ nothing fancy, for sure, but who needs fancy?  It gets the job done and actually exceeded expectations.</li>
    <li> The product is not a good flat iron for African American girls hair. So I would not use it anymore.</li>
    <li> Package arrived on time, and works great, heats up very fast and is very powerful. I recommend it especially for difficult hair.</li>
    <li> A little larger than I expected. I&#x27;m used to traveling with a smaller unit, but it does look and feel professional. Results just as they should be - with professional equipment. Great deal for the price. Still not sure why the price is so low.</li>
    <li> The finger grips get way too hot even on the low setting. Other than that I like it so far.</li>
    <li> Well Duh! But there are only three settings: high low and off. Dials are often preferred, this is a switch.</li>
    <li> I want to give a star review I just dont want to write alot  if I give it a 5 star review that means I love it and would recommend it. thank you</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I can also curl my hair with this. Love it :))</li>
    <li> This was perfect for what I needed. It does the job and its lasting for a long time. I&#x27;ve had it since last year</li>
    <li> Heats up really quick and does a great job straightening both mine and my moms frizzy unmanageable out of control hair. so glad I bought this and gave it to her before Christmas.</li>
    <li> It works good, great for short guy hair aswell. It heats up really fast, in less then 30 seconds, but takes forever to cool down , probably 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I needed a hair straightener but didn&#x27;t want to pay an arm and a leg for it, so I chose this one by Revlon. The price is great- I don&#x27;t know if you will find many other ceramic straighteners at such a deal- and for me it works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats quickly and straightens effectively. It is also thin, light, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For any potential buyers, I must say that I have thin, naturally straight hair, but if I don&#x27;t wash &amp; blow dry it every single day, it can get wavy, and also after I put it up in a pony tail, it creates a crease that I must straighten out. So for me, this product does exactly what I wanted it to do, but I can&#x27;t speak for people who might have thicker or curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(*Oh and in case of any confusion, I know my user name is &amp;#34;Mark&amp;#34; but I AM a female! I created this account under my boyfriend&#x27;s name but now I mostly use it for orders!)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d rate it a zero if they&#x27;d let me. This thing is horrible. I would whole heartedly advise against buying this. It did nothing close to straightening my hair, just made it staticy. No one likes static.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s a ceramic straightener, I never straighten my hair because it&#x27;s already straight but great for adding flips and small curls</li>
    <li> I had a flat iron before but it broke,so when i got this one i was extremely surprised when it heated up so fast! The low heats up to what my other one did on hot it was amazing! I was also surprised when reading all the reviews i wanted one but did not want one, and its so cheap but definitely worth it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great on my stubborn hair. Quick and easy to use and heats up very fast, and cools down very fast when turned off.</li>
    <li> after having this item for nearly a year now it is small but very powerful,&lt;br /&gt;styles hair great..can adjust the heat on it, everything they state on the website and more..love this straightener</li>
    <li> Heats very quickly and takes no time at all for simple locks! Takes maybe 5 minutes to do my hair. Great straightener!</li>
    <li> Never used a flat iron until I got this one--got it at the recommendation of my daughter in-law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently got the shortest hair cut I have ever had in my life because I was tired of spending hours curling my hair. I have very thick hair so it always took a long time to curl it with a curling iron--and now I am elderly and it bothers me to stand so long curling my hair. I wanted short hair so as not to have to curl it, and yet at the same time be able to have some wave to it. This is why my daughter in-law suggested a flat iron. She said I could also give it a little wave with the flat iron. This flat iron will do that. In the back of my hair, where it is the shortest, I simply use the flat iron as you normally would and it gives the back of my hair a smooth look. The sides and front of my hair is where I wanted a little wave. I have a hard time doing this because I need to touch the outside of the iron itself to help wind it around the hair, but the flat iron is hot all the way around, including the outside of it. If I don&#x27;t try to hold the outside of the flat iron then I can hardly wrap it around any hair and the hair turns out straight--no wave at all. If I could figure out a way to do this without burning my fingers I would love this flat iron and would give it a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> When I get up at 5 Am to get ready for high school, I love doing my hair and make up. I love this flat iron because it makes my hair look beautiful and so is the curling iron.</li>
    <li> Gets hot really fast.</li>
    <li> When I first got it I was exited, but when I first tried it out the excitment turned into disappointment. While straightening I noticed a funny smell coming from the flat iron and I could smell it when it first heated up. However, the smell did go away the second time I used it. Also, I feel this product does not do a good job straightening my hair. I often find myself going over and over a piece of hair (which is not good) and the piece still being wavy. I have tried low and high heat and both of them don&#x27;t entirely straighten my hair. I wish I could go back to my old straightener</li>
    <li> My older sister had this straightener, she recently bought a new one, so she passed this one down to me. It does straighten my hair pretty well, but when I get to the ends it feels as if it&#x27;s ripping my hair out. It would be even better if it can with a medium heat because low hardly straightens my thick hair, yet high occasionally fries the ends of my hair. But I wouldn&#x27;t worry about that because although my hair is very thick, it is also EXTREMELY fragile. Other then those small details this is a magnificent straightener. It is very easy to fit in small places yet large enough to get the job done quickly. It&#x27;s amazing. I would defiantly recommend this straightener to someone looking for a cheap, yet good straightener! (sorry it is so long)</li>
    <li> It does the job but doesn&#x27;t heat up quickly.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do. Purchased for a friend who needed a new straightener. Works well. Revlon is a good brand.</li>
    <li> This straightener works so much better than my 2 inch vidal sasson one, I am so happy I made this purchase! It heats up in only 30 seconds and I finish my hair so much faster than my previous straightener!</li>
    <li> As anyone who styles hair knows, bigger is not necessarily better when it comes to styling tools.&lt;br /&gt;I use all products on myself before I use them on a client (I do consultations and then the job in-home either at my house or the client&#x27;s, so everything has to be perfect), and this is honestly better than any other flat-iron I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long thick wavy hair, layered in the front, some fringe, that is extremely difficult to use tools on. The larger irons, no matter how expensive just don&#x27;t act as they are shown to; but I used this iron with some colour-shield anti-frizz serum and the results were fabulous. I sectioned my hair off and turned the iron to the highest heat, did small bunches at a time.&lt;br /&gt;You can even use this small iron to give slight curl to layers, and probably can add more curl, I just haven&#x27;t tried it myself and have have a separate tool for curling on clients after straightening.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work on my asian hair.</li>
    <li> I give this four stars for the price. This retails at 9.99 in Walmart. It takes more than 30 seconds to warm up, I would say it takes a minute to heat up. The hair does not glide nicely on the plates but what do you expect for ten dollars? This was purchased for my gym bag so I don&#x27;t need to lug around my Hot Tools flat iron. I use this iron just for my bangs. I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would want to use this on their whole head. Wish it came with a case.</li>
    <li> Basic straighter  basic quality good price works well pretty durable basic coloight weight easy to handle and stays cool to touch</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a flat iron that doesn&#x27;t smell like burning plastic when on, this one does that. Results wise, it was ok, I have thin frizzy wavy dry hair.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  This was inexpensive but it is so lightweight i&#x27;d rather pay more and get one that actually straightens my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it once and so far it&#x27;s been quite good. Heats up quickly and makes my hair straight and silky!</li>
    <li> So far I using it and I have no complain.....I like that it work so good for the price for that i give it four stars...</li>
    <li> I have straight hair, just wanted a mini iron to touch up any kinks if I wake up with bed head. This barely worked on my hair. Also it felt like it was tugging my hair and make a scratchy noise rather than a smooth one my old iron did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice that you can grip the ends for better hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am returning.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an Angel Tree gift and it came in a beat up, unsealed plastic bag! Definitely don&#x27;t buy this as a gift and only buy it for yourself if you&#x27;re brave, the packaging makes me think something is sketchy with this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cost effective and functions absolutely perfectly. Is completely worth a buy. Nothing much could be expected at such a cost.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for her birthday, and she really likes this straightener. It&#x27;s got finger grips, 2 simple settings, and is inexpensive. The straightener is nothing fancy, but it gets the job done and is simple enough that she didn&#x27;t have to refer to back of the box or ask me what settings to use.</li>
    <li> they ok, they get hot enough to use.  for the the price that was paid I&#x27;m satisfied.  I would recommend it if you don&#x27;t want to much heat.</li>
    <li> This flat iron gets the job done adequately. It&#x27;s nothing deluxe or exceptional, but it&#x27;s definitely more than worth the money. Convenient size and all. It&#x27;s a four star item, but it earns that fifth star with such a low price.</li>
    <li> This straightener works well.  I just wish it had an adjustable control for the heat setting.  Otherwise, it works very well.</li>
    <li> Great straightener. Gets really hot, glides through hair. I would suggest this to anyone considering buying it. Can&#x27;t beat the price!!!!</li>
    <li> I actually didn&#x27;t think this flat iron would work so well but I was wrong, it works better then expected. Also as soon as I flat iron a piece of my hair, and I touch it, it feels cool to the touch, and not burning hot like you would think after flat ironing your hair. So glade I bought this A+</li>
    <li> I used it only once and then I didn&#x27;t even want to use it again, it took forever to heat up and trying to straighten my hair with it was unpleasant. The heat didn&#x27;t get high enough for me, and while my hair is decently long I&#x27;ve never had an issue with straightening it before.</li>
    <li> Nearly burnt my hair! Still, I love it though. Gets the job done and that&#x27;s why I bought it. It&#x27;s a little small though, so it takes me much lover to straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> When I would straighten my hair I could hear my hair snapping and it would take me more than 5 mins to straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> I must admit this flat iron works very well. It heats up pretty quickly. However you can&#x27;t adjust the temperature &amp; there&#x27;s no lock.</li>
    <li> does not straighten hair. I&#x27;ve tried it on many different types of hair and it doesn&#x27;t work. not sure if I can return it since I opened it which sucks</li>
    <li> wife is very happy with her straightener and so is my oldest daughter because she gets hers back now :)</li>
    <li> nicely built, works really well. i watched a few videos on youtube about hoe to proper;y use these and i gained enough confidence to try it on someone else first..lol.. i couldn&#x27;t believe how well it works at making hair dead straight unless you want to add a few curls, twists, or flips in yourself.</li>
    <li> As good as I hoped !!</li>
    <li> My wife previously own a Conair Mini Pro flat iron which she thought was a dream till it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;This recent purchase of the Revlon Mid Size Ceramic Straightener was a replacement for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fast&lt;br /&gt;Straightens hair in one stroke.&lt;br /&gt;It is very comfortable to hold while using&lt;br /&gt;Offers more protection from burns at corners and tip than the Conair Ceramic Pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
    <li> its great to use with hair spray it  keeps my hair in place, i love this,gave one as a gift</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my sister, and she adores it. It keeps her from using mine! It works pretty well, not as well as my $300 one, but for a 14 year old, it&#x27;s perfect. It does a great job, and it doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up, either.</li>
    <li> So far, working great, is light, heat fast, better than expected. And for that price, can&#x27;t beat it. I can bring it with me everywhere, because of its size and weight. Thumbs up to REVLON.</li>
    <li> There are some straighteners you buy because you want hair as smooth and flowing as a show horse&#x27;s mane, and then there are straighteners you buy because you&#x27;re at your local low quality megamart at 10 PM because your daughter decided she needed straight hair THAT INSTANT. This is that straightener. Purchased at Walmart for $10 for a girl who might or might not use it in the future, this straightener quickly became a cherished part of the morning ritual. Not because it bestows silky smooth hair straight out of a commercial, but because it is just poor quality enough that it will straighten bangs into perfectly sharp, punky spikes. That being said, it did die after a year and cause every plug it was tried on to fail, but I&#x27;ll be damned if it didn&#x27;t give it its all until then. I cannot in good faith recommend this straightener to anyone who actually wants a good product - hence the four stars - but if you are looking for something that will cost you almost nothing and provide an optimal messy bedhead look without product, then friend, pick up this piece of Revlon trash today.</li>
    <li> Good buy for the price, I really liked it. May even love it, if I take the time to use it more often.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife, and she is happy and said works pretty good.</li>
    <li> it burned my hair off. invest in a good one.</li>
    <li> I like the product, fast to heat. And nice product. Good in my thin hair and good for travel. Not too big.</li>
    <li> This is a very good flat iron. I only wish that it went up to 430 degrees. Otherwise great for the price.</li>
    <li> It does the job if you&#x27;re in a place with low humidity. But if you live somewhere where the humidity level is high, it doesn&#x27;t work as well. I feel like it could have a higher temperature setting.&lt;br /&gt;I do like its compact size and light weight.  Good for taking on travels.</li>
    <li> I had this for a long time, and after a billion times of me accidentally stepping on my trusty hair straightener, I finally broke it. This thing heats up pretty hot, and is durable (I stepped on it twice a week for the last like 3 months of its life with me). I had it for well over a year. sad I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> Simple, has held up well over the past year, does the job and great value.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this straightening iron. It has different settings and it also shipped quickly. The 1 inch is perfect size</li>
    <li> This is a big big help for such a low price! Heat is just right and doesnt make my hair smell funny. It doesnt make my hair dry. Straightening is faster since the metal pads heat in seconds, glides on hair perfectly. Good job revlon</li>
    <li> Works like it should. Nothing spectacular though. It doesn&#x27;t get super hot like some of the reviews have stated and it doesn&#x27;t glide through my hair as easily as my salon brand at home. But for an easy quick fix after a shower at the gym it works just fine. I do wish it would&#x27;ve come with a carrying case but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also to note: it is not a mini size. It is closer to a full size. But it is fairly light.</li>
    <li> Great iron. It heats up super fast. Just the right size. It works great. It&#x27;s easy to hold. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my thin hair, works great &amp; having a low heat setting is exactly what I needed. For the money, this was a great deal!</li>
    <li> For only 8 bucks it does a good job, only 5 stars because of the super low price. not the best, but the best for the money</li>
    <li> Works great - my only issue with it is that it&#x27;s supposed to turn off after an hour just in case you accidentally leave it on, and it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve come into my room four hours later and realized it&#x27;s still on. Fortunately it hasn&#x27;t burned my dorm down yet, but I&#x27;m a lot more cautious about turning it off now that I know that the safety turn off doesn&#x27;t kick in.</li>
    <li> Not the most high quality straightener, but for the price it gets the job done for my daughter.  She likes it very much.</li>
    <li> Really good little buy does the job really well.</li>
    <li> Thus straightener seems to be good and handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this hasn&#x27;t done the perfect job for my hair yet (thats maybe becoz I&#x27;ve got thick hair, its silky though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently using this with Garnier flat iron spray. Not sure why this doesn&#x27;t go so well with my hair :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But anyways, guess its a good one.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift so I am not sure how it works but have not heard anything bad about it</li>
    <li> it worked well on my niece&#x27;s hair what else is there to say except this is crazy nothing else .</li>
    <li> The flat iron is all that I needed , it is light and the heat is perfect for curl and straight  hair , I used the first time for my synthetic wig and it was very nice</li>
    <li> It straightens my hair so well!! And its great as a curler! :) I would definitely recommend this straightener to everyone!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly...glides through hair nicely without feeling like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;frying&amp;#34; your hair...</li>
    <li> Just the size I needed. Heats fast and straightens perfectly. I would recommend this product and its a great Gift for a loved one or friend to.</li>
    <li> It works, but I&#x27;ve bought other inexpensive under $15 irons at the store, and they seem better quality.  And I forgot to make sure it has auto- off, I thought all of them would have that in this era.&lt;br /&gt;It says lic by Revlon.</li>
