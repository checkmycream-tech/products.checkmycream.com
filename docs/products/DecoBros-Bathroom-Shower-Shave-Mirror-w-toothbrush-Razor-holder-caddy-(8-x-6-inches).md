      <li>Now I am enjoying the mirror for shaving in the shower.</li>
      <li>Otherwise quality seemed to be OK.</li>

      <li>The mechant read my review and sent me another mirror for free without me asking for it.</li>
      <li>Do NOT believe it will stay fog free.  </li>
      <li>Overall,  its a great mirror and it does what its supposed to.</li>
      <li>Not 100% fog free but close</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>Nice product, exactly what I was expecting, and shipping was quick.  </li>
      <li>Good product especially if you don&#x27;t want one with suction cups.</li>
      <li>, it was super clear and the toothbrush holder a really nice feature.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure about the adhesive installation, but is working fine, especially on a tiled shower.  </li>
      <li>The second mirror  stuck to the bathroom wall nicely.</li>
      <li>Nice mirror, but definitely not fog proof.  </li>
      <li>I have to continuously rinse it off or wipe it to make it of any use, but it does work better than my last &amp;#34;fog free mirror&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not expensive and that is well worth its value.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Got it fast, quality is what you&#x27;d assume, not bad.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what we needed for shaving while in the shower!😀</li>
      <li>Fogs in the first 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>It works just as advertised, the suction cup has held up in the spot I installed it on the first day.</li>
      <li>Love this mirror, installed it a few weeks ago and is working exactly as described!  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t really know why they say it&#x27;s fog-free.</li>
      <li>Give it a 10-15 second shot of water with your shower head to equalize temperature and it stays virtually fog free.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really usable for me.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this mirror to anyone looking for a replacement or fist-timer!</li>
      <li>It stays pretty much fog-free and clear.</li>
      <li>It does still steam up, and it is impossible to keep warm water on it in my shower, but it rinses off nicely.  </li>
      <li>Love the 3-handle/holder it comes with and much bigger than I was expecting, which is a plus, without being too big.  </li>
      <li>It will fog up once the water is turned on, but no problem, just run a stream of water over it for a minute and its all clear and ready to go.</li>
      <li>Far better than the previous mirror that I had to put a touch of soap to keep it from fogging.</li>
      <li>It does fog occasionally but a quick rinse leaves it clear for use.</li>
      <li>(approx. 8&amp;#34; tall x 6&amp;#34; wide) provides a &#x27;full face&#x27; view for shaving.  </li>
      <li>my lede is complete again with shaving.</li>
      <li>The tape is strong and I am certain it will not slide down the wall like my previous suction cup mounted</li>
      <li>Received in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I would stick to something a little higher quality than this one.</li>

    <li> Finally, a mirror that was built to take it.  Mirror is encased in a white plastic shell and rigid enough to protect the mirror itself.  The 3M adhesive is up to the task and easy to install.  The caddy is quite adequate to hold one or more razors, toothbrush, etc.  Give it a 10-15 second shot of water with your shower head to equalize temperature and it stays virtually fog free.  Nice, large mirror (approx. 8&amp;#34; tall x 6&amp;#34; wide) provides a &#x27;full face&#x27; view for shaving.  For the $$$, a nice product!</li>
    <li> I think I was supposed to put this where the water would hit it more since it fogs up. It fogs up if it&#x27;s colder than the air around it so I don&#x27;t really know why they say it&#x27;s fog-free. Maybe because they don&#x27;t charge you for the fog?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I can shave in the shower now and it holds our razors up. For the price it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for about a month now and it does the job. I used the sticky pad that was included to mount the mirror onto the tile in my shower. So far, so good. It will fog up once the water is turned on, but no problem, just run a stream of water over it for a minute and its all clear and ready to go.</li>
    <li> Bad on me for not thinking of this - but the method to attach this product to the wall is a foam adhesive strip, not suction cups. Since this will be in the shower, I&#x27;m concerned that removing this product will have two issues - 1. the adhesive will end up being permanent; 2. the foam may develop mold behind the mirror and I will be unable to clean it. I&#x27;m not interested in either of these potential issues, so I will be returning the product and searching for a solution with suction cups instead.</li>
    <li> would not stick to tub. Is not fog-free. NOT GOOD QUALITY</li>
    <li> Nice product, exactly what I was expecting, and shipping was quick.  I would totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Received in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. The mirror still fogs up.</li>
    <li> I got this because I wanted to shave in the shower. It says fog-free but it only worked about 2 weeks. It would fog up. Then I would splash it with water and now it has calcium deposits on it. Between the fog and the calcium It&#x27;s impossible to use.</li>
    <li> Very cool for the price</li>
    <li> Concept I like. Mirrow fogs up almost instantly in the shower.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Easy to install.</li>
    <li> My husband is a happy shaver :-)</li>
    <li> Perfect! Does exactly what we needed for shaving while in the shower!😀</li>
    <li> Works great! Far better than the previous mirror that I had to put a touch of soap to keep it from fogging. The razor caddy is very handy!</li>
    <li> The mirror is great.  It works just as advertised, the suction cup has held up in the spot I installed it on the first day. The hooks are great for both my razors and toothbrush. While shaving in the shower, if I notice any fog I spray the mirror with the shower head and it goes back to perfect. Overall,  its a great mirror and it does what its supposed to. Cant beat the price neither. Definitely recommend it to anyone who shaves in the shower.</li>
    <li> Not 100% fog free but close</li>
    <li> it is not a fog-free. That&#x27;s misleading information</li>
    <li> It stays pretty much fog-free and clear. The only drawback is you can not adjust the angle of the mirror once mounted. It has just enough curve in the mirror to make moving it unnecessary. The mirror is secured by 3M tape. The tape is strong and I am certain it will not slide down the wall like my previous suction cup mounted mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, a am very happy with the mirror.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror, but definitely not fog proof.  Fogs in the first 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> I installed the mirror as instructed.  Took a shower immediately and it fogged up instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I wipe the mirror with my hand I can get about 20 seconds of fog-free.  Otherwise, completely useless.  I would stick to something a little higher quality than this one.</li>
    <li> Very poorly put together. Was a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> It does continually fog up but it works a bit</li>
    <li> Pretty good product.  It does still steam up, and it is impossible to keep warm water on it in my shower, but it rinses off nicely.  I have to continuously rinse it off or wipe it to make it of any use, but it does work better than my last &amp;#34;fog free mirror&amp;#34;.  Don&#x27;t me mistaken!  This mirror takes constant maintenance.  Do NOT believe it will stay fog free.  It DOES NOT.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Hubby loves it. Stays up. Perfect</li>
    <li> Works well and has stayed attached to tile in shower. It does fog occasionally but a quick rinse leaves it clear for use.</li>
    <li> Neither fog resistant or nor durable. I had the mirror for no longer than a month before the plastic material used to coat the mirror-like paper began to crack rendering it useless.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a great shave and remembered when years ago I had a mirror in my home and that was possible.  I went to electric for convince but no luck, since I&#x27;ve acquired this mirror my lede is complete again with shaving.</li>
    <li> Regrettably the mirror has started to &amp;#34;bubble&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t know what else to call it. I loved it until this happened, it was super clear and the toothbrush holder a really nice feature.</li>
    <li> When I received the mirror and tried to install it but the two sided tape did not stick to my bathroom wall. I gave a two star review here. The mechant read my review and sent me another mirror for free without me asking for it. Kudos to their customer service! The second mirror  stuck to the bathroom wall nicely. Now I am enjoying the mirror for shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> Good product especially if you don&#x27;t want one with suction cups. If you&#x27;re concerned about the 3m tape being permanent, you could always replace it with command strips.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and does what it says.  Not much else to say</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worked great and doesn&#x27;t fog up all time.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad there is a place to hold my two razors.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really usable for me. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not expensive and that is well worth its value.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s never fog up and finally I can shave in the shower that is worked great for me unit now.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror, installed it a few weeks ago and is working exactly as described!  Wasn&#x27;t sure about the adhesive installation, but is working fine, especially on a tiled shower.  Love the 3-handle/holder it comes with and much bigger than I was expecting, which is a plus, without being too big.  Highly recommend this mirror to anyone looking for a replacement or fist-timer!</li>
    <li> We returned this mirror to Amazon due to the fact that it didn&#x27;t come with suction cups for attaching.  The only way to attach this to the shower is by permanent tape.  If it isn&#x27;t removable you can&#x27;t clean behind it.  Otherwise quality seemed to be OK.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, a real 5 star!</li>
    <li> Nothing about it is &#x27;fog-free&#x27;. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> Got it fast, quality is what you&#x27;d assume, not bad.</li>
    <li> It works great and was an easy install. Anti-fog only lasted about a week.  However I am sure there is something I am doing or not doing to keep the mirror from fogging.</li>
    <li> Didnt fog for 2 days after that it started fogging</li>
