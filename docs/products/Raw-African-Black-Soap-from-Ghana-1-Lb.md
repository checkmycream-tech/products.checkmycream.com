      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SOAP!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although there was not the amount of lather I am used to, the quality of the lathering is more important as my face was thoroughly cleansed, not stripped of oil and it felt wonderful!</li>
      <li>Great price and package got here very quickly.</li>
      <li>This soap is just amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest and will be 55 in 2 months</li>
      <li>I liked them both</li>
      <li>This soap is so cleansing I had to buy my own...</li>
      <li>This one is nice.</li>
      <li>The thing I liked most is that my irritated skin (acne) became reddened after I used it, as if the soap already knew where it was going.</li>
      <li>I love this soap been using it about three months now..</li>
      <li>Purchasing this soap was an experiment to see which one I like the most.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I love love love</li>
      <li>My kids love to use it also and it helps with their acne.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look or feel anything like the commercial soaps, but this is one of the best soaps I&#x27;ve used in...</li>
      <li>so others who are only ordering the ABS will know how wonderful</li>
      <li>but thats pretty good for just a soap.</li>
      <li>Face looks smooth and healthy.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it shipped quick and easy was fully packaged too.</li>
      <li>Works really great as a facial cleanser and body soap.</li>
      <li>It was so good that I let my 28 year old son try it</li>
      <li>3 pounds worth!  </li>

      <li>This product  helped me to feel clean.</li>
      <li>cleans it out thoroughly, makes it feel very light-weight and manageable, and leaves very clean, neutral</li>
      <li>it desolves quickly in standing water...</li>
      <li>I love using this soap it helps to keep my face clear and smooth.</li>
      <li>product comes in a (very lightweight) block, that is easy to break apart.</li>
      <li>Since it has tendency to absorb the moisture easily, I just keep the bulk of it in a Ziploc bag, and dissolve several pieces into a plastic bottle with a flip top and use it as a liquid soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is worth it to try it, for soft smooth blemish free skin.</li>
      <li>but the more I used it pimples started to fade, my pores began to shrink, and my face has a naturally cleansed look.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, to me it smells clean, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to wash out well on white wash clothes, but, my clothes show no effect from my using it</li>
      <li>I used part of this order to make the liquid black soap which i loved as well.</li>
      <li>Live it!!!</li>
      <li>This product came very fast and it was in the form of a block not pieces.</li>
      <li>Great lather, mild non-offensive scent, very cleansing, long lasting, and multipurpose.</li>
      <li>This review is from my first purchase of this soap that came in a combo order w/Shea butter.</li>
      <li>(i mostly use extra virgin coconut oil instead of lotion)</li>
      <li>At first it broke me out</li>
      <li>I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I used it on my face.</li>
      <li>My hands are soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Thanks ladies of Ghana!</li>
      <li>Have tried many different brands.  </li>
      <li>The soap is good for your body &amp; you get a lot for your buck,  but the use of it is quite messy.</li>
      <li>Just clean, soft skin, with fine lines disappearing, ( no I don&#x27;t have young skin</li>
      <li>It has a really \\&quot;natural\\&quot; smell that I wasn&#x27;t accustomed to at first, but it wasn&#x27;t putrid or anything like that.</li>
      <li>To be fair though I did rate this a 3 because I&#x27;m not sure yet of</li>
      <li>It is a little bit abrasive but worked nicely as an exfoliate soap.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean all day long.</li>
      <li>I really felt like I had a piece of history.</li>
      <li>I do have blemishes on my face and they didn&#x27;t seem to go away as fast as it did with my Neutrogena.</li>
      <li>I know it is very drying</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my face or  skin complexion.</li>
      <li>well my whole life.</li>
      <li>It is so gentle on your skin.</li>
      <li>It was very drying, and it stings.</li>
      <li>I ordered this soap and it came fast.</li>
      <li>I really feel cleaner than with other soaps, I love it.</li>
      <li>It removes dead skin, dirt and oils very easily.</li>
      <li>I like this product and will keep using it as long as it is available.</li>
      <li>I am an avid connoisseur of natural soap.</li>
      <li>I would love to use this soap but without the mess.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>but it has an high ph level</li>
      <li>I highly suggest u go to the dermatologist instead</li>
      <li>but it lasts a long time, gets your skin squeaky clean</li>
      <li>Not just a mental clean but a physical clean.</li>
      <li>I just ordered some more a few minutes ago...</li>
      <li>It left my skin feeling tight, smooth, and clean.</li>
      <li>I was just trying something new.</li>
      <li>It is very sensitive.</li>
      <li>It is not that attractive however, no matter what type of modern, sparkly dish you try to put it on in the bathtub, it will always be alarming to people who have never experienced this type of soap.</li>
      <li>This soap left large absess like bumps on my chin.</li>
      <li>I have been on a journey to change my life lately, trying to eat healthier(becoming a (vegetarian) as well as moving towards a more natural lifestyle.</li>
      <li>It took about 5 days to clear up her break outs</li>
      <li>Also leaves my skin soft.</li>
      <li>It was like the size of a brick with modest packaging.</li>
      <li>I prefer the one with shea butter(only because I have sensitive</li>
      <li>Might irritate sensitive skin, unless it is the type with lots of shea butter.  </li>
      <li>Trying whole body experience with this soap next.  </li>
      <li>I normally buy it locally from a lady who makes natural soaps</li>
      <li>I began breaking out large pimples, and I never developed acne the way I got it when I used this soap on my face.</li>
      <li>Helped reduce the hyperpigmentation caused by acne scars on my face and neck when no other at home products helped.</li>
      <li>when using the raw african black soap from Ghana, I have made two purchases of this product and I&#x27;m thrilled with how my skin is responding to using it.  </li>
      <li>They like it so much, it has become expected every year</li>
      <li>But overall I like this product as a natural soap.</li>
      <li>but I use aloe vera juice or citric acid to bring the ph level to 4-7 and it will not dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>this one - it does not dry out the hair, nor does it leave any sticky/greasy residue</li>

    <li> I use this on my body and its great. It removes dead skin, dirt and oils very easily. Also leaves my skin soft. When I tried it on my face I got a different effect. I began breaking out large pimples, and I never developed acne the way I got it when I used this soap on my face. It was very drying, and it stings. I think because the product has lime in thats why my face felt like it was burning when i used it. I will never use soap on my face agian, and will stick to cleansers.</li>
    <li> Purchasing this soap was an experiment to see which one I like the most.  I liked them both but  I prefer the one with shea butter(only because I have sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks For Everything&lt;br /&gt;:D</li>
    <li> I love using this soap it helps to keep my face clear and smooth. My kids love to use it also and it helps with their acne. but it has an high ph level but I use aloe vera juice or citric acid to bring the ph level to 4-7 and it will not dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> A lot of people are going to be turned off by this black soap. It doesn&#x27;t look or feel anything like the commercial soaps, but this is one of the best soaps I&#x27;ve used in...well my whole life. It has a really \\&quot;natural\\&quot; smell that I wasn&#x27;t accustomed to at first, but it wasn&#x27;t putrid or anything like that. The first time I used it, I used it on my face. It left my skin feeling tight, smooth, and clean. The thing I liked most is that my irritated skin (acne) became reddened after I used it, as if the soap already knew where it was going. I like this product and will keep using it as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> It is worth it to try it, for soft smooth blemish free skin. Works really great as a facial cleanser and body soap.</li>
    <li> I have been on a journey to change my life lately, trying to eat healthier(becoming a (vegetarian) as well as moving towards a more natural lifestyle. This product  helped me to feel clean. Not just a mental clean but a physical clean. Other soaps that I have used in the past haved left me feeling soapy, this product gives you a deep clean and natural feel and smell. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my face or  skin complexion. I always use the product for 30 days to see if there is a change. Only thing I did notice was that my skin was a little smoother but that&#x27;s it. I do have blemishes on my face and they didn&#x27;t seem to go away as fast as it did with my Neutrogena. I have come to the conclusion that I have acne prone skin and I need salicylic acid treatment. It is what it is...I have nothing against the soap it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I have oily to dry skin and i&#x27;m an African American female. I was just trying something new. You never know what works for you unless you try it. This just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> My skin has been clearing up since using this soap. It is very sensitive. All my acne has been minimizing. I&#x27;m happy with this soap.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SOAP!!! Great lather, mild non-offensive scent, very cleansing, long lasting, and multipurpose. Great buy, and i will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The soap is good for your body &amp; you get a lot for your buck,  but the use of it is quite messy. It stains your shower brown… you would need to wash your tub after every use. I would love to use this soap but without the mess.</li>
    <li> Helped reduce the hyperpigmentation caused by acne scars on my face and neck when no other at home products helped.</li>
    <li> My daughter received a piece from a coworker...she shared with me.  This soap is so cleansing I had to buy my own...3 pounds worth!  I&#x27;m cutting off chunks and sharing with friends. People are saying my skin looks younger &amp; they did not even know I was using Black African Soap!!!  Live it!!! Thanks ladies of Ghana!</li>
    <li> This product came very fast and it was in the form of a block not pieces. I love it and I will be ordering my shea butter from here also. I really felt like I had a piece of history.</li>
    <li> This soap left large absess like bumps on my chin. It was horrible and took me over a month to clear. I don&#x27;t recommend this product for someone with sensitive dry skin like myself.</li>
    <li> So I had received my black soap today and instead of it coming in a solid hardened block (which I would have preferred) it came in crumbling pieces. I didn&#x27;t like that!  To be fair though I did rate this a 3 because I&#x27;m not sure yet of well it works so I will be updating hopefully in the next 2weeks</li>
    <li> I love the smell, to me it smells clean, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to wash out well on white wash clothes, but, my clothes show no effect from my using it and I use non-white clothes when using the raw african black soap from Ghana, I have made two purchases of this product and I&#x27;m thrilled with how my skin is responding to using it.  I really feel cleaner than with other soaps, I love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for over a year almost two years. It is not a pretty soap. It looks like poop when floating in the tub...LOL. I use it to clean my body, and to wash my face twice a day. I use it to wash my hair about once a month as a deep cleanser. I have combination skin with only a pimple or two once a month. This soap has vertually eleminated the couple pimples each month. I do follow up with a glycolic acid creme moisterizer in the morning and Unrefined Shea Butter in the evening before bed...otherwise I think the soap would be to alkaline and drying alone. I purchase this and give it to family as a gift in the Christmas season. They like it so much, it has become expected every year and they look forward to it this year too. I keep it in a good draining soap dish...it desolves quickly in standing water... it will last a long time if you keep the bar dry when not using it.</li>
    <li> Question.. Why does the package say do not rub on face, not for facial use? Am I missing something? I read the reviews and everyone says great things about using on your face. Please let me know if I&#x27;m just completely missing something here. Thank you in advance for your time. No star as was necessary as I haven&#x27;t bought or used…. So I just gave a 5 star review after reading others comments. However would not let me ask a question without giving star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m here can I add this to a melt and pour soap base? Would like to make a gifts</li>
    <li> Great price and package got here very quickly. It was packed neatly and looked just like posted. Since I&#x27;ve used black soap b4 I know it is very drying so I always use moisturizer after.  At first it broke me out but this has happen b4 but the more I used it pimples started to fade, my pores began to shrink, and my face has a naturally cleansed look. This product is not for ppl with severe acne. I highly suggest u go to the dermatologist instead like I did and thn after acne clears up a little begin black soap regimen. For dark marks I can&#x27;t really tell. There&#x27;s slight fading and improvement but not right away and if u have sensitive skin use small amount because this soap does burn. But overall I like this product as a natural soap.</li>
    <li> I love this soap been using it about three months now..I&#x27;m hooked. It is so gentle on your skin. It clears any blemishes that you have. At the first try it was a little dry but with using it everyday you can&#x27;t even tell the dryness. I always moisturize my skin with an organic lotion so it stays having life in my skin. I will tell anybody to get this product. I love the way it shipped quick and easy was fully packaged too.</li>
    <li> I am an avid connoisseur of natural soap. I normally buy it locally from a lady who makes natural soaps but I could not get in touch with her and panicked. Of course, I came to Amazon to try and find something comparable. I ordered this soap and it came fast. It was like the size of a brick with modest packaging. Just how I like my soap to come packaged. I don&#x27;t have rave reviews about it (partial to my local lady) but it lasts a long time, gets your skin squeaky clean (i mostly use extra virgin coconut oil instead of lotion) and although I prefer my local lady&#x27;s soap, this was/is my backup soap. I like to keep it in the guest bathroom just to introduce people to the unconventional products. It is not that attractive however, no matter what type of modern, sparkly dish you try to put it on in the bathtub, it will always be alarming to people who have never experienced this type of soap. The benefits however, will always overshadow the off putting appearance.</li>
    <li> This soap is just amazing. It leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean all day long. It is a little bit abrasive but worked nicely as an exfoliate soap. I used part of this order to make the liquid black soap which i loved as well. If you have oily prone skin or acne this bar is a god send. My teen age daughter had some break outs on her forehead. Shes been using it for about 2 weeks now daily. Not one blemish left on her forehead at all. I will definitely be ordering more. It took about 5 days to clear up her break outs but thats pretty good for just a soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this product today and was absolutely impressed...the quantity and quality of this product was great...I just ordered some more a few minutes ago...I love love love this soap will never go back to store bought soap again</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for little over a year now, and so far it has worked like charm.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it both as a body soap AND a shampoo, which I would not think would normally be possible... from my experience, majority of soaps, even the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or organic ones are just a bit too harsh for the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Not this one - it does not dry out the hair, nor does it leave any sticky/greasy residue, that would make the hair look or feel limp.&lt;br /&gt;Just cleans it out thoroughly, makes it feel very light-weight and manageable, and leaves very clean, neutral scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same for the soap part: the presence of shea butter helps to prevent potential drying out of the skin, so it almost works as a moisturizer while it cleans thoroughly - once again, with no build up or soapy residue left on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a (very lightweight) block, that is easy to break apart. Since it has tendency to absorb the moisture easily, I just keep the bulk of it in a Ziploc bag, and dissolve several pieces into a plastic bottle with a flip top and use it as a liquid soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for its versatility and effectiveness!!</li>
    <li> The moment I opened the package, within hours mold began to formulate on the soap. What a waste of money. :-(</li>
    <li> This soap is the best.  I cannot get enough of it.&lt;br /&gt;It works beautifully on my skin.  Great for oily skin.  Might irritate sensitive skin, unless it is the type with lots of shea butter.  This is one, I believe did contain some shea.  Have tried many different brands.  This one is nice.</li>
    <li> This review is from my first purchase of this soap that came in a combo order w/Shea butter. I wanted to do this so others who are only ordering the ABS will know how wonderful this product is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard about the ABS on You Tube and needed to try it, as I have psoriasis. Even though the package came 1 day late, big deal, the product is what I am reviewing. I immediately washed my face and could not believe the deep cleansing job this little miracle soap did on this 54 year old face. I&#x27;ll be honest and will be 55 in 2 months but my face feels like a 30 year old!&lt;br /&gt;Although there was not the amount of lather I am used to, the quality of the lathering is more important as my face was thoroughly cleansed, not stripped of oil and it felt wonderful! It was so good that I let my 28 year old son try it and he now uses it daily.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a week and had no breakouts or any other problems.  Just clean, soft skin, with fine lines disappearing, ( no I don&#x27;t have young skin, I have retirement age skin), and deeper lines just almost invisible.  Face looks smooth and healthy.  My hands are soft and smooth.  No lotion seems to be needed now.  Soap has made my finger nails shiny and ridges are hardly noticeable.  Trying whole body experience with this soap next.  Takes a very small amount of soap to last a week.  Will continue to buy this product.</li>
