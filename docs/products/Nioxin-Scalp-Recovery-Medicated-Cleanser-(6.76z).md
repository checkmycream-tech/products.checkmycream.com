      <li>This product is advertised a sulfa free and it is NOT.  </li>

      <li>I bought this product for my husband who has tried just about everything under the sun for his extreme psoriasis that he has experienced for years.</li>
      <li>AND the 2% of the active ingredient is very effective for controlling dandruff.  </li>
      <li>His scalp has been a lot less flaky which is great.</li>
      <li>Shipment came in a few days which I was happy about.  </li>

      <li>My hair is dandruff free and I like the texture of my new hair.</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference after the first two washes.</li>
      <li>Most products only have 1%.  </li>
      <li>It helps my head from itching much more than anything I&#x27;ve gotten over the counter in the past.  :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad I only got the 6.76 oz.</li>
      <li>I have tried everything OTC and prescription, for over 30 years for my S.D., Nioxin is the first thing that really works!</li>
      <li>i have a really greasy scalp and dandruff, this works ok only.  </li>
      <li>I used to have certain periods where my head would start itching a lot at night.</li>
      <li>No, seriously, EVERYTHING!  </li>
      <li>The bottle says 100% flake free if used regularly, and that is no joke!  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone who experiences this condition!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it very since every couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>The red, raised splotches have become light and they are no longer raised.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery...</li>
      <li>I really like Nioxin Scalp Medicated Cleanser for my hair and scalp.  </li>
      <li>It really helped my itchy/dry scalp.</li>
      <li>I think this is the first thing I have ever left a full review on if that tells you anything</li>
      <li>The previous one I used (and loved, of course) was recently discontinued.  </li>
      <li>I tried shampooing more often, anc less often....</li>
      <li>I highly reccomend this product.</li>
      <li>Color safe, effective dandruff shampoo is nearly impossible to find.  </li>
      <li>they send it with the new packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The Lidex was only at best a temporary respite, as the lesions reappeared within a few days and was very hard on my skin.</li>
      <li>I am very allergic to sulfa and after 3 days of using this product I needed to go to the doctor for medical treatment.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is for people who have sensitive, itchy scalp</li>
      <li>I recently purchased both the shampoo and conditioner at a national chain beauty supply store, as I didn&#x27;t know I could buy it here, and the first time I tried it, I was totally amazed!!!  </li>
      <li>So far this is the only stuff that works.</li>
      <li>I had recently read about Nioxin Scalp Therapy and how much of a difference it has made in other people&#x27;s scalp and in some who have psoriasis, so I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
      <li>, I was very leary, but had little option left untried.  </li>

<li> I have been battling overly dry scalp for several months and nothing was working.</li>
<li> My big complaint is that even the Nioxin labeled for chemically treated hair will strip color from the hair.... and as much as salon color costs these days, that&#x27;s a deal breaker.  </li>
<li> The stylist used some sort of product that left my scalp dry and itchy, to the point it bled from my scratching.</li>
<li> i am diabetic and seem to have very dry scalp all of a sudden, like after i stopped using tanning booth, i had tanned for 10 yrs</li>
<li> So, if you are looking for a solution to your scalp drama, and have tried all the cheaper common options with no luck, I highly, highly recommend you try THIS product!</li>
<li> I do t know what it is about this shampoo that differs from the 20 other I tried, but it is literally THE only thing I have ever used that works!  </li>
<li> I have literally tried every store bought item for dry itchy scalp and this stuff cured me.</li>
<li> It goes away once I comb it out and blow dry my hair.</li>
<li> This is a must have if you have any oily, dry, and irritated scalp problems.</li>
<li> I hope they never stop making it, I may have to buy a few cases of the big bottles to last for decades if they do!  </li>
<li> No more scalp itching for my 93 year old mom</li>
<li> I have a very dry scalp, this shampoo alleviates a lot of the dryness (dandruff) but not all of it.</li>
<li> , wonder if the tanning was helping my scalp issures, now all i have is very dry itchy scalp</li>
<li> I had much dryness and little icky spots all over</li>
<li> Seller used minimal packaging (box and peanuts).</li>
<li> , I use it about every other day to shampoo</li>
<li> it seriously is the only thing I have tried that works.</li>
<li> Nothing worked, in fact some typical shampoos like Denorex and selsun blue made it much worse</li>
<li> Not sure why since this is used to treat my seborrheic dermatitis, not give me heavy dandruff (when I&#x27;ve never had it to begin with).</li>
<li> am not sure if the material is going to be the same.&lt;br /&gt;we</li>
<li> The shampoo arrived with no wrapping around it sealing it off and was apparently leaking and arrived to me dirty and dried up around the bottle.</li>
<li> I also deep-condition at least an hour, bi-monthly.</li>
<li> Purchased this product for my son who suffers from dry scalp.  </li>
<li> This shampoo got rid of my husband&#x27;s horrible dandruff that no other shampoo could touch, and it did it within a few washings.</li>
<li> , some dandruff shampoos can cause even worse dryness/itching.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This stuff is the only thing that worked to control the constant itching and flaking.  I think I&#x27;m allergic to something in most shampoos and conditioners, and this got it under control.  I continue to use this product about every third washing, along with the conditioner, to keep it in check.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband who has tried just about everything under the sun for his extreme psoriasis that he has experienced for years. He has been using it for approximately 5 days and can already see a difference. The red, raised splotches have become light and they are no longer raised. He also said that the irritation has also calmed. I highly recommend this product for anyone who experiences this condition!</li>
    <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis which is very mild. After shampooing, the itch went away but when I got out of the shower and started to comb my hair, there was a significant amount of skin flaking. Not sure why since this is used to treat my seborrheic dermatitis, not give me heavy dandruff (when I&#x27;ve never had it to begin with). It goes away once I comb it out and blow dry my hair. The dandruff will only occur when I use this shampoo........... I&#x27;ll be trying this shampoo out for bit longer. I&#x27;m just glad I only got the 6.76 oz.</li>
    <li> This is a reorder. I am a regular user.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE USED NIOXIN FOR YEARS AND I WOULDN&#x27;T CHANGE FOR ANYTHING ELASE.  I HAD NOT REALIZED THAT THEY MADE A MEDICATED CLEANSER.  IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING GREAT.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a year. I have ocasional dandruff, and since I do the keratine and color my hair, I couldn&#x27;t use the regular anti-dandruff shampoos. This one works perfectly and protects my hair.</li>
    <li> if you have dandruff this is the shampoo you need</li>
    <li> I mixed this with apple cider vinegar, tea tree/emu oil. What can I say, but ah! It really helped my itchy/dry scalp. Of course, you mix in your own ingredients with&lt;br /&gt;the shampoo, being AA, some dandruff shampoos can cause even worse dryness/itching. I also deep-condition at least an hour, bi-monthly.</li>
    <li> Discovered this in a panic years ago after having my hair straightened. The stylist used some sort of product that left my scalp dry and itchy, to the point it bled from my scratching. I use it once or twice a month as a \\&quot;clarifying\\&quot; wash and to keep the scalp healthy! I&#x27;d strongly recommend this for anyone with scalp irritation or dryness!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has worked great for me since I have began using it. It leaves my hair feeling clean and has cured my dandruff issue. I credit it also for reducing my hair loss as I rarely find hairs in shower since I have began to use Nioxin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a believer in this shampoo and I carry it with me when I travel as well.</li>
    <li> The shampoo arrived with no wrapping around it sealing it off and was apparently leaking and arrived to me dirty and dried up around the bottle. I am questioning if this product is legit?</li>
    <li> they send it with the new packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if the material is going to be the same.&lt;br /&gt;we will se it soon</li>
    <li> This product performs at a 5 star level.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to get rid of my dandruff and itchy scalp... So far this is the only stuff that works.</li>
    <li> I had recently read about Nioxin Scalp Therapy and how much of a difference it has made in other people&#x27;s scalp and in some who have psoriasis, so I thought I would give it a try.  My son and I have bad scalp psoriasis and have very bad flakes.  It makes wearing black very difficult!  I also have several inflamed spots around my ears and temples, as a result of this, and we have tried everything.  I recently purchased both the shampoo and conditioner at a national chain beauty supply store, as I didn&#x27;t know I could buy it here, and the first time I tried it, I was totally amazed!!!  The bottle says 100% flake free if used regularly, and that is no joke!  My scalp has never felt better!  I am using it twice a week, and I do let both the shampoo and conditioner set for about 4-5 minutes.  The conditioner is a must to use after you shampoo, as it has some ingredient in it that makes your scalp feel refreshed and clean! Everybody&#x27;s scalp is different, but I know this has been a turnaround for mine!</li>
    <li> The number of stars says it all...</li>
    <li> and it is cheaper too.  i have a really greasy scalp and dandruff, this works ok only.  my husband uses the nioxin for thinning hair and i find that controls dandruff much better.</li>
    <li> i am diabetic and seem to have very dry scalp all of a sudden, like after i stopped using tanning booth, i had tanned for 10 yrs and when i stopped with in a month i had scalp issues, wonder if the tanning was helping my scalp issures, now all i have is very dry itchy scalp</li>
    <li> Color safe, effective dandruff shampoo is nearly impossible to find.  The previous one I used (and loved, of course) was recently discontinued.  This product is sulfate free - my color has not faded at all.  AND the 2% of the active ingredient is very effective for controlling dandruff.  Most products only have 1%.  While it is pricier than drug store dandruff shampoo, it works so much better.  My scalp has never felt better.  And if you pay good money to color your hair, you don&#x27;t want to ruin it with detergent like shampoo!  I highly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> it seriously is the only thing I have tried that works. I have literally tried every store bought item for dry itchy scalp and this stuff cured me. except for when I stop using it. then it comes back.</li>
    <li> Smaller than i thought but works great. I have dermatitis in my scalp and this plus the Nixon medicated conditioner works great healing and medicating my scalp. This is a must have if you have any oily, dry, and irritated scalp problems.</li>
    <li> Works great! I have been battling overly dry scalp for several months and nothing was working. This has been great at clearing up my scalp. I noticed a difference after the first two washes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo/cleanser at the recommendation of a dermatologist to help control seborrhea on my scalp.  The fragrance is somewhat medicinal but not horrible.  My big complaint is that even the Nioxin labeled for chemically treated hair will strip color from the hair.... and as much as salon color costs these days, that&#x27;s a deal breaker.  I switched to Paul Mitchel Tea Tree Special Shampoo which helps control the seborrhea better and does not strip color.</li>
    <li> I have moderate to severe seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp, face and chest. I have tried everything OTC and prescription, for over 30 years for my S.D., Nioxin is the first thing that really works! It works on my face and chest as well. I have been using it for about two months now and I watched my scalp patches and skin lesions gradually heal and disappear without using Cortisone Gel (Lidex).  The Lidex was only at best a temporary respite, as the lesions reappeared within a few days and was very hard on my skin. Nioxin is a miracle!!</li>
    <li> Again I love this product, just can&#x27;t always afford it, then if you have to pay postage as well..... I don&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;Many Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Louise</li>
    <li> I luv this product! I have been using this for bout 3yr!!! It make ur hair grow!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It gives me body!!!! And not to much mostiser!!!!! But I luv this both shampoo and condition!!!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo got rid of my husband&#x27;s horrible dandruff that no other shampoo could touch, and it did it within a few washings. It has kept it gone for the last several years.</li>
    <li> No more scalp itching for my 93 year old mom and she has tried many products.</li>
    <li> My hair is dandruff free and I like the texture of my new hair. I will keep using it and I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Shipment came in a few days which I was happy about.  This shampoo is for people who have sensitive, itchy scalp and I love it.  I wanted to order the larger size bottle, but they were out.  This bottle size 6.8 oz.  They did a great job in packaging.</li>
    <li> This product is advertised a sulfa free and it is NOT.  I am very allergic to sulfa and after 3 days of using this product I needed to go to the doctor for medical treatment.  I am very disappointed in Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product if you have scalp issues that cause flaking.</li>
    <li> This product is the only one that has worked well for me. Dandruff has disappeared after 2-3 usages. I would strongly recommend to anyone having dandruff.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my bf. His scalp has been a lot less flaky which is great. Especially now that its winter. Im still hoping to find a sulfate free solution though... But a must try from anyone suffering from sebhor... Fast delivery...</li>
    <li> I used to have certain periods where my head would start itching a lot at night. There were red dots on my scalp. It would only last a couple of weeks once a year ( not every night) and then would disappear. It came and went. Years later a hairstylist recommended this. I also did go to a dermatologist and she could not help. This Nioxin medicating cleanser did the job. Once I noticed the itching would start, I&#x27;d shampoo my hair with this cleanser and it disappeared. I&#x27;ve been using it very since every couple of weeks. So not often at all. It has not reappeared since. My mom had a similar problem. Nothing helped, but this one did. No idea why, but that&#x27;s the reason why I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> good product. will recommend</li>
    <li> I have used the T-Gel shampoo for psoriasis before and it works but it stinks!!!  The Scalp Recovery shampoo works just as well and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  Yay!</li>
    <li> Zinc Pyrithiione is great for seborrheic dermatitis but for those experiencing hypersensitivity to sulfates, this shampoo has them. Light scent and not overpowering for anyone with allergies to scents. Great value and shipper was FAST! Package arrived 6 days ahead of schedule and the item was undamaged. Seller used minimal packaging (box and peanuts). Very impressive sale!</li>
    <li> I really like Nioxin Scalp Medicated Cleanser for my hair and scalp.  It helps my head from itching much more than anything I&#x27;ve gotten over the counter in the past.  :)</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for my son who suffers from dry scalp.  With the use of this product, his condition has vanished!!</li>
    <li> I have a very dry scalp, this shampoo alleviates a lot of the dryness (dandruff) but not all of it.</li>
    <li> Love the feel while washing my hair, and the feel of my hair afterwards.</li>
    <li> After I had my second child, my scalp went bananas!  All of the sudden it became itchy and seemingly inflamed at times.  I had much dryness and little icky spots all over that were very uncomfortable.  I tried EVERYTHING.  No, seriously, EVERYTHING!  Nothing worked, in fact some typical shampoos like Denorex and selsun blue made it much worse (more stingy).  I tried shampooing more often, anc less often.... no help.  But when a girl at walmart of all places recommended I try the nioxin they sold out of the salon, I was very leary, but had little option left untried.  When I saw their $22 price for the 6 oz bottle I about had a heart attack!  BUT, what do ya do!?  I tried it, I was amazed... I do t know what it is about this shampoo that differs from the 20 other I tried, but it is literally THE only thing I have ever used that works!  One use and I felt 100 times better, I use it about every other day to shampoo and I have zero itching, crusty spots, dandruff, flaking, burning or stingingl. It is like a flipping miracle.  I have not used the conditioner yet, I use whatever we have here.  I think this is the first thing I have ever left a full review on if that tells you anything..... I know wnat I went through before I found it and all the \\&quot;usuals\\&quot; (yes including neutrogena, organics, and burts bees) that did nothing for my issues or made them much worse.  I hope they never stop making it, I may have to buy a few cases of the big bottles to last for decades if they do!  So, if you are looking for a solution to your scalp drama, and have tried all the cheaper common options with no luck, I highly, highly recommend you try THIS product!</li>
    <li> Great products by this company</li>
