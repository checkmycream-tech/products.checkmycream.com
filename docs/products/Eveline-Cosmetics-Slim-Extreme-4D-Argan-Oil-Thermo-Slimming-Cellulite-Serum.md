      <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the purchase</li>
      <li>I have used quite a few Eveline products, this is by far one of the best.</li>

      <li>It smells wonderful, so I am disappointed.</li>
      <li>My skin isnt sensitive</li>
      <li>I really wanted this product to help reduce my cellulite, and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for 4 weeks now, but still no change.</li>
      <li>IT BURNS YOUR SKIN ALIVE, but i feel like its literally getting through the tissue and not to mention smells like heaven</li>
      <li>I would be careful with having it on your hands for too long because it does cause a burning sensation, but as long as you wash your hands after applying it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>Does absolutely nothing other than giving a mild warming feel for a few minutes.</li>
      <li>It sometimes gets a little too hot for me.</li>
      <li>really like that product and probably because I&#x27;ve been going back to gym and eating less craps, I have seen an improvement on my legs.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Feel it working. Great deal!!!</li>
    <li> I used this for a little than stopped. It does what it says! I didn&#x27;t see any results but that&#x27;s because I stop applying it to my skin. I just didn&#x27;t like the burning sensation it gives.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe the hype all it does is burn your skin has no effect on weight loss</li>
    <li> In week 3. Apply it twice a day. Rub in generosly until you feel the heat. Def see a difference</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. The warming effect last me for 35 min. Is still a good product. And arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> It don&#x27;t work I would not recommend this</li>
    <li> The burning sensation helps me sweat during workouts using it with my sweatband around my belly. However, I&#x27;ve been using this for over a week &amp; haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet. Will update if that changes.</li>
    <li> Really burns, not sure about this one</li>
    <li> Second time using it, it actually gives you the warm sensatio. I don&#x27;t know if it was because it was my second time using it but when I tried to use it while doing waist training I felt like my skin was getting burn but besides that is a god product, got here just in time</li>
    <li> It works with generous amount.. Will order more..</li>
    <li> This product contains both butyleneglycol and proplyenelglyol, dangerous chemicals.  Google them and see for yourself.  Would you put antifreeze on your skin?  Or chemicals that have caused kidney and liver disease! Not worth the money to send this back.  From now on, I will be sure to see a complete ingredient list before I order any personal-care products.  It smells wonderful, so I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> It smells awesome and the burn is not to intense! Noticed a difference within days! You only need a little bit so it should last for a while.</li>
    <li> i bought this to see if it worked on me...I wanted to loose some belly fat...this is works great I have lost inches on my waist... it&#x27;s has taken some good while because I only use it when I go to the gym this makes me sweat like crazy...I really recommend this it&#x27;s smells great and it helps</li>
    <li> Works great, no bad odor and it makes your skin shimmer and sweat at the same time</li>
    <li> It does what it says now I&#x27;m waiting to see results</li>
    <li> I really like this cream before my workouts. My skin isnt sensitive so it gives me nice warm sencetion and helps get rid of some extra water.</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time and it really burns, do not use it before bed time!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff the warming feeling is amazing</li>
    <li> Burning sensation, but see a little results but not the way I want because I don&#x27;t apply everyday.</li>
    <li> this works I did see a difference and no I haven&#x27;t worked out with the product but if I did I am sure it would work even better!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. It does get very warm on skin but does only last about thirty minutes.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to help reduce my cellulite, and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for 4 weeks now, but still no change. On the plus side, I really like the tingly sensation and the gold sparkle to the lotion. I would be careful with having it on your hands for too long because it does cause a burning sensation, but as long as you wash your hands after applying it&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;d buy it if you&#x27;re looking for some gold shimmer lotion, but not if you&#x27;re looking for a physical change in your skin.</li>
    <li> Results will vary from person to person and also time frame to time frame of same individual!! I give it a 2 thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> Makes me sweat works fast</li>
    <li> It sometimes gets a little too hot for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a few days so it&#x27;s too soon to see results but it definitely warms up a lot. I apply the cream every other day as opposed to twice a day but it smells really nice. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the purchase</li>
    <li> I actually bought that one during winter time, and the reason I started to use it every night is because it does warm up and made my body way warmer during the cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;I really like that product and probably because I&#x27;ve been going back to gym and eating less craps, I have seen an improvement on my legs.  Overall, I like the brand!</li>
    <li> Really helped the cellulite  on my thighs go away, only bad thing is if you stop using they&#x27;ll come back :/</li>
    <li> Good seller love the great cream</li>
    <li> Helps my legs smoothe out. I love the heat that cames with using it. I put it kn after showers and workouts.</li>
    <li> My favorite version of this brand.</li>
    <li> Does absolutely nothing other than giving a mild warming feel for a few minutes. If that&#x27;s all you want, by all means buy this but it&#x27;s an expensive skin &amp;#34;warmer&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great product when used with diet and exercise!</li>
    <li> I like the feel of the cream but don&#x27;t notice a difference in tightness of my skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried other&#x27;s some what of notice but with this one definitely see results in less than a wk who better to tell u ur body looks better than ur man i have ordered three more love it</li>
    <li> IT BURNS YOUR SKIN ALIVE, but i feel like its literally getting through the tissue and not to mention smells like heaven</li>
    <li> Great feel  it working</li>
    <li> This says you will &amp;#34;gently glitter with gold&amp;#34; but what actually happens is you sparkle like a damn diva . There&#x27;s so much glitter in this lotion and they say its 24k gold flakes but as I was once a pre teen girl I think I know what glitter looks like . Has a warming sensation and pleasant smell , I&#x27;ve just been avoiding it a bit because I don&#x27;t really want to be covered in glitter while I exercise .</li>
    <li> I have used quite a few Eveline products, this is by far one of the best. Adds a beautiful shimmer to your skin along with a warning tingle. Try it out daily for two weeks and you will be thrilled! Incorp. a good diet along with exercise.</li>
