<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like the relaxer. My hair feels great and the relaxer works fast. I must say that the shipping prices are RI-DIC-U-LOUS!!! though. be sure to get the conditioner when you get this kit... you put it in prior to using the neutralizing shampoo so it is a must have.</li>
    <li> This relaxer system is great! I just purchased the complete set. Not only does it completely relax the hair, there&#x27;s also a softness it provides. Just be sure to use gloves</li>
    <li> I love Affirm relaxer and will never again use another relaxer system. My hair is silky smooth, I need fewer touch-ups and it is so easy on the scalp!! LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. My beautician says she cant find it anywhere but thats fine because I order on amazon and bring my own. I also have tried the fiberguard but the results were not as good as the the moisture plus for dry and sensitive scalp.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product ! I use this product for over 15 years and I love it !&lt;br /&gt;My hair fells so smooth, shinny and health, like no other product can do it.</li>
    <li> I bought this relaxer system after months of research. I find that this relaxer does not have a harsh smell, does not burn or irritate my scalp, and left my hair feeling strong and thicker after all was said and done. I did buy the complete 5 Step process, because I feel the products support each other, but the relaxer alone made my hair feel stronger. This perm only takes 15 minutes to process and does not provide a &amp;#34;bone straight&amp;#34; look. If you&#x27;re familiar with tex-laxing, you know that leaving texture in your hair can actually help to achieve longer lengths. I definitely recommend this relaxer to someone who has been doing their own relaxers for a while and has the patience to nurture their hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering these types of products with Amazon again. I was lead to believe this was all one order. Instead I received 3 seperate e-mail confirmations and 3 times Shipping Cost. One shipping cost was higher than the product. I was sent a confirmatio that the orders would ship in 1-2 weeks. After I saw that there were 3 seperate order numbers and the outrageous shipping fees, I tried to cancel the same day and was told ALL 3 items had shipped. Two items were from the Same Seller and they sent them in two different boxes to charge two ridiculous shipping fees. They all could have fit in one box. Again, will not be using this service on Amazon again.</li>
    <li> This product did not irritate my scalp at all. Hair was left soft and straight. Recommend following up with one of the conditioners recommended to achieve this result.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 4 months and i&#x27;m satisfied, it keeps my hair smooth...i love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this perm for years. It helped repair my damaged hair after a bad haircut.  Its is safer and healthier than Boxed Over-the-Counter (otc) perms, but you have to know how to use it properly so don&#x27;t cause damage to hair or scalp.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this relaxer several times and I have fine course hair.  This relaxer is the best that I have ever brought from the store.  Also it is the exact relaxer that my hairdresser uses.  For best results use the Affirm Reconstructor right after you rinse out the relaxer.  Leave the Reconstructor in for 5 minutes, then shampoo with the Affirm Normalizing Shampoo.  The Reconstructor will strengthen your hair and you will only need to use it when your hair appears weak or limp at relaxer time.  I love this relaxer system.  Most store  brought relaxers leave your hair in bad condition and causes a calcium build up that dulls your hair.  I also recommend Kera Care Humecto creme conditioner.  Kera Care shampoos, conditioners, wrap set lotions and products work well with this relaxer system.  Affir.m&#x27;s relaxer system leaves your hair silky, shiny, healthy and bouncy!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend this product. My wife uses Affirm for 4 years, and she is happy with it. Every 6 months we purchase this product from Amazon.com, the price, the application of</li>
    <li> I have used over the counter kits and have never had the results that I got with Avlon Affirm Relaxer.  This is the best and it was simple to use.  You have to follow it up with Affirm shampoo, but I will never use any other product to relax my hair.</li>
    <li> I love a firm and all of its products</li>
    <li> i bought this product because i have used it before and i like it,i saw it on amazon ,the price was a bit high but i cant find it where i am now&lt;br /&gt;i purchase it and it never came</li>
    <li> Excellent delivery and good price</li>
    <li> I have always used affirm is the reason why I ordered and will order again in the future...received my item just as described and extremely quick..thanks</li>
    <li> I have normal hair and have always had a hard time growing it out. This perm is gentle and effective. My hair has grown at least 3 inches since using it.  Use a little less activator to minimize any scalp burn.</li>
    <li> All I had to buy was the shampoo ….Talk about a get deal. This saved me over a hundred dollars.</li>
    <li> I just used this relaxer for the first time two days ago and joy of joys, I did not get burned.  Additionally, my hair looks and feels shiny and beautiful.  This one&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> This product is very strong.  Not recommended for fine to medium hair types.  Also I&#x27;ve used relaxers from Walgreens that had better results than this.  Barely straightened my hair at all.</li>
    <li> because they live my hair so silk that I can advocate to others persons to  order it. thank you. I would like to order next week.</li>
    <li> This relaxer is by far the best that I have ever used at home.  My hair was extremely soft.  I have never had a relaxer applied and had these results..NO EVEN IN A SALON!!  I paired the relaxer with the 5 in 1 reconstructor and protecto.  All I can say is that I will never pay a hair salon to do my hair again when you can get this complete system and use it at home for a 4th of the price.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a number of years. So, it is a great product.  I received it right away.  It was a good deal purchasing it on line.  It is hard to find otherwise.</li>
    <li> I have been using Affirm relaxer products for the past three years.  I feel it&#x27;s gentler than other relaxers.&lt;br /&gt;I have and would recommend this product</li>
    <li> The product line of Affirm has always been a great relaxer system with conditioners added,so that women of color get great results w/o the worry about hair loss.  This was also a great bargain.  Thanks!!!</li>
