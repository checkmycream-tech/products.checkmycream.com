      <li>For me, though, I&#x27;m going to stick with my favorite.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s safe</li>
      <li>I prefer a better smelling product though</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s stronger than most scrubs, but I didn&#x27;t think this was a problem.&lt;br</li>

      <li>If you are more like me though - look in the Apricot Scrub instead.</li>
      <li>I love no perfume products; but would take perfume over something that smells like a kitchen cleaner.</li>
      <li>I love these products.</li>
      <li>I have rosacea so for me that means my skin is even more sensitive.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like (I can&#x27;t notice any obvious familiar smell), but I don&#x27;t find it to be very pleasant.</li>
      <li>Gentle, effective and I like the smell!</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no perfumes or dyes, but it does have it&#x27;s own mild soapy smell.</li>

      <li>I love washing my face, and I love that tingling, clean feel.  </li>
      <li>It did leave my skin feeling smooth, but most scrubs will.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I haven&#x27;t even noticed the smell, though it could just be because I wash the scrub right off.  </li>
      <li>I love how clean my face feels</li>
      <li>And rinsing is very quick and easy as you don&#x27;t have to rinse and rinse and rinse to get any soapy lather residue off your face.</li>
      <li>I do think this is good if you need a good exfoliating, cleaning, but be careful not to overdo it!</li>

      <li>Pretty good scrub, has a nice zing to it, but not my favorite scrub overall.</li>
      <li>There is also no fragrance which is a huge plus for me.</li>
      <li>I also reviewed this product for the Amazon Vine Program and discovered that it worked just as well as the exfoliating cleanser that came packaged with the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.  </li>

      <li>I also reviewed this product for the Amazon Vine Program and discovered that it worked just as well as the exfoliating cleanser that came packaged with the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.  </li>
      <li>This scrub goes well with the toner and light moisturizer.</li>
      <li>They mailed me the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System ([[ASIN:</li>
      <li>The Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System came with a cleansing brush that has a rotating head with bristles and a tube of exfoliating cleanser.  </li>
      <li>you have truly sensitive skin, this is may not be a good product for you.</li>
      <li>It has large rice granules that really scrub your face so that you get a very nice smooth face at the end.  </li>
      <li>There is nothing better than at the end of they day, makeup is removed, and face is clean, fresh, and tingly.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s best to apply it with the fingertips rather than a washcloth so as not to apply to much pressure or to scrub for too long.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try it because it is \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and \\&quot;unscented.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Now, whether this didn&#x27;t work for me because of the severity of my skin&#x27;s sensitivity or because there is something unique in terms of my body chemistry, cell turnover (or lack thereof),</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t get excited about it or rush out to purchase it.  </li>
      <li>My beard is clean of any debris and my face is clean.  </li>
      <li>They have to be gentle on my skin, but not so gentle that I don&#x27;t feel like my face has got a good scrubbing.</li>
      <li>I use the scrub and appreciate the clean feeling I get after using it.  </li>
      <li>The majority of those reviews ranged from positive to lukewarm, but it seemed like a scrub on which I could safely take a chance.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was using this as a daily cleanser, twice a day.  Definitely a bad idea.  My skin got red and irritated and started getting more oily than it normally is.  The directions say to use it a few times a week.  That might work out, but I&#x27;m too nervous to try with my sensitive skin.  I do think this is good if you need a good exfoliating, cleaning, but be careful not to overdo it!</li>
    <li> I love these products. I have just recently started using the scrub, toner and both night and day cream. My skin has never looked or felt better! And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this facial scrub.  It contains rice granules which is what scrubs your face but the granules are bigger than I expected, though I guess they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  What really surprised me about this product was the strong scent.  The scent is almost like a lemony cleanser - I&#x27;m not sure exactly how to describe it, but it is MUCH stronger than I expected for a product that claims to have no artificial perfumes.  The scrub does wash off nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a film or anything on your face, and afterwards your face does feel very smooth.  I didn&#x27;t experience any breakouts or anything when I switched which was a bonus.  Overall I like the product but if scented products bother you, this one will likely be too strong and I would suggest finding an alternative.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best exfoliant I&#x27;ve ever used.  I was skeptical at first due to the the thin solution and larger granules, but once i used it I fell in love with it. Some people may complain about the smell.  I checked online for a list of ingredients (which can be found here: [...]) and they do not add any perfume.  What a lot of people don&#x27;t understand is that a lot of times simply the ingredients themselves have smells.  We are too used to things with added perfumes we no longer realize that nature has smells.  What gets me is nice smelling shampoos and the like that say they contain tea tree oil, which is great for you but smells TERRIBLE.  I would recommend this to everyone, since exfolianting should be a regular part of our routine.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have bad acne and other acne medicines were not working for me.  So I thought, why do I keep purchasing products that are supposed to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; it? I liked the sound of this stuff because it didn&#x27;t have anything harmful in it.  I just want to say this product HAS NO SMELL.  I also didn&#x27;t get that \\&quot;burning\\&quot; sensation after using it.  After just 3 days of day and night washing, with the toner, my face is clearer.  I&#x27;m so grateful for these people.  They really are sensitive skin experts!</li>
    <li> Prior to using this product, I researched it extensively and read tons of reviews both here on Amazon and all over the Internet.  The majority of those reviews ranged from positive to lukewarm, but it seemed like a scrub on which I could safely take a chance.  That \\&quot;take a chance\\&quot; part is key because my skin is extremely fair and super-sensitive - sometimes it seems like if I even look too long at a new, different product, my face will break out.  Therefore, I am really wary when it comes to trying new skincare products, but my face got to a point where I was desperately in need of something that would exfoliate some dry, flaky patches and brighten up my skin tone a little bit.  So, I read the aforementioned reviews and picked up this scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment I popped the top, the smell made itself known.  The packaging may say that it&#x27;s fragrance-free, but  while that may pertain to the fact that they didn&#x27;t add perfume into the scrub, something in there gives it a very distinct, strong smell that is a cross between medicinal and industrial solvent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I noticed is something mentioned in pretty much every review of this product: the size of the granules.  Simply put, they&#x27;re quite large.  Now, I don&#x27;t create skincare products, but that seems kind of counter-intuitive to me, in that one would think that, the bigger the granules, the rougher they would likely be on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, I put a small amount in my hand and massaged it very, very gently on my face.  I followed that procedure every three or four days over the course of several weeks.  On the plus side, my face felt very smooth after each application. Well, I should say that the parts that didn&#x27;t break out in red bumps of varying sizes felt smooth.  I really liked that smoothness; in fact, my face hadn&#x27;t felt that soft in a long time, and that&#x27;s why I gave this two stars instead of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The breakouts, though, started off on the not-good level and all tooquickly reached terrible status.  Each time I&#x27;d break out, I&#x27;d wait until the bumps decreased somewhat in size and number and my face calmed down, and then I&#x27;d give the scrub another (exceedingly gentle) try, and meet with the smooth skin/breakout combo all over again.  To be honest, the fact that I continued with this experiment for as long as I did wasn&#x27;t the smartest move I&#x27;ve ever made, but I did so both because I tried telling myself that my skin just needed something of an adjustment period and because I so badly wanted to find a product that worked.  There came a point where I just had to admit defeat, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sincerely glad that this product works so well for so many people, because I know how difficult it can be to find effective products that don&#x27;t cause more problems for sensitive skin. I&#x27;m just a little sad that I couldn&#x27;t count myself among those who met with success when using this scrub.  Now, whether this didn&#x27;t work for me because of the severity of my skin&#x27;s sensitivity or because there is something unique in terms of my body chemistry, cell turnover (or lack thereof), etc., I don&#x27;t know.  All I can say is that I would caution anyone who has extremely problematic, sensitive skin to give this product a lot of serious thought before using it.</li>
    <li> Great product without a lot of junk in it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand all of the negative reviews about the fragrance!  The scrub smells very clean - it&#x27;s a natural smell from one of the ingredients I&#x27;m sure.  Definitely nothing to complain about!  I love the results from this scrub!  I have been a Clinique user for the last 10 years and wanted to try saving some $ by trying out this scrub.  I feel that it&#x27;s definitely comparable to Clinique.  Gentle, effective and I like the smell!</li>
    <li> The very first thing I noticed about this product when I popped off the lid was the smell.  It&#x27;s not a pleasant smell, but it&#x27;s not too horrible.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s &amp;#34;tolerable&amp;#34;.  Admittedly, I am very sensitive to smells, but seeing the other reviews, I&#x27;m not the only one to not like the smell of this product.  It does smell kind of industrial, like a household cleaner or something.  This product could definitely have benefitted from having some kind of pleasant fragrance added to it to hide this unpleasant smell.  The smell is not enough to deter me from using it, but I have to tolerate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather.  It&#x27;s advertised as a facial &amp;#34;Scrub&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s exactly what it does.  It has large rice granules that really scrub your face so that you get a very nice smooth face at the end.  It also removes make-up fairly well.  I have very oily skin and found that it did not remove all the oil from my face.  This is probably where the &amp;#34;gentleness&amp;#34; of the product comes in.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t strip all the oil from my face.  I find myself comparing this to the Apricot Scrub that I usually use.  Designed not as a cleanser, but as a exfoliator.  In this aspect, it really does it&#x27;s job well.  I prefer a better smelling product though and I&#x27;m not sure how gentle this scrub really is when it is such a powerful scrubber (big rice granules) and pretty harsh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product due to it&#x27;s smell and because I think the Apricot Scrub is a better product as a facial scrub.  I think the price is fair and it does do it&#x27;s job well though so I give it 3 stars.  It definitely can do it&#x27;s job as a facial scrub.  If you don&#x27;t mind the smell and your skin is not too oily, then you might give this product 4-5 stars.  If you are more like me though - look in the Apricot Scrub instead.</li>
    <li> I have random skin type such as oily,sensitive, combination, dry, and easy to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product once a month because if I use this once a week, my skin get dry and peels.&lt;br /&gt; Sometime I feel itchy. But it was for sensitive skin type so it was okay to use for me and also good price.</li>
    <li> I purchased the entire Simple line about a month ago when it was on sale at a drugstore. I have been unimpressed with the line, however this product is the stand out. If you want to scrub the heck out of your skin, this is the product to use. I use it several times a week with my clarasonic and it cleans my skin like no ones business. There is not a trace of makeup left after using this product. I would recommend this to anyone with oily and/or not sensitive skin. It will deep clean.</li>
    <li> Although it does say for sensitive skin, I would be hesitant to use a scrub with larger granules on sensitive skin areas such as under eyes and throat.  I do like that the product doesn&#x27;t have annoying floral scents and it is a product both my husband and I can use equally.  His skin is a bit more sensitive than mine so he has stuck with the Simple Facial Wash instead of this scrub.  I use the scrub and appreciate the clean feeling I get after using it.  As with the Facial Wash, it does take a bit to wash it thoroughly off of skin.  But in all, I like that I can use one product for both of us in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have to start my review by talking about the way this product smells.  While it doesn&#x27;t have added fragrance, it smells like... window cleaner?  That&#x27;s the closest thing I can think of to describe this weird scent.  It&#x27;s very off-putting and hard to get used to.  Even after being rinsed off, you can still smell it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrub itself is non-comedogenic, which is an absolute must for me.  However, the particles are very large and rough.  Why this is marketed to sensitive skin, I have no idea.  After using it, my skin felt someone dry. I ended up using it on my body instead of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that&#x27;s a lot of negatives, but overall I think it&#x27;s average.  I wouldn&#x27;t get excited about it or rush out to purchase it.  If you&#x27;re looking for a fantastic facial scrub, try [[ASIN:B0006VSVE0 Dr Brandt Microdermabrasion 1.7 Fl Oz]].  It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My go to facial cleanser of choice is a wash with an exfoliant in it. My color-stay foundation can be a bit stubborn to remove, so I usually need something with some texture in it to scrub the makeup off my skin and out of my pours. This Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub has a good amount of exfoliating particles in it, so it does a nice job of removing oils, old skin and makeup from my face. I don&#x27;t find the exfoliation of this scrub so dense that it makes my skin feel raw after using it. But for anyone not use to using exfoliants or with super sensitive skin, they may find the scrub makes their skin feel a little tender after using it. The scrub is not as dense as some brands, like the [[ASIN:B0000536Y7 St. Ives Apricot Scrub]], but does have just about the right amount of exfoliating particles for use with more sensitive skin types. There&#x27;s no perfumes or dyes, but it does have it&#x27;s own mild soapy smell. It&#x27;s a nice combination of face wash and scrub, that cleans skin will and leaves my face feeling refreshed, not dry. I like it.</li>
    <li> i have been using clean and clear morning burst for the longest and i wanted to try somethng new . i feel this scruber really leaves your face very clean eventhough it might feel a lil dry after wards but thats just me idk how others have felt , overalll i really liked it ive had acne for many years and i feel this scruber has made a change in my face.</li>
    <li> I live in southern Arizona and we are now in the dust-blowing season.  I have normal skin but I prefer using sensitive-formula products for my hygiene regimen.  This product is as mild as it is advertised to be, and yet does cleanse the pores of any deep grime with little fuss.  My face felt refreshed and yet clean after one scrub, and slightly moisturized as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does not contain annoying perfumes, which is also a plus, and doesn&#x27;t contain astringent which stings some skin types.  This is mild enough to be used several times again for a quick cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now tried several Simple products and have enjoyed all of them.  This scrub goes well with the toner and light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I tried this on a weekend because my skin is sensitive and I was concerned it might turn my skin red.  It didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s gentle, smells fine, easy to use and left my skin softer than I expected.  I used my usual Simple replenishing rich moisturizer after it.  Nice combination.  I&#x27;ll keep using this.</li>
    <li> I seem to have this problem with dry skin, but ever since I got this great Simple Smoothing Facial scrub, I&#x27;ve had no issues. This 2 pack allows me to keep my face clear of pore clogging materials and sluff off the old skin, it always feels smooth right after I use it.</li>
    <li> I break out into a rash at the slightest provocation. And some toiletries that don&#x27;t cause me to break out into a rash do cause me to sneeze until five minutes after i&#x27;m far far away from them. This product, however, causes neither rashes nor sneezing, for which i&#x27;m quite grateful. In addition, the exfoliating material is rice, which is biodegradable, instead of small bits of plastic common in other exfoliating cleansers which end up in the stomachs of wild animals, causing great harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans without over-drying, though i still use a moisturizer on my face after bathing, so don&#x27;t count on throwing yours away if you use one now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, at the risk of sounding a bit marketing-y, it actually is a little bit invigorating. I feel more awake after scrubbing my face with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is, unfortunately, a bit like lemon Pledge, but it doesn&#x27;t linger after the shower, so i don&#x27;t worry about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone who knows about such things once told me to never use a facial scrub every day, to alternate it with something else, so i use this on rotation with [[ASIN:B005TI7NQW Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel]].</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the product, as others have mentioned, however, I do have a problem with the smell. This Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub is something I may have bought even without having it offered to me via Vine, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy it (and if I had, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it again). Not that it&#x27;s bad or doesn&#x27;t work as advertised, but I don&#x27;t like the smell. I honestly don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like (I can&#x27;t notice any obvious familiar smell), but I don&#x27;t find it to be very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I have the most sensitive skin and breakout with EVERYTHING! I&#x27;ve tried every acne medication (prescription and over the counter) and this line is the best! my skin was so clear after a month of using their line! trust me you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> This facial scrub works well...it scrubs. My face did feel clean after I used it, mainly because this is probably the roughest scrub I have used. My skin can take it; however, despite my warnings, my daughter with the delicate porcelain skin used it for about 10 seconds and then washed it off. She&#x27;ll never use that again, it was too rough.&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint against it is the smell. I love no perfume products; but would take perfume over something that smells like a kitchen cleaner. I really like simple products (usually) and I&#x27;ll finish using this tube, but I&#x27;ll hold my breath.</li>
    <li> I gave up using exfoliating scrubs because my skin seems so much more sensitive as I age. Still, the dry winter air has done terrible things to my skin and it needed exfoliating. I decided to try the Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub because of the promise of non-irritating ingredients. Luckily, it worked exactly as described! I have used this scrub about 6 times in the last month and my skin feels smooth and it isn&#x27;t red or tender. The dry winter skin is gone. The scrub does a great job, but it&#x27;s still very gentle so it doesn&#x27;t overdo it. I&#x27;m glad I tried it and I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
    <li> 1. No too watery/too thick problem. Some scrubs or scrub/cleanser combo are too watery and don&#x27;t really scrub, or disappears after a few wipes. Some scrubs are so thick it&#x27;s like a paste and stuff fall off instead of stay on your face to be scrubbed. This is soapy scrub, but with the pad, you get long lasting scrubbing power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. No harsh scrubbing. It always feels ineffective and not penetrating enough if I gently scrub with my hand, so I usually put too much force and end up with a red/slightly hurting face. Well, the pad is the magic. Even when you don&#x27;t apply a lot of force, the rubber of the pad help adjust the force so the scrubbing feels gentle but firm. It doesn&#x27;t hurt but it feels penetrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the skin toner in the Simple line.</li>
    <li> I use this about once a week.  It gets rid of any flaky skin and leaves my face soft.  I have rosacea, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be okay on my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
    <li> I generally use facial scrub every night before bed. I find it easy to remove my makeup and as long as they are moisturizing they, along with my face lotion, keep my face spot-free without drying out my face and causing dry spots.  Simple&#x27;s Facial Scrub seemed like it worked well, but after using it for 3 days I immediately noticed I was starting to have mottled looking skin that was breaking out a little. NOT GOOD.  I found it dried out my skin too much as well. I do realize I have ultra-sensitive skin though; so it may work better for you, especially if you remove your makeup with some other form of cleaner first. For me and what I am looking for, it&#x27;s a definite no.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a regular exfoliater--my wife is the one with the medicine cabinet full of exotic facial products--but when my skin started to break out she recommended I try this \\&quot;Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub\\&quot; to give my face a good clean.  So I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice. It feels nice scrubbing in.  There are grainy bits in here that take the old skin off and leave your skin fresh and shiny. (If you believe the packaging, the grainy bits are made of rice!) I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, so I wasn&#x27;t bothered in any way, and I definitely felt cleaner after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging claims that this scrub is dye and perfume free, but there is a definite scent and it isn&#x27;t a nice one. I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews describe it as \\&quot;windex-like\\&quot; and that is about it.  It&#x27;s a strange, clinical smell.  Not something I would associate with natural ingredients. But again, if you look at the packaging, you see that this facial scrub is far from all-natural. Lots of chemical products in the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves this scrub and uses it every night before she goes to bed. I&#x27;m not that regimented, but it is nice to have to use every once in awhile when I need it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to admit right away that I&#x27;m pretty picky about my face scrubs. I have really sensitive skin, and I have to be careful what I put on my face, especially when it comes to scrubs. They have to be gentle on my skin, but not so gentle that I don&#x27;t feel like my face has got a good scrubbing. This Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub is kind of in between. It scrubs better than some I&#x27;ve used, but not as well as my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; face scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very simple, though, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, I&#x27;d definitely recommend giving this one a try. For me, though, I&#x27;m going to stick with my favorite.</li>
    <li> This Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub can be a little intense for those with sensitive skin, but used as directed it is a very effective product. After testing this out, my daughter was happy to use the rest of tube as part of her daily skin care regimen and it did make a positive difference in her complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> I often get dry skin on my face and wind up with those little specs of dead skin on my face and mainly in my beard, which is awful looking.  So a few years ago I started using a scrub every day in the shower.  This scrub does its job and gets rid of those dead skin fragments that occur on my face and get in my beard and keeps that area hydrated so they do not come back in between uses.  I use a tiny amount of the scrub (about the tip of my finger) and scrub it in the beard and it sort of lathers a little bit (with the water, but not much) and I scrub through my face and my beard.  I than wash it off and use a body scrubber, like a sponge thing.  I have been using this new facial scrub for a while and it works like any other scrub.  I have not had any irritation and it works nicely.  My beard is clean of any debris and my face is clean.  I am very happy with it and it works great!  Highly recommend for anyone who gets dry skin on their face and needs a way to scrub it off and keep the face/beard hydrated.</li>
    <li> It is very mild, and won&#x27;t make your skin feel tight or dry after using. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this cleanser if you do makeups. The cleaning power of this one is kinda weak to me.</li>
    <li> I am 44 and seem to have teenage skin... I started using Simple and I am finally getting clearer skin... I have had no allergic reaction at all, this is great for sensitive skin types!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I use it alot to get eye make off off when I am in the shower and am too lazy to use makeup remover prior to getting in. I use this for my eyes because it doesn&#x27;t bother them, and then other face wash for the rest of my face. Great product. Good price for a two pack. I recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is really not simple. It contains mineral oil and parabens, which have been shown to cause cancer. The texture is slightly gritty. It irritated my face. I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> Simple makes a nice facial scrub and it feels great on my skin.  I have sensitive skin, and it does not bother my skin.  There are a ton of micro beads in there that gives you a nice scrub.  Make sure you use moisturizer after washing your face to keep it nice and smooth.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been great on my skin. Even though it&#x27;s a scrub, it still doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dried out after use. I love it.</li>
    <li> I tried this because it is reasonably priced. I use other pricey items on my face, but still need to exfoliate.  This works really well.  Very fine, but noticeable scrub.</li>
    <li> I recently developed facial acne and have been trying a few different products to help manage it. I have used the Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub daily for two weeks. I was excited to try it because it is \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and \\&quot;unscented.\\&quot; Honestly, the only difference I have noticed in my skin is that it is a little drier. This product does not foam or lather well and it has an obtrusive aroma. I do not recommend it for combination oily skin or for people sensitive to strong aromas.</li>
    <li> This is the fifth Simple facial product I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to review.  I have sensitive skin.  With lots of skin products that I get to review I use once find them to be okay and then they end up on a back shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The line of Simple products have already replaced some of my usual facial products.  My face is very sensitive.  I have rosacea so for me that means my skin is even more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scrubs tend to really irritate my skin.  I had great results from [[ASIN:B005TI7LD2 Simple Exfoliating Wipes, 25 Count (Pack of 2)]].  This product like the wipes does a great job of exfoliating without overly irritating my skin.  After use my face is pretty red but not \\&quot;flaming irritated red\\&quot;.  within a half hour my face is back to it&#x27;s normal color and feels excellent.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because it claims that it is for sensitive skin. After using it for a week, my face has broken out. I noticed the change in my skin the second day I used the scrub, but I thought I would give my skin some time to adjust to the new product. My skin continued to break out and become more irritated, and today my face feels raw. It actually stung a little when I put facial moisturizer on (a product I have been using for some time and have never previously had a problem with).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be changing products immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have truly sensitive skin, this is may not be a good product for you.</li>
    <li> I tend not to enjoy intense facial scrubs so I was really interested in trying the simple smoothing facial scrub. The scrub is not very intense and it great to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face didn&#x27;t feel try at all after using it. I&#x27;ve using it with a fresh shaven face and with a lot scruff and I&#x27;ve found that there&#x27;s no difference. The scrub has a smell do it that&#x27;s stronger than most scrubs, but I didn&#x27;t think this was a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those people looking for a new facial scrub, I recommend this one. It works great and doesn&#x27;t cost too much. Whenever I use it in the shower, I feel extra clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got really oily skin and I have used St. Ives Apricot scrub for years.[[ASIN:B000UVY8IE St. Ives, Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, 6oz]]. It&#x27;s worked pretty well but I decided to try this Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub. I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this scrub has very small scrubbing particles. I could feel the difference the very first time. Compared to the the St. Ives scrub, it&#x27;s like comparing super-fine grit sand to coarse grit. I was surprised to read the ingredients and discover that the scrub is actually a type or rice. That&#x27;s pretty cool. In the case of St. Ives, the scrub is pulverized almond shells. Who thinks up this stuff?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, what I also like about this scrub is it is not soapy and has virtual no lather when you apply it to your face. And rinsing is very quick and easy as you don&#x27;t have to rinse and rinse and rinse to get any soapy lather residue off your face. So it&#x27;s faster and for me that&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to have good ingredients for the most part and I&#x27;d use this again. My skin is definitely smoother, less oily and feels better to me. There is also no fragrance which is a huge plus for me.</li>
    <li> I started using some other simple products, and really liked them. My Skin is on the sensitive side and I break out alot. I have always used the St. Ives scrubs, but lately felt like they were becoming a bit harsh either because my skin has changed, or their formula has. Either way, I thought I&#x27;d try this since I really liked the other products of theirs. The 1st time I used it, I really liked it! It has a really clean, non perfumey smell and didn&#x27;t seem to strip the natural oils from my skin like the St. Ives has been seeming to do. However, after waking up the next day, I had some large painful, under the skin pimples on my jawline. I don&#x27;t use a scrub everyday, maybe 2-3x a week. My skin started to clear up, then the next time I used this, BAM, same thing. That was when in struck me that it must be this causing the issue. I then thought, I wonder if there is oil in this (yeah, I know I should have checked before I bought, lol) Anyway, yup. MINERAL OIL, ew, is one of the main ingrdients. No thanks. It may not have many ingredients, but when the main one is mineral oil, in a facial cleanser, I&#x27;ll pass.</li>
    <li> Pretty good scrub, has a nice zing to it, but not my favorite scrub overall. Smell is chemically as expected but am used to citrusy/fruity ones that I prefer, I&#x27;m a bit spoiled. This does the job fine, just like my brand better.</li>
    <li> I have extremely picky skin.  The way I figure, my skin type could be classified as dry, acne-prone sensitive skin.  So a lot of products are way too harsh for my skin, even if they keep it from breaking/drying out.  When I saw the commercial for the Simple products, I was pretty excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product, the moisturized facial wash, the night cream, and the light moisture day cream.  I use the scrub and night cream at night (since the cream&#x27;s much heavier than what I would need during the day), and the moisture wash and cream during the day, and so far I&#x27;ve loved the results.  The products are nice and easy on my skin, the moisturizers work very well, and there&#x27;s no break-outs or rashes that I&#x27;ve been prone to in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s safe to say that I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen other reviews where they complain about the scent?  To be honest, I haven&#x27;t even noticed the smell, though it could just be because I wash the scrub right off.  So I don&#x27;t think you have to worry about being overwhelmed by a chemically scent, &#x27;cause I&#x27;m very picky about scents and I haven&#x27;t noticed anything about this stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this product recently to try out, since my usual facial scrub seems to be out of stock on a regular basis, and this seemed like a nice, safe choice. First, I do not like how the granules felt. They are larger, which doesn&#x27;t bother me so much, but the also felt rough. It did leave my skin feeling smooth, but most scrubs will. The deciding factor for me to never get this product again was the smell. I might be natural, but it smells AWFUL. I can&#x27;t even describe it, but it&#x27;s strong and chemically-smelling and down-right unpleasant. I picked up some of the Burt&#x27;s Bees citrus facial scrub on my next store trip, and LOVE it. Fantastic nutmeg smell, silky smooth feeling after use, and only $0.14 more.</li>
    <li> I generally enjoy Simply Natural products, and this facial scrub is no exception. However, there isn&#x27;t anything that sets this facial scrub apart. It certainly hasn&#x27;t caused any problems such as rash or other irritation, and the smell is pleasant enough. It is simply a very ordinary product. I was not upset, but I certainly wasn&#x27;t impressed. There are better products out there in the same price range. I would pass.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub, its very gentle yet one of the best exfoliators i&#x27;ve ever used.  Its creamy but not too thick like most gel exfoliators.  I love how clean my face feels when i&#x27;m done using it, it removes all the dead skin cells and leave my face glowing.  I&#x27;ve had problem skin for years and just recently decided to take a more natural approach to skin care and boy i&#x27;m glad I did. I use to use harsh topical ointments such as tretionin and salicylic acid and hated how dry and unpleasant my skin was.  Now I only use this, witch hazel and the Simple face moisturizer and I feel so much better, plus my skin has reacted in a GOOD way to not being treated so harshly.  I have read other reviews complaining about the scent but I&#x27;ve worked on a skin care product at my work and I know that that is what these ingredients smell like, if it smelled like anything else I would have second guessed the natural claims but it doesnt.  All I can say is if you want something that will be easy on your skin and still give you a good clean, this is the product for you. Love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have sensitive skin that is prone to breaking out. I should have read the reviews and ingredients before purchasing, so I take partial blame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is horrible. It smells like windex and is for anything but sensitive skin. It has mineral in it which clogs your poors and made me break out horribly. Im not sure how they can advertise a product as being &amp;#34;simple&amp;#34; when it has such harsh ingredients in it. I do not recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am a fifty-year-old male who never outgrew his oily, acne-prone complexion.  I can wash my forehead and an hour later it is shining like the full moon.  Fortunately, a few ago I learned about exfoliation through the Amazon Vine Program.  They mailed me the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System ([[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz]]).  Within two weeks, I noticed a remarkable difference in my complexion.  It felt cleaner and smoother, appeared less oily and more vibrant, and there were fewer blackheads and pimples.  The gentle sloughing of dead cells from my skin greatly improved my complexion by preventing the clogging of pores.  The Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System came with a cleansing brush that has a rotating head with bristles and a tube of exfoliating cleanser.  Any facial cleanser/wash is satisfactory provided that it exfoliates the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t have to be manufactured by Olay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub, 5 Ounce, is great for exfoliating my oily skin.  (Oily skin can be both a curse and a blessing; it is more acne prone but it is also less likely to suffer from premature wrinkling.  As I stated earlier, I&#x27;m a fifty-year-old male but people think I&#x27;m still in my mid to late thirties.)  The Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub has not dehydrated or damaged my skin in any manner.  I use a pearl-size drop of the white lotion twice a day--once in the morning before I shave and once in the evening before I go to bed.  It has a faint, nearly undetectable odor that does not annoy me like some lotions, creams or soaps.  Tiny scrubbing granules, mixed in with the lotion, enhance the exfoliation process.  (Those individuals with complexions that are already too dry will not want to use this product.)  Within only a week, I noticed that my complexion was smoother and less oily and it glowed with vitality; it was not red, scaly or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Those with dry complexions may want to consider using the Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash [[[ASIN:B005TI7LB4 Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash, 5 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]]. I also reviewed this product for the Amazon Vine Program and discovered that it worked just as well as the exfoliating cleanser that came packaged with the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.  It was also less expensive.  The Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash is gentler on one&#x27;s skin than the Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub; it didn&#x27;t have the large scrubbing granules that make one feels as though they are rubbing their face with sandpaper.  Carefully choose your facial wash like you choose your hair shampoo and conditioner.  I highly recommend the Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub for both men and women who have oily complexions like my own.  This economical exfoliate--a five ounce tube should last a few months--has a pleasant appearance and faint smell that won&#x27;t clash with colognes and perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B.

    <li> Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub has a gritty bits suspended in a milky gel base.  This has a bit more scent than the other Simple products but is still mild and pleasant, similar to lemongrass and soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a comparatively mild exfoliating scrub intended for the face but it&#x27;s best to apply it with the fingertips rather than a washcloth so as not to apply to much pressure or to scrub for too long. It will also remove dead skin cells from the feet, knees, and elbows.</li>
    <li> Usually, I use DHC products for my facial care routine, as they are usually great for sensitive skin. I have found that these Simple facial products seem to be a great inexpensive alternative to my DHC. This scrub has lots of exfoliating grains and it really seemed to work well in getting rid of dirt and exfoliating skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for with this product is the scent. It was just a bit of an odd mineral type of scent, probably due to the exfoliating grains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would repurchase this. Though, if you have sensitive skin I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this for everyday since the exfoliating grains in this might irritate your skin if used too often.</li>
    <li> Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub.  This is an awesome product.  It is good for scrubbing the face.  I love washing my face, and I love that tingling, clean feel.  There is nothing better than at the end of they day, makeup is removed, and face is clean, fresh, and tingly.  Sounds cozy to me!  Awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  Especially if you like to pamper yourself!</li>
