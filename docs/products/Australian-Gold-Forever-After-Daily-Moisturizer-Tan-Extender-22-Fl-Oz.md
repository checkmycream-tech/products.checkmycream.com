      <li>The feel of it is nice and it is a very good moisturizer but as far as the smell, I prefer Australian Gold Body Kisses instead</li>

      <li>Absorbed quickly and left my skin with a nice glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would repurchase!</li>
      <li>: my package came quickly and was undamaged.</li>
      <li>Its funny to see the expression on their faces when ya tell them its an after tanning lotion!</li>
      <li>It also game with a free travel size which is always a nice perk!!</li>
      <li>Smells like a freshly baked cake.</li>
      <li>but well worth it...</li>
      <li>I think the reviewer who described this as strong in favor of kisses has it completely backwards.    </li>
      <li>It makes my skin soft, lightly scented with --</li>
      <li>Oh and it makes my spray tans last much longer and helps them fade evenly! :)</li>
      <li>It makes your skin fell soft and smooth with a minimum of product application.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is &#x27;okay&#x27; though kinda hard to rub in and really white until you GET it all the way rubbed in... Smells amazing!</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin super soft and the smell is nothing short of fantastic!</li>
      <li>Love it all year long.  </li>
      <li>Smells good, lasts long, came double shrink-wrapped, and is very luxurious considering it is very affordable.</li>
      <li>this lotion is the only lotion i use now, i love the smell and my skin feel so soft!</li>

      <li>might go for something a little more moisturizing next time that keeps my skin smooth ALL day.</li>
      <li>I know a lot of other users liked the smell of this product, but I personally didn&#x27;t really care for the scent</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It is a little more money than some of the products over the counter</li>
      <li>It has a clean faint cotton candy smell.&lt;br /&gt;Makes your skin feel amazing.</li>
      <li>Shipped really fast and packaged 100% professionally</li>
      <li>It takes a while to rub in but is worth the extra effort.</li>
      <li>I live on an island so</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, but you&#x27;ll want to use it constantly because it just makes you feel so good inside and out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s priced so low on here and really does make my skin very soft.</li>
      <li>Even after showering the following morning I could still feel the lotion on my body so it really does moisturize for 24 hours.</li>
      <li>and being the frequent tanner that i am, i need all the moisture i can get</li>
      <li>much so that was my only drawback.</li>
      <li>much thicker so goes further....</li>
      <li>, so I can&#x27;t speak to the after tan benefits it provides except to say that my skin stays soft whether I tan or not.</li>
      <li>Keeps your skin so soft.  </li>
      <li>When I ran out I purchased kisses just to try something different and WOW while it does make your skin just as soft</li>
      <li>It makes my skin softer than any other product and I have noticed a big improvement in the evenness and firmness of my skin tone while using it consistently.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times.  It leaves your skin smooth, and also extends your tan.  The smell isn&#x27;t the best, but then again, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> l use this cream every day... Love the smell of it too. what a awesome price ty. Keep up the great prices and l will keep shoppin here at amazon tyvm. Australian gold moisturizer forever after.</li>
    <li> Two things get 5 stars here: the service and the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service: my package came quickly and was undamaged. The product also was unopened and undamaged. Shipped quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product: Fantastic! Smells like a freshly baked cake. Moisturized my skin so well I didn&#x27;t need to reapply. Absorbed quickly and left my skin with a nice glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would repurchase!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t remember if it was this lotion or the KISSES that I like. It has been a couple years since using an tan extender moisturizer, but I can tell you it wasn&#x27;t this. The vanilla musk smell is overpowering and lingers ALL day! Usually I cannot smell a moisturizer after a few hours of wear, but others I come into contact with will. This one I can smell all day long which I do not like! It is a fairly moisturizing lotion, but I cannot stand the smell. Note to self... buy the KISSES next time!</li>
    <li> Awesome!! HUGE bottle for a great price!! Shipped really fast and packaged 100% professionally and it smells delicious. I can&#x27;t wait to use this! I have heard great things about this product! :)</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin.  This moisturizer is fabulous!  I not only use it on my face, but my hands, arms and legs. I am so glad that I found this product.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This lotion does the trick. I was breaking out with eczema all over my arms and some spots on my legs and after using this lotion for about a week the eczema has all but disappeared. Even after showering the following morning I could still feel the lotion on my body so it really does moisturize for 24 hours. I know a lot of other users liked the smell of this product, but I personally didn&#x27;t really care for the scent much so that was my only drawback. I would still recommend this product to anyone who needs a great moisturizer because that&#x27;s what really counts and this product does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer.  It has the most wonderful scent and actually works as a moisturizer!  It goes on easily and leaves no greasy or oily residue.  It makes your skin fell soft and smooth with a minimum of product application.  I highly recommend this moisturizer.  Don&#x27;t be put off by the price as this bottle will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> The feel of it is nice and it is a very good moisturizer but as far as the smell, I prefer Australian Gold Body Kisses instead, it&#x27;s yummy!</li>
    <li> Huge bang for your buck here!  This will last me a long time and I plan to use this stuff every day.  No need to wear purfume anymore.  This smells fabulous.  A very rich vanilla smell but not a nausiating one.  People are always asking me what I&#x27;m wearing when I wear this.  It&#x27;s no joke that this lasts all day and makes your skin feel so soft and tight.  Highly recommend this!  I have already purchased this for several friends.</li>
    <li> this lotion is the only lotion i use now, i love the smell and my skin feel so soft! lasts all day..</li>
    <li> this lotion is great!!!&lt;br /&gt; not too heavy  and it smells like vanilla&lt;br /&gt;leaves my skin silky smooth&lt;br /&gt;I would definitly recommend this lotion for after tan care</li>
    <li> This lotion smells SO GOOD. It makes my skin soft, lightly scented with -- it think it smells like coconuts or vanilla mixed together -- it isn&#x27;t greasy! It&#x27;s great as a daily moisturizer and helps get the most out of your tans and tanning lotion when used just after tanning. It&#x27;s a lot of product at a great price! I have already recommended this to many people and will certainly be a repeat customer! It also game with a free travel size which is always a nice perk!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item before in a tanning salon and the smell was fantastic so when I purchased it on amazon I was thinking I was getting the same scent but it was different. I can&#x27;t say it is my favorite smell but it isn&#x27;t a bad smell. The lotion itself is amazing and I love it.</li>
    <li> I think the reviewer who described this as strong in favor of kisses has it completely backwards.    I used this for several months. It&#x27;s priced so low on here and really does make my skin very soft. The scent is light and sweet, and wears off quickly, which is nice because I don&#x27;t like to smell like tanning lotion products. When I ran out I purchased kisses just to try something different and WOW while it does make your skin just as soft it&#x27;s scent stays on you ALL DAY until you shower. I&#x27;m definately going back to this stuff because I don&#x27;t like smelling like a fruitcup all day. When it comes to subtle scents it&#x27;s just the way to go.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lotion. It leaves your skin super soft and the smell is nothing short of fantastic! A little goes a long way, but you&#x27;ll want to use it constantly because it just makes you feel so good inside and out.</li>
    <li> I switched from Australian Gold Body Kisses to this product because I wanted a change of smell. Body Kisses has a good, strawberry sort of smell to it. This one is more vanilla with a hint of perfume. It is very light, but has a fresh, clean smell to it. It makes my skin softer than any other product and I have noticed a big improvement in the evenness and firmness of my skin tone while using it consistently. It takes a while to rub in but is worth the extra effort. I only tan occassionally, so I can&#x27;t speak to the after tan benefits it provides except to say that my skin stays soft whether I tan or not.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about six years now and I never have any dry skin issues at all...I live on an island so am constantly in the sun and use it each day as soon as I come out of the shower....and I use it year round too....never get that winter dryness either....It is a little more money than some of the products over the counter but well worth it...much thicker so goes further....don&#x27;t think you will regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Works great for dry skin. I used it even.after i stopped tanning because i was addicted to how soft it made my skin. But it does forsure make your tan last longer</li>
    <li> Love it.....love it...love it...smells great, keeps skin soft not oily....love it love it ....it is a thicker lotion. Yet it a little goes a long way.....</li>
    <li> I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this lotion. Alot of after tanning lotions scents fade after they are appiled, NOT THIS ONE. I get alot of people who stop and ask what I&#x27;m wearing. Its funny to see the expression on their faces when ya tell them its an after tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> This lotion is &#x27;okay&#x27; though kinda hard to rub in and really white until you GET it all the way rubbed in... Smells amazing! but dried up to fast. might go for something a little more moisturizing next time that keeps my skin smooth ALL day. I put this lotion on and 20 mins later, feels like I&#x27;m not wearing any. and being the frequent tanner that i am, i need all the moisture i can get lol. Prolly wont buy this again :/</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase. It is quite a lot product for a good price and smell very good.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Smells good, lasts long, came double shrink-wrapped, and is very luxurious considering it is very affordable. Just ordered a 2nd bottle to have as back up. I am not going to run out of this stuff! Love it. Great company to order from as well. Their shipping and service is always fantastic. Will definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  Keeps your skin so soft.  Love it all year long.  Cold winters and warm summers.  It is not greasy and absorbs well.  Bonus it smells great.</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful! My boyfriend is very sensitive to products that have a strong smell, so this was a perfect purchase for me! It has a nice, clean smell that is not overpowering. It goes on easily and makes my skin feel wonderful. I honestly believe that it has helped extend the life of my tan.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I use it year round.  It has a clean faint cotton candy smell.&lt;br /&gt;Makes your skin feel amazing.</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome!!  It is super moisturizing on my skin and it smells great, like a nice warm vanilla!!!  I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this again...Oh and it makes my spray tans last much longer and helps them fade evenly! :)</li>
