      <li>My hair is in excellent condition pre and post perm.  </li>
      <li>Very happy with the end result.</li>
      <li>Iso is the best, I worried this was a knock off.  </li>

      <li>excellent product, I have been using it for 10 years.</li>

      <li>ISO 2 was a great option.</li>
      <li>Great perm without frizz.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair in great condition.  </li>
      <li>She was so happy with it, and I was happy that I&#x27;d been able to find a solution for her.  </li>
      <li>chose option 2, as my hair is bleached and brightly colored with semi-permanent dye (Punky/Special Effects).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this perm for many years - works best for my very fine color treated hair.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t very sure about how to tell whether the curl was &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; so</li>
      <li>Will order again for sure!</li>
      <li>I love the results of this perm for color treated hair!  </li>
      <li>This saved her using her own money and probably turned out a LOT better than whatever they would have done!  </li>
      <li>I really liked it.  </li>
      <li>I tried this perm, on my own, and WOW...magnificent.  </li>
      <li>I have been perming my own hair for decades.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own perms for twenty years, so I am not a novice, but there is NO sign of this having done a thing for my hair.</li>
      <li>decided to give it a go on my own about a month ago.  </li>
      <li>So, I used the perm solution as directed and it turned out so nice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d even used it to straighten a perm out of my own hair, and I&#x27;m not a stylist.  </li>
      <li>I was a bit apprehensive in using it because of that but decided to give it a try and liked the results.</li>
      <li>and I was very very pleased with the results and the better smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The best body wave I ever had including those done professionally.  </li>
      <li>This, by far, has been the BEST perm I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I have  been having my hair permed for 35 years and the ISO2 is by far the best perm.  </li>
      <li>Great product if you don&#x27;t want straight hair or want your hair to be over processed.  </li>
      <li>I love this perm.  </li>
      <li>Extremely satisfied with results</li>
      <li>Just love this perm.  </li>
      <li>I left it on 4 minutes and it was perfect - curly with no frizz.</li>
      <li>USED ONE AND WAS SATISFIED</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a better smelling perm.</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>It is better than a pricey salon.  </li>
      <li>This was mentioned as a good soft perm for tinted hair - very pleased with results - I would order again</li>
      <li>And another thing: it&#x27;s the first perm I&#x27;ve EVER used that did not wash out my bright colors and make them run.</li>
      <li>If you have fine hair and just want a body wave, or if you are wanting more curl...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Follow the directions carefully and the results will be excellent.  </li>
      <li>It gives my original waves and curls more definition.</li>
      <li>&quot; the instructions are inside the box and extremely easy to follow if you&#x27;ve given yourself a perm before.</li>
      <li>It was very gentle and gave a nice wave to my hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine, porous hair</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair</li>
      <li>Finally, a perm that doesn&#x27;t ruin my hair and looks great</li>
      <li>so having a perm is extremely important to me.</li>
      <li>Fantastic for my already dyed hair.</li>
      <li>It is a great perm for mixed girls.</li>
      <li>The texture feels very soft and curls are nice.</li>
      <li>ISO Perm is one of the most gentle perms that I have tried.</li>
      <li>Plus, my perm lasts for a full six months.</li>
      <li>I am overall very pleased.</li>
      <li>Not this time, I have lovely soft curls.  </li>
      <li>Worked great but was a year old perm, not a new one.</li>
      <li>I think alternating medium to large curling rods would be sufficient if your hair takes curl quickly.</li>
      <li>I had colored hair that was really mistreated and this perm solution worked nicely and did not further damage my hair.</li>
      <li>I have found my new home perm!!!</li>
      <li>I like this product very much.</li>
      <li>This perm gives professional results without the damage the in store products give...if you want less burned ends and healthier feeling hair it may not be as great as a salon perm but it is far superior to the box brands in the big chain stores.</li>
      <li>I used medium-large rollers for 18 minutes, and the curls came out fine, not tight or frizzy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d worked as a manager for a salon years ago, so I knew how successful that had been in the past.</li>
      <li>It is leaves my hair soft and light.</li>
      <li>so my hair looked funny.  </li>
      <li>The first one fell out after 4 months.</li>
      <li>The first time I used his it lasted about 10 weeks.  </li>
      <li>So, I just put it in, combed it straight, and it worked!</li>
      <li>I saw her this past weekend - gorgeous, shiny straight hair!  </li>
      <li>It has great natural looking curl without any frizziness, no smell and lasts at least 3 to 4 months.  </li>
      <li>It was extremely gentle on my hair but still curled it.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not much worse than before.</li>
      <li>It was supposed to cut smell of perm, but didn&#x27;t very well.  </li>
      <li>It is gentle, my hair does not fall out.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The green, pre-wrap lotion that you use to keep hair wet to roll instead of adding water did exactly what it said--kept the stuff smelling nice!</li>
      <li>I have fine and thin hair due to a brain surgery and Iso Perm works great on my hair because it has a &amp;#34;precondition&amp;#34; product in the box.</li>
      <li>I figured my hair would be highly damaged and fried -</li>
      <li>I have high lift colored hair.</li>
      <li>Fast ship and complete satisfaction.</li>
      <li>I will definitely use this perm again but will make sure it isn&#x27;t an old one next time.</li>
      <li>(No perm, just humidity and not taking enough time to blowdry extra smooth.)</li>
      <li>A perm mistake could have made it a fried mess, although many \\&quot;for colored hair\\&quot; perms barely make a wave.</li>
      <li>very mild for dry or fragile hair.</li>
      <li>I had this perm in my closet for nearly a year before I got up the nerve to use it.  </li>
      <li>I probably over developed the perm...</li>
      <li>No harsh smell because of the preperm product they provide.  </li>
      <li>While this is labelled \\&quot;professional use</li>
      <li>She was saving her money to have it professionally straightened at a salon.  </li>
      <li>Glad I bought two, thinking it might take it since my hair is thick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It did not damage my hair but the perm didn&#x27;t take very good. And the little that did take, didn&#x27;t last too long</li>
    <li> For wife, guess it&#x27;s alright</li>
    <li> I like this perm and the way it  lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t burn the hair.</li>
    <li> excellent product, I have been using it for 10 years.</li>
    <li> very mild for dry or fragile hair. I will never use another perm.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the end result. The instructions do not tell you an approximate wait time after apply the wave lotion. I kept mine in 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> I actually used this to straighten my hair.  I had gotten a perm a while back and it was growing out so my hair looked funny.  So, I just put it in, combed it straight, and it worked!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair in great condition.  However, it leaves a residual odor for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this perm for many years - works best for my very fine color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I have never used this brand before.  I really liked it.  It never felt dry on my hair as some others have.  If I had to say there was a downside, is that the prewind treatment was no good.  It was supposed to cut smell of perm, but didn&#x27;t very well.  I would recommend this product and will use again.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses these exclusively in her salon and recommends them to everyone, as Iso Perm has a different perm for each type of hair. Perms are very expensive in the salon but I can purchase these and pay only a small amount for her to give the perm. I have fine and thin hair due to a brain surgery and Iso Perm works great on my hair because it has a &amp;#34;precondition&amp;#34; product in the box. A perm will last me up to 5 months.</li>
    <li> Cannot tell I even had a perm. I&#x27;ve been doing my own perms for twenty years, so I am not a novice, but there is NO sign of this having done a thing for my hair. Sad.</li>
    <li> I love the results of this perm for color treated hair!  Finally, a perm that doesn&#x27;t ruin my hair and looks great</li>
    <li> Fantastic for my already dyed hair. My hair is hard to perm, being thin and dyed. The first one fell out after 4 months. I suppose that might be an average stretch for some. I am overall very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great perm without frizz.</li>
    <li> I have high lift colored hair. This is the only perm I can use and not damage the fragile hair. I only leave the solution on for 2 minutes and I get beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> The best body wave I ever had including those done professionally.  I would recommend got his product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions carefully and the results will be excellent.  Will order again for sure!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years... I would give it 10 stars!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.</li>
    <li> This was mentioned as a good soft perm for tinted hair - very pleased with results - I would order again</li>
    <li> I like this product very much. I have been using this product over four years.</li>
    <li> It was very gentle and gave a nice wave to my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product if you don&#x27;t want straight hair or want your hair to be over processed.  My hairdresser and I decided on curling rods that were too small (alternating small and medium).  I think alternating medium to large curling rods would be sufficient if your hair takes curl quickly. I will use this product again when needed.</li>
    <li> Best home perm kit.  It is better than a pricey salon.  Willl order again &amp; again.  Fast ship and complete satisfaction. A++++++.</li>
    <li> I wanted a perm that would not damage my hair since it had been recently permed &amp; did not curl correctly. ISO 2 was a great option. Glad I bought two, thinking it might take it since my hair is thick. However, one did the job! Now I have one when I need it again.</li>
    <li> I have been having trouble finding stores that carry perms anymore around here, so I delayed gratification and bought one on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose option 2, as my hair is bleached and brightly colored with semi-permanent dye (Punky/Special Effects). A perm mistake could have made it a fried mess, although many \\&quot;for colored hair\\&quot; perms barely make a wave. It was extremely gentle on my hair but still curled it. And another thing: it&#x27;s the first perm I&#x27;ve EVER used that did not wash out my bright colors and make them run. They still need a little freshening up, but the perm didn&#x27;t change them a single iota.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green, pre-wrap lotion that you use to keep hair wet to roll instead of adding water did exactly what it said--kept the stuff smelling nice! I&#x27;ve never had a better smelling perm. One perm ritual I won&#x27;t miss is counting the minutes until I can wash my hair to get rid of the awful smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; While this is labelled \\&quot;professional use only,\\&quot; the instructions are inside the box and extremely easy to follow if you&#x27;ve given yourself a perm before. The print on the instructions is TINY (in several languages) so get your magnifiers out! And of course, no wrapping pattern diagrams with the smiley woman cartoon like an over-the-counter perm, but who needs that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am never going to get another brand of perm if I can help it. This one was awesome!!</li>
    <li> This perm gives professional results without the damage the in store products give...if you want less burned ends and healthier feeling hair it may not be as great as a salon perm but it is far superior to the box brands in the big chain stores.</li>
    <li> ISO Perm is one of the most gentle perms that I have tried. It is gentle, my hair does not fall out. It is leaves my hair soft and light. It gives my original waves and curls more definition. It is a great perm for mixed girls.</li>
    <li> I had this perm in my closet for nearly a year before I got up the nerve to use it.  I had requested my stylist start using this solution on me and I was very very pleased with the results and the better smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it a go on my own about a month ago.  I am definitely a novice...I had never even wrapped my hair in curlers before!  I wasn&#x27;t very sure about how to tell whether the curl was &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; so I probably over developed the perm...but it still came out okay.  My hair needed trimmed afterwards but it ALWAYS does, even with pro perms.  Less with ISO than the other brands, which used to actually dissolve my ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be using ISO again.  I have fine, porous hair so I used Option 2.</li>
    <li> My niece was unhappy with a perm she&#x27;d gotten a couple of weeks before and wanted it straightened.  I ordered the Sebastian Iso 2 since she&#x27;d colored and permed in the past.  I saw her this past weekend - gorgeous, shiny straight hair!  She was so happy with it, and I was happy that I&#x27;d been able to find a solution for her.  I&#x27;d worked as a manager for a salon years ago, so I knew how successful that had been in the past. Sebastian ISO was the only type perm we used there, because it made your hair healthier than it was before. I&#x27;d even used it to straighten a perm out of my own hair, and I&#x27;m not a stylist.  She was saving her money to have it professionally straightened at a salon.  This saved her using her own money and probably turned out a LOT better than whatever they would have done!  I was about to order one just to make my hair look shinier and less frizzy, but I saw the ISO Maintamer, so I&#x27;m going to try that.  (No perm, just humidity and not taking enough time to blowdry extra smooth.)</li>
    <li> Just love this perm.  It has great natural looking curl without any frizziness, no smell and lasts at least 3 to 4 months.  Its a big improvement over perms that I have had in the past!</li>
    <li> USED ONE AND WAS SATISFIED</li>
    <li> No problem with order</li>
    <li> I have  been having my hair permed for 35 years and the ISO2 is by far the best perm.  It does not damage my hair like other perms can and it does the job. I have baby fine hair so having a perm is extremely important to me.</li>
    <li> You have no idea how grateful I am to have found this perm.  I usually end up with &amp;#34;brillo pad&amp;#34; scorched hair.  Not this time, I have lovely soft curls.  What a relief.  This is my perm from now on.</li>
    <li> I am a self-permer.  I have been perming my own hair for decades.  This, by far, has been the BEST perm I have ever used.  Of course, the hardest part is the roll up.  I try to enlist a friend, but there have been times I have to go it alone.  I tried this perm, on my own, and WOW...magnificent.  No harsh smell because of the preperm product they provide.  It is green, but washes out with the final rinse.  No frizz.  My hair is in excellent condition pre and post perm.  If you have fine hair and just want a body wave, or if you are wanting more curl...this is your perm.  I would recommend this perm to anybody that is tired of the frizzy dried perm, and tired of paying the outrageous price for salon perms.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.  I have found my new home perm!!!</li>
    <li> Worked great but was a year old perm, not a new one. I was a bit apprehensive in using it because of that but decided to give it a try and liked the results. I will definitely use this perm again but will make sure it isn&#x27;t an old one next time.</li>
    <li> I use this for my color treated hair and have never had breakage nor does my hair dry out.  Plus, my perm lasts for a full six months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling to find a  lasting perm that doesn&#x27;t leave a horrible odor in my hair, and creates soft, bouncy curls.  The first time I used his it lasted about 10 weeks.  I used medium-large rollers for 18 minutes, and the curls came out fine, not tight or frizzy. Also, it didn&#x27;t strip the color from my naturally grey hair.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it there was not much of an odor, but the second time, although I followed the same instructions, there was a heavy odor that woke me up at night. I rinsed for eight minutes in each application.&lt;br /&gt;Second time I used it the perm lasted about 9 weeks, but I spent a lot of the summer in a pool with chemicals, so that might have killed it.</li>
    <li> I tried this out and only permed the ends of my hair. I separated my hair into sections and put rubber bands on them about four to six inches up from the ends. Then, I put the curler rods in that bottom area below the rubber band. There is a name for this method - but I can&#x27;t recall what it is. So, I used the perm solution as directed and it turned out so nice. I figured my hair would be highly damaged and fried - but it&#x27;s not much worse than before. The texture feels very soft and curls are nice. I could have left it in longer!</li>
    <li> I love this perm.  Best one I have ever used.  No perm smell.  No frizz.  My hair is porous and color treated.  The directions say to check every 2 minutes.  I left it on 4 minutes and it was perfect - curly with no frizz.</li>
    <li> One of the best perms I ever gave to myself.  It was a little scary because the box says for professional use only, but other reviews said they used this perm at home.  Extremely satisfied with results AND it did not require papers or little sponges for each roller...just roll and apply.  That was great!!!  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Very expensive for this product, but since I only use Iso Perms, I paid.  I use to have a license to buy at the warehouse but did not renew it.  This is the first time I have ever got a bad perm, I may have processed too long.  Iso is the best, I worried this was a knock off.  I hate to give a bad review on something that could have been my fault, but have never had a failed perm with Iso.</li>
    <li> This is the best perming lotion. I had colored hair that was really mistreated and this perm solution worked nicely and did not further damage my hair.</li>
