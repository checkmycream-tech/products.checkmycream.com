      <li>Was hoping for the best..</li>
      <li>the best product that I ever bouht it</li>
      <li>this product is amazing!!!!</li>
      <li>My skin has continued to lighten gradually, and I am very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>extremely fresh !!!!!</li>
      <li>But when I applied in my skin the serum itself is very good.</li>
      <li>Very good I recommend it</li>
      <li>Im happy with it</li>
      <li>happy</li>
      <li>but I all the product is really great.</li>
      <li>Good thing is I haven&#x27;t use any deodorant</li>
      <li>It smells pleasant- nice and clean.</li>
      <li>I think this products is wonderful so far!</li>
      <li>The consistency was interesting.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months now, and I must say, I am fairly pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I might order another one if my skin is getting better.</li>
      <li>But it is working better than the stuff the dermatologist gave me.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t be more confident...</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed is how pleasant the smell is.</li>
      <li>it worked pretty good,</li>
      <li>KIND OF OILY BUT ABSORBS QUICKLY.  </li>
      <li>As for the lightening properties, which is the most important thing, I will have to update with results.</li>
      <li>Shipping time was very quick, maybe shipping an hour or two after purchasing.</li>
      <li>The delivery time was also very quick-</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see more of the amazing results I&#x27;ve already seen so far.</li>
      <li>I HAVE FAIRLY LIGHT SKIN, BUT WANTED TO LIGHTEN SOME AREAS....</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I started using this product in March and didn&#x27;t see full effect until August.</li>
      <li>I will say if you do plan on using this product make sure you have a really good moisturizer because it leaves you skin really tight after use...</li>
      <li>The consistency is somewhat oily, but it absorbs quickly and has not damaged any clothing.</li>
      <li>Also contrary to the online description, there IS added fragrance in this product, per the ingredients on the packaging, but the scent was light and fresh, so I wasn&#x27;t particularly bothered by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the product delivered right on the estimated date.</li>
      <li>I was excited at first because of all the positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and had issues all my life with underarms bruising/darkening easy from shaving or deodorants with aluminum.</li>
      <li>And for my purposes it was an excellent product although I will say two drawbacks they are firstly the smell, regardless of what other reviews may have stated this product does have a very distinctive smell, and secondly that it is rather strong and actually burned my skin the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>The bottle I received wasn&#x27;t quite as elegant as pictured, but the product is the same.</li>
      <li>I just used for the first time.</li>
      <li>I started noticing a difference in the first couple of days.</li>
      <li>Works really well..would recommend this to my clients!</li>
      <li>Good product gradually light your dark skin it takes time and you have to be constantly to achive your results ...</li>
      <li>I was concerned that it would be irritable as I&#x27;m using it in the most delicate regions, but I had no side effects, and two hours later it&#x27;s actually giving a pleasant cool sensation.</li>
      <li>I use it prior putting on deodorant to counter the effects of darkening and to my utter surprise, it seems to whiten it better!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really see any change.</li>
      <li>It is not irritating when applied and sensible to the skin.</li>
      <li>It is really nice and not strong at all.</li>
      <li>I had my reservations after it shipped, because while the description on Amazon specifies that the product is specially formulated for intimate areas (which is how I intended to use it), the actual packaging specifies &amp;#34;...knees, elbows and knuckles.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t give high reviews because I just started it</li>
      <li>I was curious if it is genuine product because the package seemed counterfeit.</li>
      <li>Im using it twice a day and in just a few days I started noticing the difference, the skin started to look lighter and more even.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After these inconsistencies, I actually got back online to check whether I had gotten the correct product, and the box/bottle looked identical, and the reviews had been good, so I decided to give it a try anyway.</li>
      <li>this is a really good product I use it in my daily face routine and it is slow lighting my darks spots on my face.</li>
      <li>Also I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I was just eager to share my experience so far because I have high hopes for this product.</li>
      <li>I would suggest avoiding use right after waxing/shaving, especially for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It is an incredible product, I recommended it me a friend I had a spot on the ugly armpit and use this product and remove it completely</li>
      <li>but so far I like it</li>
      <li>So, I say to the women of color, PLEASE do not waste your money.  </li>
      <li>and it also make my face really soft.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m not has</li>
      <li>I wasnt sure how much to apply, so I just put a thin layer everywhere.</li>
      <li>Slight smell but not doesn&#x27;t last long so it is ok to apply even going to work.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend to anybody that wants a lighter skin in specific areas.</li>
      <li>Well, it&#x27;s back to my natural color...</li>
      <li>, I use it to remove a stain on the face and disappeared in just one week of use, really works I recommend it widely.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The search continues.  I&#x27;ve used up an entire bottle hoping for at least a slight lightening of the skin.  But, no!  I&#x27;m sorry to report I saw no difference at all.  I was excited at first because of all the positive reviews.  Maybe, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m a woman of color and so this product is NOT for a woman of color.  I&#x27;m Latina, and so my skin is medium brown.  The darker areas of brown continue to stay brown even after using the entire bottle on the same area every day.  So, I say to the women of color, PLEASE do not waste your money.  However, if there is a woman of color who has tried a product that DOES work, please let us know.</li>
    <li> Was hoping for the best..</li>
    <li> Been using this for 10 days now, and am already seeing slight results. Been using it 2x a day as directed, plus exfoliating treated areas every day.</li>
    <li> Good product gradually light your dark skin it takes time and you have to be constantly to achive your results ... Im happy with it</li>
    <li> Purchased this and have used it for 3 weeks and have seen pretty dramatic results so for me the product is one that I would recommend. Being that I used it for &amp;#34;intimate lightning&amp;#34; but I am a 20 something caucasian male. And for my purposes it was an excellent product although I will say two drawbacks they are firstly the smell, regardless of what other reviews may have stated this product does have a very distinctive smell, and secondly that it is rather strong and actually burned my skin the first time I used it. Not for everyone but if you want dramatic results quickly I would suggest this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any change. I took pictures every week so I could notice a difference and nothing.</li>
    <li> it worked pretty good,</li>
    <li> I just used for the first time. The first thing I noticed is how pleasant the smell is. It is really nice and not strong at all. The consistency was interesting. It is not a lotion but a serum, and I would compare it to eye drops. Not too watery, but thinner than a gel. I wasnt sure how much to apply, so I just put a thin layer everywhere. I was concerned that it would be irritable as I&#x27;m using it in the most delicate regions, but I had no side effects, and two hours later it&#x27;s actually giving a pleasant cool sensation. As for the lightening properties, which is the most important thing, I will have to update with results. I was just eager to share my experience so far because I have high hopes for this product.</li>
    <li> The product did not lighten my skin at all. I tried the tummy tuck scar and the aerola scar did not lighten.Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I decided to use this for my nipples/areola area. While my pigmentation in this area is not DARK, but darker than they were prior to pregnancies and breast feeding, I wanted a little pick me up. Well, it&#x27;s back to my natural color...a peachy pinkish color...I started noticing a difference in the first couple of days. I stopped applying this a week ago, because I want to test if I need to use this indefinitely or if the transformation is permanent. Will update my feedback in another few weeks with the outcome of this test result.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t give high reviews because I just started it but so far I like it</li>
    <li> The delivery was on time. I was curious if it is genuine product because the package seemed counterfeit. But when I applied in my skin the serum itself is very good. It whiten my skin faster than I expected. It is not irritating when applied and sensible to the skin. Slight smell but not doesn&#x27;t last long so it is ok to apply even going to work. I might order another one if my skin is getting better. Let&#x27;s see</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and had issues all my life with underarms bruising/darkening easy from shaving or deodorants with aluminum. A couple of years ago I decided to get my underarms lasered so I don&#x27;t have to shave anymore, in hopes to lighten up my skin. I have tried many products and all have failed, some made my underarms darker. I read the reviews on this product and was a bit skeptical spending the money, thinking it will be another failed product. I bought it and gave it a shot anyway. I use it prior putting on deodorant to counter the effects of darkening and to my utter surprise, it seems to whiten it better! It does take a while to see the effects so be patient. I started using this product in March and didn&#x27;t see full effect until August.</li>
    <li> Been using for almost 2 weeks, haven&#x27;t seen not even a slight change :(</li>
    <li> Tried 3 times and I didn&#x27;t see any change at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months now, and I must say, I am fairly pleased with the results. I had my reservations after it shipped, because while the description on Amazon specifies that the product is specially formulated for intimate areas (which is how I intended to use it), the actual packaging specifies &amp;#34;...knees, elbows and knuckles.&amp;#34; Also contrary to the online description, there IS added fragrance in this product, per the ingredients on the packaging, but the scent was light and fresh, so I wasn&#x27;t particularly bothered by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After these inconsistencies, I actually got back online to check whether I had gotten the correct product, and the box/bottle looked identical, and the reviews had been good, so I decided to give it a try anyway. I began to see a difference in my skin color and smoothness after about 5 days&#x27; use, twice a day. I would suggest avoiding use right after waxing/shaving, especially for sensitive skin. After two weeks, I started decreasing my use to once per day, then every other day. My skin has continued to lighten gradually, and I am very happy with the results. The consistency is somewhat oily, but it absorbs quickly and has not damaged any clothing. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I used it as directed for 4 weeks and no change.</li>
    <li> It is an incredible product, I recommended it me a friend I had a spot on the ugly armpit and use this product and remove it completely, I use it to remove a stain on the face and disappeared in just one week of use, really works I recommend it widely.</li>
    <li> I HAVE FAIRLY LIGHT SKIN, BUT WANTED TO LIGHTEN SOME AREAS.... PRODUCT DID NOTHING FOR ME. I USED IT FOR OVER 6 WEEKS AND NO RESULTS. HAS NO SMELL... KIND OF OILY BUT ABSORBS QUICKLY.  REALLY DISAPPOINTED ESPECIALLY SINCE IT WAS A WE BIT EXPENSIVE FOR THE SIZE.</li>
    <li> this is a really good product I use it in my daily face routine and it is slow lighting my darks spots on my face. and it also make my face really soft. I will say if you do plan on using this product make sure you have a really good moisturizer because it leaves you skin really tight after use... but I all the product is really great.</li>
    <li> Works really well..would recommend this to my clients!</li>
    <li> Only works if you use it as prescribed, twice a day, every day. Sporadic usage will result in no results. Tingles a little on application, but nothing unpleasant. The bottle I received wasn&#x27;t quite as elegant as pictured, but the product is the same.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing!!!! I&#x27;ve tried a couple of brands and this one is the best of all . Im using it twice a day and in just a few days I started noticing the difference, the skin started to look lighter and more even. Also I have very sensitive skin and this has not cause me any problems at all. I would definitely recommend to anybody that wants a lighter skin in specific areas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for three days now, but the results are already beginning to show. I would say my skin is at least a couple shades lighter in the places I&#x27;ve used it! I&#x27;m following all of the instructions, using this product twice a day. I think this products is wonderful so far! It smells pleasant- nice and clean. It is of an oily consistency, but dries after it soaks into the skin. The delivery time was also very quick- the product delivered right on the estimated date. Shipping time was very quick, maybe shipping an hour or two after purchasing. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an at-home bleaching serum. I can&#x27;t wait to see more of the amazing results I&#x27;ve already seen so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now... Good thing is I haven&#x27;t use any deodorant and I can&#x27;t be more confident... On the other side, My underarms are still dark but I think they look just a tinny bit whiter but not much... I&#x27;m going to keep using it and find out it after a month something change. It smells is like man&#x27;s deodorant ....  So far I&#x27;m not has happy has I taught I was going to be after a week of use.</li>
    <li> Very good I recommend it</li>
    <li> extremely fresh !!!!! the best product that I ever bouht it</li>
    <li> So far so good. It has faded spots some but not completely. Also it can be a bit drying. But it is working better than the stuff the dermatologist gave me. And this was a third of the price.</li>
