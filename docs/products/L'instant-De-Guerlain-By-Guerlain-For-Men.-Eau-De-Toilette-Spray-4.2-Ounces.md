      <li>and i fell in love with the fragrance</li>
      <li>Glad I found out that Amazon is listing these from Guerlain.</li>

      <li>you will easily remember them.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
      <li>but I dont recommend using it in summer as its a strong one.</li>
      <li>It begins as a citric scent that&#x27;s not too strong.  </li>
      <li>, you get a wonderful full even spray with each pump even if you turn the bottle over, I used to wear Terre D&#x27;Hermes by Hermes, and for such a high end label their spray SUCKED!!!</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this out since I heard such great things about it</li>
      <li>Guerlain is the master of luxe and elegant fragrances of such depth and complexity that really makes them stand out as a top fragrance house of impeccable distinction.</li>

      <li>well this is worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>Seriously this cologne is some of the best out there and very distinct and very classy.  </li>
      <li>I am so happy I blind purchased this fragrance based on many positive reviews.</li>
      <li>Great and long lasting</li>
      <li>I love L&#x27;instant De Guerlain.  </li>
      <li>The first time i bought this EDT it was for about $109</li>
      <li>I bought this in the mall a few years ago and loved it.  </li>
      <li>Very long lasting, a great silage, an all around winner that drew praise from both women and men.</li>
      <li>Very nice cool/cold weather fragrance, not sure if I will wear it very often in the summer.</li>
      <li>But all the way through and what got the most comments from those who noticed is that scrumptious rich dark chocolate that never quite leaves.</li>
      <li>Blind bought this after reading so many good reviews on BN.  </li>
      <li>My mother liked!It is a good present to give as a birthday present.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Instant won&#x27;t set the world on fire, but it fits the bill if you&#x27;re looking for a very affordable, elegant scent.</li>
      <li>The dry down is incredible.</li>
      <li>It is never overpowering but still commanding and insinuates a certain confidence that is very Parisian.</li>
      <li>Very Lemony and spicy, very linked to memories.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky about the cologne my husband wears.  </li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>But it has really grown on me..</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to any man who wants to get noticed.</li>
      <li>I purchased this as a gift for a friend who is very discriminating and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
      <li>I love anything Guerlain and this scent does not let down.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I normally spend with amazon and have no issues with them.</li>
      <li>but i can live with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opens</li>
      <li>this one is not for you), personally i need to reapply after a couple of hours because i felt that doesn&#x27;t last on my skin, despite that, i searched and order here in amazon and surprisingly for half of the price(bid</li>
      <li>up citrusy and very classy.</li>
      <li>Think of a very classy man in a suit.</li>
      <li>Classy fragrance!</li>
      <li>Unique,Classy, mature scent which projects elegance..</li>
      <li>This cologne makes my husband the sexiest man alive.....</li>
      <li>It has a sophistication that isn&#x27;t common with many \\&quot;modern\\&quot; fragrances.  </li>
      <li>Sillage and longevity are decent considering the low price point.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s long lasting on my skin the shipping was FAST.</li>
      <li>Total quality and classy all the way.</li>
      <li>Not feminine at all as one might expect but so confidently masculine in the blending in of anise, cedar and Indian sandalwood that take over the bulk of the middle.</li>
      <li>Blind purchase and am really loving it.</li>
      <li>Different enough from the usual aquatics, but still light enough to wear in any situation.</li>
      <li>While L&#x27;Instant is more subtle than some of the house&#x27;s other fragrances, L&#x27;Instant has broad appeal.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I get alot of compliments on this scent.  I would recommend this to any man who wants to get noticed. You will be glad you bought it.</li>
    <li> If your looking for Colon to attrack girl or drive them crazy well this is worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;Just one spray and go to a party or school girl will turn their head I freaking love this colon best colon I&#x27;ve own.</li>
    <li> Well, I gave it a go.  Blind purchase based on reviews.  FAIL (for me).  Totally disappointed.  Came across as cheap and very, very strong in powder scent, which never came up in reviews.  Maybe it&#x27;s my nose, perhaps my body chemistry, but I do not like this, and cannot return it due to AMAZON policy.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a signature scent this could work for you. Different enough from the usual aquatics, but still light enough to wear in any situation. Total quality and classy all the way.</li>
    <li> Initially gave this a so so review cus it was different But it has really grown on me.. Unique,Classy, mature scent which projects elegance.. Got reallly nice compliments from the ladies at work</li>
    <li> Wonderful and elegant scent! Cannot recommend highly enough! Perfect for office and evening! You cannot go wrong with this fine cologne!</li>
    <li> Good fragrance that smells better with time.</li>
    <li> Blind purchase and am really loving it. Excellent.</li>
    <li> An absolutely beautiful fragrance from GUERLAIN. Very wearable and elegant. Can be worn with a suit or jeans and a tee. I have put off purchasing this fragrance for a long time because I simply can&#x27;t stand HABIT ROUGE, VETIVER and HERITAGE from Guerlain, which are so dated and smell awful on me. I am so happy I blind purchased this fragrance based on many positive reviews. Sublime. All the fragrance notes work together and don&#x27;t compete with one another. Will definately keep this in my rotation. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Instant by Guerlain is so incredibly wonderful. I was immediately enveloped in a vale of coco and jasmine on the opening notes. Not feminine at all as one might expect but so confidently masculine in the blending in of anise, cedar and Indian sandalwood that take over the bulk of the middle. It is never overpowering but still commanding and insinuates a certain confidence that is very Parisian. The dry down is incredible. Lapsang Tea and Hibiscus seed and musk it is almost oriental in feeling. But all the way through and what got the most comments from those who noticed is that scrumptious rich dark chocolate that never quite leaves. Very long lasting, a great silage, an all around winner that drew praise from both women and men. Guerlain is the master of luxe and elegant fragrances of such depth and complexity that really makes them stand out as a top fragrance house of impeccable distinction.</li>
    <li> It is nice perfume beautiful it is stay for long time .....</li>
    <li> Extremely pleased with this product.  I purchased it as a birthday gift for a friend.</li>
    <li> Been using this specific product for 10 years now, to me it&#x27;s amazing and I always get compliments of what brand I have on, it&#x27;s great for summer and winter and the best part is; the ladies love it ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about the cologne my husband wears.  A customer came into our business smelling so delicious that I had to ask him what he was wearing.  He told me he got the cologne in France.  Undaunted, I searched and voila!, Amazon had it.&lt;br /&gt;I never get tired of this fragrance.  Even my husband&#x27;s dirty clothes smell good.&lt;br /&gt;I told my husband to let me know if he gets close to running out so I can order more.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wonderful</li>
    <li> Very Lemony and spicy, very linked to memories. i mean when you use it in such a place and people. you will easily remember them.&lt;br /&gt;but i like Eau Extreme&lt;br /&gt;projection:8/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;longevity:8/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smell: 8/10</li>
    <li> This cologne makes my husband the sexiest man alive.....</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance!  It is exquisite.  It&#x27;s so good it&#x27;s hard to put into words.  It smells like a very sophisticated, classy fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells, to me of flowers and chocolate.  That&#x27;s the best I can describe it.  Classy fragrance!</li>
    <li> This fragrance has been one of my husband&#x27;s favorite fragrances since I&#x27;ve it for him first. So ever since we always order it. It&#x27;s great - strong, sexy and very attractive.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on YouTube fragrance reviews.  It smells sophisticated and is not overpowering.  It&#x27;s long lasting on my skin the shipping was FAST.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a masterpiece; should be the flagship fragrance of Guerlain.  To best explain this fragrance, it changes three times over the course of the day.  It begins as a citric scent that&#x27;s not too strong.  After an hour, expect a woodsy scent that is appealing.  By the third hour wearing this, anticipate an alluring, powdery vanilla that mesmerizes.  Expect to turn heads, and a 5-7 hour period of compliments and inquiries.  One of my favorite fragrances period.  Get this NOW!</li>
    <li> A great product came in a nice box and this is the second time to get this perfume and I really like it. It is kinda heavy smell but it really suites the cold weather and jackets but I dont recommend using it in summer as its a strong one. Over all I give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> I am a fanatic of Guerlain perfum.It is very smooth and grateful fot the noise.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for a friend who is very discriminating and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Great Price! Great scent!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this out since I heard such great things about it and if you, YouTube reviews for this eau de toilette, they are raving and ranting about it. So here is my experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;EVERYONE LOVES IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments by both men and women wondering what I&#x27;m wearing.&lt;br /&gt;BEST SRAY DISPERSION I HAVE YET TO EXPERIENCE&lt;br /&gt;this bottle sprays very nicely, you get a wonderful full even spray with each pump even if you turn the bottle over, I used to wear Terre D&#x27;Hermes by Hermes, and for such a high end label their spray SUCKED!!! I still have a little bit left of it because I can&#x27;t get the rest out unless I break open the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;LASTS ABOUT 15mins&lt;br /&gt;This scent has very weak staying power. I have to spray like 10 pumps if I want it to last 1hour or so. And I have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEADACHE&lt;br /&gt;personally, it gives me a headache. Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMMON TO OTHER MAINSTREAM SCENTS&lt;br /&gt;this stuff smells a lot like other scents out there in the market, everyone always tells me they have smelled what I am wearing somewhere else, which is disheartening since it&#x27;s sooo hard to find.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this fragrance and it was on time. I tried this out and the lasting power is crap, it literally lasted not even 15 minutes on my skin or clothes.I normally spend with amazon and have no issues with them.But I regret spending over 50 bucks on this &#x27;fragrance&amp;#34;, sO AMAZON if you&#x27;re reading this please make ammends with me and contact me with a replacement of another fragrance or a refund.Check my status, I spend with you guys ...Often!</li>
    <li> I love anything Guerlain and this scent does not let down.  I love that it does not stain clothing if you forget to spray before you put nice dressware on.</li>
    <li> Started of as a woody scent, and finish of as a really nice a sweet coco flavour. Will purchase again :)</li>
    <li> Blind bought this after reading so many good reviews on BN.  Initially I felt slightly disappointed with this cologne, it has a classic aura to it like a well made leather jacket.  By the third time I wore it, I LOVED it.  It has a sophistication that isn&#x27;t common with many \\&quot;modern\\&quot; fragrances.  You definately won&#x27;t mistake this for anything with \\&quot;Black\\&quot; or \\&quot;Sport\\&quot; in the name!  Very nice cool/cold weather fragrance, not sure if I will wear it very often in the summer.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne!  I bought this in the mall a few years ago and loved it.  My husband ran out of it and I looked for it everywhere.  No one had it anymore and I have no idea why.  Seriously this cologne is some of the best out there and very distinct and very classy.  If you like to be a man who wears something that no one has...I recommend this.  I always like when I can&#x27;t find something and I come to amazon and there it is for a better price!  Go amazon</li>
    <li> The first time i bought this EDT it was for about $109 and i fell in love with the fragrance, at the beginning is a strong smell, but after a while is soft but delicious it&#x27;s felt a little powdery ( if you don&#x27;t like powdery smells on your fragrances this one is not for you), personally i need to reapply after a couple of hours because i felt that doesn&#x27;t last on my skin, despite that, i searched and order here in amazon and surprisingly for half of the price(bid deal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a lot of complements when i wear it, definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great and long lasting</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves a good cologne this is the second time that he has purchased from this brand and I love it.</li>
    <li> Dries down to a musk-- i usually dont like musk but i can live with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opens up citrusy and very classy. Think of a very classy man in a suit. I wear this whenever i want to stand out.. whether at the office just a night out. Total compliment getter.Trust me. Only thing that compares with this for me is YSL La nuit de lhomme</li>
    <li> Love this scent! Perfect for client calls and late evening dinners. I always get compliments whenever I wear this.</li>
    <li> love this very masculine smell and stay longer on me</li>
    <li> My mother liked!It is a good present to give as a birthday present. I bet your beloved one is going to like it.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> I love L&#x27;instant De Guerlain.  It is just delicious! :-)</li>
    <li> Guerlain&#x27;s men&#x27;s offerings have stood the test of time. While L&#x27;Instant is more subtle than some of the house&#x27;s other fragrances, L&#x27;Instant has broad appeal. For the price, this is a good bet that is versatile enough for day and evening wear in all seasons. I don&#x27;t think people will necessarily remember you by this fragrance, but you will smell sophisticated and chic wearing it! Sillage and longevity are decent considering the low price point. L&#x27;Instant won&#x27;t set the world on fire, but it fits the bill if you&#x27;re looking for a very affordable, elegant scent.</li>
    <li> Original product, amazing scent, unbeatable price &amp; quick delivery! Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better deal!</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance.  Glad I found out that Amazon is listing these from Guerlain.</li>
