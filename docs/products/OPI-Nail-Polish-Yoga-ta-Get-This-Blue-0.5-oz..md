    <li> this color is so pretty</li>
    <li> Great color and a good thick polish</li>
    <li> Im loving this color. OPI is one of mt fav nail polishes. Very happy</li>
    <li> Love...Love...Love this color</li>
    <li> This polish is drop dead gorgeous.  It looks just like the picture.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this color!! It is such a beautiful&lt;br /&gt;vibrant blue!!</li>
    <li> Like OPI polish, liked the color, broke some nails, so haven&#x27;t used yet</li>
    <li> Beautiful color by itself, even more gorgeous with a matte to coat. This is a color that gets compliments</li>
    <li> Really love this color</li>
    <li> I love this polish! I have always loved OPI so the quality of this product was awesome as I expected and this color is gorgeous! It is a nice alternative to just plain black if you are looking for a dark color to jazz up an outfit.</li>
    <li> totaally loved this color!!</li>
    <li> What can I say? OPI is the best! This is a deep. dark rich-looking blue. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Excellent nail polish, love the color</li>
    <li> Yes it is dark,  but it looks really pretty when the lights hit it. Plus it cover really well with one or two coats.</li>
    <li> OPI has very pretty colors and they coats last a very long time.  I bought this color for my daughter, she absolute loves it!  She needed this to match a costume for the school talent show and it was perfect! She did alternating colors of blue and pink and it was adorable!</li>
    <li> An absolutely amazing color. Easily became my favorite blue.</li>
    <li> A little to much like Royal, and goes on thicker than I prefer, not as smoothly as other brands I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Given the price, I find that disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;Passing it on to an OPI fan</li>
    <li> Love OPI brand polish best. This color is deep and true, and it wears well with no chipping. It was well packaged for safe shipping and arrived sooner than promised. I would recommend this polish, this color, and this seller.</li>
    <li> Get it!!! Very pretty and looks brighter in the day light. I have base coat and two coats of the polish. Love how shiny it is.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty but takes a few coats to look good and stained my nails even with a base coat. It reminds me a lot of Essie&#x27;s Aruba Blue.</li>
    <li> on voge like the color</li>
    <li> I love this dark blue color. It is nice for a change from the dull pinks and reds. The color is very nice, love the sparkle. As always the OPI brand did not dissapoint. Goes on easy and looks great.</li>
    <li> Great products and received timely</li>
    <li> beautiful color. spreads eventually. nice thick brush. makes doing you nails fun not a chore. the deep blue really goes on nice, not too many coats. very pretty glad I purchased it. will do it again. I should have bought 3. I love the OPI brand.</li>
    <li> This is a happy color.  Not too dark.&lt;br /&gt;Opi has beautiful shades and this is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, don&#x27;t be blue...get blue and be happy.</li>
    <li> love the color and quality</li>
    <li> Had this color on mani- for many times, finally got one for myself. My friend said it is too dark on hands, maybe better on feet. I don&#x27;t know, but I love it~</li>
    <li> Love this color, true to the picture of it</li>
    <li> I love this dark blue color. It is nice for a change from the dull pinks and reds. The color is very nice, love the sparkle. As always the OPI brand did not disappoint. Goes on easy and looks great will buy again.</li>
    <li> OMG! Color is lovely! I don&#x27;t use it yet but I&#x27;m already excited and looking in using this at weekend.</li>
    <li> I heard so many rave reviews about OPI nail polish that I thought I would give this brand a try when I saw this color. The color is very close to what you see in the picture. I love how it shines. One or two coats is all you need to achieve the color. The only thing I would recommend is that you invest in some basecoat because it will discolor your nails. It would also be a good idea to buy a topcoat or a nail hardener because it will chip if you&#x27;re hard on your hands. That said, the application lasted about a week.</li>
    <li> loved the color, but it chips and wears quickly</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color but it chips off ridiculously fast. It didn&#x27;t even last 24 hours even with a topcoat I&#x27;m extremely disappointed, it looks so pretty on.</li>
    <li> I have never used blue polish before, but I wanted to try something new.  I figured why not try based on the good reviews.  The blue on this polish is lovely. A blue with a shiny tint.  It looks really nice, not too dark, not too blue.  I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the blue color and it looks great on.  It did chip faster than I would have liked but still good nail polish.</li>
    <li> if you are a fan of really dark blue nail polish than this is for you. The color is perfect. It matches the color in the picture very well. You gotta get this blue.</li>
    <li> My favorite color offered by OPI!!</li>
    <li> Brought for niece. She love the dark color.  I new generation with these colors.</li>
    <li> I have many Blue Polishes but this one is my favorite,the color is just like the picture with a shiny tint,i used a base coat first than used two coats of the polish along with a top coat and it has lasted a week .Has yet to chip and last long.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is perfect for any day. I love it</li>
    <li> I tell ya I wasnt always a blue nail polish fan but this polish has changed my opinion. Very nice deep blue color and quality product, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It is not easy to find a dark blue that looks this good.  This has a slight shimmer.  Looks PERFECT on short nails.  Very trendy.  Absolutely stunning.  Very thick though so be careful when you&#x27;re putting it on.  So worth wearing it.  Only dark blue I will ever use.</li>
    <li> This color is really a very pretty blue. Loved it even more on person. Wear a base coat; my nails were stained blue for several days which looked tacky.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color for the fall and winter.</li>
    <li> Love this color. Such a beautiful hue. Comes just as pictured. Shipping and handling was great as well. It lasted long as well, almost a week.</li>
    <li> good polish, color is accurate</li>
    <li> you simply can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI. lovely colour!!</li>
    <li> I was purchased as a gift and my friend was very satisfied with the color..😉</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful blue almost the color of denim and is shiny.  I have had so many compliments on this color.  Beside, you can not go wrong with OPI.  Their colors are gorgeous.</li>
    <li> The perfect metallic Blue!</li>
    <li> This OPI color is exactly as advertised.  I was after a &#x27;Seahawks&amp;#34; blue - and was very pleased.  GO HAWKS!!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color love OPI</li>
    <li> Love the color.  Price was great &amp; it shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the dark blue polish. It is not quite navy, but perhaps best described as a deep blueberry. It goes on super smooth and is very dark, so you only need one coat. It has a little bit of a metallic sheen to it, so it is not strictly a flat color.</li>
    <li> Love love love it.....</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this shade for pedicures!</li>
    <li> I love the color and i got a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong using OPI polishes! This  color is fabulous and a bear rich navy blue! Truly a favorite of mine.</li>
    <li> May, I never run out. . . At least for now!</li>
    <li> Nice,  thick, glossy and beautiful colour!</li>
    <li> I started using to opi brand last year.  I love how smooth it goes on. It wears really good.I have different shades but this is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great color but it will chip fast, within a week it was very chipped. so make sure you have a really good top coat.</li>
    <li> Love OPI nail polish. I love the color and only use OPI nail polish.</li>
    <li> This is a very cool blue nail polish from OPI! It&#x27;s a really deep, sparkly blue &amp; looks great on!</li>
    <li> Love all colors for nails.</li>
    <li> Great coverage, and long lasting. a super navy/cobalt blue. i wish i had a car this color and shine. I will buy this brand again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding to review, i came back for second bottle. vivid covers well and stays on well.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color!  I&#x27;m really getting into wearing new colors, especially blue!  Love the names of the various polishes!  Speedy delivery and in excellent condition.  Will definitely be placing more orders.</li>
    <li> I really like this polish color,I used about 3 coats to get the same look as the picture.I would definitely recommend this nai polish.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color.  OPI quality is very nice.</li>
    <li> I love this color!  Obsessed with blues at the moment and this fits right in with what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> its more blue than you would think it was&lt;br /&gt;in the bottle it appears to be purple but its very dark&lt;br /&gt;and the service from this seller is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!!</li>
    <li> I love OPI nail polish, but this color stays way longer than you want.  After trying to take it off with their brand remover my nails still remained a sick looking blue.  It took days to get it off from around the nail-cuticle area.</li>
    <li> Like the color but have to use up to 3 coats to get it completely opaque other wise you see light areas through your nails but very nice color</li>
    <li> Honestly, one of my all time favorite blue nail polishes. It&#x27;s a show stopper.</li>
    <li> The wife and daughter have already had many a nail painting party with this one and they say it has already passed the test, best brand out there!  Dries quickly,  does not chip,  and last long!</li>
    <li> Looks even better on. Last a decent amount of time. If you wash your hands a lot and wash dishes, don&#x27;t expect it to last more than a week. Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty polish!</li>
    <li> Beautiful dark blue, perfect for fall/winter, looks just like the picture. I was extremely pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped the product within the specified timeframe.</li>
    <li> Almost black - gorgeous blue - love it!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, great consistency.</li>
    <li> Love this color.  Hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
    <li> This polish is amazing</li>
    <li> I loved this color blue on my nails &amp;#34;Yoga-ta Get This Blue.&amp;#34; It stayed on for a long time like all OPI colors &amp; the nail salon I go to had no problems taking it off. I bring my own nail polish in when I get my nails done.</li>
