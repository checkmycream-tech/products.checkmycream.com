<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Loved this razor! --- The shape of the handle makes it easy to get the job done and the lubricated strip eliminates the need for a lot of shaving cream( i didn&#x27;t use any)..... It was a great  product!  I got mine for free from bzzagent.....I love trying the new products and giving honest feedback.... This razor is a keeper:)</li>
    <li> I found the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor to be only somewhat effective for me. When it comes to removing hair from the legs, the razor worked very well. I enjoyed the moisturizing strips that made the shave a smooth, quick, and simple process. However, when it came to the bikini area I was unable to successfully use the trimming side of the razor simply because I don&#x27;t let my hair &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; get long enough for the trimmer to work effectively. I ended up just using the razor side to clear off the remaining hair and it worked okay, but still left some stubble. I&#x27;d say for legs, the razor worked incredibly well. The smoothest shave I have ever had with no knicks or cuts; plus the results lasted a few days longer so instead of shaving everyday I only had to shave every 2-3 days. However, for me when it comes to the bikini area the trimmer just wasn&#x27;t effective. Thus, I&#x27;d likely not spend the money on a razor where I can only benefit from one of its functions.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor. It gave me a nice close shave and left my skin feeling silky and smooth. I surprisingly wasn&#x27;t super impressed with the bikini trimmer, but I will continue to use it. I dnot think the trimmer really worked at all, but I really was impressed with the actual razor! I got it free from BzzAgent as a promotion from the brand, so I&#x27;m not out any money.</li>
    <li> Got to try this razor through bzzagent and I absolutely love it. It gives a nice close shaveand is definitely worth keeping :-) definitely ditching my old razor!</li>
    <li> Amazing razor! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing!!  It is 2 tools in one and it works great!  It saves time and is easy to use! No problems or issues with it what so ever!  Highly Recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. My review is my own opinion*</li>
    <li> Being 8 months pregnant is has been hard to keep up with shaving my legs and bikini area, mostly because I can&#x27;t see. I had been looking for a razor my husband could use that wouldn&#x27;t leave me all hacked up. Obviously I was a little apprehensive to try this but I said hey why not, and I&#x27;m glad I did. The trimmer was wonderful no nicks no chunks missing from my skin, worked wonders! Thanks Schick and Bzzz Agent glad I was able to try this product!</li>
    <li> Received this for free as a reviewer for BzzAgent Jono.&lt;br /&gt;The product came in very nice packaging meaning it was easy to open!  A plus for me and the battery was included.  The razor is more compact than I expected and this is a plus.  It is no longer or wider than my regular razor.  I read the instructions which are very simple.  It noted that it needs to be stored flat in between uses to protect both ends.&lt;br /&gt;My first use was very successful.  I am impressed.  I was wondering if the regular razor part of the device&#x27;s utility would be sacrificed for the trimmer.  It hasn&#x27;t and it works better than my regular razor which I already loved and is a schick.  There are two moisture serum lines making a very smooth shave.  I used shaving gel but I don&#x27;t think I needed it.  I got a very close shave and it was fast and easy.  Once during my shave I accidentally hit the power button for the trimer but it was no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is definitely a wonderful addition.  It is waterproof!  I love this and didn&#x27;t know I needed it in my life. It worked like a charm and was fast and easy.  I used it with the adjustable comb on several settings.  It was a snap to adjust during my trim with no problem.  No messy creams or dry trimming with messy clean up needed.  A fast process that can be done discreetly in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;This product lives up to its claim as one simple device.  I am sold.  The price point definitely makes this a winner.  This will be a staple not only during summer but all year long.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle razor from BZZ agent to try for free. I love this razor. It made my legs feel amazing.. I could not believe how silky and smooth my legs and bikini area felt after one use of this razor. I will be purchasing this razor in the future. Thanks BZZ agent for giving me the opportunity to try this razor out. I love it!</li>
    <li> I received this amazing razor/trimmer From bzzzagent to try and give my opinion on it well I love it close shave and very silky the trimmer is easy to use on bikini area and it doesn&#x27;t leave bumps or razor burn best product so far! Thank you Schick for letting me get this product free!</li>
    <li> I am a fan of this!  I received a free sample of this from Bzzagent. The razor is a bit bulky due to the trimmer, but it is something you can get used to.  The Trimmer is one of the best ones that I have tried out.  The Razor COULD use a removable guard. That is the ONLY reason I am giving this a 4/5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love that I can use on my legs and bikini area . I was left with a close and clean shave with no irritation or razor bumps . It left my skin soft too. Best razor I have had in a long time.</li>
    <li> The new Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® is a whole new way to shave and trim your lady business in one simple tool. And when combined with the nourishing power of Skintimate® shave gel, it is magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as a pregnant lady, my business is now hard to view and handle so this truly helped me. The trimmer is easy to use, and I am already a fan of Skintimate shave gel and Schick Hydro Silk as it is my daily razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razors and trimmers are expensive, but this is reasonable and worth the use. I can not recommend this enough.I  am thankful to have received a coupon for this from BzzAgent  but will continue to buy it from here on.</li>
    <li> This is so exciting. I always have a hard time finding a good razor that doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin. I have sort of sensitive skin and this razor works amazing. I get such a close shave and my skin is so smooth and silky after and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin which is a major thing for me! I definitely recommend this to anyone who has a hard time finding a good razor or has sensitive skin. This razor works so great! I got this for free from BzzAgent. Thank you BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> I am a bzzagent and this is my bzz. This razor is good but nothing spectacular, I have bought disposable razors that are just as good but none with the bikini trimmer on it. The trimmer is great and very convenient plus it&#x27;s waterproof! I would recommend this product. #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I love this amazing razor!!! When i first opened the box there was instructions on the back of the box on how to use the razor and how ro care for the razor, so that was definiteltly great for me a first time user.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is the first one that i have that looks a bit different from the others i have had. First of all it is battery operated, it has a trimmer with 5 adjustable positions, and it is a little thick. Which they are awesome features, my legs are so sensitive abd shaving is a nighymare since most of yhe times my legs end up irritated and itchy. Honestly i was bit skeptical to use it but I gave it a try, and i am happy!! After shaving one side of my leg i felt my leg so soft and smoth.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product ladies, its worth the expense and will leave you satisfied!</li>
    <li> Great shave and close trim. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I received my Trimstyle Razor from www.bzzagent.com while doing a campaign.  This razor is pretty amazing I have always had an irritation after using a razor but I can honestly say this shave was different.  So far after two days from using this product I have not had any irritation and still feel smooth.  This is a product that makes a great addition to a daily beauty routine and especially for individuals who have sensitive skin and need a product that does the job without causing a constant irritation.  Very effective and affordable while still allowing you to get that smooth skin without having to pay an arm and a leg for a razor and a nice working trimmer.  I definitely will continue to use this product!!!</li>
    <li> I got this for free through Bzzagent to try it. After the first use I notice a difference in the feel of my legs. Usually after I shave them they are dry and need immediate lotion, with this hydrating razor that wasn&#x27;t needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closeness of the shave wasn&#x27;t as brilliant as I usually look for in a razor, but the bikini trimmer is a nice touch that makes up for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line I would recommend this to people, but it works better with shaving cream!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS RAZOR! Yes it is a little pricy but that is worth it. It has adjustable setting and I have never received a smoother shave that lasts so long.</li>
    <li> I get to test out products for free from BzzAgent in return for my opinion,  and here&#x27;s what I think about the the TrimStyle -&lt;br /&gt;First of all the razor.  With 5 blades and a water activated moisture strip,  you get the job done fast and with little irritation.  I have sensitive skin and even on my bikini line,  no razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;Now foe the trimmer.  I like the convenience of it being waterproof,  and can be used wet or dry. I also like that it comes with a blade guide to customize your trim.  However,  without the guard,  on the closest trim,  it felt like it was irritating my skin and left it red.  For a close cut I will stick with the Razor end, but the space, time and effort that the TrimStyle offers makes it a handy little device to have on hand.</li>
    <li> Got it free from bzzagent.com and absolutely love it leaves you silky and smooth plus a close shave</li>
    <li> I love this product, it gets all the hairs. I would recommend this product to others. After using this razor on my legs, it didn&#x27;t feel itchy. When I used the BIC razors, those made my legs itch. I will definitely use this product again. The smoothness of my legs after using it, gives me an oh my gosh kind of feeling. They are usual rough. I got this product free, from BzzAgent, and I am gracious and thankful they chose me to give a review.</li>
    <li> Wow! This razor is the bomb-diggity! Seriously! I&#x27;m the type whose leg hair grows back ten minutes after I&#x27;ve shaved it, but no sir, not this time! It&#x27;s been 24 hours and I&#x27;m still as smooth as a...what&#x27;s something smooth? I can&#x27;t think of anything I&#x27;m as smooth as, so I must be the smoothest thing in the universe! Maybe not, but I&#x27;ve got to be, like, top ten or something...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway...the trimmer is pretty amazing too! I love that the comb is adjustable. It&#x27;s waterproof, so I can take it into the shower with me, which is very nice. It&#x27;s also durable. I should know; I dropped it the second I took it out of the box!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I would totally recommend it to all of my lady friends and family members and possibly some strangers too.</li>
    <li> I got this razor from BzzAgent to review for free and I am so happy that I did. I have been a total men&#x27;s razor junkie for about 4 years now. They just always seemed to out preform our cute colored girly razors. That is until I got this in the mail. My skin is ALWAYS dry when I get out of the shower and I have to apply lotion which is messy and makes it difficult to get skinny jeans on directly after when in a hurry. With this razor I can skip that step! My skin is so smooth and hydrated thanks to the hydrating serum. The razor glided through my &#x27;week of no shaving for this review&#x27; leg hair so smoothly. I have no irritation and no bumps which is fantastic as I have such sensitive skin. I like the lowest setting on the trimstyle but honestly with this I can play around and switch it up. My boyfriend is also wanting a razor just like mine after seeing it haha. If you have not tried this razor yet, you need to because it truly is amazing for legs, underarms and unmentionable areas. I am so bikini ready this summer! *my legs are lotion free in the picture, how crazy!*</li>
    <li> This is one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used. It leaves a close shave and the conditioning strip actually works and is really moisturizing. Definitely recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive this item through  bzzagent a few days ago! I was skeptical about a razor trimmer combo, but I am pleased to say it will be one of my go to products for the summer!! After the first shave, my legs felt silky and moisturized. I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of skin irritation, as i have sensitive skin! The Bikini trimmer also works very well if you have shorter hair that you want to get rid of! Upon trimming the longer hair, it got a little stopped up, but it was nothing a simple cleaning couldn&#x27;t fix! I would definitely recommend this razor to any lady that wants a smooth summer shave !</li>
    <li> I love this razor! It leaves my legs so smooth and soft and no razor burn with the bikini line. That has always been an issue with others razors. It is so easy to use and glides across your skin. I would highly recommend to friends and family. A+</li>
    <li> Overall a good razor.  Nice to have the trimmer component as well. As with other razors that have a moisturizing bar, I noticed that it could sometimes get slimy/sticky on my skin.  This was really the only downfall of the razor, not really an issue just an annoyance.  The product was easy to use and the battery was easy to install.  The packaging did come with directions.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love. This razor is so great. I received it as part of a BZZagent campaign for free and I will definitely purchase in the future Nice close shave, no tugging or pulling. Perfect tool for those getting ready for bikini season. Trim and clear cut all in one tool.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor campaign through BzzAgent and wanted to offer my opinion. The packaging was really appealing, and the idea itself is pretty genius- I especially love the idea of being able to use the trimmer both wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was away for business for a week and came back and thought it would be a good time to test out the razor after not shaving for a week. I wanted to try the trimmer first on my legs to make sure I knew what I was doing. The instructions are awkward because they are printed on the box, so if you rip it open then your instructions will be gone. I didn&#x27;t know which way to trim or how hard I was supposed to press, nor could I tell how close I was trimming because the adjustable head wasn&#x27;t labeled. I randomly slide the head down and tried trimming my leg with no success. I slide down the head to the shortest length, and still didn&#x27;t notice any result on my leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moved on to the razor, and I LOVED it. It was a really smooth, close shave, and didn&#x27;t get any nicks. It was also super moisturizing and my skin was so soft after I shaved. I will say it&#x27;s a bit bulky and awkward to hold because of the trimmer attachment, but not to the point where it is too difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried the trimmer after I got out of the shower, and still didn&#x27;t have much success with it. I feel like your hair has to be pretty long to get a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I would absolutely purchase the razor portion of this combo again, but the trimmer wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I got this very cool trimmer and razor combo from BzzAgent! Great Product!&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited to use it probably because of the cute packaging. Having a 2 in 1 like this makes shaving all areas so much easier. Especially if its been a while! :)&lt;br /&gt;I am very prone to razor burn and hair bumps because I have extremly dry skin, even with a shaving cream and I did notice that I did not get a burn and the bumps were at a minimun. I was very surprised. This is a very handy product and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a super close smooth shave!</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited to try out the new Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor, but also a bit wary too. Wary because I have sensitive skin and usually wax, given that razors usually give me razor burns and ingrown hairs. Also wary because it&#x27;s an electric trimmer and I&#x27;m going to use it in my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have taken a picture of the packaging before I ripped it open because it was very nice. A nice, aesthetically-pleasing design that I felt bad for tearing it apart. The razor came with a AAA battery that you have to twist apart the razor in two to plop it in and get the trimmer working. I liked that because the battery is safe in there, being water proof and twist-locked in. Shaving with it in the shower had no problems, the water activated serum around the blades kept any irritation at bay. I feel like it moisturized my skin, even without using the Skintimate shave gel it recommends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer side seems to work decently in the shower. You just have to really work at it to get all the hairs. It doesn&#x27;t pull, which I was worried about. I think it&#x27;ll be better to use the trimmers on dry hair, wet hair being too pliable and stretchy for trimmers in general. One of my favorite features of this device is the little stand it has to prevent the razor from touching the surface of the shower, preventing rust. How cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is great for in between wax appointments! Perfect for me!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to receive this razor free to try from bzzagent. I already own the regular Schick hydro silk and I love it because it has 5 blades and always leaves my legs silky smooth. The part I was really excited to try was the trimmer. I think it does a good job at trimming, better than trying to trim with scissors and its very handy because you can use it in the shower. However, the trim wasn&#x27;t as close as I would&#x27;ve liked even on the lowest setting. I did take the guard off to try that way and I got a few very tiny cuts so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that. Overall its a good trimmer but not if you like a very close trim.</li>
    <li> I had never heard about Schick 2 in 1 razor before. After receiving mine for free I tried it out and fell in love. This has been the best razor I have ever used. I love the fact that there is a trimmer on the other end. This is the best thing they ever could have made. I also love the way my skin feels after using the razor it leaves my skin so moistured. Thanks for letting me become a new customer.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve used! I received one of these through Bzzagent and was so excited to try it! Super close shave and easy to use. Plus the batteries were included! Great product!</li>
    <li> This was a GREAT razor!! It left my legs sooo smooth and NO stubble left behind!!!! I love the moisture that it leaves during and after the shave, it gave me a really close shave and a longer lasting shave, which is unheard of for me!!! The trimmer portion wasn&#x27;t the greatest though, it left my bikini area very irritated, that&#x27;s just me though, it might be different for you! But all in all, GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I got this item in buzz agent and I loved it Loved it works great in shower haven&#x27;t tried it out of shower but love it it&#x27;s double sided so u only have 1 razor 2 sides 😃 leaves skin really smooth enjoyed using in will be buying refills with the coupins that where provided great item thinks buzz agent 😃👍</li>
    <li> I received a free Schick Hydro Trimstyle from Bzzagent,  I was reluctant at first I have tried other brands of trimmers for women without much luck, but this one was amazing the trimmer worked well and it&#x27;s water proof so you can use it in the shower or bath. When your done trimming you flip it over and your razor is right there!! The razor also worked wonders I usually use men&#x27;s razor cause I feel like the blades are usually sharper and you get a better shave but the was probably the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used!! It was a an amazingly smith close save and moisture strip worked wonder my legs felt great when I was done, not a trace of razor burn!!!!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this razor that I got from BzzAgent because I have a regular Schick Hydro razor and love it. Right out of the package, I am a fan. The razor is more cylindrical than normal razors in order to have space for a battery, but that didn&#x27;t bother me at all, it was still pretty ergonomic and comfortable in my hand. The grip on the razor is fantastic, I didn&#x27;t drop the razor once!  And THE RAZOR IS NOT PINK!! It&#x27;s actually this soothing blue color with ripples, true to the Hydro name.  When I first used it to shave my armpits, I got annoyed thinking it wasn&#x27;t doing anything because I wasn&#x27;t feeling the familiar tugging/scraping. But then I looked (and felt) and my armpit was completely smooth, as if I never had hair in the first place! I shaved my legs and when I was almost done leg 2, I realized that I forgot to use soap or shaving lotion, the moisture strip was that good! Afterwords, my husband wouldn&#x27;t stop touching my legs, telling me how soft and smooth they were. My only complaint is that by week two the moisture strip is wearing away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric side is what makes this razor unique. It has a cap that prevents you from getting too close or nicking yourself, but that cap is easily removed for a closer shave or for easy cleaning. I got a nice even shave that did not even hurt or pull, like I feared it would. It&#x27;s great that it can be used in the shower  - which makes for easy clean up. I can definitely see integrating this into my shower routine.</li>
    <li> I love love this razor! First off I received this free from bzzagent to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is easy to hold and comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;It has tons of blades that gets a really close shave. The head bends nicely for knees and armpits. The moisture strip is great no shaving cream needed. It gets such a close shave I usually find myself having to shave the next day my legs are still smooth from shaving yesterday!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor it&#x27;s great!!</li>
    <li> Recieved this from bzzagent and I have to say it&#x27;s my favorite campaign to date! Love the ease of use and the option for different lengths! This is my go to razor from now on. My legs feel silky smooth after using my Schlick hydro silk trim style.</li>
    <li> Received a free product from BzzAgent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Trimmer is awesome! i loved it! had no problems with it whatsoever! the razor on the other hand is just too gooey in my opinion especially when your applying shaving gel.. i couldn&#x27;t even feel like it was doing its job i was honestly real dissapointed when it started to release all that good i had to take the whole shaving gel off with water for it to actually do its job. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for myself to be honest.... thanks for the opportunity BzzAgent &amp; Schick!</li>
    <li> I have officially become a fan of this TrimStyle razor. I especially loved the soapy stuff that forms when water is added to it. it didn&#x27;t cut me at all, and I could shave hard to reach places that I couldn&#x27;t do with a regular stick razor. what I liked most though, is that you can use it in the shower and water will not ruin the battery inside, because the seal for the battery compartment is very tight.</li>
    <li> I received the NEW Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor from  BzzAgent complementary for reviewing purposes. When I first received the product I instantly was drawn to the bright, pretty packaging. The product was packaged very nicely and instructions were very clear. I was so happy to see that batteries were included because that would have been frustrating. When I first held that razor I had two thoughts. It is definitely much bulkier that any other razor I have ever used and I was worried about bringing the product in the shower because of the batteries. I am worried overtime that the product may rust. After the first time I used the razor I fell in love with the shape and bulkiness. It is much easier to handle and gives a very close shave. I also had no problems after bringing it in the shower. I open is up and absolutely no water got inside. It was completely dry. I highly recommend this product and definitely think its worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love love love this razor makes my legs so soft and gives a close shave</li>
    <li> I received this free from bzzagent to test out. Im glad that I accepted to do this campaign because honestly I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve never used a razor as great as this one! It makes my skin extremely smooth afterwards! Plus I love that the bikini trimmer is waterproof, so it could be used in or out of the shower!</li>
    <li> After receiving the Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® for free to try, I could not wait to get in the shower! I loved that it was easy to hold, and super easy to use! If wanted, you don&#x27;t even need to use a bunch of soap or shaving cream with this razor because the silky moisturizing strips work wonders. This was also the first bikini trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I really loved the ease of it and how adjustable the trimmer was. It&#x27;s very quick and left my body smooth and silky as promised! I shave my legs almost daily now, just to get to use this amazing razor.</li>
    <li> The closest shave on my legs I&#x27;ve ever gotten, and a great tool for the bikini area as well. My one recommendation would be to provide more instructions on how to use the trimmer. I had to youtube it, as someone that has only used manual razors in the past. Once I figured it out, though, it was successful and I found I had to remove hair less often than I have in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone. It&#x27;s light and easy to travel with, and is nice on the skin. No more razor burn!</li>
    <li> This razor is fantastic overall when it comes to giving a smooth shave, as well as having the option to use the electric waterproof trimmer. This is a wonderful 2-1 razor. It has done well in making my legs feel smooth and soft. I do have a few complaints, the first being that I wish the razor came with a hanger or cradle so that I could safely put my razor down onto something. I made the mistake of placing the razor face down onto a wash cloth and it got stuck to it. So of course now the wonderful little shave gel strip is ruined. The razor is also a bit large for shaving my armpits. I have managed to get the job done, but with some difficulty. Overall it&#x27;s a great razor though, and I appreciate BzzAgent for providing me the free product to try.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my  Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle®!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need a different razor ever again. The razor part is amazing. When I used it in the shower to shave, it gave me the closest shave I could imagine. When I was done shaving, it left my legs feeling so soft and moisturized, even without any lotion! My legs feel like my 8 month old daughters!  The bikini trimmer part is just as wonderful! It can be used in the shower or out, wet or dry! That&#x27;s one of my favorite parts about the trimmer. I trimmed up my bikini area in the shower, using the comb connection it came with. It definitely does its job! It gave me a great close shave the way I wanted it to. I&#x27;m 100% bikini/swimming/summer ready with this gem!! I love every part of the  Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle®! I&#x27;ll never touch another razor that&#x27;s for sure! Thanks bzzagent for the free sample! !</li>
    <li> I received my razor just a week ago and I absolutely love it! The trimmer is quiet and works wonderfully. The adjustable head is such a great feature. the water activated moisturizing serum leaves my skin silky smooth! I will definitely be recommending this razor to family and friends!!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from BzzAgent.com and though I believe this razor gives a fabulous, super close shave, I still think it has a few flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used my Schick Hydro Silk Trim Style on four separate occasions now.  I absolutely LOVED it the first day I used it.  Trimmed my bikini area beautifully and with ease while in the shower.  The razor made my legs super smooth without any razor burn, but it was so sharp I nicked myself a few times in places I&#x27;ve never nicked before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an easel/kickstand to keep the razor from touching anything else, which will keep the blades sharper longer and is a great added feature. However, it causes the silk gel (to prevent razor burn) that is inside the razor head to ooze out in between uses.  All my gel collected at the base of my razor causing me to nick myself a few more times every shave since the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wish the angle of the razor handle were a few more degrees closer to 45, so my hand wouldn&#x27;t have to be as close to my leg when shaving straight.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample to try it out and was surprisingly pleased! The trimmer is very user-friendly and powerful enough without being crazy loud. I would definitely keep this on hand for a quick trim.</li>
    <li> This razor did a wonderful job on my legs when I decided to try this for the first time. It allowed for a quick fix when I was on the go,leaving my legs smooth and soft in a matter of minutes. The trimmer is a nice added touch and so is the vibration which was not at all intimidating unlike some trimmers that sound like a lawn mower. I would definitely recommend this product to any and all women out there.</li>
    <li> Alright so I got this product yesterday thanks to BzzzzAgent. It was sent as a free product to try out and give my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it once so far but wanted to give my initial thoughts after my first go around. Should I change my mind in subsequent shaves, I&#x27;ll update accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So off the back I was surprised by the sheer size of this product. Loved the package it came in. Very every catching. With the blues and purples, it definitely appealed to the female crowd quickly. The light blue of the product itself appealed to my four year old son. Upon opening the package I was once again surprised by the hefty weight that it had. It was certainly fancier than any razor I had ever bought. It looked like it meant serious business with both end presenting cutting options. He battery through me and I&#x27;ll be honest. The first day I got it and opened it all and couldn&#x27;t figure out what and where that darn battery should go. The second day I was determined. You must twist the middle of the thick center and pull the razor apart in order to add the battery. Once put back together you simple press the fancy blue button closer to the small razor head end. It gives a soft whirling noise and shakes uncontrollably in ones hands. Very entertaining for someone like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the shaving portion now. As soon as I did the first glide I understood entirely why they called it Hyrdo Silk. It glided on so smoothly and lightly, I had to wonder if it even touched my skin. I know it was on my skin as I felt the cold of the metallic blades but I never once felt the trail to let me know where it started or ended. After three strokes I gave up relying on my sense of feeling and relied on good old eyesight. Was happier than I care to admit as I saw a thick matting of hair on the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did both legs and the whole time I was left to wonder if the blades actually touched my skin. I never felt anything but a cool hand glide lotion on my legs. That is seriously all it felt like. The rubber syrrou ding the blades feel similar to the old Venus razor that provides the built in shaving lotion around the blades. It has a very smoothly, slick texture although upon a deeper press you can easily tell its rubber and not, in fact, lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wide girth and needy weight made it very easy to grip this. Usually I buy the second cheapest razors out there so this was damn near heaven in comparison. Since the handle is a rubber base it makes gripping it all very easy. With my old ones, I would have to tighten my grip if water touched my hand or even worse, soap where to coat the handle. A few times my finger slipped and pressed the bikini trimmer button and I would immediately feel the tremble of the razor. Luckily though my hand was never never it to produce any damage. He bikini trimmer looked too intimidating to test out tonight and plus, I had already run out of hot water so I settles for legs and underarms. Both of which are baby smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the razor and only knocked off one star due to not having it long enough to give a full, accurate review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend? Oh heack yes! This is a very smooth gliding razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will it rust? My thoughts exactly as I examined it after the shower. For the most part the handle itself won&#x27;t but the blades itself most likely will. Anything metal will rust given time, especially when introduced to water frequently enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I enjoy it? It was a fun experiment and I was excited for it when I opened the box!egs. That is seriously all it felt like.

    <li> Recently I&#x27;ve found myself not too thrilled with the razor I had previously loved, and trying to find a new razor that met my expectations wasn&#x27;t going too well. Then  I received the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle thanks to Schick and BzzAgent, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out to see how it held up. My first impression was that it was a little bulky due to the fact that it has a battery for the trimmer, but while using it, I quickly adjusted to it. I was a little hesitant to try an electric trimmer for my bikini area, so decided I&#x27;d get that out of the way first. For me, all of the lengths available through the trim cover were too long, so I opted to use it without the cover. I experienced some redness because of this, but it was gone by the time I finished showering, and overall it did a pretty good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I then moved on to the actual razor part, which I was excited to try. Both with and without shaving cream, I was able to shave effortlessly and didn&#x27;t experience any nicks or cuts. Typically I have very dry skin, and even with after using lotion after shaving, within a few hours my skin is dry and itchy, but with this, I applied just a little lotion and didn&#x27;t have any problems with dry or itchy skin! Even better, to keep my legs smooth, I normally have to shave just about every day. With the Hydro Silk TrimStyle, I&#x27;m on day 3 and only just now starting to get a little stubble.</li>
    <li> awesome great close shave and very hydrating edges. love the bikini trimmer and the multiple settings. i found my new favorite razor.</li>
    <li> Received this razor as a promotion. This razor works great! It gets the job done, unlike any other razor I have used. It is relatively quiet as well! I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I got this from bzzagent, it is a really great product! It meets multiple needs and it&#x27;s super easy to use!</li>
    <li> I received a free trial of this as a promotion from Schick, and I cannot say how disappointed I was in the product.  I would suggest a men&#x27;s razor if you are looking for all that this product touts it to be.</li>
    <li> I just tried this razor , I got it from bzzagent! I have used Schick razors before but I must say this one is def the best! It Definitely get a close shave! My legs feel so soft and smooth. I have always hard a hard time find a good razor cause my skin is very sensitive and they break out but this one doesn&#x27;t do that at all, and the trimmer is amazing! I would definitely recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> This razor is very cool for someone who usually prefers the Schick Hydro Silk razors because it comes with the added bonus of a trimmer. I received it free to try from Bzzagent. The trimmer is great, it&#x27;s not too heavy but not too light. It&#x27;s just heavy enough to feel like a quality razor, but kind of a low quality trimmer with a light plastic-y feel. That&#x27;s okay though because it&#x27;s portable and waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Moisturizer works well, adjustable trimmer guard, nice gender neutral colors, waterproof, portable&lt;br /&gt;Cons: On button sticks so it takes a couple presses to turn it on or off, moisturizer runs out long before the blades dull, I can see myself losing the trimmer guard.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor! I got it for free in a campaign at BzzAgent.com and it&#x27;s the best razor I have ever used. Everything about this razor is perfect and it truely makes your legs silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I got this razor/trimmer for free from Schick and BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely loved the razor!  It&#x27;s moisturizing 5 blade razor head gave me the smoothest shave I think I have ever had.  There was no snagging as I shaved.  The razor glides so smoothly over the leg that it almost seems as if there are no blades at all, but the smooth skin left behind definitely proves you are getting a perfect shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer part I was not as impressed with.  The guard on the trimmer does have an adjustable comb, but even at the 0 setting the trim wasn&#x27;t close enough for the close shave that I prefer.  The guard on the trimmer was easy to adjust and to remove for cleaning.  Also the trimmer is easy to turn on and off with a simple push of the power button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor/trimmer to anyone who already uses and electric trimmer and is looking for an option they could use both in and out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free thanks to BzzAgent! And wow! This razor is IMPRESSIVE! Sure, the handle took me awhile to understand since it&#x27;s thicker than what I am used too, but I love the results! My legs have seriously never been smoother! And they are so shiny! I love the how easy it glides on your legs, and I didn&#x27;t even nick myself, which seems to happen using other brands. This razor is a must have!</li>
    <li> best razor ever need to say more</li>
    <li> Awesome Razor! I love that it is a 2-1 razor. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I #GotItFree from BzzAgent as a promotion from Schick to provide my opinion on the product and I really like it! The dual end allows a great close shave that lasts for days!</li>
    <li> I decided to give myself a spa day in the comfort of my home. I was so excited to try the new Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle that I was fortunate to receive from BuzzAgent for testing and reviewing purposes. In all honesty, I hadn&#x27;t done my weekly leg shaving or every other week bikini care. Now before you say anything, I&#x27;m 6 months pregnant. So it&#x27;s kind of difficult to bend over and see below my waist but I was determined to test this product out.  I managed to shave my legs first. I&#x27;m a schick hydro silk lover already. It&#x27;s my go to razor. I knew it was just as great as their other razors I own. It glides easily on your skin and leaves it feeling smooth. You don&#x27;t need to add any pressure.  Now the difficult part was going to be trimming. I didn&#x27;t like that they hadn&#x27;t provided or made a security cap for the razor end. One can easily cut themselves during the process, so remove the razor end like I did. I was able to trim the areas I could reach and to my surprise it did a good job because trust me, I really need it. So I noticed the big difference. It didn&#x27;t pull my hair in any way. I just trimmed away. The parts are not difficult to remove, so it&#x27;s easy to clean. Be careful not to have my luck. I placed the razor back on but didn&#x27;t notice it hadn&#x27;t been placed correctly, so when I shock It to remove some water, the razor end fell directly into the drain hole and drained away but on the bright side they provide a $4 Refill coupon that I can pair up with a $2 Refill Target coupon to get it cheaper.</li>
    <li> I #GotItFree from BzzAgent as a promotion from Schick to give my honest opinion and my honest opinion is that this razor ROCKS!&lt;br /&gt;As a mom quiet relaxing time is hard to come by.  When I got my package with my Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor, however, I sure found some! I was super excited to try it out and was not disappointed. On the contrary, I loved it! It glided very smooth and silky and my legs feel smooth and moisturized and summer ready! I keep feeling my legs because they have never been so soft or smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I do have a recommendation for improvement. There needs to a cover for the razer part while using the bikini trimmer. Next time I&#x27;ll probably take the head off but I just hate having to do that everytime. Razor blades make me nervous. Maybe while you&#x27;re at it also find a safer way to change the heads for worry warts like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Schick for the opportunity to try out this razor!</li>
    <li> I got schick hydro silk trimstyler free with bzzagent and this is by far my favorite razor so far. I have sensitive skin that gets itchy and red from other razors but this razor did not cause any reactions. Plus trimming was made easier since I am 32 weeks pregnant</li>
    <li> this is the best shaver i ever seen or used. i highly recomend it. its the first shaver ive tried that doesnt hurt when trying to shave the bikini lines.</li>
    <li> Was really impressed with this razor. Never had tried a non-disposable razor but glad I did thanks to the BzzAgent campaign. It gives a nice, clean shave and I find myself not breaking out in rashes or cutting myself nearly as often as I did while using disposable razors. I feel like someone who trimmed more than I did would find more use out of this razor.</li>
    <li> i got this razor as part of a promotion by Schick and i cant be happier. my legs have never been smoother and well neither has my bikini area. i will continue to use it long after im done with the promotion. i used it the night i got it, which honestly was a God send. I hadnt shaved this week and i figured this would be a good test. working 12 hour days on my feet makes me a tired person so shaving sometimes gets left out. well the results were better than i expected. i didnt get a single cut or pinch like some trimmer do. sorry im ranting. so to sum it all up im in love with this razor and would recommend it to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> This is a great new razor and bikini trimmer, it does leave my legs smooth without my legs looking red. Also, I don&#x27;t feel it pull out my hairs and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I recommend this razor and trimmer it was given to me as a free sample by BzzAgent. I will be buying replacement cartridges for it next time I go shopping</li>
    <li> Loved this ! So easy to use and its not too big best of all its waterproof  !!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m practical.  And a 2-in-1 razor/trimmer sounded practical to me even though I had no idea how to use a trimmer...so I signed up for the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor campaign through BzzAgent.  Allow me to fill you in on my first impressions, razor usage and trimmer usage.  I am BzzAgent Angneld.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions: The packaging was nice and I didn&#x27;t have to get out a chainsaw to open it.  The razor is a bit chunkier than a typical razor, but it has a sturdy manageable feel.  It made me happy to see that a battery was included with it to run the trimmer.  To get the battery in, I recommend putting the flat part of the battery in first then twisting the razor together.  Hidden under the cardboard back insert were helpful pics and instructions on the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor usage:  The razor part shaves nice and close, leaving my legs feel smooth and moisturized.  It did miss some random patches of hair even though I went over most areas twice.  Also, every time I rinsed the blades out in the water, a large drop of drool would come off of the razor head.  It made me wonder how long the moisturizer could last if that much came out so easily.  Overall, the razor was good, but the drooling was not super impressive for all the hype on its HydroSilky properties.  I attached a picture of what the razor looked like after its first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer usage:  Ok, I&#x27;ll confess- I had no idea how to use a trimmer so I YouTubed it.  The how to videos were all shown trimming men&#x27;s beards.  From them, I learned how to hold the razor (with the blades parallel to the skin).  Also, I learned that shaving up (or against the hair) will remove more hair than shaving down (or with the hair).  There is a bit of an art to trimming if you&#x27;re not going to hack everything off, so take some care.  The trimmer has four settings.  Three of the settings are found by adjusting the casing while the fourth setting is found by taking the casing off.  I would have never dreamed of using a trimmer before but it is just what I needed.  Using the guard is nice, because then I didn&#x27;t have to worry at all about pinching my skin, like scissors would (and did).  Taking off the guard is nice for a super close cut that is more gentle on skin than a razor, if you&#x27;re careful.  The one downside to the trimmer is that hair will get stuck inside it and I&#x27;m not the best at cleaning it out.  I tried rinsing it out (probably a bad idea), then I used a Q-tip.  But hairs were still stuck in there as you can see in my pic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product because of it enlightening me on the powers of a trimmer.  The fact that there&#x27;s a razor stuck on the other end is just a bonus to me.  I will probably never live without  a trimmer again...d of using a trimmer before but it is just what I needed.

    <li> Super handy tool! The trimmer tool works really well and it&#x27;s just damned helpful that you flip it around to shave. The razor part is quality, but the real  advantage is that it&#x27;s got both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received a free razor as part of a promotional campaign.)</li>
    <li> So let me start by saying I got this product for free from bzzagent to try in return for reviews and feedback. I was excited when I was selected for this mission as I look as shaving as &amp;#34;me time&amp;#34; to get away from my troubles and relax.&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the package, I didn&#x27;t like that the razor part of this duo didn&#x27;t come with a cover but I was able to remove the head and got over that quickly. I figured out where to put the battery pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;In the shower I was able to test out the trimmer. I like a close trim so using the closest of three setting for the trimmer guard did the trick. Very easy to use. The razor side was dedicated to my legs and underarms. I really like the serum that is water activated on the razor side. It left my legs very smooth, no razor burn, no missed hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of a trimmer and shaver all in one. It makes it convenient to just flip around and trim/shave where you need it. And I also love that it is water proof.</li>
    <li> I received Schick&#x27;s Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini Trimmer as a free product from BzzAgent. As with everything I get sent from BzzAgent, I was very excited to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is enticing, and is definitely something that would catch my eye at the store. Inside the package is detailed instructions on how to use the razor and trimmer. It also explains how to change the battery, which is easily done by simply twisting the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the razor is a bit bulky to accommodate for the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor blade has both a moisturizing strip and little holes that moisturizer comes out of. This gave me a very smooth shave! The razor even has a built in stand so the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t get on anything while I am not using it. This is a nice feature because I have had trouble with this happening to other razors I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially loved how the razor blade just glided over my legs and contoured to my knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is a nice extra, but not something I would use regularly.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Bzz-Agent, and now it&#x27;s my new favorite razor!! My legs are soo smooth!! And the bikini trimmer works amazingly. My boyfriend actually uses it for his tattoo! It&#x27;s gentle for sensitive skin, which I have. It&#x27;s perfect! I would suggest you to buy this razor now if you haven&#x27;t already!</li>
    <li> I go to try one of these out free through BzzAgent, but Schick never fails to disappoint. I&#x27;ve been happily using the schick hydro, and then the schick hydro sensitive for years. It&#x27;s one of the few razors that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and gives me a good, smooth, long lasting shave. This device uses the same razor so that is still true here&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for an added bonus, they&#x27;ve added a trimmer, which works just as well as my husbands higher dollar conair trimmer at a fraction of the price. It&#x27;s conveniently located on the opposite end of the razor so it takes care of everything in one visit to the bath or shower. You have to twist the device to insert and remove the single AAA battery required, but after you get it figured out its straight forward. I removed one star because it can be just a tad more awkward to shave with then the regular schick hydro as my hand tends to bump the on button for the trimmer</li>
    <li> Bzz Agent sent me a free sample and I love it. The razor have me a close shave and the trimmer left me bikini ready. Best new feature is the resting arm. You can put the razor down and the blade won&#x27;t touch the sink or the tub !!! Great product. A must have for Summer.</li>
    <li> I received a free one from BzzAgent to try out and this is the best razor I have ever used! It&#x27;s very hydrating and it goes on so smooth. The razor even has an adjustable comb.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving my legs. PERIOD!  Now that I have gotten above the age of 40 and  am non-petite it is even more of a struggle to shave ... specially THOSE areas. I got this razor as a free sample from BuzzAgent and I thought ... seriously? OK First let me start off with the handle,  this handle is just the perfect grip. The rubberized coating makes it very easy to hold.  The bend of this handle is very realistic, have you ever gotten a razor and though &amp;#34;exactly did they design this shape for&amp;#34;? This razor was made for YOUR hand!  The 5 blade head.  I am not ashamed to tell you I have swiped my husbands razor from time to time and he likes those 4 blade heads that are huge! When I saw this 5 blade I thought are you kidding me! With the first swipe I was in love! Not only dose this head swivel forward and back wards the head itself moves up and down on a track!  I do not have perfect Iman legs personally but this head just slid right up over all the bumps, divots, varicose veins, knobs , scars and all the other blah that are my legs.  At no point did I nick, chip, slice, dice, or generally lacerate any part of my anatomy with the first use of this razor! That within itself is a major miracle!  Now the ... other end of the razor.  Again previously I have been forced to barrow my husbands beard trimmer to ... neaten the neighborhood up a bit ... and it was an extremely uncomfortable procedure. Scratches from the metal plate where the razor blade was, hair pulled out from the root, uneven thatch marks ... just horrible.  Laying on a towel on the bed trying to be neat while trimming all this like a yoga master! I got in the shower and did my legs, then took a deep breath and thought OK ... here we go. Took a handful of Skintimate shave cream and got the parts that needed covered covered. I turned on the razor with one push and liked that it didnt vibrate so much my hand went numb, parts could go missing that way! I adjusted the guard to the highest level and went at it. That trimming head glided smoothly through that shaving cream, efficiently took care of the yard work, never felt any scraping or pulling, rinsed off quickly and did a very quick job of everything! Had I had this when I was younger my life choices may have been drastically different!  For the first time in a very long time I am excited that summer is here and I can wear shorts and a swimsuit because the maintenance is going to be SO much easier!it.

    <li> I recently received this as part of campaign so I got to try it for free and was very excited about it.  I am very picky when it comes to my razors because I get razor burn very easily.  I am happy to report that I did not get on bump from this razor.  I also really appreciated that they gave a battery in the package for the trimmer part.  Not many products include the battery so that was nice.  I am one of those women who don&#x27;t shave during the winter months so I used the trimmer to trim up my bikini line and then used the razor to get a nice close shave.  The nice thing about the trimmer is that you can adjust it.  I don&#x27;t know if I would be happy with the closest shave the trimmer gets for my bikini line because it was still a little prickly.  For what I used it for it worked perfectly.  If I wanted to just use the trimmer for my bikini line I don&#x27;t think it would give a close enough shave and that&#x27;s why it got four stars.  Overall it is very easy to use and I would purchase this in the store.  It would be worth my money.</li>
    <li> I normally use the Schick Hydro Silk razors, so to get a free one to try out via BzzAgent was a great opportunity! I love these razors as they actually hydrate as you shave and help me to prevent getting a lot of those nasty scratches and bumps when shaving. As for the trimmer, I think this idea is pretty ingenious if it continues to hold up to the water use of the shower! The trimmer seemed to work just fine for me and gave me a close enough trim that I wanted. I could say that the adjustable levels of trim option is a bit flimsy and comes off easily if you are not careful when adjusting levels. I worry that the trimmer won&#x27;t hold up to all the water and moisture of the shower and won&#x27;t work after a month or so, but only time will tell. The only other thing I could suggest needs an improvement is that I would like a protective cover/covering for the razor side when it&#x27;s not in use as the box did not provide one and I tend to have the dropsies a lot, so a covering would be much appreciated!</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing! I received it for free from BzzAgent, and I&#x27;ve used the same disposable razors for years so I was excited to have a chance to try something new. It was a little intimidating when first opening the package--the handle is much larger (wider/bulkier) than other razors I&#x27;ve used but I was hooked after one use. The larger handle actually makes it easier to use and the razor side glides SO smoothly--it feels like you don&#x27;t even need shaving cream. The trim side is also great. It&#x27;s operated by a AAA battery and works perfectly, trimming nice and short without feeling like you&#x27;re going to accidentally cut yourself. I highly recommend this razor--especially with summer and bathing suit season coming up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time user of this specific product and I am completely satisfied! The shave was smooth, slick, close and easy. I love the fact that the razor has its own stand so when you set it down l, the blade isn&#x27;t touching anything! LOVE IT. It also has very soft grips so it&#x27;s easy to hold onto when your shavings. The only issue I had was that the smooth part of the razor that surrounds the actual razor, started coming out the next day after I tried it. Other than that, this has been a very happy experience with this razor. I would definitely recommend and purchase in the near future!</li>
    <li> I got this product free from Bzz Agents to try out and all I can say is this razor is perfect. I love the fact that it&#x27;s a razor and bikini trimmer in one. With the moisturizing strips and the 5 blades you can&#x27;t get any closer a shave but my favorite part has to be the pivoting head so you don&#x27;t cut yourself around tricky areas like your knees.</li>
    <li> REVIEW BY LIFEPRINCESS ON BZZAGENT.COM/ I got this free through Schick and Bzzagent.com. This razor is amazing. It&#x27;s easy to use with a nice design and grip. It provides a nice, smooth shave with no knicks or catching/pulling of the hair. The trimmer is nice is you keep a maintained bush but useless if you go really short or bald. Otherwise a great razor.</li>
    <li> I was not overly impressed by this razor at all.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.) The razor does have a nice smooth close shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.) It&#x27;s really much too bulky, I have small hands and it&#x27;s hard to hold it comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;2.) I guess you really need to grow things out for the trimmer to be effective? I tried it and all it really did was irritate my skin&lt;br /&gt;3. ) There&#x27;s so much extra stuff around the razor itself that I had to actually keep popping it out in order to clean it out.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free from bzzagent and I love it.  Every woman needs to buy one.</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a promotion from the brand but I really like this razor and would definitely pay this price for it. The gel strip is wonderful and the head is very flexible. It makes shaving a lot easier and faster. Shaving is so much quicker now. I do also enjoy the bikini trimmer. It does take a second of holding the on/off button for it to completely work. But, I like the different settings that it offers and the ease of use. The head is really easy to change. I enjoy this razor.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick hydro silk trimstyle from bzz agent for free to try out. For the last several months I have been using A Venus razor that just didn&#x27;t love me that close shave I really wanted. As soon as my Schick came in the mail I couldnt Wait to try it out. Best razor I have ever used. It left my legs so soft and smooth. The trimmer was an added bonus. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another razor again!</li>
    <li> I got this product completely free from bzzagent.com to test. I alway wanted to try this but could not afford to pay that much but now that I did i this I would wasted the money I love this razor</li>
    <li> Seriously love this razor! When I received this razor for a promotion campaign I was very iffy at first but now im im love! The razor is amazing and leaves your legs really smooth, the trimmer makes things so much easier and quicker!! Must have especially for summer time!</li>
    <li> I have never previously used a bikini trimmer, so this was new for me. I am currently very pregnant so I can&#x27;t even see that area, so the adjustable trimmer with the guide came in extra handy. It worked well, as did the razor itself, although the razor did leave my legs feeling a little itchy, but I have very sensitive skin. Also, there is a little stand attached to the razor so you can sit it on the side of the tub without the blades touching, which is nice. One weird thing to me was that the instructions are printed on the inside back of the box, which made them kind of hard to see. The product is not difficult to use, so you don&#x27;t really need instructions, but it still seemed like a weird place to print them. A removable insert would be better. I got this razor free from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> This razor is the best of both worlds! I received it through a Bzz agent campaign as a promotion and fell instantaneously in love with it. After using it several times I saw how convenient it was with the dual heads. It made trimming the bikini area really easy and it gave a smooth finish. I want to try it with the silk cream just to see how smoother it could get. But overall I was quite impressed.</li>
    <li> First,  I have to say that this razor is very pleasing aesthetically. I love the color and, despite the trimmer and battery,  it&#x27;s not that heavy.  But the razor leaves something to be desired. It glides over legs like a dream, but I don&#x27;t recommend using this on your underarms.</li>
    <li> I did receive this product as a promotion from the brand but my following review is completely honest. My first impression of this razor is that I love it,  I am not one to rock a hairless kitty so the trimmer really appeals to me. I think the buzzer has a learning curve but It works really well. I tried the shaving end with body wash and just with water in the shower and both gave an amazingly silkly feel to my legs. I have to say I think I&#x27;m dropping my stolen from my boyfriend razor and keeping this one.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I wanted to know how good/bad this product is, so to be able to do that I decided not to shave when I ought to because I was expecting this product from bzzagent. Having said that.... This is an amazing product, It gives a close a shave and leave your skin super moisturized!!!! I also love that you can use it either in or out of  shower. It is light weight yet durable and gets the job done in an amazing way. Thank you BzzAgent for the opportunity of trying this product before purchasing . I will definitely purchase  and continue to use this product. It is shaving made easy! Oh!! did I mention the $4 off the Refil/Razor....and $1 off the shaving gel Coupons? LOL!!! You guys rocks!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample on the schick hydro silk trim style razor through bzzagent. The first day i tried it the cartridge strip was slimey. I used it with body wash and my legs became irritated and itchy. I decided to try for a second day before writing a review. Today i used with shaving cream and same thing my legs became irritated and itchy. I love schick and is the only brand that i buy. I don&#x27;t think this razor is good for people with sensitive skin like myself. I will stick with the sensitive skin cartridges which i love. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this type of razor. Really disappointed i didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Got this item from bzzagent to review and i love it gets a nice close cut shave</li>
    <li> I really like this razor. It&#x27;s a easy to use  2 in 1 tool for shaving. The razor makes my skin very smooth without any cuts. I would recommend this to anyone. I received this razor/trimmer for free to review.</li>
    <li> I received a free one of these from BzzAgent/Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An impressive little tool, the removable comb/shield works well for trimming close to the skin before shaving. I prefer not to shave my bikini area so I&#x27;ve been using the electric trimmer mostly. It&#x27;s hard to say exactly how close the shave is without the guide on it, but I don&#x27;t mind some stubble so it was fine for me.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I received it free from BzzAgent to try and review. It works so well! I love the ease of use. The bikini trimmer is my favorite part! It&#x27;s so easy and I don&#x27;t have to worry about irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My very first experience with shaving as a young girl (I shaved when I was like 10, swim team)  was with a schick.  3 blades is what my mother wielded me with to battle my young hairy legs. As I got older and a job I moved to the Venus. It had rounded edges and we loved each other. Schick and I broke up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I saw this razor come up to try,(bzz agent, I give my own opinion, received it free.)  I was skeptical at first, Venus has been so good to me and gentle, but then I saw it,&lt;br /&gt;5 Blades.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give my first love a go again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my box arrived I was psyched about it and how legit the razor looked. Plus the coupons were greatly received with applause.  Now as I opened it up and thought, crud it needs a battery, then wait, low and behold IT COMES WITH ITS BATTERY. And not a junk knock off brand I might add. So as I looked it over I was  like ok. We&#x27;ll give this bad boy a go tonight. Now I have very sensitive legs, like if I don&#x27;t shave right or with enough oil( coconut oil) I have the WORST bumps and break out in a&lt;br /&gt;rash. It&#x27;s very sexy. I could seduce an alligator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor end:&lt;br /&gt;As I watered it up, I was impressed but also kind of not excited about how gooey it became. Made me wonder how long this moisturizer was gonna last. If it was just gonna melt off in 2 shaves. (Used all week and still gooey.)&lt;br /&gt;Gooey stuff was Moisturizing as I shaved and didn&#x27;t reek of perfumes that would bother my skin.  It was annoying some what though because I had to constantly rinse the razor so it would actually reach my legs to shave.  I still have a love hate relationship with the &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34;. Now as those 5 blades moved across my cactus legs, I was like &amp;#34;where  have you BEEN ALL MY LIFE.&amp;#34;  Great close shave, definitely &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; smooth. They ain&#x27;t lying. Now the handle on this bad boy is BIG. I&#x27;m not crazy about it. I have small hands for a woman tho so it definitely is going to be preference. Getting into small places to shave while holding onto this large handled razor wasn&#x27;t easy or my fave. But with as close a shave and as smooth as it was I wasn&#x27;t backing down from this handle.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;Ok so. I really don&#x27;t need a &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34;, razor does awesome. Specially this new one.&lt;br /&gt;So I can&#x27;t say what I think of the trimmer on myself. Now my husband has a little hair on the back of his neck/hairline that grows faster then his regular hair so I went ahead and used it on him. Worked great, liked the idea that it was water proof so I could do it for him while he was in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end. Schick has mended our broken relationship. Do I need the trimmer and razor. Probably not. Will I buy the razor again? YES.  Heck yes.ndled razor wasn&#x27;t easy or my fave. But with as close a shave and as smooth as it was I wasn&#x27;t backing down from this handle. Trimmer: Ok so. I really don&#x27;t need a &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34;, razor does awesome. Specially this new one.  So I can&#x27;t say what I think of the trimmer on myself.

    <li> I was very excited to receive this product for free from BzzAgent to review  and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. I have very dark, course hair and the fact that the razor was able to give me such a moisturizing and enjoyable shave without use of shaving cream was very impressive ( I used shaving cream with it once as well so far, but I really wanted to see how it performed without any and it rocked)! The trimmer was a little bit of a let down. I had trouble getting a close shave even without the guard on. Maybe I was using it wrong? But for the price, I think it was a great and useful addition. I like having a separate shaving apparatus for my more sensitive areas. All in all, I would definitely recommend this razor to friends and family members, especially for the summer months when you need to stay soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> I did not buy this from amazon but got for being a buzzagent. I could not wait til I could try this out. It give a amazing close shave like no other. The trimmer is a great bonus that you can do all of it the shower, the trimmer get really close as well. I love that it has five blades, no many women razors have five blades but this one does. My husband was curious and tried the trimmer for his chest and he loves it as well. He wants to know when the male verison is coming out</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited to use the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle, especially since it has five razor blades-- a must for some of us who are unfortunately on the hairier side of things. The Schick Hydro Silk disposable razor is my go-to, so I couldn&#x27;t help but compare them as I used the TrimStyle. The TrimStyle did a great job of giving me a close shave, but the razor felt a bit flimsy. The original Hydro Silk has a blade that contours to the curves of your body as you shave, but that same blade on the TrimStyle felt as though it could come off at any minute. My legs also didn&#x27;t feel as smooth as I shaved with the TrimStyle. The adjustable trimmer is probably a great addition for those who know how to use it, but as someone who has never used an electric shaver, I was a little lost! Some negatives aside, the TrimStyle is a nice razor for those of us who have a little bit more body hair to get rid of.</li>
    <li> Got it free from BZZ agent! I love this razor. It definitely won over my legs. I didn&#x27;t have any razor burn and the trimmer is an awesome addition. I will defiantly buy this next time!</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle for free from the brand to test out and review and here are my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle is a 2-in-1 system that has a 5-blade razor on one end and a battery-powered bikini trimmer on the other. Used the razor on my legs and it does indeed give a close shave. Since the razor has a strip of conditioning serum attached, I was able to just wet my legs in the shower and shave with no razor burns afterward. Note that once the razor is wet, the serum does leave a gooey layer on you as you shave over the area, but it&#x27;s easy to rinse this away in the shower. After getting out of the shower I did not notice my legs being significantly moisturized by the razor&#x27;s serum, but it didn&#x27;t dry my legs out either. Also, I did not experience any allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the bikini trimmer - I was definitely more impressed with this end of the product! The trimmer is turned on by pressing on a button and can be used in the shower or out even though it is AAA-battery powered since it was built to be waterproof. I&#x27;ve used in both inside and out of the shower and while it does work while wet, I prefer to trim outside of the shower as I find it less messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer has 4 length settings, which can be easily adjusted by manually pushing the plastic comb in for a shorter trim length or pulling the comb out for a longer trim. I used the 2nd longest trim length and went over my entire bikini area, trimmed in an upward direction, and am very happy with the results as I think the trimmer thins out the hair more evenly without looking choppy like it would if I used a scissor. I do appreciate that the trimmer helps accumulate the hair in its comb, leaving no mess on the floor and allowing you to pick it all up together with a tissue or wash it away. (This might depend on how much hair there is and how long it is, but this was my experience.) The remaining hair was very easy to clean by removing the comb and rinsing the clipper.  All-in-all, using the Hydro Silk TrimStyle bikini trimmer yielded a straight-forward, easy, and neat trim for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one criticism that stuck out to me is that the razor end does not come with a cover so when using the trimmer I had to be mindful of how I held the product. This is not to say that the razor would easily cut me while I trimmed, but it was just in the back of my mind and a cover may have helped alleviate this concern. Also a cover would be beneficial for storing the razor when I&#x27;m not using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I&#x27;d say that the trimmer makes this product worth it if the product is priced at retail (which I believe is less than $15?)and rinsing the clipper.

    <li> I have used both the trimmer and razor ends of this handy little tool and overall I really like it. I received this free from BzzAgent but I have used the product on my own and all opinions are mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer - this was quick and easy to use and the size of the head is just right. It was difficult to get the trimmer to stay on (they even say in the directions that you do not have to hold it down to shave - meaning you need to press really hard to engage the button) but later on I discovered why (see following part about the razor). My complaints about the trimmer end are that the trimmer does not mark on the body where &amp;#34;1, 2, 3, and 4&amp;#34; are, so it can be difficult to determine what setting you are on, and also that there are no directions or instructions as to how close the various settings are. I chose setting #2 and it was a much closer trim than I prefer. Hopefully this will be fixed in future editions of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor - a nice razor with a close shave. I did get a nick, but that could be user error as it was only one and I didn&#x27;t feel it at all. The main problem with the razor is how difficult it is to hold! I kept accidentally pressing the power button for the trimmer - no wonder they make you push so hard to keep it on (see above). I struggled with finding the right way to hold this for comfortable and efficient shaving. The grip is a nice silicone, though, and made it easy to hold on without dropping it, a concern that I had due to its weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great product. It is so easy to use the two products in one! Makes grooming a lot more convenient. ;)</li>
    <li> I really liked my Schick hydro.  As soon as I got my Schick I used it and I have to say I will keep using the product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I recieved this razor through BzzAgent as a free sample/review sample. While I&#x27;m am quite pleased with the razor side I do not much care for the &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; side. The whole razor is a bit too clunky and overwhelming in my shower. It, unlike many others, does not come with a &amp;#34;hook&amp;#34; or even a stand. I do however quite enjoy the waterproof part of it.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free as part of a campaign from BzzAgent! Regardless, all opinions are 100% my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the new Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor &amp; trimmer! I have tried tons of razors and this one has me feeling things I have never felt before! Instantly, after shaving, my legs feel SUPER smooth, and don&#x27;t get dry and itchy after couple of hours. It is comfortable to the hand while using it, the battery is really well protected from the water, and you don&#x27;t have to keep the on/off button pressed to use the trimmer. Another thing that is a little detail but makes a huge difference is the small &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; it has, as soon as you are done, you clean the razor and put it down resting on the stand so it doesn&#x27;t touch any surface while it dries. I have only had it for couple of days and I already can tell you that I CANNOT live without this razor. Plus, did I tell you that it also is a trimmer (with adjustable trim length!), so the fact that I have 2 things in 1 makes it perfect, especially for me that I&#x27;m always traveling (less bulk) and swimming with my little one (bikini ready)!</li>
    <li> This razor is incredible! Not only is the trimmer precise, it&#x27;s gentle. The blade on the razor is like no other I have used!! It leaves your skin super silky, NO bumps!! I #gotitfree through #bzzagent but I will be paying for the refills for sure! Absolutely incredible!</li>
    <li> Before I used this I thought I was in for just another regular shave from another regular razor but I was highly mistaken! Until now I used Gillette because I found the 5 blades and vibration to have the best shave. Not only does this Schick have the same wonderful qualities as my beloved Gillette, I belive this has surpassed my expectations. The wide head makes shaving faster with less strokes, and it was by far the closest shave I&#x27;ve felt EVER. It took almost 2 days for stubble to come back in my bikini area when normally its a matter of 12 hours sometimes when I would have normally felt stubble. I recommend this product 100%</li>
    <li> The New Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® razor is amazing. It is waterproof and can be used in and out of the shower making shaving so convenient unlike others.it has an adjustable comb that has four settings for trim length .I also love the moisturizing serum nice for my sensitive skin giving me a clean look and feel&lt;br /&gt;Received from buzzagent to try for free</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product! It is the best combination of ease of utility you can ask for in a grooming product! I left it in the shower and have noticed that my boyfriend has been using it too for his chest and beard trim-ups.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> It is waterproof, has a great adjustable comb on the bikini trimmer which is awesome! I love it. I am a bzz agent and received this for product for free. I think I found my new favorite razor! This one is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Did not buy through Amazon but did get it free from bzzagent. This razor is amazing. My favorite part is the bikini trimmer, it does not leave any razor bumps and also has multiple settings. The razor provides a clean close shave and does not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Schick brand I&#x27;ve used it for years, I have the Schick Quattro trimmer and that is one of my favorites, I received this as a tester for bzzagent and I used it last night to test out &amp; let me say its just as good if not better than my other one. I will definitely be switching to this one....</li>
    <li> I received this for free from BzzAgent. I absolutely love it! It is quick and easy to use. Saves me time in the shower.  Only requires 1 aaa battery  which Is included in the package!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive the Hydro Silk Trim Style. I love the idea of a razor and trimmer in one. The razor has 5 blades with a built in hypoallergenic serum. I shaved one leg with shaving cream and the other with just the blade with serum. I was really surprised that the side with no shaving cream was just as smooth with a great close shave. It gave almost a soap lather feel. I only had go over the leg one time as compared to other razors that I have to shave the same area several times to get a close shave. The 5 blade technology definitely gives a close shave. I have very sensitive skin and have not noticed any razor burn. The trim option is also very handy. The battery was very easy to install with a simple twist design it was vibrating like a charm. The trimmer has a removable comb that can adjust for different hair lengths. The trimmer obviously doesn&#x27;t give as smooth or close of a shave as the razor but I was still very impressed with how sharp it was and it worked very well. The trim style is very compact and lays flat for easy storage. Overall a awesome product!</li>
    <li> This razor, oh my gosh this razor is the best. No lie I have not shaves in a week now and still no stubles, on top of this I use the shaver part and shaved my boyfriend&#x27;s Facebook and trimmed his hair it worked awesome it didn&#x27;t pull his hair or anything. We both love this razor very much. But see I got mine for bzz agent they are an awesome place</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m odd, very picky about my razors. So when I got a notification that I had been selected to try the TrumStyle razor I was hesitant.  I was rather excited though, having a tool offered to me that could accomplish two things with just one razor. So I got my razor, tried it out, my legs are still completely smooth 24 hours later.  I tried the clippers part out, was scared but it gave me a nice, close shave. I call this razor a must-have and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Well all i have to say is i love this product i received it free from bzzagent.com i use this for my legs today in i bought the cream from the coupons tgat came with it and im loveing it. It makes your legs fill smooth its also easy to use.i love it it works in if you reading this you will like it this is a good razor</li>
    <li> This razor is great. My legs and bikini line have never been so soft and smooth. Love it.</li>
    <li> The razor blade is very smooth on the skin without worrying about cutting yourself. All you need to do is put a little shaving cream and after your skin feels so smooth.</li>
    <li> Amazing close shave, nice gummy handle, protective strips on shaver head are nice. The battery buzzer on the end is perfect for picking one up at your CVS and going to the beach after.</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing!!! I waited very impatiently to get it from bzzagent and was kind of a hairy beast when it arrived. I wanted to make sure I got the full value of my review. Well my legs are amazing!! I got a super close shave and my skin is so soft. I even tried one leg with shaving cream and one without. Honestly there was really no difference between the two. It&#x27;s great!! I think this might be my new razor.</li>
    <li> I love this razor!  Let me start by saying that I usually buy the store brand disposable razors at the grocery store so this was a huge improvement for me.  I think my favorite thing about the razor is that it isn&#x27;t just a bikini trimmer.  It is so nice that it can be used as your regular everyday razor too, and it doesn&#x27;t just do an ok job of this.  It does a great job.  I don&#x27;t know if it is just the moisturizing strip on it or what, but my legs feel so smooth after using it!  As for the bikini trimmer part, it is a little awkward to get the hang of in my opinion, but it gets the job done.  This razor is way better than any of the store brand disposables I&#x27;m used to and I plan on sticking with it.</li>
    <li> I switched from Venus embrace and instantly noticed a difference. It is bigger and a bit more bulkier but I don&#x27;t mind it. The razor is a much better shave and the trim side is super easy to use for those certain areas! I also love how when you set it down the razor doesn&#x27;t touch the bathtub.Very close shave that left my legs feeling like silk. Literally. No exaggeration. The trimmer was also very useful. I always used to use the regular electric shavers and they were always too bulky. This product is great! I love the fact you can adjust the trimming length. The top pops off easy for fast cleaning and it stores away in a small drawer. Plus the fact it&#x27;s safe in the shower is great also.10/10&lt;br /&gt; *I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> Used this product for the first time the other day and it is absolutely worth trying. I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding a razor that would give me a great sliky smooth cut but this one did the job.</li>
    <li> I personally love this razor. I would recommend it to anyone.  IT makes it so much easier to shave now. If your wanting to be summer ready get this razor!</li>
    <li> I love my new razor/trimmer combo it really shaves the time down on my grooming routine the fact that it is waterproof and moisturizing at the same time is amazing. I received mine free through bzzagent but that in no way affects my opinion. i used to dread the winter thaw because that meant next would be the spring shedding of all that extra hair when you start whipping out the shorts and such but this really changed my mind! i have to problem with wearing shorts or showing of my newly silky smooth legs thanks to the trimstyle.</li>
    <li> I had been debating whether to try the schick hydro silk trim style and was excited when this came in the mail as a promotion from the brand!  I waited until I was due for a shaving before using this product and used it in my normal routine. I have nothing but good thing to say about the razor side. My legs felt moisturized and smooth. It was the easiest shave I&#x27;ve experienced and the razor glided around my legs with no discomfort. I wasn&#x27;t as much of a fan of the trimmer. I felt like the three adjustable lengths were all very similar and didn&#x27;t let me trim enough. It wasn&#x27;t as easy to use as the razor side and I kept having to rake over the area to successfully trim it. My usual trimming routine seemed to be quicker and easier than using the schick hydro silk trimmer side. I rated it 4 stars because the razor itself was a 5 star razor and I think that makes the product &amp;#34;worth&amp;#34; it.</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;i love schick razors, i believe it the best razors for women. i have tried mens razors to get a close shave and i was left unimpressed. this one is really great because it 2 in 1! my only complaint is that the handle is bulkier and not as ergonomic, buti get it, the handle is the battery chamber. it not a deal breaker for me but for some it might be</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try this product through BuzzAgent, and was very anxious to try the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor mainly for the trimming portion. I&#x27;ve used various Schick razors in the past, so I knew the Hydro Silk razor portion would be amazing. Unfortunately, the &amp;#34;TrimStyle&amp;#34; portion of the razor was a bit disappointing. I intentionally let my bikini area get a bit &amp;#34;untidy&amp;#34; for a few weeks to test out the trimmer. Upon the first try, I noticed that the razor took a few passes to just trim the area. This may be a bit too personal, but I prefer a fully shaved bikini area, so I used the trimmer to just trim the hair then I went over the trimmed area with the Hydro Silk part of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was BLOWN AWAY with the razor portion. For some reason, it exceeded all razors that I&#x27;ve tried in the past. It produced an insanely close shave, with zero irritation (really - no bumps!). I also loved the actual design of the razor - it has a triangle stand under the razor portion so that the razor head never touches your bathtub. All razors should have that simple triangle stand!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this item from Amazon, (got it from bzzagent.com), but it is amazing. I have sensitive skin, and have a hard time finding razors that give me a super close shave without giving me severe razor burn. I have always been a fan of Schick products, so I was excited to try this razor. The 5 blades provide a close shave with zero skin irritation! The bikini trimmer is a perfect added bonus. It made it easy to combine two somewhat tedious chores with minimal fuss. Wonderful razor!!</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I have thrown out all my old razors and replaced them with this one. I received this as a free gift to try (bzzagent) and am so impressed. It gives a smooth soft shave and the trimmer is perfect for trimming in a pinch. It is a bit bulky, but it travels well. I take the razor head off and take the trimmer with me. Absolutely love this razor!</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® razor from BzzAgent and was excited to try it. I&#x27;ve always wanted a razor that tailors to the bikini line, and not only does this razor have the trimming capability (with different lengths), the other side has FIVE blades with moisturizing strips on both sides. My favorite features:&lt;br /&gt;— Close shave with NO razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;— The trimmer side is easy to use and very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;— The bottom of the razor has a little stand to keep it propped up and off surfaces. I&#x27;m switching from my usual Venus razors to this Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® razor because it&#x27;s honestly the best one I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> I recieved my Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® razor in the mail for free as I am a BZZ agent.  I was so excited for the opportunity to try out a new razor!  Upon receiving the razor I decided, against my natural instinct, to wait a few days before trying out the product.  I typically use a Men&#x27;s Gillette razor as I have never been satisfied with a women&#x27;s razor.  Oh my goodness, the Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® razor is the most amazing razor ever!  I couldn&#x27;t believe, even after only one stroke my skin was bare, smooth and literally silky.  Even without the use of shaving cream or hair conditioner and a few days of growth, this razor has surpassed the ability of all other razors.  I even yelled out several times with excitement and amazement while using this razor!  I find armpits and bony parts are the most difficult to shave and I had no issues.  The flexible blade allowed easy movement leaving no nicks and cuts or stubble and strays behind.  This razor is nothing short of amazing.  I give it five stars but wish I could give it more :). My only critiques that don&#x27;t effect the score are that the handle is thicker than a similar battery operated razor which makes it harder to hold but not impossible, presumably for the trimmer on the end.  Also, I turned the razor powe on several times while shaving as the button seems to be right where I hold the razor.  The solution was to remove the battery, no big deal.  Lastly, although the trimmer with two levels of closeness is ingenious, I have no need for a trimmer as I prefer a close shave.  Truly an A+ product!  Thank you Schick for getting this right!  Updates on review as I continue to shave.</li>
    <li> This razor is comfortable enough to use every day! and it is easy to clean and I love the fact that I can use it in the shower. most other trimmers that I have tried say that they are waterproof but they end up &amp;#34;biting&amp;#34; when used wet, but this trimmer just fells soft. The razor is the best I&#x27;ve tried since the Schick Quattro came out. I get to try this product out from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I really liked how soft this razor made my legs. Unfortunately (since my hair grows thickly and quickly) the softness did not last long. However, while my hair was gone, this razor made my legs incredibly soft! The trimmer was very convenient and I have even caught my bf using a few times. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> All my body hair had been growing for a solid month, so I somewhat resembled a cave woman. But thanks to Shick Hydro Slim Trim style razor (which I received for free via bzzagent) I&#x27;m now as bald and smooth as new born baby. Within 10 minutes I got the smoothest, closest shave I ever had in my entire life. It&#x27;s not just for legs and bikini lines it great for underarms too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying how nice it is to have something all in one, as a Bzzagent I was given this for free to try as long as I provided my honest feedback (no problem there).  I always use Schick products for shaving but haven&#x27;t tried this new product they just came out with.  Not only do you get a really nice clean shave with the saver but you also get the trimmer on the other side...all in one gadget that is worth every penny in my opinion!  And then to top it off you get to select the length of the trim you want because it has an adjustable length setting! Battery provided in the package so you don&#x27;t have to worry about not being able to use all the features right away because you forgot to grab a battery, like I always do!  The moisturizing serium provided on the razor is great and lasted a long time!  Nothing negative to say about this tool.  One that will be staying my house for sure!</li>
    <li> Awesome close shave and so convenient!</li>
    <li> Love this thing! Summer is just around the corner, and it&#x27;s always such a daunting task to groom your nether regions after a long winter. I don&#x27;t necessarily want everything off either, I just don&#x27;t want to channel the 70&#x27;s and feel like a feral animal...The problem is, there was never anything I could do about it. I had to shave/wax it all off... unless i wanted to sit in an awkward position and cautiously use the scissors, and let&#x27;s face it, that never ends up looking aesthetically pleasing. Alas! No longer! The trimmer on this thing worked wonderfully! And if I decide after that I do want everything off, it preps everything so nicely.  As for the razor, what&#x27;s not to love? It&#x27;s got like 5 blades...If 5 blades don&#x27;t work on you, you must be part grizzly bear.</li>
    <li> I just received my Trimstyle Razor from bzzagent the other day and I tried it last night and fell in love. The razor just gives the closest smoothest shave even without shaving cream. I love it, and the trimmer part well I was worried about getting it wet(even tho it said it was water proof) but the little thing just kept on a buzzing and let me tell you there where places that got groomed that haven&#x27;t been groomed in a while and I will keep it at that. Ha this is such a great little product and I think it will be hanging around my bathroom for a while.</li>
    <li> I got this as my first free sample from BzzAgent. And I am really happy about it. The razor for the TrimStyle glides so smoothly across my skin! And the trimmer does an excellent job without sticking or missing any spots. It is a little tricky to get used to holding the trimmer at the proper angle, but once you do it&#x27;s great. I used both with shave gel, but the razor probably doesn&#x27;t even need it because of the hydrating beads on it, which is awesome when I&#x27;m in a rush but really need to shave my legs. Both sides gave me a very close shave that is lasting! I do wish it came with something to put it on the shower wall, like the regular razors, but it may not because of the battery inside and either way I am still very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Free from BzzAgent! Love the blade. Don&#x27;t use the trimmer though. Seems that it would work well.</li>
    <li> fabulous product! love it!</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! It so nice to be able to use both features at the same time!!! I am a big fan of the hydro silk razor by itself together they are awesome!! My legs feel silky smooth and no razor burn on my bikini area. It is a little bulky but its so easy to get used to its way better than having to keep up with two separate razors. Not too fond of the suction cup case but I have not found any that actually stick like they are supposed to and it could always be my shower that&#x27;s the problem. I have been waiting for a great razor and I&#x27;m so happy that bzzagent let me try this wonderful product...I will definately keep buying the refills.  #GOTITFREE from bzzagent</li>
    <li> I got this product for BzzAgent and Schick to try for FREE&lt;br /&gt;I have to say it looks so cool! I love the color!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install battery you just twist it in the middle. I love having the razor on one side and the trimmer on the other side it&#x27;s so convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Not heavy at all! So easy to use! Left my legs SUPER silky and smooth! Will definitely be getting good use of my Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle.&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve loved if it came with a suction piece to hang up in the shower.</li>
    <li> I love this so much  .. It really isn&#x27;t like other razors I&#x27;ve used.. Leaves my skin smooth and soft.. No irritations or anything since I&#x27;ve used it  It&#x27;s super easy to use and I&#x27;m happy I got to review this product.. I definitely recommend for people to buy this :)))</li>
    <li> Amazing! Like seriously the best razor ever a girls best friend!! I got this razor from bzzagent to review it and i have to say i was really skeptical about using it because it said no irritation no burn and i have sensitive skin so im always getting cut but this really improved shaving my legs and making them feel smooth and feel good i would recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
    <li> I love this razor! Normally I use Venus for my refillable razors but I was able to try this for free and I&#x27;m so impressed. I love the adjustable trimmer. The only problem I had was accidentally turning the trimmer on while shaving but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. I just had to hold it a different way. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this razor! #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I received this razor/trimmer for free from BzzAgent, and I absolutely love it! The razor leaves your skin very soft and smooth without having to use shave gel, and it gives a very close shave. The trimmer side is adjustable so you can get the length you prefer. I do wish it came with an accessory to hang it in the shower, but the razor side is elevated when you set it down so it&#x27;s not a big deal. I will definitely buy replacement heads when needed!</li>
    <li> It works great! I was a little skeptical about a water proof electric trimmer, but sure enough, it works great in the shower! The moisturizer on the blades was amazing as well!!! I got mine via a product trial from Schick and am so glad I did!</li>
    <li> Received this item from Schick and BzzAgent for free.. It&#x27;s true what they say. The best things in life are free.. Cause my legs haven&#x27;t felt more silky since .... I DONT REALLY REMEMBER! Lol the trimmer is getting for just getting freshen up. i recommend this product 100%... :)</li>
    <li> Great razor! I got it free from BZZAgent to try. I have to say its a little bigger than regular razors, so a bit clunky. And the trimmer didn&#x27;t trim so much as pull. But the razor part of this is excellent, close shave and hydrating, no need for shaving cream!</li>
    <li> The razor part glides down your legs no problems with nicks. The moisture bar on top of the blade is hypoallergenic for sensitive skin. The trimming part is a great and unique feature for women and it is waterproof! My only complaint is that the trimming cap is tough to pull and adjust with wet fingers in the shower. But overall you are getting exactly as the description says! #GotItFree  for testing purposes only from #BzzAgent so this is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor is the best razor I have ever used in my life. I&#x27;m not over exaggerating either! It&#x27;s dual 2in1 design with the leg and bikini care end cannot be beat. It&#x27;s so easy to use and is so convenient that it&#x27;s all in one. With a busy lifestyle it&#x27;s the perfect solution to cut down shower time. Schick has really outdone themeselves and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor! Thank you Bzzagent for this opportunity. Bring on summer, the beach, pool parties and bikinis! With Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor I am ready!</li>
    <li> Received this Trimmer/Razor free from BuzzAgent Ok - so I usually use my husbands buzzer to &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; up the lady areas and usually end up injuring myself one way or another lol. To start with packaging - like any other razor it was a pain to open but that is not a big deal to me. The grip and style is good not as bulky as most others because it is a thinner razor. The trimmer , in my opinion, is awesome to have. Its thin and small enough to get to areas you need it to get to without the fear of chopping or pinching other areas because it is too long or too big so that is a plus. Being able to take it into the shower another plus because its annoying to have to trim elsewhere. I am a mother so getting a certain amount of time alone is hard. The razor part for your legs I like. My legs were incredibly soft and smooth however, I feel like too much of the coating/gel comes off at one time. At one point I thought it was so thick I was going to have to go back over it because I didn&#x27;t get the hair. I do like the hydrating formula because usually after shaving my legs are super dry and I lotion right afterwards.  It definitely keeps your skin hydrated and smooth.  I am satisfied with it I feel like I have the smoothest legs I have ever gotten  from a razor and the best part, NO IRRITATION! No cuts, no bleeding, no pinching, no nicks, no bumps! I love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor! This is probably the most high quality razor I&#x27;ve ever had. I don&#x27;t use shaving cream so I love the moisturizing band which eliminates the need for cream. The movable head glides easily over my knees with no nicks. This razor is marketed toward use around the bikini line and it rocks it. With other razors around the bikini line, I would either get razor burn or miss spots entirely but not with this one. Extremely close shave and sharp blades means no going over the same spot 100 times, irritating the  sensitive bikini line. The main feature that sets this apart from other razors is the built in trimmer with adjustable guide comb. This is perfect for those of us who want a little flair...down there. The trimmer is battery powered and waterproof so you can leave it in the shower. I would suggest though not using the trimmer in the shower with wet hair. I did it to my boyfriend&#x27;s chest fro and the results were....hilarious. The hair just doesn&#x27;t lay right when it&#x27;s wet so the trimmer gouges some spots and skips others. But if you use it as intended (on dry hair) its high powered, quick, and accurate. I definitely recommend this razor to not only those with bikini line drama, but for use on the whole body as well. 5 stars. I got this razor as a promotion through BzzAgent so I got to try this for free, and I&#x27;m very glad I was able to be a part of this campaign. Very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I received my Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle from Bzzagent free. And I honestly love it! This is the best razor I have ever used it leaves my skin feeling super smooth and I don&#x27;t have to worry about bumps or scratches thanks to the great moisturizing strip.</li>
    <li> I received at schick hydro silk trim style razor through bzzagent. The package is included a two sided razor and a battery. One side is a normal moisturizing razor and the other side has a bikini line trimmer. The regular side of the razor is great. It made my skin very smooth. The other razor, the bikini line electric razor was very rough. It reminds me of an electric razor used on men to buzz their hair. I used it once and couldn&#x27;t continue using it because it physically hurt to use the razor. The regular side of the razor is great. I have really sensitive skin and the razor didn&#x27;t make my skin flare up like some razors I&#x27;ve used in the past. I would give this razor a 6/10. I probably won&#x27;t invest in any refills for the razor. I want to thank bzzagent and schick for letting me try out the product.</li>
    <li> So I received my free razor in the mail and I love it.  I typically get my razors monthly through the mail through a subscription service, but I&#x27;m totally considering cancelling that!  I tried it for the first time last night, and my legs feel softer than every.  Typically I am prepared to lotion immediately afterwards, but I didn&#x27;t even have to do that.  The strip was very moisturizing and I woke up without any razor burn.  The trimmer was also very handy. I had never used a trimmer before, so I feel a bit spoiled now.  It was very easy to figure out, and I was able to choose the length I wanted.  I wasn&#x27;t afraid of cutting myself at all!  The refills are so reasonably priced also.  A win in my book!</li>
    <li> I love this product, and every girl should own one!!!</li>
    <li> I received this complementary from BzzAgent, and its something I would NEVER have bought otherwise, because I&#x27;ve always used scissors to trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I am converted after using this razor/trimmer combo, I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to scissors. The Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle is easier, neater, looks better, and more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened my new razor I was immediately impressed by the design. It features attractive colors and the battery is easily replaced by twisting one end off to reveal the cartridge. It is WATERPROOF which means you can use the trimmer in the shower, you can trim and shave and rise the blade while the trimmer is on! This cuts down on the time of your routine. The razor feels nice in your hand which is a plus, it makes it easier to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer has 4 settings for length of trim, you can adjust this with the comb on the end. I used the 2nd shortest setting and I got a nice, even trim. The comb is removable for the shortest setting and this also makes the trimmer easy to clean. The razor is possibly the most comfortable razor I&#x27;ve ever used, I couldn&#x27;t even feel the blades and I had to check to make sure it was even working. But yes, I had a nice close shave that lasted several days, and no razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely I recommend this razor, and if you&#x27;re considering whether you want a trimmer, do it! It makes everything so much easier!</li>
    <li> This razor is a life savor! it makes my legs feel so smooth and on top of that has a trimmer on the opposite side, what more could you ask for! Awesome!</li>
    <li> What an awesome 2 in 1 razor! I love this close shave that Hydro Silk has always offered, but the Trimstyle (that I recieved FREE from a Schick promotion for review) offers even more! It gets me bikini ready faster, with an easy-to-use 2 in 1 system!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from bzzagent for review, all opinions are my own. This razor is my new favorite! I wnot be using any others now. I have very sensitive skin and this is the first razor I have ever tried that didn&#x27;t leave any cuts or irritation. The trimmer is really handy to have together with the razor. The 5 blades give me a super close shave and I can finally wear shorts and skirts without worrying about having bumps on my legs!!</li>
    <li> I thought that it was going to be a cheap razor, but it was nothing I thought it was going to be. it made my legs so smooth and soft. I really recommend this for every person to try! I got it from the best website in the world BzzAgent. GO sign up they will give you tons of free products, all you have to do is surveys.</li>
    <li> BATTERIES ARE INCLUDED- I loved seeing that a razor comes with the battery already included. Most razors that have great quality like this one require you to spend more money on a battery to allow it to even do it&#x27;s job! The Silk Trim Style Razor was FANTASTIC! It gave me such a close, clean and smooth shave! I loved the Bikini trimmer, and not having to switch to another razor. Yay for it benig water proof as well, and the weight and grip was perfect on this razor. It was so easy to handle and maneuver while using it. I think my husband even got a little jealous by this razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you BzzAgent for sending this to me for free for review!</li>
    <li> I never used an electronic type of razor before, that being said I found this was very easy to use and instructions are very clear on how to use it.  It trimmed my hair very nicely on the lowest setting, however it missed some spots so i just used the razor side and finished shaving. I felt as though I was using my husband&#x27;s face buzzer because they are very similar to the small face trimmers that men use. It will take some getting used to but I will be keeping this in my routine. The razor is also very nice with the hypoallergenic moisturizing serum, its great and makes my legs feel very smooth. I got this for free from being a BzzAgent, my opinion is my own.</li>
    <li> Love this razor combo.  I received this razor to sample through BzzAgent and I am so glad I did.  There are different levels for the trimmer so I was able to find the perfect level and did not get a single nick.  The razor side is just like the single refills that I use, they last a long time</li>
    <li> Thanks to bzzagent and schick I was able to try this razor/trimmer for free! I really liked how moisturizing the razor was, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had such a close smooth save without razor burn or any little cuts. I don&#x27;t foresee the trimmer getting a whole lot of use but I like that that portion can also be used while showering! This is one of the best razors I&#x27;ve had! I normally get disposable ones where I need to shave over areas twice. But with this razor I only need to go over an area once! This is pretty amazing since I will admit during the winter I get lazy with shaving so I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a while so the hairs were pretty long :/ with my other razors when they were that long I&#x27;d have to go over areas at least twice but with this razor it was only once! Awesome! For all those other reviewers who got cut, the key is to not go over an area twice because I made the mistake of going over just one area again an I got nicked. BUT that has been the only nick since I&#x27;ve used it. So there&#x27;s one tip. But over all, I didn&#x27;t need to use a shaving cream or anything! Just water :)</li>
    <li> This is such a great razor! My legs are so so smooth and silky! I got it for free from bzzagent and honestly I would have paid every penny for this!</li>
    <li> I received this to sample as part of a Schick brand sampling from BzzAgent, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that this thing is amazing!  The blades shave well and are easy to clean.  The trimmer doesn&#x27;t pinch as long as I have the guard on and it makes trimming &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; quick and painless.  I honestly can&#x27;t recommend this thing enough.  I plan to never be without it!</li>
    <li> Loving my new Schick Hydrosilk Trimstyle razor that I received as part of a promotion from the brand via BzzAgent! The adjustable trimmer is awesome! I had been using my husbands trimmer before receiving this product (much to his chagrin) but I&#x27;m so happy then I&#x27;ll have one of my own in this great combo product! My legs are smooth, moisturized, and not irritated despite being sensitive to many razors. My bikini area is &amp;#34;bikini ready&amp;#34; for our upcoming warm-weather vacation. This is my new HG of razors!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a free sample from bzzagent. My overall impression is a positive one. I love the close, clean shave from the razor. And I love the fact that it has a trimmer as well. Only dislike is, is that you have to hold the button down. I am so happy I got a chance to get this razor. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. The trim function works well and it very convenient. I recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their bikini line under control.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for free from BzzAgent and I was so excited when I recieved it! As soon as I got it in the mail I got in the shower to try it out. It left my legs feeling silky soft and the bikini trimmer is a great bonus! Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I got mine from Buzzagent, tried it and it&#x27;s better than any other razors I&#x27;ve had so far. It left me legs hydrated, smooth and silky, the trimmer was also great. My skin is sensitive and after using my last razor my skin would be itchy, dry and lots of red little lump, with this new 2 in 1 Schick, no itch, no driness, and no lumps. Overall, I recommen.&lt;br /&gt;#gotitfree</li>
    <li> I usually use a small pair of scissors to trim up for the summer, and it can be really tricky to get the job done without taking of anything important lol. This trimmer is easy to use and you do not have to worry about getting cut in the process.</li>
    <li> So I rarely write a review on here but  did want to tell everyone about the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini trimmer that I recieved from BzzAgent for free. It is funny because as I am writing this a customer for it just came on. First off if any of you are trying to decide from this version and the older cheaper version let me assure you that this version is so much better. They are both waterproof which by the way is awesome because you can use it in the shower. They also have a trimmer comb that has 4 settings to include the setting of taking the whole trimmer comb off. They both are very easy to clean the hair out of which as a woman of color is a really big deal. That means that there is less time in the shower because it rinses off the first time around.&lt;br /&gt;The differences that I have noticed are that there are 5 curve sensing blades which are awesome, they glide so smooth like. The biggest difference between the two that I have noticed and am totally in love with is the part of cleaning the trimmer. With the older version the only way to clean the trimmer was to remove the trimmer blade with a screwdriver. With this version all you have to do is push back on it. So much easier. I never cleaned the other one because I did not feel like getting a screwdriver but after cleaning the Hydro Silk I now see it needs to be cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;Well with all that saying I love this product and believe it is a God send for every woman especially woman of color. Oh and on a side note t does not snag on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;#GotItFree</li>
    <li> This razor is beyond awesome! I will definitely be purchasing again, my legs were so smooth and soft and it was super easy and effective when trimming my bikini area. I recommend this product to all women!</li>
    <li> The new TrimStyle is by far my favorite. I love the multiple settings feature so that you can choose how short to trim your bikini area. This razor really improves my leg and bikini area routine because everything I need is all in one tool. It makes things so much easier and takes no time at all to use. Out of the three settings, setting 2 is my favorite because it gets your bikini area not too short, it&#x27;s just right. I love my new TrimStyle razor.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this razor, its moisturizing,and gets the job done perfectly. You don&#x27;t need to waste your time going over your legs more than once like with other razors. The dual end with bikini trimmer is an AMAZING feature and perfect for summer. you can shave to your desired length and not have to worry about any ugly razor burn while wearing your bikini! Its versatile and you can use it on other parts of your body like your eyebrows or facial hair! its perfect size!  I&#x27;m so glad that i was able to test out this product for free curtesy of Bzzagent!</li>
    <li> Best razor ever!!  I received the Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle as part of a free promotion from BzzAgent.  Not getting paid for reviews, they send out products for consumers to try for free and give honest opinions.&lt;br /&gt;It came right at the beginning of spring, so I was excited to see what this could do on my first day of shorts-weather.  I was not disappointed!  The regular razor head has little bubbles at the top and bottom that are pre-loaded with shaving cream.  The razor itself cuts close to the skin, does not leave stubble, but I have yet to cut myself with this razor.  My skin was left feeling silky soft after using it, and continues to do so weeks later, shaving daily.  The ads say the moisture lasts up to 2 hours, but it&#x27;s been mostly day-long in my experience!&lt;br /&gt;The bikini part is also great, although I don&#x27;t use it very often.  The comb is adjustable, but it came in the perfect spot for me so I didn&#x27;t have to play around with the adjustments at all.  I typically use the Bic Soleil razors with shaving gel; I have never seen such amazing results with them.  The razor is a little pricier, but when you&#x27;re not switching out razors and having to purchase shave gel and moisturizing lotion afterward, I&#x27;d say it ends up being a better deal!</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro Silk- I actually have never had/owned such a nice razor. I have used this one pretty much the day I got it. I LOVE the fact that it comes with a trimmer- that is sooooo useful. I love that you can actually adjust the length of the hair you want to trim down. It is very handy that the trimmer is one with the razor- I really like that I can take the razor/trimmer into the shower and use one end or the other- depending on what I want to do. I love that I have two choices in one gadget! I enjoy the silky feel the razor leaves behind, and I actually did not use any kind of shaving cream with it. It did not seem necessary! I love my new razor very very much and I love that it comes with a trimmer. Perfect timing for summer-ready! Thank you SCHICK for sending me such an awesome product to try out for free!</li>
    <li> I love this both the bikini and the razor work so well. I love that this is two in one and I can replace the razor head. And can have a personalized  shave. The shave is smooth and lasts for a longer time then with some other razors. I would recommend this to anyone who uses a bikini and razors. I recieved this to try for free and I&#x27;m so glad I got to try it.</li>
    <li> I love that I can control the trim length and I can get a close shave without irritation! Also that I can use this anywhere not just in the shower. it&#x27;s very convenient. And I got it for free! Thanks to BzzAgent Jono And Schick!</li>
    <li> I received this for free from the Bzzagent campaign, and finally got around to testing it out. This is probably one of the best razors I have used. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be this good honestly. I like razors with a lot of product already on them (sometimes if I&#x27;m in a rush I just want to be able to quickly get it over with without also wasting time on putting shaving cream on) and when I opened this and saw it was mostly just blades I was kind of disappointed. After I used it though, I fell in love with it! Seriously, because there are so many blades and they are so close together, you get a really close shave, almost like you just waxed. There is still some product on the razor which does hydrate. The trimmer is also AMAZING! There are interchangeable covers on it which are meant for taller hair and for short hair. I highly recommend this razor especially for bikini season because it has become my lifesaver!</li>
    <li> My go-to shaver for my legs and pits is usually the Schick Intuition. I am a mom, so I multitask most of my life, especially when it comes to personal care. So I usually shower shave. The nice lathery bar around the Intuition makes it very soft and quick to use and usually leaves me feeling very smooth both because of the shave and the hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle&#x27;s leg shaver is about average in my opinion. For shaving in the shower, it&#x27;s just not as nourishing as I&#x27;m used to. It does contour well, but so does the Intuition I normally use, or at least the hydrating bar on it absorbs some of the impact. I ended up with a good shave and few if any minor nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The addition of the bikini trimmer is wonderful...this allows me to multitask more and it was a nice little trimmer. I was surprised at how powerful it was and though I had pre-trimmed a couple of weeks ago it did great without getting hung up or catching and pulling or causing any pain. I like that it was waterproof so I could use this in the shower to immediately wash away the hair. One part of this that I would like to see improved would be to make it easier to rinse out someway, and to somehow cover or put a lid on the leg shaver while using this so I wouldn&#x27;t be worrying about cutting my hand while using the trimmer end of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, though I may not use this very often for my regular shaves, I will definitely be using this little trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed this as a BzzAgent #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I got the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor free from BzzAgent and I&#x27;m seriously obsessed with it. Prior to using this razor, I used an Venus Olay moisturizing razor and didn&#x27;t realize my legs could actually be smoother. After getting and trying out the TrimStyle, I went back to CVS and returned the package of new razor cartridges from my Venus--honest! This thing keeps my legs smooth for over 2 days, which is just crazy to me, because with my old razor I never felt *truly* smooth in the way I do with this one. I had to shave every day with my old one! The razor itself is pretty chunky, but that&#x27;s mostly due to the built in bikini trimmer which is a great feature. It even comes with a battery!  The bikini trimmer is entirely water resistant and you can still store your razor in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I can find with this razor is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a hanging storage option like many other razors do.  This is probably because it is heavier than a traditional razor. You have to lay it on it&#x27;s side using a built-in kickstand, so be careful not to step on it. o_O</li>
    <li> This razor was much better than I expected!! The razor end was nice for my legs and underarms, while the &amp;#34;bikini trimmer&amp;#34; was perfect for trimming unwanted facial hair! I unfortunately grown hair on my neck and sideburns, and this worked much better than trying to pluck all the tiny hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to have received this razor FREE through a promotion from the brand!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t purchase this razor from Amazon, got a free &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; through bzzagent.com. This is hands down the best razor I&#x27;ve used in years! I love how soft it has left my skin and even the hair I have growing is softer than its every been. I&#x27;m amazed by this product and can&#x27;t wait to try it the bikini trimming side! I I&#x27;ll definitely be buying refills for the razor in the future!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this razor! Thanks to BzzzzAgent I was able to try it for free and my only obligation was to review it with my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;First I was super impressed that a battery was included for the trimmer. It always seems that you don&#x27;t think about the battery that your probably going to need for something like this until you get home and another trip to the store is needed. Now on to the actual razor. Its thicker and a bit heavier then your average razor but with that in mind it handled very well. The moisturizing strips were very cool. I haven&#x27;t needed shaving cream at all since I&#x27;ve started using this about a week ago. I will say the strips themselves ooze out quite a bit so I am not sure as to how long they would last. The razor itself is so smooth on your skin it doesn&#x27;t feel like your shaving at all. It leaves your legs and bikini line SMOOTH! Overall I am very impressed and love this razor!</li>
    <li> All in all, this is a pretty cool product. I was lucky enough to get it for free through schick and Bzzagent. Opinions are totally my own though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor end works well. It&#x27;s comparable to other shick razors. The moisture strip is great, I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks and it&#x27;s still working very well. It gives a close shave, though I&#x27;ve had better. But it leaves absolutely no irritation or dryness so it&#x27;s a good trade off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bikini trimmer end is pretty good too. I like that I can just trim up my bikini zone rather than shave all of the way down because it prevents that itchy irritated feeling that you get from shaving when the hair starts to grow back in. The only bad thing about it is that it&#x27;s not adjustable like the box says. Technically it is, but it only works well without the adjuster on it. But I didn&#x27;t want to use it anyway, so it was no big deal. It&#x27;s very high quality and seems like it will last a LONG TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy another one of these razors? Yep. For sure.</li>
    <li> This is literally the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, and I mean that completely honestly. I&#x27;ve tried so many different types and brands of razors in the past, but nothing compares to this one, which I was very pleasantly surprised by as I had received this as a free product sample to test. However, as it turns out, this razor is absolutely amazing and it is a product that I will definitely continue using for a long time, and one that I plan to purchase also. What I love most about this razor is the range of motion that the head of the razor has, which makes my shaving process so much easier and more comfortable. Second, I really like the moisturizing beads next to the razor blades, which help make the razor glide very smoothly along my skin, while also moisturizing it in the process. Third, the 5 razor blades are certainly a plus, as they make sure that all the hairs are removed. As for the bikini trimmer portion, I haven&#x27;t tried that yet as it&#x27;s still 40-50F where I live so it&#x27;ll be a quite a while before I need to shave that region, but from what I can tell the adjustable length comb seems like a great feature as I love product customizability, so I will definitely take advantage of that when I get around to using it. Overall, this razor went above and beyond my expectations and I am so glad that I was able to discover it through the free product sample given to me. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new, excellent razor to purchase!</li>
    <li> First I want to thank BzzAgent for sending me a free Hydro Silk to test! I used to think that all razors were the same, but now know better. I have been using a Venus razor since I was 14 and felt that it was pretty comparable to the Hydro Silk. I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of how big the handle was, but it makes sense since it holds a battery for the trimmer. The first time I shaved I got horrible razor burn, but figured that it was just because it was a fresh razor. I used it a few more times, but the last time I nicked myself horribly. This hasn&#x27;t happened since I started learning how to shave, and the nick was on the front of my shin, which is a nice, smooth surface. However, I didn&#x27;t just nick myself once, I now have a whole chain of cuts along my shin from this razor. Hence the Ouch! I then tried the trimmer, which I had high hopes for, but it didn&#x27;t do much and left red marks all over me. Maybe I just have sensitive skin, but this is not the razor for me. There is one perk though, the razor has a little built-in stand that allows you to prop it up without needing an additional container or leaving the razor blades resting on the shelf/tub.</li>
    <li> I got this Schick HYDRO Silk TrimStyle razor free from BzzAgent to test &amp; truthfully report my experience for other consumers. The razor is beautiful &amp; a very attractive turquoise – makes a beauty chore enjoyable. It has a comfortable handle too.  I think this is the best refillable razor I’ve ever used with a few caveats. The pluses:  5 blades provide an amazingly close, smooth shave &amp; are infused with a unique hypoallergenic moisture serum which is especially great for those with allergies or sensitivities. The head pivots &amp; swivels easily to hug every curve. It has a trimmer on the one end to handle those delicate bikini areas. One caution (not really minus once you are aware of this): The directions say to use shaving gel. I used shaving cream &amp; perhaps that was a mistake. Some of my hairs were missed because the built-in moisture serum coupled with the cream was too much. I’ll try going just with the serum next time. One minus: When using the trimmer, it would not stay ON unless I kept the button depressed which was very awkward. I experimented a bit &amp; found that if I slid the button forward towards the trimmer head, then it would stay on. But the 2nd use, I could not get it to stay on without keeping it depressed. If my finger went off the button, it stopped. The directions are WRONG on this issue as my razor trimmer won’t stay ON very easily. It was difficult to turn off as well. This issue needs improvement. One huge minus I must mention about this razor is the TV ad I have seen a few times involving bikini clad females &amp; trimming “bushes”. This ad is in very poor taste and will turn off many potential consumers. Advice to SCHICK: Please stop showing this ad and come up with a classy TV campaign truly worthy of great company &amp; a fine razor.</li>
    <li> Recieved a free product. Works great, close smooth shave, best razor by far! My favorite.</li>
    <li> Alright so I got this product yesterday thanks to BzzzzAgent. It was sent as a free product to try out and give my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it once so far but wanted to give my initial thoughts after my first go around. Should I change my mind in subsequent shaves, I&#x27;ll update accordingly.&lt;br /&gt; I have very sensitive skin and have always suffered from razor burn and in grown hairs especially in my bikini area. I have been using this product for about 1 month with the original blade (probably time to change it out now) and im thrilled at how smooth my skin is. No razor bumps or ingrown hairs at all, anywhere on my body! Highly suggest it ladies. Its worth the money! - nothing to say about this particular seller tho or Amazon, because like I said I bought it at my local CVS pharmacy. I have purchased from Amazon before and always been pleased.</li>
    <li> After using disposable razors for my legs and depilatory cream on bikini area for years, I recieved this razor from BzzAgent and was super excited to be able to try it! I used the razor in the shower without shaving cream and the shave was so close and left my legs feeling so soft, that even after two days there isn&#x27;t any stubble! I was even able to shave my knees and ankles without any problems, something that I have to be very careful with when using other razors. That said, I felt a little bit of a burning sensation immediately after shaving, but I have rather sensitive, dry skin, so that is probably the cause. As for the bikini trimmer, I had a little more difficulty getting it to work. You have to use the trimmer a very specific way for it to trim anything, but once you figure out the direction and pressure that works best, it trims relatively easily. The grip handle of the razor made it very easy to handle in the shower, though I did have some difficulty pressing the button on and off for the trimmer. You also have to be careful with how you hold the razor, because I found that when shaving my legs, I would accidently press the trimmer&#x27;s on-button which kind of startled me before I figured out what had happened. Overall, this razor left my legs looking and feeling great, and, after figuring it out, the trimmer left my bikini area soft and smooth as well!</li>
    <li> @schickhydrosilk LOVE it!!!!</li>
    <li> Alright guys lets take a moment to discuss this razor! If you are looking for sleek and sexy legs, then you need to drop your current razor and pick this beauty up. My legs have never been smoother, and I have sensitive legs that are prone to cuts, this razor not even once cut me. Lets move the conversation to the trimmer. We all know hoe difficult it can be to trim and shave down there. If you use the trimmer without the shield it is literally like cutting through warm butter, and using the razor to finish it off and make everything smooth. Ladie&#x27;s if you haven&#x27;t already added this razor to your cart you need to do so right now!</li>
    <li> I got a super close and very moisturizing shave with this razor. I didn&#x27;t even need to apply lotion to my legs after shaving because they already felt super moisturized, silky, and smooth. I love that the razor had 5 blades. I think this was the main reason I got such a close shave. The bikini trimmer works really great as well. I love the fact that you have the option to use it in or out of the shower. I have tried other razors in the past, but after trying this razor/bikini trimmer in one, I&#x27;ve found the perfect razor/trimmer. I recieved this product as part of a promotion from a brand.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydto Silk TrimStyle complimentary from Bzzagent during one of their campaigns. Usually shaving my bikini area takes 15-20 minutes to get the close shave I like. From start to finish this took me 8 minutes. I was hesitant to use the trimmer end of the razor. In the past I have used big bulky trimmers that are designed for my bikini zone. I was very impressed with the trimmer. It got extremely close to my skin and never once snagged my skin or had hair pulled out because of the shears like the bulky ones in the past have done. The handle made it very easy to menuever and was sleek making getting at awkward angles and crevices easier. The power button was easy to press on and I never accidently shut it off during my shave. The power button took 2 tries to turn it off almost every time I used it but wasn&#x27;t bothersome enough to deduct stars from its rating. After trimming it was easy to transition to the razor and finish. The razor gave a nice close shave that was very comfortable. Although the handle is larger for this part of the shave, its rubber design makes it easy to hold and not at all awkward. The blades themselves are high quality and glided over my skin with little resistance. The hydrating serum around the blades left my bikini line very smooth with no irritation as other razors have done to me in the past. This razor did not give me razor burn and the trimmer didn&#x27;t leave me looking like a plucked chicken like other shears have. I am 100% satified with this product and will be suggesting it to everyone. My husband even is jealous!</li>
    <li> This new Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® razor is great! So simple to use. I liked the shave that it provided. No unsightly bumps or rashes. I definitely feel like it provided moisturizing as well as a great close shave. Very impressed with this new great product. Thanks Schick. Summer ready with this great razor!</li>
    <li> Alright so I got this product thanks to BzzAgent. It was sent as a free product to try out and give my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always hated shaving because the razors that I use! None have ever seemed to work for me and I have always had razor bumps soon after shaving. Sexy, right? NOPE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has 5 blades and moisturizing strips along with a handy trimmer on the other end. Its a large razor but fits comfortable in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the razor part of this product several times since I received it in the mail 4 days ago and I can honestly say its the best razor I have ever used! I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same spot 15 times just to remove all the hair, it was one and done! My skin is very sensistive so this product has become a life saver for me, just in time for bikini season!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the trimmer part of this product one and have nothing but good things to say about it as well. I love that its adjustable! it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair and its very efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my favorite part of this product is that it&#x27;s water proof so that I don&#x27;t have to add an extra step of trimming before I get in the shower into my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product! I love being a Bzzagent and I loved trying this product for free!</li>
    <li> I really dig this razor! I&#x27;ve been using the Schick Quattro for Women for years now and really had no desire to change razors. After using the newest Schick Hydro with 5 blades, I am officially switching razors! This razor not only gave me an extremley close shave, but I could FEEL and SEE the amazing amounts of moisture it left behind as I shaved and it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my skin. I have extremely thick, coarse hair so really getting a close shave can sometimes be difficult, but this razor definitely did the trick. I constantly fight dry, itchy and sensitive skin and this razor didn&#x27;t cause me any grief. There was literally enough moisture from the strip that I think I could have actually used the razor with NO shaving cream. As a fan of Schick already, I would definitely recommend this. It also came with several coupons for replacement blades and shaving cream. Definitely worth the investment if you haven&#x27;t already tried it. I recieved this product as part of a promotion for the brand.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! My skin is very thin and sensitive. All the other brands that I have used have always gave me cuts and knicks, but this product hasn&#x27;t cut me at all. It keeps my skin smooth and silky.  There is no irritation at all. Plus, the bikini trimmer is great to get any hairs I missed. I love that is waterproof. I&#x27;m glad I got to try out this product from a promotion. This has changed what razors I buy now. Definitely Schick all the way for me!</li>
    <li> I was given this product free for testing purposes from buzz Agent. I love the versatility of the Schick Hyrdosilk Trim Styler. You can easily switch from shaving your legs to grooming more private areas. I like that it&#x27;s waterproof so you can touch up in the shower too. The button for the trimmer power is perfectly crafted. You have to press and hold for a few seconds before letting go, that way you don&#x27;t accidentally turn it on if you bump it. Genius! The only thing is that I wish the trimmer head was a little bigger. I&#x27;m a bigger gal so it&#x27;s a little harder to get in that down there area, but this trimmer did the job. It easily cuts off the hair and I didn&#x27;t have problems with it clogging up. I&#x27;m glad it had four length settings to avoid getting nicked or cut. The trimmer head comes off easily for cleaning and this is a lifesaver! I recommend cleaning it after every use it you want everything to keep running smoothly. The razor end works awesome as we all knew it would. I&#x27;m so happy I can attach my hydrosilk sensitive care blades to it as well. I would definitely recommend this to ladies who want to shave time off their grooming routine. Thanks again Schick for another great product!</li>
    <li> I jumped at the chance to try this product when I received the email from buzzagent to try it and review it.  I used the razor first and my legs are so soft and smooth. Until I got this trimmer I was afraid to even think about taking care of my bikini line, but this trimmer makes it so easy and comfortable. Now I am ready for swimsuit season!</li>
    <li> I know this is like an advanced Schick Hydro for woman but I think the packaging could be more unique.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the trimmer are amazing and great quality highly recommend the razor for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;I was not a fan of the razor I do not think it shaves great, you have to do many strokes and then touch up areas.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free to try from bzzagent. This razor is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had! It made my legs so silky and smooth! I love how the razor moisturized my skin while I shaved. The trimmer part was also wonderful and trimmed a lot of my hair. I would recommend this razor to anyone who wants silky smooth legs.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle free to try out and review and I have to say I have good thoughts and bad about this product. I definitely liked the razor for my legs, they were exceptionally smooth. However the razor did not get my underarms smooth at all I guess because its too big for that area. I liked the large handle it was easy to grip however the power button is kind of iffy, you have to really push it to get it to stay on. The trimmer end I wasn&#x27;t a fan of I used it without the comb on it because I prefer a smooth bikini area but it kept nicking me so they really should add to the directions that using the bare trimmer makes it much more likely to cut you. Next time I will try it with the comb on the shortest setting and see how I like it. I did end up just using the razor end to finish up my bikini area and was very pleased with those results.</li>
    <li> Ok guys.. I have to share, so I have a condition on my skin called keratosis pilaris so basically I produce extra keratin that blocks my hair ducts on my skin causing bumps and red looking dots that are under my skin. So when I do shave I have to use extra caution to make sure that I am moisturized to help prevent the additional keratin build up. Prior to using this new Hydro silk razor two in one from Schick I was using another once of Schick&#x27;s razors the &amp;#34;Intuition&amp;#34;, I used this razor because, it came with the conditioning block on the actual razor but, the razor itself did not do the best of jobs. When schick provided me with this new razor to try for #free I surly took this offer. This to date has been the best razor I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioning strip on the razor pairs perfectly with the schick shaving lotion that I purchased with the awesome coupon Schick provided me. My legs are not only smooth and conditioned but, they actually have a shine to them again. I am so happy and I can imagine it can only get better from here! This is for sure my new go to razor. I also was able to use the electric razor in the shower for my bikini area and WOW.. this cuts so low with no razor burn, no pain... it is amazing. This all in one tool is a GO TO for me.. #teamschick #lovemyrazor #schick #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I like this razor like I like any other razors I have used. The only difference is this one has a trimmer on the other end. My hair grows back very fast so my legs stay smooth for maybe a day. But having the trimmer on the other end that I can use in the shower is super convenient especially when your in a hurry. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> Whether you should get it or not? Here is my pros and cons list of this razor/trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it really waterproof? - Yes! Used and tested! as long as you don&#x27;t open the battery case in the middle of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;1. 2 in 1 product - only need to bring one product on vacation&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s waterproof - I can take it into the shower!&lt;br /&gt;3. It came with an AAA battery in the package. How Thoughtful.&lt;br /&gt;4. For the bikini trimmer part&lt;br /&gt;- it has 4 adjustable comb levels to choose from, 0 being the shortest and 3 being the longest. I have some options for how long I want to keep my hair.&lt;br /&gt;- does what it says and no pain!&lt;br /&gt;5. For the razor part&lt;br /&gt;- it has a support stand so when I lay it flat, the blades won&#x27;t touch the surface&lt;br /&gt;- the hypoallergenic moisturizing serum over the blades goes on to my skin smoothly, the gel consistence protects my skin from irritation while shaving. I didn&#x27;t get razor burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;1. I wish it had a cover for the razor head so that it&#x27;s more travel friendly.&lt;br /&gt;2. Maybe it can be a bit smaller/shorter? (also for travel purposes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that you need to know&lt;br /&gt;---- Make sure you press the on/off button firmly and release to turn the trimmer on. I used it before reading the instructions and ended up holding the button while trimming.. I will just say it wasn&#x27;t fun...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line&lt;br /&gt;If you are a shaving/trimming girl instead of a waxing girl - give this product a try!&lt;br /&gt;If you like the pain - good for you! you may go with waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure - I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> No more hair sticking out from panties or bikini lines yay!! This razor is wonderful and leaves my legs so smooth and touchable. I have no bad things to say!!!</li>
    <li> The razor is great! Super close shave, the hydrating part works well (although I didn&#x27;t think it lasted 2 hours), and the shave didn&#x27;t leave me with razor burn. The trimmer part left something to be desired. The power button was in an awkward location, the trimmer is small and takes a long time to use on any significant area, and the direction needed to clip the hair is very awkward. So I&#x27;d say save your money on the trimmer. But the brand and razors is still overall great.</li>
    <li> love this razor with the  5 bladea and trimmer r and strip, leaves  legs smoothe and bikini area as well, its a must for all women, i recieved this from bzz as a free sample and cant live without it now</li>
    <li> Thanks to Bzzagent and Schick for providing me this product to test. I have always used Schick and over the past couple years have used the pink trimmer 2-in-1. I was so excited to get to test this product because I loved the previous. This new product is amazing. It has a much closer shave. It&#x27;s been about a week since I&#x27;ve used it and my legs are in better shape than they have been with any other razor. The bonus is the trimmer with the razor. I get to make sure I&#x27;m bikini ready easily and without having another product. I also like the new design and color. The fact that it is also waterproof is a bonus. I highly recommend this razor if you want a great shave and trimmer in one product.</li>
    <li> I was able to try out for free the new schick hydro silk trimstyle razor &amp; bikini trimmer from bzzagent. I have used other schick hydro silk products and love the smooth shave this line offers. I love that the hydro silk trimstyle razor &amp; trimmer can work wet or dry. It makes a close shave, but still leaves your skin feeling smooth. I am prone to bumps from shaving and have not had this problem at all with this razor or trimmer! It is battery operated and includes a battery. The battery power for the trimmer makes it work to trim and does so efficiently. It also fits in your hand to be able to hold the razor easily for shaving, but it is a little wider handle than your average razor.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through BzzAgent for a free trial.  I was using the Schick Quattro that has the battery operated razor on the opposite end of the razor blades, basically the same set up as this one.  I loved that razor, hated the battery side though as it often pinched and grabbed, so I just used the one side only.  Getting the Hydro Silk Trimstyle Razor I expected the same performance as the Quattro, except this one has an optional detachable head part, so that&#x27;s a bonus upgrade.  I took deep breath and tried it and no pinching...I was so relieved lol.  I even popped off the attachment and tried the regular part without getting myself, so that was another plus.  This will NOT take you down to &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; status, it will trim you up though.  I suggest either using the opposite razor end or wax, something other than this end if you want to be hairless in your nether regions.&lt;br /&gt;Then the time came to try the razor side.  Into the shower I went and lathered up with shaving cream.  Glided like a dream and even performed better than my Quattro (which I had just replaced it&#x27;s razor head on shortly before trying this..in fact I had to wait a couple of days to try it because I had shaved the night before receiving this).  On my underarms area...no problem!  A few passes and they were gone.  I was pretty satisfied with my Quattro, but this one just topped that one as my favorite razor.  I have sensitive skin and have suffered razor burn from the Venus series and other razors (which is why I kept with getting refills for the Quattro)...I did not have any negative effects from using this razor.  I know some people have cited they had horrible razor burn, but I think it&#x27;s a case by case individual basis to be honest. The strip was a little slimy the 2nd time I used it, but it wasn&#x27;t an impeding factor for me.</li>
    <li> BATTERIES ARE INCLUDED- I loved seeing that a razor comes with the battery already included. Most razors that have great quality like this one require you to spend more money on a battery to allow it to even do it&#x27;s job! The Silk Trim Style Razor was FANTASTIC! It gave me such a close, clean and smooth shave! I loved the Bikini trimmer, and not having to switch to another razor. Yay for it benig water proof as well, and the weight and grip was perfect on this razor. It was so easy to handle and maneuver while using it. I think my husband even got a little jealous by this razor!</li>
    <li> This razor and trimmer is AMAZING!!!!!! I have always loved the Schick brand and I was very excited to help review this product through BzzAgent. Lets start with the packing. The packaging is sleek and easy to open. My first thought was that the Trim Style looks a bit bigger than expected. When you get out the Trim Style you will be pleasantly surprised. It seems big but fits so nicely into your hand. You always have the perfect  grip so no more nasty nicks! I first tested out the trimmer. I loved the fact that you can adjust the comb to the perfect setting.The Trim Style works well out of the shower but I prefer it in the shower since it is waterproof.  I got a smooth clean bikini line with no sharp hairs left behind. I can not say enough about the razor on the Trim Style! It is so sharp but glides on your skin so softly! The hydrating strip provides just the right amount of moisture! I get the closest shave I have ever had with the Schick Trim Style! You Need this 2 in 1 Schick Trim Style!  It is well worth the money! I am beach ready thanks to the Schick Hydro Silk Trim Style!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a promotion from Schick, I love this razor! Smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. The trimmer is an added bonus. Will definitely be using this from now on.</li>
    <li> I got this as a free item through bzzagent. I have used it multiple times since i have received it with great success. It leaves my legs feeling super smooth. It has many different settings which makes it nice. It also has a nice thicker handle to make it easier to hold in the shower. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have never used a razor that was for both legs and the swim suit area. This razor does a close shave and the ease of use is great as well. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to try something new and unique from other brands out there.&lt;br /&gt;I received this free for product review purposes. The handle is the right thickness as well .</li>
    <li> After reviewing this product for free from Bzzagent i was amazed! My initial thought when unboxing was woah...this is bulky, but after actually using the product-i was impressed! A very close shave along with trim!</li>
    <li> Wow!! I had always used my husbands razors because I couldn&#x27;t ever find a women&#x27;s razor that game me as close a shave as his, as well as not cause irritation to my sensitive skin. As soon as I received this razor that I received complimentary from BzzAgent and Schick for testing purposes, I used it! I was SO surprised and pleased! My legs have never felt smoother, and I think it is because of the moisturizing serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable, waterproof bikini trimmer is fantastic, it makes trimming so much easier and its faster! Usually, I have to shave every 2-3 days.. I&#x27;m going onto day 6 and I&#x27;m just starting to get some stubble. I&#x27;m definitely sticking to this razor in the future,</li>
    <li> This was my first time using Schick Hydro silk trimstyle since It got sent to me to try it out. and I have to say this is a good shaver.  My legs were smooth when I tired this.  It gives a clean close smooth shave that everyone would definitely enjoy. The timmer on the other hand didn&#x27;t really work for me.  Not my thing.  It did it&#x27;s job but would I regularly use it??...not really. However I will be using the coupon they sent me to continue buying their products.  #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a Freebie. I was expecting it to be just like all of the other razors i have tried, but i was sooo wrong! this is the best razor i have ever used!!! it gives the closest shave possible! and the trimmer is amazing for the bikini area, and if you prefer to shave that too the razor is PERFECT, no cuts, no nicks, just smooth soft perfect skin. i would recommend this to anyone 100X over. i would suggest that you keep i mind the razor itself is not electric. just the trimmer. also i recommend not leaving it in the shower and drying it off after each use for maximum life. but all in all this is an amazing product!! i haven&#x27;t had a problem with it yet. this will be my razor from now on for sure .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it fit a couple weeks now thanks to bzz agent, I love it! The moisturizer on the razor works great, I&#x27;m not getting razor burn or dry skin. The trimmer has 4 different settings so you can choose what&#x27;s right for you :-) I definitely recommend this trim style razor!!</li>
    <li> I do love this product the only thing I would have to say about the razor itself is that yes it gives a clean close shave. However anyone looking at this razor for a quick shave...please be cautious because this razor is extremely sharp causing my quick shave to become an all out murder scene. I do love this product  it is amazing . i just know now to take my time with it. Unlike other razors I have used prior to this one they have guards on the blades to help prevent injuring  yourself. I do recommend this product :) #bzzagent</li>
    <li> I just tried the Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle for the first time complimentary of bzzagent. Can I just say what a convienance it is to have both a trimmer and a razor combined. The shave was smooth and close . Just make sure to use something to soften the skin first, razor burn , ouchy!! Loved this product.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a free sample from Bzz Agent. I was planning on using it as a travel razor though it is quite oversized and heavy due to the built in trimmer. I love the razor and got a really great smooth shave without issue. The trimmer part I have no use for so I wish it was more simple and lightweight. My boyfriend did express liking the style for himself for travel so I&#x27;ll probably give it to him.</li>
    <li> Definitely not the best razor I&#x27;ve used but it had it&#x27;s positives. LOVE the handle. It&#x27;s a thicker bigger handle, not like most skinny razor handles. It was much easier to hold and I didn&#x27;t drop it once (I usually drop my razor at least 2 times in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;It was a very smooth cut, usually with new razors I always have a couple nicks the first use. None with this razor. However, didn&#x27;t feel like it cut as close as my regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;Really like the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof. Added bonus!&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used this razor, the head broke off and won&#x27;t go back on. Not a good sign at all. Will buy new razor heads and see if those work. If not, probably won&#x27;t replace it. Too expensive of a razor to replace it for that reason.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini Trimmer free from Bzzagent! I have been using this razor for about two weeks now. I love it! Love that it is two tools in one. That the trimmer is adjustable. I love that the razor gives a smooth close shave and leaves my legs feeling silky and smooth, without razor burn. The head of the razor bends so that I can get a cleaner, smoother shave without cutting myself.</li>
    <li> The thing that sets this razor apart from others is its trimmer. If you do not plan on using the trimmer, I would recommend just buying a normal refillable razor.</li>
    <li> For years, I&#x27;ve used regular razors on my bikini area and have hated how it was never even or smooth and I would always get bumps from the irritation. Probably because I had to go over the same area several times to get all the hair.  With this new Schick Hydro TrimStyle, I can use one side for my legs and the other for my bikini area. The bikini side works so well and gets it all without three or four passes. Makes for a smoother shave and less irritation. Love this razor!!!</li>
    <li> I received this the other day from Bzzagent. I received it free to give my opinion on it. I shaved my legs with it and it was great way better than my other razors I use. I think the built of the razor is sturdy and it has good grips on it. I think that maybe my hair was to short so the actual razor part did not work but overall good product and I just saw this on sale a walgreens so if I had to pay for it I would its worth the money.</li>
    <li> I got this product to try out from Bzz Agent. I instantly liked the idea of a trimmer and razor in one, and had only previously tried a manual trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the razor itself is only okay. I&#x27;ve gotten a smoother shave from Gillette razors. It did cut me on one occasion and I just find it to not be my favorite blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the trimmer is awesome! I like that battery is not wasted when you&#x27;re not actively using it and the results are perfectly even and easy to achieve. Well done, Shick. I would buy this just for that feature.</li>
    <li> I got this product in the mail for free from bzzagent and i will say it&#x27;s a pretty good shaver/trimmer. I would like it to get a closwer shave like the venus shaver but overall it was great. I would change shavers for this little guy anyday!</li>
    <li> I just received this product for free by becoming a bzzagent! So far I love it, I love the convince of having a razor and a trimmer all in one!</li>
    <li> I received this for free to test but all opinions are my own. Overall, I like the razor. I really like that it is a thicker handle, 5 blades for a close shave, the moisture strip is an added plus. I noticed when using the razor, I do not have to shave my legs every day. The razor left my legs smooth after shaving. The trimmer is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. I removed the plastic outer piece and think it would work good if someone has longer hair. It is great that it the trimmer part is waterproof to save time! Overall this is a good razor and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> So I had no idea this duo existed until I was given the chance to try it free from BzzAgent and give my honest opinion. I always have the worst luck when it comes to razors so I gave up and just started buying the cheapo ones. I tried this one and I am so very pleased!! I love how it leaves my legs feel silky smooth. No problems at all with the bikini trimmer other than it doesn&#x27;t work too well with very little hair. I have found my match!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to be able to try the Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® razor thanks to a BzzAgent campaign I was a part of. When I first got the box, I was very excited. I loved the aqua blue and pearl white color of the handle, and was excited to see that the razor head had 5 blades! I am used to 3 with my current razor, so I was very excited to see how smooth of a shave I could get with 5. It also has a trimmer on the handle , which is battery powered. To my excitement, the battery was included! No searching around my house to find a rogue remote to pull the battery out of when I need to shave/trim.&lt;br /&gt;The box seemed a little big, and upon taking the razor out of the package and installing the battery (which can be done so easily, just a twist of the bottom), it did seem a bit heavy. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the blades were paired with a moisturizing strip. The box claims the blades are “Curve Sensing,” I’m not sure what that means, but I will say that I did not nick myself once while shaving, even over my knees, my ankles, and the dreaded back of the knee. The trimmer was a breeze, and it cut to the perfect length, not too long, but not to short and itchy either.&lt;br /&gt;After getting out of the shower, I moisturized my legs, and got ready for a night out. My legs felt so smooth and silky in my short dress that my husband couldn’t stop touching them all night! I was also pleased to notice that I had no stubble even 3 days later – this really gives a close shave! Since my first time using the Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® razor, I have used the same blade 3 times, and it does not seem to need to be changed yet. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got the Schick Hydrosilk TrimStyle razor &amp; trimmer to test for free from BzzAgent. I tried it right away (who wouldn&#x27;t?!) I love the trimmer, it has multiple settings and can be used with or without water. It&#x27;s perfect to a quick trim whenever you need it. The whole thing is waterproof, so you can use it in the shower, which is awesome! The conditioning strip on the razor end leaves your skin feeling soft, silky &amp; smooth. My only small complaint is that the blades do seem to dull a bit quickly, but honestly with the handy little trimmer at the other end, I would still definitely recommend this razor/trimmer!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my new freebie from bzzagent. This is a much appreciated tool and it was much needed. I am happy with the feel, versatility and smoothness it leaves. The possibilities are endless!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free as part of a BzzAgent Campaign. The handle of this razor is bulky and a bit heavy, which I actually found that I like a lot. The razor is a 5-blade razor with a moisture strip surrounding the blades. It shaves well, without snagging hair. However, I found that it became dull faster than other razors I use. I was both excited and nervous to use the trimmer, until I actually did. Trimming is NOT comparable to shaving, as I found out. There was no way I could use the trimmer with satisfactory results, even without the adjustable head on it. Plus, it hurt and it was a bit scary. Overall, it&#x27;s just OKAY. Not anything I&#x27;d want to spend money on.</li>
    <li> i recently got the SchickHydroSilk TrimStyle® and i absolutely love it. I was skeptical to try it at first but it gives me such a clean shave and leaves me feeling smooth for days. It is a 2-in-1 razor/trimmer that has adjustable trim length settings for a shave you like. Its so easy to use and clean and definitely makes me more motivated to shave more often. I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it!! #BeachReady #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I got this product through the BzzAgent site and is by far my favorite razor ever. I have been using it every other day for a month now and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet! Still super sharp and has the moisturizing strip going strong. I love the trimmer attachment it is so convenient and makes my time spent in the shower much shorter! So far no complaints!</li>
    <li> This right here folks is what you need. If you have issues being mistaken as a Bigfoot look no further. This is the product for YOU. Now I do testing for products so you must understand I have seen alot of razors but nothing this fancy. Dollar shave club might save you money and Venus might buy you time but Schick is the high quality most of us ladies require for us to stay committed, am I right ladies? but let me digress if you are someone considering this here contraption considering no longer go ahead and click add to cart or go on down to your local store that carries there bad boys!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this! It feels like it&#x27;s just gliding across your skin and leaves you completely smooth. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a promotion from the brand and it is seriously the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used! i will never go back to a regular razor. the bikini trimmer works amazing and the shave lasted so long! i love that its water proof so i can use in the shower. highly recommend</li>
    <li> So I recieved the opportunity to try out this product for free thanks to bzzagent and Schick.  Now I have used schick disposables before but never the TrimStyle. I normally hate shaving because of razor burns and the hair  grows back so fast and who has the time to shave multiple times a week?&lt;br /&gt; The first time I used it, I instantly  fell in love with the trimmer part of it. I love how it adjusts to different  lengths. Or you can just remove the guard altogether  and go as low as you&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the razor goes, I love how soft my skin feels after the moisturizing  strip surrounding it, and the razor did leave my skin smooth as well, but I felt I had to go over one too many times to achieve  that.  It could js be because my hair is dark and coarse  but idk.  I&#x27;ll try it again here in a couple of days and update you guys.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely still recommend  it esp to those that doesn&#x27;t have maybe as thick or coarse hairs  as I.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from BzzAgent, to review and give my honest opinion on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying, I have used many different razors in my short 11 years of shaving. I usually buy whatever Sam&#x27;s club has available because it&#x27;s so much cheaper to pay $16 for an entire years worth of razors than it is to pay $15 for 3 cartridges. However, that mindset is about to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is seriously the best razor I have ever used. I have very sensitive skin, so my shaving routine isn&#x27;t super simple. Normally it goes like this: 1) Use The Body Shop body scrub to remove any dead skin. 2) Apply EOS shave cream for sensitive skin. 3) Shave legs. 4) Apply Soap and Glory body butter. And even sometimes before bed I would have to apply Aveeno for itchiness. Now, I just shave, and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used razors with &amp;#34;moisture strips&amp;#34; before, and all they did was get my bathtub all slimy and slippery, or fall apart after 2 uses. With the TrimStyle, I can just shave with no worries. I&#x27;m not sure what kind of sorcery went into making the magical stuff that comes out of this razor, but it deserves some type of medal. When I step out of the shower, my legs are smooth and I feel as if I just applied lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the trimmer, well it&#x27;s just as great. I usually keep my bikini area pretty hair free but sometimes, it&#x27;s hard to get into the curves of your bikini area with a razor. With the TrimStyle, I can trim it down as close to my skin as the trimmer will allow (which is pretty darn close) and then the razor takes care of the rest of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be &amp;#34;donating&amp;#34; all of my cartridges and shaving creams to friends and family because I have found the only razor I&#x27;ll ever need!</li>
    <li> I love this razor! Being a sensative skinned gal i normally have trouble finding a razor that does not give me some sort of rash. However this razor hit the mark! The built in moisturizing strips allowed the blades to glide so smoothly and helped the blades not catch and cause nicks. However i was still worried that I would develop those dreaded &#x27;razor bumps&#x27;. But to my surprize the next day there was no rash! This razor left my legs feeling so smooth! Thanks bzzagent&lt;br /&gt; I would highly recommend this razor to anyone who wants a close smooth shave, especially someone that has sensative skin!</li>
    <li> First off, I got this for FREE through BzzAgent so I didn&#x27;t actually spend money on it.  Here&#x27;s my opinion after using it for a month:&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it, I missed a lot of hair on my legs, the goo that the moisture strips released were so much that I had stubble and just ended up using an electric shaver after my shower.  After a few uses the moisture strip was pretty much like that of a cheap disposable razor and I ended up with razor burn.  I hate using shaving cream/gel since I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of the chemicals usually found in them and have come to realize that after the moisture strip is done overproducing goo after the first two uses, shave gel/cream is a must.  (That&#x27;s why its not 5 stars)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is pretty decent.  First use, I felt that it was not very good though, I couldn&#x27;t get an even trim so I ended up with going over it again with my electric shaver&#x27;s trimmer attachment.  The next use was much better and even.  I must admit that I rather enjoy using the trimmer due to the size and width.  It allows for a more precise trim in specific areas as opposed to my larger/bulky shaver previously mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the asthetics and design...I feel there are flaws that shouldn&#x27;t have been overlooked.  For one, while using the trimmer, my fingers slipped slightly and the blades sliced my pinky nail and ring finger finger tip, it was slight but enough to make me wonder why the company didn&#x27;t provide a cover for the razor.  (That&#x27;s why its not 4 stars.  Also, keep in mind my hands were wet and soapy so that may have affected the rubber grip on the handle.)  After that, I started removing the razor head when I needed to use the trimmer.  Two: while using the razor, I noticed that I would every now and then slightly tap the power button and cause the trimmer to go off, the vibration of it would then cause me to nick my skin which is never fun.&lt;br /&gt;However, I did feel that the shape, feel, and weight of the handle was good; not too heavy, not too light, not too thin, and not too thick.  Just right for my hands to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I give this razor/trimmer combo 3 stars.  I liked it enough to keep using it for a month but not enough to say I would totally buy it for $30.  Moisture strips don&#x27;t last and blade replacements at roughly $5 a piece, I&#x27;m heading straight back to the Dollar Shave Club blades my husband and I get monthly ;)  With that said, I will continue to use the trimmer side.  I feel that I get a good trim and its size is quite convenient.  I will try to update on the trimmer after the first battery change.heavy, not too light, not too thin, and not too thick.

    <li> Lets start by saying I got this product  thanks to BzzzzAgent. It was sent as a free product to try out and give my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it quite a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So off the back I was surprised by the sheer size of this product. Loved the package it came in. Very eye catching. With the blues and purples, it definitelywas ment for the female eye. My daughter even said it was pretty. Upon opening the package I was once again surprised by the hefty weight that it had. It was certainly fancier than any razor I had ever bought. It looked like it  was there to get the job done with both end presenting cutting options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the good part. As soon as I did the first glide I understood entirely why they called it Hyrdo Silk. It glided on so smoothly and lightly, I had to wonder if it even touched my skin. It was almost like painting smooth strokes. After three strokes I gave up relying on my sense of feeling and relied on good old eyesight. I am a little ashamed to say how much hair it did pull off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did both legs and the whole time I was left to wonder if it was really shaving my legs at all. I had to go back a couple times with the back of my hand to make sure it did. I was left suprised with how soft it left it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wide girth and needy weight made it very easy to grip this. Usually I buy the second cheapest razors out there so this was damn near heaven in comparison. Since the handle is a rubber base it makes gripping it all very easy. With my old ones, I would have to tighten my grip if water touched my hand or even worse, soap where to coat the handle. .The bikini trimmer was something I never really used before. This one has three setting. I have only tried the first setting for now. If I take the plung and use the other two shorter settings I will be sure to update. It was very easy to use and did it job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked off one razor because of the price. I know that I got it free but I do not see myself paying this price for a razor maybe 20 as long as the blades didn&#x27;t cost the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend? In a heartbeat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will it rust? It actually gives you instructions on how to lay it down so that it will not rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I enjoy it? I never thought that I would actually like to shave.ee myself paying this price for a razor maybe 20 as long as the blades didn&#x27;t cost the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend?

I never thought that I would actually like to shave.</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary from BzzAgent for review, but all opinions are my own. I&#x27;m really glad I got it - it just works so well! It gives such a close shave so effortlessly, and the bikini trimmer portion is awesome. 100% waterproof, so it&#x27;s shower-friendly, which was a HUGE concern of mine with this product, because I only shave in the shower. It&#x27;s also really sturdy - I&#x27;ve dropped it a couple times, but it still works perfectly fine. (I don&#x27;t think one should do so purposefully, though - I&#x27;m just clumsy.) I don&#x27;t really use shaving cream, so the moisturizing serum was really great to have on the razor side also. I am very pleased with this and will repurchase when I need to!</li>
    <li> Got it from BzzAgent, and it is my new favorite razor, It gives a great smooth shave and because of the weight of the battery and bonus trimmer part on the other end, it has a nice substantial feel in your hands, which I feel it makes it easier to control. The 5 blades and moisturizing strip give you a nice smooth shave every time.</li>
    <li> I will start this out with saying that I have always had issues with shaving.  It always comes with a ton of irritation and pain in the days following.  I&#x27;ve tried different razors, methods, creams, gels, after shaving creams, etc.  Ingrown hairs, *painful* red bumps, and general irritation.  So in general, I don&#x27;t shave unless I need to.  My beauty and attractiveness isn&#x27;t determined by the lack of hair on my body anyway, so I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to it not being a part of my &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34; in the last several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing that this razor was touted to reduce irritation, especially for the &amp;#34;bikini area&amp;#34; I got excited when I was selected to test and review this item for free from BzzAgent.  I do like to be silky smooth at times and it would be nice to experience it without it hurting me.  Okay.  So I take it out of the package and start inspecting.  A bit heavier than normal because it needs a battery for the trimmer part and the blades themselves were surrounded y moisturizing strips.  I started getting really excited then.  Maybe this wouldn&#x27;t be so bad.  I had some new pretties to model, so I decided to go all out and give my husband a treat.  The trimmer worked great- I used the 3 setting to start out with and then adjusted to the 2.  In the shower, things went smoothly- legs ended up giving me no problems and I even had a good experience shaving my vulva (yes, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called) compared to other razors in that area.  But the true test wouldn&#x27;t be until the next day.  That evening was good.  I went to bed happy and loved the feeling of the sheets gliding over my smooth legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day started off well.  By the time afternoon has peaked, I was feeling uncomfortable.  My legs were okay (just the usual ingrown hairs that have scarred my legs over the years), but the other....  By that evening I was in pain.  And I stayed in pain for the next week.  This is normal for me.  I know this.  I would love to find a product that wouldn&#x27;t induce this experience for me, but this is not it unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that for women who don&#x27;t have the problems I do that this razor was AMAZING.  It shaved well, nice and close to the skin, the moisturizing strips worked well, and the trimmer was helpful.  From now on I&#x27;ll be using this just on my legs (when I want to deal with the hassle) and the trimmer for my nether regions.  It&#x27;s a good razor, with a lot of good additions, so I gave it a 4/5.  It&#x27;s not the company&#x27;s fault that my body hates me.  ;)ouldn&#x27;t induce this experience for me, but this is not it unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that for women who don&#x27;t have the problems I do that this razor was AMAZING.

    <li> I received this from BzzAgent, and I was excited about the trimmer. I didn&#x27;t expect anything amazing from the razor, as I already use the men&#x27;s 5 blade from Schick, and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I didn&#x27;t imagine that downgrading my blade count would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It became pretty clear that the trimmer was not going to serve any purpose for me and my \\&quot;hairstyle\\&quot; within minutes. I can imagine if you have a design, or like to keep a little forest at a specific length, this is a godsend. But as a no frills, just straight shaving girl, it was just like a razor that did a worse job than a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This coupled with the fact that having both products in one just makes the grip awkward and clunky, makes me just not want to use it at all. The button is kind of poorly designed also, easy to turn on or off by accident. The extra padding and just general largess of the device makes it more difficult to get a close shave on your legs. Not to mention it isn&#x27;t even the best design of razor that they manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with my no nonsense razor. It just does a better job.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before and definitely didn&#x27;t like it because it honestly didn&#x27;t shave me at all so of course I brushed it off. However, I accepted a campaign because I love giving things a try before knocking them. I normally shave every 2 days because I am a bit on the hairy side and my husband loves to see me look like a doll. I shaved 2 days ago today and still no hairs growing out which is totally a miracle. I love how smooth is shaves and the way my skin feels after the shaving. I am not a fan of the barbers trimmer, but I did try it and it works pretty well, I have no complaints on it. I still don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m gonna be using that side. Over all I absolutely love this product and for what it does for me, it is totally worth the prize.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love his product. It gave me a close shave and the trimmer is convenient and works very well. I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have anything too great to say about this. The razor worked fine, but the bikini trimmer aspect didn&#x27;t. The product itself is bulky and it does take batteries (comes with one originally, but you&#x27;d obviously have to replace). I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase since a standard razor does the job! I got to try this for free through BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I just recently received the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle as a free product from BzzAgent. So far, my experience with this product has been very good. The 5-blade razor has left my legs feeling impossibly smooth - just in time for summer! The razor itself is easy to grip and it gently follows the curves of my skin. I haven&#x27;t experienced any nicks or cuts so far, which is a huge plus! As for the trimmer side of the TrimStyle, it took me a little bit to figure out how to use it. I&#x27;d never used a trimmer before, and honestly I was nervous about using something electric so close to my sensitive bikini area. Although trimming didn&#x27;t hurt or pierce my skin, I didn&#x27;t find much use out of it. Despite this, I think the razor side is exceptional.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I don&#x27;t have to worry about razor burn or getting any unwanted cuts! The gel cushion around the razor blades makes my skin moisturized after I use it!</li>
    <li> I can not say enough great things about the Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle razor. No longer are the days where I have to borrow my husbands trimmer and try to figure out how to work it, while not getting it wet! Now I can use my own Trimstyle! I love to use the shortest setting (there are 3 settings, short, medium, and long) on the trimmer. It is easy to use, the instructions are easy to understand, and the razor works great as well. To turn on the trimmer you just push one button on the razor. It is as easy as that. The razor leaves my legs feeling smooth, and the blade does not dull quickly like with some other razors. The blades are replaceable, and the razor/trimmer is waterproof so it is great to use in the shower or tub.</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent and Schick I was able to try this product for free! This Razor is definitely not a replacement for waxing, but perfect for those that are afraid or uncomfortable with using a blade or wax down there and I’m one of those individuals. I enjoyed the fact that the blade was waterproof and there was nothing that needed to be detached while I was in the shower. One of the best highlights about this items is that you have the ability to shave almost every part of your body in the Shower ;-) !! The trimmer does a decent trimming job, it’s not spectacular but it’s acceptable. I also appreciate that the company decided to include the battery with the product since most other companies would make you purchase your own. Plus it would suck that when you’re ready to use this cool new product you’d have to locate or purchase batteries first. The Schick trimmer’s handle is very comfortable and easy to hold while trimming and the razor’s end is pretty nice as well. However, while I LOVE the moisture provided on the razors end I wish that the razor did a better job at removing hair. My legs only had small stubble but I found that I had to continually go over different areas. Other than that, I would still purchase this product but I don’t think it would be a major staple in my house.</li>
    <li> No complaints here! I received it as a freebie from bzzagent and I love it!! It makes my legs smooth, no razor bumps! I have sensitive skin and shaving has always been an issue, it&#x27;s very rare that I find a razor I actually like but this is it! The trimmer is amazing too.... it&#x27;s adjustable so it suits the individuals needs. Good job Schick!</li>
    <li> Product arrived as described!  😃</li>
    <li> I received a free sample to test and share my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be too much information, but hey...I like to share! Lol. This is pretty cool. It makes shaving quicker because you can trim down the hair with one side, then clean shave with the other. I prefer the &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; look and it&#x27;s too bad the hair on my head doesn&#x27;t grow as fast as the hair down below. When too much time passes, shaving can take a while, this tool makes the work faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: this is available much cheaper in stores.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this razor! I received this razor from Bzzagent as part of a promotion to test and review. Most razors I use don&#x27;t give me a close enough shave unless I wait a week or so before shaving again. Regardless of when I use this razor, I always have baby smooth skin. This razor made a major difference in my shaving experience for the better. I don&#x27;t use the trim side due to my shaving preferences though, but I bought one for my sister and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I got this for free from buzzagent. I was excited about using it as soon as I took it out the box. I love how close of shave it gets. It adds a day to time of needing to shave again. Having a razor attached comes in handy so much. The fact that I can do all of this in the shower because it&#x27;s waterproof is awesome</li>
    <li> Treat your legs and bikini line to the 2-in-1 power of the Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® razor and waterproof bikini trimmer.I tried it for free through BzzAgent and loved it!  Clean shave and easy to grip handle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I received it free from BzzAgent.com, and I really do love it.  I&#x27;ve reviewed a few different razors, and this one is definitely the most versatile!  The trim feature gets close enough without making me nervous, and the blade shaves legs just like you would expect from a brand name like Schick.  If you want to keep just 1 razor around, make it this one!  No more separate electric razor/trimmer for me.</li>
    <li> I received the TrimStyle Razor and Bikini free to try from BzzAgent and I just LOVED this product! I never purchased anything other than disposable cheap razors before, and this is definitely worth paying more for. I like the 2nd shortest trim length and I am enjoying the fact that I am not having razor burn while shaving my legs anymore, which I used to have with the cheap disposable razors. My legs feel smooth and moisturized and I can get shaving done quickly without worrying about cutting myself or missing spots, cause it slides easily and doesn&#x27;t irritate or hurt your skin. Something worth knowing before you buy this razor is that it is not rechargeable, you need the thin batteries for it!</li>
    <li> Ok so I got to try this Schick TrimStyle bikini trimming razor through a website called Bzz Agent. It was sent to completely free, shipping and all. I tried for the first time a few weeks ago and oh my goodness is it cool! I am so thrilled with this product. It has made &amp;#34;keep up&amp;#34; so much easier. Besides Schicks already awesome razor, the TrimStyle has an electric trimmer on the other end that can be used in the shower. It comes with the battery needed to operate. The best part is it has an adjustable guard that helps you customize your trim length. I know it sounds weird &amp;#34;a customized trim&amp;#34; but it really is handy, and it comes off making cleaning it so so easy. It even looks cool with its bright blue handle. Like I said the website sent it to me completely free. I&#x27;d always heard about Bzz Agent but always thought they weren&#x27;t a legit company but they are. A friend of mine told me about them so I tried it for myself. I was super surprised to find out that they never even asked for credit or debit card information. They are awesome! They even sent me coupons for me to give to friends to try the razor as well as coupons for refill cartridges and other Schick products. Try it for yourself you won&#x27;t me disappointed.</li>
    <li> I must admit I was a little intimidated by this razor before I opened it. But i must say I&#x27;m in love with it. This is by the far the smoothest &amp; most gentle shave ever!! Literally feels like silk shaving my legs. Other razors you can feel it pulling the hairs out, not this one! The handle is nice and thick and very easy to hold. Doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hands due to the rubber gripping. The bikini trimmer part is convenient too. Although I could live without that part.. Overall I would definitely recommend this razor and I will only be using this from now on!</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product for free, and I&#x27;m so glad! This razor is amazing and I love that it has the bikini trimmer built in. I have been using it for a few weeks now and have purchased new cartridges for it, but I went with the regular ones instead of the sensitive skin ones. For some reason my skin gets more irritated by the sensitive ones. But I will continue to use this shaver and the razors. It gives me super smooth moisturizer skin that lasts longer!</li>
    <li> I received this through BzzAgent for testing purposes. It came with coupons to give out as well which was awesome! My legs have never been smoother, I use this razor just about every few day since I got it. It isn&#x27;t dull, it still works incredible. Typically I use a razor a few times and throw it out, this razor is such an exception! It is incredible. I told a coworker about it and she went right out and bought one (with the coupon I gave her.) The razor has a moisturizing strip, you do not have to use shaving cream, which is a huge bonus when you are in a rush! Although, I left it in my shower and it did get a little slimy due to the moisturizing strip, but I just wiped it off &amp; it was all set. I just love this razor, is so convenient and gives super close shave. You definitely want to try this razor, it is 100% worth the price.</li>
    <li> This razor does what no other bikini trimmer can, it can give you a close, clean shave with its 5 blades annddd it can trim to your desired length with its waterproof battery operated trimmer. No more worrying about strays or razor burn, this razor is awesome!</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotion from Schick and this razor is awesome. Makes your shower time less because it makes trimming so much easier with this product. Who doesn&#x27;t want to cut back on time in the shower/bath. And also what happens when you get invited to a pool party last minute, well guess what you can use this trimmer out of the shower too!!</li>
    <li> Seriously the best razor I EVER used! I received this for free as a promotion to try and review the product! Ok so I have to say, at first I was skeptical to use this. I have used men&#x27;s razors for as long as I can remember because I felt I got a better shave with it. Well after giving the Hydro Silk TrimStyle a try, boy was I wrong! It was a little awkward to use at first because of it&#x27;s size but it didn&#x27;t take long to get the hang of at all and I got a super close shave! I seriously fell in love with this and not sure if I will ever go back to my old men&#x27;s razor now!</li>
    <li> I got this product from bzzagent and i have to say i absolutely love it. It goves such a close shave and leaves my legs feeling silky, i also love the fact that it has a built in trimmer.#gotitfree</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this razor/trimmer! I am SO lucky that I was given this FREE as a Buzz Agent. I love the smooth shave of the razor and the silky feel, thanks to the moisturizing strip. But, my favorite part of the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle is the trimmer! With the adjustable comb it gives me a great, even trim. I love that it&#x27;s waterproof, and easy to use. The packaging was a bit of a pain, but the product is great! #gotitfree #buzzagent</li>
    <li> Overall the razor works good. I like that it is waterproof so that I can shave while in the shower. The razor leaves my legs feeling silky smooth. The bikini trimmer is only okay. I&#x27;ve used better. Overall, it is a good product that I would recommend to people. Thanks Bzzagent for sending it to me for free!</li>
    <li> I just received this razor from bzzagent and decided to give it a try. I normally use Gillette Venus razors and cartridges. I thought it would be cool too because of the trimmer side. The razor was easy to get out of the box. When I used the razor end, the gel was nice and I did not have razor burn. My legs felt soft afterwards. I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to use the trimmer yet but I will figure out how to use it eventually. Four stars because there wasn&#x27;t any directions with it that showed how to use the trimmer. This was a very nice razor and it gives me somewhat of the same results as using the venus swirl razor in the end.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. Both the bikini and razor ends work really well. You don&#x27;t have to replace the bikini trimmer just the razor blades. I heard about this product because of a Bzz agent campaign and it&#x27;s really cool. I think that especially since it&#x27;s summer it&#x27;s  important to feel confident and not having to worry about unwanted hair is really important.</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing.  Got this free from bzz agent best free site!</li>
    <li> Its a very good razor. The moisture stick wears off quickly and the razor doesnt last as long as another one i have but the trimmer makes up for that!! I love being able to have different settings and make my area super nice for swimsuit season!!!! Loving bzzagent for allowing me to try this</li>
    <li> I was lucky to receive a sample of the Schick Hyrdo Silk TrimStyle Razor from BzzAgent. I really do love this razor for many reasons.  First its awesome that you get both a razor and trimmer in one.  Basically it can be used for all your grooming needs.  The shape and size is perfect for easily gripping and controlling it in the shower.  It gets a very close shave and is still gentle on my skin which is very sensitive.  My legs were left feeling moisturized and smooth.  This is perfect for the upcoming swimsuit season.  I would definitely recommend and this is what I will be using from now on.</li>
    <li> I received this razor to try out for free and I must say I love it! I have been using it a couple of weeks now and everytime it has always left my legs silky and smooth. Not only are you getting a close shave you are also moisturizing at the same time. The whole razor itself is easy to grab and it will not slip out of your hands. The trimmer is adjustable which is another plus. I have tried other razors and they never really give you that close shave feeling like this one. I have definitely thrown out my other razor and even more so recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I got this razor from BzzzAgent for free to try out and give my opinion. I love this razor. It glides soo smooth and gentle on my skin. My shaving time has been cut in half because it gets so close I don&#x27;t have to go over again. No more dry itchy skin after shaving. Definitely recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I got the product free to review and I love it. Usually women razors dont work well on me but schick hydro silk impressed me. I also love that it has to sides one for trimming and the other one for shaving. My legs were really soft and no cuts after using it :)</li>
    <li> I received this razor/trimmer from BzzAgent, and I&#x27;m very happy with it overall. The trimmer works great and there is no need to keep going over the same area - this gets the job done right on the first try! The razor is good, very close shave that leaves your skin moisturized, however - mine didn&#x27;t have a guard on it. I have to be really careful not to get too close to it. I&#x27;m hoping that the refills have guards, so I can relax a bit when I hold it. Other that that, I think this is a great product that&#x27;s quite convenient!</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to try this product for free and I&#x27;m glad I was introduced to it.  It is a cool concept being s razor with waterproof bikini trimmer.  I didn&#x27;t think I was missing anything with my regular razor, just being a razor.  But, all aspects of this product work well adj it&#x27;s not overly expensive so overall it&#x27;s worth it in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used. Its great for the legs and the bikini area. It&#x27;s gives a nice close shave without irritating my skin at all. I love that you can change the settings depending on how close of a shave you want. I don&#x27;t need shaving cream on the actual razor side because of the moisture serum strips around the blades. This is my absolute favor razor to use, I even have the older model of this razor that came out a couples years ago and that one I thought was the best thing in the world until I received this one from Bzzagent to try out and I love it!!! Ever since I tried it out I have been telling my friends and family all about and having them go out at try it and they all feel the same way that I do!&lt;br /&gt;I love the look and feel of this razor in my hand, its very comfortable to use and not awkward or bulky to hold. The look of this raxor is very eye catching in my opinion, I love the color very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was given to me by Bzzagent to try out and give my honest opinion on.</li>
    <li> I consider myself to be a very average female with very basic needs.  I’ve never once used a tool as innovative as the Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle®, and to be quite honest I’ve never tried a trimmer in my life so I had to read up on them to even know how to use it.  I’m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one end, you have your Schick Hydro Silk replaceable razor head which is capable of giving a fabulously smooth shave with or without shaving cream.  I chose to shave one leg with the cream and one without – both methods proved successful but in the end I preferred the leg I didn’t use shaving cream on!  I was able to achieve smooth legs without going over the same areas several times (which I had to on the shave cream leg) and my leg was not left feeling like wet plastic or dried out.  Both legs were able to avoid any knicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other end of the Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® is a trimmer intended for your bikini area, which as I mentioned, I had to read up on how to use.  I found that I needed to completely remove the white guide because I keep my hair short enough that it wasn’t reaching with the guide on.  Once I took it off and found out the proper angle to use the trimmer at, it worked wonderfully.  While it doesn’t result in a smooth shave (a given) it does trim short enough for comfort and allows you to skip the itchy stage that follows shaving with a normal razor.  I felt no tugging or cutting, and despite my inexperience in trimmers, I’d consider the final result a success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A notable feature this shaver also includes is a nice little stand that keeps your razor head lifted off of any surfaces.  I found this pretty convenient as I’m always triple checking how I left my razor sitting on the shelf to avoid having the moisture strips dry to anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, using this tool was very easy, even as a new learner.  Battery insertion was flawless.  It does look bulky at first glance because we’re all used to seeing our sleek little razors, but it doesn’t feel overwhelming in your hand while you use it and I didn’t find it awkward at all to use one end knowing the other one was just waving around.  I&#x27;m very grateful to BzzAgent for allowing me a chance to try this product for free!seeing our sleek little razors, but it doesn’t feel overwhelming in your hand while you use it and I didn’t find it awkward at all to use one end knowing the other one was just waving around.  I&#x27;m very grateful to BzzAgent for allowing me a chance to try this product for free!</li>
    <li> YASS! BzzAgent sent me this razor to try and I love it! The battery operated trimmer is just awesome! :D It left my legs soft and smooth and TOTALLY ready for summer! Bring on the heat! :D I am so beyond excited.</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotional item through BzzAgent.  I enjoyed this new Schick Razor, although I wish the razor would stay sharp for a longer period of time.  I used it for about a couple of weeks, and it&#x27;s already getting dull.  But overall, it&#x27;s pretty good for a women&#x27;s razor.</li>
    <li> Great idea, OK execution. Personally, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t trim as short as I like unless you remove the comb which then pulls &amp; yanks hairs. I think the idea is fabulous &amp; great for quick trimming. However, I like a much shorter trim. The razor is great. No complaints on that.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome razor. I was impressed with how close of a shave it provided. I loved the spacing of the blades compared to my old razor. Great product. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor, but mainly for the waterproof trimmer.  The razor itself is average. The hydrating strip works nicely but I noticed that after a couple uses the strip/gel stuff was pretty much gone.  On the other had, the trimmer is absolutely the best I have ever used.  The adjustable comb is perfect and I love that it can be used in the shower. All in all its a good razor with a great trimmer.. worth the money.</li>
    <li> Without too much description, I very recently had a baby and I was thrilled to receive this shaver as a BzzAgent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a battery operated shaver like this one before, rather I&#x27;ve always used an old beard trimmer of my boyfriend&#x27;s, but I was quite pleasantly surprised by the trimmer on this! I was very quickly able to trim and do so in a safe and effective manner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the regular shaver is a bit large for its intended purpose...however it was still perfectly manageable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using this product for quite some time!</li>
    <li> Loved this product! I received a sample product from BzzAgent. This was quick and efficient! It comes with a detachable come for varying lengths while trimming! There is no need for the extra time and expense of shaving cream with the water-activated moisturizing serum! I just used a little bit of water and was able to shave normally. With my old razor this would have left me with horrible razor burn! I just started using this product and I will not be using anything else!</li>
    <li> I received this free from BzzAgent and I absolutely love the razor! It makes my legs feel extremely smooth! I love that the handle is larger than any other razor so it is very easy to grasp onto in the shower. I do wish that the trimmer had an on/off button, instead of having to hold it down to trim. I really like the convenience of having both trimmer and razor in one.</li>
    <li> I was given this product to try from Schick, as a BzzAgent. I loved the close shave I received from using this razor. The blades work really well, and leave you soft and smooth. The blades last a really good amount of time. I reused the same blade many times before it was too dull. The trim style side is awesome. It is adjustable so you can get your desired length, and can even be used in the shower. I liked the ability to just trim certain areas easily. I asked my partner to try trim side. He is impossible when it comes to this, most of the time. It worked well for him too, and he liked that it was easy to use. Hopefully he will continue to use it! It comes with good battery that lasts awhile as well.  I have always liked Schick blades. I think they perform well. This is a cool new addition to the Schick family. One I will continue to use and I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I actually received this product free from BzzAgent to try and I am seriously beyond impressed. The Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini Trimmer just all around offers a great experience. It offers a close shave without breaking out my sensitive skin, and leaves my skin feeling completely soft and smooth. the bikini trimmer allows me to be extremely precise with out hurting or irritating my skin. I absolutely love this razor!</li>
    <li> I received thus product for free to review and test out. I was so excited to be accepted into this campaign.  I always have a hard time finding razors that do a good job. I always end up buying mens razors because they have more blades. This one is a great razor and I&#x27;m proud to say I no longer have to buy men&#x27;s razors. I will be buying this from now on.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product risk-free with a brand promotion through BzzAgent and this was an incredible experience. The trimmer was easy to handle, included the battery and the gel strip wasn&#x27;t gooey like other razors I&#x27;ve had, it was smooth and moisturizing. The razor end itself was sturdy and easy to hold, it was so smooth there was no need to maneuver around my knee, no cuts, no razor rash. I have even bought one since trying it, there were coupons included in my BzzAgent box! Great razor and trimmer.</li>
    <li> I received this razer free from BzzAgent. It provides an excellent shave with its 5 blades and moisturizing beads. I still need to use shaving cream or something else on my legs when using it or it is too drying. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have a use for the electric trimmer, but I actually like it and find it useful when I don&#x27;t feel like totally shaving certain areas &#x3D;D It&#x27;s nice that you can choose from a bunch of different length settings. It also has a nice plastic piece that allows you to sit the razor down on a surface flat without the blades touching anything. I also kind of like the thicker handle necessary for the electric razor.</li>
    <li> This razor is great! It&#x27;s compact in size and it made my legs, armpits and bikini area silky smooth! I love that it is 2 products in one! No more carrying around a trimmer and a razor when I go on vacation.  I love that there are moisturizers already on the head of the razor, no more need for me to buy shaving gel! The only down side to this razor is it is a little on the heavier side, but that is to be expected since there is a battery operated trimmer included.  i would HIGHLY recommend this razor to anyone that wants options and durability all in one!</li>
    <li> I received this free from Bzzagent to try it, and im so glad that they sent it to me. this is by far the best razor i have used. ( ALL opinions are my own)&lt;br /&gt;The thing i really like about this razor is how it leaves my skin feeling afterwards, smooth and soft. Never had any sort of razor burn or anything like that with this. love the design and how compact  it is. not too bulky and not too small. Shaves the tiniest hair in the hardest parts to get. i am loving my Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor. and i recommend you to try it out!</li>
    <li> Well, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried something like this. Now that I think of it, this is the first time I&#x27;ve heard of something like this; at least for the ladies.  I think the trimmer is a really cool idea. I used it on my bikini line and really am impressed with the results. I didn&#x27;t realize the comb doesn&#x27;t really work unless hair is dry, so I ended up it sans comb. Short isn&#x27;t bad though! Not a fan of the razor. It&#x27;s sharp which is to be expected. But, because of the addition of the trimmer, it&#x27;s quite bulky and heavy in the hand. No type of ergonomic handle that I can feel.  So I would prefer a separate trimmer and razor, for my needs at least.&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I received the product as part of the promotion from the brand</li>
    <li> I dread shaving and usually end up with a lot of razor burn but this has changed everything! I got this free from bzzagent to review and i absolutely love it. Very close and smooth shave with minimal razor burn! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this razor. It treats my legs and my bikini area with the respect they deserve. Makes me feel like a total goddess tbh. I got it a week or two ago from a BzzAgent promotion and I&#x27;m so glad I partook.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it&#x27;s compact, both of it&#x27;s components shave amazingly, it only requires one battery (included).&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the razor&#x27;s lubrication thingies wear off within about 5 shaves (?) and the replacements are suuuper spendy. (altho, it uses an average slider head thing, so, i&#x27;m sure other, possibly cheaper, heads could fit on it just fine?)</li>
    <li> I was able to test this product for free, thanks to BzzAgent and Schick! Thanks guys!&lt;br /&gt;What you see here is a pretty great razor. It has five curve sensing blades and a moisturizing guard, which means no razorburn, cuts, or nicks. It left my legs feeling baby soft, even without using a shave gel. They hydrating serum in the guard is fantastic! Onto the trimmer - I personally like a little bit of a closer shave, but I was still fairly pleased with the results. Having a little bit of hair is better than razorburn or cuts any day of the week. Will I buy this again? Definately. Worth every penny. It shaves so close I only shave every four days instead of every two. It&#x27;s just that good!</li>
    <li> I had very high expectations for the TrimStyle because I have used other Schick products in the past. The razor is fabulous as usual, but the trimmer isn&#x27;t the best. So far, I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with functioning, so it must actually be waterproof! Disclaimer: I received the product for free as a trial!</li>
    <li> I received this free through Bzzagent and I love it! This razor is phenomenal! I&#x27;ve always used Gillette Venus before but this is by far better! Always leaves my skin silky smooth and super soft! I love that the battery operated piece is waterproof so it makes shaving with it much easier!</li>
    <li> I have been using the original Venus model since they first hit the razor scene. Before them, I would look like I got attacked by a cat in the shower. These razors are even better. I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance with this. I had so many bad razor experiences, I haven&#x27;t even tried anything other than Venus in at least 2 years. I just stocked up on the Hydro Silk cartridges. I am a convert</li>
    <li> Thanks to Bzzagent I tried this product at no cost to me and would like to share my honest feedback.&lt;br /&gt;Based on my personal experience I would give the razor 5 stars and actual bikini trimmer only 1.  Here is why :&lt;br /&gt;Razor moisturizes really well  I even used it once without shaving cream and  my legs felt smooth and moisturized afterwards . I have very sensitive skin and this razor meets all of my expectations .&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately my experience with bikini trimmer wasn&#x27;t so great. I waited around 3 weeks ( pretty long period for that area)  to trim my bikini line. It honestly felt like it was scraping my skin and didn&#x27;t do really good job trimming at all. This trimmer is a great feature and probably would work for some women with thick hair and not so sensitive skin. Sadly not for me😢&lt;br /&gt;Overall 3 stars, great product just needs some improvements.</li>
    <li> Gives a really nice smooth shave with the blades and is able to remove even the thick hair on my husbands chest with the electric trimmer ( I wanted to test just how good it was). I received it free from BzzAgent.com! My only issue is that I have to remove the blades to use the electric trimmer so I don&#x27;t slip and cut myself again...(it doesn&#x27;t come with a cap for the blade). All in all though I really like it and will continue to use it until something better comes along because inevitably it will :)</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited when I received the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle from BzzAgent for free to try.  I don&#x27;t usually buy cheap razors but it&#x27;s unlikely that I would have splurged on this one.&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty dry skin on my legs and there is a definitely a noticeable difference when I use the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle.  I don&#x27;t even feel like I need to apply lotion.  The gel that does the lubricating does tend to continue to ooze out after I finish using the razor.  I&#x27;ve been using the razor for about a month now, 4 times a week, and the gel is just about gone.&lt;br /&gt;The razor gets a pretty close shave, but I can&#x27;t tell a difference between this razor or my Schick Quattro.  The fifth blade is nice but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d shell out extra money for it.&lt;br /&gt;I expected the razor to be heavier but it is also a little bulky and feels a bit awkward in my hand.  I leave the guard on the trimmer while I shave to avoid the potential danger of accidentally turning the trimmer on and nicking myself.  Since I like to keep things pretty short the guard comes right off when it&#x27;s time to use the trimmer.  The trimmer does a good job and I&#x27;m not concerned about cutting myself when I use it, which is important in such a delicate area.  I also love that the trimmer can be used in the shower, it&#x27;s super convenient.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use the razor until it dulls and the trimmer until it breaks, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about bikini trimmer, doesn&#x27;t cut as easy and it&#x27;s awkward to hold</li>
    <li> My new favorite razor, I got this free to try and LOVE it!  Your skin is left soft and smooth and the bikini razor is perfect for summer bikini maintenance!  It moisturizes well and is now my new favorite razor!</li>
    <li> received #Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® razor free  from Bzzagent.  I am in love!  I have gotten rid of all other razors.  The moisturizer strip is awesome, my skin feels soft and smooth. The trimmer works wonders and so easy to use. Have been wishing for an item like this for years!</li>
    <li> Thanks to BZZ I got to try this wonderful product for free! Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle is a great feminine tool that is super easy to use! With its water proof technology as a plus I no longer need to worry about getting my trimmer wet! I personally liked the small handle, and the trimmer was the size of my thumb nail to easily glide on small areas. You can trim with the guard on, or if you want shorter hair, you can take the guard off. This is a very simple but efficient tool, it did as exactly as it was supposed to for a fraction of the cost on more top brand trimmers. I expect to be using this in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#thanks2bzz #igotitfree</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen or use a good women razor. Since trying out Hydro Schick. Now my hubby is using my trimmer basically he stole mine.. lol. It&#x27;s ok I went over to Target and bought a new one.. I love the Hydro Schick! It makes my skin soft because of the moisture strips. The 5 blades make my shave experience so much better. Leaving my legs smooth and the trimmer adjusts to different lengths and I can use it in the shower or out. Wow! Schick Hydro Silk Trim Style is the only razor that delivers all your leg and bikini care needs in one tool. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I love all of the unique features this razor offers. From the battery powered trimmer that offers such a close shave, to the razor that features 5 blades and a moisturizing strip. My legs and bikini area feel smooth for days longer then they would with any other razor I&#x27;ve used before!</li>
    <li> Wife says it works great, very satisfied</li>
    <li> I find the razor side very good and it does leave your skin pretty smooth! I do find this product not for everybody because I didn&#x27;t have a chance to use the trimmer side since I had nothing to trim! :D But it is good product  for somebody who travels and need to have both tools with them! Loved the little plastic underneath the blade side to support it from touching any surface and damaging the blades and dissolve moisture strip! That one alone was a big must!“Received a free product”</li>
    <li> I received this for free as part of a promotion from Schick and BzzAgent. Although the design sounds good in theory, I was not impressed with the TrimStyle. I guess it is more convenient than having an electric trimmer AND a razor, but the design is bulky and makes it difficult to maneuver around curves. It also makes too much going on in one device. You aren&#x27;t reinventing the wheel, it&#x27;s just a trim/shave. The razor side is the same as the HydroSilk razors, which have great blade action but have a slimy feel when using it. Legs do feel nice and soft after a shave, once you&#x27;ve rinsed the slime off. I used the trimmer once and will never use it again. The trim length settings were useless, unless your hair is very long and you want it to remain long. I removed the guard (trim length 0) and used it in the shower, and it was painful to use. The metal teeth that guard the blade are sharp and dug into my sensitive skin. It is good that you can click the button down to turn on and it stays on, and click it down again to turn off, but it did not stay on unless you really pushed it down hard. I was halfway through my (frustrating) trim before I realized it would stay on. I gave two stars because the razor side is good, and the rubbery coating on the handle gives a good grip. Overall, this is not worth the money and I would not recommend it to my girlfriends.</li>
    <li> I just love this incdible idea  to make a trim in the same  razor  this change a lot  the shave and no have  a mess  all over the place whit diferrents razor and other things to get better results  .this razor and trim is great to womans like  me in need  to get  a closer shave  i dont need to borrow anymore the trim to my  husband :) thanks to a this amazing razor and trim im in love i recive this product free to try  from the brand</li>
    <li> With summer coming up, i decided to give this razor a try after receiving it for free from BzzAgent. I am very familiar with Schick products, but have never ventured out to trying a battery powered trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The razor side was amazing, it shaved nicely and smoothly. It worked well on my legs, and surprisingly well on my bikini area, however i did still experience bumps and redness even with bikini cream application after showers.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer part was the portion that intrigued me the most, and unfortunately was a bit of a let down. The tugging the trimmer caused on my hairs was an obvious sign of its cheapness. I enjoyed the fact it came with many heads, but overall i think there are probably better trimmers out there but of course for a more expensive price.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever tried an electric bikini trimmer and I was very impressed. Gone are the days of trying to groom down there with a regular razor; getting cuts and burns and dull blades! It worked very easily and quickly, giving me a great trim. The razor/trimmer handle seemed a little large at first, but it was actually easier to hold onto which is nice since sometimes contortion poses are required to get all the right areas! You do have to hold the button down for it to be on, that is probably my only drawback to this product, hence the 4 stars. It would be nice to switch it on and off instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flipping it around to use the regular razor for my legs is just as simple and I get a nice smooth shave. I also love the way the design has a little bumped area so when I set it down, the razor is not resting directly on anything, but lifted up. I find this extends the life of blades considerably if they are not sitting in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After opening the packaging, I was looking around for instructions on how to insert the battery, and came to find they were printed on the inside back of the box behind a blank insert. The only thing I would recommend is putting the directions on the insert instead, since that is what I generally look for if I have questions. I figured it out easily enough, but I did have to destroy the box completely to read everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has become my new razor/trimmer of choice, and I plan on recommending it to everyone who is in the market for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle to try for free through BzzzAgent.</li>
    <li> Received this free product as a part of buzzagent to review. I would absolutely pay for this product! It provided such a moisturizing, close shave that lasted for days. I was impressed that it came with a battery in the box, that I can replace when needed. The bikini side of the razor was effective and easy to use. The product is a bit thicker than my normal razors but they pack a lot of goodness in there. The vibration was nice but I felt like with all the moisture around the razor blades themselves I didn&#x27;t need to use the vibrations all the time. When in a hurry I didn&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> My friends and I used the buzzer to shave me an undercut hair style. The small buzzer made creating a sharp neatly buzzed line easy and I am SO happy with how my hair looks. Using a regular buzzer would have been clunky and awkward and would not have created such a nice final product. Although I received the buzzer as part of a promotion from the brand, I have discovered that it is is good for many things: bikini line, head shaving, or under arm care. 10/10, would absolutely recommend.</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand, and I&#x27;m very glad I did. It&#x27;s been the first electronic razor that I have ever tried. I was a little worried in the beginning about using it because I didn&#x27;t want it irritating my sensitive skin. Luckily it did not. Even during the winter, I prefer having the majority of my body hair *wink wink* shaved for personal reasons. The bikini trimmer that comes on the same razor helps me achieve this much easier than by using a disposable razor in comparison. It does appear to be durable and long lasting, and it&#x27;s definitely water-proof as the packaging states. I gotta say, it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
    <li> I got this from bzzahent, &amp; i am absolutely in love. definitely my go to. :)</li>
    <li> I just received this razor in a Bzz agent campaign &amp; it seriously has to be the greatest invention in razor history! Omgosh! If you maintain your bikini area, you NEED this! The waterproof trimmer built right into your razor makes removing &amp; trimming up hair so easy! And this is the first razor Ever that hasn&#x27;t caused ingrown hairs! Ahhhhmaziiing! I&#x27;m never going back to any other razor!  I need to go buy several as back ups!  :)</li>
    <li> I really like this product. For those that have spend so much time trimming their bikini area this makes it so much easier. I don&#x27;t have to spend so much because of this and it has an adjustable trim clip for those that don&#x27;t like it too short and for those that don&#x27;t like it long either. The razor glides very smoothly and I&#x27;m happy with this product :)</li>
    <li> I received my Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor from Bzzagent about 2 weeks ago for free. I was hoping that after using this razor I would have smoother and moisturized skin. When I used it I was totally happy with the results. I totally recommended buying.</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a free item to try from bzzz agent and this razor works wonders. Hello silky legs! It works quickly with a close shave, better than most u have tried in the past. Well worth the money to buy the refills for!</li>
    <li> I must say that this razor and trimmer is awesome. Truthfully, I thought this was too good to believe because it is both a razor and a trimmer for your bikini line....how awesome is that!! Moreover, I got this product free thanks to bzzagent so I can give my utmost honest opinion. Moreover, this razor was really smooth when I used it on my legs. I also like the design of the product especially the colors. When the razor/trimmer is turned on, it starts to shake uncontrollably which I don&#x27;t mind at all as it gives me the results I want. It is a great product for those who want to shave their legs and trim their bikini line. I, personally recommend this product as it made my legs more smooth than any other razor. What is even more better is that it makes my bikini line look really good! Now, I am ready for bikini season!</li>
    <li> This is an all in one tool made for women. Is a great product, must have it... #GotItFree thanks to Schick and for been a bzzagent</li>
    <li> This is a good razor. I love the five blades and the water activated moisturizer. However the moisturizer does get a bit sticky and it can be a hassle at times. The move-ability in the head is great for the curves such as the knees but I don&#x27;t really understand how to use the trimming bit. I received this as a part of a promotion from the company otherwise I probably would not have purchased but I will probably repurchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Best razor and trimmer i ever used.</li>
    <li> This is literally the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried so many different types and brands of razors in the past, but nothing compares to this one, which I was very pleasantly surprised by as I had received this as a free product sample to test. However, as it turns out, this razor is absolutely amazing and it is a product that I will definitely continue using for a long time, and one that I plan to purchase also. What I love most about this razor is the range of motion that the head of the razor has, which makes my shaving process so much easier and more comfortable. Second, I really like the moisturizing beads next to the razor blades, which help make the razor glide very smoothly along my skin, while also moisturizing it in the process. Third, the 5 razor blades are certainly a plus, as they make sure that all the hairs are removed. As for the bikini trimmer portion, I haven&#x27;t tried that yet as it&#x27;s still 40-50F where I live so it&#x27;ll be a quite a while before I need to shave that region, but from what I can tell the adjustable length comb seems like a great feature as I love product customizability, so I will definitely take advantage of that when I get around to using it. Overall, this razor went above and beyond my expectations and I am so glad that I was able to discover it through the free product sample given to me. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new, excellent razor to purchase!</li>
    <li> The razor works really great and I like it a lot.  I can get a really close shave with it.  However, I&#x27;m not a fan of the bikini trimmer.  I mean, it works ok if you&#x27;re desperate but don&#x27;t expect miracles.  An actual bikini trimmer is much better suited for the bikini area.  The trimmer is tiny and isn&#x27;t very powerful.  It&#x27;s ok for saving time in the shower, but I prefer to just use the razor only.  I received my razor as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product as a free sample thanks to the BzzAgent site.  I have been using Schick Hydro ever since Schick first released the mens version a few years back so the razor I expected to be a great as the others and it was.  I love the smooth shave it provides with little to know razor burn at all.  The trimmer edge could have been better designed.  I did not have the best results with it and ironically my significant other just by looking at it himself was not at all impressed with the simply vibrations back and forth.  That part still could use improvements so that people who don&#x27;t always have the greatest amount of hair can still benefit down there &#x3D;P</li>
    <li> This is the BEST razor ever! Leaves your skin smooth and makes shaving easy and faster.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try this razor through BzzAgent and it is amazing! My legs are very sensitive, usually I am unable to shave daily because of it. This razor has such a smooth clean shave, I have no issues! The blade is still sharp and fresh even after a month of use! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Wow! I have been an avid Venus user for many years. This hydro silk option is the best of both worlds and worked really well for me. I live through it had the trimmer option also to keep the bikini line neat.&lt;br /&gt;*received a free product.</li>
    <li> Thank you BzzAgent for sending me this heavenly razor as a free sample. Perfect for trimming and then shaving low and with minor irritation! the moisturizing strip is perfect and leaves my legs feeling soft and smooth. If you have sensitive skin this is the razor for you! It has adjustable settings for the trimmer! Really what more can you ask for.</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I recently received one of these for free in the mail! I was super excited to try it - I&#x27;ve got a beach trip coming up that it would have been perfect for, but I was not impressed. After only 3 days of using it, the &amp;#34;sensitive skin strip&amp;#34; on the razor had been reduced to this oozing gel that hung out of the razor (gross?). I was able to remove it after it had clogged the blades to the point where it wasn&#x27;t usable. After it was gone, I had a much better shave. The bikini trimmer is great, but I was less than thrilled with the razor.</li>
    <li> I have a very hard time finding razors that work well, so when I could sign up for the BzzAgent campaign to receive the TrimStyle Razor, I jumped right on it. I have an issue with ingrown hairs. Since I started using this 3 weeks ago, I have noticed that I don&#x27;t have any ingrown hairs at all. Nor have I nicked myself using the razor. Very good for sensitive skin as well. I love the larger handle for a better grip and I actually got much more use out of the trimmer than I had expected. If you have sensitive skin and ingrown hair issues, this razor is the way to go.</li>
    <li> The trim style razor is a great concept. Schick always has the best razors. Never get any razor burn or cuts. I recently decided to wear shorts for the first time this season and realized my legs were a mess before walking out the door. I pulled out this razor and splashed some water on my legs. The razor did not cut me and did not clog up. It was quick and painless. I have been trying out the trimmer side on my bikini line. This is tricky for me since I have never used a trimmer. Overall it is ideal since it does not lead to any pain or sensitivity in the bikini line like a normal razor. Also no ingrown hairs which happens every time i shave. Trimming your bikini line is much better than shaving and this trim style razor is a much better alternative to stealing my boyfriends razor. I did receive this product for review.</li>
    <li> I got this through buzz agent (thanks buzz agent) and I must say it is a nice razor. It came with a battery already included and that is different and I appreciate that fact. It had a study feel to it and its comfortable, it&#x27;s definitely bigger than most razors. The blades work well I had a close shave and it was very moisturizing. I like the fact that it vibrated this is the first time I tried a razor with this feature and it worked well (make sure to hold the button down or press it a couple times for it to stay vibrating without needing to hold it down). After I used it,my skin was very soft however I should have used a shaving creme. I had some serious razor burn for a couple days and it hurt like nobody&#x27;s business however I feel like its due to my sensitive skin which is why I gave 4 stars. The Bikini trimmer works well and I felt confident in not cutting myself using it, the design is good. I will continue to use it but maybe with shaving creme so it won&#x27;t hurt as bad on my legs. I will never go back to BIC razors again..ever!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free to test out and I love it!  The shave end has 5 blades to give you a close shave and the trimmer makes it easier than ever to keep your bikini area groomed.  The trim guard even adjusts to customize your trim length.  I&#x27;ve knocked this off of my shower door a few times and although the blades popped off, it was easy to snap it back together again.  It would be nice if they made replacement blades for the trimmer so you wouldn&#x27;t have to buy another unit when they eventually dull.  However, I think that it is going to take a long time for them to dull.  I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I received the Shcick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini trimmer as a participant in a BzzAgent trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the regular razor head. The blades have lasted longer than I expected them too and it&#x27;s been a smooth close shave. The downside is that I&#x27;m pretty sure the mosturizing serum doesn&#x27;t do much... but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a brand issue so much as an industry wide issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the bikini trimmer... there is some serious power behind that little thing. It works super well but I feel like the head could be a little smaller as I inevitably knicked myself. That being said, the battery of this little device is still going strong and I have not been jolted by any stray electricity (I was a little worried lol). I am also pretty happy with the button placement and that it doesn&#x27;t turn on at the drop of a hat! That could be very bad when trying to shave other body parts. The big downfall to this part of the razor is that my husband has discovered it and now uses it in his own regimen.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love that there are 5 blades on the razor head. I get a clean and smooth shave without any nicks or cuts. The blade is covered by moisturizing strips that glide on the skin. The thickness of the razor is also ideal because its easy to grip and hold, unlike the thinner razors that tend to easily slip out of my grip. The only drawback is the trimmer on the other end. I have always found the regular razor blades to work perfectly and think that a trimmer is excessive and unnecessary.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from bzzagent to test and review. This gets all thumbs up from me. The razor is super sharp with 5 blades and a moisturizing gel/serum. I have sensitive skin so the fact that it&#x27;s hypoallergenic is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer at the other end is awesome. The waterproof claim proved true when I used mine in the shower. This is great because no one wants to deal with sweeping up hair after grooming right? It has an easy on and off switg and came with a battery! The trimmer reminds me of my husband&#x27;s clippers with the adjustable comb. It has 4 stages that allows you to have 4 sizes/levels for hair length.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Not really loving this product. The bikini trimmer is nice, but the razor is awful for my legs. It didn&#x27;t give me a very close shave, and the moisturizing strip just irritated my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll stick with men&#x27;s razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product from bzzagent.com</li>
    <li> I am an easy pleaser when it comes my razors. I can go to the store and pick up some 3 blade disposable razors and be perfectly content with my shave. So when I accepted the campaign on bzzagent to try out this 2 in 1 razor/trimmer, I was very excited. However, I am a logical person, so in my mind I was thinking, &amp;#34;how could this razor/trimmer which is only $15 in stores be any good&amp;#34;? It came with an electric trimmer that has four settings AND a 5 blade razor, at $15! . Allow me to fill you in on my first impressions, and experience with the razor and trimmer. First impressions: The packaging was nice and easy to open. The razor is pretty chunky, but I liked that about it. I liked having a good grip on it. I was ecstatic to see that it came with a battery in the packaging for the trimmer end, so I turned it on and tried it out immediately. The razor was difficult to take apart to get the battery in, but I figured it out pretty quickly. It also came with pictured instructions in the back of the box. Razor usage: The razor was very comfortable to use, and it gave a really close shave leaving my legs really smooth. The moisturizing serum was really nice as well. My legs felt the best they had ever felt after my shave. Normally, I will lotion my legs after shaving, but with this serum I didn&#x27;t have to. However, while the moisturizing serum is very nice, when I rinsed the razor head under the faucet, you could see the serum washing off of the blade. This makes me wonder how long it will last on the razor. Overall, the razor was good, but I hope that it will continue to be this good after several uses. Trimmer usage: I loved the trimmer on this razor. This is the part that exceeded my expectations. I thought for sure this trimmer would only last for one shave, or have no power behind it, I was VERY skeptical. I have now used this trimer 4 times and it is still going strong! I prefer to use the trimmer without the guard, but I like it to be a close shave. Another plus to this trimmer is that with me enjoying my shaves close, I tend to get red bumps/razor burn frequently when tending to the bikini area. I have not had this issue using the trimmer and that makes me ecstatic! All in all, I have found a new shaving BFF. The razor part is good, but the trimmer is great! Thanks bzzagent for introducing me to my new love!us to this trimmer is that with me enjoying my shaves close, I tend to get red bumps/razor burn frequently when tending to the bikini area. I have not had this issue using the trimmer and that makes me ecstatic! All in all, I have found a new shaving BFF. The razor part is good, but the trimmer is great! Thanks bzzagent for introducing me to my new love!</li>
    <li> I received this as a free product to review. I prefer the Schick Quattro TrimStyle Razor, but this is also great. The main reason why this isn&#x27;t a five star review is because I received razor bumps on my legs from the shave.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I had the pleasure of trying for Free thanks to Bzzagent and Schick. After shaving with the razor my skin feels silky smooth and the trimmer gets nice and close without any nicks or cuts. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Thanks to BuzzAgent I got to try this product out for free! The grip is comfortable the razor is a perfect size and the results are amazing! I have sensitive skin so I really needed a product that would not irritate my skin but also give me the results I am looking for. My legs are super smooth and no irritation. I had no trouble going from my legs to my bikini area. I mean you seriously flip the razor over and click the on botton! Super easy. Replacement blades are also reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I def. love this product! it truly is the best of both worlds! the razor and the trimmer are awesome! you should def try this product out! i got i free through bzzagent and im so glad that i was apart of that campaign one of the best thus far!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! I received this to try and I was so excited to use it from the get go, and let me tell you, I was NOT disappointed! So easy to use and left my legs silky smooth. I love the serum on the razor, helped it glide right across my legs, and left no razor burn! I usually dread the first use with my Venus razor, or any razor for that matter for that very reason, but not this one. No pain, just beauty ☺️. And I love that I can use it for my Bikini area too. All in one.. And waterproof! Can&#x27;t beat that! Now go get one. Hurry!</li>
    <li> I did receive this product for free, However I would not lie to my viewers, I wouldn&#x27;t lie just because it was for free. This razor/trim combo is wonderful! it is so convenient, and a time saver. The trim side is adjustable depending on your preferences. The razor side has a moisture strip that works very well for me. But i left it upside down in my shower for a few days and from other hot showers most of it oozed out of the strip. But that is my user error.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor free from Bzzagent for testing and review purposes. I have been a BIG fan of Schick Razors ever since I started shaving and since the Schick Hydro Silk first came out, it&#x27;s been the only razor I&#x27;ll buy. I have to admit, I was pretty excited when they introduced the TrimStyle since it combines my favorite razor with a handy wet/dry trimmer! The razor half is amazing! It has 5 blades which shave extremely close to your skin and leave it stubble free and so silky smooth. The razor end easily glides over every inch and around all your curves and comes equipped with not 1 but 2 moisturizing strips which are instantly activated with water contact so there&#x27;s no need for any additional use of shave creams. I like the addition of the trimmer since it makes it very convenient to not only get your legs &amp; underarms hair free, but it makes keeping your bikini area looking great. The trimmer side has 4 adjustable length settings to best suit your preferences. The only problem I had with the trimmer and the reason I&#x27;m giving this razor 4 stars is just because I was hoping the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t be able to catch your skin when set at the shortest length setting. It&#x27;s not bad, but you just have to be careful when trimming in delicate areas. Besides that, the is an amazing razor and a great product overall. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received a product sample for review, but all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is really a two-in-one with a trimmer. The razor itself is excellent. It did not nick, but got a close shave on the first use. It has in it a built in serum which really does help, and the blades seem to curve even in tricky spots such as my knee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer side has a removable comb with various lengths. It&#x27;s a great, basic trimmer. I love that it&#x27;s waterproof - I just keep it right with me in the shower</li>
    <li> I did receive this product as a free sample.That being said, the handle is a bit bulky for me, I am used to the thinner Schick razors for women and they are easier to hold onto for me. This does provide a great shave and silky smooth results. I also wish it came with something to hang it up in the shower to keep out of reach of little hands or at the least a cover for the trimmer and blades.</li>
    <li> Finally an easy solution to bikini care.  I received this razor as a free sample from Bzzagent.  I have used it for a few weeks now and I love it.  It has adjustable settings on the trimmer end and a removable cap so it&#x27;s easy to clean.  I love that it&#x27;s waterproof and I haven&#x27;t noticed any rust in the battery compartment.  The battery life is good so far.  The razor end is about on par with other similar razors I&#x27;ve tried, not really anything special but it did do a great job and left my legs silky smooth. I love that it&#x27;s two in one.</li>
    <li> I received my TrimStyle as a promotion.  This razor was pretty cool. It took a little getting used to with the trimmer. Practice makes perfect!  My legs are sooo smooth with no bumps.  If you have sensitive skin, it&#x27;s defiantly for you!  The razor part is a little big for the bikini area, but with all the moisturizer, there is no irritation after shaving.  Thank you for letting me try it.</li>
    <li> This is a handy, dandy gadget of a razor.  It&#x27;s the schick hydro silk on steroids!  The look is of a simple razor but while the razor works so well, the base is hiding in pure site, an adjustable bikini trimmer.  This is the perfect compliment to the bikini days of summer!  The razor adjusts to my curves and glides over my skin while hydrating at the same time.  One quick turn and I am able to trim and precisely adjust small areas, it is the best of all world&#x27;s for a shaving female population!  The trimmer can be used in or out of the shower, it&#x27;s the best of all worlds!  Thank you bzzagent for sending me a sample to use!</li>
    <li> WOW, I received the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle to try out and review from BzzAgent... and I can honestly say that this is an awesome razer and bikini trimmer in one. The razer has built in moisturization that let&#x27;s it slide smoothly over your legs and under arms. I have super sensitive skin and get razer bumps really easily when I shave... but not with this Schick...it left me smooth, razer bump free and a super close shave.  I was a little worried that the trimmer side would not be powerful enough to trim my bikini area, since it was powered by a AAA battery... but it really worked well. It has an adjustable comb for different lengths or you can remove that totally for the closest trim. The best part is it completely water proof. I really suggest giving the Schick Hydro Silk  TrimStyle a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I would definitely purchase this again and will be getting the refill cartridges.. anything that works well on my sensitive skin and leaves it this smooth is a win for me :)</li>
    <li> I received my Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini, to review thanks to Bzz Agent! I tried it out for the first time 2 days ago, and I was pleasantly surprised but how smooth and silky my legs felt. I usually have to use a lot of shaving cream to avoid nicks and cuts, but with this razor a little went a long way. The handle is a little bulky compared to what I normally use since the razors I use are slimmer, also they have no battery like the Hydro SIlk TrimStyle Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used a bikini trimmer so this was new territory for me especially since it&#x27;s battery operated. I took my time and I didn&#x27;t use the attachment with it since I wanted to see how close I could get. I loved it, I could get very close to the skin, didn&#x27;t cut the skin and left my bikini area nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great product. Thanks to bzzAgent i recieved it free. Works well, but can cut you very easily and it hurts so be careful.</li>
    <li> This razor really gave me a smooth shave.  It didn&#x27;t cut me one time.  I do have sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t get razor burn or anything.  The trimmer side didn&#x27;t pull or tug and gave me a clean trim.</li>
    <li> Just like most women out there, I have tried every razor out there. This is hands down my favorite! The bikini trimmer is amazing, it leaves a nice clean shave and doesn&#x27;t pinch like some other trimmers. It is waterproof so no need to worry about leaving it in the shower and the battery in my last one easily lasted a year until I tossed it. The schick razors give me the closest, smoothest shave of any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer -  I did receive this product for free as a promotion from Schick; it did not influence my review in any way.</li>
    <li> I received this shaver for free to try out by Bzzagent. This shaver works great for a quick and effective way of removing hair. The electronic side cuts hair quickly and without any pulling. The shaver itself cuts nicely and glides smoothly across the legs leaving no hair behind. I pair this with the hydro silk shaving cream and the two work like a dream together. I would recommend this to anyone looking to have smooth legs for the summer. The price is on point as well! This is the perfect item to use during the summer months on those days when you are wearing a bikini!</li>
    <li> I really like the razor it glides down your legs, it definitely got all the hair off the first time. It left my skin really smooth, no bumps. It is not heavy but it is bigger than a traditional razor handle, but it&#x27;s not completely uncomfortable but you do have to get used to it. The one thing I did not like is the ON/OFF button location, I kept accidentally clicking on it while I was using it to shave my legs.  The trimmer is nice, I had never used one, I liked it!! :)  It has 3 different lengths you can adjust to, it does make noise but it&#x27;s nothing you can&#x27;t deal with. it has comb, to help grasp the hair, it IS waterproof so, you can use it while in the shower. Another thing I liked, it is very easy to clean, you just take the comb part off and voila!&lt;br /&gt;*I received this free to try from BzzAgent</li>
    <li> Received this free from bzzagent to test. For starters, it&#x27;s very convenient having the razor and trimmer on one handle. The razor itself is great and works just as well as any other 5 blade razor. The trimmer is really good as well, but it would be a little easier to use if you didn&#x27;t have to hold down the button the whole time. The only issue with the trimmer is that you can&#x27;t get a very close trim without taking the guard off, which means you have to be fairly careful down there. The handle is also very sturdy and is easy to hold but would be nice if you could hang it on the shower wall (maybe next version?).</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I received it for free for testing and I&#x27;m so glad I did! It&#x27;s very easy to use and both ends help to get an even shave every time.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not for thick hair, but the trimmer works well in and out of water and the moisture bar on the razor is AWESOME!</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST RAZOR in the Market ! I received this Razor FREE as a Product Tester/Reviewer . I am extremely amazed at how well it preformed . It gives you a close shave no matter which side you use . No nicks, cuts , scratches from using it either . Just a Close ,Smooth ,Soft shave . I Highly Recommend this product . You won&#x27;t be disappointed with it . I won&#x27;t be using any other razor but the Schick Hydro Silk from now on .</li>
    <li> I Love this razor I was fortunate to try it for free Its a great product Schick has always been my favorite razor and this one in particular just proved the point in why Schick is the best in the business it gave me the closest shave I ever had and gave you that great after shave feeling that we all want and the razor works great as well I would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite shaving product to date! Here is why! I have used many razors over the years, and Im sure every women has, but this one is so much different than all the other razors there is! When using Schick Hydro TrimStyle Razor it felt like silk being wrapped around my legs! They have a great gel inside of the razor head that works wonders on smoothing your skin and making sure the blades dont tug or pull the hair but instead gently removing the hair. Normally I would have to shave 2-3 times each leg to make sure I got all the hair, but with Schick Hydro I only had to shave 1 time!! How many razors can say that? No razor bumps,or burns!  Now for the trimmer! There are 3 settings you can use to define which length you would like it. My favorite was taking the guard off and using it that way! Best way to get all the stubborn hair from your bikini area! I suggest using Skinmate shaving gel with the razor as it gives even more benefits! Received a free product!</li>
    <li> Oh, Schick...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven’t been this excited about receiving a free razor since college, when I was given a sample Quattro. You do know how to hook a girl! Speaking of which, let’s get the obligatory disclaimer out of the way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a BzzAgent, and as such, I’m sometimes asked to try, review, and spread “bzz” about certain products. Said products are sent to me free of charge, but my reviews are always honest and in no way swayed by this fact. What you are about to read is my personal opinion on the Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle®.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unboxing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took out the Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® and turned it over in my hands. Style-wise, it wasn’t bad to look at. It seemed fairly gender neutral, had a little stand built in to help it balance, and—ack! The razor end had no cap/shield on it. Brushing against it shot a chill up my spine, like I’d almost filleted my finger. *shutter* We’ll assume my lack of perception was to blame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on, I discovered that the iinstructions had been printed in the most inconvenient place possible: the inside of the package. Having ripped it trying to get the box open, I found myself ever so slightly dismayed. Then again, would I really need instructions for a razor? Once I read where the battery compartment was, I tossed the box and didn’t give it a second thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and speaking of which... THE BATTERY WAS INCLUDED! *content sigh*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can be friends again, Schick. I forgive you for not protecting me against your five Curve Sensing® blades and printing on the inside of the box. In fact, I’m ready to try out your razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me preface this by saying I have ridiculously sensitive legs. Most days, if I’m in any kind of hurry whilst shaving, I bleed everywhere. If my dog jumps on me, I get paw-print bruises. Such is life. That’s why I never expect the type of shave you see on razor commercials—you know, the scenarios where women are lounging poolside, letting hot stranger-dudes caress their thighs...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Ahem.) I may have to adjust those expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® gave me the smoothest shave I’ve ever had in my life. I kid you not. It even glided around my knee with ease—my knee! Those Curve Sensing® blades are no joke. I think I love them. &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer was... all right. I appreciated the narrow head and the fact that it had a little comb on it, but I ended up finishing with the razor end. (I’d already gotten addicted to feeling silky. There was no turning back, for me. LOL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® is a great dual-purpose razor. I definitely see myself purchasing refill blades in the near future. :)women are lounging poolside, letting hot stranger-dudes caress their thighs...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Ahem.)

    <li> I recieved mine in the mail free from Bzzagent.com, and let me just say I love it!  Love that it is a two in one, it makes things so convenient. The blades make shaving as smooth as can be. The trim feature also works very easily with a click of a button. Who could ask for a better razor with great quality.</li>
    <li> this is simply the best thing a girl can have! I recieved mine in a kit for free by being a BzzAgent! I never even thought anyone would come up with an idea like this! It is so nice to have one object that does the job of 2 objects, and does it very well! It is worth the price if you like a really good shave!</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best razor I have ever used. I have extremely sensitive skin and no matter what razor, shave gel, or post-shave soother I used I always got red bumps on my legs and bikini area. This silk razor is amazing. You can definitely tell how close of a shave you receive after the first swipe of the razor. When I shaved my bikini area I felt much more comfortable because it produced a real clean shave, instead of swiping over one area multiple times and causing the skin to become irritated. The bikini trimmer is fantastic. I previously never owned something like this and now couldn&#x27;t imagine living without it. The comb is adjustable by clicking it in and out, rather than having multiple combs. You can remove the comb completely for a close trim. I found this useful for other areas that get some hair such as my happy trail, ankles, etc. I previously used one of those battery operated facial wands you see on tv. This is so much better. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive this razor from amazon I received it from #bzzAgent to test out and I have to say this is one of the best razors I have ever used bigger for better gripping also the trimmer works wonders</li>
    <li> I received this razor free because I am a bzz agent. It is awesome and way better than I thought it would be. I will admit I don&#x27;t let my hair grow long enough to use the trimmer, but the razor itself keeps my legs smooth so much longer.</li>
    <li> I was able to try the product for free through BzzAgent. I have to admit at first I was skeptical, but it turns out this was an amazing amazing razor! I&#x27;ve used it multiple times! No razor burn, no cuts, no issues! It works wonders, and leaves smooth and silky skin afterwards! I will definitely be buying refills!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m genuinely impressed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I received it in the mail via a BzzAgent campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor glides well and gave me a close shave without causing razor burn and nicks (which I am admittedly prone to getting). It&#x27;s easy to grip and the weight was just right for me. My legs felt smooth and hydrated for quite a long time afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend this product? Definitely!</li>
    <li> I love the razor, it is better than my Venus, the trimmer however did not meet my expectations</li>
    <li> This is a terrific razor that gives a close cut with no nicks. It left my legs smooth and non-irritated. The trimmer is good, but not the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s a good size, comfortable to hold, and waterproof which is a bonus. I got mine to try for free from BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> I recived this product for free from Bzz Agent.Loving my Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor! It&#x27;s five blades &amp; moisturizing strips leave my skin super smooth without even having to use a shave cream! If you want a close, comfortable shave you&#x27;ll need this! My bikini line was definitely needing some tlc and with that razor it has the convconvenience of both all in one without the bumps and rash</li>
    <li> As a mother and a wife it&#x27;s hard to find the time to shave my legs every other day which is what I&#x27;ve had to do for years. UNTIL NOW! I was concerned this would be just another razor. I&#x27;ve used Venus razors for years thinking this is as good as it gets. But then started using the Schick trim style razor. I haven&#x27;t had any more razor burn since I started using this! There is 5 blades so I get such a smooth shave that I shave half as often! This razor is so easy to keep ahold of and works great in all areas with no cuts!! This has by far been my best Experience with av razor. I have more confidence and less razor Burns! This will be the best summer ever!!!!</li>
    <li> I received a free Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle Razor as part of a promotion from the brand.. I purchased&lt;br /&gt;Skintimate Shave Gel first and used it also when I shaved. I shaved my legs and bikini area. I have only used this twice and I cant believe how soft and smooth it has made my skin. The waterproof trimmer truly is convenient! As a woman getting a close shave is extremely important and with this I was able to get that. Using other razors I have also seen some skin irritation but so far with this razor I haven&#x27;t, which means to me this is like the perfect razor. I would highly recommend purchasing!</li>
    <li> I love my new Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle. I&#x27;m glad I #GotItFree, because I don&#x27;t think I would ever bye it. After trying it out twice all I can say is Wow, my legs are super soft, and NO red bumps. My husband can&#x27;t stop touching..#gotitfreeBzzAgent</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent I got to meet my new shower buddy. Schick always delivers great products, and this is definitely one of them. The razor blades are great, can&#x27;t even feel them but you can see work is done. The trimmer is a huge plus. This will definitely speed up shaving time in the shower. Have not tried it outside of the shower for a quick trim yet, but I&#x27;m sure it is just as efficient. Really love this product!</li>
    <li> I received this razor courtesy of bzzagent for testing purposes. For the sake of the review, I will be brutally honest. I have not shaved my legs, bikini, or underarms in around a month. So, I was excited for the trimmer aspect of the razor, as I would be able to trim what I needed to. However, I was very disappointed. The trimmer barely cut any hair. The razor worked slightly better. I did not feel that the shave was close enough. I was also annoyed by the large area around the razor. I&#x27;m going to stick with my mens&#x27; razors for now, a much closer shave, for a much cheaper price.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I got to try it for free through BzzAgent. Smooth silky moisurizer. Nice close shave. Love that you can shave the bikini line. Perfect and just in time for summer. My new Best Friend. Thank You</li>
    <li> As a venus user for years. I wad hesitant. This 2 for 1 was a great deal and I love the flexability of thr razors and the smooth shave I got. and the bikini trimmer is a definate plus.</li>
    <li> Love the razor! Super close shave and having the trimmer there was great too. Water proof and save to use in the shower. I had a really close shave with out the razor burn- I didn&#x27;t even use shaving cream!</li>
    <li> ***I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand***&lt;br /&gt;I have been waiting for a trimmer like this!  Sometimes if i let things get... out of hand...it can be a real pain to get everything nice and trimmed up.  Using the TrimStyle is great because I can trim everything down nice and short and then shave all with one tool and in the shower. It&#x27;s easy to use and  I got a nice close shave! I have pretty sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t cause any kind of irritation. It has cut down my shower time a bit too, I use it for my bikini area, legs, and under arms! I would totally recommend this product and think it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I received this from BzzAgent to try for FREE. I like it a lot. I wouldn&#x27;t have necessarily bought it otherwise, but i love the moisturizing especially on my underarms.</li>
    <li> I currently use the Intuition Razor so I am familiar with the Schick brand. I received the Hydrosilk Trimstyle razor as part of a promotion so I gave it a test drive. It provides a pretty close shave but I don&#x27;t really have a use for the trimmer as I generally go Brazilian.  I&#x27;ll probably stick with the Intuition. A good idea for people who do trim though.</li>
    <li> I got this for free from bzzagent, but the review is honest! I really like this razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time using it, my legs were amazingly smooth. The moisturizing strips really lived up to their name. However, the second time, it wasn&#x27;t as smooth. I wouldn&#x27;t pay that much for cartridges if I&#x27;m only going to get an incredible shave once from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it has the bikini trimmer is very convenient. It&#x27;s nice to use when you&#x27;re about to head out the door to the beach to touch up your bikini line!</li>
    <li> Thas razor is great. I love the hydrosilk was already a great razor. Adding the trimmer is just a bonus. Though the razor is a little pricey, it has lots of positives that make it worth the price. I love the guard on the razor, and I love that it runs off regular double a batteries!</li>
    <li> I actually got one of these free to test. I have to say, I was thinking I was going to end up giving it to my sister because I generally hate Schick products and have been a pretty faithful Gillette Venus customer for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving this, I kinda said &amp;#34;WOW.&amp;#34; It was heavy and looked to be of better quality than I expected. The trimmer is adjustable and the pastic cover even comes off if you&#x27;d like a closer trim. It is battery powered and I worried a little about leaving it in the shower. Looking at the cartridge part, I was disappointed. It looked a lot cheaper than the rest of the razor (including the comfy grip) and appeared to have next to nothing as far as the moisture strip.Then I tried it a few days later. The trimmer held up and worked great in the shower. It cut a little shorter than I expected, next time Ill know better. The cartridge surprised me to no end. I got the smoothest shave I have gotten in a long time and the moisture bar lasted through my entire shave and still has more life to it. To be fair, I hadnt shaved in over a month and my hair was relatively long. This thing friggin kicked butt! Im seriously considering tossing my Gillette out the window!</li>
    <li> I was so tired of razor burn and dreaded shaving, but the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor has made a huge difference with my shaving routine!  I love that the electric trimmer can be used in or out of the shower; I can tell that it&#x27;s good quality. Both razors gave me a smooth shave for days!  This was gentle on sensitive skin and overall well worth the money.  I finally have a favorite razor!</li>
    <li> I recently received this product for free to try it out and express my thoughts on it. All these thoughts are my own, not influenced by anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately thought, wow what a small, lightweight and cute little razor! I was a bit skeptical, thinking about how much I&#x27;ve let my hair grow during the winter season. Now that summer is upon us, I need to trim up before I hit the pool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, as I said above, it is small and it is super lightweight. It also is a cute light blue color. Perfect to let my husband know that it is MINE and it is OFF limits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this out, first on my legs. I just used the razor portion. It performed well, about as good as a normal razor that you&#x27;d expect from Schick. My legs were silky smooth by the time I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then went to trim my bikini area. Maybe it&#x27;s just me and I&#x27;ve let the mane grow too long. But the trimmer didn&#x27;t exactly help out. It was kind of hard to use, in fact. I then took the white cap off, that made it a little better. I could tell a small difference, rather than the nothing I experienced with the white head on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the razor is excellent. Like it usually is with Schick. But the trimmer wasn&#x27;t really anything to brag about. The extra head attached was really nothing but a hassle. But it did work well once I took the white part off. I was happy with it. But it could use some adjustments to the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I gave it 3 stars because it&#x27;s a nice razor and the trimmer works OKAY. But if I were to want to buy it, I would need a little more power in the trimmer. (If I could base it on the razor part alone, that would receive a 5/5)</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing! Left my legs feeling soft and smooth. I think they finally came out with a girl version of the guys razor! &#x3D;) Would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Hey ladies( even men), the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle two in one trimmer and razor to me is a great addition to my grooming routine. The first time I used the razor the serum was very smooth on my legs, now remember the serum is transferring from your razor to your legs so it will not last forever. Fortunately, for me I do not suffer from sensitive skin but this razor left my skin soft and smooth. I think the trimmer works good for the bikini area, great way to keep it short. Simply remove the adjustable comb to get close cut. The trimmer is even waterproof!&lt;br /&gt;  I actually received the item from Schick through a bzzcampaign but I would buy this product.</li>
    <li> I got this as a free sample from bzzagent and I loved it!! Leaves skin smooth, silky and bump free! Loved the close shave and the trimmer was the best part for that bikini area! Definitely will recommend!</li>
    <li> Got one of these from BzzAgent for review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BLUF: The trimmer is a wonderful product, esp. for the price. However, I dislike the razor so much I had to write a second review (and drop a star).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second review of this product (my original is below if you&#x27;re super curious). I still love love LOVE the trimmer. It rocks, no kidding. This little trimmer can handle a wet mustache no problems! (Not my mustache, by the way. I convinced a friend to let me experiment on his.) The trimmer is the bomb and if you want a waterproof trimmer the Hydro Schick TrimStyle will meet your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor - I kind of can&#x27;t say enough about this, and not in a good way. It really stinks. I&#x27;ve gotten better shaves from disposable razors out of motel vending machines. The ONLY good thing about it is the built in lubricant. That rocks. So long as your skin is wet you can shave with just the razor; no soap or cream required. The quality of your shave, however, may leave you wanting, well, less. After my shave my legs were proudly sporting stubble and hairs that were totally passed over. Around and behind the knee are all prickly. The area on the shin where the shin bone and the calf muscle meet is impossible to get with this razor. That tiny dip is enough to keep this razor from meeting the skin; even if you turn the razor sideways and try shaving at an angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend tried to shave his face with it and he experienced the same results. There is lots of stubble under his chin and even on his cheeks! The cheek stubble was really surprising because he has full, smooth cheeks that should have been perfect for a close shave. This razor just doesn&#x27;t cut it. (joke option!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short; if you want a trimmer, TrimStyle is for you. It&#x27;s small, portable, easy to use. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a razor; keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see my original review for more detail on the specs and function of the TrimStyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;Alright you lovely people, here&#x27;s the deal: This little trimmer rocks! I&#x27;ll be honest here, I didn&#x27;t try it on myself as I have nothing to trim. Instead I went one better and grabbed a friend who sports a mustache-goatee combo. He kindly stood still while I buzzed his face. We were both very impressed by how smoothly everything went. No snagging, pulling, clogging. It was quick and painless! The trimmer is about 1 inch wide; just perfect for delicate work. The adjustable head does allow for a bit of control over hair length but not a lot. The longest length is around .5 inches (perfect for a mustache goatee.) My friend actually dropped by my house yesterday to borrow the trimmer. It&#x27;s a winner! Now, about the razor. Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t super impressed. It gives a close, smooth shave. The built-in moisturizer is beyond awesome! If you&#x27;ve ever used fresh aloe (the slimy insides of the actual leaf) then you know what the moisturizer strip feels like. I was actually able to shave using only the lubricant provided by the razor head. It&#x27;s really nice. The caveat is that you can only use it on your legs (and even then it&#x27;s hit-or-miss behind the knees). Forget working on your bikini area with that enormous razor head. And don&#x27;t expect a smooth finish under your arms. The 5 blades are a boon. The plastic monstrosity that encases them is not. The razor head is so large that you simply cannot get into any areas where your skin creases. Now I know this is getting picky, but the packaging on this thing is not very well done. It comes in a standard cardboard box with clear plastic inserts. However, to get the razor out you have to rip the box open. Neither the top nor the bottom opens easily. All of the sides have been glued down. This is not a terrible thing except that the instructions have been printed on theinside of the box and can be (were) easily torn. Please, Schick, add an access point! The other issue that I have is the lack of a cleaning brush. The trimmer head disassembles very nicely and is completely waterproof. Hairs, on the other hand, tend to stick when they get wet meaning that running the trimmer under water does not actually get it clean. I had to use an old tooth brush to remove the excess hair. It&#x27;s a $15 product (plus or minus) but adding a $.20 brush should be do able. Personally, I&#x27;m not keen on needing 2 separate razors to get the job done. I will continue using my current razor which works for legs, bikini, and under arms. The trimmer is excellent and will likely be moving into its new home as a stache-trimmer ;) If you are looking for a good multi-purpose tool the Hydro Silk TrimStyle is close, but not quite there yet.&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the razor.

    <li> Thanks to bzzagent I tried this product for free and honestly I love it, it doesn&#x27;t leave me with red bumps and It lower the times a cut myself with regular shavers...also I love the part were it leaves my skin so soft....also I love the trimmer for those difficult areas...loving the product so much that I&#x27;m gonna keep using it from know on</li>
    <li> I had received a  Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle to try for free from BzzAgent. When I first opened it I was surprised since it is bulkier and heavier than any other razor I&#x27;ve ever used. the bikini trimmer and razor that vibrates if you hold down a button DEFINITELY took some getting used too. The second time I used it was much better than the first. The razor is good, I prefer to use it without the vibrations and the moisture strips surrounding the blades are pretty nice, but I&#x27;ve had more moisturizing razors. I still use it with shaving cream. This razor leaves my legs silky smooth without razor burn which is super nice and I can go 3-4 days between shaves.The bikini trimmer end is definitely something new, but AWESOME. Its adjustable so you can determine how long you want to leave the hair and the guard prevents any fear of getting any nicks or razor burn. The bikini trimmer is definitely the selling point of this razor and the best part if you ask me. I got some coupons from BzzAgent and will definitely be buying more of these babies. Definitely excited for summer bikini season to start! :)</li>
    <li> I love this razor! Plus its two and one so that is a huge plus! The packaging is easy to open, which is a major bonus (you know those packages where you have to run a saw through them to open and then slice your hand open trying to get the item out? its not one of those!). The razor itself is great, it leaves my skin super smooth and hydrated, with no razor burn. I also love having the trimmer with it as well too, even if I am still figuring out how to use it properly. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it says anything about this razor: my boyfriend saw it and made me go buy him one because it was something he was looking for as well too.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free from BzzAgent and was really impressed by the high quality features this razor had. Schick really thought of everything! From the built in bikini trimmer to the water activated moisturizer strip, this razor had it</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical at first &amp;#34;why would I need a fancy razor to shave my bikini and legs? Why would anyone need this type of razor on their body?&amp;#34; but regardless of my reservations, I gave it a try. This razor is amazing, one side is a traditional razor and the other side is for the bikini area. The razor side moisturizes very well, you almost don&#x27;t need any shaving cream. And the bikini side was very easy to use and trim. Neither side left me with irritation and shaved very smoothly. I doubt I will be able to go back to a regular razor after this.</li>
    <li> I just got this new NEW Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® Razor  through BzzzAgent and i&#x27;m happy. I love it. First of all i usually wax my bikini zone, but my armpits and my legs are different story. I use Gillette Venus for almost 2 years now only for my legs and armpits. Every time while shaving i cut myself, every single time. So i used new Schick 2 times already, started with my legs - - no cuts. I didn&#x27;t cut myself at all :) When i was shaving my armpits i couldn&#x27;t feel razor at all. I loved it. the best experience ever. OK. Now the best part : TRIMMER. My boyfriend used my NEW Schick Hydro Silk® Trimmer on his body. He was happy like a child. lol. Anyway i would recommend this razor to any girl. I&#x27;m sure you would be pleasantly surprised with NEW Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® Razor</li>
    <li> I liked this razor but felt is was a little to bulky making it hard for me to get a good handle on it. The best feature of this razor and the only reason I would buy it again is for the bikini line trimmer. It cuts close but doesn&#x27;t nick my skin, which typically all razors do. I wouldn&#x27;t say it was the best razor out there but it is close to it. Though I just got it and am waiting to see how long the actual razor will last. If it last for a while I will buy it and recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I was excited when i received this razor at no cost from Bzzagent.com. I really wanted to love this razor and thought it would be phenomenal since I often travel.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of travel, this razor really is not travel-friendly. It does not come with a guard so you have to put the razor in a bag/container before you pack it in another bag or container.  The lack of blade guard is also an issue since that&#x27;s the end you hold onto when the trimmer is in use. One slip could definitely spell disaster-ouch!&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical of a trimmer powered by a AA battery, although I was impressed it came with a higher quality one. I tried the trimmer several times for good measure and had the same results each time. It pulled hair (and drew blood on one occasion). I also noticed it really didn&#x27;t seem to trim uniformly with or without the adjustable comb (which I did think was a nice touch).&lt;br /&gt;I am completely in love with the little kickstand that the razor has! I wish all razors were equipped with it as it keeps the razor from sitting in a pool of water in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;The five blades were a nice touch. Between the moisture serum in the razor and the five blades, it almost seems like you&#x27;re not shaving at all! I was surprised to get as close of a shave as I did since the blades seem to be set quite far in the actual head of the razor!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this product might work for some, but just really didn&#x27;t for me.  I will continue to use the razor and maybe the trimmer only in a pinch, but at the price of between $16-$35 for one replaceable razor head and battery operated trimmer, I think I will stick to the trimmer I already have and maybe explore some of the other Hydrosilk products.</li>
    <li> I love the razor aspect of it. Very smooth shave. The trimmer part I  pretty weak. I love the fact that it comes with a battery, that always helps.  (I got this as a part of a review)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this razor. I received it free from BzzAgent to test and review. I always used to borrow my husband&#x27;s trimmer but now, I don&#x27;t have to! I love having everything all in one and the five blades provide a really silky smooth shave. The only downside to this razor? There is no cover for the shaving blades. Otherwise, it&#x27;s the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I am 6 months pregnant and, as a result, many of my beauty routines have changed dramatically. Shaving is the routine that was affected the most. The problem is that, as my belly grows, it gets increasingly difficult to bend over. Shaving my legs is difficult enough. Shaving my bikini line is something so difficult that I was ready to give it up for the next three months. Begrudgingly too, because being pregnant over the summer almost requires outdoor water activities for survival. Then I discovered the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor. It doubles as both a regular razor and an electric bikini trimmer. I now find that I can safely trim my bikini line without worrying about my giant belly getting in the way. It doesn&#x27;t matter how clumsily I do it. I can use the trimmer safely enough without even having to see over my belly. It&#x27;s a miracle! On top of that, the razor does an excellent job of shaving my legs. The blades are so high quality, and with the combination of skin guards and the moisturizing serum, I don&#x27;t have to worry about nicking myself while shaving. I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my legs felt after using this razor. The best part is that I got it for free through BzzAgent.com! But, if I hadn&#x27;t, I would have bought. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer for free to review from BzzAgent and Schick, and this is a godsend!!! I can&#x27;t believe the close shave I get and without worry of cutting myself! If only I had found this sooner... I recommend this product to get silky smooth for summer swimming.</li>
    <li> I received this razor to try for free and I am very glad that I was picked!! This razor works well as a bikini trimmer and as a regular razor.  It is also nice that it is all combined in one tool so it keeps my shower less cluttered.  I think the blades used are also very good! They keep my legs smooth and seem to last a while without getting too dull which is a big plus for me since I usually procrastinate buying blades.  I was also glade to try this as I had blades for the Schick Hydro already that I bought by accident and have been awkwardly trying to fit them on my other Schick razor.  I like the color of this razor also and it has a nice feel when holding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the only things I don&#x27;t like is that the different trimmer settings all seem to be the same except for completely taking the plastic part off and using the blade. This isn&#x27;t a big problem but I feel like the other blade settings do nothing which was kind of a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a really great razor and I am happy to have it at my disposal.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty awesome razor. Comes in a neat and attractive package. I received it as a free product to review and I am glad I tried it.  I have been using it every other day and it has left me with a very nice close shave. I don&#x27;t have much use for the TrimStyle part so I just leave it alone. I tried it and it didn&#x27;t give me as much of a close shave as I&#x27;d like. Overall it&#x27;s a great razor and didn&#x27;t leave me with razor burn afterwards but I did use it with shaving cream. The moisturizing strip only lasted 3 days and was very oozy I think it congested the blades more than help my skin but once it was all off it really didn&#x27;t make a difference. I will definitely be purchasing more refill blades though because I&#x27;m loving the close shave it gives me especially in my bikini area.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I was lucky enough to get to try this product for free as a bzzagent. This product has  A clever design this handy all in one tool eliminates the need for multiple clippers/cutters/scissors when it&#x27;s Time to trim up for summer. I had no trouble using this product, and no problems after. The trimmer left my hairs just the right length for the razor to easily shave them away with no pulling or tugging. And my skin had no irritation afterward, in fact the gel strips left my bikini area feeling silky soft. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to cut down on the amount of trimming tools they have in their bathroom.</li>
    <li> I used to use Bic Soleil or Venus Embrace razors and this Schick beats those by a landslide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little trimmer is quite cool--definitely has made for easier shaving and less ingrown hair. You load a battery and press the button and it activates, no need to hold down the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The razor itself is great--I&#x27;ve had minimal irritation and razor bumps after using it, and normally my irritation is pretty extreme. The lotion &amp;#34;activates&amp;#34; when you submerge the razor in water. After 10 uses or so I can still feel a bit of the lotion, which is nice! Schick recommends you use this razor with Skintimate shave cream. I agree; I tried it with Aveeno and it seemed to clog up the razor a little more.</li>
    <li> I recieved this as a sample from the brand and this works very well! No bumps or razor burns.</li>
    <li> I usually have the worst trouble with razor burn, even using shaving cream, but I didn&#x27;t have any after using this razor. I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use the shaver yet, but the razor was much easier to use that I thought it would be and was not as heavy as it looked like it would be with its size. All-in-all, I was very happy with this razor and would definitely recommend it for anyone with razor burn issues such as myself.  I recieved this product for free through a Bzz Agent campaign.</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a free trial from Bzzagent as a promotion for the brand and I was so excited!!&lt;br /&gt;I really like the trimmer feature of this razor. It&#x27;s awesome how its attached to the razor - really convenient! The shape of the device is easy to hold and use.  Also, my package came with a battery which was definitely a plus.  The razor has a moisture strip. Its good but not the best moisture strip I&#x27;ve ever used.  I would overall recommend this razor. Schick is a good brand and this is a good, lasting product,</li>
    <li> I got to try this item for free through bzz agent. Overall, i think it is an ok tool. I personally do not do the bakini thing, so i let my husband test it out in his beard. He had a fun time and said it was very convenient because it is small and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself left my legs smooth and shiny. I would recommend to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have never used a trimmer before and I got to say, I don&#x27;t know why I never did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to say that I did receive this through BzzAgent but I would definitely repurchase when the time comes for a replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this razor is big compared to the average razor. I mean, it makes sense since it has to hold a battery for the electric trimmer part. However, this is absolutely not a hindrance when using it because it actually allows for a good grip which I very much prefer over other razor grips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor was nice and pleasant -- it got the job done. I honestly didn&#x27;t really care much for its &amp;#34;Hydrosilky&amp;#34; claims because it was the same as any other premium razors you find in the drugstore. I would definitely continue using this razor over others because it didn&#x27;t give me that prickly feeling that I often get after I shave my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so the trimmer part is a bit hard to use if you had never used one before. It took quite some time getting used to. Be very careful with this! There are 4 settings depending on your preference for hair length. You adjust to the different settings by lowering the casing or entirely taking it off. I use mine with the casing on as it really helps with not coming in direct contact with skin yet is super effective. Just make sure to continuously clean it out after use as I suspect that a build up can occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably would have bought this product just for the trimmer part but am very happy to have received a bonus razor on the other edge! Very useful and efficient! I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> This maybe the closest shave I have ever achieved. This device is not only water proof, so you have comfort and privacy to shave, but it is small and light weight for an easier traveling situtation. I have very sensitive skin and the razor does a great job with a smooth moisturizing shave leaving my skin with a glow, its just the best find of the year.</li>
    <li> This razor is worth every penny! It got such a great close shave and my legs couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I got it for free through bzzagent but it is so worth the price!</li>
    <li> Thanks to Schick and BzzAgent, I got this for free and I could not be happier with it. It gave a close shave and plenty of moisture that lasts for a good while, even out of the shower. I like the water activated moisture system, it is creative and lasts for several shaves, rather than a few in regular moisture bars on other brands of razors. The idea of adding clippers for the bikini area is very new and creative and does indeed do a good job, saves some time, plus it&#x27;s adjustable! It comes with a single AAA battery so you can use it right away&lt;br /&gt;  For those that care about packaging and the environment, there is no wasted paper coming from this, the instructions are printed right on the inside of the box.&lt;br /&gt;  All in all, once this one has met the end of its days, I will most likely be buying another due to its comfort and convenience. Thank you Schick!</li>
    <li> I got mine thanks to Buzzagent for free. I really liked this razor! It got real close and felt great in my hands as well as my legs.! But the price I&#x27;m not so sure everyone can afford. This is not a cheap razor.</li>
    <li> I very was excited when I got to try the Schick Hydro Silk Trim Style! When I say that this product worked very well, it worked!!! I am in love with this razor. My legs have been so smooth for the past week. My hair usually grows back 3 or 4 days after I shave but with this razor, it has literally taken a week for m hair to start growing back!!! I would totally recommend this product to friends and family!!!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this item</li>
    <li> I got this razor free from Bzzagent to try and was so excited! This razor had so much potential and I loved it at first but my love didn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Nice handle, easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;-Convenient stand to keep razor edge up&lt;br /&gt;-Battery operated- optional&lt;br /&gt;- 2 in 1!&lt;br /&gt;-Close shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Moisture strip fell off within a week and got goopy&lt;br /&gt;-Bikini area trimmer is inconsistent&lt;br /&gt;-Not as smooth without the moisture strip</li>
    <li> I tried this product for free, compliments to Schick. I was very impressed overall, I was satisfied with the effectiveness of the razor head and very pleased with the results of the trimmer. When I used the razor in addition to shaving gel, it made my skin very slick and it was somewhat difficult to hold the razor. After washing it off though, my skin felt like silk and I didn&#x27;t even feel like using lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer was intimidating at first but I decided to test it through trial and error. I did not use the adjustable length because it didn&#x27;t seem to do very much trimming, but when I removed the adjuster it shaved everything down neatly. I think it trimmed well, leaving about 1/4 to 1/2 inch and I was comfortable with that. For a first timer using a trimmer, I think this is fairly easy to use, but be cautious if you have shaky hands when nervous. Hair builds up fast behind the trimmer head, which is easy to get to with a little pressure around the blade. The power button is convenient for continuous trimming, it does get stuck if you push it hard too many times but I haven&#x27;t broken it yet. The padding on the handle also makes it easier to hold for a safer, more confident shave wherever it&#x27;s needed.</li>
    <li> I would like to first start out my review noting that I have been using Schick razors for a few years now. Prior to BzzAgent sending me the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor to try for free, I was using a Shick Hydro 5. I have been quite satisfied with my Hydro 5, as it allows for me to achieve a closer shave and the blades do not dull quickly. So, when asked by BzzAgent to test drive the *new* Shick Hydro Silk TrimStyle, I happily obliged. Though given a free sample of the product to test, I am providing my honest-to-goodness opinion of the product below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about the razor that it was much bulkier in comparison to my Hydro 5. Initially, this concerned me as I was not sure I&#x27;d be able to grip the razor while shaving during my morning/evening shower routines. Upon first go at shaving with the Hydro Silk TrimStyle, this concern diminished, as I found the razor suprisingly easy to grip and maintain consistent, steady control over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor boasts &amp;#34;five Curve Sensing® blades to provide incredible closeness while reducing skin irritation,&amp;#34; which I was especially interested in putting to the test because I have extremely sensitive skin. Like my Hydro 5, the five blade system of the Hydro Silk TrimStyle helps me to obtain a close shave. However, because I have extremely sensitive skin, I did obtain a few knicks the first time around. For me, this is normal. The &amp;#34;water-activated hypoallergenic moisturizing serum&amp;#34; on the razor allowed for the head of the razor to glide smoothly on my skin. I am usually concerned about irritation, but did not experience any irritation related to using this razor. The only irritation I experienced, was due to the Skintimate Shaving Cream used when shaving. Shaving creams and gels are hit or miss with me. Sometimes they cause irritation and itching after shaving, and sometimes they do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unique feature -- waterproof bikini trimmer -- truly can be used in and out of the shower. It has four adjustable comb settings, which allows for the user to choose desired closeness of trim. To turn on the trimmer, you&#x27;re supposed to press the button on the razor handle. The button was a bit difficult to turn on/off, but not terribly difficult or inconvenient. I did not experience any irritation or nicks from using the trimmer on the first go around, so I feel comfortable in making the assertion that it does not have a steep learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only potential issues I found with using the Hydro Silk TrimStyle is that it is battery-operated, which may be difficult for some people to remember to maintain. I am also not certain how long the trimmer would last on such a razor. But, it is important to keep in mind that this is a battery operated, cost-effective razor. For the price, which averages around less than $15 (online), versatility in functions, and quality of shave, you will not likely find a comparable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while I do not use the Hydro Silk TrimStyle everyday, I do continue to use it weekly, along with my Hydro 5. I love both razors, but the Hydro Silk TrimStyle has the capacity to maintain and manicure those delicate areas of the body more efficiently.Thus, I highly recommend this razor.the shower.

    <li> I was sent this item by bzzagent.com to use and review and my experience with this razor is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 times I used this razor, and 5 times I was left with under-arm bumps and a decent shave as the end result. Though on the one hand the bumps cannot be fully blamed on the razor alone, I must say that my Intuition razor (by the same brand) gave me a great, close, comfortable shave and I&#x27;ve almost never suffered the consequences afterward. Then there&#x27;s also the problem of the cartridges needing to be replaced in a blink, as I only used mine 3 times before the first cartridge needed changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bikini trimmer on the other hand, is a different story. Whoever came up with the idea is a genius. Such a simple, yet effective tool that&#x27;s made it a million times easier on me to hop in the shower and shave down there in record time. It works quite well and whatever your preferred look for your bikini area, the trimmer does it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the razor gets a 3/5 from me, because while the bikini area trimmer is amazing and makes it almost fun to shave, the opposite razor edge is just your every-day-quality razor with nothing special that makes it worth buying over the others. The general consensus on this thing is that it&#x27;s convenient and most everyone is positively in love with the trimmer. So if you&#x27;re willing to settle for a mediocre razor to get the the REAL prize (i.e. the trimmer), then you&#x27;re in luck with Schick Hydro&#x27;s Silk TrimStyle Razor.</li>
    <li> I received this for free for a BzzAgent campaign. I was a little disappointed in this razor. First thing is, the handle is MASSIVE! It&#x27;s way too bulky for my liking since it has to hold a battery, but that was to be expected. I knew before I even got it to expect that. Secondly, I only shaved my full legs once with this razor after having only done it 2 days before and needed to change the cartridge!!! These cartridges are not cheap either! Third thing is that I didn&#x27;t not feel like I was getting a close enough shave with this razor. I needed to do a once over with my regular razor once I was done to get it close enough for my liking. The only part I actually did like was the bikini trimmer. That works well. I like that there is different length settings and that it&#x27;s very gentle on my sensitive skin. Beyond that I think there is just too much focus on bells and whistles and not enough focus on what matters most: a good close shave.</li>
    <li> I got this Schick TrimStyle Razor from BzzAgent. I have never used an electric razor before, so I was nervous to use it and it took me a couple tries to figure it out. The bikini trimmer works for me the best if I use it on the closest setting.  On the highest setting, it didn&#x27;t do anything. The trimmer head is small so it makes it easier to shave in the bikini area. The hair removed pretty easily, with a few times that it pulled. The biggest problem with this trimmer is that it&#x27;s time consuming. It seems easier just to use a regular razor to shave. The end result looked fairly neat and trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked that the razor is on the opposite end so that I could quickly shave my legs afterwards. With the razor, it gives a close shave and leaves my legs soft, but I did get a few nicks within the last 5 or 6 times I&#x27;ve used it. I also have gotten razor burn a little bit on my legs. Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t buy the Trimstyle razor for myself since I prefer the Schick Quattro Razor for Women instead.</li>
    <li> I use razors on a daily basis, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve used a trimmer prior to receiving this product. I got it free from BzzAgent as a trial product through Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is the portion &#x27;you never knew you needed.&#x27; The razor portion works okay. However, I&#x27;ve been using a 5-blade men&#x27;s razor made by the same company (Schick) that works much better. So, the razor isn&#x27;t the hallmark of this product - but the trimmer is very handy. When things get a little overgrown, the trimmer can get things &#x27;under control&#x27; and then the razor can come after the trimmer, easily removing the remaining hair. It&#x27;s a 2-step program for successful hair removal. It might&#x27;ve been a long winter, but no one at the beach in the spring needs to know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I now use waxing for my hair removal needs, but I still use Schick razors for my legs and I use the trimmer before waxing if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll find a use for this product. And if you&#x27;re embarrassed to purchase it in person, order it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing! It&#x27;s waterproof, it&#x27;s got the adjustable trimmer, it&#x27;s silky and it gives the closest shave and smoothest legs!! I am a BzzAgent and I recieved the razor free for trying and reviewing. I love it and would definitely buy another and use them again!!</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro silk trimstyle is one of the best razor I ever tried . The razor works really well on your arms &amp;legs while the trimmer works well on the bikini area . overall I give this product 5 stars. I didn&#x27;t buy this product from Amazon . It was a gift from Bzz Agent .</li>
    <li> I was fortunate to be able to receive this razor to review from Schick and BzzAgent. I enjoy using the Schick Hydro Silk products and this one is no different. It gives a close amazing shave and with the moisture strips, I don&#x27;t even need to use shaving cream. I took off one star because I think that the bikini razor does not give as close of a shave as I would like. It gets close, but it could be better.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE the shaver! This shaver is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten and i LOVE Schick as well which made my experience even better. As for the electric razor i&#x27;m not so sure on.  You do have to push down the start button on the razor really hard for it to click on and stay on. As for the two settings of length you can have the electric razor on i didn&#x27;t like either length really. The razor has a guard on it and that&#x27;s for extra long hair; then when you take off the guard the razor is too short. It felt like it cut me twice and then i gave up on it. So the only real use is from the shaver itself. Either way i love the shaver so thank you for letting me try it out free Schick!</li>
    <li> I received mine from bzzagent and have been so happy! I have been using it for a few weeks and I don&#x27;t think I will ever stop using it! This razor has been amazing especially after a week of Mother Nature. I will recommend it to anyone who asks! No more porcupine legs for me.</li>
    <li> Great shave for the unmentionables</li>
    <li> I received this for free from BzzAgent and was excited to try it. When I used the trimmer I couldn&#x27;t get any hair off, so I ended up taking the guard off and used the trimmer without the guard and still no hair came off.  The razor side works fine, also nothing special for it being 5 blades.. But I like the stand of the razor.</li>
    <li> I received this razor in my Bzz kit. I really love the idea of a trimmer on the razor. It makes things so much easier and quicker. The trimmer is great, it has 4 different length settings and is easy to use in or out of the shower. It does a great job. I ended up with a cut on my leg from the razor side, but I did end up with a nice clean shave. I had a bit of razor burn the next day (I didn&#x27;t use shave gel). I am glad shick has come out with a product like this, and I will continue to use this razor!</li>
    <li> I got this free to try out from BzzAgent...this is ama-za-zing! I used a regular razor for years. Took a while in the shower, I didnt bother for fancy trimmers when I can do it myself...THE HARD WAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cut my time in more than half. It left me with no bumps or irritation (which I normally am left with) and I got all the hard to reach hairs. I loved the adjustable trimmer and how easy it is to adjust it. This may look a big bulky, but it feels like high quality. Gives you control and doesnt slipp from your hands. The head of the razor bends to get the hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my legs too...no need for shaving cream, this moisturizes you so good. I indeed was missing out on alot before trying this. It is so worth it and I have found an item to add to my top 5 list of things I need for bikini season.</li>
    <li> I am so happy Schick came out with this product. I was not so sure this would be a product for me when I got it. But am happy to say I Love It!!! It keeps my skin feeling moisturized, I have less razor burn and I never feel like I&#x27;m going to drop it. I am so happy this gives a close shave. What else is great, is that having the 2 in one helps getting ready quicker then normal. This is definitely a product I&#x27;m going to continue using this summer. I received my free Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® razor through BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I received this razor to try through bzz agent. I was so excited to try this product! I wanted to love it. It kind of kills me that I don&#x27;t love it, but it let me down. The trimmer is a cool feauture although it does make the razor bulky and heavy to hold. However, it&#x27;s the razor that let me down. I&#x27;m HATE stubble on my legs. It&#x27;s seriously one of the worst feelings. I&#x27;ve been using a 3 blade razor for years and have been pleased with the results. So when I received the trimstyle with 5 blades, I couldn&#x27;t wait. However, I was disappointed. The razor has moisture ribbons which is cool, but when I used it I felt like the moisture strip got in the way of the razor blades. They got gooey, and I would have to keep stopping to rinse the blades. Needless to say, I didn&#x27;t get a shave as close as I liked, and by the next day I had more stubble than I did when using my 3 blade razor. I believe in the Schick brand, but this isn&#x27;t my favorite product. Although with some tweaking, it might be!</li>
    <li> Loved Loved this TrimStyle razor. Ready to use right out the package and see wonderful results. My husband even got amazed as to how convenient it was to have the trimmer on one end and the razor on the other. The moistorizer on the razor is great. This is my new obsession.</li>
    <li> I received this as a free promotion from Schick through BzzAgent and this review is of my own opinion and not a paid review. From start to finish: the packaging was easy to open and I love that the battery is included. The instructions were printed on the inside of the package which I wasn&#x27;t fond of because I had to keep the package instead of a small folded paper but I guess that&#x27;s useful if you don&#x27;t want to lose it. Also, I felt the instructions could have been a little more detailed as it took some tugging and twisting before I figured out how to clean the trimmer. I didn&#x27;t find the bikini trimmer function useful since the shortest it will trim the hair is as long as I will grow it. I have mixed feeling about the bladed side of this razor. As for leg shaving, it was a disaster. The moisturizing strip was goopy and I had to rinse my legs constantly for the razor to get the hairs through the slimey mess. My shins were impossible to get (I have no meat there so it&#x27;s just bone) and ended up switching to my regular razor for that. BUT using that end on the bikini area was AMAZING. I always get bumps the day after and I have lots of hairs that have been pulled by whatever razor I use that cause bleeding. But this razor is the first ever to work properly. The gel situation meant I still had to rinse often, but since it&#x27;s no where near the size of a leg, it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal. And since I have never shaved without pain, cuts, and irritation, this razor is worth it for that alone. I&#x27;ll still be buying a different razor for my legs but this razor will be right beside it in my shower from now on. One more thing that would have been a major improvement is if there was a cap to cover the blades like most razors have because I was nicked when it fell off the side of the tub during a shower.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best razor I&#x27;ve EVER owned!!</li>
    <li> So, this might sound gross but when I found out I would be receiving this campaign as a bzz agent  I intentialy let my hair grow out just so I could see what all the buzz is about. That being said, I think I&#x27;ve found my new go to razor and trimmer. Not only did I get a super close shave, I also felt silky smooth afterwards! My husband couldn&#x27;t keep his hands off of me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on a more serious note the razor itself shaves nice and close, leaving my legs feel smooth and moisturized. And as far as the trimmer goes, I love having the option of four adjustable trim settings. My favorite was taking the case off and getting that super close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I feel smooth and ready to bare all!</li>
    <li> I have been using older versions of the Schick trimstyle razors and been very happy with them since 2008, so I was excited to try a free promotional version. I love the bikini trimmer option to keep things neat and do maintenance without having to worry about shaving and getting razor bumps and burn down there.  I find this new version has all the things I like about the older version,  easy to hold and maneuver (although the new version is slightly larger) and not too big to get into hard to reach places.  The button that activates the trimmer seems easier to work than older verions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I&#x27;m less than pleased with the blades. At first, I liked the moisturizing strips that self expel and the fact that there are 5 blades. Now, having used the razor for a month or two, I find  I&#x27;m getting razor burn on areas of my legs that have never gotten it before (even after changing blades). I&#x27;ve also been nicking myself around my ankle bones much more than I usually do. The moisturizing strips kind of ooze and leave a weird strings  of &amp;#34;drool&amp;#34; when you lift the razor from your legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the razor itself and will keep using it, but I think I will switch back to my old schick Quattro blades and see if that clears up the razor burn problem.</li>
    <li> I love the TrimStyle razor! It&#x27;s totally made my shaving routine easier and I love that I can use both the disposable and trimmer all in the shower! I can get a close shave on my legs and use the trimmer on the lowest comb length to get a close trim where it&#x27;s needed! Totally beach ready as soon as the weather allows. I love that it&#x27;s totally waterproof and my legs are super soft and moisturized all in one! I received this razor as part of a promotion for the brand and am so glad they introduced me to it!!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE this razor. I got to try it for free thanks to BuzzAgent &amp; Schick. The size of the razor makes it really easy to handle. And the size of the razor head covers so much area! I did not have to go back over spots as many times. The trimmer was amazing! I usually use scissors to trim hair &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; lol. It was wonderful to have a trimmer I can use in the shower! I will buy this razor again!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care much for this razor. Too big and clunky and the trimmer isn&#x27;t very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I received this free as part of a BzzAgent Kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a fabulous razor/trimmer. It leaves my skin feeling silky with no razor burn or rash.&lt;br /&gt; The trimmer end is easy to use and comes with a removable piece so you can choose how close you want to shave.</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro Silk are my favorite razors for keeping my skin smooth and not irritated for frequent shaving. I really like the moisturizing strips- they are essential to preventing ingrown hairs. The trimmer is just okay- I think it could use a little bit of Oomph and the comb is basically useless. #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I received this free product from BzzAgent to test. All opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle in the shower and have been using it for three weeks. I have fairly sensitive skin and usually have razor burn after I shave, but when I used this product I was surprised that it left no razor burn. The razor glides across my legs and leaves them moisturized. I like that it&#x27;s quick,easy to use, and that I don&#x27;t have waste time trying to soothe razor bumps after I shave. Overall I think this razor is great because I can skip the extra steps of having to put on shaving gel and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Closest shave I have ever gotten with a razor! I have sensitive skin and the gel strips are incredibly moisturizing, not irritating to my skin at all (so moisturizing, in fact, that you can even use the razor without having to lather up with soap!). The detachable head of the bikini trimmer part is great for cleaning out the blades and the three settings allows you to customize how close of a shave you want. I sometimes accidentally press the button while shaving so this is my only negative, but it is seriously outweighed by all the positives. Great product! and great that it&#x27;s waterproof!</li>
    <li> Was able to sample this through bzzagent. But OHMYGOODNESS, I will be buying replacements for this razor. It left my legs feeling super smooth and moisturized. The electric trimmer end made getting into tight areas super easy and fast.</li>
    <li> Okay i LITERALLY buy a different brand and styled razor EVERY other week.. I have never been able to make my mind up about which one i like, or which one fits into my budget. UNIT NOW!!! I am soooo excited to share with you anout the new TrimStyle bikini shaver! First off i can shave my armpits, and legs with one side and the other side is battery operated with several different length options for trimming your delicate areas ladies! (And gents if you want) It was sooo easy and hassle free. I have been wanting to write a review since the first time i tried it but i wanted to wait to do it the following week to make sure it wasnt &amp;#34;too good to be true&amp;#34; and guess what.. it was still amazing!! Thank you BzzAgent for sending me this trial, i am not 100% hooked and cannot wait to spread this goodness around more!!!! Sincerely, one happy shaver! :)</li>
    <li> I got this product free to try. I really like this product except that after 2 weeks the razor blades started turning rusty that&#x27;s a huge no no for me. that will make me change the razor blades a lot. other than that I like every thing else, so if you don&#x27;t mind changing the blades go ahead and buy it. I will just be using the trimmer only.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! It is perfect for me because I tend to have sensitive skin and this razor doesn&#x27;t give my skin any irritation! I love how the bikini trimmer is waterproof, so I can use it in the shower. I received this razor as part of a free trial and loved it so much. I also gave out the coupons it came with to friends and family.</li>
    <li> This razor/trimmer is the best one I have ever used. It has a nice thick handle with a good grip and also comes with a battery. The razor side glides very nicely and the trimmer side is more powerful then some other trimmers I have used in the past. I would suggest this razor/trimmer for anyone looking for a 2 in 1, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I tried this as a promotion and waited a month to see if it held up.  It did.  I love that I can use it fully submerged in the bath and the Shaver has had no problems with the battery submerged.  I love how you can adjust the trim size and that really helps keep things manageable.  The head of the razor has 4 blades and is very comfortable.  My skin is super soft afterwards.  I got really lucky with this promotion and plan to keep buying replacement heads as the need  arises.  I&#x27;m really happy with this razor - I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> i like it a lot it is waterproof and light it is easy to use the trimmer  is adjustable and you can replace the parts</li>
    <li> This is my first Schick product I have ever used as well as my first non-disposable razor ever used (I&#x27;ve received a free sample through BzzAgent). I also have coarse hair on my legs and underarms so I was not sure what to expect with this produce. I was impressed at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The appearance of the razor was nice. It felt comfortable in my hand. The button for the trimmer was well-placed on the handle so it wasn&#x27;t accidentally turned on/off when using it. The trimmer part of the razor comes with a plastic comb that has three levels and can even be taken off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the razor exactly how the directions said to: Use with a Skintimate shave gel. I use Skintimate already and had some on-hand. The razor was great! I tried a few spots on my leg without the shaving gel and the serum spots from the razor worked well. The razor glides smoothly with no nicks or cuts. I&#x27;ve used this razor with the same head three times now and only got a small cut on this third time - which is nothing in comparison to how often I&#x27;d get cuts from my non-disposables. The serum also worked all three times. I&#x27;ve had to shave just as many times with this product as with disposables, which I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little less impressed with the bikini trimmer. I have never used a trimmer before so I was relying on the instructions that were included with the product. The instructions were very vague so I just went for it. My hair was short around the bikini area. I played around with the trimmer levels/took off the comb and nothing worked. After a few minutes of struggling, I gave up. The next time I tried using the trimmer, I let the hair by my bikini area grow out a tiny bit more and used the trimmer without the comb and it worked. The trimmer was a little rough on my skin and did an okay job. It&#x27;s good to have just in case but I wouldn&#x27;t rely on using the trimmer every time. The razor worked by my bikini area just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was very satisfied with this product. The only real con of it is the price for the replacement razor heads. Try this product out for yourself!the price for the replacement razor heads. Try this product out for yourself!</li>
    <li> I love this. Doesn&#x27;t hurt or cause razorburn. Waterproof is a plus</li>
    <li> This is the most fantastic razor I have EVER used!  I was sent this razor via BuzzAgent as part of a promotion from Schick at no cost and I am never using any other razor again.  I have never shaved so fast and my legs have never felt this soft and smooth FOR DAYS with any other razor!  And the bikini trimmer is amazing!  The trimmer head is adjustable and easy to clean, and it has made trimming and shaving so much easier! Also, it has a thicker handle to it with a really comfortable grip, which made it even easier and more comfortable to use!  I HIGHLY recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free through bzzagent. All opinions are still my own and completely honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to get to try the TrimStyle Razor. I even did a countdown to the start of the campaign. When it arrived I open it up right away. The first thing I noticed was that there was no blade guard for the actual razor. Razors are sharp and need to be covered I really hope that fix this and include one because it doesn&#x27;t come with a storage place for the razor either. I thought the design was cute, it did feel a little bulky when you held it, but that is to be expected with dual razor trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that they included in the starter kit a battery. I don&#x27;t know about other moms, but this one always forgets to buy the battery for anything and then I end up having to make a special trip to the store to get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the razor, it left my legs really smooth. After using it one time though, the conditioning strip kind of started oozing out a little too much and so every time after the first globs of it would come off while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the trimmer much at all. I&#x27;m not sure if mine was a defected one or if it was meant to work this way. I would have to hold the button at the same time I was trying to use it. The button would just stay in on position without being held down and It felt super awkward to hold it while pushing the button. I felt like I was going to end up cutting myself so I just opted not to use it after the first time I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I probably would not purchase this razor trimmer after being able to try it free. I would​ get just this type of razor without the trimmer though.</li>
    <li> I really like my TrimStyle. The razor is great and the trimmer is very handy.  The power button and the size are a little awkward. Sometimes the power button doesn&#x27;t work and sometimes it does but, it always comes on. I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free through bzzagent to try it out and give my honest opinion. Here it is..... The razor is great. It really is. I don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time going over and over the same areas to get it smooth, it gets it the first time. Another great plus is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin to the point it feels like my skin was ripped apart, my legs stay soft for hours afterwards. The trimmer gets everything neatly trimmed so that everything is all tidy, especially for the summer. My only downfall is the button, it seems kinda hard to push to get it to stay off or on. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product that I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I received a Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor and bikini trimmer from BzzAgent free of charge as part of a promotion from the brand. After trying out the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle for a few weeks, I have found things I both like and dislike about it. I like that the razor end gives you the close shave you expect from a Schick Hydro Silk razor and the handle is easy and comfortable to hold and maneuver. What I don&#x27;t like about it is that the thickness of the base of the razor end makes it difficult to rinse off the shaving cream that builds up there. The bikini trimming end was essentially useless to me. I tried using the trimmer both in and out of the shower and I never achieved an even trimming result. Also, the trimmer irritated my skin. I eventually abandoned use of the trimmer side and exclusively use the razor end of the TrimStyle razor. This product may work better for those who like a little more &amp;#34;down there,&amp;#34; but I can just use a regular Schick Hydro Silk razor to achieve the results I desire.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this razor during its bzzagent campaign and I have to say its leaves my legs positively smooth!! The blades glide super smooth and the moisturizing strip is great. I never ruse shaving cream and in my opinion you don&#x27;t need to with this razor! The only thing I wish was included is a blade cover for storage! As for the trimmer, it is not something I would generally use with the guard. Luckily the white guard is removable to allow you to have a smoother trim in those sensitive areas! Overall its a fantastic razor with trimming capabilities. Its a WIN WIN!</li>
    <li> What a great idea! The wet/dry shaver is perfect, especially on days when you forget to do the trimming before you get all wet in the shower. BUT, it definitely doesn&#x27;t work as well when it&#x27;s fighting wet hair. I like the weight of it, and the fact that the handle has to be thicker than the usual razor. It fits in my hand well, and doesn&#x27;t hurt my fingers trying to hold onto it.  The blades are sharp and get all the hair. Definitely highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have to say I got this razor about a month or so ago through a program called BzzAgent. This product is amazing. Unlike other razors this one really does the trick. My legs have never been smoother in my life. I&#x27;ve been using buffer hair off mitts and an electric waterproof shaver, but this little thing has done amazing job. I switched once to see what happened if I didn&#x27;t use the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle and to my wondering eye the hair grew back super fast and my legs were never as smooth with the convention shaver or razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bikini trimmer was a little odd. I haven&#x27;t used one before and I was confused with it, but It did work. I liked the fact you could use it without the trimmer adjuster... :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the product is great and I&#x27;m planning to buy more heads because this seems to be able to last a long time. Plus my legs are so smooth it makes shaving fun... Oh yes, you can also use it for the under arms if you want.. LOVE IT!!!! Thank you, Schick.</li>
    <li> I got this razor from Bzzagent and schick to review. It is good for what it does. It gives me a close shave on my legs and armpits. Not so good gor bikin line, but the trim does work well. Good razor</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that you need for summer. Not only does it provide you excellent shaving coverage for your legs with the hydro silk strip you can actually skip the shaving cream if you want! I have never gotten razor burn or bumps when using this razor. And now that it is has the TrimStyle bikini tool on the other end I have actually cancelled all of my waxing appointments. Not only does this product save me money and time it saves me some pain!&lt;br /&gt;The fact that the TrimStyle portion is powered by a battery makes the level of trimming even better!&lt;br /&gt;I could not be any more pleased with Schick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I did receive this product free to test out however my results and opinion are real</li>
    <li> I got this product free from BzzAgent and I&#x27;m pleased with it. I trim/shave my bikini line, but maybe not as often as some people, so the trimmer is perfect for getting my hair short enough to shave with ease. I love the moisturizing razors and how they make shaving a breeze. The only complaint I have is the cost of replacement blades. I wish they were more reasonably priced...</li>
    <li> This 2-in-1 makes it easier to get the bikini line ready! The blades &amp; moisturizing strip keep you soft &amp; smooth while the adjustable trim length makes it super fast &amp; easy to get done! The only &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; aspect is that when you use the razor for the first time, the moisturizing strip is extra goopy. I received my razor via BzzAgent for free to try.</li>
    <li> Worst trimmer ever. Maybe if the hair you are trimming hasn&#x27;t seen a razor in months and sticks straight out you could see some results. The guard on the trimmer doesn&#x27;t &#x27;guide&#x27; the hair into the trimmer. It might work without the guard if you didn&#x27;t get cut :/ The razor side works okay.</li>
    <li> I love the razor! It gets my skin super smooth with an ultra-close shave! The hydrating strips on the band are fantastic and help so much with getting that super smooth skin. The trimmer wasn&#x27;t fantastic, but it works well enough and does it&#x27;s intended purpose. Recieved this free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as an offer from Bzz Agent, it was free to try, and this is by far the best razor.  It takes care of many areas when shaving.  At first I was a little apprehensive about using it in the shower, being battery powered, but it has proven it&#x27;s self there is nothing to worry about.  It gives a great shave to the areas in question.  Not to close, but close enough for a smooth shave and soft feel.  I like that it gives my legs the smooth touch, and at the same time, I can shave my bikini area with out having any irritation.  My legs have never looked any better, and they are not prickly after the shave.  Now I can go out to the lake and pool with confidence too, knowing that there is no more scary hair on me in any area.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a free sample as part of a BzzAgent campaign. I love this razor. It cuts really close and has a nice moisture strip. However, despite the cool little plastic feature on the back that&#x27;s supposed to keep the razor elevated off of surfaces, I found that the moisture strip, if left upside down in the shower, would seep out. I also really like the trimmer feature. It&#x27;s small and not cumbersome at all. However, I didn&#x27;t think that the two features needed to be together. I was either showering using a large, bulky razor, and not needing the trimmer, or I was trimming and trying to dodge the razor (doesn&#x27;t come with a cover). I never needed the two features at the same time. I loved the razor and trimmer, but not necessarily together.</li>
    <li> The Hydo Silk razor - so smooth I can&#x27;t even get over it. Whenever there is a razor that you do not need shaving cream - I&#x27;m all-in. But for Hydro Silk, not only do you not need shaving cream, you also don&#x27;t need to put lotion on after! Okay, I did anyways, because I was so pumped about how smooth my skin was after, I figured why not try and make it even healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of razors that have some type of hydration on the razor tend to fade fairly quick. So I was a little skeptical going into my second, third, forth, ect, ect, shave. But am extremely pleased with how long the moisture strip lasted!</li>
    <li> I like this product,  I like the thick handle and it leaves my legs and bikini area very smooth.  The trimmer is not very beneficial to me, for any purpose though.  I will use this razor, as I think it is one of the best products, but the trimmer just isn&#x27;t practical for me.  I did get this item as a free trial!</li>
    <li> I got this razor as part of a Bzzagent campaign. No need for shaving cream! The moisture strips work amazingly well, leaving skin soft and touchably smooth. The blades did get a little rusty after a week or so though. The TrimStyle has nicked me more than once and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all. I personally prefer no hair in my bikini area so the trimmer seemed redundant. I get a nice smooth shave with the razor side though!</li>
    <li> I received the Schick hydro silk trimstlye through #buzzagent. I absolutely love it! I won&#x27;t be using any other razor. Its so easy and safe to use. Infused with shea butter it leaves my skin silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I received this to try and am glad I did! I&#x27;ve been a loyal Venus Embrace user and the razor definitely surpassed my expectations. I was left with super smooth legs that lasted longer than with my Embrace.  Unfortunately, I have to shave almost everyday (it sucks) and it felt like I could go longer after using this razor.  As far as the bikini trimmer, I didn&#x27;t really enjoy it.  It reminded me of watching my husband trim his beard.  I feel this is great if you prefer to have more hair as opposed to those who prefer a full shave.</li>
    <li> i really like mostly everything about this item! definitely will be my go-to razor from now on. however i&#x27;m not quite sure how to adjust the guard so i just remove it completely and it works fine i have not been cut or injured by either end of the razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a positive experience with this razor and &amp;#34;built-in&amp;#34; trimmer. Compared to other types of disposable/reusable razors, this is my most favorite. It  has a built in serum that&#x27;s receptive to water, where it helps your skin retain moisture (therefore not being super dry, rather moisturized). The trimmer is easy to use, and is easy to clean (you might need to use a toothpick or a q-tip to clean the trimmer, in addition with little water).&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is straightforward - you can open the box, and remove the razor. A minor issue that was that instructions were in the inside of the box (printed in one of the panels) - if you wanted to keep the box for further information, that would mean that you&#x27;d have to cut the box. If I hadn&#x27;t gotten this for free (via BuzzAgent - an awesome organization that allows you to review items), I would have been a little annoyed (especially if I wanted to return it for whatever reason). Also, replacing the razor heads might be difficult (I accidentally dislodged mine, and it took me at least 10 minutes to put it back on... not cool). Finally... the button that you press to have the razor or trimmer vibrate is manual, which means whenever you might want to use that option, you might have to press that for a good amount of time. This definitely lengthened my shower, but it wasn&#x27;t the end of the world, just a little annoying. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is trying to remove some additional body hair in a quick way! For me, the positives outweigh the negatives... consider purchasing this product!</li>
    <li> I really love this thing! It works great I even used the trimmer end on my 1yrs olds hair and it worked great. I received this to try from bzzagent and I really can&#x27;t say enough about it. It is totally worth the money, just try it I know your will agree.</li>
    <li> Let me jut say I love this razor/trimmer!! I&#x27;m really happy with how everything works and how well turns out. But if you not careful those five razors will cut you.. I was shaving before work and rushed it alittle. I know my bad, but it was my first time using something with that many razors on it. I&#x27;m a part of bzzagent and got to try it for free or I wouldn&#x27;t of even of thought to try it. I&#x27;m very happy I got the chance to and will keep using it for a long time to come! Love schick hydro silk trimstyle!!!</li>
    <li> I just received my Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini Trimmer in the mail for free thanks to BzzAgent. I thought the razor part was great close shave super smooth and the gel worked awesomely with out getting shaving cream every where. On the other side you had the trimmer which was very loud and did not get a close shave at all, I would have loved to just have the razor and gel and skip the trimmer</li>
    <li> The product is worth every penny.  It is very convenient having the trimmer and razor in one.  The razor blade is replaceable but the trimmer blade is not.  It takes one AAA battery.  You can use it in or out of the shower.  Specific to myself is that I have started using a small amount of coconut oil in the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; areas and it works great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but every time I use the razor to shave my legs I end up with razor burn. The first time it was a lot, and now it&#x27;s a small amount, but it&#x27;s still there. It&#x27;s so frustrating. I would discontinue using this, but I LOVE the personal trimmer side. It&#x27;s so easy to use. Even more it&#x27;s so safe. No nicks or cuts anywhere with the personal trimmer. If you have sensitive skin I would hesitate on using this to shave. I&#x27;m glad I got this free through bzzagent, or I would be upset that I spent money just to keep getting razor burn.</li>
    <li> I got to try for free my razor trough bzzagent campaign and i have to say i love this razor. not only do you have a side which will grace your legs flawlessly but you also have a side that will give your bikini area hair less smooth felling life Thank you buzzagent.com</li>
    <li> I received the [[ASIN:B00SMIIR0W Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini Trimmer]] at no cost as part of a BzzAgent campaign. I was excited to try it out- I have coarse dark hair that needs a lot of maintenance and I am always on the lookout for the perfect razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was nice to be able to use this razor right out of the box. Just twist the razor apart in the middle, insert the included battery, and off you go! The instructions are printed directly on the box and are easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor: The five blades give an incredibly close shave. It didn&#x27;t feel like I was actually shaving (for a moment I thought I had missed removing a cover), but lo and behold, hair was coming off of my legs! I wanted to see how long I could go between shaves and it&#x27;s definitely longer than with other blades that I&#x27;ve tried- 5 days later and my legs are still fairly smooth. Color me impressed! (I will say that my legs didn&#x27;t necessarily feel any more moisturized than usual- perhaps I didn&#x27;t use the moisture strip properly- I&#x27;ll have to focus on that with my next shave.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer: I have to admit to being a little let down. I have used trimmers before, many years ago, but I never found them particularly effective. I was hoping for an improvement in the technology, but the trimmed area is not terribly smooth and I have red bumps all over. I did like the comb and the different settings, once I got the hang of it, it was simple to use. Taking the comb off and putting it back on is a little clumsy to start, however once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s quite easy. I haven&#x27;t attempted to take the trimmer head out to clean it, but I will do so before I use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am really happy with several aspects of this razor- especially the shaving blades. I do like having the trimmer option as part of the razor, I just had to manage my expectations in regards to the trimmer. I&#x27;m not going to get baby smooth skin on my bikini line, but as a starting point (especially of you haven&#x27;t maintained that area for some time) it works reasonably well.nt (especially of you haven&#x27;t maintained that area for some time) it works reasonably well.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through BzzAgent &amp; all opinions are my own. With that being said, I only had one major fault with it. There should be a guard included so when you want to use the razor end you don&#x27;t slice your fingers on the other end (where the blades are..) Other than that, no real faults &amp; it works very well!</li>
    <li> So, when I received my Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle for free from BuzzAgent I was super excited to give it a try. The packaging is appealing and I like that it’s a neutral and calming color. I did have a problem with the directions being on the inside of the packaging because I had to be conscious of not ripping it while opening the package. I wish it was a separate paper or on the outside so I am more aware it is there. I went out and bought the Moroccan shaving gel to make sure I have the best experience with the TrimStyle. I did not want to write a review until I used it a couple of times and to see how my skin reacted because it is pretty sensitive. I am a true Schick fan and my husband and myself really enjoy the men collection. This is the first time I used a female Schick product. When I first used the 5 blade razor I knew it was true to the men’s 5 blade and I instantly knew I liked it. It’s so smooth and I really enjoy the water-activated moisturizing serum. I also enjoyed the size of the handle and curve because it made it easier to handle and maneuver. In the past I have had issues with the moisturizing strips getting goopy and so gross after a time or two of use and I can tell you that I did NOT have this problem with the Schick Hydro Silk TrimSyle. Now, I am a little indifferent about the trimmer on the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle. First off, I have never used a trimmer on my bikini area and I had no idea how to use it. I thought the directions would tell me which way to trim as well as how hard to press and to my surprise it didn’t. Luckily my husband was home and explained the best way to use a trimmer. I tried my bikini line first and it really was awkward and didn’t really do anything. I then tried a bigger area and I have come to a conclusion that it really isn’t for me. I need a closer shave and I really don’t let that area get too long anyway so I don’t think I benefit from the trimmer. I did use the razor and it was PEFECT! Not cuts, close shave, and no irritation. Luckily, my husband used the trimmer on his “area” and said it worked for him and he enjoyed the adjustable comb. I also found some helpful tips on the Schick website for shaving legs, underarms, and bikini areas. You should check it out to get a refresher! #GotItFreets, close shave, and no irritation.

    <li> I received this free from Bzzagent.com. I waited a wile to write my review because I wanted to get some use out of it first. So far I, on my 6th shave and its working well. Ive still not had to repeat the same area more than once and it truly does have a wonderful moisture strip that is still going strong. The first use,I didn&#x27;t even have to lotion my legs afterwards and they stayed oft and silky til the next day. Ive never had that happen when using a razor.I find after the sixth use I still don&#x27;t have to moisturize but I do anyways.  I will say the packaging was nice and easy to open and it came with a brand name battery to use inside . I liked the fact it did vibrate while shaving ,I feel it helps get a closer shave. Instead  of a suction wall hanger for the razor it has a built in stand to set on your counter or shower ledge, which ill say I like much better than the wall hanger. Less waste if you ask me. The razor is still sharp after its sixth use and moisture strip is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, its a tad bulky to use and the on/off button is kind of hard to turn on and off especially with wet shaving cream hands. But not a deal breaker. It could just be mine and they all are a tad different in the on/off department. The bikini trimmer is just okay. It doesn&#x27;t do a great job but its a good start to taking it down a little before you shave it bare. It was a little hard to hold and maneuver at this end as well. Overall its a nice  product and ill probably keep using it. Walmart sells the razor for about $16,so I would probably not order from Amazon it seems steep.</li>
    <li> Hands down best razor on the planet ! I revived this free from bzzagent to test. Thank god where has this been all my life lol the razor is so soft and smooth and I use the trimmer for sensitive areas and I can even use it to trim my eyebrows! Amazing (:</li>
    <li> I got this product, thanks to BzzAgent in the mail a few days ago. I love the razor part of the product! I forgot how nice a razor with the little gel thing on it is. I used to use these all the time, but they just got to be too expensive for me to buy so I had to resort back to the cheap ones. Oh gosh that silky smooth feeling you get when using a razor like this is such a wonderful thing.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer part.....it&#x27;s good. It does what it is intended for...to trim. I prefer to shave that area more, so I suppose I will use the trimmer to rid some hair before shaving the rest off. But I did have to write in my review to the company that they need to provide more/better instructions on how to use the trimmer. Women don&#x27;t usually know how to use things like this, but it&#x27;s like they assumed we did. I had to ask my husband before I could use it...and even then I was still a little confused lol. I like seeing pictures, that&#x27;s how I learn, so I wished they would have provided better instructions.</li>
    <li> So, I got this razor free from Bzzagent. Bzzagent is basically like a bunch of product testers like you would find in a factory, but we do it from our home in our real life families. Anyway, I&#x27;m pretty loyal to my Bic soleil razors, they get me closest shave and they don&#x27;t bust my wallet in half. Well, this razor is a game changer.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little bigger than most traditional razors, but I like that, it gives me a better grip and I can shave faster. The shave is close and even, without making my skin dry and flakey afterwards. The trimmer side works well in water, but works even better when dry so do that part dry first, then turn on the water if you find that works better.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like that this combines two steps for me and I will be switching to a new razor :)</li>
    <li> When I tried this razor I was skeptical, however, once i used it I was greatly surprised by the shave and also I noticed that I had a reduction in razor burn.  I would recommend this product to others to use as well!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate shaving. I usually end up buying a guy&#x27;s razor because it does a better job. I usually miss areas and get really bad razor burn or my legs end up with flaky dry patches. BUT I found a razor that&#x27;s not all that bad. This razor moisturizers so well and I almost all the time get all of the hair . The reason for 4 stars? The moisture strip gets gooey. Like drippy goo that hardens in weird shapes  but all you have to do is get it wet again and it goes away.</li>
    <li> I have been so excited about this razor ever since I received it for testing purposes from BzzAgent. I may have gotten this product for free, but my opinion is 100% honest. This razor is worth purchasing for so many reasons. It moisturizers my legs and underarms and they end up feeling incredibly smooth. Also, I had no experience with trimmers at all, but the dual ended feature of this razor really intrigued me. It took me a few times before I really learned how to work the trimmer, but once I finally got the hang of it I was impressed with how well it worked. I recommend this razor to everyone. It has made shaving so much easier and less frustrating for me.</li>
    <li> Easy to set up and use. I like the ability to change the trimmers height and that the razor head sits up off the tub wall. I received rhis free to try from bZzagent and was concerned it would leave me sliced up and prickly but my legs are still smooth after two days and that&#x27;s great for my busy lifestyle. For me this is a win!</li>
    <li> It is an okay product. Be careful because when I was using it, the razor end had ended up popping itself off three times or so. I used it in the shower, and am just glad I didn&#x27;t cut my foot at all. Overall, it&#x27;s alright. Would I purchase in the future? I&#x27;m not too certain I would.</li>
    <li> LOVE my new Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle!&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this razor is the razor I&#x27;ve been looking for for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I love how comfortable the handle is, with it being thicker than the standard razor handle, it makes it way easier/more comfortable to shave and I find that it doesn&#x27;t slip out of my hand like all of my other razors!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and have found nothing to complain about! The gel-type stuff around the blades make for a SUPER SMOOTH shave. I haven&#x27;t even bothered using shave cream anymore (even for my bikini and underarm areas!!). What I REALLY like about the gel around the blades is that it lasts!! Every single time I use it, it&#x27;s as smooth and soft as the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;Such a close shave that I have noticed I typically go a whole extra day before having to shave my underarms again! I used to have to shave my underarms every single day. Doing that plus the irritation from my bad old razors caused a lot of razor burn so eventually I would find myself having to grow them out for a few days waiting for the razor burn to go away! Which is not fun. Now I can shave every single day without any razor burn if I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have quite as much to say about the trimmer because I don&#x27;t really find myself just trimming any of my hair. But I have tried it on my finances beard! It was nice that I could move the comb on the tip of the trimmer to choose the length of hair. He also said it felt really comfortable! It&#x27;s not very loud which is also nice.&lt;br /&gt;Love this razor and highly reccommend trying it out!</li>
    <li> I received the razor as part of a promotion from the brand. The idea behind the decision is great! Its super convenient and easy to use without giving up the quality of the razor. I would recommend this product to any one!</li>
    <li> I received this razor for review from BzzAgent. I really like this bikini area trimmer. I found it very easy to use and that it accommodates for various lengths is a plus. I did not like this razor for shaving my legs, as I was use to the lightness of just the razor and cut myself a few times. I like that the TrimStyle can be kept in the shower and uses a battery (which lasts a long time).</li>
    <li> Have to admit, Schick Hydro Silk is not my preferred brand for moisturizing razors. I received the product as a free sample and tried it out as an alternative to my regular moisturizing razor. The overall design is easy to hold and cute. I did think it was only average for typical shaving needs, like legs. I found that it did not need shave gel, but was definitely better if used with.&lt;br /&gt;The bikini trimmer part, on the other hand, was incredible. It was super easy to use with the comb attachment and even easier to clean. If you want a quality trimmer, it may be worth the averageness of the razor part.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this razor. I am a BzzAgent and received this in my BzzKit to try for free. I have always been a fan of the Schick Hydro line, but never really thought the TrimStyle razor would work as well as my body trimmer I currently use. I am so glad that I was given this to try because I can&#x27;t see myself using a different razor. Makes shaving and trimming my bikini area so much easier and definitely quicker!</li>
    <li> I got this razor from Bzzagent and decided to try it out for a few days before I wrote a review on it. So far it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin especially since I don&#x27;t use shaving cream. It leaves my legs so smooth!! I love that it has five blades so I get a closer shave in one stroke and I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same area. Overall, it&#x27;s a great razor but I haven&#x27;t tried the bikini trimmer so I can&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotion to review it and give my honest opinion. I love this TrimStyle for many reasons. First,it has a moisturize strip which makes my legs feel super soft no lotion needed. It also is an amazing bikini shaver. Also it has a stand built on it that doesn&#x27;t get in the way but does keep the razor off of surfaces and prevents rust. :)</li>
    <li> I received this razor/trimmer through BzzAgent and am very pleased with it!  I have not used the razor portion of this, but the bikini area trimmer is incredible!  I have tried several trimmers and none compare to this product! I love the adjustable trimmer guard.  I would purchase this item even if the razor was not attached and it was simply the trimmer.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I recieved this product in the mail from bzzagent a few days ago. I was so excited when i got it. It definetely lived up to my excitement. It did everything promised. Both ends did so well i love it more than my venus. I will continue using it after the test period definitely! So easy to use and so easy to make yours. Having to hold down the power on the trimmer is a slight bummer, but everything else is perfect!</li>
    <li> Got this razor free through a promotion from the brand and so glad I did! I have always used the Gillette Venus razor but will be switching over after trying this razor. The manual razor end is great for shaving my legs and armpit area. I love how smooth it feels on my skin and I don&#x27;t even feel the blades at all yet it still shaves nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bikini trimmer is also a great feature though a little tricky to figure out at first. Once you get the hang of it though, it works efficiently enough though I emphasize that it is more a trimmer than a shaver so don&#x27;t expect to get all the hair shaved off your bikini area especially if you have a lot of hair down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it comes with a little stand that keeps the razor dry and keeps it from getting rusted.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle in the mail from BzzAgent a few weeks ago to try out. Because I have been using the regular Schick Hydro razors for years, I was excited to see that they now have a razor with a waterproof trimmer attached. I have used both the trimmer and razor on several occasions and have to say they work amazingly. I get an even trim with the trimmer and the razor works just like my Hydro razor that I&#x27;ve been using for years. The only downfall for the trimmer is that you have to keep your finger on the power button the entire time you use it, otherwise it won&#x27;t stay on. It can be annoying, but the button is easy to press. This is great for travel so you don&#x27;t have to carry a razor and trimmer separately. It is bulkier than a regular razor of course, but it&#x27;s shape makes it easy to pack without taking up a lot of room. I will still carry my regular razor with me for short trips, but will absolutely continue to use TrimStyle. Would definitely recommend this, especially for the summer months.</li>
    <li> I got this razor free through bzzagent. I was very satisfied with it. I loved that it moisturized as you shave. On the other hand I didn&#x27;t really care for the trimmer on it. It seemed to pull your hair out more than trim it. I will definitely use the razor again but not for the trimmer that part is horrible.</li>
    <li> I received his product for free thanks to BzzAgent, I would recommend this to anyone. I generally use schick products however this has been the best so far.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best razor I have ever owned. It&#x27;s so smooth on my skin, I don&#x27;t even worry about cutting myself when I use it. I use to dread shaving my arms and legs, but now I do it without hesitation. It&#x27;s soft to touch and glides along the curves of my skin. Shaving my legs, arms, and my sensitive areas are now a breeze, which is why I retired all my other shaving products. This will be the only tool I need to get through those hairy days. I received this free product from BzzAgent to review, however, my opinion of this product is very real and honest.</li>
    <li> A pretty decent razor. Love the dual features. The trimmer really comes in handy on lazy days and to complete my routine. It is a little awkward at first but works well once you&#x27;re used to it. The shave isn&#x27;t super close and the blades cut a little more than other razors, but its good. I wait for it to go on sale or GET IT FREE at I did with BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. I am so glad I tried it! The moisture serum makes a HUGE difference on my skin. For someone not used to using a trimmer I was lost but it was easy to learn. The size can be bulky but the way my skin feels - I can deal with the size!</li>
    <li> I love this razor! It makes your skin so soft because of the moisture strips! The 5 blades make your shave so smooth and the trimmer adjusts to different lengths and you can use it in the shower or out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free for review</li>
    <li> This little razor is heaven in blade form. It truly lives up to its name. When you use it your skin feels moisturized and soft, unlike other that seriously leave you feeling dry and bleeding. There is a nice balance to this razor also, the rod shape helps you achieve the best outcome for those hard to get ankle areas. If it had a cap to cover the blades it would be a six star item. I&#x27;m really happy with this item, I got it free but I&#x27;ll be sure to purchase again in the near future.</li>
    <li> The razor side of the Hydro Silk TrimStyle is super moisturizing, and I really appreciated the extra blade, however it felt a little stiff and definitely a little hard to maneuver around my knees.  On the razor alone, I probably would&#x27;ve given this product 4 or 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t like the bikini trimmer.  It was hard to turn on and unwieldy to handle.  Maybe I&#x27;m just not great in that area to begin with, but I had a really hard time using it and i really felt like i was going to slip and cut myself pretty much the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how this produce would work for some women, but really really not for me.</li>
    <li> I love this Razor! Its the razor in use normally but having a trimmer on the other end makes it even better. It&#x27;s perfect for when you don&#x27;t have time to shave your area.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! I&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive razors to cheap throw away razors and they all tear my legs up. I have dry, sensitive skin so having a razor that doesn&#x27;t cut up my legs, and leaves my legs feeling soft is important to me. Just with the first use I could tell this was a razor I could stick to. Not to mention the bikini trimmer is great; easy to use and adjustable. I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone! It keeps my legs softer, for longer! I&#x27;m so excited I received this for free from BzzCampain</li>
    <li> This shaver really works well for the price. Clean smooth shave I must say.</li>
    <li> First, I am a BzzAgent, and received a free Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always loved the Hydro Silk razors, they work wonders for my legs and underarms, leaving them well moisturized after use, and irritation free; that last one is very important for me, as I have incredibly sensitive and fickle skin. Though the TrimStyle is a most wonderful addition to my favorite razor, I&#x27;ve noticed, the more I use the TrimStyle razor, the more razor burn/bumps I get, and before I am asked; yes I make sure to exfoliate, yes I moisturize (lots), I use a light pressure, and I don&#x27;t go over an area more than once (unless I absolutely have to, though no more than twice.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are pros and cons to the Hydro Silk with TrimStyle razor, and I will quickly cover them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- skin is silky smooth, especially when paired with additional moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;- you can get at least 5 uses out of each cartridge&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t nick behind my knees as often, it only happens once in a great while now.&lt;br /&gt;- the TrimStyle is incredibly nice to have attached to other end of a razor&lt;br /&gt;- it really is waterproof, I was terrified to use it in the beginning because I was skeptical of its claims&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- the handle is chunky due to the TrimStyle being added, I have fibromyalgia, and the handle makes it harder for me to hold, compared to the contoured handle of the Hydro Silk&lt;br /&gt;- razor burn in the bikini zone from the TrimStyle, which is an obvious bummer, however, I didn&#x27;t start getting the razor burn, until I used it a couple of times&lt;br /&gt;- because the handle is wider, the razor has lost its contoured shaving and flexible head, I have to be more careful when going around my knees to prevent cuts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I do like the Hydro Silk with TrimStyle, despite it having a few kinks to iron out.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I got this through bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this razor. I have been sent several others through bzzagent and influenster, but lately this is my go to. I shave my legs maybe three times a week (I love silky smooth skin) and this razor allows me to do this without any cuts or nicks. It leaves a silky smooth finish, and glides right down skin, which other razors I have been sent fail to do (they act like they are caught and make a squeaky noise sometimes). I dont use the trimmer, but I like that the option is there.</li>
    <li> I got the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor as a product to review on bzzagent.com. It is perfect for any kind of trip that involves a pool or the beach! Very travel friendly and convenient! Love how smooth my legs and gentle areas are left and with no irritation!</li>
    <li> I received this as a BzzAgent to try for free and was very excited at first--I love other Schick Hydro Silk razors and use them frequently.  The packaging was easy to get into and it was simple enough to put the battery in.  The razor itself is nice, like I mentioned I use Hydro Silk frequently, but it seemed to be a little lacking in the moisturizing part compared to the other razors I have used.  I can&#x27;t comment on the trimmer part-being 9 months pregnant I don&#x27;t have a use for it right now-but it turns on and off nicely and it seems like it would get the job done compared to other trimmers I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;The big deal breaker for me is that the razor is awkward to hold.  The battery part in the handle makes it really big and not that easy to maneuver while shaving.  Plus the trimmer part just adds to the awkwardness while shaving.  That and the sub-par moisture is what makes me give this product 3 stars.</li>
    <li> This Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor/bikini trimmer is a two in one.  This razor combo is amazing and by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  The razor has 5 blades for a super close shave and a moisturizing serum that actually makes for a 100% smooth shave with NO nicks.  I absolutely love this razor.  While using the razor,  i noticed that you can&#x27;t even feel it working..... it just does, kinda like magic.  The feel of the razor fits perfect in my hands, so i feel like I&#x27;m getting a safe shave with an excellent grip.  The blue is very pretty.  The trimmer is sooo cool.  It&#x27;s actually electronic and water proof at the same time!  Again with the good fit in my hands and the excellent grip , you feel like it&#x27;s very safe.  I&#x27;ve never used an electric trimmer before so i was kinda scared to try it.  It was so easy to use and I felt 100% safe once i started using it.  It works great.  Gets the job done and it does a good job at it too.  It was very comfortable.  I love that it&#x27;s water proof.  I think that&#x27;s pretty cool. I like that it&#x27;s battery operated.  I received the product free as a promotion through BzzAgent.  I can honestly say that I&#x27;m getting the refill blades.  This is my new razor and if you try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I know that this will be your new go to razor too.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I got this product to try for free from BzzAgent. I honestly was turned off by the price at first sine it is quite a bit. But after receiving this and trying it it was amazing! I have very sensitive skin so changing razors can be a scary thing since I don&#x27;t want my legs to break out. Well I gave this a try anyways. And I wish would have bought it when I first saw it! Amazing is the best way to describe it.</li>
    <li> The bikini trimmer rusted up tight after using in shower for 2 weeks.  Not good, we already threw it away.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini trimmer as a free product. I really enjoyed the razor itself. It gives a nice clean, smooth shave, but the trimmer made me hesitant. When using it there is no safety cover for the razor end and I didn&#x27;t like having an open razor in my hand. It made me nervous. I also think the trimmer itself is a little wide.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this product and purchase refill blades. It does what it&#x27;s mean to do and it&#x27;s a good value for it&#x27;s money :)</li>
    <li> I received this razor to try for free through Bzz Agent.  I tried the Schick Hydro Silk Razor through a previous Bzz campaign and absolutely loved it. It provides a smooth, close shave without nicks. I am very prone to razor bumps and the Schick Hydro Silk Razor has virtually eliminated that problem for me. I still use the Schick Hydro Silk Razor to this day, so I was excited to give the TrimStyle Razor a try. All I...&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Schick Hydro Silk Razor through a previous Bzz campaign and absolutely loved it. It provides a smooth, close shave without nicks. I am very prone to razor bumps and the Schick Hydro Silk Razor has virtually eliminated that problem for me. I still use the Schick Hydro Silk Razor to this day, so I was excited to give the TrimStyle Razor a try. All I can say is Ouch!! The trimmer pulled and tugged and left me with razor burn. I tried all of the settings, but they all were uncomfortable. I will not be using the trimmer end of the razor. The fact that the razor is on one end handle and the trimmer on the other would be convenient, but I found the handle to be a little bigger than the regular razor and a little awkward in my hand. I think I will just stick to the Schick Hydro Silk Razor and leave the TrimStyle alone.</li>
    <li> I was provided this product as a freebie by BzzAgent. I was really excited to receive this product. The packaging and product itself was very engaging. I should disclose that I am pregnant and as many of you mommas out there know - hair just grows faster during this time. I definitely think the trimmer would be a nice addition for someone who keeps their bikini area longer but if you keep it shorter normally then the trimmer is kind of unnecessary. For the razor side, it sharp and the moisturizing lotion that is built in is nice for those like me who shave in the shower on th go usually without using any kind of shaving cream. I will say that I&#x27;m not a fan of the handle as it is pretty large and I find that makes it harder to maneuver. The thing that really made the decision for me that I will not be switching from my normal razor is that, and please keep in mind my pregnancy might be a contributing factor, but I just felt like the razor didn&#x27;t provide a close enough shave for me. I may need to take a second look at this product after my little one arrives.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a free promotion and was excited to try it out. I&#x27;ve had trouble finding a really good razor and as they are so expensive I don&#x27;t want to waste my money buying every single new one that comes out, so I was excited to get the opportunity to try this out for free. I have used Schick products before, my most recent razor was one of their men&#x27;s razors as they were significantly cheaper (I discovered that the men&#x27;s refills work with this and are the same quality so if you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper option that&#x27;s the way to go). The razor gives an incredibly smooth shave, even without using shaving cream. I was a bit scared about doing this as I haven&#x27;t had good experiences shaving without cream previously, but it was amazing. No nicks or bumps or anything! It even gives a close shave in your armpits and bikini line without shaving cream, and in fact in those areas it gave less bumps and nicks than when I tried it with the shaving cream. I was definitely sold on the razor end of things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a little less luck with the trimming end. There are three length options and naively I started with the shortest option. It shaved all the hair almost entirely off, which is not what I wanted. It&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re going for that look and you can then use the razor end to clean everything up, but it&#x27;s not at all what I wanted. I&#x27;m probably going to stick with the third length from now on, once the hair grows back long enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also when I was playing with the trimmer I slipped and sliced my hand pretty deep, so definitely be careful when changing the length options because the blade is very sharp and the plastic cover is hard to get off.</li>
    <li> I got this product through BzzAgent to try and I love it! Great razor, great trimmer, and the fact that it is in the same package makes it that much better! Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I love that this Schick razor comes paired with a bikini trimmer! Thanks to bzzagent.com, I received this razor/trimmer for free and was asked to test it out and review it. So here is my honest opinion... It is so nice to save space in the shower by having an all-in-one razor and trimmer. It is also a bonus that it is completely water proof so I can both shave and trim all during my shower. I love the Hydro Silk produce both above and below the razor blades and I honestly think they make my shave more enjoyable...and my legs and bikini area are so much smoother than when I just use a regular razor. The only dislike I have is that the Hydro Silk product has starting oozing off of the razor and when it touches anything else in shower, including the shelf I have it on, it sticks. The razor does have a sort of kickstand on it to set it down because it does not fit into any of the other Schick hanging hooks. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this product and would recommend it to everyone. Additionally, I have very sensitive skin and this razor makes for a more comfortable, close shave with NO irritating rash after! Get one!!</li>
    <li> This razor was the best razor that i have ever used. The 5 blades help with getting a close shave and it leaves your legs silky and in my case the results lasted longer than with other razors I&#x27;ve used in the past. The trimmer is also amazing and i love the fact that you can use it in the shower, it makes things a lot easier. After using this razor i don&#x27;t think i will ever go back to those cheap single blade razors ever again. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Honestly, I never knew something like this existed until running into this handy little product.First off, I love the blue color. But on a more practical sense, the razor and trimmer both work great. I&#x27;m pretty sure my legs have never felt smoother than when I use this razor. It. is. glorious. I would highly recommend this product. It is perfect for summer! Just an FYI, I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand, and will probably end up purchasing this product again in the future!!</li>
    <li> Amazing shave plus it water proof so you can use the 5 blade razor and trim in the&lt;br /&gt;shower. Battery easy to replace and blades as well. I love this razor!!!! Will be buy replacement blades!!!! I got it has a promotion on bzzagent</li>
    <li> If I were rating only the razor I would give it five stars, gentle and close cut, especially because of the water activated serum which I was able to shave without gel!!! I had no razor bumps or nicks, which is rare for me... but then I usually use cheap razors, this converted me to schick high quality razors to start caring for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I gave it three stars for the trimmer which at the lowest level with a cover is not a close trim AT ALL and without the plastic cover I cut myself.... A LOT. so the trimmer is not worth it unless you are trimming a jungle to make a smaller jungle.&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a free tester for Schick promotional purposes.</li>
    <li> This was a amazing purchase. I originally purchase this razor for the trimmer because I thought it was time to get rid of my bush. I used the guard on the trimmer at the shortest level first, and then I use the trimmer without the guard and it worked wonders. The razor itself is also great. It has A shaving gel that reminds me of aloe vera and at my third use it still has a lot. Overall a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Such a good product! Used it once and I&#x27;m in love already!</li>
    <li> I just put this razor through the ultimate test. I shaved my lady parts with my glasses off. My eyesight is so bad that I can&#x27;t see my lady parts in the shower It was nerve-wracking, yes, but worth the attempt. The only test beyond what I just did would be to shave with my eyes closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly tell you that this razor did not pull on any of my hairs or nick my skin. I did press much more firmly, at times, than I ever would have when I could see. Normally it would be terrifying to even think about applying that much pressure with a razor on such a sensitive area. The end result: the hairs are short just barely protruding out of the skin, but most people will be happy with that because it will let you avoid the painful, itchy growing back process that so many people hate.This was all done with the trimmer end after I took the adjuster completely off. That being said, if you want to use the trimmer in a location that you plan on displaying to the public, you may want to u... Read more</li>
    <li> Works fantastic! The razor leaves my legs really smooth unlike most disposable razors I&#x27;ve used. The razor runs acrossed your skin so smoothly you don&#x27;t feel like its doing anything. The trimmer is a trimmer it trims, not meant for down to the skin shave but it gets close enough so you can just run the razor through and boom smooth!</li>
    <li> My Legs And Bikini Area Hair&#x27;s Feel Sharper Than A Prickly Bear. I Have Hated Shaving Because The Razors I Use, Give Me Razor Burns, Or I Miss Hair, And Have To Spend 10 Minutes Going Over And Over My Legs And Don&#x27;t Even Get Me Started On How Long It Takes To Get Every Nook And Cranny Of My Bikini Area To Be Hair Free. I Got My New Free Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle Razor From BzzAgent In The Mail About A Week Ago, And I Did An Experiment. I Shaved My Right Leg With My Normal Disposable Razor (A New One) And Silk Shaving Cream. Then, I Shaved My Left Leg With The New Hydro Silk, The Right Leg Was The Same As Always Missed Hairs, And Spent About 5-8 Minutes Trying To Get Everything Smooth. I Shaved My Left Leg With My New Hydro Silk, And OMG So Much Better!! I Didn&#x27;t Regret Not Using Shaving Cream, And My Leg Was SOOOOO Much Smoother Feeling With Whatever Awesome Lotion They Have In The Razor Head. So, As Far As The Razor Goes, This New Product Gets 5 Stars From Me! However, Overall, I Have To Give 4 Stars. This Is why&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I Was Excited To Try Out The New Battery Operated Bikini End Of The Schick Hydro Silk. I&#x27;d Never Used An Electronic Bikini Shaver Before. There Are Three Lengths You Can Set The White Plastic Razor Guard So You Can Pick Your Hair Length. I Tried All Three Settings, And Even Took Off The Guard And Tried Using The Razor That Way, But For The Life Of Me I Couldn&#x27;t Get It To Work In My Bikini Hair Area. It Could Have Been That My Hair Was Already Too Short, But I Was A Little Disappointed That I Couldn&#x27;t Get It To Shave Like I Wanted. HOWEVER, Even Though I Couldn&#x27;t Get It To Work For It&#x27;s Intended Purpose, I Again Decided To Experiment. Some Of You May Think I&#x27;m Crazy But Oh My Goodness, The Electronic &amp;#34;Bikini&amp;#34; Shaver Works  Well For Trimming/Removing ( Arm hair, EYEBROW (Yes Eyebrow) Hair (Not Recommended If You Don&#x27;t Have A Steady Hand), Last But Not Least Boyfriend/Fiance/Husband Beard/Face Trimmer.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini Trimmer from a BzzAgent campaign.  I was so excited to recieve it.  The razer came with a battery to use the trimmer and i was really impressed with that.  I thought it was awesome that the trimmer was battery operated so it could be used in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is awesome.  It is my favorite razor that I have ever used.  It left my skin feeling smooth.  The moisture strip actually works.  I did use shave cream along with the razor, but you almost don&#x27;t need it.  I got a very close shave and did not get any razor burn or bumps from using it.  The head on the razor pivots nicely and makes for a smoother shave in harder to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not impressed with the bikini trimmer.  It could be because my hair was not long or thick enough for it to work with the trimmer, but I found it kind of awkward and not easy to use.  I do think the battery is an awesome idea.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product free from BzzAgent and Schick Hydro Silk. Although I&#x27;m not crazy about the razor side (the shave wasn&#x27;t the closest I&#x27;ve ever had, although my legs were super hydrated!), the bikini trimmer is saving me tons of money (and pain!) on waxing. This product is also convenient since it&#x27;s all-in-one. It takes up less room in my shower!</li>
    <li> I received this razor throuh BzzAgent to test out and give my opinion. My opinion has not bee swayed just because this item was free. I have received tons of product from BzzAgent and some haven&#x27;t been something that I would ever try again, it happens. However, THIS razor/trimmer is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I absolutely dread when it&#x27;s time to do a full body shave because I am a busy woman and it&#x27;s so time consuming and I shave everything! This includes my arms, legs, happy trail, bikini area, and other private areas. My boyfriend also shaves his body besides his massive beard. He shave his back, arms, legs, chest, underams, etc. You get the picture. So we&#x27;ve learned to invest in the best of razors and creams as well as techniques to keep the hair away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERDICT: I will be buying more cartridges and have already used the encolsed coupons for friends and my sisters.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and have yet to need to change the blade (I use it nearly every day). In addition to the blade staying sharp, the moisturizing strip it still doing it&#x27;s job and is keeping my legs smooth. I also find with this razor that I get little to no razor burn when shaving my bikini line. I have tried many razors in the past and until this one, thought I&#x27;d be using a men&#x27;s razor as those were the only ones that gave a close enough shave. This Schick razor has blown them all away! The trimmer offers 3 different settings for how close of a trim you&#x27;re looking for (with the closest trim leaving very little hair). I am a fan for life!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I get such a close shave. It lasts very long. I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile &amp; it still hasn&#x27;t dulled. I love the hydrosilk layer that keeps my skin soft &amp; I love that it has a trimmer, too.</li>
    <li> So, full disclosure, I received one of these free from BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and I definitely like it. I used to use a Venus razor with the skintimate lotion bars on the blades. One thing I noticed (and liked) was that you still got a moisturizer on this blade, but they aren&#x27;t these floppy bars that will fall off after one or two shaves. Those skintimate bars would dissolve and/or fall off pretty quickly and before I knew it, I would just have a regular blade. What I do love about this razor is the trimmer. It&#x27;s sooo convenient! It&#x27;s one of those things where I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until I had it. It does have various levels you can trim at, but I found the guard to be useless for me. The razor is nice and solidly constructed. I&#x27;ve dropped it in the bath a couple times and it&#x27;s been completely fine. The batteries are very nicely sealed in. The design of the on/off button is designed well enough so you don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally turning the trimmer on when shaving. The only thing that I&#x27;m unsure about is the sharpness of the blades on the razor. I feel like the new Venus blades I have bought in the past have been sharper. This is something I&#x27;m going to have to reassess when I buy a new blade for this Schick razor though.</li>
    <li> Works great! Smooth legs thanks to BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> I love this razor! I got it for free in bzzagent :) really recommend it</li>
    <li> After receiving this razor as part of a promotion, I was excited to try it out. I had used the original Hydro Silk razor in the past and was very impressed. The razor portion of the TrimStyle lives up to the awesome quality of the original. It gives you a super close shave, and leaves your legs super smooth afterwards. Three days after my last shave, and my legs are still pretty smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really unimpressed with the trimmer side. It really doesn&#x27;t give you a close shave, and it makes the overall razor cumbersome. No matter how I held the razor while shaving my legs, I kept poking my hand with the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, love the razor, no love for the trimmer. I&#x27;ll stick with the original Hydro Silk razor.</li>
    <li> I received this free from bzzagent this product is genius. I was rather skeptical using this down there, but I ended up loving it. I will repurchase this. It makes your legs silky smooth after using the razor as well. My only complaint is that the razor get hot really quick especially when I use it on my bikini area. The bikini trimmer is awesome too! Cut just the right amount of with trimmer for a clean look for this upcoming summer! Love the feeling of soft, hair free legs</li>
    <li> I seriously love this razor. I hardly ever buy women&#x27;s razors because I don&#x27;t like the shave it gives. My husband and I buy men&#x27;s razors and split a pack because men&#x27;s razors are what I prefer and they last much longer than women&#x27;s razors. I was sent the trimstyle for review and I was most excited about trying the trimmer more than the razor. To my surprise, the razor works just like a men&#x27;s razor! It gives a very, very close shave. The cartridges are a bit pricey at $18 a pop for 4. If each cartridge lasts a while before getting dull then it might be worth spending $20 (I&#x27;m including taxes).</li>
    <li> Do not buy! Paired with a shaving Creme the moisture stick is super slimy and the Trimstyle does virtually nothing. Knicked myself twice and always get patchy areas.</li>
    <li> First the razor: I liked the built in moisturizer with the razor. I typically use disposables but this was a really nice feature and I didn’t feel like I was getting a serious case of razor burn after. It left a nice close shave and my legs were really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer: Like other reviewers I had no idea the best way to use the trimmer as I had never used one before. I took my best stab at it and it removed lots of hair. It was easy to use and I appreciated that it was water proof so I could use it in the shower.  Would definitely recommend and I look forward to using it again and getting more experienced with the trimmer.</li>
    <li> I thought this razor was fantastic.  I received the product for free through BzzAgent and I will definitely be purchasing the refills to continue using.  I got a wonderfully close shave and the trimmer was fool proof.  The only complaint I have is to be careful with the power button because it is easy to hit, especially when shaving the under arms!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and tops any other razor I have purchased.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for about a month now.  I got it free from bzzagent to write my honesty opinion about the product.&lt;br /&gt;Ever since my first shave, this razor has made my legs and underarms feel silky smooth and amazing! It leaves my legs with NO razor burn (which is huge because I have sensitive skin and razor burn always happens from many different razors).&lt;br /&gt;The gel on the razor head is fantastic, you don&#x27;t even have to use shaving cream!&lt;br /&gt;So if you want your legs silly smooth, I suggest you try this razor! I have a feeling you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have thought of this genius idea! It really is an amazing product! When winter comes to an end, it means swimsuit season is near. The need to maintain from no shave winter begins. This product let me cut the hair with the trimmer and then finish it off with a smooth shave from the 5 blades! I am silky smooth in half the time it normally takes me to get back to bikini ready!</li>
    <li> The first time I used the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor I tried it shaving my legs, underarms and bikini area. The razor, with dual hydrating strips, was wonderful! I didn&#x27;t need to use any soap or shaving cream/gel on my underarms, and minimal on my legs and bikini area. The shave was close, smooth, and easy to use. I&#x27;ve found after a few weeks of almost daily use, the razor still shaves just as close and smooth. I have not needed to change the head. The trimmer was something I&#x27;m not used to, but was hoping to start using more frequently. The first time I tried it on my bikini area I needed to shave it down first, then use the trimmer to get a clean area. I couldn&#x27;t just start with the trimmer, it felt like it was tugging too much, and I did end up getting one very small cut, but that may be from my inexperience with trimmers. The next time I used it, it was much smoother. The handle is easy to hold, and overall it&#x27;s very easy to use and gives a clean, smooth shave and trim!</li>
    <li> i love this razor i got it to try for free thanks to the amazing people at schick and bzzagent.com. all that aside i will be purchasing this in the future. it has a fantastic moisture bar that keeps your legs from being dry and it rele hugs my curves. Real talk for a second the bikini trimmer is great if you just want a trim but if you go bald like me youll be pleased to find the razor side works perfect i had never gotten a nickless ravor shave on my lady bits before this razor better than that i took me hardly anytime at all because the razor was so gently and moved so well with my body that i didnt have to go extra slow or awkwardly position myself to get a great shave.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free to review. Before I got this product I had the quattro that had a trimmer. The razor for that wasn&#x27;t really that great so I just used the trimmer and started using nair. Then I was givin this product to try. The razor was a huge upgrade! The first time I used it my legs felt smoother than they ever have before after shaving and they also felt moisturized. Normally I get those &amp;#34;prickly&amp;#34; hairs growing back around day 3 but when I checked they were still smooth. I&#x27;m now on day 5 and the prickles are just starting to come. The razor as I said was a huge improvement than my previous one but the only thing I have to say is a negative is the trimmer. The one on the quattro was amazing but with this one I have to go over and over again in the same spot in different directions to get it smooth. This would be a perfect 5 star review if it wasn&#x27;t for that.</li>
    <li> I did receive this item free from BzzAgent and Im glad I did not pay for the product as I seem to like what Im use to.  The regular old razor is great for me.  This is just a little to heavy and bulky for me.  As for the trim part of it, it&#x27;s almost useless so It just seems like you should by a single razor instead.</li>
    <li> I #gotitfree from #bzzagent and was honestly reluctant to skip my Gillette and opt to try the new Schick, especially where my bikini area is concerned. I braved it anyways and was pleasantly surprised! I love the convenience of including the trimmer in the handle. It makes grooming a much simpler task. It is not very noisy and produces a clean, smooth shave. I generally have issues with razor burn due to sensitive skin, but didn&#x27;t experience any with the TrimStyle. I am definitely going to consider calling the TrimStyle my new shaving tool for the approaching bikini season. I have complete faith it can handle the job.</li>
    <li> I received toys from bzz agent. The razor looked like the same quality of the regular razors they offer. Which I&#x27;ve always had a decent experience with. What made this exceptional was the dual blades. One electric with different options and closeness. It didn&#x27;t pull any hair or cause any pain. It was a smooth electric shave and was silky smooth afterward. This is great for bikini lines, under arms, or even social hair as well as legs. It&#x27;s a fantastic buy and I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll be cutting from now on.</li>
    <li> As an avid shaver (Typically, I shave AT LEAST every other day.), I was very excited to try this new Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor. I have been buying and using men&#x27;s razors for years, as I think they get a closer shave. I was looking forward to this FINALLY being the razor to bring me back to the world of girly, pretty, purple razors! In all reality, I was fairly disappointed. I didn&#x27;t get a close shave at all, and spend most of the time going over areas I had already shaved. The head kept falling off, (yes, I had it on right.) and the trimmer wasn&#x27;t everything I had hoped for. In the end, it&#x27;s a good backup plan, but in the future I will most likely continue buying men&#x27;s razors for the closest, sexiest, leg-touching shave.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I really like this. And I&#x27;m surprised. Usually I feel like things like this are really hokey and then they don&#x27;t end up working the way they say they will or they&#x27;re not as great as they advertise, but this is extremely handy and works the way it says it would.  The razor is really nice and leaves a really smooth, close shave and it isn&#x27;t irritating like cheap razors can be...leaving razor burn behind. And I mean, it&#x27;s also bikini trimmer so this is kind of uncomfortable to write a review about, lol, but I&#x27;ll just say that it works really well.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought this normally, so I&#x27;m happy I got to try it out!  After trying it, it&#x27;s definitely worth purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I got this for free from BzzzAgent to try and review. **</li>
    <li> I received this free product from Bzz Agent in order to give my unbiased opinion. The packaging was easy to open and the instructions were on the back. I wish they would have included paper instructions so that I didn&#x27;t have to keep the cardboard, but oh well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to consumers - this is a battery operated product. They include your first battery, but you will need 1 AAA battery for future uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the trimmer personally, but I love how the razor feels. It made my legs feel smooth and nourished. Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> This product works amazingly well! I can&#x27;t get over how well the trimmer works along with the razor. I can honestly say I don&#x27;t think I have ever gotten a smoother shave or nicer looking trim. I will never go back to using a disposable razor to take care of my bikini area again. I am a Bzz Agent and recieved this product to test as a promotion from Schick</li>
    <li> I tried the Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle today for the first time. I will start with the trimmer. I personally feel like you have to have quite a bit to trim in your bikini area for this to be the most effective. I did not find it to be something that I would ever use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor side is great. I currently use Schick Hydro Silk disposable razors because of how close of a shave I get. The issue I have with using the Trimstyle for my &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34;razor is how bulky it is. It is awkward to hold and because of that reason I dropped it and the razor blade head popped off...not to mention the huge thud that happened when it hit the shower floor. I think the idea of the trimstyle is great but I think it falls short.  The razor and trimmer should be marketed as two different products. I got this product free from bzzagent</li>
    <li> This little baby is a gem. The razor itself is worth the price. I&#x27;ve never gotten a better,&lt;br /&gt;nicer shave plus it&#x27;s safer than other blades. The risk of cutting myself seems a lot lower than other razors I&#x27;ve used, and I feel confident shaving my underarms, which I can&#x27;t do easily due to poor eyesight.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a promotion for free.  I was able to try the product and then give my honest opinion on how it worked! I absolutely LOVE my new razor!  First of all I hate razor packaging.  It is usually so hard and aggravating to get into it.  I usually have to get the scissors out!  The packaging for this razor was very easy to get in to.  The only negative I guess you could say about the packaging is that the instructions are on the actual box so you could tear them if you just rip into it.  I was able to get a very close shave on my legs and bikini area.  I was very impressed with how well it worked.  I love the fact that it is waterproof and I can use it while I am in the shower.  My legs have never felt smoother.  And my bikini area is ready to rock a swimsuit.  I am sold on the Schick Hydro Silk TrimSyle Razor!  The other razors that I have been using  weren&#x27;t getting close enough and always ended with cuts.  No more nicks and cuts for me!</li>
    <li> I received this free in a promotion.&lt;br /&gt;I have never been more happy for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor isn&#x27;t bulky or hard to handle despite the fact that it does have the trimmer. In fact, I found it extremely easy to handle, especially with the no slip grip. Which means no more fishing disposables out of the drain. It takes one pass to shave the area completely and it&#x27;s large enough that it doesn&#x27;t take forever. The head of the razor swivels you so can really hit the contours of your body quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself is fantastic. Waterproof. One speed. Comes with the guard if you need that sort of thing. Otherwise, it doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull.</li>
    <li> I was in desperate need of a new razor when I had the chance to review this product for free so I was thrilled to see that each razor comes with a standard razor blade in addition to the battery operated trimmer. With swim season approaching, I love that the trimmer can work in or out of water, allowing me the option of doing a quick bikini trim as needed.  The trimmer worked pretty well, though I did find it was more time consuming than just using the blade. However, when trimming and shaping is what is needed, it did a pretty good job. The razor was quite nice, leaving my sensitive skin smooth without any adverse reaction. It did leave some nicks, otherwise I would have given this 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free through BzzAgent and I was so excited to use it! I normally hate shaving my legs and rush through it and end up with cuts using cheap razors but this razor glided so smoothly over my legs and gave me a super close shave. It also worked great on my bikini area. It&#x27;s hard finding a razor that won&#x27;t leave the little red bumps but this one works great. I will definitely buy this in the future!</li>
    <li> OH MY GOODNESS! This razor is incredible. Nice close shave that is awesome, and absolutely no knicks. I highly suggest this product. I never really knew the differences between razors but this one makes me think differently about how good of a shave I can get and that&#x27;s saying something! Awesome product, will use from now on!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a  bzzagent campaign to try this new razor and I am more than pleasantly surprised. The razor and trimmer aspects are really awesome. The trimmer works well for a quick fix, but I do think that it would work best on hair thats longer. The razor is great! I can&#x27;t say anything bad about it, it went around all bony surfaces on the knee and ankle without so much as a knick or bump. My legs are extra smooth right now! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I would definitely recommend this to people to try, especially if you like the shick razors in general.</li>
    <li> i got this as a trial for bzz agent for free and it is amazing  it is so moisturizing and it was soo smooth i will defiantly purchase it</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product for free through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely excited to try the Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle®. I&#x27;ve used Schick refillable razors in the past and have never had an issue with them. They lasted long, were never irritating, and left me with a close shave. However, I have not tried this product, and have never tried a trimmer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the razor itself was amazing. Even with my previous Schick razor being amazing, I still would be left with irritation on my legs and armpits because of my sensitive skin. With the Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle®, it shaved close, and did not leave me with any bumps. The strips were so soothing! This is definitely my new go-to razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next for the trimmer; I loved how there were four settings on the trimmer to determine the length you want to keep. It offers a close trim, or you can keep the hairs longer. I loved being able to have that choice. The trimmer was completely easy to use, and easy to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely recommending this to everyone I know. It&#x27;s so handy having an amazing razor and equally as amazing trimmer in one product. The product itself was so comfortable to hold and use. I love this!</li>
    <li> Love this! Didn&#x27;t buy it on amazon got it through a bzzagent campaign and i love the dual head and different trim settings it makes it a whole lot easier to shave as the blade forms to your curves and the razor makes it easier to trim your bikini i will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> I recieved the Trimstyle as a promotional trial from BzzAgent and wow it really cut my shaving time in half. I was able to precisely trim then shave my bikini area and then shave my legs in no time. It was nice not having to use different tools to achieve what i like. That being said, the razor is super sharp and i took a good chunk out of my ankle but that is really operator error, haha.</li>
    <li> I got this product from Bzzfeed and was so excited to get it in the mail. Little did I know how disappointed I would be with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box I really liked the look of the packaging. It was very appealing and made me more excited to try the product. Then I took out the razor and realized how large and heavy it was. I understand that it needs to hold a battery, but the weight and size made it uncomfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then when I finally got to use the razor/trimmer I was even more disappointed. The trimmer worked, but I would personally only use it before shaving my bikini area if I had been lazy and left it alone for too long. The razor has five blades, which is great, but the moisturizer on it was terrible. As soon as the razor got wet it started dripping this messy goo all over my shower. It also left a very thick layer of goo all over my legs, which was more gross than luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to keep in mind if you use this trimmer is to take it apart when cleaning it. I used it and thought I had thoroughly rinsed it, but then I took it apart and found a ton of hair under the trimmer blade (ew!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I will not be buying (or maybe even using) this product again.</li>
    <li> I just received my Schick hydro from bzzagent and how excited I was!!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. No slimmy feeling from the hydrating serium like some razor. Also, I tap off my razor and this is durable enough to handle that. Oh and it comes with a battery. Can&#x27;t beat that. I had no nicks, no razor burn ( and with five blades I expected razor burn), and no missed spots. The only two things that the hydro Schick silk trim style could change is a holder for the shower and if I some how got a tan while shaving.</li>
    <li> I have been using similar Schick products for years,  but the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle&lt;br /&gt; Razor beats them all. It has been great with my sensitive skin, and I love that I can use the trimmer in or out of the shower. This is overall a great product and brand that I will continue using!</li>
    <li> I received this razor complimentary from Schick for testing purposes.The razor side is great! The razor has a moisture bar attached that does a great job lathering and moisturising while you shave. My legs felt really soft and smooth after I dried my legs as well. The trimmer side didn&#x27;t work so well for me. I had to press the trimmer really hard against my skin to reach the hair and it didn&#x27;t remove any hair. I think you need pretty long hair to use the trimmer side.</li>
    <li> Closet shave my legs have had in YEARS! This razor is perfect for summer that is just around the corner! The seal is tight for the battery, thus no worries about water ruining the razor! The only thing to get used to is the handle thickness, but its nothing that takes away from how close of shave you receive. Also, I love the option that you have for the trimmer, you have the guard and then you can get a closer trim by taking off the guard! I will continue to keep buying replacement heads for this razor which is something I NEVER do!</li>
    <li> Great compact product and easy to use!  Loving that I can use on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> At first I was surprised by the size, I don&#x27;t know why I thought it would&#x27;ve been smaller. Next I used the razor to shave my legs and I have to tell you, I didn&#x27;t think it was going to beat my current razor, but surprisingly enough it was just as good! The shave was close and the head swiveled and adjusted to the nooks and crannies of my body and as I&#x27;m writing this hours later, my legs are unbelievably soft! I can&#x27;t stop rubbing them! Next I used the trimmer, to &#x27;shape up&#x27; and once I got the hang of it, it worked pretty well. My only concern was that there&#x27;s no guideline or illustration that let&#x27;s me know how much gets trimmed at each level, or rather how much gets chopped off</li>
    <li> Amazing!! Love the whole idea and also water proof! Super soft on skin, great blade and everything. Two in one! Extremely great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I received the schick hydro silk trim style razor from bzzagent to test for free! I&#x27;ve always used schick products, they are the best, But this razor has a very close shave and left my legs a bit irritated, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use the trimmer, just not my style.</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome! I received it free from BzzAgent to try out and it works as  promised! I love the 5 blades. It gives a nice smooth shave. Its so soft on my skin and glides nicely up my legs for the perfect shave. The other side features a trimmer. It has 3 adjustable levels for keeping your hair short or long. This too works as promised! Doesn&#x27;t hurt and doesn&#x27;t pull! ALSO It&#x27;s waterproof!</li>
    <li> I recently got this for free in the mail from bzzagent &amp; I am obsessed! Shaving had never been so comfortable before I cant even feel the razor on mu skin, &amp; the trimmer is incredible it takes care of my personal needs.</li>
    <li> WOW! This razor is amazing. The built in trimmer is nice for thinning out the hair before shaving. The razor gave a very smooth shave with little to no irritation. I have used Gillette Venus razors for several years and this performs much better. My only complaint is that it will not hang on a standard razor hook in the shower. Other than that it is a perfect razor and trimmer combo. I am a BzzAgent and this product was provided for free to me to test. This in no way altered my judgement of this product. Thanks to Schick and BzzAgent for the opportunity to test it.</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a trial from Bzzagent. It&#x27;s not for me. It&#x27;s for ladies who want some hair down there. The trimmer has 4 settings and even the lowest setting didn&#x27;t do it for me. The razor blade on the other end is just waiting to slice your hand open. The trimmer didn&#x27;t shave anything even with the setting on its lowest. Great color and great grip.</li>
    <li> Really loved the product. It&#x27;s one of the best 2-in1 products I&#x27;ve ever owned. We&#x27;ve all finished shaving only to discover a few hairs that just won&#x27;t seem to budge no matter how many passes we do over it.  In steps the TrimStyle it gets very close to the surface as possible. The only reason I gave it 4 starts is because I used my favorite shaving cream with it and it was very difficult to get the extra cream out the razor blades.  Other than that awesome product.</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all.  The electric razor doesn&#x27;t work well at all, especially for a close shave.  Better off with a normal razor.I did receive this product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product! I&#x27;ve always shaved with a razor and just got sick of the ingrown hairs and itchy regrowth. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about it anymore! I set it on the 0 setting &amp; it worked great! I received the product as a promotional item and I&#x27;m so grateful I was chosen to test the product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this razor its the most amazing razor ive used its easy and makes your legs feel so smooth you wont have to keep changing your razor all the time you could just stick to this one and youll love it. I didnt buy it from amazon i got it free from buzz agent and i love it!!</li>
    <li> I got this product free through BzzAgent and tested it. I have been using the Schick Hydro Silk for about 2 years now and I thought the blades on this one gave me and even closer shave! I loved that part but don&#x27;t have much need for the trimmer. I let me boyfriend try that and he said it was useful to trim down his chest hair before shaving. He said he liked that it was waterproof and he would definitely use it again. On a 10 point scale he gave it a 9. This is a great razor and Schick has definitely stepped up their game. Would highly recommend for close shaves!</li>
    <li> I received this razor from bzzagent for free to try it out and I really like it I used the Schick Quattro before and this one is a little bigger and has 5 blades. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because It doesn&#x27;t come with the razor holder like the the Quattro does and that was kind of a bummer for me.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I shave about once a day. (which could very well be why I have such sensitive skin) I have tried about a dozen razors with the build in moisturizing strips on them trying to help stop the razor burn. I bought this razor to try the hydrating strip, not so much the trimmer and I have to say it is amazing. I have had no breakout on my legs and I get the smoothest shave every time.</li>
    <li> I love my new Schick hydro silk Trimstyle razor! This razor offers a really close shave first of all and makes shaving really easy and quick. The other thing I like about this is that the handle is actually bigger than most and it makes it have a better grip than most others. The bottom of this razor has a prop so you are able to prop the razor up off the tub and it doesn&#x27;t get stuck down which is awesome and one of my favorite things! Overall I love it and I reccomend this! I got this free from bzzagent</li>
    <li> Love the razor but I am not crazy about the bikini trim side</li>
    <li> I just recieved my freeschick hydro silk trim style from buzz agent to review. I got to say it does leave you legs silky smooth no irratation the only thing is that its a little chuncky to hold the bikini trim i have yet to try out but it has 4 different setting</li>
    <li> I was able to get one of these for free from Schick to try. First off, I was very impressed by the quality and that it came with a battery included. It was easy to use and left my skin feeling very smooth and soft. If you have longer hair I recommend trimming first with scissors as this will save you from having to remove hair every other minute from the razor/trimmer. It did not snag or tug at all which other brands I have tried did. It is lightweight and the moisture strip really helps it to glide.</li>
    <li> Honestly I got this for free to try out from BuzzAgent and I got to say I&#x27;m really happy with it. The razor is fine nothing super special but not by any means bad. The trimmer however really makes this product a 10! I love that its the only tool I need now, and for me at least it worked better on the shorter setting. I would definitely recommend this to others, and it comes with the battery you need to use the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works great for shower shaving and trims.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it! Now I need is to buy the replacement heads. Haha</li>
    <li> Great product. For now I only tried the bikini trimmer end, and it worked good, and it&#x27;s not much a trouble cleaning it either.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing!!#gotitfree to try out and was completely blown away. It has five super sharp blades with two moisturizing strips that make it so you don&#x27;t even need shave gel. It gets a close shave and leaves yor legs moisturized and smooth! I have been able to use the trimmer and it has been so incredibly nice especially with swim suit season and summer here. I am sold and will never wate my money on another razor again!</li>
    <li> I got this razor free to test out from bzz agent.  I was skeptical at first since I am a tried and true Venus razor fan. However I was really excited to try it out. The razor its self is kind of bulky and I was afraid that would affect the shave , however it worked just fine. The shave was actually amazing. I have sensitive skin and usually get razor burn with any razor but my Venus. I did NOT get a razor burn or rash with this razor at all. The trimmer on the end is great weather you like a to trim down to almost nothing or just clean up around the bikini line. I do NOT recommend using the trimmer dry with out the gaurd. It will scratch your skin. I shaved my legs once and waited five days and barely had any stubble!!! Want the best shave of your life? Give this razor a try</li>
    <li> LOVE this razor. The quality is amazing, and the price is even better! I would pay full price for just the trimstyle part, but then it comes with the nicest razor head. It has this cool gel stuff on it that is water activated. It shaves beautifully, no need for shaving cream!</li>
    <li> I absolutely recommend this product to every women out there. I received this as a sample from bzzagent and I&#x27;ll admit I was a little skeptical about it.I&#x27;ve tried products like these in the past and they never give a close shave and leave your skin with horrible razor burn. But I have this product a go and I LOVE IT!!! Made the closest shave and left me with no razor bumps. And I didn&#x27;t need to shave again for a week it was awesome not having to shave everyday like I use to with other razors. This product is going to  name me have one happy summer!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not used to using this type of razor, so when I received this complimentary from bzzagent I was very excited (and nervous!). I love the razor edge. it has a hydrating moisture bar which helps stop razor burns and you don&#x27;t need shaving cream! the razor is awesome and gives a very nice shave. I wasn&#x27;t totally impressed with the clipper side because my hair looked super patchy when I tried using it. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s user error but it seems just sort of hard to use. I&#x27;ll keep practicing!</li>
    <li> I received the Women&#x27;s- Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor from BZZAgent free to try and I will never look at another razor again! I have sensitive skin and I have no cuts, no irritation, nothing from it. I love the trimmer, it has 4 different term lengths which is perfect. I was nervous about using an electric product in the shower but after took it apart and it was still dry! It is a bit bulky, but over all I love it!</li>
    <li> loved this! Can shave legs and bikini area with one razor. I like that the bikini side is adjustable  so that you  can chose how much to take off. What a pleasure it was to try this! I recommend  to any one who wants to take care of all your  shaving  needs in one product .</li>
    <li> This razor is great. Its waterproof and the moisturizing serum is the best. You can customize the length of the trim you are looking for which is perfect. I was a bit scared to use the trimmer at first but its so gentle. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! I got it from Bzzagent to test out and it works amazing! I can shave and trim with only this 1 tool and it&#x27;s great. It gets a really close shave but doesn&#x27;t cause any burn. The only downside is that there is no cover to put onto the razor while using the trimming side. So you have to be careful not to cut yourself if you were to grab it by the wrong spot. The trimmer works great though! It doesn&#x27;t pull or get caught. I really do suggest this razor to anyone looking for something like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and received this razor free as part of a campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the invite, I was a little skeptical. I typically use men&#x27;s disposables for my razors and think they work great. But then I decided that hey, it&#x27;s free, what do I have to lose. So when I got it in the mail and set out to test it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My expectations were correct. Not only was this razor of the same (or maybe slightly poorer) quality than it&#x27;s men&#x27;s counterparts, but it&#x27;s not even on the same quality as the expensive men&#x27;s refillable razors. It&#x27;s the same as the disposables, which are a lot cheaper than 30 dollars for a pack of 5. I find the soap strip makes it easier to nick myself and the bikini trimmer was pretty much useless to me. I used the razor bit for my bikini and got razor burn, which never happens with my regular razors. Overall, I find this product to be a prime example of gendered marketing, where they make the woman&#x27;s products more expensive as less effective than men&#x27;s. I do not intend to buy new cartridges when the current one goes dull. Ladies, save yourself the money and go for the men&#x27;s razors, they work just as well for less!</li>
    <li> This is a high quality trimmer, with an equally awesome razor.  I love that the clipper has an adjustable length and it can all be used in the shower.  This keeps the mess of hair removal all clean and easy.</li>
    <li> I got this as a free product through buzzagent.com, and I would have to say that it was an awesome experience. Nice to be able to have 2 in 1 features, and be able to get ready for the sun in one item. Love it, recommend it! Razor works great with how smooth it leaves your legs.</li>
    <li> I had let things go down there while pregnant and 3 months postpartum. The Trimstyle handled things with ease! Had no issues and was really surprised since I have thick hair.  I plan to continue to use this forever! Seriously. I even shaved part of my head with this since I have a under cut and wanted to save some money.</li>
    <li> Best disposable razor I have ever had. I tried this free from #bzzagent and this is one of the best products I&#x27;ve recieved this far! I love this razor. If you are like me and have kids, there are one thousand bottles in your overcrowded shower. This is an all in one razor, that is easily storable. It can be used for an all over body shave including my favorite part, bikini trimming. There is a safety guard too/second length guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to figure out how the battery goes in and out of it pretty quickly. It has a strip one of those hydrating strips that is awesome! I&#x27;ve been using the same head for over a month and I can still get an awesomely close shave with no shaving cream. My skin is super sensativr so I haven&#x27;t gotten any razor burn or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom bikini trimmer did break unfortunatly, but for the value of $10 at Walmart, I will absolutely buy one again! Recommend this product 100%%</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor is amazing, and to say I LOVE it is an understatement. It has cut my shaving routine in half in the mornings, and I love that I can touch up areas without water! I admit, I have never used a &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; before, but thanks to Google and Youtube, it was pretty easy to figure out. I haven&#x27;t felt as moisturized or beach ready in years! Thanks Schick!</li>
    <li> I received this for free through BzzAgent, however this review is my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I&#x27;m not in a relationship, I like to keep things cleaned up down there. I also abhorre shaving my legs, but I know it&#x27;s a necessary part of being a girl. A social acceptable one that is. Plus I do actually like the feeling of smooth legs. This tool is great as it is double ended and can take care of both things.&lt;br /&gt;First the trimmer. It has a couple of different lengths, however, I really only used the shortest length because that is what I like. You can use it on dry or wet hair, which is nice if you just want to trim and not have to get into the bathtub, or shower, or whatever. The blade is sharp enough to clip the hair, but I never felt in any danger of getting cut. Which is important when we&#x27;re talking about my lady business. It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to maneuver. The only downside I will say is it is pretty loud. However, it&#x27;s also great that it has a tight seal, so you aren&#x27;t in danger of getting an electrical shock from using a battery operated tool in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the razor part. I already use Schick products so I knew that I would like the razor. It&#x27;s great that if I want I can just shave with some water and not have to worry about razor burn. It works great with some shaving cream, but sometimes I don&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle of that or I&#x27;m in a hurry. It&#x27;s also replaceable, which only makes sense since it&#x27;s a multi ended tool. Overall this is a great product, and honestly the only downside I can find, is that the buzzing is pretty noisy.</li>
    <li> I NEVER use shaving cream. With this razor you don&#x27;t need too. It doesn&#x27;t pull or give razor burn. I coupon and always have tons of razors but I still prefer this one! NEVER GOING BACK!</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing! It leaves your skin feeling smooth. I don&#x27;t get irritation because of the moisturizing serum and it actually leaves my skin feeling hydrated. I get a close shave that curves to my body, with the razor having 5 blades. I like that it has bikini trimmer attached, so I can just go from shaving to trimming my bikini area! It&#x27;s so easy to use and not complicated! It has an adjustable comb so I can choose how close of a trim I want. Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> I got this razor free from BzzAgent and was super excited to try it.  It is an amazing razor, but the trim side was either to long or too short for me.  I will continue to buy the refills for the razor side though.  The moisturizer strip kept you moisturized, but also lasted for many many shaves and I shave daily.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shied away from trimmers, mostly because I was terrified to use them and because of the price. (Probably just as terrified as when I first used a razor come to think...) I got this product free from BzzAgent and was eager to try it out! This was super easy to use and I LOVE it! The three different lengths you can trim are amazing as I hate going hairless down there, but I do need to make sure it looks clean. I&#x27;ve used it on my happy trail and will definitely continue to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is excellent. I already have a similar razor which is my go-to for my vajayjay in the event that I want all the hair gone because it leaves my skin smooth and takes away all my hair while still moisturizing. LOVE LOVE LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when I thought I couldn&#x27;t love Schick razors more!!!</li>
    <li> The best razor for Summer! It will not cut you or leave bumps and it is very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I saw the commercial for this many times but never thought of actually buying it because I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work so well. But it&#x27;s absolutely AMAZING! It really leaves my skin so silky and very smooth! You really don&#x27;t need any shaving cream. As for the trimming side; it works wonderfully!!! I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> My husband and I absolutely love this razor. It has all on-board tools in one place to keep me looking my best during the summer bikini months and even tackles the tougher &amp;#34;man scaping&amp;#34; jobs I&#x27;ve caught my husband using my razor for…shhh, don&#x27;t tell anyone I&#x27;m saying he uses it. The razor itself provides superior hydration with every stroke and leaves no razor burn since one stroke is all that is necessary with those five wonderful blades. The bikini clipper even has a guard to ensure my grooming is just the way i like it. I absolutely love the fact that it is completely water proof so i have no fear of destroying another clipper in my shower. Schick, I do not know how you come up with such amazing products, but I am a lifetime user of them all! I highly encourage all ladies to give this razor a shot, it will not let you down!</li>
    <li> I received this razor thanks to BzzAgent for free testing purposes! Really. It&#x27;s changed shaving forever! The 5 blades allow for a close, smooth shave and no Knicks or razor burn here! The electric side is amazing!! Love that it has 3 different settings depending on how close of a shave you desire, it&#x27;s water proof, and let&#x27;s be honest; makes it easy to groom when you&#x27;ve gone a week or two without touching up. Lol. Everyone needs this razor in their lives!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the other leading brand trimmer razors and was satisfied so when the chance to try this product for free from BzzAgent opened to me, I was super excited to give it a try. So far I&#x27;m in love with this razor. The trimmer doesn&#x27;t pull unlike the other brands I&#x27;ve tried. The razor also gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I would and will be purchasing more refills of this wonderful trimmer razor!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best razor I have come across. I received it as a buzz agent to try and I am AMAZED!! My legs are stop smooth after I shave and it doesn&#x27;t leave the horrible stumble feeling of some razors. The bikini trimmer is easy to use and accurate so no weird issues. What&#x27;s even better is its 2 products for the price of 1 and so much easier to keep up with!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor! I got this for free to try through BzzAgent, but I had already been a fan of shick razors. I get a close and clean shave that leaves me smooth for quite a while! It glides so easily across my skin and I never have to worry about getting nicked!</li>
    <li> Received as a free gift from BzzAgent!&lt;br /&gt;I have had this razor for about a month now and have used it about 4 times. Especially with the warmer weather.  I usually only buy the cheaper razors I&#x27;m excited when I actually get a more expensive one. But after all the razor burns I wanted to try a better one.&lt;br /&gt;The razor felt a little heavy which Is to be expected if it&#x27;s both a trimmer and a razor and holds a battery I guess. I was excited so the first thing I tried was trimming my sideburns. A regular razor takes forever. It did a great job!&lt;br /&gt;Then on to shaving my winter coat off my legs. I noticed using this razor seemed to be better without shaving cream. It leaves such a nice smooth shave. I absolutely felt like it&#x27;s the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Very close shave. Baby smooth skin and no razor rash. The razor last forever and justifies paying more.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product all around. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> Great razor, good price but wish it came with an extra razor blade replacement.</li>
    <li> Loved the razor part! Such a smooth shave and no nasty razor burn!  Unfortunately not a fan or the trimmer :( I feel like it would be great for trimming long hair, but I keep my areas regularly trimmed and it just didn&#x27;t do anything for the already short hairs.  (I got this product as a free sample)</li>
    <li> I received this &#x27;Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor&#x27; FREE through BzzAgent.com for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the Schick Hydro Silk (TrimStyle) works great! Love the style of this razor, I think it&#x27;s neat looking. This razor leaves your skin soft/ smooth after using it, at least for me it does. My legs definitely get the feeling that they&#x27;re moisturized. Overall, I give it 5/5 of a rating because it works so well, it&#x27;s just a great razor. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my experience with this product. As someone who values efficiency, I was excited that a product offered both a trimmer and razor in one. I got a chance to sample this product using BzzzzAgent, and it was amazing. I would recommend this to anyone looking to show of their legs for bikini season.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it once so far, but it was very easy to figure out. The packaging was easy to open and eye-catching. I loved the blue theme. There was a battery included for the trimmer, which excited me because many times you have to purchase your own batteries. From there I tried the power button just to see how it worked.&lt;br /&gt;When using it with shaving cream I found the trimming head glided smoothly through. The trimmer has three different available lengths with the guard. Options are always great.  When I used the razor it was the smoothest shave I’ve had in a long time, and I’ve tried many brands of razors. I loved that there were five razor blades. I was so excited at how silky smooth my legs felt afterward.&lt;br /&gt;As someone who wears short shorts for an athletic sport (I play roller derby), a great shave is important to me. I would definitely purchase this product again, and will recommend it to friends.  The end result is amazing, and the best part is that it’s a 2-in-1 product, and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I didnt buy my razor from amazon. I got mine free in the mail from bzzagent! I love love love my razor! I always nic my knees when shaving with my old razors but not with this one! The 5 curve sensing blades are awesome and give you a nice smooth shave! The bikini trimmer i found easier to use out of the shower but i love it also! Its nice if you are in a hurry and need to get out the door fast for a last min pool day! :)</li>
    <li> I have to say I absolutely LOVE this razor. I have an older version of this razor I purchased a few years ago and I liked that when I found out I would receive one to try from BzzAgent I figured I would love the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor as well, but I didn&#x27;t expect that the differences made would make all the differences for me. Everything I hated about my old razor was fixed with this one so as a result I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed upon taking it out of the box is that this razor is SO much easier to grip. The entire handle is grippy and much more comfortable to hold on to plus it is so much easier to open up this razor to change the battery. I have had to struggle to change the battery with my old old one, so while this seems like a small thing it&#x27;s actually a VERY big deal for me. I would actually hold off on changing the battery before because it was such a hassle for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the actual razor. I decided to be brave, and not use any shaving gel so I could see how the moisture strip on the razor itself did. I had the shaving gel on hand just in case and I was prepared for blood. But there was none, I got the closest shave I&#x27;ve probably gotten in a long time and my legs definitely felt moisturized. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be this brave every time, but it&#x27;s great to know the razor does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the trimmer exceeded expectations as well. My previous trimmer didn&#x27;t have a comb attached to it and I have to say that makes all the difference. I keep it on the lowest setting and it gets the job done the first time.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I love this razor, it&#x27;s making shaving my legs fun!</li>
    <li> First, let me start off by saying that the razor on this thing is AMAZING!! I did the first swipe and thought it was just like a regular razor, then the moisturizing serum kicked in. WOW!! You can&#x27;t even feel the shave at all!! It is nothing like I have ever felt while shaving haha. (Though, I must warn you that the serum kind of looks funny and it did catch me off guard) Now for the trimmer. Personally, I shave my bikini area, so I found the razor unnecessary. That being said, again, using this razor to shave my bikini area was awesome! I&#x27;m serious, I have never had a better razor. Summarized, the razor is huge! The trimmer is unnecessary, but the shave is SPECTACULAR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive the razor free as a product review!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle for free courtesy of Schick and Bzz Agent. It gave me an extremely close shave, I was very impressed.  The only downfall was the handle is much larger than a regular size razor and I thought that made it alot more difficult to use in the bikini area that it is designed for.</li>
    <li> Love this razor. I usually stay away from razors with &amp;#34;moisture strips&amp;#34; as I have very sensitive skin and they usually make it worse causing a rash or bumps but not this products. Soft skin and a smooth shave with NO rash, YEAH!!! Thanks for finally creating a product that I can use without fear of rash, bumps or nicks. I really love the pivot head for knees no more nicking on my fat knees. The bikini trimmer works great it cuts/trims not pulls the hair out!</li>
    <li> Super SMOOTH!  I was lucky enough to get this razor as a promotion from Schick.  The blades were very sharp and provided a close shave; however, I was most impressed by the &amp;#34;water-activated moisturizing serum&amp;#34; strip.  Previous blades I&#x27;ve used with this type of strip were moisturizing for a few shaves, but then quickly dried out.  This one was very thick and almost questioned my need for shaving cream.  I wish it came with a shower holder, but I really liked the design of the handle that makes it so the head of the razor doesn&#x27;t touch the surface if you put it down, especially with the moisturizing strip being so thick (no sticky messes on the edge of your tub).  Normally I hate the bikini trimmer that comes with these razors, but this one was actually effective.  I probably won&#x27;t find much use for the trimmer attachment because I personally choose to be less...um...&amp;#34;bushy,&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing strip&lt;br /&gt;Handle design&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer giving you a close trim&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;No shower holder&lt;br /&gt;Slightly heavy</li>
    <li> I love that the trimmer is included with the razor.  Thank you</li>
    <li> So happy I was able to test out this product for free! It is truly amazing. No cuts, no bleeding, so convenient, and easy to use. I will definitely buy another in the future! I was always looking for a bikini shaving product that is safe on my sensitive skin and I finally found it. Never thought I could be so happy from a razor!!!!</li>
    <li> Does what it says and gives a nice close shave, but beware things not advertised! The moisture activated gel induces a tingling sensation that may or may not be pleasant depending where you&#x27;ve used it. And because it&#x27;s moisture activated, I&#x27;d keep it out of the shower when not in use. Received free as part of a promo from the brand and BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I have been a Gillette girl my entire life. I found the Schick Intuition Razor to be the worst razor I have ever used, which deterred me from any Schick products thereafter. But my most recent razor, the Gillette Venus Spa, was the second worst razor I&#x27;d ever used. I wanted to buy a new razor, but ended up taking a detour to try out epilation (didn&#x27;t work out) and at-home waxing (OUCH! that burn, those blisters, that fail). My legs weren&#x27;t smooth enough for me, so I desperately needed a new shaving razor before spring and summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cue the Hydro Silk TrimStyle! I got one for free from the BzzAgent campaign. This has been my all-time favorite razor to date, which is saying a lot. I love how close of a shave it gets, and the fact that it has a bikini trimmer is an amazing addition that I never knew I needed or even wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave I get is so close that I can actually skip a day and still have incredibly smooth skin, which has NEVER happened before. The moisturizing strip does have an unusual consistency, but it has saved me from cuts since I use soap lathers as shaving cream. The bikini trimmer portion  works well with no tiny cuts and an even trim, especially considering that I have really thick hair. The Hydro Silk TrimStyle is battery operated and completely waterproof, but I&#x27;d recommend not keeping it in the shower to save the moisturizing strip&#x27;s abilities, since they are water activated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR: Overall, it&#x27;s an incredible product that is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ll update my review once I&#x27;ve had it for a longer while)</li>
    <li> I was not sure if this product would be a good one for me but I was wrong. It was easy to set up and if even came with a battery...super cool! I had a good shave and no discomfort ...I would highly recommend to others for a close shave.</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a BzzAgent campaign to try for free!  I love it and I won&#x27;t go back.  It is so nice and convenient to have the razor and trimmer on one device and I love that the trimmer is waterproof.  I would definitely recommend and purchase again.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free from BzzAgent to try about a month ago and I use it almost daily now. This is something that I will buy from now on. It gives a nice close shave and leaves my skin soft. It has five blades and the electric shaver which is also fantastic. I used to use a previous trim shaver and this is much better!</li>
    <li> I really love this razor. I&#x27;ve never used a razor that also had the bikini trimmer on it also so I wasn&#x27;t sure how I was going to like it. I love that you can use this razor in the shower and I love how smooth my skin is after using this razor. The bikini trimmer really cuts your time in half and is so convinent to use. The razor is easy to clean and use. Definitely my favorite razor. I would recommend this to everyone. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I received this free through Bzzagent and I love it! This razor is phenomenal! I&#x27;ve always used Gillette Venus before but this is by far better! Always leaves my skin silky smooth and super soft! I love that the battery operated piece is waterproof so it makes shaving with it much easier!</li>
    <li> I usually get male razors because the normal girl ones seem to not shave the way I like. This one was excellent! It got hairs my usual razor missed including the thinner hairs. I was able to use both sides to get a great shave. You have the option to trim hair vs shaving it all off. I chose all of course. Another great aspect of the razor is it still hasn&#x27;t rusted whereas my usual shavers usually start getting rust colorings after about 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great new product from Schick that I was able to get for free for being a bzz agent</li>
    <li> I received this from BzzAgent as a promotion. The razor side of this item is amazing, it&#x27;s what I have used since it came out. However, the trimmer just did not work for me in the shower no matter which angle I tried, the trimmer just did not cut the hair. Maybe if you keep your hair a bit longer this would be a good option, but for me it simply did not work. The razor side is amazing, though!</li>
    <li> This razor has 5 blades, which helps with irritation and preventing it. It is a 2-in-1, so it saves space and you can get the job done faster without having to fiddle around with two separate razors. One of the best things about this razor is that it is water-activated with conditioner that moisturizes your skin while shaving. What other type of razors do you know that do that? I received this from BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I hate shaving. My skin is so dry that it hurts to shave. Waxing isn&#x27;t an option because of the dry skin and cream removal products give me burns. So what&#x27;s a girl to do? I tried the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini trimmer and I am....in love! The no slip grip offers an easy of shaving without the worry you&#x27;ll &#x27;slip up&#x27;. The moisture strips actually moisturize and my skin didn&#x27;t burn at all. Shaving my legs, armpits and bikini area has never been so easy and painless. The razor gives a smooth shave on every part of my body and the trimmer makes it simple to clean up for bathing suit season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a product free for review from BzzAgent. All opinions are my own and 100% honest.*</li>
    <li> I was skeptical....but this razor is just what I was looking for! Nice size and handleability. It&#x27;s going on my repeat buying list.</li>
    <li> Love love love! Cuts my shower time in half, two tools in one! Never going back to the regular schick!!!</li>
    <li> I recently received a free Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® razor as part of a BzzAgent campaign but this review is based 100% on my own experience.  I have to admit I was a bit concerned because I have sensitive skin in some of those &amp;#34;certain&amp;#34; areas &amp; even when using razors labeled as &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34;, I would still wind up breaking out in a rash &amp; developing painful in-grown hairs.  I have used other Schick Hydro Silk razors in the past &amp; I have to say this razor lives up to the Schick name.  I was pretty impressed with this 2-in-1 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the pros on the trimmer - 1.) on one end you have the battery operated trimmer that has an adjustable comb 2.) There are 4 different settings - 3 with the comb on &amp; 1 with the comb off (for the closest trim).  I started out with the comb at the longest setting &amp; then eventually removed the comb.  3.) When the blades touched my skin, it still gave me a smooth shave &amp; didn&#x27;t get my skin caught/pinched in the trimmer.  4.) It&#x27;s waterproof!  Being it runs on battery power, you don&#x27;t need to worry about getting the razor wet in the shower.  5.) It also has the same rubber grip handle we have all become accustomed to with the Schick Hydro Silk brand razors so there was no problem for me holding on to the razor with wet hands.  Some of what I guess you might call cons (which aren&#x27;t many) - 1.) Not sure what kind of battery life it will have 2.) The trimmer is not replaceable so once the trimmer gets dull, eventually you will have to buy a full replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the actual razor, some pros are - 1.) After you get the hair trimmed, you conveniently turn the razor around &amp; VIOLA!!  You have a Schick Hyrdo Silk 5-blade razor on the other end with the moisture strips that you can use to finish up those delicate areas or to shave the usual legs, underarms, etc.  2.) It has a little stand on the handle to it will sit nicely when you set it down on your counter top.  3.) They claim that the blades are &amp;#34;curve-sensing&amp;#34; blades so it can provide you with the closest shave while reducing skin irritation.  4.) So far when using the Hydro Silk razor end, I have not experienced any rashes, in-grown hairs, etc.  5.) When using this portion of the razor I used the Skintimate Shaving gel I purchased using one of the coupons that came with my BzzAgent kit.  Being that I was already a familiar user of Skintimate Shaving gel, I already knew that I would have no irritation problems resulting from the gel shaving cream &amp; as I did with the trimmer, the razor also delivered a nice, smooth shave, even in the delicate areas. 6.) The 5-blade razor cartridge can be replaced with any Schick Hydro Silk razor cartridge which means you won&#x27;t have to buy a replacement as often.  7.) Being a 2-in-1 saves me one less device cluttering up my shower caddy.  As far as cons go with the actual razor, I can&#x27;t really think of any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was very happy with this product &amp; would recommend trying it.  Because I&#x27;ve only had this razor for a short time, I&#x27;m not sure yet what type of lasting power the battery will have.  As for price, the lowest I&#x27;ve seen them sell for so far is $13.99 which isn&#x27;t a bad price at all considering the amount of product you get &amp; the fact that one regular razor these days can run you $10+.;curve-sensing&amp;#34; blades so it can provide you with the closest shave while reducing skin irritation.  4.)

    <li> The Schick HydroSilk TrimStyle is an excellent bathroom tool. I received the TrimStyle for free as a BzzAgent, and since I already use HydroSilk disposable razors, I had an idea of the performance of the razor. The razor gives a close, smooth shave, even using body wash as a lubricant on my legs (I use shave gel for underarms). The moisturizing strip lasts for about 2 weeks for me. The bottom moisturizing strip got a bit &amp;#34;snotty&amp;#34; after a few uses, possibly from being in the shower without a razor cover. The disposable razor has a cover for the blades; the TrimStyle does not (unless I accidentally threw it out with the packaging). This could be problematic if you have small kids. The TrimStyle does not have a hook to hang it on the wall, which probably would not work since it&#x27;s a bit heavy, but a built-in nub to sit it horizontally on a shelf so that the razor isn&#x27;t resting directly against a surface. The trimmer worked great for me - the thin width helped me neatly trim my lady bits, and it was nice to use it &amp; clean off the trimmer right in the shower, due to it being waterproof. I prefer the weight of the HydroSilk disposable for shaving my legs, but love the trimmer.</li>
    <li> I received this for free from BzzAgent.  The handle is really big and semi awkward to hold.  Bulky due to holding a battery.  The razor end that I use to shave my legs does not have a cover so the moisturizer strip disappears quickly.  Also, the blades need to be replaced and they are not cheap.  I like the trimmer and it does work well when wet.  And nice to not need 2 razors to do one job.</li>
    <li> Love this combo leaves your legs soft and Smooth and trims your binki  area great .it don&#x27;t pull you hair out it has adjustable lengths for you to use depending how short you wanti got to try the razor and trimmer as a promotion</li>
    <li> I love that it is waterproof!  I was able to shave my legs and trim my bikini area while in the shower!  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it didn&#x27;t have a cap for the razor so the moisturizer melted off within 2 showers.  But the shave is still amazing!</li>
    <li> This razor by shick is awesome! I have been using a men&#x27;s razor for so long I didn&#x27;t realize what a mistake I was making. This razor is so smooth on the skin and gets such a great shave! I&#x27;m impressed and won&#x27;t be going back to a men&#x27;s razor after using the shick hydro silk trim style razor! The water activated moisturizing serum does wonders on the legs and it last for a great amount of time! Thank you shick hydro silk for bring me back to a great razor!</li>
    <li> This is the only razor that I plan on using now. I never liked refillable razors, but this shave was extremely close and the trimmer on the other end was an added bonus! I received it as a free sample with a few coupons and I didn&#x27;t think I would like it but I only had to go over hair once (twice a few times) and it was great! The trimmer was hard for me to use at first but I loved it by the end!</li>
    <li> The handle is a little bulky, but the razor works great! The hydrosilk in the head, gives you a very smooth shave. I didn&#x27;t use the trimmer much, but actually my fiance did, and he liked it! lol I would recommend this for a good smooth shave.. not for daily touch ups. I received the product as a promotion from the brand, but wanted to give some honest feedback, for those who may want to check it out!</li>
    <li> I got a free Schick Hydro Silk Trimmer free to try out. I&#x27;ve seen the commercial for this trimmer/razor &amp; thought &#x27;yeah, trimming topiary seems pretty easy but this thing will never be easy to use like that on yourself!!&#x27;. With some time &amp; lots of patience, I can actually admit I was wrong!! It really was that easy to use on yourself!! The razor portion works wonderfully to give silky smooth results without having to use shaving cream or gel. With sensitive skin myself I was sure I&#x27;d get razor rash or razor burn, I was even more delightfully thrilled to see that even after several uses, I still ended up with silky smoothness wherever I used this!! I thought it&#x27;d be difficult to say Goodbye to my old reliable Venus razors but after using this Schick razor/trimmer, I was happy to say &#x27;Hello Schick &amp; Goodbye Venus&#x27;!!</li>
    <li> I got this as a free product to try and I have to say I was pretty impressed. Normally, I stick strictly to Gillette razors, but this razor held its own. I like that it&#x27;s a 5 blade system. It feels comfortable in your hands and the trimmer works really well. I would recommend this to anyone who trims their bikini area.</li>
    <li> Received the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle through BzzAgent, and have had the smoothest legs since using this razor!  It leaves them feeling like silk every time.  The 5 blade system works wonderfully and is surrounded by the most amazing skin conditioner. The handle is easy to maneuver in the shower our out. The trimmer is awesome with 4 adjustable settings! Would totally purchase and recommend to family and friends!  My husband has also commented on how my &amp;#34;pine tree&amp;#34; legs now are soft and smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind!</li>
    <li> I got this product for free a few days ago from BzzAgent to try it and give an honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I opened the box I for some crazy reason, couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get into it. I ended up ripping it open, only to realize the directions were on the part that I ripped opened. UGH! I quickly found out that I really didn&#x27;t need them. Upon opening I was pleased to see that it came with a battery and I wouldn&#x27;t have to hunt one down. I couldn&#x27;t wait to jump in the shower and try it out. When I started shaving I immediately noticed that it was very hard to grip. My hands are average size for any female. It slipped out of my hand 5 times, just on the first leg. After getting annoyed and finishing up, I realized that it would be very beneficial for them to create a piece so this razor to hang in the shower. It does have a great little piece that keeps your fingers from slipping forward and getting cut and also keeps the blade from sitting in water, which I love. the next day, I decided to try this as a bikini trimmer. AWESOME! I think it eliminates the need for a separate bikini razorThis razor is great for the fact that it give a very close shave and that it is two pieces in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up the review: very close shave, wonderful electric bikini trimmer, 2-in-1 product, great finger stopper/stand, too bulky to keep a steady grip, needs a piece to hang in shower.</li>
    <li> The razor is quality! I was happy to try it out when I received it free for testing purposes through BzzAgent. I am confident with knowing my legs receive the closest shave, leaving my legs smooth. The bikini trimmer is such an added bonus and will definitely come in handy during summer!</li>
    <li> Not great, but it works. I&#x27;ve had this product a fairly short time and the electric trimmer part is rusting already :(</li>
    <li> Excellent product but with one major flaw! I bought this after googling the best bikini shavers. This was very easy to use. There is a prop built in to hold the razor off the counter so that it can dry properly. Very well thought out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However!! I have now had to buy 3. These things drain the battery it comes with very quickly, and after the battery dies, so does the shaver! No replacement battery will bring it back from the dead. The solution I&#x27;ve found is to remove the battery after each use. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> This is the best best razor I ever used I was really worried about it because people left negative feed back about this product  for no reason this is such a great razor this will be the only one I&#x27;ll ever use please don&#x27;t let negative people stop you from getting this really great razor.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing razor and trimmer! I like that the razor has five blades and a moisturizing serum to make your legs smooth. I also love the bikini trimmer. It works better than any other razor I have tried that had one. It is very well made and I know that it will last a long time! I received the trimmer free thanks to a promotion the brand was having.</li>
    <li> So excited I got this product for BzzAgent and Schick to try for FREE just to give my honest opinion about my experience..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So first thing I love the size and packaging of this product!  Very bright and cheery.  I was shocked by the weight of this item - it&#x27;s a very fancy, fun razor for sure.  It looks like every thing you need in one awesome package.  Just a small hint -  to install the battery you must twist the middle to add the battery and it&#x27;s great as you can change the battery just like you change the blades!  Okay so I am all ready to go..  So simple to use you just push the blue button and you are on and ready to get beach smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets talk about the razor - it&#x27;s so smooth and easy to use.  Love the feeling and ease of use.  No pulling and no snagging along the way just an easy smooth glide up my leg leaving smooth clean skin behind.  The width of the razor cuts down on the time it takes to shave and seriously it&#x27;s the smoothest shave I have ever had!  I am in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No the Bikini side - WOW - I love having both in one place!  Again the size is perfect and makes getting a smooth bikini line super easy and not painful at all!  I am a faithful waxer because I have yet to find a razor that would leave your skin smooth - until now - I am going to forgo waxing this spring and use this razor exclusively and I think I will be just as happy and have extra money for a brand new bikini to show off my super smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO I guess it&#x27;s safe to say I recommend this razor with 5 STARS!</li>
    <li> Received this product to test out thanks to BzzAgent! I&#x27;ve used it twice, and it is just what I needed to get ready for shorts weather! The razor has a great hydrating strip surrounding it, for a close shave that left my legs feeling great afterwards. It was comfortable to hold, and maneuvered well around tough spots like my ankles and knees. I did not need the trimmer side, but I caught my fiancee using it on his face to trim his beard before work! He said it worked well, but would probably work better on less coarse hair. He thought it was great that it was waterproof, and already attached to a razor. I may need to invest in a second one so I don&#x27;t need to share :)</li>
    <li> I got this as a free item to try from BzzAgent and I was excited to give it a try as I do like the Schick products. I really liked the packaging and I loved the color of the razor. It felt like it had a bit of weight to it when I held it in my hand, but it wasn&#x27;t too heavy and I really liked how sturdy it felt. I tried the razor first and I was very impressed with how great it worked. It gave a nice, close shave and left my legs feeling silky smooth. I tried the bikini trimmer next. While it worked well, I had some issues with it. It felt a bit clunky to use and I really didn&#x27;t like the fact that I had to hold the button down to keep it on while using it. I feel that having a switch or button that would turn it on and turn it off would have worked better. Overall, I like the razor very much, but the bikini trimmer needs work.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever used!!&lt;br /&gt;My body is very sensitive to razors. I almost always end up with those unsightly little red razor bumps. I tried this razor out yesterday when I received it in the mail from bzzagent, free might I add, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much out of it because shaving is always a nightmare for me. I just can&#x27;t stand those annoying, itchy bumps. But I tried this one without using cream or conditioner because the box claimed &amp;#34;hypoallergenic moisturizing serum and unique skin guards protect against irritation.&amp;#34; No bumps!! I can&#x27;t believe it!! And the way it curves and contours with your body just makes it even better. I didn&#x27;t have to constantly go over the same areas again and again. Shaving took no time, and the trimmer was an added benefit. I personally used it without the guard, but it has options available if you&#x27;d prefer not to go that low. The guard is simple to put on and adjust, you just click it down. And taking it off is just has simple. I will definitely keep using these!! Schick has won me over with this one. I can definitely see this coming in good use for the beach or pool as well, as the trimmer can be used in and out of the shower. ++++!!!!</li>
    <li> I just received this product and loved it!  I have sensitive skin and this razor left no visible sign of irritation, nor do I feel any!  The waterproof trimmer worked great!  I had some difficulty removing all hair with the razor.  I had to take several passes in some areas.  I highly recommend this razor to anyone with sensitive skin!  It&#x27;s easy to hold onto as it has a gel grip.  It&#x27;s size is intimidating at first, but you soon realize it&#x27;s incredibly easy handle.  I did notice it was just a slight bit hard to maneuver into the harder to reach areas.  All in all, I give it 4 stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying this: I&#x27;ve never been fully convinced either way (to have a full bush or nothing at all). I think it is a matter of preference. I like it short so it doesn&#x27;t itch. I have frequently tried just using a razor, but that leaves painful bikini bumps. Razors are inefficient for that anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Razor: I like it a lot! I&#x27;ve never bought such a fancy razor before and I am impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shaver: 100% yes! This IS the answer. No bikini bumps. If you are looking for full removal this is not for you. But if you like it very  short, this is perfect!</li>
    <li> I love this razor it is amazing.I get a super close shave and the trimmer is great for the obvious  bikini line.my boyfriend has even mentioned possibly &amp;#34;losing&amp;#34; mine so he can use it to clean up his edges.</li>
    <li> Just love this Razor! Super clean, close shave along with great moisturizing! Makes shaving bikini area much easier!  #GotItFree @shickhydrosilk</li>
    <li> Thanks to bzzagent I was able to try this product. Overall it&#x27;s a great razor. I don&#x27;t think my legs have ever been smoother. The blades feel a lot sharper than any other razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I had to be very carful going over my knees not to cut myself. I would defiantly recommend this to anyone looking for a new razor! But I would recommend not leaving it in the shower.</li>
    <li> i love that this razor does everything.  you can use it in your bikini area but i use mine for brows and straggly chin hairs lol.  absolutely love it and will be buying this from now on.  i did receive this to try out for free and review.</li>
    <li> I got this product thanks to BzzzzAgent. It was sent as a free product to try out and give my honest opinion.I absolutely loved the razor! It&#x27;s moisturizing 5 blade razor head gave me the smoothest shave I think I have ever had,The five blades really did what it said they would and I got a nice clean, smooth, no red bumps shave. I have recomended Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle to all my sister in laws,</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle for free in return for my opinion on the product from BzzAgent. I have to say, I love it! The razor was a really close, smooth shave and the trim side is very convenient. I am used to a smaller razor (BIC Soleil disposables) so this was a little bit bulky to me at first but I did get used to the size and there does have to be room inside for a battery to work for the trim side (so it&#x27;s not unnecessarily large). The trim side also has different settings to make it as close of a shave as you would like. Overall, I really like this! The only downside for me is the size but again, it&#x27;s not unnecessary just hard for me to get used to.</li>
    <li> First off thank you BuzzAgent for letting me try this product out for free. When I tried Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® the instructions were on the inside of the box where is a horrible location. The 2 in 1 unit as a whole was heavy and uncomfortable to hold. When I started to use it on the shower my hand slipped a few times due to how slippery the surface was. The razor porton was horrible, I didn&#x27;t get a close shave like my normal razor I use. The trimmer was time consuming and and  for it to work as needed you need to have ALOT of hair in the needed area.  Using the trimmer also made the bikini area red for 30 minutes after. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product in the store. Also, you don&#x27;t get any extra blades with the kit like a normal new razor. You typical at least get 1 extra razor blade.</li>
    <li> 4 stars for how bulky, but otherwise I absolutely love this. I received mine from BzzAgent as a test product and I couldn&#x27;t have made a better choice. Leaves my legs feeling smooth and moisturized after every shave, the trimmer works great and doesn&#x27;t pull. I would DEFINITELY buy another, should mine need replaced! I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> I received the TrimStyle free as part of a promotion from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;In all honestly it&#x27;s more the razor that deserves the 3 star than the trimmer. The trimmer is seriously genius. It&#x27;s waterproof which is amazing, trimming in the shower is handy and cuts down on clean up. I love that it has an adjustable comb. Everybody has their preferences for down there and this gives ladies plenty of options.&lt;br /&gt;The down side though is that I just did not find the razor all that great. The shave on my legs was fairly smooth, but not the best I&#x27;ve ever had. On my underarms it kind of hurt, it felt like it was catching or something, so I was nervous as I shaved and doubt I&#x27;ll use it there again. As for my bikini line I think it worked pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Another annoying thing was the little white knobbies that kind of grow with the water ( I think they&#x27;re there to keep things smooth) just continued swelling and kind of stuck to the surface where I had set the razor, and I set it down flat like I was supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;So if the razor was better this thing would be so perfect, but it honestly might be worth it to buy it just for the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I think that the Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle razor is the best! I hate having to get in the shower for my legs, get out for my bikini area (with the electric razor), and back in the shower to wash off. Having the Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle razor makes it so much easier to just do everything in the shower and everything feels so smooth! I didn&#x27;t use the length setter because I like a close shave but I love that it comes with an option! Mine did not come with a plastic blade cover and that is the only bad thing because you have to remember to take it out of the shower and dry it off or the blades will rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I got this for free from bzzagent* #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I received this awesome shaver to review and absolutely love it. I had this same one a couple of years ago. I love how its much lighter but dont like how it lies down instead of having a holder like my other Schick shaver. I would definitely recommend this shaver to any woman, you literally dont have to buy another shaver for a good couple of years. Very durable.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I think it is really good. I have tried all kinds of razors, from the super cheap ones from the dollar store to the moderately expensive ones. This is what I consider &amp;#34;moderately expensive&amp;#34; for me, at least. Great razor, I am quite impressed! Though I prefer epilating over shaving, if I had to pick a razor it&#x27;d be this one. So far no cuts or irritated skin like with others I have tried in the past. I have used it both with and without shaving cream and it definitely works better with it. The moisturizing bar definitely leaves skin moisturized. Great handle for easy handling, and great for any area of the body. Overall, it is a great razor, leaves skin smooth and the save does last a little longer than others. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I received my Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor free from BuzzAgent and I&#x27;m so glad I did!! The five blades gave me such a close and smooth shave that 4 days later my legs are still soft and smooth! The moisturizing serum actually does moisturize your legs and bikini area without irritation! I have really sensitive skin so it&#x27;s awesome to find a product that doesn&#x27;t leave me red bumpy and blotchy but actually works and makes me want to show off my legs instead of hide them away! I love it!! I found that the trimmer ever though it has multiple settings to choose from wasn&#x27;t a close enough shave for me it really is just for trimming and not removing all the hair. But the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof is awesome so you can use it in the shower or out of it when your in a rush and just need to do some touch ups quick!! Overall I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try this product for free.  I really liked this razor/trimmer.  Not only is it a great razor but to add a trimmer to it that is so easy to use is awesome.  While using the trimmer I never had to worry about getting any cuts or nicks, it was so easy to use and glided perfectly. I also love that it has different length blades for the trimmer. The razor left my legs feeling soft and silky and smooth.  I have always loved the Schick Hydro Silk razor and now with a trimmer attached you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Summer must have!&lt;br /&gt;I just received my Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle from bzzagent and I love it! First thing I noticed taking it out of its package was that it was pretty(I like pretty things). It&#x27;s also the perfect size, so its not awkward in my hand. They also included the battery, major points for that. The razor head seems slightly bigger than my usual razor, but that&#x27;s a good thing. On to performance, this thing is awesome. I did my whole body(underarms, arms, legs and down below). I felt like it cut my shaving time at least by half. Didn&#x27;t have to go over any areas more than once! The gel did the trick while in the shower but once I got out I had to apply lotion. My favorite part, the trimmer. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been shaving without it! I go for all bare down below, so it takes time. The trimmer made it easy to use the razor and be smooth after 1 swipe! All in all, I love love love this razor! Would definitely recommend and I will absolutely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I got this razor from BzzAgent to try out for free and first of all this product is so cute, I love the packing and colors! Purples and blues!! The product itself is a nice size and comes with a battery that is used to power the trimmer part of it. I tried it out for the first time today and I kept thinking, are the blades working??!!? Because of how soft this product is on the skin you don&#x27;t even feel the blades!&lt;br /&gt;The best part is how soft your skin feels after shaving, even before you put lotion on. I have the product 4 stars only because I just got it yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product especially to those who have sensitve skin, like me, I usually find that most razors irritate my skin but this product doesn&#x27;t so it will for sure replace my current razor.</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I was given the opportunity to try this wonderful product for free! I will admit that I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this product. I thought it was going to be your typical razor that does what any other razor does. Boy, was I wrong! I was astonished at how easily it glided across my legs and how silky the moisturizing serum left them. I have terrible scars from past shavings with other brands, and ever since then I have always been very aware of avoiding that. However, now I don&#x27;t really worry so much. I never realized how hard I held the razor against my leg because I never got a close shave, but using the Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor I barely applied any pressure and got the results I was looking for! Also, I&#x27;m very pleased with the trimmer, which surprised me the most since the price for all of this is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to warn those who have never used a razor like this before, such as myself, is to be careful with the razor after shaving! I forgot all about the moisturizing serum and accidentally smudged it since it was still wet. Entirely my fault! Overall, I will definitely be buying this product again and would gladly recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Writing my review as part of a promotion. I have tried this razor twice and razor is amazing. My issue is with the trimmer. it doesn&#x27;t work. I set it to 0 than 1 ,2 and so on and no change.</li>
    <li> Thanks to bzzagent I received a free razor to use.  I absolutely love this razor.  The only problem was bumps from not using any shaving cream.  I will definitely buy this one myself.  I have used it everyday since I received it.  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> When I first was offered this as a free sample through BzzAgent I was a little nervous because I have extremely sensitive skin and over the years I&#x27;ve tried at least 15 different razors. Sensitive skin as in no matter what razor I use to shave and whether I use baby oil, the most sensitive skin shave cream, or any of those other fancy shave gels/foams/creams I always end up with burning, irritated, red, razor bump covered legs and other shavable areas (and eventually ingrown hairs everywhere). Lucky me. When I received this razor I noticed the packaging was nice and it was all recyclable cardboard, minus a little plastic, which also made it easy to open. I tried it out the next day before leaving for my besties big birthday dinner and was pleasantly surprised. My legs have never felt so silky smooth!! They did still have a slight burning sensation but I had no razor burn and still don&#x27;t have any ingrown hairs showing up (this was 3 days ago). Of course when I got to my friend&#x27;s house to pick her up I immediately made her feel my legs and she was impressed as well. I&#x27;d highly recommend this razor to any of my friends and I think I even have found my new razor. I can&#x27;t comment on the bikini trimming feature however.</li>
    <li> Listed as way too expensive at the moment (come on, $32?), but if the price goes down (say $10-20) it is a good price. Luckily, I received it free as a BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason you should buy this overpriced item is the trimmer. A razor is a razor, even though the moisturizing serum is very nice. I would recommend removing the razor head if you use the trimmer in the shower, because otherwise it wastes the moisturizer. It&#x27;s also really easy to take the head on and off, so even if you are going to shave as well, you should take it off.&lt;br /&gt;Since I wear glasses and thus could barely see what was going on in the shower, I much preferred using the trimmer dry. It does have a nice grip so it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be easy to drop, even with wet slippery hands. Though bulky, it&#x27;s pretty nice to hold. IT DOES NOT GET AN EXCEEDINGLY CLOSE SHAVE. I used it without the comb, just to see how close it would go. First, you need to go against the hair and go over the same area at least three times to get all the hair. Second, hair is left, about 1/16 or 1/32 of an inch (I didn&#x27;t use a ruler). It is very pain free; the only pain from the trimmer was it pulled one hair when I was figuring out what angle to hold it at.Other than that, you can do it without looking and it doesn&#x27;t (or at least didn&#x27;t on me) pinch any skin. But if you do it without looking, you can&#x27;t see which areas you need to go over again.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product. However, I would not pay full price for it. Only you can decide what a good quality 2 in 1 is worth to you, but I would look askance at paying over $15 for it, especially since razor refills will be expensive.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Venus Embrace for years and received this for free from BzzAgent to share my experience with this product. I will be switching to this razor now that I have tried the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle! Leaves my legs smooth and moisturized (and my boyfriend loves it too)! No itchiness after shaving and I didn&#x27;t cut myself once! You have to try this for yourself!</li>
    <li> my wife got this as a smaple from buzzagent and she absolutely loves it. she loves how smooth her legs feel after she is done using it.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have bought, my first one lasted for at least two years. The great thing is you can change out the razor on the end for legs/arm pits so it&#x27;s reusable. The handle is comfortable and the razor size for the bikini area is perfect for getting an even trim. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this razor. Won&#x27;t be needing to grab my husband&#x27;s anymore. The razor is great on stubborn leg hairs. Leaving my legs the smoothest it has ever been and given me a feel of soft, silky, hydrating skin. The trimmer is the cherry on the top. Great for women who aren&#x27;t trying to bare it all.</li>
    <li> When I inserted the battery and got her goin, it sounded weak and sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once I went in for the cha cha croppin.. Oooh wee! My laldy bits below are now hella groomed!</li>
    <li> Swimsuit season is upon us and the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor &amp; Bikini Trimmer arrived just in time, thanks to BzzAgent!  As someone who always has a trimmer and multiple razors residing in the shower, I was very excited to try this waterproof two-in-one product.  A single AAA battery powers the trimmer and admittedly with the guard on it seemed a little weak, but once I took that off I was good to go and it worked just as well as my very expensive former trimmer.  The razor side is silky smooth and very moisturizing, I got a nice close shave without a single nick, my legs also remained silky after my shower without the use of any extra cream products.  The only (very minor) downside was that you have to hold the power button down on the trimmer the entire time you&#x27;re using it.  It can be a little awkward to try to maneuver while doing that, but I adjusted pretty quickly and it would not prevent me from purchasing this item again. I would highly recommend this combo to anyone looking for a great in-shower trimmer.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when this came in the mail! I got it Free as part of a Bzzagent campaign that I am a part of where I try out the product and give it my honest opinion. I opened it up and to my surprise realized that this razor also had a trimmer attachment at the other end, I honestly thought I was just getting a new razor to try so the trimmer was like icing on the cake! Took me a minute to figure out where to put the battery but that is just because I was too impatient to read the instructions, which by the way were super easy to follow. The little trimmer is amazing safe close shave with no cuts involved. I have always liked to keep clean shaven in my bikini area and it&#x27;s always been such a process, In the past I have used the hair clippers and obviously couldn&#x27;t shave in the shower because I didn&#x27;t want to electrocute myself. I think the best feature about this all in one Razor Trimmer is that it is WATERPROOF! Yep that&#x27;s right just jump in the shower and take care of it all at once trim up the bikini area, shave the arm pits and legs and you are good to go! No More pre- shower ritual with the hair trimmers and bulky cord Win Win! compared to my regular razors I have bought in the past this thing is pure royalty. The shave was so smooth that I had to keep feeling my legs to make sure it was actually shaving them and I forgot to put the shaving cream in the shower but I didn&#x27;t even need it, since I forgot it and was already shaving I decided to just use water and the razor and expected that maybe I would have some razor burn after... but nope no razor burn what so ever! My only complaint about this nifty little contraption is that I am 100% certain my husband may try to steal it, guess I will have to get creative with my hiding places. Definitely will be buying the refill heads and will be sticking with this razor from now on. No going back to the old razor now!</li>
    <li> I doubted that this razor would change anything about my routine boy was I wrong...It it the closest shave that I have had in years. The fact the whole thing is waterproof blows my mind, to be able to trim down the hair in no time with no tugging or hassle is a beautiful thing. I have told my friends and family all about this razor and everyone that I talked to has become a believer...I think that the moisture strip on the razor works so well that is has helped my skin to not be so irritated after shaving</li>
    <li> I can not explain how good this product really is!  It makes shaving a breeze.  The hair just slides right off literally.  Its like magic.  I have to say that the only flaws is the volume of the buzzer and that it just does not shave my thighs as well.  It is easily cleanable. Its gets a verrry close shave to your legs.  I did receive this items for free from Bzzagent.  #Gotitfree</li>
    <li> I love the feeling after using this razor! My razor burn is starting to go away and I have more room in the shower than before. My shower was starting to become cluttered with multiple items I bought to smooth things out. I used to purchase the cheaper razors and received this one as a free sample. I&#x27;m beginning to think it&#x27;s worth the extra money. Wondering how long it will be usable and pending that I will determine whether it&#x27;s worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> Used this razor yesterday, and was very happy with the results.  It gave me a silky smooth shave, and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling raw thanks to the moisturizing strip. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I received the Hydro Silk for women as a free item from BZZagent. This razor is awesome, it releases moisture as you shave with a moisture strip. To activate the strip, hold the razor under water for a few seconds and then begin to shave. You don&#x27;t even need shave gel!! It flows right across your skin leaving you with smooth soft skin.The result was a close shave with soft legs! It also comes with a built in bikini trimmer which makes for a super easy grooming process. Only 1 tool needed for all your grooming and shaving needs. I love love love this razor!!</li>
    <li> I did not buy this from amazon, I got it from BzzAgent and Schick as a free trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay... I love the concept of a 2-in-1 razor and trimmer that is waterproof... great for women and perfect for use in the shower! But the trimmer was a little narrow and the razor would be better with a smaller moisturizing strip around the edge so you could get a closer shave without having to go over the same area again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall... not a bad razor and it DOES leave your skin feeling very moisturized and smooth.</li>
    <li> OK, so to start off, I do not have sensitive skin on my legs what so ever... with this razor I decided to shave 1 leg just plain old water and the other leg with shaving cream for better results  as suggested.... I did not see much of a difference  to be honest lol... the razor did a decent enough  job in the smoothness department but holy cow did I get HORRIBLE razor burn on BOTH my legs... like OMG burning itchy worse than sunburn feeling, it was awful. I&#x27;ve honestly had cheapo disposable  razors give less razor burn.. I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I had some sort of reaction to the moisturizer on the razor but I&#x27;m too afraid to try again lol.. for my legs I think I will stick to the regular Schick hydro that I steal from my fiance, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with that one yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received  this as a sample for being part of the bzzAgent program,.. my review  (as if you couldn&#x27;t tell lol) is 100% personal opinion.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best razor I have ever owned! I love how close the shave is because of the five blades. I was using a men&#x27;s razor to get a close shave before Bzz Agent sent me this razor to try! I have had other razors with trimmers, too, but water would get where the battery is. This would make the trimmers quit and it wasn&#x27;t worth the money spent. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with this razor at all! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Loved, loved, loved this razor. The moisture strip left my legs feeling soft and smooth. The trimmer end has a guide to choose your own setting, which is fantastic. Comes with a battery, very convenient. Recommend this for a must have summer tool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(full disclosure: received product free from BzzAgent)</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I Received this as a free product from BzzAgent and Schick.  That being said this is how I feel about the razor and trimmer.  On the razor very short and sweet, It works. It&#x27;s a very nice razor and the moisturizing thing on it does just that Moisturize. The only downside i can see to the razor is that the moisturizing thing does get kinda gooey sometimes and feels a little gross but after a few swipes it goes back to feeling the way it normally does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the trimmer. I normally steal my Hubbys trimmer so when i was told i would be getting this i was SUPER excited. once it came in the mail and i tried it i was disappointed. I&#x27;m not sure if it;s just because my Hubby as a nice trimmer or what but it didn&#x27;t work as well as his. After a few minutes for fighting with it i just flipped it around and used the razor to finish up because it wasn&#x27;t worth the fight. That being said If you don&#x27;t have a trimmer in the house for the price this is a great deal and will do the job... just not as well as some other things might be able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue to use the razor and when need buy refills for it.</li>
    <li> I normally use cheap disposable razors because I hate spending money on something that seems so frivolous. I am very presently surprised by this Schick. The first time I used it my skin was softer. There S absolutely no pulling when I shaved especially on my bikini line. At first, I figured it was just a nice shave. I figured I would get razor burn after awhile just like all the other razors I&#x27;ve used. This was not the case and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I have been shaving more frequently with less irritation. That being said, my only complaint is that you have to hold the button for the trimmer. It&#x27;s a slight inconvenience that I&#x27;m very willing to over look. I will be purchasing blades for this in the future.</li>
    <li> Amazing Razor! I received it for free as a product promotion and I am very forever grateful I&#x27;ve always had a problem with razor burn and ending up with still that layer of peach fuzz in the bikini area. This razor actually did the trick! I tried the trimmer for sake of experimenting even though I shave, not trim, and it was super easy. Definitely highly recommend.</li>
    <li> When I want a close leg shave and better yet bikini shave, I want a product that truly works. Not all of them out there on the market do. Some don&#x27;t take care of the hair whatsoever. Other&#x27;s leave a trail of moisturizied smoothness behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular razor is definitely one of a kind! The first of it&#x27;s kind that I have had the pleasure of using. Here&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Trimmer - This feature is absolutely AMAZING! Normally I would have to use my husbands spare trimmer to get the job done down there but not anymore. This one trims way better than his ever has. I also like that it comes with a cap to level out how short you want your trim to be. Absolutely no risk of getting cut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Razor - Wow! Best razor I have ever used. It got my skin uber smooth and it left behind moisturized, lovely skin. No razor burn whatsoever with this one! It&#x27;s the razor that has allowed me to have the closest shave possible too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*2 in 1 - I love that they finally came out with something decent for us women to use! No having to pick up a razor, put it down, only to pick up a trimmer and vice versa. It&#x27;s convenient to have all of this is one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall experience with this razor/trimmer combo has been phenomenal. I have never had a better shaving and trimming experience with any other razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shick never disappoints! Thanks again for thinking of us women!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample from BzzAgent for review purposes. All opinions expressed here are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I received the product free from bzzagent. There are a couple things that I didn&#x27;t like about the trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;1. I used it on my bikini area and it tugged at the hairs which made it very painful. I then started to use it very slowly but it would sometimes still tug at the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;2. It didn&#x27;t do a close shave so I then had to go back and use the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did like about the trimmer was it was very easy to take apart and clean. I love the razor part. I have been using the same exact kind for a couple years. My only problem with it is theres no protective cap on iit which can cause a cut when using the trimmer part. Overall, I like the concept of having a trimmer and razor combo. Maybe if the trimmer was a little wider and the blade sharper, it would be better.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this it makes my legs soft and a clean shave unlike other brands I tried using it gives you a clean cut and it helped me last longer I didn&#x27;t have to shave every three days&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was well packed and the razor itself was really sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product from bzz agent for free to give my honest opinion</li>
    <li> I got this razor for a free trial and I am impressed! This is the best razor I have used! The trimmer works great! My favorite part is the moisture strip that is activated when it gets wet. Unlike most razors, you can feel the difference! My legs have never felt smoother and more moisturized even days after shaving. Another thing I really liked was the handle, it was very comfortable to hold and maneuver! Overall this is a great product!</li>
    <li> I received this razor to test and give my opinion on. In all honesty I think I would like this razor a lot more if I had more hair. I&#x27;m not one for hair, I really like having a smooth everything, so the trimmer was really pointless for me. I think I would really like like that part of it if I had more hair though. Onto the razor; it&#x27;s a nice razor. I have very sensitive skin, so I liked this razor along with shaving cream, but when I used it alone I got razor burn from it (In the more intimate areas, not my legs). So, all in all, the razor is nice, but since I don&#x27;t have enough hair to trim, that end is just big and pointless to me.</li>
    <li> i got this yesterday and had to dive right in and try it.when you have the same routine, sometimes you are apprehensive to try others. i love it! clean close shaves, no razor burn or bumps and no pain as compared to waxing! i like to keep the trimming to a short level and get it done quickly with the new TrimStyle. thanks bzz agent for the opportunity to leave a review</li>
    <li> I got this product to review for free from BzzAgent And for once I&#x27;m impressed. This razor  actually does what it advertises it will do. It gives your legs a close shave and moisturizes while you shaves so you don&#x27;t get those hideous red bumps or irritation. The trimmer is awesome and also shaves close and is easy to keep your bikini area trimmed and styled the way you prefer. I give this 5 stars and recommend it to anyone. And believe me I usually don&#x27;t recommend anything to anyone BC most products advertise lies but this one is truth. A miracle!</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotion through Bzzagent but does not influence my opinion in anyways. I was extremely excited to try a new razor and knowing it doubled as a trimmer was nearly a double whammy. I waited about a week to allow my bikini area to grow out. The first time I used the trimmer was not in the shower, I simply wanted to know what it was capable of before I tested it in the water. Although it comes with an adjustable clip I proceeded to take this off, I knew I would want the closest trim as possible. To my surprise it was pretty good, it did take a couple tries before I got down to only millimeter length but it got there eventually. I proceed to take a shower and test the razor in water. I first tried the razor on my legs and was not too impressed. It was similar to a disposable razor and as someone who only buys 5blade razors this was &#x27;ehhh.&#x27; Now for the trimmer, it worked a lot better under water. I did knick myself, so be careful! It was quite painful. The razor also proceeded to fall on my toe and peeled some skin off. Overall, I want to continue to experiment with it. I think once I figure out a technique I will be able to have a better experience. On the plus side there are many coupons I can use and give to others who I know will also enjoy trying this duo out.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product because of BzzAgent. This new tool have been great since I first tried it, the razor have done it&#x27;s job quite well; the trimmer works really well with my bikini area. I really like that it is battery operated that you can use it in the shower without worrying that you might get electrocuted and cord-free. The 3-level adjustable comb is well built you can trim your bikini area just the right length you desire. Also, I dont have to worry that I might get scratches in the hard to reach area. I&#x27;m so happy I got to try this and will surely recommend it to everybody!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as sample in a Buzfeed box and have been loving it! The razor part is awesome. It gives me such a soft, close shave and lasts for longer than I have ever experienced before. I wasn&#x27;t as crazy about the trimmer. I don&#x27;t really have a use for it, but I would definitely purchase the product just for the awesome razor.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try a new razor since my old go-to razor just wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cutting&amp;#34; it anymore ;). Schick Hydro Silk gave me an incredible close shave that actually lasted more than a day or two! I was happy to not have to worry about dry skin and my sensitive skin didn&#x27;t rebel like it loves to do with most products.</li>
    <li> I thought that the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor was just okay. I didn&#x27;t think it was as effective as a normal razor is on keeping my skin smooth. I found that I still had to use a razor in order to clean up areas after using this. I couldn&#x27;t get close enough to my skin to get all the hair and I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t buy this on my own because I would be extremely disappointed with it.</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle®. I got this item to try for free and  used it a few times and have to say it&#x27;s just okay in my opinion.  I found both the trimmer and the razor to work very well separately but to use together it was rather awkward in my hands.  I prefer to use the trimmer with the shaving head not on it.  I also had a problem with the razor part rusting in the shower.  Schick is a great brand but just not a huge fan of this design.</li>
    <li> I was already using the Schick Hydro Silk razor before I tried the TrimStyle for free through BzzAgent. I honestly don&#x27;t use the bikini trimmer because the razor itself works perfectly for my leg and bikini routine. This razor moisturizes as I shave and has reduced the need for shaving cream and on my legs, I no longer need to use shaving cream at all because this razor works so well by itself. This razor leaves my legs super smooth and has never cut me. It also stays effective through many shaves. I would recommend this to anyone looking to improve their leg and bikini routine.</li>
    <li> great product. I could test it for free and thank you for it bzzagent. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a product like this. After figuring out how to use this product, I have loved it ever since. It has been my go to razor. The trimmer works great and the razor lets out a moisture that helps me to not cut myself. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it for anyone who wants that professional bikini line without having to pay $50 or more to get it.</li>
    <li> Want a great razor and bikini trimmer in one? Well this razor offers it! I love my Schick Hydro Silk Trim Style razor. The moisturizing strip is great for my skin and the razor provides that close shave that just makes it even better. And then the different trim levels for the added bikini trimmer. You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor!!! Buy yours today and see for yourself!</li>
    <li> I love the TrimStyle 2-in-1  Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor and Bikini Trimmer, I had the privilege of testing free from Buzz agent! I was excited to try out the new battery operated bikini end of the Schick Hydro Silk. I&#x27;d never used an electronic bikini Trimmer before. There are three lengths you can set the white plastic razor guard to so you can pick your hair length. It works great.  The razor part shaves nice and close, leaving my legs feel smooth and moisturized. I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try!</li>
    <li> Love this razor! Both the razor and trimmer work great! I love that it is 2 in 1. I don&#x27;t understand the purpose of the comb though, since you are not able to use the trimmer with the comb on even though the directions indicate otherwise. But it is very handy in the summer months when you are getting ready for the beach or pool! I received this free from Bzzagent.</li>
    <li> What a close and smooth shave!! I always have issues getting a close enough shave around my knobby knees. The 5 blades and mobility of this razor allowed for a nice close shave with no stubble left over. The moisturizer strip is everything it was promised, I was able to go at least an hour after my shower before I had to put on lotion, which is much better then having itchy dry skin the second I step out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Trimmer portion was a little more difficult, as I normally do not use these. This being the first combined razor of its kind I did not expect it to be perfection. The battery it came with did not work, and the button is very temperamental so it took some time to figure out how to use it. Once I did it provided a nice even shave. There was no tugging sensations and the vibrations from the motion did not leave my hand tingly which was nice. I must disclose that I did not use the trimmer in the shower, though it is waterproof I am still skeptical of the whole electricity in water thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive the product as a free sample as a promotional package from Schick.</li>
    <li> I got this razor free from #bzzagent, but this is my honest opinion. I like this razor for my bikini area because the razor head is smaller and more compact, but I didn&#x27;t like it for my legs. it was too small, and it didn&#x27;t see to want to curve as well, and I kept hitting the trim button which scared me twice, and I cut myself. So the button takes some getting used to, with not hitting it, but i will say that i love the conditioning strip. It left my legs really smooth for longer than my other razor. i also didn&#x27;t have as bad razor bumps</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from BzzAgent about a month ago and immediately tried it out! The Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle razor is a 2-n-1 razor that has both a trimmer and normal style razor. The trimmer is great for you bikini area. It makes grooming simple and quick. After having a child recently, the amount of time I am able to take a shower is limited. This razor makes grooming my bikini area easy and I am in and out of the shower in no time. I personally took the trim guard off to get as close of a shave as possible. As far as the actual razor part, I think it was a good quality razor. It was very moisturizing and did not leave any razor bumps or burns. The reason I am giving this product 4 stars is because the razor did not give me as close of a shave on my armpits compared to some of the other razors that I have used. This is overall a great product.</li>
    <li> I recieved this as a #bzzagent review. The razor part is great. Nice close and smooth. However the trimmer left something to be desired. I ended up with a couple deep cuts and I had to go back over every thing with the razor after I was done with the trimmer</li>
    <li> Super amazing razor! Gives a great close shave leaving skin super soft and has a super convenient trimmer on other end! Perfect for summer time and bikinis! Well worth purchasing!</li>
    <li> I received this free via bzzagent. I am overall pleased with this product! The razor left my skin smooth and no stubble for a couple days. The trimmer was easy to use and only took a couole minutes to get in tip top shape :) thank you #bzzagent #gotitfree</li>
    <li> Super fantastic. I got this for free from BzzAgent and I love it. i cant live without it, its the greatest razor ive ever had, had i not gotten it for free i dont think i would have ever gotten it. It even came with coupons which i thought was kind of awesome. It gives you a close shave on your legs and as somebody who is always short on time i need all the help i can get. Its a great investment.</li>
    <li> Hi I got this product from BzzAgent for free to try and review. And I loved it. Best razor I have ever had. I would not replace it for any other. Its a keeper.</li>
    <li> Love this razor. I got this for free from bzzagent and will be purchasing in the future. It&#x27;s great. I get a close shave every time with no irritation. The trimmer is great for hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> I received that Schick Hyrdo Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini Trimmer as part of a promotion from the brand. Even though shaving is NOT one of my favorite beauty regimens, I was excited to give it a try. In fact, I would consider it to be more of a chore! I do most of my shaving in the shower, and I&#x27;m always paranoid that I will clumsily cut myself while trying to get a close shave (it&#x27;s happened many times before). I mostly blame the narrow, pencil width handles that most commercial razors are designed to have. Unlike the traditional woman&#x27;s razor, the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle has a thick, substantial handle with a rubber-like grip that is super easy to hold and maneuver, even with wet hands! I didn&#x27;t know how much I would love this design feature, until I&#x27;d successfully and confidently used this razor several times without injury. The smoothness and closeness of the actual shave is also superior to most of the razors I&#x27;ve used in the past. The Hydro Silk TrimStyle has FIVE blades that work seamlessly with the two moisturizer strips (one above the blades and one below). I&#x27;ve found that the five blade styles are most often found on men&#x27;s razors; which I have used in the past. As I mentioned, shaving isn&#x27;t my favorite pastime; so I&#x27;d prefer to get it over with as soon as possible. In the winter months, I hardly ever shave my legs...what&#x27;s the point? I was really impressed that, even without shaving cream (just a thin lather of bar soap), the Hydro Silk TrimStyle was able to plow through the results of my wintertime laziness in just one or two strokes. Before using this razor, I would need to go over the same spots about 10-12 times to get a decent enough shave on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the Hydro Silk TrimStyle has the same easy maneuverability when shaving my underarms. However, I&#x27;m not sure if the closeness of the shave was the same. I do typically use cream or gel when shaving my underarms, but it is still tricky to keep the skin taut enough to get a close shave. Unlike most razors, the blades did not irritate my skin afterwards. Because the moisturizer strips are at both ends of the blade, you can shave either upwards or downwards and still protect your skin from getting chaffed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not previously familiar with using an electric bikini trimmer. The first time I used this part of the razor I removed the trim comb; thinking it was just a cap to cover the blades when you are using the other end. The result was a bit too short (i.e. prickly) for my preference...user error. The trim comb actually has adjustable settings that let you maintain a lengthier trim. Being a novice at bikini area trimming, I did wonder why the blades (on the trimmer side) were so flat. Does this keep them from getting too dull? I noticed that the trimmer blades cannot be replaced without getting another razor. I don&#x27;t think I will be using this end of the razor very often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle is a great tool! However, there are two small qualms that tempted me out of giving it five out of five stars. First, I think the two moisturizer strips are very valuable, but they tend to dissolve rather quickly. Is there any way to make them last longer? My experience was that the first shave (with a new blade) is a lot closer and smoother than those that follow. Lastly, the product I received did not include a holder piece to mount the razor on a wall. I know that Schick makes these, and the Hydro Silk TrimStyle does have a &#x27;clip&#x27; on one side that looks like it attaches to a holder. I like to keep all of my shower products and tools organized. The wall mounted shower holder would&#x27;ve been nice to have for easier access.Unlike most razors, the blades did not irritate my skin afterwards.

    <li> So, I always bought those packs of disposable razors, maybe they&#x27;d have twin blades or something, thinking those were fine. Good enough. I was... wrong! Shaving with the  Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor was such a huge difference, like night and day. This razor has five blades, and glides so much better on the skin. It caused so much less irritation, which I had accepted as a regular part of shaving my sensitive skin. Even with using a good shaving cream, those disposable twin blade razors still don&#x27;t hold a candle, and the TrimStyle is made even better. And that&#x27;s only half of it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer! I never used a trimmer before, and now I&#x27;m never looking back. The trimmer on the other end of this razor has an adjustable comb attachment. This is cool, because you can adjust it to your personal preference. Being waterproof, you can use this in the shower right after shaving legs, and that&#x27;s super convenient. The batter being included is a bonus as well; you&#x27;re ready to go as soon as you open this bad boy up. Indeed, instructions are included as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m never going back to disposable twin blades.  I plan on keeping the handle with trimmer end for as long as it lasts, and simply replacing spent razor heads as needed.  My skin has never felt better after shaving, I know it&#x27;s the 5 bladed Hydro Silk razor to thank!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[I received this free for review from BzzAgent. All opinions expressed are my own.]</li>
    <li> So I got this razor through bzzagent! I must say that this razor is simply amazing! The regular razor on this make me extra smooth and glides perfectly on my legs! I must say that it is a bigger razor then normal one but is extremely nice. I like that its bigger! The bikini trimmer on this is great too. I will have to buy this in the future!!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the Schick Hyrdo Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini Trimmer! I received the TrimStyle for free as a part of BzzAgent. I was excited to try it out. The device is an electric trimmer on one side and a moisturizing razor on the other side. It&#x27;s very heavy duty and does not seem like it would break easily. The trimmer offers 4 different lengths and is easy to adjust. The razor is a five blade razor with a moisturizing strip. The trimmer runs on batteries (which are included!) and can be used in or out of the shower, which is wonderful! This makes for much easier clean up. Overall I would highly recommend this product. I can&#x27;t imagine a more efficient, cost effective way to get ready for summer bikinis!</li>
    <li> I received this razor through bzzagent the other week and I have fell in love with this razor. I hate shaving with regular razors because I feel like they never give me a close enough shave. With this razor, that issue is fixed. The 2 in 1 feature thai razor provides is great. It&#x27;s so convenient to be able to use the bikini trimmer both in and out of the shower. I was very impressed with this product and I will definitely be shopping with Schick in the future.</li>
    <li> I would like to start off by saying that this is by far the best razor I have ever used. It is smooth to the skin and gives a nice clean shave. The trimmer works really well with bikini area. I recieved this razor free from bzz agent to try and I am so glad I got it because it is defintely worth getting one. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually one to write a review on a razor, however this one is a winner! I am already a longtime user of the regular Hydro Silk. I really enjoy the trimmer on this version though, and even the razor end seems to be improved. It seems they&#x27;ve beefed up the moisture strips around the razor and I find that I get a closer more long-lasting shave with less irritation. The trimmer uses batteries and vibrates, which makes more of a difference than I thought it would (I have used non-powered trimmer razors before that never worked very well).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super excited to share my awesome experience with #Schick HydroSilk that I #GotItFree from #BzzAgent - Lucky Me! ;) Girls, it finally arrived - the best female razor ever. I just loved how smooth it felt when I used it on my legs. It has a great lotion in the base of the razor, but not the one that leaves that terrible tangly liquid as the Venus does. Great handle design, very comfortable to shave while in the shower, it doesn&#x27;t slip from your hand when it gets wet. I didn&#x27;t try the trimmer on myself, but on my husband it worked great! :) don&#x27;t ask me how I got him to try it... :-D</li>
    <li> I really like this new razor. Its really easy to use and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. The trim side works fantastically and has a great guide comb. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that if its left in the shower then the two hydration bars on the razor part start to get gummy and the next time you shave it gets a little sticky. I did get this razor has a free trail. but would definitely go buy one at the store.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free as part of a BzzAgent campaign &amp; I absolutly love it!! The only thing I disliked was that there was no cover for the blades so it made it hard to travel with the razor. All in all it was a great product the closeness of the shave was amazing &amp; it moisturized well. I would definitely recommend to a friend :)</li>
    <li> Oh, how I will never use another razor again! I love my new Schick Hydro Silk Trim Style!! At first I was a little on edge about using this in the shower, so I used the trimmer portion dry.  I was so excited about how quick this worked.  I went into the bedroom and told my husband he was next!  The trimmer gives you a nice even trim (extremely quick) without snagging any hairs, no need to break out the scissors or my husbands eyebrow trimmer LOL.  Now the added bonus  is the razor portion with 4 blades that you can easily replace the heads when it is time just like a regular razor.  Instead of having 2 tools it is combined into one for Women.  Thank you Schick for coming up with an AMAZING PRODUCT for women.  The next morning I broke down and used it in the shower.  Looks can be deceiving, I thought it would be heavy and awkward to shave with because the handle is larger than my usual razor.  I have found it is very comfortable to shave with and shaves very well around knees, ankles, and legs.  I do not use shaving cream and I was left with very smooth legs. The packaging is much easier to open than most razor packages and the trimmer comes with a really good name brand battery that will last.  I highly recommend this product to anyone even thinking about trying, you will not be disappointed.  I would like to thank BzzAgent and Schick for allowing me to try this Schick Hydro Silk Razor Trim Style razor free.</li>
    <li> I just used this razor for the first time and I am in LOVE. I usually experience razor burn as well as itchiness whenever I shave. It is very uncomfortable. I tried this razor on a whim and am so glad I did! My legs are so smooth and I do not experience any itchiness or razor burn at all! I do still need to put lotion on afterwards but that is because I have dry skin. I highly recommend this to anyone who has sensitive skin like me. I also tried the bikini razor side and had great results. I also get razor burn in that area and this was super helpful!</li>
    <li> Love this razor. Left my legs feeling smooth. Def worth the price. :)</li>
    <li> I received this razor from bzzagent.com, therefore I did not pay for it, but I will next time! This is a great razor. The trimmer is great, since I don&#x27;t have any hair long enough on my own body, my fiance uses it. The trimmer works just as well as a full sized trimmer, as you would use to shave a head. It works on every part of his body, without a problem. The only problem I have with the trimmer is that neither of us could get it to work well in the shower, I would recommend using it before a shower, which really isn&#x27;t too much of a problem in my opinion!&lt;br /&gt;The razor is very good, it shaves well, and the blades are very sharp. This razor has lasted a while, any other razor I have used would already be dull by now! It allows me to shave easily and quickly, with not many problems. The one problem I have had with this razor, which I have with every razor I have used, is that it always leaves a cut or two in my skin. I&#x27;m not sure if this is just me but I can&#x27;t seem to shave without cutting myself! Over all, I would no doubt recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE it! I was scared it would be difficult to use but once I got it out and started using it, I wanted to shave my whole body lol</li>
    <li> I got this razor free to try as part of a promotion.  I like this razor.  The only reason I knocked off a star is that I found the trim length to be a bit too long for what I like.  I didn&#x27;t have any problem with the main razor head and shave since I have light hair that isn&#x27;t too coarse or dark.  I also wish that the main razor head was battery operated like my Venus razor. Overall, it&#x27;s a good multi-use grooming tool.</li>
    <li> I received my Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor from BuzzAgent for free in return for my review of the products function and style. Overall it&#x27;s a solid razor. I like that it has multiple blades and a really awesome gel surrounding the blades to help moisturize the skin and avoid razor burn; however, after a couple of uses and storage in my gym bag (in a ziploc) I found that the gel moisturizer fell completely off and the blades dulles rather quickly leaving a rough. dare I say rusted, edge. Such a bummer for an &amp;#34;elite&amp;#34; style razor. Beyond that the bikini trimmer is really interesting. I like that I couldn&#x27;t cut myself like I might if I was using a regular razor. The cut isn&#x27;t as close to the skin as a razor but that&#x27;s the trade off I guess. For the design I have no major issues with the razor side, it was solid and well manipulated in my hand. On the trimmer side, I wish that there was a better way to turn it on and off since the angle that my finger had to be, on the button, to keep it operating was kind of awkward and I found it frequently slipping off. Again, it&#x27;s a solid razor overall but could use some tweaking to make it really worth it&#x27;s cost... As always, the quest for good hair removal continues.</li>
    <li> I had the Schick Quattro prior to this and I received this one free to try and I love it even more. I really like that you don&#x27;t need shaving cream because I always forget to buy it. Just add water and your ready to go. The trimmer is great it gives a amazing close trim.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to be able to try this product free as part of a bzz campaign. I tried the razor for a couple of weeks and feel that this in all is a good razor except that I feel that it is a little hard to use with a razor on both sides.  I did use this razor for a couple of weeks and it does leave my legs and bikini area nice and smooth while leaving not friction marks or red dots.  I liked how it has a moisturizing strip which does actually seem to help add moisture  to my skin.  So far the razor is still sharp enough to use which is a benefit since I have used this multiple times, the blade actually stays sharp even after the moisturizing strip is gone.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a Bzz Agent Campain and I was so excited to try this razor - I usually get razor burn bad on my legs and bikini area. When it arrived I used it the next day. The shave of the razor was super close but I tried shaving with just body wash and still had some razor burn (see pics). On the second day I tried the razor with shave gel and the results were perfect! NO razor burn at all. I plan to continue to use this razor and buy refills for this instead of my regular schick hydro razor. I feel like it really does help make your legs smoother and it moisturizes well (I still use lotion after showering but feel less dry then normal after this razor is used). Now, as far as the trimmer goes. I was not able to use it at first because I personally prefer a complete &amp;#34;Brazilian&amp;#34; shave. After waiting for some growth long enough to trim, I tried the trimmer. It is a nice feature but even without the adjustable plate on I was not able to receive the close shave I like (just a personal preference, the tool worked well and was easy to use). So, I told my husband he can use the trimmer for his man-scaping, as his trimmer currently does not have the ability to be used in the shower. He loves it! It makes a nice trim for him and can all be taken care of while showering.&lt;br /&gt;I think the idea of the razor/trimmer is great, the product is top quality... it&#x27;s just not for a person who wants a clean shave all around. I did use the razor for shaving my lady parts, and while the razor is kind of bulky, it still gave me an awesome shave. I would for sure recommend this to a friend!</li>
    <li> Great product, works great and gives you super smooth legs. Trimmer works super good also.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I am part of bzzagent who has graciously sent me this product to try. I love it. You definitely need to try it.The razor side is awesome like butter gliding through to shave the hair off. I stick by Schick products as my razor choice. The trimmer end was originally scary to me because I do not normally touch/shave my bikini area and after I got over that fear I have a neatly groomed bikini area that is perfect and ready for summer. The razor and trimmer are dual ended which saves room in the shower space. It comes with a battery and that can be easily replaced. It is easy to clean the hair off the razor. One thing I found difficult was that because both ends were used I found it hard to place it inside of my shower caddy it just did not fit normally in the razor spot but I made it work. I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love my new razor! I just got it about a week ago from my BzzAgent campaign, and it is by far the best thing that I have ever received! Who knew that free could be so good? I used to use BIC twin razors, but they&#x27;ve found a new home in the trash! I can&#x27;t believe I ever wasted my time and the skin on my legs. After the first use my legs were noticeably softer and without those horrific red bumps! Not one nick or cut. I love that the razor is packed full of moisture and that I don&#x27;t even have to use shaving cream! Now I&#x27;ve just got to keep it hidden from my husband!</li>
    <li> I got this razor to try through bzzagent. With that being said, it&#x27;s a pretty good razor. My only problem that I have with it is that the power button is kind of hard to push to turn it off or on, and to keep it that way. Other than that its a good 2 in 1 razor. I get the close shave without any nicks and It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out which most razors do.</li>
    <li> I got this razor to try out from Bzzagent and it was such a huge gift in my eyes. I love everything about this, the close shave and also the not so close shave. What I mean is I can use this pretty much anywhere and get the desired closeness I need. In some areas I can also use the trimmer for a shave tha&#x27;ts not so close. Which is such an awesome choice because I have sensitive skin in certain areas. This razor is an all in one and I seriously do not know how I survived without it. Go get yourself one.......you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver for free to try from bzzagent and I am so glad I did it is awesome! The shaver part gives a really nice close shave and it has a flexible head so its really easy to get in the curvy areas without cutting myself and the moisturizer beads are awesome they help that I don&#x27;t cut myself as easily and they moisturize my legs enough that I don&#x27;t have to use lotion! The Trimmer part is awesome because it has 3 trim lengths and it is very safe, the white trim length thing also acts like a guard to the blades. Even tho I got this product free to try my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I decided it was time to purchase a new razor, one baby later and after it became a temporary chew toy for our new puppy (thankfully, the pup brought it right to me after he found it). Through BzzAgent I received a sample and have already gone to buy refills in preparation for the summer season. This year is all about swimming and fun in the sun, so silky smooth bikini and legs are a must.  I am love, love, loving the results so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor is a time saver, I get all my business done in 4 short steps. 1) Legs; 2) Armpits; 3) trim the hedge; 4) shave the outer bikini area.  Tada! Bikini ready!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle I had to pull out a on-waterproof razor, pull it in and trim the long hairs. During this process hairs often caught in the razor and left a severe amount of pain or I&#x27;d nick myself while trying to trim around the curves of the bikini zone. This was all the beginning, trimming alone always was a chore I saved for special occasions. After trimming, I used to swap out two razors while in the shower, depending on if my legs needed further moisturizing. I had one to finish off the bikini zone (to remove the remaining hair so I wouldn&#x27;t have to trim again so soon) and the second razor used for legs and armpits, which are typically maintained more frequently.  This process took much longer, and got far too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor hasn&#x27;t caused any pain or nicks since I switched. My legs are silky smooth for days. My bikini zone is ready for summer. And I don&#x27;t have to save Shave-Day for a late night nor schedule it on the calender to make sure I have a babysitter. Just kidding about that last part.  I&#x27;ve saved time, energy, and money by switching and I&#x27;m loving the results. I hope you found this enlightening.</li>
    <li> I received a free Shick Hydrosilk Trim razor from bzzagent.com and I am very happy with the product. I wasn&#x27;t able to use the trimmer because I like to keep things bare but my boyfriend was pleased with it. The moisture bar did its job but it was a better shave if used with shaving cream. I would definitely buy a Shick razor again, maybe not this one since I don&#x27;t need a trimmer but so far this brand is awesome!</li>
    <li> Perfect Razor and comes with Trimmer attached.&lt;br /&gt;I got this razor as a free sample to try by being a Buzz Agent. Im happy I did get it free because I&#x27;m not sure I would of purchased it. The razor leave a closer than close shave and has five blades to give you that kind of shave. It also gives off a very moisturizing feeling to your legs after the shave!i would feel confident to not use any shaving cream! I had zero irritation after using! I normally have some disturbance on my skin so this was wonderful for me! Again I #GotItFree and im happy I was able to! I did not find use for the trimmer, but I love the idea and it&#x27;s there if I ever need. I did have to hold it different because of both ends having a head. The trimmer has differnt settings which is a great variety! The price is great I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying that anyday!</li>
    <li> The trimmer doesn&#x27;t stay on unless you hold the button down</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle about a week ago from BzzAgent and I must say... it is probably one of the best razors I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I relieved the package, it was not only appealing to the eye but also did not require a chainsaw to open. This was a nice change from most other razor packages I have dealt with. The handle was a nice blue color and, since the battery is stored there (just twist the handle in half to open), was bulkier than most I have used. I know some people didn&#x27;t like the bulkiness but personally, I thought the bigger handle made it easier to control while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of shaving... the razor was amazing! I could barely tell it was touching my skin as it effortlessly glided over my legs. It left  them silky smooth to the touch and nicely moisturized. I didn&#x27;t even really need to use shaving cream, like I normally do. I&#x27;ve only used the trimmer twice, once in the shower and once out, and I am not sure I have gotten the hang of it. I set it on the closest setting and it either cut the hair super short or didn&#x27;t seem to cut it at all. I think I have just not figured out how to use it. I still think it works pretty well... and it would be easy to use if you just needed a quick touch-up. The trimmer is also quite easy to clean... just take off the guard and run some water of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you turn on the trimmer, it is a bit loud... but anything that buzzes is going to make quite a bit of noise. If you live in a college dorm... expect someone to possibly ask you what you are doing in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I would highly recommend at least giving this razor a chance. The trimmer might take some use getting use to, if you have never used something like that but I think it has a lot of potential. It only takes one AAA battery, which was a plus since I am a college student that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of money to buy tons of batteries. The razor leaves your legs super smooth and free of razor burn (I consider my skin pretty sensitive... most razors leave me with a little razor burn).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I got the chance to try this razor.. most razors leave me with a little razor burn).  Glad I got the chance to try this razor.</li>
    <li> Does what it says, easy to use and clean and I don&#x27;t need additional shaving cream.</li>
    <li> It gets a very good clean shave. You don&#x27;t need to get it so close to your skin though cause you will cut yourself if you&#x27;re too forceful. Lightly gliding works well for me. As far as the trimmer it works very well for the bikini area and removes a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I was given this product for free to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin. VERY, very sensitive skin. In fact, it&#x27;s so sensitive that I must admit that shaving isn&#x27;t something I do on a very regular basis. I always tend to get red bumps and itchiness, no matter what razor I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I got this product and wasn&#x27;t sure I liked it, but decided to try it anyway. I noticed that it had five blades, which is something I&#x27;ve never used before. I also noticed the trimmer (of course), but other than that, it looked fairly ordinary to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for shaving my legs and it worked great - no red bumps for once! I used it in conjunction with soap (because I had no razor cream available) but it still was completely fine, with no nicks or irritation, which surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And also (how do I put this delicately?) I used the trimmer part for some &amp;#34;ladyscaping&amp;#34; as well. I tried it dry at first, but the trimmer really didn&#x27;t work all that great. I found that it works best in the shower while it&#x27;s wet. It&#x27;s also quite convenient to keep all the mess in one place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say that if you&#x27;re looking for something to do a great job for summer swimsuit grooming, you&#x27;ve found the right product. And if you have sensitive skin, the great razor will just be a bonus.</li>
    <li> Loved this product! I did receive it as a free promotion... and I am glad I did. have had such a horrible time shaving my bikini area in the past. With this razor  I did not have those redbumps that are usually left from other razors. I took this on vacation with me and was so impressed with how it worked as I was in a swimsuit all week. Will definitely have this as my go too in the future.</li>
    <li> The Razor part is just okay. The shave isn&#x27;t the closest i have ever had but its nice and doesn&#x27;t cause a total breakout so the razor side works pretty well. The Trim side is pretty awesome. I like the tiny little trimmer and adore the adjustable comb. However- that being said, The comb is easily lost if you aren&#x27;t careful. Its just so tiny. I love the different lengths i can get and the way i can make things look so tidy. :) Great option for girls who dont want to wax or go bare but want a nice neat look. ( I tried it free through Bzzagent/brand promotion and i have to admit- I would have never bought it myself but now that i have it i do recommend it. Its a great tool!)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve camped out in the &amp;#34;I&#x27;m confused&amp;#34; area of bikini care for a good number of years now. I took on the TrimStyle as a sort of challenge from BzzAgent to figure out what I really like, don&#x27;t like, and probably most important of all, what works! As a trimmer, this thing is pretty phenomenal. It has a versatile head for the difficult crannies, plenty of options to suit your trim closeness preference, and has been literally painless to use on every level. Bikini care is now easy and so fast. I will take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hesitations come in the form of the razor side. While I love that there is just one tool for shaving and trimming that I have to keep track of, I didn&#x27;t love the shaving experience. The strips  that are supposed to provide extra moisture while in use kind of just ooze slimy stuff. I concede that the slime does help get a close shave (yay!) but it was a bit annoying and confusing to figure out where I needed to use soap/shaving cream and thus I came away with some razor burn in places. One more word to its credit: it does amazingly well at getting those dodgy and thin upper thigh hairs. Win.</li>
    <li> Great clean shave and convenient trimmer built in. worked well on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> While I appreciate that it&#x27;s waterproof, the process has been too difficult with wet hair. For those of you that prefer the possibility of trimming and shaving in the shower, this product is fantastic. Surprisingly enough I actually really like the little moisture beads around the razor.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this razor, but then I did. I give this razor a 3/5 the overall shave was not the problem.  The NEW Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® got rid of the hair perfect but the rash that I got from the hypoallergenic moisturizing serum was massive. I have yet to find a razor with a moisture strip that doesn&#x27;t break me out. I love the trimmer though and will continue to use it for that feature. So the close shave was great and the trimmer was awesome but I didn&#x27;t find it very hypoallergenic.&lt;br /&gt;@SchickHydroSilk TrimStyle® #GotItFree</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Normally, I use regular disposable razors, but I received this razor in the mail for free from BzzAgent, so I decided I&#x27;d give it a try. I was skeptical at first, but this razor has really proven itself to me. It gave a close, clean shave, which was the first plus. There is moisturizing serum on the razor, and it ACTUALLY works. It also has a rubber-like grip all around the razor, which comes in handy in the shower. I haven&#x27;t tried the trimmer yet, but the guard is easy to move/remove, and it comes with a battery! Overall, I&#x27;ve had a great experience with this razor/trimmer and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to everyone else.</li>
    <li> I got this one as a sample and i just love it. easy to use. it makes really easy to the bikini area and super smooth!</li>
    <li> This is one of the nicest razors/ trimmers I have bought. I really love the hydro razor heads. When I got the razor it came with the original razor head, when I went to get refills I was excited to find out that Schick Hydro offers &#x27;sensitive&#x27; formula refills. I have ultra sensitive skin so this is a huge plus for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using an older model of the hydro silk and wanted to try out the newest model - I was satisfied! The Schick Hydro Silk razor is ergonomical and effective. It gives a close shave with no discomfort. The older version came with a holder with suction cups which was useful; however, I will recommend this razor to anyone as it allows for quicker and fewer shaves.</li>
    <li> this razor is great its a perfect all in one razor. you get a smooth close shave with the schick hydro razor. i love that its all in one so you dont need any other extra razors. its lightweight and not heavy it take one AAA battery and comes with it. overall a great razor i recived this product free as part of a promotion on this products</li>
    <li> I got this is a free product from BzzAgent. When I received this and tried it, my daughter was 4 weeks old. Having to try and shave for the last couple of months without being able to see was tough! Which meant, I missed quite a few spots. When I tried this for the first time I was in love!! It got the spots that I was missing from not being able to see around my belly with ease! I bought a second one right away to pack in my vacation pile.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this razor!! I got to try it out free as a bzzagent and I will be purchasing only this razor for the forseeable future. I love that it is made for sensitive skin! I had originally started with the HyrdoSilk razor without a bikini trimmer and for the 1st time I was so happy with shaving. Their shaving cream is amazing as well. I have ultra sensitive skin and have always had to use just soap and water. I also have never really used a bikini trimmer but I tried it as part of this campaign and im impressed. I like that it can be used in or out of water and that it is part of the razor itself. Goodness knows us women have to many things in the shower as it is! Im very happy with the razor and am positive you will as well!</li>
    <li> First off, I have to admit: its a good thing I #GotItFree from BzzAgent or else this &#x27;Goddess&#x27; wouldn&#x27;t have tried the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini Trimmer. I would&#x27;ve missed out! Freshly out of the competition&#x27;s refill cartridges, not to mention, low on cash to tip my aesthetician for my monthly bikini wax, the timing of the delivery was impeccable. Excited, I tore open the box and revelled in my new razor before reporting to the shower to do my due diligence in testing it. I spent the better part of an hour grooming and was quite happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually never used a bikini trimmer before, though it wasn&#x27;t difficult by any means. I did get a bit overconfident during trimmage though; moving too quickly resulted in an unexpected pull that left me nervous for my nether regions for the duration of the shower. Nevertheless, the end result was so good that I&#x27;ve since hesitated to call my aesthetician out of fear that my next visit would leave her with the suspicion that I&#x27;d found someone new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely loved the overall smoothness I&#x27;d earned during that hour-long power shower. Still, I missed the trail of moisture (and fresh scent) left behind by my normal razor, who&#x27;s blades seem to be sharper and more effective. Schick&#x27;s trimming tool, though, is a force to be reckoned with and now that I&#x27;m left without refills for either device, the moment-of-truth is fast approaching. Will I become a convert? Only [summer] time will tell!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome razor! Very smooth shave in minutes with 5 razor blades and a hydrating serum strip that made my legs SO silky. This is the best razor I&#x27;ve used- and I&#x27;ve used many- in my 17 or so years of shaving. The trimmer is also a nice add on and the main feature of this razor! Having a trimmer and razor in one makes it oh so simple to get a close shave and a clean bikini line for swimming!</li>
    <li> I really like the trimstyle. It has worked wonders on my legs and bikini line.  My skin feels really smooth and it gives you a really close shave.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a sample.  Awesome way to shave and trim with the same tool!  Close shave and waterproof trimmer is convenient and easy to use in the shower!</li>
    <li> I really liked this razor I got free from Buzzagent. My bikini line did not itch and become bumpy after using this razor. The moisterizer strip was really nice too. Make sure to read the instructions on installing the battery and the adjustable trimmer. Also make sure not to leave the moisturizer strip face down as it stuck to my shower shelf.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let Schick fool you, this isn&#x27;t a new concept at all. I previously owned the quattro Trimstyle, which was a nearly identical product that use Schick&#x27;s older Quattro blade and came with a blade cover and suction cup for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Trimstyle is updated to work with the Hydro Silk blade, which offers a superior performance. The sensitive blade including with this trimmer has a moisturizing strip and is rounded and larger than the Quattro blade. I like it for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the trimmer and the AAA battery, the general handle is thicker. This means the Hydro Silk travel &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t fit, and it doesn&#x27;t fit on hooks in caddies. There are little &amp;#34;feet&amp;#34; on the bottom of the razor to set it on a flat surface, which my shower stall doesn&#x27;t have. The suction cup might have been a nice inclusion with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single button turns on the trimmer, which you can use by itself or with the guide. You&#x27;re not going to get a trim as close as the razor with just the metal trimmer, but the trimmer is easy on your skin. The plastic guide protects your hand from scraping on it if you&#x27;re just using the razor, and you can adjust it to three different lengths, but I don&#x27;t find it to be so precise so I don&#x27;t typically use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to add a design to your pubic hair, you&#x27;ll definitely need to trim to remove length from hair you&#x27;re keeping and then use the razor to do the outlines. Because you still need both, it might not be as convenient as you think, and this is one reason why I just don&#x27;t love the new Trimstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still use it as long as it works, but my original randomly stopped working within a few months, so i don&#x27;t have high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this program for free as part of a review promotion from BzzAgent and Schick.</li>
    <li> First off I received this razor via Bzzagent. I have had it for over a month now and have used it a several times now. The packaging is enticing, love the color and design! It&#x27;s a little on the larger size being that it does house a battery and it&#x27;s a two in one razor, however, it&#x27;s comfortable to hold. The best part is that it leaves my skin super smooth and soft. I get a close shave too which I love. The blades do not irritate my skin, especially since it has these small circles surrounding the blades. When these circles get wet they release a gel like substance which allows the blade to glide smoothly over the surface of the skin and provides protection against razor burn which is very common when using those cheap disposable razors. My legs can go for a week before I have to use it again. I have used it on my arm pits every other day especially since I like going to the gym and no one wants to lift their arms at the gym and show hairy armpits well I know I dont! A nice feature that this razor has is the small perch that&#x27;s attached to it which allows you to set the razor on a flat surface without having the blades touch the surface. My Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor is conveniently perched on my window sill in my shower and I dont have to worry about it touching the shower tiles or the blades soaking in water/moisture and breeding bacteria.The trimmer is great for the bikini area if you want to get a quick trim, mind you I said quick trim so it&#x27;s not really meant to leave you completely hairless. After you use the trimmer you can use the blade side to really get a close and smooth shave! Now you are ready for the beach or pool and that cute bikini! I definitely recommend this awesome trimmer/razor. Your skin will thank you!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from bzzagent and I have gave it to my teenage niece who has autism spectrum disorder to use on her bikini area.  This razor was so easy for her use down there and worked exceptional well for and loves the leg razor part to. She has it leaves her legs baby smooth.  I have since boughten me the razor and I have to agree with her one of the best razors I have used.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is the best part about this razor. I think I would buy it just for that part even if the razor wasn&#x27;t on the other end. However, the razor is equally as nice so it&#x27;s a win-win situation there.  I like this trimmer better than other trimmers I&#x27;ve found because it&#x27;s super small and battery powered. I have another one that is rechargeable, which sounds nice, but not when it&#x27;s never actually charged because I forget all the time. The fact that I can swap out the battery easily to get this thing going again is the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor/trimmer :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful shave everytime. I don&#x27;t even use shaving cream because of the moisturizing strip. It&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever seen from a razor.</li>
    <li> Bought this one for my wife after I used her&#x27;s when i was without  razor. This thing is great.</li>
    <li> Packaged well. Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> I got this razor/trimmer, it&#x27;s the first trimmer I&#x27;ve bought. It worked great, it&#x27;s a little awkward holding it at first, it will take a little getting used to. I even used it to trim my under arms instead of shaving and it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;Someone mentioned that you have to hold the button down the whole time your trimming which isn&#x27;t true, just hold the button for 3 seconds, let go and it stays on (tells you this right in the directions).&lt;br /&gt;No more razor burn! Of course if your a bikini wearer you may want to go over it with once razor afterward.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I bought this for my daughter after laughing at the commercials but it really was just what she needed. Design is iffy with the flip. Take the razor off first! Yikes!</li>
    <li> My GF got this. Its water proof and well....Trims the bush perfectly. Its a solid product!</li>
    <li> I really like how you have two tools in one. Less to carry. Another plus for me, is how easy it is to clean the trimer. You can just snap the off the top and clean it.</li>
    <li> This handy shave and bikini trimmer really worked. I did worried a bit if I would get a cut down my whooha, but end up just fine. But you have to go slow during trimming otherwise pulling hair is not fun at all.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free with buzzagent testing. I love the razor side. It cuts close and my legs stay smooth for days. I enjoy the razor side. It&#x27;s still got a few things that could be improved. The little hydration strips get really sticky with slime Evan if u keep it out of the water most the time. It last 2 days if you leave near the water or shower. It puffs up and than gets hard. If I leave it in the cabinet it tends to last about 3-5 days. The blades stay sharp I can use it for about a month before I Evan need to think about a refill. The handle is a bit thick and is a little awkward to hold at first. Now for the trimmer end. It&#x27;s not for me. For someone used to waxing it just doesn&#x27;t get close enough for me. The instructions says you can use it without the comb but it can Nick you without it. It can really hurt. My friend got one and she loves it. But just not for me. Worth it for th  razor side</li>
    <li> Will never buy again!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, works great</li>
    <li> This trimmer is the best!  It comes with a AAA battery, but the battery has been in storage and transit, so it&#x27;s weak.  With a new battery, the trimmer does a great job.  Call me timid, but I&#x27;ve only used the two longest settings.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer. I just wished they lasted a little longer. I&#x27;m on my second one in under a year. I suppose for 14 dollars it&#x27;s a pretty good deal though.</li>
    <li> I got this for free from BZZAgent.com and I&#x27;m so glad.  I thought that my other razors were good but they can&#x27;t even compare to the close shave that this razor gives.  I really think it&#x27;s the five blades, along with the moisturizing strips, that provide a tug-free, smooth shave.  It&#x27;s easy to grip and I love that I have the choice between the five blades or the bikini trimmer for every nook and cranny of my body.  I won&#x27;t be going back to any other razor again.  It&#x27;s far better than even my husband&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! I used this razor for the first time a few days ago and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. I have sensitive skin but because of the added moisturizer I didn&#x27;t need to use any shaving cream and my legs were left smooth and without irritation. The trimmer was definitely an added bonus and was very easy to use. I would recommend this razor to anyone, it is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I revieved this product as a promotion &amp; I love this product.  It gave A very nice shave. My power button was a little hard to push, but I can live with that. I have always used a Simple razor so holding this one was a little awkward, but I think it&#x27;ll be no problem once I use it another time or two. Its just a little thicker than I am use to. I ended up using the bikini trimmer without the guard because we&#x27;ll the guard didn&#x27;t quite let me get close enough..probably just because my hair  wasn&#x27;t long enough  for the guard. overall  a very great product. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> One of the best razors you could use. I highly recommend to every woman to get one of these. It is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received a free product. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> Thanks to a Bzzz campaign I was able to try this product for free. I had already been using the hydro silk razors and knew I loved them, so I was really excited to try the trimmer/razor combo. It is amazing! So easy to use in or out of the shower. I have used the short and medium guard on the trimmer and both work really well. My husband is glad we don&#x27;t have to share his face trimmer anymore! ;)</li>
    <li> This razor  gives such a wonderfully smooth feeling it makes you want to show off your legs. I love  that it comes with a battery and  is easy to assemble  and change blades.</li>
    <li> I recieved the schick hydro silk trimstyle courtesy of bzz agent for testing purposes and in my opinion it is amazing!!!! This razor makes and keeps my legs soft and the trimmer is awesome it has a precise shave and does not irritate my sensitive skin. I love this razor and i highly recommend this for anyone!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of razors throughout the years but Schick has always been one of my favorites and this razor is no different! The 5 blades help give me the closest shave and the gel helps keep my skin soft and protected of nicks, the trimmer can be used either dry or wet and makes grooming the bikini zone a breeze! I may have got it free from Bzzagent but even if I didn&#x27;t I&#x27;d have given it a shot in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I got the opportunity to try this razor/trimmer out. It&#x27;s really hard for me to find a women&#x27;s razor but this one works absolutely wonderfully. I love it&#x27;s hydrating serum that allows you to have a very close shave and I am in love with the razor. I rate this razor a 10/10. I do wish it came with a shower stick on accessory like the old one did, it was so helpful! I recommend it to women who like a long lasting shaving and have sensitive skin.  I never received razor bumps with this product so far.  It is a beautiful razor!!! #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. The razor started to rust after not too long, but the blade was a little dull at that point so there was no problem changing it out anyway. Never had a problem with rust with my Schick Quattro, so not sure what that was about. Love the trimmer!</li>
    <li> 4 start because did not like the trimmer.. did not work for me..</li>
    <li> Love this...it&#x27;s so easy to use and for someone that has a bad back, very convenient. ...would recommend</li>
    <li> Very nice helps prevent razor bumps from shaving with a traditional razor.</li>
    <li> I got this razor free from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the regular Schick Hydro Silk razor for about a year now (which I also got free from BzzAgent), so I was already familiar with that half of this razor. It works well, doesn&#x27;t leave razor bumps, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and leaves a nice, clean, even shave.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try the TrimStyle half because I am not exactly a fan of taking care of my bikini area. It&#x27;s often time consuming and tedious, so I figured the electric razor might make the process more streamlined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic top of the razor, which is supposed to adjust to three different lengths, seemed to get in the way if the hair on your bikini area is a bit too long. Which is understandable, but I didn&#x27;t have anything crazy going on. I don&#x27;t want to have to trim it before I trim it. I eventually decided to just take off the plastic top all together and try to be careful, which worked better, but took a bit more focus to get an even shave. Definitely easier than a conventional razor, but not as easy as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely have to experiment with it more in the future, but I will still choose this over a conventional razor for my bikini area. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the $25-30.</li>
    <li> I got this razor just as summer was hitting for free from Bzzagent but all opinions are my own. The packaging was very well done, professional, eye catching and descriptive. After opening it was very easy to install the battery. My only complaint with the packaging is the I wish the the To use/care instructions came on a lose paper instead of printed on the back of the box. The handle has a good grip making it easy to use when wet. However the handle is a little thicker then i like. Which makes it hard to trim with at some angles. However I am not sure if its possible to make it thinner with the current battery. The stand they added to it is perfect! I wish my regular razor came with it so that when you lay it flat the blades/moisturizing gel  don&#x27;t touch the surface and get dirty/ruined. The button to turn on the trimmer is a little temperamental. You have to hold it down hard to get it to stay on. I loved the razor with the moisturizing serum, gives a nice clean and soft shave that does not leave my skin irritated. The four in one TrimStyle is a really cool concept but I feel like the difference between the 4 steps are not quire large enough to really make a big difference. So in the end I just used the trimmer with out a guard and the number 4 step. Also the trimmer with out the guard does not quite get close enough so you still need to go over it with the plain razor blade as well.  So its not a perfect trimmer but its does a decent job for the price.</li>
    <li> i got this razor free from bzzagent and its by far one of the best razors that i have used.</li>
    <li> I got this from bzzagent for free, and they work with Schick to make this promotion possible and I fell in love with this!  It left my legs super smooth and I love the adjustable comb.</li>
    <li> Received a free product Loved it! Shortened my routine time and i loved the easy to hold grip! I got this product for free as a sample!</li>
    <li> I received this as a bzzagent for free. Simply this is the absolute best razor out there! Its waterproof all in one razor and trimmer is so easy to use! I remove the razor head while trimming but you certainly don&#x27;t have to. Its has different settings to adjust the trimmer comb too! This is a must have product!! Who doesn&#x27;t love a product that leaves you smooth?!</li>
    <li> The best I really like it it was my first  good raiser i always use  the disposable raisers really a great product for the summer  you could take it every where you go  when you need a little bit of more help. Also you just need one battery for one side and for the other you don&#x27;t need it was great  and its water safe with it  one of the best products for a first timer in a great product.</li>
    <li> Did I just sit on a cactus? Nope, it&#x27;s my leg and bikini area hair feeling sharper than a prickly pear. I have always hated shaving because the razors I use, give me razor burn, or I miss hair, and have to spend 15 minutes going over and over my legs and don&#x27;t even get me started on how long it takes to get every nook and cranny of my bikini area to be hair free. It&#x27;s like a LABYRINTH down there! I got my new free Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle razor in the mail about a week ago, and I did an experiment. I shaved my right leg with my normal disposable razor (a new one) and Silk shaving cream. Then, I shaved my left leg with the new Hydro Silk, no shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The right leg was the same as always: a bit painful, got some razor burn, missed some hair, and spent about 5-8 minutes trying to get everything smooth. I shaved my left leg with my new Hydro Silk, and OMG so much better!! I didn&#x27;t regret not using shaving cream, and my leg was SOOOOO much smoother feeling with whatever awesome lotion they have in the razor head. I have sensitive skin, so shaving usually means soreness, redness, and stinging. So, as far as the razor goes, this new product gets 5 stars from me! However, overall, I have to give 4 stars. Here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try out the new battery operated bikini end of the Schick Hydro Silk. I&#x27;d never used an electronic bikini shaver before. There are three lengths you can set the white plastic razor guard to so you can pick your hair length. I tried all three settings, and I even took off the guard and tried using the razor that way, but for the life of me I couldn&#x27;t get it to work in my bikini hair area. It could have been that my hair was already too short, but I was a little disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t get it to shave like I wanted. HOWEVER, even though I couldn&#x27;t get it to work for it&#x27;s intended purpose, I again decided to experiment. Some of you may think I&#x27;m crazy but oh my goodness, the electronic &amp;#34;bikini&amp;#34; shaver works AMAZINGLY well for trimming/removing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Arm hair&lt;br /&gt;2. EYEBROW (yes Eyebrow) hair (not recommended if you don&#x27;t have steady hands)&lt;br /&gt;3. Trimming up any unwanted facial hair (female sideburn hair for example)&lt;br /&gt;4. Boyfriend/Fiance/Husband beard trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I will be using my new Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle razor for everything now, and I DO highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a convenient all in one razor for just about any hair on their body. I will be using the manual razor end for my bikini area, legs, and underarms, but the electric end will be my go to for everything else. :) Thanks for the great product! I love being a BzzAgent, and I loved receiving this free new product to try from Schick. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - I realize that this review makes it sound like I am a hairy gorilla, but I am not.

    <li> Recently received this razor as a trial through bzz agent, so I did not purchase. I typically use the venus razor. I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the trimmer for the bikini area because it didn&#x27;t really get the closeness that I wanted and I wouldn&#x27;t have felt comfortable in a bathing suit. I used the closest setting and I felt that it didn&#x27;t get anywhere near close enough. Another negative for me was the shape/design of the razors handle. The handle is very bulky and its hard to compare it to something but the closest comparison that I can make is to a very thick pencil. With the battery it is pretty heavy also. There is no shape to the design. Another issue I had was that (prior to reading the instructions) the button to turn the trimmer on was not staying on so I thought that you would have to hold the button down while shaving which would just add to the awkwardness of the razor. You don&#x27;t have to hold the button but you do have to push the button harder then would be expected.  razor on the other hand was wonderful!! It has a moisturizing strip that left my legs feeling AMAZING!!! I shaved as I normally do, every other day with shaving cream and with the moisturizer my legs never felt smoother! The razor gave me such a close shave that I had very minimal stubble before my next shave! In short I loved the razor but would not recommend the trimmer.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got this in the mail Tuesday I used it the same day! The battery came included- yes!  I like the fact that it has a nice grip so its easier to hold while taking a shower without worrying about it slipping through your fingers.  My legs felt very smooth afterwards, no itch or irritation.  The bikini trimmer - one word- awesome!  I admit I didn&#x27;t read the directions I just assumed if you press the button it&#x27;ll stay on but it didn&#x27;t. I found out I didn&#x27;t press down hard enough and it worked just fine LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Anyway, I love how you can just lay it flat on your sink counter and the blade doesn&#x27;t touch the sink and having the guard on the end keeps the trimmer from touching. In addition to being a bikini trimmer I find it works great for arching eyebrows, uni-brows or that unwanted upper lip hair. I will be purchasing more cartridges, this is my new fave I&#x27;ll definitely be using this all summer! I wish it came in a different color like purple - not like color is important, just my preference, I have no other complaints, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I received this for free from BzzAgent and I love getting free stuff and telling people how great or not so great some of the products are that I get to try out. If you like getting free stuff follow the link to become a Bzzagent!! http://u.bzz.com/qfm3x</li>
    <li> I just used this razor after receiving it free to try from bzzagent and Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle and it is truly amazing!! Hands down the best razor I have ever used and on top of that there is a trimmer too! You could feel how smooth your legs were going to be as you were shaving! I have only used Venus razor until now and I will not go back! This razor/trimmer 2-in-1 is amazing! Thank you bzzagent and Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It does the job very well and leaves your skin very smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> To start I would love to thank Bzzagent for allowing me to try out this product! As I had already been using the hydro silk razors and knew I loved them, so I was really excited to try the trimmer/razor combo. It is amazing! So easy to use in or out of the shower. I have previously been using the men&#x27;s version of this razor the Stick Hydro 5 Groomer. And it got the job done but this combo is now the only razor I will need!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews. NEVER. But I really needed to talk about this razor. I&#x27;ve been a long time user of the disposable version of Hydro Silk, but the additional trimmer is an added bonus. I did receive this product for free to review but honestly, I would have purchased this for myself. The shave from the razor is incredibly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some might find the weight of the razor to be a bit heavy, I found that I preferred it. It&#x27;s easy to grip, even while in the shower. If you like a close shave, this is the razor for you.</li>
    <li> Got this for free from BzzAgent - I highly recommend! It makes shaving a breeze. You can take care of your bikini line all at once and very easily.</li>
    <li> I received The Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor to try for free thanks to bzzagent. I am so glad that I did because it truly is an amazing razor. Let me start by the packaging. It was very easy to remove from the box. Which is always a bonus! When I first used the razor I was amazed! The handle is much thicker than the usual razor. But it proved to be easier to use. The thicker handle was easier to control. There was no slipping when it was wet. Thanks to the five curve sensing blades, I got a very close and smooth shave. There is a moisturizing strip which left my skin so soft! I usually end up with red bumps after I shave. Not this time! The trimmer was just as amazing. It was precise and pain free. I was a little worried about pulling but it didn&#x27;t! I also like the adjustable comb to choose the length that I wanted. Another great feature is this whole razor including the trimmer is waterproof. Makes it convenient and easy to use in the shower! I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone!</li>
    <li> I got this product as a sample in the mail and I love it already! I will never use another razor like this. Not only is the razor itself exceptional because it provides a smooth, close shave it also didn&#x27;t give me nicks or cuts that most other razors do. I was able to shave with it without the use of expensive shaving cream since it has two aloe strips on the top and bottom of the blades. The waterproof part of the razor comes in use with the bonus added bikini trimmer which can be used in OR out of the shower! The razor is made with durable materials (I know, I accidentally dropped it) and is of a sturdy design. It&#x27;s not flimsy like a normal disposable razor and has a great grip on it which is awesome since I always drop the razors because they are thin. It&#x27;s got some weight to it which is nice and make it easier to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never switch razors again!</li>
    <li> I received the Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor thanks to Schick Hydro Silk and Bzzagent. I was excited to try this out. I have very sensitive skin and very dark brown hair. Typically NOT a good combination. I used this razor with only water to really get the best idea of how well it works. The result was smooth skin and no irritation. The moisturizing strips and the skin guards really performed as advertised! I tried the trimmer next and the adjustable comb is perfect. It was not awkward or hard to use in any way. Best part? Again, no razor burn or bumps!</li>
    <li> Best razor ever!! I received a free one from bzzzagent and absolutely love it. First off when I opened it I was so excited it&#x27;s not only stylish but isn&#x27;t flimsy like other razors can be. Legs silky smooth after shaving no irritation!</li>
    <li> Ok so I&#x27;m a big fan of Schick Hydro Silk, so I was excited to try their Trimstyle razor when I received a free trial from my recent bzzagent campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should start by saying why I love Schick Hydro Silk...&lt;br /&gt;1. I hate shaving, HATE IT.. so I need it to be as easy as possible which means I hate doing the whole shaving cream routine, plus I just don&#x27;t think you get as close of a shave with it.  That said, thanks to Schick Hydro Silk I don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream because of their moisturizing serum! LOVE LOVE LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;2. To me, a razor with only 2-3 blades is no razor at all.  Schick Hydro Silk has 5. Enough said.&lt;br /&gt;3. No razor burn &#x3D; happy girl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW, on to the battery operated bikini end.  I&#x27;ve never used a bikini shaver before so the whole white plastic thing looked foreign to me.. So i turn it on and try to use it but nothing happens. Still hairy.  From there I decide that maybe I should look up directions... that&#x27;s when I learned about the 3 settings you can use... I tried all 3 and even took the white plastic off but still couldn&#x27;t get it to work in my bikini area.  Could be because my hair is already short, but regardless I wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable going out in my bikini with that length of hair showing so I wasn&#x27;t too impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, even though I couldn&#x27;t get it to work for it&#x27;s intended purpose, I did find some areas where it actually DOES work pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;1. Trimming any unwanted facial or body hair (ex:female sideburns, happy trail, etc.) I&#x27;m sure it would work for arm hair or eyebrows but I didn&#x27;t want to try.&lt;br /&gt;2. Boyfriend/Fiance/Husband beard trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said... I&#x27;ll probably just continue using the Schick Hydro Silk razor for shaving my legs, armpits, and bikini area.  I think the Trimstyle razor has some positive things it can do but since I don&#x27;t really have a need for any of the additional uses I uncovered I won&#x27;t be switching to the Trimstyle razor full-time.  For that reason I&#x27;ll be giving it 4 stars.  If you have any need for the additional uses section I definitely recommend this product!I&#x27;ll be giving it 4 stars.  If you have any need for the additional uses section I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am fairly over all very pleased with this product. The hydration it provides while shaving is quite amazing. The close shave it provides is awesome. The trimmer part comes in handy. I shaved 3 days ago &amp; my legs are still smooth. LOVE this product :)</li>
    <li> I received this razor for FREE from BzzAgent. All statements and opinion are 100% my own. The razor was great it gave me smooth,soft legs. My legs felt so moisturized after and it gave such a close shave perfect razor. However The trimmer is not for me at all i don&#x27;t let that area get very long maybe 1/3 of inch max. The trimmer even with out the guide comb did nothing it didn&#x27;t trim or cut any of the hairs. I don&#x27;t have thin hair at all so if you have thick hair with a lot of volume it may work a lot better but as for me this is not a product i will be purchasing due to the trimmer not working for me i would just rather purchase the hydro silk razors with out the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Was a little gunky with the gel on the razor head at first, the second use was a lot better, but other than that this is a great product, #GotItFree from BzzAgent. i didnt quite get the idea of the trimmer at first, but after initial use, it helped having it. :)</li>
    <li> I didnt purchase the product i got it free from bzzagent. Its really awesome. The fact that it actually comes with a trimmer and a razor is really badass. Only issue, if you have REALLY sensitive skin be careful because the  moisturizer might irritate your legs, besides that its a really good product and i totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Literally the best razor I have owned. I received it as a free trial and plan to be a customer. I used to buy men&#x27;s razors because the women&#x27;s razors tugged too much/didn&#x27;t give a close enough shave in the bikini area. This razor is awesome. I really like the trimmer because it shortens the hair so that you can get a much smoother, close shave. The hypoallergenic gel bar surrounding the blades helps the razor glide really easily, which means no tugging.</li>
    <li> the trimmer on this, is my favorite. I was sad that my old trimstyle broke, and my new trimmer wasn&#x27;t doing it for me, so when buzzagent sent me this, I was over joyed. The blades are wonderful, I can easily just this for 5 to 8 shaves. As for the trimmer, my old one worked like new, for over a year (until I broke it).</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!! I could not be more excited every time I have to shave now! Since receiving this product through Bzzagent, I will never go back to any razor I have used in the past!! I HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone I know!!</li>
    <li> So I got this free from BzzAgent to try and review. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay for it! The razor itself is fantastic. Moisture strip is great and got a smooth shave. The trimmer was horrible. The plastic guard was so hard to remove and adjust and a pain to do in the shower. It&#x27;s too loud and buzzy and just annoying. I would purchase razors by themselves but not impressed with the trimmer. Needs major improvement.</li>
    <li> this razor is a godsend prior to using this, all of the other razors I have used in the past did not come close to this one but now that I have used this one, this is going to be on my shopping list for a while. It gives a smooth shave and the trimmer is excellent thanks bzzagent for letting me try this for free</li>
    <li> My favorite razor/trimmer i have ever tried. Didnt have the irritation that i normally get after shaving. Its also very practical  with the duel sides. Makes life easy</li>
    <li> I received my 2-in-1 Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor(as promotion from brand) and I am absolutely in love! It is the perfect all in one tool for any woman! On one end you have your 5 blade razor with a very flexible head that flows and moves nicely with the contour of your legs and the other side is your bikini trimmer that has 4 length adjustments on the comb. I love the way it felt in your hand and how easy it was to use. The razor end has a moisturizing type strip which I enjoyed because my legs are sensitive and they stayed nice and silky throughout the whole shave! I was a little skeptical about the bikini trimmer end at first because I have had some not so great experiences, but I was pleasantly surprised! No nicks, no burn, no bumps-just easy, comfortable and smooth! It was soo easy to adjust the height and remove the comb attachment so I could adapt when needed. And it comes with a battery, so you don&#x27;t even have to worry about picking some up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been stealing my husband&#x27;s razors for years in search of a smoother shave. I was happy to try out this product as part of a market research project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a trial of this product and my normal go to: the Gilette Fusion Power. My left leg got the standby, my right this product. I tried the moisturizer on each side of the razor as my lubricant instead of shaving cream first. For legs, even without soap or shaving cream this razor glides great. Hair grow was a day ahead of the Gilette though.&lt;br /&gt;The razor head for the Shick is wide and you use less strokes, with the Gilette I have to make shorter movements. Three days after the shave, though I feel prickly my skin feels less rough on the left.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is amazing. I used it on my husband&#x27;s neck and sideburns because I was terrified to have clippers basically near my lady bits. It looks like he went to the barber. I then tried it on my bikini line to take care of stray hairs regular shaving missed. I suggest pulling your skin taut.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right, but I thought the guard was pointless and flimsy and didn&#x27;t transition from each level all that great.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product and I don&#x27;t steal hubby&#x27;s razor anymore</li>
    <li> #BzzAgent #GotitFree  I love the close shave I get and the trimmer is perfect!</li>
    <li> Received the razor as part of a bzz campaign. I love this razor! Fits in my hands comfortably. One side I can use to trim. Only needs one aaa battery. Then flip it overall use it to shave. I can do this all conviently in the shower. One thing I didn&#x27;t like was residue I got from the strips.</li>
    <li> This razor has totally converted me from disposable razors.  I didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing all this time.  It was originally kind of weird using a razor that needs a battery and vibrates, but I&#x27;ve never had a closer shave and smoother legs even the next day.  The hydrating ring that surrounds the blades makes it amazingly smooth so your legs aren&#x27;t irritated post-bathing and yet protects from accidental cuts.  The other end of the razor is also going to be really nice to use now that summer and bikini season are approaching!</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle free through bzzagent. I was excited to get it and try it out. I was very pleased that it arrived 2 days beforey dreaded annual female appt. If I wasn&#x27;t anxious for my exam to be over I would have told my dr all about my Hydro Silk Trimstyle but that just seemed a little awkward. Anyways, my initial impression is it is a little bigger abs heavier than my normal razors but they don&#x27;t have a waterproof trimmer attached so I can get over that. I can&#x27;t imagine using the trimmer in the shower I try to avoid clogging my drains but I guess some people don&#x27;t worry about that. The trimmer was easy to use. With the guard on I felt very comfortable using it. With the guard off it was a little scary but if you are careful you should be fine. The guard offers different settings to adjust the length, it was easy to use. I don&#x27;t like the shorter settings the result was uncomfortable to be (shorter, prickly hair). The razor side was great it offered a close comfortable shave that seemed to last longer than some. Overall I am pleased with my Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle, not sure I would have tried it had I not gotten it free.</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand &amp; to try.. and I used it bout a couple times now &amp; I have to say the style of this is very sleek, the grip seems to form to my hand very nice, the packaging seemed to open pretty easily not always common for some products, battery was a good bonus with the waterproof seal for it, adjustment comb does its job &amp; last it washes off quite easily.. :)</li>
    <li> I received the schick hydro silk trimstyle to test n review n i luv it! it kept my legs silky smooth and i didn&#x27;t have to shave the same spot over n over. #GOTITFREE @SCHICKHYDROSILK</li>
    <li> I got this Schick Hydro Trinstyle shaver for free from Bzzagent to try out and review with everyone . I love this shaver its gets right to the pore and makes my skin really move like a baby bottom :) The trimer part is good too if you like your hairs trim but me I like it bold so I use the shaver part and it made it nice and smooth also .</li>
    <li> Sily Smooth is how im feeling after using this razor. After a long winter on not saving as often as i should haha I received a bzz campaign for this razor. I absolutely love it, normally with new razors i ALWAYS cut my legs while shaving and I was surprised that this was just as smooth on my leg to shave with as it left my legs feeling. I highly recommend this razor to anyone and everyone</li>
    <li> I generally like to keep a clean shave, so I wouldn&#x27;t normally buy this product for myself as I feel the main reason someone may buy this over another razor is for the trimmer. However, I was very excited when I got the bzzkit offer for this razor, and I wanted to give the best review possible so I didn&#x27;t shave for about 2 weeks-legs, underarms, or bikini area. Now before this began I was already using the Shick Hydro disposable razors, and was very satisfied, I like razors with 4+ blades and a moisture strip, for a close shave without razor burn. So this morning I tried out my free razor and trimmer. I first tried the trimmer outside of the shower, it was a little awkward to use but I account that to being in my 9th month of pregnancy and everything being awkward, it did what it was supposed to do. I think if the user were not in the third trimester and did not keep a clean shave, this is an amazing option and does what its supposed to do, with no irritation. The blade itself is small enough to be able to control it easily and I feel that if you wanted to you could do some intricate bikini area art with it. It&#x27;s just not my thing, so I moved on to the shower. It shaved my underarms exactly the way I expected and worked just as well as the disposable Shick Hydro. Continuing on, I tried to shave my bikini area, again this was awkward, but more so than when using the disposable, the handle was unusually thick and strange to hold, halfway through I switched back to the disposable to finish the job. Moving on to my legs, I expected this to shave exactly like the disposable with a different handle, when using on my legs the handle was not awkward at all, I liked the extra weight, however, the shave did not feel the same as the disposable, it felt a little rough and dragged along my leg, which is not the case for the disposable version which glides along and feels very hydrating. I feel like if I were to continue to use this product to shave my legs I would HAVE to use shaving cream, which I don&#x27;t usually do. After the fact though I do not have any razor burn, so I&#x27;m not sure what the drag was that I was feeling, and I do have a smooth close shave. Overall I think the product works well, and does exactly what it is meant to do. As far as the design goes, I really like the color and size of the razor, while it was a bit awkward on my labybits, I account that to the pregnancy, as I enjoyed the weight while shaving my legs. I also like the little kick stand to keep the razor off the surface it&#x27;s been placed on, and I will point out the disposables has this as well. I&#x27;m not sure why the disposable razor of the same brand felt more hydrating to me, but if I were into a different shave the trimmer is an excellent thing, and using shaving cream a small sacrifice. It just isn&#x27;t for me though and I will continue to buy and use the disposable Shick Hydro razors. I would recommend this to any lady friends who could use the trimmer option though as I still feel that is the number one feature for this product.aving cream, which I don&#x27;t usually do. After the fact though I do not have any razor burn, so I&#x27;m not sure what the drag was that I was feeling, and I do have a smooth close shave. Overall I think the product works well, and does exactly what it is meant to do. As far as the design goes, I really like the color and size of the razor, while it was a bit awkward on my labybits, I account that to the pregnancy, as I enjoyed the weight while shaving my legs. I also like the little kick stand to keep the razor off the surface it&#x27;s been placed on, and I will point out the disposables has this as well. I&#x27;m not sure why the disposable razor of the same brand felt more hydrating to me, but if I were into a different shave the trimmer is an excellent thing, and using shaving cream a small sacrifice. It just isn&#x27;t for me though and I will continue to buy and use the disposable Shick Hydro razors. I would recommend this to any lady friends who could use the trimmer option though as I still feel that is the number one feature for this product.</li>
    <li> I got this razor to try out through BzzAgent. It is a great razor and I love the hydrating feature. It definitely leaves your legs really smooth. I have tried the trimmer feature and at this point I am not totally sold on that feature. It is definitely easy to use, but it doesn&#x27;t have the same closeness as using a razor does. There is an adjustable plate, the same as you would find on a pair of clippers you might shave your husbands head with. I am not sure the purpose of including both of those with the trimmer. Overall, it is a great razor, I am not sure I would have paid $24 for it though. As I mentioned, I am trying it for free through BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk trimstyle razor from Bzzagent for free and I love it. I really like the handle, it feels different and have nice grip no need to worry that I might drop it. I love that I can use the trimmer in and out of the shower. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the razor doesn&#x27;t have cover, I was nervous that I might cut myself while using the trimmer. Overall it&#x27;s a great product and I would definitely suggest it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I started out my adventure with the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle with high hopes. The trimmer/razor combination is shower friendly, the brand is well known, and the overall design feels nice in your hand. I was especially impressed with the simplest feature - there is a little plastic triangle shape on the handle, it has one job, to keep your razor blade from sitting on the counter/in water. It&#x27;s so perfect, I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s not standard practice to have that feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the usability? Iffy at best on the trimmer. If your hair is a little less densely populated in the area you&#x27;re shaving, it&#x27;s pretty useless. I guess if you&#x27;re starting from a long growth time, it would save your razor blade some hard work, but for general upkeep, it&#x27;s not all that helpful. It is good at trimming densely populated hair with a better degree of finesse than regular clippers, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor part of this duo is much more universally usable. It&#x27;s a pretty standard multiblade razor with moisture strip. The moisture strip is large enough to make maneuvering in sensitive areas challenging. Which is beyond frustrating in a razor designed to help you groom those areas. It gives a close shave... and then some. Some razors are just more nick prone than others and,  unfortunately, this is one of those. Something about the way the blades sit just make me more likely to get cut. This time It was where my shin and foot meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - I got a good shave from the razor. The trimmer isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;ll work for me. I like the idea, love the overall design, but would like to see it trimmed down a bit for better use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try this product for free, courtesy of Schick, as part of a #BzzAgent Bzz Campaign. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I received the item as I thought it was supposed to come with suction cup for the shower to hang it on.  I guess this was my error :(</li>
    <li> I have used Schick razors (both disposable and cartridges) for years now, so I was excited to try this new razor and bikini trimmer combo for free thanks to BzzAgent. At first glance I thought it was a great product. The convenience of having a two-in-one razor is very appealing. The waterproof trimmer is nice, as it can just be left in the shower. Upon using it for the first time, however, I had a different opinion. The razor part, as with most other Schick razors I&#x27;ve tried, is great. It gives me a close shave without even having to use shaving cream. The trimmer part doesn&#x27;t give me a close enough shave around my bikini area, even when not using a guard. My biggest complaint is the bulkiness of the handle. I use it primarily as razor, so the huge handle just makes it annoying. I, unfortunately, will be switching back to my old razor!</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor and bikini trimmer to try and let me start by saying I will not ever use another razor again. The blades on this work so nice for a smooth clean cut every time. This was the first razor I didn&#x27;t even have to use shaving cream for. It has a great design and its heavy at all. Now the best part about this is that it has the trimmer on the other side of the razor. The trimmer is perfect size works fantastic. You can use it in the shower without worrying about ruining it. The trim has different settings you can use it on. This is by far the best thing to come out yet.</li>
    <li> The combination battery powered trimmer and razor is an excellent idea. When first looking at the contraption it can seem overwhelming, but the instructions and tips on the box were very helpful. In particular, I was pressing the button to turn on the trimmer and I had to hold it down keep it in operation, so I looked at the instructions on the box and it specifically said that you should not need to hold down the button to operate the trimmer. I pressed the button more firmly and held for a second longer and the trimmer remained operational without constantly holding down the button. The 5 razor and moisturizing strip combination made for a nice clean shave, however, I was disappointed that the blades seemed to dull sooner than expected. Overall I would consider it a very good product and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> So I got this razor in the mail thanks to BzzAgent for free ! So that I could test it out - Love how smooth my legs are after using this razor ! I had no cuts like I usually do &amp; I still got that close shave ! Love ! Love ! Love !</li>
    <li> I got one for free through bzzagent and I was surprised at how well it works. I usually go for cheap razors so this was a luxurious experience. The packaging was really nice and easy to open. It includes a battery which is very convenient. I&#x27;ll admit I didn&#x27;t use shaving cream and my skin felt incredibly soft after. It&#x27;s a bit bigger than other razors but it has a nice grip. I don&#x27;t really use trimmers but i experimented with it and it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> First of all, I am a long term user of disposable razors. I go for cheap and bulk, even though they are junky and only last a few weeks until I have to get another one. But when I found out I was getting a Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini Trimmer for free to try from BzzAgent.com, I was excited. As soon as I got it, I put the battery in that came with the device, and I immediately went in the shower. The razor is very sharp and easily takes off the hair on your legs and armpits. When I&#x27;ve used the disposable cheap razors, I&#x27;ve had to go over the area multiple times until the hair had gotten off. This, I go over once and it takes off all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then used the bikini trimmer and it was so easy. There are several levels you can adjust it to. The only downside of the razor is the fact that the &amp;#34;Water-activated conditioning serum for moisturization&amp;#34; comes out too much and when you go to shave, it&#x27;s very thick and stringy. It makes it a little difficult to see if you&#x27;ve shaved a part. However, it is very soft and moisturizing. I wish there was a way to choose how much serum you wanted to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am in love with this little razor and bikini trimmer. I think I am done with disposable razors and will continue to buy replacements for this device.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this razor thanks to Schick.  I got this product for free from Schick to test and share my opinion and it&#x27;s holding up pretty well.  It&#x27;s effective, the grip is great and so is the look.  I enjoy that the blades are sharp and they do get the job done.  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it is a little slimy due to the lubrication strip.  I wish there was a way to get rid of that but otherwise, I really enjoy it.  Thanks Schick!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great quality for great price. Love the way skin feel after it. And it&#x27;s perfect for sensitive areas</li>
    <li> This razor is so perfect for summer! As a mom of 3 young children, getting in and out of the shower as fast as possible, and getting fully groomed is almost impossible! This razor had me in and out of the shower in less than 15 mins. and my legs have never felt smoother! The bikini trimmer had my bikini zone &amp;#34;cleaned up&amp;#34; before I needed to rinse out my conditioner. I received this razor as part of a promotion from Schick for free. Let&#x27;s just say that it exceeded my expectations by far!</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® razor provides an easy shave all with a soft and moisturized finish.&lt;br /&gt;Used in and out of the shower, the razor is easily accesible and easy to use</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome! The two in one is great, and while immer I love the regular razor side, it&#x27;s the trimmer side that really makes me love the product. I have far less red bumps and irritation with the trimmer, and is so easy to use. Got this free as a sample from buzz agent... definitely would purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m practical. And a 2-in-1 razor/trimmer sounded practical to me even though I had no idea how to use a trimmerso I signed up for the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor campaign through BzzAgent. Allow me to fill you in on my first impressions, razor usage and trimmer usage. I am BzzAgent Angneld.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions: The packaging was nice and I didn&#x27;t have to get out a chainsaw to open it. The razor is a bit chunkier than a typical razor, but it has a sturdy manageable feel. It made me happy to see that a battery was included with it to run the trimmer. To get the battery in, I recommend putting the flat part of the battery in first then twisting the razor together. Hidden under the cardboard back insert were helpful pics and instructions on the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor usage: The razor part shaves nice and close, leaving my legs feel smooth and moisturized. It did miss some random patches of hair even though I went over most areas twice. Also, every time I rinsed the blades out in the ... Read more</li>
    <li> I have a splint up to my knee I can&#x27;t remove and this is way better than wasting a box of trash bags every week to maybe have no leaks. It&#x27;s a little tricky to stretch on past a tender broken ankle, but once it&#x27;s over, you&#x27;re golden. It&#x27;s a bit tight but that&#x27;s what keeps the water out so well. It feels pretty durable (it&#x27;s like the vinyl material they make inflatable pools out of) and what I like is that it&#x27;s reusable. And when I&#x27;m healed I can hold onto this and pull it out or give it away in case of emergency. Now I&#x27;m a pretty heavy woman myself, so if it fits me comfortably, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll fit all shapes and sizes.</li>
    <li> Quality product at a great price.  I had seen the commercial on TV and was interested in trying it.  I am quite pleased with the way it handles the contours of hard to reach areas in sensitive areas.  My husband has used the trimmer for manscaping and is also pleased with how easy it is to use.  Made to use in the shower and comes with battery included.  I highly recommend this razor/trimmer.</li>
    <li> Love it met my expectations!  Would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Shave is very comfortable</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have this in your life I don&#x27;t know how your surviving! I absolutely love both ends of the razor and trimer</li>
    <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t do all it claims to do. I bought it for my teenage daughter. It was no better than any other razor for the bikini area.</li>
    <li> I do my own Brazilian wax but leave a small landing strip. This is perfect to keep the strip short and well groomed. The razor is awesome for shaving my legs.</li>
    <li> Works great- especially the electric razor.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shaver!! Would recommend every woman to have one.</li>
    <li> This shaver is awesome!! You get such a close and smooth shave!</li>
    <li> It is good idea but not my favorite design. I think the handle is what throws it off for me. I wouldnt use it as an everyday item but would definitely get it wjen going on vacation. Btw,I received this from bzzagent to try out!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift from the manufacturer to try out. I absolutely love it. Let&#x27;s be honest... Shaving is a chore. It&#x27;s NEVER fun. The trim style makes it quick and easy to obtain the result you desire. I&#x27;m always moving... Rarely get the chance to relax, so I need a razor that can keep up with me. Both ends of the razor are equally efficient. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I got the schick trimstyle as a sample to try for free but all opinions of the product is my own Trimestyle is a two in one razor and trimmer not only that it&#x27;s also waterproof! So you can do all the grooming in the shower it saves time and is just simply convenient . The first time I used it I kept pressing on the power button by mistake it took me a while to get a good grip on it , the trimmer is not very powerful but it does the job good and unique product</li>
    <li> So far I am pretty please with the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor that I received for free thanks to bzzagent.com! The trimmer works great. I love that it has multiple settings, and the fact that it is water proof so I can use it in the shower with the rest of my shaving/grooming routine is awesome! The actually razor is pretty good too. The only reason I&#x27;m not classifying it as great is the hydration strip. The hydration strip (or built in lotion/moisturizer) was great the first few times that I used it. It seemed to react to the water, and even expand a bit. I really didn&#x27;t even need to use shaving cream or gel and still got a really smooth hydrating shave. But after using it a few times, the strip/moisturizer got kid of sticky, and even peeled off a bit. One of the times that I used it, &amp;#34;grew&amp;#34; when it got wet like normal, but then kid of broke off and stuck to the razor blades. It made the razor a little bit difficult to use, and I had to spend some time cleaning the blades to get a good shave. Other than this happening a few times, it has been great the rest of the time, and even though it now seems like most of the strip is gone (time to change the blade, lol), I&#x27;m still getting a good smooth shave. I would just like it a little bit more if the issue with the strip was fixed.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free from BzzAgent, and I am in love! I loved the vibrating razor I had, and this one has an added bonus; trimmer! This razor really leaves a close, smooth shave. I haven&#x27;t had agitated skin bc of it, and plan to use this as my go-to razor for the summer!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this razor! As a BzzAgent I got to try it free and I have to tell you, I would definitely purchase one. Softess my legs have ever been and so easy to go from legs to bikini area right in the shower! And no razor burn! Not even the &amp;#34;ever so tender&amp;#34; bikini area!!! I was so excited! Just love it!</li>
    <li> Great razor, the moisturizing strips are great to the point that you don&#x27;t need shaving cream. The only thing that I had issue with was that I razor kind of like this before. The previous razor would allow you to hold the button and let go and that would leave the trimmer running even when you weren&#x27;t pushing the button, this one doesn&#x27;t do that. This in no way stops the razor from doing it&#x27;s job and doing it well.</li>
    <li> This is such a great innovative duo. I received this razor through BzzAgent as a free gift. But it is such an awesome razor all you need is this one razor to do everything you need to get done. I love that since I already had some schick refills that they fit right on to this razor, no need to have to buy different refill heads for this. I have always loved Schick so this just has stepped up the razor game for me and I&#x27;m so happy about it. Way to go Schick!!</li>
    <li> I received my TrimStyle free through BzzAgent.com and boy oh boy am I thankful! This is the best invention EVER for all your grooming needs! It&#x27;s so awesome that my husband tried to steal it from me! If you haven&#x27;t tried it you are missing out! Silky smooth legs for days and no irritated bikini line! I&#x27;m in love and just in time for summer!</li>
    <li> I got to try out the hydro silk trim style thanks to a site called bzzagent.com. Let me tell you I abolutely love this product! I have never gotten such a close smooth shave. It has great features. It gives you a razor plus a trimmer with adjustable length settings. I never had my own personal adorable trimmer and now they are both together in one peice! With this product you don&#x27;t have to be scared to rock your shorty shorts or most importantly that awesome bikini you&#x27;ve been waiting to pull out!</li>
    <li> I love this razor it makes a smooth shave and is very comfortable to use. I don&#x27;t get any nicks when using this razor. The trimmer was not so great for me. I feel like it takes so long to get a complete shave that it&#x27;s actually easier to just use the razor end on your bikini area. When I first used the trimmer it pulled a little but the more I try it and the more use to it I get the better it works.</li>
    <li> I am a bit on the fence about this razor. I received this razor through a Bzz Agent Campaign and I was really excited about the convenience of a razor and trimmer in one. I thought it would save time and energy and if nothing else I could use it to do a quick touch up between trims. I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I LOVED the razor part and I am now a customer for life. I have used Schick Silk Effects for as long as I can remember and I have always been happy but that was because I had never tried anything really different. This razor gives a much closer and smoother shave and the price it in the same general area so it is everything that I am looking for in a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the disappointment. I was hoping the trimmer would do a wonderful job and make my shower routine much faster. What I found was the that razor was definitely not made for plus size women. I would have to me a contortionist to reach the places I needed to reach without slicing up my hands at the same time. No matter how I twisted and turned I could not get the trimmer to do anything but pull out the hair. I finally gave up and reached for my regular trimmer. Curious to see if it was just me or the trimmer, I decided to trim the baby fine hairs on my arm. I will say that after a few passes the fuzz on my arm was reduced to stubble-fuzz. So that is something at least.</li>
    <li> I got the opportunity to try the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor free through BzzAgent. I have been using the Schick Hydro Silk razor as my primary razor before this campaign, so I had high expectations for the TrimStyle. I was not disappointed. I gave it four stars because the power button was hard to use the first time (every time I took my finger off the power button it would turn off), but after I finally got it working, it has worked fine each time since. I can count on this razor for a smooth shave without shaving cream, and I love the convenience of having the bikini trimmer on the other side. I would recommend this product to a friend without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I received a sample to test from BzzAgent. Let me say I&#x27;m in love with it and won&#x27;t go back to a ordinary Razor&lt;br /&gt;Nothing like the hydro silk trim style to get you ready for summer. It&#x27;s my #1 go to razor now. It leaves your legs all silky smooth. Also is a 2 in one with bikini trimmer. For all you ladies that like going to the beach. I recommend you use it before pool time and beach. It&#x27;s battery operated comes with everything you need and its water proof. Try it! I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t go back to a regular old razor after using this one. Ready, Shave, Shine! Come on ladies lets see those legs!</li>
    <li> I got the Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® in my BzzKit from BzzAgent.  Great razor in LOVE with those 5 blades that shave my legs in a single swipe. And that moisture strip?! Amazing. I tried dry shaving for the first time with this product and it worked beautifully. The trimmer is not as special in my eyes. Hardly work for me and takes too long to get anything done.  The cute little kickstand is a great idea that needs to be on all razors. Don&#x27;t leave it in the shower I found even in the opposite end that the moisture bar would get over moisturized and get gummy.</li>
    <li> Before receiving this free sample from BzzAgent, of the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle, I was currently using the regular Schick Hydro Silk and LOVED it!! I do feel that Schick makes the best razors on the market! They provide the closest and softest results! When comparing the two razors, I feel the actual razor is the same and provides excellent results! It&#x27;s very moisturizing and provides a close smooth shave. The TrimStyle grooming razor didn&#x27;t do much for me because the hydro takes care of all my areas that I need shaved. However I love the width of the TrimStyle handle and feel that&#x27;s an easier grip to shave with. The regular hydro razor causes my hand to cramp when shaving for a long time, but the bigger handle helped me and is a much better improvement! I do feel the button for the trimstyle part is in an awkward position and can easily be turned on by accident.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have mixed feelings with this product. I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase again for the actual TrimStyle part. I&#x27;d almost like them as two separate razors, but maybe in the same packaging.  But I love the width of the handle and the hydro razor so that is worth it to me.</li>
    <li> I was offered to try this through BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve always been a Schick fan so I jumped at the opportunity. This is an amazing addition to any grooming routine. Mows leg hair like a boss and leaves them silky smooth! Having the trimmer conveniently located on the opposite end means no extra &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in the shower. The trimmer does not pull like most other brands.</li>
    <li> I love my new Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle Razor and bikini trimmer. the first thing i love is i can do everything i need to do for my lady areas with one razor and do not have to use two or three i am so happy i fot to try this promotional offer for free. the close shave when you use this with skintamate shave gel is so close and smooth and leaves you feeling so silky. i recomend all woman try this out</li>
    <li> love this so much...i hate waxing so this is pefect for me..i was scared of the trmmer but it didnt snag on hair which i was scared of.the adjustable clipper is easy to adjust just be careful you dont break it..fyi i got this as a sample to test out..</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try out this razor free from BzzAgent and overall it&#x27;s a pretty fabulous razor. I am very very picky about my razors and tend to buy men&#x27;s razors because they give me a better shave. This razor hasn&#x27;t completely changed my mind however for a ladies razor it&#x27;s pretty great. There is so much lotion/serum on it that I don&#x27;t even need to use shaving cream or soap to shave my legs and it makes my legs so smooth afterwards. However the real star of this razor is the bikini trimmer. I am so impressed that I am able to use a trimmer like this in the shower and it works very well (too well even I cut off way more than I was planning too on accident!) It makes it easy to make your lady parts pretty. My only complaint is that the trimmer is a little bit sharper than I would like to use on such a sensitive area. It&#x27;s not sharp enough to cut you or anything but I can&#x27;t trim for long periods of time without it stinging a bit. However I don&#x27;t need to trim very long since the trimmer works as well as it does. I would recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I tested this Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle Razor and Bikini Trimmer for free. This is the BEST bikini trimmer that I have ever used! I love how the trimmer isn&#x27;t ridiculously loud when running and that when using the trimmer/razor, it doesn&#x27;t cut you easily. The razor end works well and pivots nicely, but should have a cover to protect it/you when not in use. It came with a battery, which was easy to insert by just twisting it in the middle. I didn&#x27;t like that the button to turn the trimmer on/off was hard to press though. I also wish that it was a little bit longer since each end is used for a different purpose.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t move with curves. Needless to say, knees and ankles get nicked.</li>
    <li> Received this product as part of a promotion from the brand through BZZAGENT, and I like it so far left my skin smooth and I like the 2 in 1 feature will recommend to others!</li>
    <li> First I would like to start by saying that I did receive this product for free to try through BzzAgent, however that doesn&#x27;t make my review any less true. This razor really deserves every star. I honestly cannot say enough about this razor!! I was really just expecting to have it be like any other razor I have tried, but it totally wasn&#x27;t! All I have to say are good things about it. I tried to be picky and find something that I didn&#x27;t like, and I couldn&#x27;t. So here are my list of Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* The moisture strip stays way longer than razors I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;* The shave lasts longer than other razors.&lt;br /&gt;* The razor is wide enough that I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m shaving forever, but still small enough that I can get it around my bikini line just fine.&lt;br /&gt;* I love the trimming end and the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof&lt;br /&gt;* The little knob on the bottom side helps keep the blades from touching the shelf in your shower so the blades don&#x27;t get rusty&lt;br /&gt;* Its easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;* Its just awesome overall!!</li>
    <li> To start, since I received this razor for testing purposes from BzzAgent. I may have gotten this product for free, but my opinion is 100% honest. My first impression was, this could be very handy to have 2 razors in one, especially because retail estate in the shower is slim.  The packaging was pretty and didn&#x27;t take much effort to open...I didn&#x27;t lose any fingers or sustain any nasty paper cuts!  I used the regular razor part first.  I felt the shave I got was better than with my previous razor.  I noticed some goo/slime that came off the razor, but it washed off easily.  I was able to shave my knees without cutting myself which is usually the case.  Sadly I did notice some of the moisture beads has come off after the first use.  Even more fell off after using it again, so I wonder how good of a shave I wil have once those all fall off.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is a nice feature and I was impressed with how easy it is to use.  Be advised, even with the guard on, on the lowest setting, you can &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; off the hair.  It may take a little while to get the settings figured out, but it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I was able to try this razor.  Thanks BzzAgent and Schick for the opportunity!</li>
    <li> #gotitfree from buzz agent. What a great product! They Schick Hyrdl Silk TrimStyle razor works perfectly. It glides smoothly and evenly for a close shave. The Trimmer was so easy to use, pop in the battery choose your setting and you&#x27;re ready to go. The trimmer gave me no issues what so ever. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Covers more area to shave. Leaves skin silky smooth. I love it. The trimmer is bonus for sure and easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> I thought this was good product when I first received it and it was. But after three weeks of use it just stopped working. I thought it might be the batteries but nope. Even with new batteries it doesn&#x27;t turn on.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this razor.</li>
    <li> Best razor / bikini trimers I have ever used!  Is smooth &amp; easy to use . No pain</li>
    <li> The hydro silk is great for my sensitive skin. No razor burns or itchiness afterwards.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer.  Better than any $20+ trimmer I have used.  Good shipping.</li>
    <li> I absolutely recommend this product. I received this as a promotional product for BzzAgent. It&#x27;s a razor big whoop is what I thought, I&#x27;ve had plenty of razors before but this happens to be my first all in one trimmer! This made trimmer made was awesome cut so much time &amp; made for fewer strokes of the razor. It gave a close shave and left my skin smooth&amp; without razor burn even on my armpits. Bikini, legs arms I love it! Plus it&#x27;s waterproof &amp; easy to clean by just easily untwisting parts. Definitely glad I took this product to review it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> I love this item I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this razor! Received this as a sample from BzzAgent and did not know I would like it so much! The hydrating factor is no lie, I have pretty dry skin and the razor did a really great job of making my skin feel smooth and moisturized. The trimmer was.... a little bit too complicated for me at first but once i got the hang of it, I ended up kind of liking it. It didn&#x27;t give me as close of a cut as I would have liked but it still worked well, nonetheless. I would, for sure, recommend it!</li>
    <li> Buzzagent gave me the opportunity to try this product free of charge, but this review / my opinion is all my own!  I can&#x27;t even remember what it was like before this razor came into my life! I have always had issues with getting cuts every time I shaved. With this razor I get the result I want ( very close shave) with out the pain ( or band-aids ). I have had this razor for about a month now, and it continues to give me the same results every time. One thing that has changed is that I have started to appreciate to trimmer a lot more. I trim my bikini area before using the actual razor, and it has dramatically reduced the razor burn/ ingrown hair problem I had.</li>
    <li> It is a cool device,  2 in 1.  It works with a AAA battery, but it still manages to be light and sleek and easy to maneuver.  No need to have two shaving tools anymore!  The trimmer is gentle, efficient, works in the shower, and does not irritate skin.  The razor is the same quality as the other Schick razors, which is always good, and once it get dull, it is interchangeable for a refill. Overall, great product, easy to use and would recommend.</li>
    <li> I never would have bought this until I got it free to try from bzzagent.com.&lt;br /&gt;I personally loved this product for the trimer alone. I have never used a trimmer like this before, just razors and ALWAYS had either razor burn or nicked myself. NONE of this so far. I think the razor is great to clean up the parts I want no hair in my bikini zone, and it works well on my legs. I do have another Schick razor that works better on my legs so this is now just my bikini razor. The blade guard on the trimmer is great and really allows for all sorts of levels so you can control what you do and don&#x27;t remove. I also love that it is quiet and can be used wet or dry. I highly recommend this product and have recommended this to some of my friends and my sister.</li>
    <li> Perfect razor to keep in your shower!  I had trouble finding one of these locally so I found this on Amazon and gave it a shot.  I will definitely order this again when it is time for a new one. Both razor ends work like a charm!</li>
    <li> excellant item.  Works great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works great . I gave it 1star because I spent $25.00 on it here on Amazon then found the same razor at Walmart for $10.00.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for years now and it&#x27;s been my favorite! I tried many other ones, but I always seem to come back to this one. Hands down, the BEST one I have ever used in my life… So far ;)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a razor. The extra feature is really not too convenient.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Great invention and subtle look.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised by this. You can&#x27;t beat the price, and it does its Job! No more painful razorburn.</li>
    <li> The shaver part doesn&#x27;t work.  It&#x27;s too flimsy for me.</li>
    <li> I really loved the razor side it gave a very close shave and moisturized really nice. The trimmer side however was very weak even without the guard on it did not give a close shave or trim and I feel like it&#x27;s not worth the money if I only liked the razor being I can buy a shick razor alone for a lot cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this razor free for review  as a bzzagent.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this razor!! It was so helpful that it had both a razor and a trimmer (with adjustable guide)! I would definitely recommend buying this!</li>
    <li> Overall, great razor.  Has wonderful features and really gives a close shave. #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I received this as a free trial from a bzz-agent campaign, and I am so very impressed with this razor. When shaving, I couldn&#x27;t even feel the blade, yet the shave was so close and made my skin feel so smooth! Coming from someone who previously used disposable razors, I am totally in love with this razor. I also love that this is a 2 in 1- the trimmer is a huge plus and can be used just about anywhere on your body where you have unwanted hair. The packaging was feminine and enticing, and I like that the razor comes with the energizer battery, so you don&#x27;t have to root through your house searching for the right size battery. Very highly recommended, I am definitely a fan!</li>
    <li> The dual end razor is truly the best of both worlds. The shave it provides is very smooth. The battery life seems to be great. It feels great in the hand and is not bulky at all.</li>
    <li> I love this razor my favorite so far leaves my legs feeling smooth and soft I also love the trimmer the best part is its water proof so no need to worry about getting it wet love it .</li>
    <li> I liked the idea of trying out a new and unique razor. I loved the razor side, got a nice close shave with a nourishing touch, which is good because I have sensitive skin. The electric part is nice because you can do it in the shower or dry, which is really good when needing a quick touch up before going to the pool. I just wish the electric shaver was a little more powerful, I found myself needing to go over parts multiple times before it got all of the hairs. Overall a great product, just needs some minor adjustments.</li>
    <li> I received this razor to try for free from Bzzagent, and I am so glad that I did! I absolutely love this all in one razor and waterproof bikini trimmer that can be set to 4 different trimming settings! Not to mention, the color is beautiful, and it leaves your skin feeling smooth for hours after shaving, especially when paired with Skintimate shaving gel! Thanks Bzzagent for allowing me to try this razor free of charge, and for sending coupons for discounted shaving gel, $4 off of a refill pack, and $4 off of a razor for my friends! I can&#x27;t wait to tell them about this razor!</li>
    <li> Shaves close to the skin. Love the color of my I got from buzz agent ! The buzzer is a handy dandy tool that works so well and can adjust to different lengths !</li>
    <li> The Schick hydro silk TrimStyle razor has been a great experience. The razor blade is very smooth on the skin without worrying about cutting yourselve. All you need to do is put a little shaving cream and after your skin feels so smooth. Not only that but the razor comes with two sides. One side is a razor to shave your legs and armpits. The other side is a trimmer for your bikini area. Not only that but the razor comes with a battery so you don&#x27;t need to worry about going to the store again. I will definitely pick up more blades for this razor. Schick has exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this Product..and let me tell you, it works great! My legs are silky smooth!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy this in the future!</li>
    <li> I got this razor Free from BzzAgent. I am super happy that I chose this campaign. The razor was great, the shave was close and the moisture strip did not break my skin out. I have super sensitive skin and most moisturizers on razors break me out.&lt;br /&gt;Although I do not typically look for a trimmer on my razors this was a great added bonus. It came in the mail a few days ago and I was able to use it for an event. It saved me from having to go to the store and I got a great close shave.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I have not bought end a re usable razor in years. This razor put the faith back in me that re usable razors are worth it!</li>
    <li> I tried this for free with Bzzagent and I am surprised it turned my nicks and cuts from old shavers to shame. The serum that activates when wet made shaving so easy it was so silky smooth. The softest shaver I have ever used it curves with ease and its easy to hold with the grip on the handle.</li>
    <li> I received this as a free sample as part of a promotion for the brand, and I love it! This razor leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft, refreshed and rejuvenated, and clean! I would recommend this product for everyone!</li>
    <li> I recieved the Schick hydro silk trimstyle razor through a promotion on bzzagent. I really loved it. One of the sleekest and effortless razor I&#x27;ve ever used. My legs have never been smoother. The only negative thing I would say is I didn&#x27;t like the bikini trimmer much but I think it just depends on how you groom.  I would definitely still make a purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a Bzz Agent campaign, and was very excited about it. I have sensitive skin, especially around my bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty disappointed with this razor. First of all, the trimmer did not do a good job, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but it didn&#x27;t come close to the close shave I would need to be comfortable in a swimsuit, so it&#x27;s not something that I would use. Secondly, the razor itself was pretty bad. I got a decent shave, but it left my legs so red and irritated, I can&#x27;t even wear shorts because the razor burn is so bad.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from bzzagent and was really looking forward to it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The razor itself is great. Not a single knick! The trimmer, though, even on the closest setting trimmed barely anything. I&#x27;ll continue to simply shave my bikini area.</li>
    <li> So excited to receive this free from BzzAgent. Overall, I really liked the razor. The 5 blades gave me an amazingly close shave with no cuts! I was really happy that this razor contained hypoallergenic moisture serum because I have some allergies and sensitivities to certain cosmetics and beauty products. While the serum did not irritate my skin, I noticed that while shaving, the serum started accumulating and became a glob that stuck to the blades. I had to keep rinsing the blades off in order to keep a close shave but otherwise it worked just fine. As I continued to use the razor, this problem began to subside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the trimmer, I already used a battery powered bikini trimmer and was eager to compare the two. It took me a little while to figure out how to hold the trimmer and angle it right. I felt like the trimmer could be a little better but it works. Also, the first time I turned on the trimmer I was disappointed to see that you had to hold the button down in order to make it work but on my second use, I pressed the button once and it stayed on. This is a minor problem but I definitely think this should be fixed because when I was holding the button down I would occasionally get hair caught when the trimmer would cut off suddenly. This was not a pleasant experience. But when I figured out how to get it to stay on properly, it worked perfectly. Overall, this is a great razor and a must-have for all those busy ladies out there!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have never had a more smooth feeling when it comes to my leg than I do with this product. Not to mention I don&#x27;t have to rush to shave my legs, or bikini area, the next day like I have to with most razors. The trimmer is amazing. Makes it so much easier than using a typical razor, and is so much less painful than a bikini wax. This product is a must buy ladies!</li>
    <li> This razor and trimmer is amazing! I love that it have hydrating strips around the razor for my legs and more sensitive areas. I used to get razor burn all the time but since i&#x27;ve used this razor I don&#x27;t anymore! The trimmer attachment is a life saver! I used the trimmer on the #2 setting for my bikini line and it&#x27;s just perfect for my needs. No more paying $70+ for a bikini wax! I&#x27;ll never go back to a regular old razor again! I highly recommend to anyone looking for an affordable high quality alternative to spa bikini waxes!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product!  I was a skeptic about the results before using the razor because of the design.  The razor neck is flat instead of arched and elevated like some other razors.  However, I used Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle on my bikini area and its smooth straight design left me feeling smooth.  The razor was so delicate that I did not feel like I was shaving.  It left me with a very close and smooth shave.  It is an added bonus that the razor is double sided and battery operated on the opposite end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#GotItFree</li>
    <li> I received this from Bzzagent and I love it! it did not irritate or cut my skin. The best part is that its reusable and can be use without shaving cream!</li>
    <li> I  recieved the schick hydrosilk razor  and trimmer free to try from bzzagent.com and it is amazing.  I usually epilate and wax and it reaulted in legs and bikini area being almost as smooth with none of the irritation.  I have extremely sensitive skin and had absolutely no itching bumps or cuts as a result.  You could barely even feel the blades gliding over your skin.  This is a great razor.  I&#x27;ve tried many different hair removal texhniques and shaving usually leaves me with itxhy irritated legs.  I  tried the trimmer and it really  wasn&#x27;t for me i just prefer a Brazilian over trimming but im sure it would be great for others</li>
    <li> I really like this!! I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, but if you need the trimming end, then get it! I like the regular razor end for my legs especially!! SOO silky!! I recommend it! I got this as a free promotion from the brand and I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I loved the pretty packaging and color! I was pleased with the initial results but after a week my blades dulled and the gel completely went aay around my blade area. Now I get razor burn and it is a waste. I wish this product would have lasted.</li>
    <li> i love this razor. i love that my skin is left feeling smooth and moisturized its smooth close shave is exactly what i have always been looking for</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing!! I love the moisturizing serum in the actual razor portion. It makes my legs feel unbelievably smooth. It has a nice close shave which keeps my legs hair free for days. It also helps prevent cuts that I get with normal razors. The bikini trimmer is nice but I was unable to use it with the comb and removing it seemed a little unsafe. Over all I love it and I&#x27;m excited to continue using it. I&#x27;m very thankful for the coupons as the blades are a tad expensive.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Schick products and the Schick Hydro TrimStyle and Bikini Trimmer is yet another reason. I already own the Schick Hydro Silk razor and the Schick Quatro TrimStyle, which is very similar to this product. I love that theses are reusable and they trimmer works wonderfully! I recommend this product to all women who like trimming their bikini area and the convenience of having a razor for your legs. I got my Schick Hydro free from BzzAgent. #GOTITFREE</li>
    <li> Smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I received this as a sample from bzz agent and was so excited to use it. In the type of person that cis herself every time she shaves. With this razor, no nicks! I was beyond thrilled with its performance overall.</li>
    <li> Got this from bzzagent to try out. Love the design of this razor. gices a close shave with no nicks or cuts. Also, love the trimmer on the other end, very convient</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this razor. I have always loved the Schick Hydro, but the added bikini razor is amazing! I can get everything cleaned up and trimmed in one easy session! I highly recommend this razor, especially if you have sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Was part of the Bzzz Agent Campaign and received the product for free. All opinions and ideas are my own.*</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor!  I tried it for the first time recently, I can honestly say I will never go back to any other razor again.  This razor provides a VERY close shave,  closer then any razor I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It looks and feels very smooth.  Love that the buzzer side works even through the water. Perfect razor I suggest EVRRY girl own this razor!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get to use the trimmer because I don&#x27;t have hair long enough to use it for.  But I&#x27;m impressed with the razor.  It moisturized the skin and made the shaving job really easy! I received this for free as a promotional sample.  Its a little bulky but you get adjusted to it easily.  Very nice and simple packaging.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this razor. The lubricating strip on the razor left my legs feeling silky smooth and did not irritate my sensitive skin, particularly my bikini area which is prone to bumps. The only disappointment I had with this razor was that lubricating strip will not last as long as the life of the razor blade. By the third time using it, I began to notice the effectiveness of the strip to go down. However, the electric bikini razor makes the product a worthwhile buy just by itself. You can set the trimmer to 3 different lengths or use it without the guard. It is the perfect size for your bikini and works wonderfully. It is also obviously waterproof and can be used in the shower, but I got the best results while trimming while dry. I received this razor/bikini trimmer by participating as a Bzz Agent, but I can see myself purchasing the refills for it in the near future.</li>
    <li> This product is simply AMAZING and love the appearance and how easily controllable it is! Thank you for making such a wonderful product.#GotItFree #BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this razor!!! Nice, clean, smooth shave and the moisture bar leaves you feeling like you just put lotion on! And the bikini trimmer is awesome! The comb on it lets you set the length. And like other razors doesn&#x27;t miss a thing! And doesn&#x27;t leave you with pesky ingrown hairs! And ladies with problem facial hair or want an eyebrow trimmer...this is for you too!! Perfect eyebrows using the bikini trimmer!AAnd hair from your lip or chin is removed with it as well! Awesome productand the only rrazor I&#x27;ll ever need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: Got it free</li>
    <li> After receiving a free Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® razor, I was very excited to try it. After a long winter, I was definitely in need of an improved leg and bikini care routine. I can say without a doubt this is the best razor I have ever used. The bikini trimmer was a unique feature that made a great first step in my bikini care routine. The razor itself produced a wonderfully close, smooth, and moisturizing shave. Unlike other moisturizing razors I&#x27;ve tried, the razor was surrounded by solid plastic that did not fall apart after a few uses. I will definitely recommend this to my friends. The only downside I can think of is that the battery in the bikini trimmer makes it a bit bulkier than other razors. Not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Just tried out this product and I have to say that it was just mediocre.  I am a 21 year old female and I have never tried a bikini trimmer before.  I typically just use a regular razor.  I tried using the bikini trimmer several times on the highest trim setting (the comb removed) and it could not get any closer than my regular razor does.  I have not yet tried it after not shaving for a while, but I typically like to stay well groomed down there, which is why I don&#x27;t wax.  I gave this 4 out of 5 stars since the other side with the razor is really nice, even though I don&#x27;t think I will use the trimmer.  I will probably continue to use their other lines of razors since those are cheaper.  The razor gives a nice smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like some razors can.  I have fairly easy to shave hair though (blonde, not coarse)  so take that into consideration.</li>
    <li> I received the TrimStyle for free through BzzAgent. I love it. There are extra blades in the razor itself, making for a very close shave. It has a good moisturizing strip above the blades. It is a major convenience to have the trimmer on the other end. I would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with a &amp;#34;2-in-1&amp;#34; razor/trimer and it did not disappoint!  I signed up to try the product through BzzAgent - and I was so happy with the product I&#x27;ll definitely keep using/replacing the blades.  Packaging was easy to open &amp; came with a battery included! Bonus! My only complaint is that the instructions were printed on the inside of the cardboard packaging which I accidentally ripped while opening the product.  Also the instructions focus more on cleaning/storing your razor/trimer than how to use it.  As someone who has never used a trimer it was intimidating as I winged it, but it was easy enough.  I just used the trimming head to avoid any nicks/cuts.  However it is removable for an even closer shave.</li>
    <li> Shaving and trimming has always been something I cared about but could never quite find the right product/tool to help me do it in a way that was easy and quick. After using  an assortment of different razors and trimmers  I was given the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor by BzzAgent. It really felt like a miracle. The razor was effective and soothing, leaving no red bumps behind. The trimmer was super easy to use and took only seconds to have me ready for the great outdoors. AND I could use the trimmer while waiting for my roommate to get out of the shower because it was so neat and tidy. This is a great product and I would highly recommend it for those looking for a new and improved way to take care of legs and the bikini area.</li>
    <li> I am a member of the free website BzzAgent.com, and I was recently selected to try out they occasionally send me new products to try out. I was lucky enough to get to try the new Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle (for free of course!). I am not normally one to try out the “fancy” razors….I tend to believe that all razors are created equal. Boy was I wrong! This razor is AMAZING! On one side of the handle is the razor. It has five blades, surrounded by a skin guard that has hypoallergenic moisturizing serum in it. This is great for me because I have SUPER sensitive skin. This i probably the first time I have shaved my legs where there was no irritation AT ALL!! On the other side of the handle is an electric bikini trimmer with a detachable guard that adjusts to four different lengths. Great news! It’s WATERPROOF!! This makes it super easy to shave and trim all at once! It has a comfortable handle that doesn’t fell like it is going to break in my hand, it is easy to use, and it leaves your legs feeling flawless! I would definitely recommend the ladies give this a try ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m half impressed. The trimmers do a great job and as expected. The razor does a great job on my legs however it gave my under arms razor burn and lots of nicks and cuts in the bikini area. I do not recommend storing the razor standing up on the razor head either because the moisture strip will melt away.</li>
    <li> I loved this Razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It grooms the bikini area so well. The only razor not to give me in grown hair! im definitely sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to all. its the best razor i have used, and ive used quite a few of them</li>
    <li> I just got the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle from BzzAgent for free to try and review. I used to have the Schick Quattro trimmer/razor for about 4 years and liked it, however I rarely used the trimmer. With this product I still probably won&#x27;t use the trimmer often as I like to be &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; down there, so the razor is better for me. The razor gave me a very close, smooth shave that lasted longer than any shave with the Quattro had. I did try out the trimmer and it worked really well, but hair length will still be around 1/8&amp;#34; after trimming, which is still too long for my tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tossed my Quattro and am very happy to have a lovely new favorite razor :) #GotItFree</li>
    <li> At first I was surprised by the size, I don&#x27;t know why I thought it would&#x27;ve been smaller. Next I used the razor to shave my legs and I have to tell you, I didn&#x27;t think it was going to beat my current razor, but surprisingly enough it was just as good! The shave was close and the head swiveled and adjusted to the nooks and crannies of my body and as I&#x27;m writing this hours later, my legs are unbelievably soft! I can&#x27;t stop rubbing them! Next I used the trimmer, to &#x27;shape up&#x27; and once I got the hang of it, it worked pretty well. My only concern was that there&#x27;s no guideline or illustration that let&#x27;s me know how much gets trimmed at each level, or rather how much gets chopped off. I would&#x27;ve liked to know that setting one is buzz cut, setting two leaves a light dusting, setting three just takes a little off the top, etc.... Overall though, once I get the hang of the TrimStyle, I feel it&#x27;s going to be my best friend.Received a free product</li>
    <li> This product has everything a women could ask for or need for shaving special areas. The handle has the right amount of grip to keep you from losing the razor in the shower. Waterproof trimmer gets up close and works in curves and every where you need. With the hydrating strip in the razor helps keep you moisturize and smooth. The five curving sensing blades helps you from cutting your self and getting you a close shave. The water proof trimmer can be used in the shower or out of shower. In a hurry need a quick shave for your legs just grab trimmer and get it done. I received this free from bzz agent tired it right away and fell in love with it.</li>
    <li> I got this product as part of a promotion to review from the brand and to be honest I really like it. It leaves my legs feeling so soft and smooth and it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold and use. I like how the bikini side is smaller so it can get into nooks and cranies. However, I don&#x27;t think the battery or the vibration is really necessary to get a good shave.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I received it from BzzAgent and absolutely love it! My legs have never felt smoother! I typically lotion after shave and this time I did not! The feature of shaving under water is great as I like to shave in bath tub!</li>
    <li> So, I tried out the new Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor that I received to try from BzzAgent this morning. I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like it, because I usually don&#x27;t have much success with razors other than my Schick Quattro for my legs and Schick Intuition for my bikini line and armpits. I was surprised with this razor (though given it&#x27;s a Schick, I probably shouldn&#x27;t have been). First, I like that the bikini trimmer is attached and is waterproof. It&#x27;s like a one-stop shop for shaving, it&#x27;s convenient to get it all done while in the shower at one time. The trimmer made it a lot easier to trim the &amp;#34;forest&amp;#34; so to speak, than using a regular razor. I was able to adjust the trimmer to the length I wanted, and you just can&#x27;t do that with a regular razor. The razor itself gave me an unbelievably close shave. Even now, 18 hours later, I have no visible stubble, and my legs are still soft and smooth. I usually don&#x27;t use a regular razor on my underarms because it can irritate and burn a little, but I didn&#x27;t have that happen with this razor. Even my armpits still feel nice and smooth. I also used the razor on my bikini line in places that I prefer a closer shave. Usually this task is left to my Schick Intuition razor because I have never experience irritation, razor burn, or rash in this sensitive area using the Silk Effects razor. Again, I got an incredibly smooth shave and so far, I have not experienced any of the problems that I have had with other razors in that area. Now, there are some cons with this razor (hence the 4 star review and not 5 star). The handle is something to get used to on my legs because it is larger than my Quattro razor. I kept pushing the button for the trimmer and turning it on. I did not have a problem in the bikini area because the Silk Effects touts a larger handle. I do have to make sure I use care when shaving my legs, because I did cut the back of my ankle, and weirdly enough, the razor took a small piece of skin off of my shin. I had a small scab there, but it took more skin off than just the scab. The area is still a little tender, and I had to put a Band-Aid on it after I showered because it was bleeding. This won&#x27;t deter me from using the razor though. It was user error on my part and not the fault of the razor itself.ad a small scab there, but it took more skin off than just the scab. The area is still a little tender, and I had to put a Band-Aid on it after I showered because it was bleeding. This won&#x27;t deter me from using the razor though. It was user error on my part and not the fault of the razor itself.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to receive this trimmer and even happier after I got a chance to use it. I love the way it fits and feels in my hand. The handle is great for soapy hands as it&#x27;s not slick and awkward.&lt;br /&gt;My legs and bikini line feel great after using this trimmer and I wasn&#x27;t in the shower near as long since I had the only tool I needed in my hand!!&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it came with a real battery instead of a cheap one!!</li>
    <li> I got this free in the mail from BzzAgent. At first I was not really excited about getting this razor. I&#x27;ve only found one razor that I sort of like, so I figured I wouldn&#x27;t like this one either. I was pleasantly surprised after I used this for the first time last week. I have always gotten razor burn after shaving. Here I am a week after shaving with Hydro Silk and zero sign of razor burn! It&#x27;s a miracle! I will be using this razor from now on. It leaves your skin feeling so smooth, and no razor burn is just the icing on the cake!</li>
    <li> I just received my Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini Trimmer in the mail for free thanks to BzzAgent. I am so happy with this razor! It is by far my favorite razor out there right now. It provides such a close shave and the head pivots nicely over each curve. The trimmer end is amazing as well. I love how no hair gets snagged or caught when using it. It provides a nice trim with and without the guard. I am very pleased with this product and I am so happy I was able to give it a try. it will be my new one and only razor/trimmer I will ever need!</li>
    <li> *I received my Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Trimmer for free through BzzAgent!!*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow. After a few less than pleasant experiences with Hydro Silk razors in the past, I was nervous about trying this one. I figured since I get to try it free as a BzzAgent, I had nothing to lose! This razor/trimmer was a very pleasant surprise! I&#x27;m going to break down my review into different categories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: 3.5/5 stars The box is definitely an eye-catcher with its combination of shiny silver, purple, and light blue, but it&#x27;s not so bulky as to make you feel like you&#x27;re paying mostly for that. It was mostly easy to open, (the battery was pretty wedged in there), but I REALLY did not like that they printed the instructions on the inside back of the box. That was super inconvenient! It was hard to see, hard to read, and if you don&#x27;t open the package carefully, you&#x27;ll probably rip it off! Not very well thought-out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor: 4/5 stars They didn&#x27;t cut any corners when designing the razor end! With 5 blades plus aloe strips, it is sure to give you a close shave without sacrificing moisture. It maneuvered very well, even over more sensitive areas like the front and back of my knees. I was also thrilled they included a little point for the razor to rest on without leaving it sitting in shower water. Very smart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer: 4/5 stars Again, very well designed. There are three levels to choose from, but really they don&#x27;t vary that much. I preferred the longer trim but it does go shorter if you wish. All the pieces come off/lift up for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So once again I will say I was very pleasantly surprised with this razor/trimmer combo. It has a nice quality weight, takes only one common battery, and it&#x27;s very easy to assemble. The razor provides a great, moisturizing shave, and the trimmer gives you three different options so you can finish feeling and looking your best! I will definitely be purchasing this in the future.</li>
    <li> The TrimStyle earns five out of five stars from me for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- five blades! The shave is incredibly close&lt;br /&gt;- moisturizing strip is a nice bonus&lt;br /&gt;- trimmer and therefore the entire razor is waterproof!&lt;br /&gt;- you don&#x27;t have to hold the on button for it to stay on&lt;br /&gt;- very ergonomic&lt;br /&gt; **I received this razor from BzzAgent and did not buy it, however my review is my own, honest opinion</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used hands  down!! Super silky glide and no worrying about cuts or knicks. Oh and ZERO razor bumps afterward! Which was a first for me! I also love the trimmer! Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I received my 2-in1 razor/bikini trimmer in the mail about a week ago and I am in love! I have never had an easier time with a similar product.</li>
    <li> Love love love love is so amazin smooth first of all is waterproof trimmer works great while you shower and make no mess to clean up after. When you shave your legs you bearly feel anything it makes you wonder is it working?? Well after you shower and dry yourself your legs feel so smooth nice shave no bumps which is a plus. I&#x27;m in love with this razor trimmer duo. Would recommend to anyone even guys :).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Schick Trimstyle for about 3 weeks now after getting a free sample from Schick, and I have to say that it&#x27;s my new razor of choice. I love that I can take care of all of my grooming needs with one device and no mess. The razor cartridges are particularly nice and I get a great close shave from it. I actually use the Trim function for arm hair and it looks very natural. Overall, it&#x27;s been a great experience.</li>
    <li> I received a free product to review, but the review is 100% honest!&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the razor, I honestly thought it was a bit bulky and would be awkward to shave with, but I was wrong!  The razor handled great!  I had never used a trimmer on my bikini area, so I had a little bit of a learning curve, but the trimmer worked great, and gave a much better result than using a razor.  My 5 year old saw it sitting on the counter while it was drying, asked what it was, and after I told him, he said it looked cool.  What better praise could you get from a 5 year old!</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent and Schick I was given the NEW Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle razor and trimmer to try free. I was really excited when it arrived. It was lighter than i expected and fit in my hand comfortably. Next step, shower to put it to use. It provided a smooth, clean cut to my legs that seems to last a few more days than other razors. For the razor alone I would give it a 5 star but since I found the trimmer to be average I bumped it down to a 4.</li>
    <li> I got to try the Shick Hydro Silk Trim Style for free thanks to Shick and BzzAgent. I have to say this is a really nice razor. The 5 blades give a good close shave and the pivoting head was great for the curves of my leg. The built in trimmer is great for those more intimate places. I really like the blue grip, it definitely made a difference while trying to shave in the shower, no &amp;#34;oops I dropped my razor&amp;#34; here. The only thing I would suggest is a razor blade cover/guard. I was nervous that I would cut myself with the razor blades while using the trimmer. Overall all the Shick Hydro Silk Trim Style is a great product and I would definitely suggest it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product! The razor side is amazing! I myself don&#x27;t have much use of rate trimmer side because there is nothing I need to trim. But i do think it is awesome how it has different levels.  This product works great and leaves my legs feeling so soft!</li>
    <li> I got a Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle®  from Buzz Agent for free &amp; I love it! I have used many different styles and brands over the years but this is by far the best one I have ever used! I will not use another brand for my bikini area again! I gives me the closest and cleanest shave I have had! I had to spend half the time I usually do in the bathroom too! I really do love this product and recommend it for anyone!</li>
    <li> Sent this free to try out - super impressed! Works great, blades last a long time. The trimmer end has a cool little blade guide so you can adjust the height. AND I&#x27;ve never cut myself!</li>
    <li> I got this razor through a website that let&#x27;s you test out products for free and this was the best shave I have ever gotten with a razor.. it&#x27;s smooth and get a that close silky shave you are looking for but I&#x27;m a little disappointed in the trimmer though.. I couldn&#x27;t get it the right trim setting that suited me but I mostly like to go bald down there or all natural depending on mood.. overall it&#x27;s a great product..</li>
    <li> I received this as a free sample through BzzAgent, and I must say I was a bit disappointed. I loved the idea and thought it was awesome, but the bulkiness made it a bit uncomfortable to use, and it is not very flexible because of it. The trimmer portion, while it is effective, does not trim as close as i&#x27;d hoped, even after removing the plastic trim guard! I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be hairless by any means, but I did expect a bit closer trim I guess. The razor was effective, and worked fairly well, but the inflexibility due to the bulkiness really did not allow me to get a proper close shave. All in all, would not recommend, but it is certainly a fantastic idea and worth a try nonetheless.</li>
    <li> This razor was given to me free on BzzAgent. I absolutely loved it! Never had something like this before. The hydrating strip is amazing and the waterproof trimmer makes it even better! I recommend you buy this now! Its one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t regret buying this razor. I got this free as a sample and I love it. I&#x27;m switching from Venus. It&#x27;s the closest shave ever. The gel strip lasts the longest of any razor I&#x27;ve tried and the dual head makes it really versatile. I don&#x27;t get razor burn anymore with this razor either. I won&#x27;t use anything else again. #gotitfree #bzzkit</li>
    <li> This razor is a great double duty tool. The trim side easily adjusts to your preferred cut length. And you can quickly switch to the razor end with no problem. It is easy to hold and to use. Great. This product was given to test for free.</li>
    <li> I got this product a few days ago from BzzAgent. It was sent as a free product to try out allowing me to give my honest opinion about the product. First of all, my legs are very sensitive due to having severe eczema. I cant use cheap razors, I cant use very many triple blades, and have a fear of cutting over my soars with the electric razors. Given said that, I would give this product a 100% rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waterproof bikini trimmer can be used in and OUT of the shower! This was a life saver. I was in a private area outdoors and pulled the TrimStyle razor out. Now, I understand why they call it Hydro Silk! The softness and ease of the razor was delightfully un-frightening to my skin. The adjustable comb gave me the options of trim length.The five curve sensing blades use unique skin guards that help reduce irritation while providing ultimate closeness and the water-activated moisturizing serum is dermatologist tested and helps replenish skin’s natural moisture. What bought me over? Being dermatologist tested, hydro silk strokes, 5 blade razor, no irritation, and the over-all look of my smooth legs!</li>
    <li> I got this free to test out for review purposes and WOW! Not only does the razor side leave my legs bare and smooth and moisturized for the next 2 days but it&#x27;s so easy to use and slides along without fear of any nicks or cuts. I love the button for the bikini trimmer to turn it on and off.  It gets a really clean trim in the hard to reach spots of your bikini line. This is a must have for any woman!</li>
    <li> I received this free from BzzAgent to review &amp; share with others. I loved I didn&#x27;t need shaving gel because it has a moisturizing strip that left my fair sensitive skin feeling silky soft. Also the trimmer done wonders and if you press the button exactly on the power button logo it stays on with no hassle of having to keep holding down on it. I also loved that it is a 5 blade razor which worked great for my coarse hair. Took a few times to get used to the handle but it isn&#x27;t too big and is just right in my opinion,only thing though I&#x27;d say it needs a brush for the trimmer so I just used a eyebrow brush to clean the trimmer. At first I was skeptical about submerging into water with it having a batter in it regardless of it saying water proof. But my conclusion is that I love it &amp; will be using &amp; probably save up some money to buy a lazer hair remover or try an epillater but still keep using this one even then. I&#x27;ve also showed my mother &amp; friends and talked to them about it &amp; of course I recommended it,so now some of them bought one because of how well I told them it worked for me even with my sensitive fair skin no nicks or cuts just silky smooth legs.Thank you BzzAgent &amp; Schick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Kayla Vinson</li>
    <li> This razor is fantastic, my legs are now silky smooth and im not afraid to wear shorts during Summer! I am ready to hit the pool now, the trim did a fantastic job on my bikini area. I am all silky smooth!I got to try this product for free, but the thoughts are my own.</li>
    <li> Received this product free from BzzAgent and am loving it so far! The dual capabilities are great, especially the trimmer. I like the trimmer a bit more than the razor end and would probably continue using it after the razor is used up. The razor is decent as well, but I find that it doesn&#x27;t give me as close of a shave as other razors, most likely due to the fact that there are so many blades that are close together that I they tend to get clogged.</li>
    <li> Best Razor on the Market. Now, I have been a loyal customer of the Intuition brand razors because of the convenience of not having to use shaving cream... But one of my biggest issues with Intuition was that my bikini area was infinitely more dificult to shave/trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I have less ingrown hairs, shave less often and I don&#x27;t need to use multiple trimming tools, scissors etc to neaten things up a bit down there if ya know what I mean!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I #gotitfree from BzzAgent.com, but you can believe I&#x27;ll be back to buy another if this one ever breaks on me... or if I wear it out (which is a much more likely situation).</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Trimmer is exactly as described!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisture strip on the razor has lessened the amount of irritation that I get from shaving sensitive areas, and it kept be feeling soft for much longer than any other razor I have used! I feel as if I got a very close shave, which is always a plus. And this is the first time I have ever used a trimmer, but I fell in love already! I got exactly the look that I wanted without irritation. I really like that the whole thing is waterproof so that I can accomplish both tasks in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price for the initial razor and then refills is really not bad, I will definitely be purchasing more.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot think of any complaints about this product and so, I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Item was given to me at no cost for the purpose of testing and reviewing)</li>
    <li> I received this razor from a bzzagent campaign, but my opinion is my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this razor for a month now. I&#x27;m two month postpartum, so the idea of cleaning up my body and getting back to being &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; is something fresh in my life. I found this razor to be a breath of fresh air. The razor portion itself is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m typically a disposable no nonsense razor kind of girl. As a mom of now 2, I don&#x27;t have a lot of time for self care or elaborate shower routines. This razor made me reevaluate my me time. I allowed myself to use this razor and all of its functions and honestly felt amazing after. The razor portion was a close, incredibly smooth shave. The moisturizer was so soothing to my otherwise dry dehydrated post pregnancy skin. The trimmer provided great close grooming and my bikini line was flawless after using it. The price is awesome for this product- I only deducted 1 star because I feel it would be a perfect package if it offered a bonus razor head.</li>
    <li> I have used  another brand for years but now i am switching to this. It trims really well and the shaver is amazing too. The razor leaves legs super smooth and has a really close shave. I have dark leg hair and sometimes other razors don&#x27;t get the job done leaving black dots and razor bumps but this product did not i was amazed. I also should mention that i have eczema which makes my skin really sensitive,but i had no problems while using this razor, it is my new favorite. I am so glad i got to try this for free from bzzagent</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this razor, the trimmer is waterproof and stays on without having to hold a pesky button down, the hydrating strip works really well for leaving no razor burn and works great with sensitive skin. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the strip kind of fades away quick, but if you use shaving cream you still get a really good shave. All of the razors seem a bit intimidating at first but it&#x27;s a really close shave that leaves your skin feeling and looking beautiful!</li>
    <li> I received this for free from the brand as part of a promotion. I was curious to see how it worked, as I&#x27;m an avid user of another popular razor, but I may have been converted. I only used the razor end, I did not use the bikini trimmer. The actual act of shaving was very smooth and it was the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
    <li> I received this through BzzAgent and was super excited to try this! Firstly, the packaging is a lot nicer than most razors! And I really like the colors! :) Typically I buy men&#x27;s razors because I feel like it&#x27;s a closer shave, but the colors are a lot more masculine, so it&#x27;s nice to finally have a razor with cute colors that still delivers a close shave! I especially love the razor because of the moisture serum. I would repurchase this razor just for that! My skin felt so smooth - no redness, no bumps. The trimmer was a bit disappointing. You need to continuously hold the power button down in order for it to work and that&#x27;s a little bothersome.  It&#x27;s not as easy to use as I had imagined, but I will use the shaver side on a regular basis now. Maybe I just need to work and practice with the trimmer more often to get a good shave. It just didn&#x27;t do that much for me. I would definitely recommend this product for the shaving/blade side with the moisture serum though! It&#x27;s seriously amazing and feels so good on your skin! I can&#x27;t imagine even cutting yourself accidentally with this blade. Also, this razor is waterproof so you can shave in the shower : ) So convenient!</li>
    <li> I just tried out my Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® razor today that I got for FREE from BzzAgent! WOW. Where has this thing been all my life? It didn&#x27;t even feel like I was running a razor over my legs! I normally buy the cheap disposable ones because, well, they&#x27;re cheap! I did not get the chance to try out the trimmer yet, but it is definitely on my list for the near future! I already put the battery in it, as a mom who puts a lot of annoying things together for the kids, it didn&#x27;t take me long to figure out to twist the middle of the razor for battery input (I&#x27;m like a man when it comes to directions, I don&#x27;t always bother with them)&lt;br /&gt;I did one leg with my shaving cream because my super sensitive skin tends to get irritated easily. Then I did my other leg without any cream and it worked just the same! No problems! The &#x27;hypoallergenic moisturizing serum&#x27; definitely lives up to it&#x27;s nameI love that the razor glides along my legs, from my calf to my knee, talk about easy. I think I just found my new best friend! Our house was recently attacked by fleas so I haven&#x27;t shaved in weeks due to all the bites on my legs, but I took a chance today with this razor and SHED NO BLOOD. I don&#x27;t know how it did it, but finally, my husband can touch my stupid flea bitten legs without me worrying about all the fuzz he has to feel!&lt;br /&gt;The box looks great, classic Schick colors, eye-catching, lots of info about the product. I don&#x27;t know who could possibly look at this box and put it back on the shelf. Since I had got this for free, I wasn&#x27;t sure what the price of it was and now that I know, I can tell you it is definitely worth every cent. I&#x27;ll be buying replacement blades for this baby!</li>
    <li> I used to be a Venus razor girl all the way when I was in college because they were great for getting a close, smooth shave (and I got one free back in the day).  Eventually I switched to using Schick brand because I had become disenchanted with the cost of refill cartridges.  Since switching to Schick brand razors, I have felt that I was sacrificing somewhat in the quality of shave in order to save in overall cost.&lt;br /&gt;  With the TrimStyle razor I actually double checked the brand name on it while I was in the shower because the feel in my hand was so similar to what I remember from using Venus brand razors.  I was very happily surprised at the close, smooth finish to my legs after shaving and did not experience the need for multiple passes in order to get the job done.  The razor is worth the price for the actual quality and precision of the main blade.&lt;br /&gt;  As far as the trimmer head goes, I did not particularly expect to find much utility in this feature as it is not something I have tried before and it seemed a little bulky visually.  I actually found the power button to be somewhat annoying because it only worked when you were holding the button down.  It turned of as soon as you let go of it.  I can only assume that this is meant to allow greater precision, but I felt that it was a little awkward.  That said, the trimmer was actually surprisingly effective in trimming the areas that needed to go without endangering anything else.  I had plenty of control and the process was pretty effortless. The blade guard allows for 3 different length settings depending on how it is adjusted or it can be removed for a closer trim.  I was most impressed by the ability to shave over the top of my c-section scar without any tugging of the skin as this area continues to be very sensitive for me several years post surgery.  I have not found any other products that even came close to trimming effectively over scar tissue without causing painful tugging or even cutting me in the process.  This thing needs to be marketed to moms or anyone who has scarring eczema or other skin issues that cause regular razors not to work effectively for them.&lt;br /&gt;  I am highly impressed with the overall quality of this product and feel that both the razor and the trimmer are excellent products when considered on individual merits.  The fact that you can have both products in one device is an added and fantastic bonus!  Well done Schick.&lt;br /&gt;  I did receive a free sample of this product to test.he process.

    <li> I am a Bzzagent and received a  sample to try of the new schick hydro silk trimstyle razor ,razor burn and irritation are a mojor problem using razors but after trying this with the 5 curved blades and the moisture strip to prevent irritation and keeping skin moisturized  and on the other end is the trimmer with choice to choose the length you trim is great  for a perfect shave and trim ,so smooth and no irritation and trimmer can be used in or out of the water ,its waterproof. loved it so much bought my daughter one as well. #GotItFree @SchickHydroSilk</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with shaving because I have dry legs, and thick pubic hair. This razor has changed the way I look at shaving! My legs are extra hydrated from the hydrating beads, and I rarely need extra lotion anymore. The bikini trimmer is a dream, and it honestly makes shaving so much fun again! Definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free to try through BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I was given the Shick Hydro Silk TrimStyle through a BzzAgent Campaign and I&#x27;m so happy I was selected for this campaign! I love, love, love the smooth, silky, close shave this razor gives you. I usually always feel like after shaving I have a little bit of stubble but not with this razor, super close shave everyone! The bikini trimmer is a nice added plus, but I didn&#x27;t love the trimmer part as much as the razor end. It worked well, just not my thing. I would and will continue to buy this razor from now on. If you want smooth silky legs buy this!</li>
    <li> I’m one that typically buys pretty cheap razors or sometimes takes an extra one from my husband when I feel like my cheap one it’s cutting it. I received the Schick Hydro Silk Trim Style from BzzAgent and it is definitely anything but cheap. It was a small piece of luxury from my typical razor!&lt;br /&gt;I first tried the trimmer. After looking on the box for where to place the battery, I finally found the instructions on a guide on the inside of the box. It would have been nice to see a quick image on the actual box on how to install the battery. Once in place it was time to use it. When I first pressed the on box I assumed that it was stay on but was wrong. This is the biggest downfall of this razor. Although just a convenience feature, it would be nice to only have to press the button once. The trimmer worked great in the shower although it did pull my hair a little more than others I have used before.&lt;br /&gt;Next up was the razor and I was BLOWN AWAY! My legs have never been smoother! Even without shaving cream, my legs were silky smooth. Aside from being smooth, it caused no razor burns or other bumps! One downfall I did notice was that since the razor is extra-long because of the trimmer, the opposite end than what I was using did get in the way occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;While it has a few things to be improved, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor!!! It was easy to handle, and has a great moisturizing strip that kept my legs soft and smooth for a few hours after shaving. I did find the trimmer difficult to use. It did nothing for me at all. However, I will continue to use this product because of the 5 blade razor head. This is the only razor that has not cut me the very first time I used it!</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a free sample; i&#x27;m not payed for good reviews, just wanted to get out my honest opinion on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the razor I got a little nick/cut near my knee. However this must have just been me, cause I had not shaven in the while. We are barely getting back to the summer!) I have never used a trimmer before, but thought I should give the trimmer a try. I combed it through but it seemed to be doing nothing but just combing my hairs. I removed the adjustable comb thing, and this time it was snagging a bit. I honeslt am so lost on how to use a trimmer. Even looking online is a whole bunch of tutorials on trimmers for men! Those aren&#x27;t the same right? I think this package can use an instruction booklet on using the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it a second try. I shaved my legs and arms and they are very smooth! Great close shave. Unlike a lot of other razors, the handle on this one is slightly wider. In my opinion it is a lot more comfy, a way better grip! I noticed there&#x27;s like a little gel/oil thing that moisturizes the skin while shaving. Does make shaving a little more lubricated, no complaints.  The razor is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I retryed the trimmer, but unlike last time, i pressed the power button! Maybe this is why I had bad results last time. This time when i combed it through, it was actually removing hairs. This is my first trimmer, so I may be very wrong, but I feel like the trimmer is kind of unnoticeable. It hardly removes much hair. Maybe that&#x27;s how trimmers are supposed to be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I give this 4 stars, because I love the razor. I like how unlike most razors it has a wider handle. However I don&#x27;t like the trimmer too much. I expected it to be closer to stubble.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk for free from Bzzagent.com. I have really enjoyed getting the chance to use this razor. I love it, there is a moisturizing serum in the razor end that helps keep my legs smooth. The 5 blades help with making sure you get a really close shave. I love the way my legs feel afterwards. The trimmer end has 4 settings which is nice because not everyone likes the same setting, and it is waterproof. All the opinions in this are mine.</li>
    <li> This 2 in 1 razor/trimmer is awesome.  The moisture serum really leaves your legs feeling silky smooth after shaving and last several weeks.  The trimmer with adjustable settings really allows you to customize your bikini area the way you want it.  I&#x27;m prone to irritation after shaving, but with this razor/trimmer my skin is left smooth and healthy. I would highly recommend this product.  While it is a little bulky because of the combined razor trimmer, the results are well worth the bulkiness. I received the product as part of a promotion for the product.</li>
    <li> Love love love this razor. I got it as a free sample and I cannot stop raving about it. Is so convenient and leaves such a clean shave. Definitely a plus for a mommy of two!</li>
    <li> Clean, smooth fighting machine!! I love that the Schick Hydro Silk Trim Style Razor gets the job done! Skin is so smooth and perfectly trimmed! I can walk in public without hairy patches, or razor burns. I got this free product for testing purposes. However I am sure I am going to continue purchasing these razors because they are great!</li>
    <li> I wore a skirt the other day and as I was about to leave the house I looked down at my legs...scary. Now normally this would be a much longer process to shave before running out the door so I would have thrown on a pair of trusty jeans. You know, the dull disposable razor that may or may not give you tetnis and the shaving creame mess all over the place. Not with the Schick Hydro silk Trim Style razor...nope I ran to the bathroom threw my leg up on the side of the tub and comensed to shaving. It was faster than chosing a differant outfit. I am so thrilled  am thrilled with this product. I am so thankful to Bzzagent and Schick for allowing me the opportunity to try it. It makes my legs feel soft even without shaving cream because of the hydrating strip on the razor head. I love the 5 blade prescision! The trimmer makes tidying up the nether region really easy and not the chore that it once was. I now set the comb the the desired legnth or remove it completely and run it aver the area and then switch to the razor and take it clean off. It works for me in 3/4 of the time it did before. The one thing I am really curious about is how long the product will hold up for...so far so good but I want to keep this around forever!</li>
    <li> So far so good using this. I absolutely love the moisturizing strips. The larger handle makes for easy use! This razor keeps my legs feeling soft longer than ever. Another benefit - yes there&#x27;s more! - I don&#x27;t have to shave as much! Woot win win! Not to mention a happy hubby! I will say I received this as a promotion from Schick through bzzagent but I will be investing in these blades in the future!</li>
    <li> this shaver is the best one a woman can experience in the shower. It gives a silky smooth shave and u can customize the trimmer for that perfect trim to ur desire. Very hydrating on both ends. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing! My skin is so moisturized and smooth since using it.  The trimmer adds extra convenience for those spots that get missed during a shave. I should also add that my skin is very sensitive and this razor has done the job!  No irritation or bumps!</li>
    <li> I got it for free on bzzagent and honestly its totally worth it I love it I find myself not needing to shave right away when I use it BUY IT TOTALLY WORTH IT!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this razor. I have been a faithful Gillette Venus customer for a very long time, until now. I received this razor as part of a promotion from Schick and I was skeptical at first. I was pleasantly surprised after the first use. My legs are silky smooth and the razor gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Being a bzz agent I get to try amazing products and the latest is the Schick hydro silk razor. I was impressed with the razor and the shaving cream. They left my legs feeling so smooth. I love how wide the razor head is too.</li>
    <li> These razors do give a nice close shave on my legs, but I&#x27;m not sure if the added expense is justified by the results. I&#x27;ve always used the razor heads with double blades on the trusty old durable handle I&#x27;ve had for years  The moisture strip/serum is wonderful! It leaves my legs feeling smooth, moisturized, and free of cuts</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for about a month now and I am extremely pleased with it! I received it free to try from BZZZAgent. I love the two-in-one feature. It makes it easy to keep up with my grooming on the go because I don&#x27;t have to carry around multiple tools. It produces a nice, clean, smooth shave on both sides. It also leaves my legs feeling great. The battery life is also great. I haven&#x27;t had to change the battery yet. Great product!</li>
    <li> Oh the excitement I felt getting my new Schick Hydro Silk Trimstyle razor Bzzkit in the mail!  I love the the  look of the razor the sleek design and rubbery grip also that it has a little stand so the razor blade does not sit directly on the bath surface so then it can dry and prevents rust! Surprisingly the trimmer came with its battery which is rare now a days! The trimmer has a guard so you can have 4 different trim lengths! Personally I did not care too much for the trimmer even without the guard it did me no good I do a pretty good job keeping up with my bikini area. The trimmer does great in water I often have used the razor on my legs and accidentally turned on the trimmer the button is very easy to touch! The razor has 5 awesome blades that give a very good close shave and also moisturizing serum strips that replaces the skins natural moisture! I give it 4/5 stars only because I couldn&#x27;t use the trimmer to see how well it works :(&lt;br /&gt;All in all I love the razor though thanks bzzagent for sending me this for free to try! -bzzagent tazj20</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve trimmed before I shave and I&#x27;ve completely forgotten how much easier it is to do so.  It also reduces razor burns, ingrown hair, and cuts.  I love the convenience and all in one feature that it provides. I&#x27;m so happy to have received this product as part of a promotion from the brand. Free or not, I would definitely repurchase. The only complaint I have is that there is no holder I can place it in but a little wedge to place it on a flat surface so that the blades are not touching the surface for rusting purposes I assume.  So you can imagine how much room it can take up in a bathtub.  Other than that, I love the product and would recommend.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product. I&#x27;m a huge lover of Schick razors and was so excited to try this one out. I tried the trimmer first and it works ok. I&#x27;d say it rates average for a trimmer. Reminds me of a little peanut hair trimmer. It pulls a bit though when both wet and dry and being a sensitive area already it&#x27;s just not very pleasant. When trying to do the razor side it was hard for me to hold as it&#x27;s bulky and a bit thick. I was hoping to just keep it for the razor part but it&#x27;s just too hard for me to hold comfortably as I have smaller hands. Also, the razor that comes attached to it seems a bit cheap for a Schick Hydro razor. It would be nicer if they at least had a nicer razor. Overall a 3 star product as it&#x27;s a decent idea just not a good fit for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received the product free thanks to BuzzAgent</li>
    <li> The shave was super smooth. No more stealing my man&#x27;s razor for my legs. I also absolutely loved the trimmer. It works great on the bikini line as well as on eyebrows if you are careful. All in all this is awesome and I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I got this for free from Bzzagent.</li>
    <li> I am a loyal Schick customer but have only been using men&#x27;s razors as they were the only thing I thought was tough enough to give me a close shave on my thick coarse hair and still last more than one shave. This razor has definitely changed my mind. Awesome shave, moisturizes for hours, leaves my legs feeling great for more than a day straight!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor a few times and noticed a couple things I would like to change. The first thing I didn&#x27;t like was the on button. I would like to see an on/off switch rather than a button you have to just hold in. Since this is designed for your bikini area it can make it difficult to hold and use while having to hold in a button too. I was also not a fan of the razor head. I think its a little big and bulky and i found it doesn&#x27;t get a very close shave. Especially in the underarm area. I don&#x27;t want to have to use a separate razor for my under arms as well. Other than that I think its a great idea and with a few tweaks could be a great product.</li>
    <li> Legs are soo soft!!! Love it</li>
    <li> Unline my old disposable razors this one is really good and smooth to work with. Its razor does not cut the skin. It glides easily and without any discomfort. I use this along with the hydrosilk hair removal gel. It makes the while process very easy.&lt;br /&gt;i got this free from the brand during a promotion for review.</li>
    <li> I received and sample of this product for free as a Bzzagent. I typically buy disposable razors, but was excited to try this system. When I first opened the package, I was a little overwhelmed by the trimmer, but once I read the instructions and tried it out, I was immediately sold! The trimmer was easy to use and worked really well. The razor worked great! I love having the five blades; it helped get a close, comfortable shave. I was able to use the same blade for two weeks shaving every third day. The first three times I used the razor, I was even able to use it without shaving cream or soap. After that, the moisturizing serum began to wear out a bit and I used soap when I shaved. I already purchased replacement razor cartridges to continue using this shaving system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple weeks after I began using The trim style razor, my husband used it to trim his sideburns with great success.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from BzzAgent. I have used disposable razors for years simply because I didn&#x27;t see the need to buy an pricier one with more blades. Boy was I wrong. The fact that there are 5 blades help give you a super smooth finish that lasts for a few days. My legs have never felt so smooth and now i am smacking myself because I waited so long to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been about a month of using this razor and my initial thoughts still stand. It is a wonderful razor and the fact that you can trim and shave with one tool is a lifesaver. Although I originally thought it was a little bulky- I do not mind anymore. It is a good size to fit in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- worth the money. You will be impressed!</li>
    <li> After receiving this item to try for free, I&#x27;ve been won over.  Rarely do I actually buy something that I&#x27;ve sampled, but this is one razor that really worked for me.  I had to get used to the rather thick handle.  There was no way around this design characteristic because the battery had to go somewhere.  The standard razor portion worked just fine - nothing special.  But it did leave my legs smooth with minimal irritation (which is a constant problem for my pale, sensitive skin).  The real reason I will be buying this again is because of the bikini trimmer.  It&#x27;s so convenient having this attached to the razor and it really works well.  And, again, I have had NO IRRITATION!  I&#x27;ve never found a razor that provided such a smooth result.</li>
    <li> I received this razor  from bzzagent  to test for my opinion. I love it this is hands down the best razor I have ever used. I love how the razor part made my legs they were smooth for three weeks. I also love the bikini trimmer I love how you can adjust how much hair you want to remove.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this razor for a long time. It leaves your skin feeling smooth and I don&#x27;t get irritation because of the moisturizing serum and it actually leaves my skin feeling hydrated. Plus it&#x27;s great when you live in a city like Las Vegas, and it&#x27;s pool season most of the year!</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and received this this lovely product for free!!! It was one of the best free things I&#x27;ve received.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried that the trimming feature wouldn&#x27;t work properly, or that when I used it in the shower it wouldn&#x27;t really be waterproof. Well, It definitely exceeded my expectations. The trimmer was completely painless and easy to operate! And, the razor was of high quality and extremely moisturizing. I&#x27;m an avid body cream user.... I could have gone without it on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is the only initial draw-back, but after use I must say it&#x27;s going to be hard to go back to using anything else. I haven&#x27;t had to replace the actual razor part of the product so I don&#x27;t know how much that will cost yet.... but the feeling is well worth it (especially for summer).</li>
    <li> This razor worked very well as a razor. My legs were silky smooth and the smoothness lasted for several days more than with my normal razor. I found the bikini trimmer hard to use and not very effective. I ended up just using the regular razor side for my bikini area, but had already irritated it trying to use the bikini trimmer. If anything, I would buy again for the razor, not the trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever used. I got mine for free from the company through BzzAgent!! Schick always offers the closest shave without razor burn. Great for people with sensitive areas like me!!</li>
    <li> I received Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle as part of a promotion from the brand via BzzAgent. I was hesitant to try the razor at first because of how easily I get razor burn! But, the moisturizing shave the razor provides left me with no worries at all. It is such a close shave that left my legs feeling silky and smooth! The bikini trimmer is absolutely perfect and a must have for impromptu beach trips this summer. The different settings allowed me to get just the right look. The entire razor is very easy to hold and use. Just a note: I did have to push the on button harder than I had expected for the bikini trimmer. A quick push simply turned the razor on and then immediately off. But once I pushed it down harder I had no problems. Great razor and trimmer...my new favorites!</li>
    <li> I received this a few weeks ago, for free for the purpose of my review, and my favorite thing is the close smooth shave on my legs when using the razor end with it turned on.  Plus the moisturizer works great! If you don&#x27;t want a super close smooth shave for the bikini area, then use the trimmer! 4 different length settings! I personally like it to be a closer trim than what this can do and that&#x27;s the only reason I only gave 4 stars. But totally worth the buy!</li>
    <li> It has five blades so it shaves very close, the moisturizer bar works great you don&#x27;t even have to use shave gel if you are in a bind and don&#x27;t have any, legs get left very smooth and soft. The trimmer works great and does exactly what you want it to. It is a little on the sharp side so you have to be careful but sharp is a good thing. The guard is a great add on, I like using the first setting I think it is with it all the way down. The &amp;#34;kick stand&amp;#34; is also great because if keeps the blades away from the surface you place it on. I actually use to buy the male version of this razor, off and on, for a few years and I am glad that they are finally making it in a female version. I like the looks of female razors but they always seamed to not be as good as male razors. I have to say this one changed my mind. It works really well and preforms exactly how I like a razor to preform. The only draw back in my mind is I wish that there was some kind of cover for the blades when it is not being used. Other then that seriously an AWESOME razor!</li>
    <li> I recieved a free Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor as part of a BZZAgent campaign to test and review and let me say, I am very impressed!  I love the hydro silk razor, I always get a nice close shave without any razor burn and my legs are always so soft after!  Even after a few weeks of use I am getting close shaves like it&#x27;s the first time (don&#x27;t you hate when razors only give you a couple good shaves?!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric trimmer was great-- but I found it worked best when bikini hair was on the longer side.. I don&#x27;t typically let it get that &amp;#34;out of control&amp;#34; but for the sake of a review I was willing to give it a shot... I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d continue using it this way- but for girls who keep their bikini hair a little longer- this would be great for your trimming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is a great tool with multiple uses for women, buy!</li>
    <li> I received this razor from BzzAgent to try for FREE. I was skeptical about trying it at first since I am a venus razor girl. However, I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this. It gets such a close shave and the trimmer is a blessing with the bikini line, especially since summer is upon us. I would recommend this to anyone. You can not go wrong with this razor</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® Razor through BzzAgent and am hooked!  The larger Hydro Silk razor on one end is so moisturizing that I didn&#x27;t even need to use a shave gel!  The smaller end is awesome for trimming up the bikini area - no water even needed (which is perfect for on-the-go, quick shaves)!  Before using this razor, I was a loyal fan of Schick&#x27;s Quattro for Women, but I have to say that I made a switch to this new Hydro Silk® TrimStyle®.  It leaves legs super soft with a nice, close shave.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from BzzAgent to try out and give my honest feedback. I&#x27;ve been using the razor for a few weeks and I absolutely love it! My legs are silky smooth and the trimmer works great. I really like that fact that the trimmer can be used with or without the clip and that they&#x27;re are multiple lengths with the clip. I will definitely continue to use this razor/trimmer and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Awesome. I got this as a free sample. The electric razor is perfect for the bikini area and you still have the classic close shave from the typical razor head. My only criticism is that it is rather clunky.</li>
    <li> Loving my new Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle I got for free to try from BzzAgent.  It&#x27;s quiet and super convenient. I really like the fact that it is waterproof for use in the shower. With the 5 blades and 3 setting trimmer, this little gem will be my go to this swimsuit season!</li>
    <li> I got this free to review from bzzagent and was completely floor at the schick hydro silk trimmer was amazing i got to use it in and out of the shower, the one problem i had was getting the battery compartment open, specially with long nails like i have it was so not easy! even the twist but i guess that is exactly what they want for a water tight seal. other than that since i have to shave every single day it was one of those products that i used and didn&#x27;t have to! Every other day would work amazing for it! Also another issue was it did pull hair not all the time but some would get stuck in the razor bead that they use for bikini trimming and it would pull, i would suggest trimming your hair down a bit if its over an inch mines short so it pulling them had me a bit confused&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: &amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review). I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
    <li> The razor itself is amazing and so incredibly smooth. You can&#x27;t even feel it&#x27;s shaving but it is and it&#x27;s a super smooth and close shave! The combo is awesome and I was so surprised I could use it in the shower with no complaints!!</li>
    <li> I received this as a free sample through BzzAgent and I was excited to try it only to be disappointed. I love the Schick brand but this product didn&#x27;t live up to the Schick brand. When I went to use the trimmer I couldn&#x27;t get any hair off so I ended up taking the guard off and used the trimmer without the guard and still not much hair came off and what did was rather painful I think cause there isn&#x27;t enough power to properly cut. The razor side works great and left my legs smooth.</li>
    <li> Worked okay for my needs. Like the adjustable head for the trimmer. Nice size as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was unhappy I had to replace the head after the first use, the moisturizing strip came off.. The heads, in my opinion, are slightly expensive for what they&#x27;re used for.</li>
    <li> I have been using Schick Hydro Silk razors since I first heard about them. I used to only use Venus. After using this razor the first time and seeing how much softer my skin was and how close of a shave I received, I never looked back. Then a couple of weeks ago from BzzAgent and Schick, I was offered to try the TrimStyle. The trimmer on the end works well for long hair. It says that the trimmer is for the bikini area. After trying I would rather just stick with my normal Silk razor since it gets much closer and I do not have to go over again.</li>
    <li> I always used to use the regular electric shavers and they were always too bulky. This product is great! I love the fact you can adjust the trimming length. The top pops off easy for fast cleaning and it stores away in a small drawer. Plus the fact it&#x27;s safe in the shower is great also. I don&#x27;t use mine in the shower I only use the electric end and use my other razors in the bath. I hope this helps it last longer. I received as nick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini Trimmer as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a trial, but I would definitely purchase it again and recommend it to friends! The razor gave me a smooth, close shave and the moisturizing strip left my legs silky and soft. The battery operated bikini shaver had several adjustments for the guard, and my favorite was the closest shave. It was really easy to use, and my bikini area was swimsuit ready after shaving! The razor&#x27;s handle was comfortable and easy to hold. What a great product.</li>
    <li> I Normally do NOT use a females razor. I feel I get a closer shave with a man razor they seem sharper and dull less easily. I tried this product with an open mind because Schick was my go to brand prior to switching. First of all I do like this razor the features with the trimmer are excellent. The closeness with the shave is OK. and the over all design is quite functional. However with the bad news. The design with the blade , The gunk on the blade I suppose to moisture the skin SUCKS. After awhile of using it I realized this crap is gooey and rubs off easily. Not to mention the blade just randomly falls off constantly and its not easy to get it to stay back on . Not sure if I got a faulty one or what but hey I received it free through BZZAgent and gave it a shot. The closeness of shave I get on my legs is Good however can be patchy and isn&#x27;t as close as I would like because I am having to shave more often using this razor . I do NOT recommend (blade end)for Bikini line nor underarms because to me with my hair  which isn&#x27;t coarse and rather thin doesn&#x27;t get a close shave at all. and have a &amp;#34;shaddow&amp;#34; where you can still see hair. The trimmer is amazing especially for coarser hair and my husband likes the trimmer better then Gillette&#x27;s. I guess with a few tweaks to this product it could be amazing. I would recommend this product even though it hasn&#x27;t worked well for me, However it would be for tween and teens .</li>
    <li> I want to say that this product has most definitely changed my life.  it leaves my skin feeling smooth but most importantly it glided without any irritation this is a must  buy. #gotitfree</li>
    <li> So I got this free from BzzAgent. This is a great product in theory. I love that I can both shave and scape in the shower, since it&#x27;s waterproof. And the trimmer works really well, with good power and length options. I just don&#x27;t love the Hydro Silk razor! It&#x27;s not that flexible, doesn&#x27;t hydrate all that well and seems to miss a lot. It makes me miss my Gillette Venus razor, which I continually reach for instead. So, since I now have both in my shower, it defeats the convenience of the combo. But it looks cute!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a brand promotion and I think it works great! I love the 5 blades and the convenient battery powered groomer. The only downfall is that you have to hold down the power button while you use the groomer. I wish there was an on/off switch instead.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from bzzagent for a promotion from Schick. I am overall very pleased with the razor and trimmer, especially the razor. It gives an effortless, close, smooth shave and the moisturizing strips keep my skin feeling hydrated. I never have to go over the same spots over and over like with other razors. I didn&#x27;t have experience with trimmers before, but this one seems to work well and has 4 different lengths to choose from - it was a painless trim! I like that it can be used in the shower as well.</li>
    <li> I already use Schick Hydro Silk razors, so when I received the Trim Style to try for free I was all for it. Here&#x27;s the good, the good, and the not-so-bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, what is it? Well it is a lubricated five-blade razor with an attached trimmer that can be used either dry or wet. The trimmer has four settings from super close to a decent length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the good. I really like the five-blade razor. You get a close shave without worrying about nicking yourself, and personally I liked the wide grip of the razor, which is wide for necessity&#x27;s sake of the trimmer battery and motor. The battery, which came in the package, was easy to load, and the trimmer was easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the not-so-bad; I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the moisturizing serum in the razor. It just comes in two strips flanking the blades, and while not bad, I didn&#x27;t really find it made much of a difference. The bad part was it does bubble up after a period of time, and while I haven&#x27;t found it to interfere with the shave, I could see how it could annoy some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a good razor. I&#x27;m not a huge &amp;#34;trimmer,&amp;#34; so I do not know if I could justify the cost, but if you are, then the Hydro Silk Trim Style could be the product for you.</li>
    <li> I like this razor, but not enough to switch from my current brand. I was provided one to review for free through BzzAgent. The moisturizing strip was great and I just used a bit of regular soap to help it along. I&#x27;ve used the razor for a few weeks now and the strip has dissolved ~4 mm on each side but is still  largely intact. While the shave is smooth, it gave me razor burn on my legs which I do not get when using my regular razor (which is not Schick brand). I also usually use a razor along my bikini line and I had razor burn and felt like the stubble came back faster. I do like the option to use the buzzer and guard and it works ok. Sometimes I can go over the same area more than once and it just glides over the hair without cutting any off. I also wanted to try it on my arm and upper lip and it tugged out hair in both spots.</li>
    <li> I got this product from bzzagent.com for free as part of a promotion of the brand. This is an excellent product with hydration while you shave. The bikini trimmer is very handy and excellent to use to get the bakini area all situated in minutes!</li>
    <li> This product was a good idea but with major design flaws. The hanging hook (?) on the device gets in the way of your shaving, the design prevents the plain razor side from reaching tight spacing in &amp;#34;lady land&amp;#34; and the electric razor metal is sharp... sharp enough to cut me in several spots and make me bleed in a very sensitive area. Yes, the electric razor side comes with a shaving guide but I found this guide to be absolutely useless. Even at the shortest guide it barely removed any hair at all, nearly none. Also, I suggest you dont use this when your skin is at all moist. My skin was just normally moist, not from the shower or anything and I had problems. The electric side, with or without the the guide, sticks to moist skin and pulls at the skin. Sometimes so much so it was pulling the guide completely off the device.  I gave this 2 stars because the plain razor side is REALLY sharp which is nice but the comfort gel strip gives off way too much slime or serum. I still had to switch back to my old razor to fully shave the area clean. Because of this and the scrapes from sharp electric razor side, I wont be reusing this product. Even though the plain razor side was nice, the bulky design isnt worth switching over from my old razor just to use the one side. Wait for the remodel if you plan to purchase this product and save yourself and your lady place from major irritation... or just by the razor in the refillable version. I was provided this item for free from BuzzAgent, the review and opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> This razor is truly amazing. I typically use my husbands razor because I don&#x27;t get a close enough shave with a woman&#x27;s razor. I was pretty skeptical about this one thinking that it would not give me a close smooth shave like my hubbys.  To my surprise it was AMAZING. Not only did it give me a really close shave but left my legs soft and moisturized, no razor burn for me. I highly recommend this razor it is amazing.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle®.  I live in California.  Six months of the year I spend 75% of my time in a bikini.  Let me tell you upkeep has never been by favorite part.  I am not know for my precision and excellence in hand-eye coordination when it comes to a trim style.  What is made to look like  a strip, is more of a wobbly L.  Even length? Never. Patches and bald spots? Always.  Well not ANYMORE. I have a design now that has actually given me confidence (and compliments) that I did myself.  No more waxing, no more hassle.  Shave my legs, trim my zone, done.  The serum in the blades makes my skin smooth and bump free.  This product has changed my life!</li>
    <li> I really like how smooth the shave is, granted I have only used the product once. The trimmer part is especially nice because it has the 4 length setting choices. The width of the razor makes it easy to hold during the process. The one small thing I would want to add is a plastic razor head guard for when I&#x27;m not using it. It&#x27;s a minor thing that not everyone will care about, but I think it would complete the product and make it a full 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller I recommend both!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried another electric razor before, and this one works great! Haven&#x27;t had any problems with the button or anything else other people have had trouble with.</li>
    <li> Very practical, love it!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this regularly, which makes me very happy.</li>
    <li> This razor is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. The razor itself works great -- the 5 blades do what they&#x27;re supposed to do and the moisturizing strip is legitimately awesome. And the trimmer is fantastic! One AAA battery is all it needs (I&#x27;ve used it at least 10 times and haven&#x27;t needed to change it yet). I haven&#x27;t needed to move the comb setting, but it&#x27;s great that there&#x27;s customization in terms of hair length. The fact that they&#x27;re both on the same device, and that the oversized handle fits sturdily in my hand, makes this a real winner. I got this product as a free sample from BzzAgent, but will definitely be continuing to use it and likely even purchasing another for my gym bag!</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent I got the Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® razor free. This thing is crazy cool. It seems like it would be too big and heavy to shave with, but the size and weight are actually perfect for making my legs silky smooth. The trimmer does a fine job on the bikini area, too. Only problem with it is the buzzing is a little like a sex toy LOLOL! So be sure to take the battery out before you pack it for a trip.</li>
    <li> I got my razor through BzzAgent to try out and The Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor is probably my second favorite razor out there! I love the waterproof trimmer, with its adjustable settings. It&#x27;s super easy to use and very convenient. I like the razor blades that are used with it, but they aren&#x27;t as good as the ones I normally use, but I have very sensitive legs, and almost all razors cause irritation for me. But the blades that came with this razor barely bothered me at all.  I will definitely continue using the trimmer, but I will probably go back to my regular razors.</li>
    <li> I received this for free to try but I absolutely love this razor and will totally buy one when this quits!  I&#x27;ve had the Schick Hydro razor in the past and knew how much I enjoyed using it, now its even better when you can just flip it over and trim up your bikini areas!  The razor&#x27;s five blades are awesome at getting a super close shave and the trimmer has an adjustable guard on it so you can remove it and get super close or slide it up/down to get a length that works for you. This will be perfect for traveling to summer events or weekends away because its 2 in 1 and is one less thing to pack!</li>
    <li> The TrimStyle razor is a two in one-  razor on one end, electric trimmer on the other.  Love the razor side, not at all a fan of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle of the razor is a little thicker than most, which gives it a nice comfortable feel in my hand.  The blades are amazing, though the built in moisturizer strip doesn&#x27;t last as long.  I also found that shortly after shaving, I&#x27;d have to lotion up.  Not a big deal since that&#x27;s the normal routine, but it did say that it&#x27;d keep on moisturizing.  It did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer side is nice in theory- it has 3 different length settings and operated on a double-A battery. BUT it just will not cut / shave / trim anything.  Seriously- I even ran it down my arm because I thought I was losing my mind.  Nooope.  Well.. yeah- but not about this!  Anyway, the razor does what a razor is supposed to do, but it&#x27;s not anything Earth-shattering in the world of leg-shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was sent to me for free from BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this at all it wasn&#x27;t the worst but it was way to big.</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I recently tried out this product. The first time I used the Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® razor, I went &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34;. It gives an amazingly close shave, which lasts for many days. The shape of the blade is nice, and the razor is flexible enough to go over the contours of the knees and elbows. Be extra careful the very first time you use it though - you may end up with nicks and cuts because the blades go over your skin very smoothly (which you may not be used to!). Once you get used to the motion of the blades, they are super easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also remember to use the razor directly on your skin after wetting the blades in water. There is also a water-activated gel within the razor, which means you do not need any extra product like moisturizing shave gel (which in turn saves you money, woohoo!). Initially, I felt like there was too much of the gel from the razor, which gave it a gooey appearance. But again, the next few times, the amount of gel was good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One really cool thing I noticed is that I did not get ANY bumps after I used this product, so that&#x27;s definitely a HUGE plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how long the blades last... so I shall update this when I have more info. All in all, it is the best product I have used so far over all these years (incl. disposable &amp; reusable).</li>
    <li> I had been using the Schick Hydro Silk regular razor for quite sometime and I thought that it was the greatest...until, I tried the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my past experiences with the regular razor, I had always been totally satisfied with it&#x27;s performance in comfort and closeness in shaving my legs and armpits, but in maintaining my bikini area...it feel highly short. Between it and the scissors, I was always in great fear of cutting or nicking myself in that ever most sensitive area of my body. I hated doing anything with that part of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, I love maintaining that area. Along with no longer feeling afraid of hurting myself, I also am not irritated because with the trimmer, I am able to do an even cut. No long hairs in one area, then short scratching stubble in another. And time saving! My previous method was a two step process, one in out of the shower and one in. Now, one easy, efficient step&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my I add, my husband noticed too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product! Good job Schick! Thank you for letting me try it for free through BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free through BzzAgent. I love the double head on this razor, one side for shaving the other for trimming. It takes care of all my body hair with one product!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a free sample from Schick to review this exciting new product, and I have to say, it&#x27;s great so far! I already owned the Schick Hydro Razor, and I was interested to see how the trimming aspect of it would work. It&#x27;s so convenient to have both parts in one device. But I have to say, it is a bit clunky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor aspect of it gives a close shave and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation. The trimming side of it works wonders. There are 3 settings to choose from. This is the first product that works great without he use of shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is for the clunkiness and because it can be difficult to keep the power button on. Sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to keep the power on without holding down the button. This can be a pain but eventually it works. It just needs the right touch.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a great razor. I received this for free from BzzAgent, and I am so glad I did! The regular razor gives you a super smooth, close shave. The bikini trimmer has 4 adjustable settings, which makes it very convenient. The only thing I do not like about this razor is the placement of the power button. When using the regular razor, I always hit the power button when trying to grip the razor. This is definitely not a deal breaker for me, it is just mildly inconvenient. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for the convenience of a 2-1 razor.</li>
    <li> This razor/trimmer is like nothing else on the market. It glides seamlessly and effortlessly even in the most tender areas around the bikini area. No knicks, cuts, or scraps like traditional razors. I received mine from Bzzagent for free to try out and review. I&#x27;m overly impressed folks. My legs are smoother than they have been for years. They also seem more moisturized and less ashy then before using traditional razors. The trimmer is also battery operated with allows you to make a design if you want without having to snag those curly duds below.</li>
    <li> I received this free from BzzAgent so I could try it out and give my review.  I&#x27;ve used similar razors in the past and the razor worked just fine.  However, my boyfriend saw the trimmer on the end and started using it to trim his beard!  He loves it!  He uses the trimmer to trim up his beard and uses the razor to shave his neck.  Now I&#x27;m going to have to go get my own!</li>
    <li> I recently received the schick hydro silk Trimstyle razor to try out for free. I must admit I was a little skeptical at first but no more. I am in love with it. I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to my old razors. Not only are my legs super soft and silky, but I&#x27;m ready to rock that bikini. No more will I sneak my husbands trimmer now that I have my own. It&#x27;s super fast and easy so use. It&#x27;s even waterproof so you can pretty much trim anywhere. The only drawback it has that took some getting used to is the handle is wider and heavier so it took some time before it felt comfortable in my hand.</li>
    <li> i received this as a free product to test out and io love every second of it since i received it</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t imagine my life without this razor now! Ithe five blades get&#x27;s me a close shave  plus it makes trimming up the zone WAY easier with the waterproof trimmer. Since my skin is super sensitive, the hypoallergenic serum was a bonus. I&#x27;ve tried other brands (Venus, Bic, and even men&#x27;s Gillette) but I&#x27;ve found that my skin doesn&#x27;t react to the moisture strip which means it worked. It fits pretty well in the hand and isn&#x27;t too awkward to hold while trimming. I&#x27;d give it a full five stars if the moisture bar didn&#x27;t run out so quickly. Definitely suggest investing in some shaving cream after the third or fourth shave. Though I was able to try this razor out as a promotion from Schick, coupons are a major must when buying the product.</li>
    <li> Love the Schick Hudro Silk Trimstyle razor!!! Great close shave, smooth skin. Also love the fact that the trimmer is included so not having to tote two individual items. Thank you BzzAgent and Schick for letting me try this product free!! I recommend this to everyone. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of person that switches razors all the time. I buy whatever is on sale since they are so expensive. When I received my Schick razor in the mail from Schick directly I figured it would be just like all the rest. When I opened the package the first thing I noticed was it didn&#x27;t have a big moisture soap thing like all other razors. Instead it had little dots.&lt;br /&gt;When I finally used the razor I was shocked at how well it did. It provided just enough moisture and felt very comfortable. I never once thought it would drop it. The bikini trimmer is nice because you can change the height of the guard. I&#x27;m not really sure what the vibrating button is suppose to do but it works fine without it. My only complaint was the little moisture dots start oozing out after one use. Would be nice if there was a way to stop that. Over all best razor I have used.</li>
    <li> Even though I feel like this product is a little pricey, I absolutely love it and would probably purchase a new one if something happened to the one I have. I received it as part of a promotion for the brand through BzzAgent, and while I&#x27;m normally very skeptical about razor products, I started out hopeful because I had already recently switched to Schick Hydro refillable razors after 15 years of loyally using Venus, so I already knew I liked the razor part. It&#x27;s a very smooth and versatile razor that gives a great shave, protects your skin from irritation afterward, and doesn&#x27;t have a bulky design that prevents it from going everywhere it&#x27;s needed easily. The two-sided aspect of this product has made my shaving routine so much more convenient and less time consuming. It&#x27;s got multiple length options on the trimmer, and I was surprised by how easy to hold and maneuver it is without being bulky. I hate having a razor that I have to struggle with just to move it around without dropping it! I also love that I only have to keep up with one shaving tool now, and it even has little wedges on the bottom that keep it from laying flat on the tub and getting gross if you store it in the shower. Over all, I was really impressed with this product, and I&#x27;d recommend purchasing it.</li>
    <li> This razor is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I recieved the razor as part of a promotion through bzzagent and Schick. The leg razor moisturizes your legs while you shave them. The Trimstyle razor really shortens and shapes your bikini area hair. I love it so much. I don&#x27;t have any cons.</li>
    <li> Beach body ready! Well, at least my legs and bikini area are. lol I was so lucky to have received this razor free to try out and give my opinion. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much as I&#x27;ve never had good luck with trimmers. I fell in love with the new Schick Hydro Silk® TrimStyle® razor! It&#x27;s not bulky like most trimmers and did a fantastic job! It was super easy and quiet. You can take the trimmer head off to get a closer trim if you want. No knicks or cuts! Ready to get your legs smooth as silk? Flip the razor over and start shaving. I love how silky smooth my legs are from this razor. This is a definite keeper!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free through a campaign with Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;I must admit I was a little intimidated by this razor before I opened it. But i must say I&#x27;m in love with it. This is by the far the smoothest &amp; most gentle shave ever!! Literally feels like silk shaving my legs. Other razors you can feel it pulling the hairs out, not this one! The handle is nice and thick and very easy to hold. Doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hands due to the rubber gripping. The bikini trimmer part is convenient too. Although I could live without that part.. Overall I would definitely recommend this razor and I will only be using this from now on!</li>
    <li> I got a free razor from @BzzAgent, and I love it. The only thing I noticed, was the serum and shave cream together. After the first few uses, the serum is so much better. I used to buy men&#x27;s razors due to the ability to get through coarse hair, but now I just use this!</li>
    <li> ~*~ I tried this product for free thanks to BzzAgent and Schick. ~*~&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Men&#x27;s Schick Hydro for years and have never had a complaint. I normally can&#x27;t use women&#x27;s razors without my skin getting irritated, and I have tried everything I could think of. I tried this one and the only time my skin gets irritated is when I shave again too soon. I also love how I don&#x27;t seem to need to shave as often as I usually do. Which is great because I am a stay at home mom of 2 little girls (2 1/2 and 5 months) that constantly keep me on the run, and I do not have a lot of time to spend on shaving. The bikini trimmer is super quiet, which is also a HUGE plus for me. I tend to shave while the girls are napping, and I do not have to worry about the noise waking either of them up. Only thing I dislike is that the moisture strip will activate if it is left in the shower. So I strongly suggest putting the razor somewhere else where it will not get wet when done. Unless you like a gooey mess in your shower and go through razor heads quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING moisture for my skin&lt;br /&gt;Quiet trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Longer lasting shave&lt;br /&gt;Durable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;easily activated moisture strip will get wasted if left in shower</li>
    <li> Yes! I love this razor and trimmer duo! I got it free via bzzagent.com, but all thoughts and opinions are my own. This is by far the best Schick razor I&#x27;ve owned and makes my legs super smooth! I love the duality of the trimmer and where I was a little scared to use it at first, it certainly does it&#x27;s job. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and it&#x27;s still going strong. My only complaints are the bulky weight to it makes it a little clumsy to use, and I&#x27;ve dropped it more than I&#x27;d like to admit. I also wish the gel on the razor lasted longer than 3 shaves. I look forward to replacing the razor head when the time comes. A new shower staple indeed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m normally a customer of Schick Hydro Silk. It&#x27;s my go-to razor. I did receive the TrimStyle via BzzAgent for free so I just had to try it! I will say that the razor head is just like my other Schick Hydro Silk ones. I know people complain about the &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;drool&amp;#34; but I actually like it since my legs are super sensitive and that &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; helps in razor burn afterwards unlike a Venus does for me. I love how it shaves. It&#x27;s nice, close, clean and honestly after two swipes, get&#x27;s everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual trim part though, I never thought about getting a trimmer. Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use it. There&#x27;s not really clear instructions but I&#x27;ve seen my husband use one for his beard. It&#x27;s a bit weird at first and doesn&#x27;t get a ton of hair at once. I do like how there are different levels. You can take off the plastic part to get closer which I liked and actually used on the sensitive parts of my legs. Overall, I would probably buy another Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor when this one dies. I just love Schick razors, they are the best!</li>
    <li> This razor the 2-in-1 trim style razor is a great concept but I think they need to work on improving the trimmer side! It doesn&#x27;t get a close shave the regular razor side does a great job gives both a close and smooth shave everytime! Only thing is buying refills can be pricy.. But all refillable razor cartridges are! I did receive this product complimentary from Bzzz Agent for review!</li>
    <li> I love the improvements they&#x27;ve made since this type of razor first came out. It now has an extra piece on it that acts as a stand to keep the razor from touching whatever surface it is sitting on, this helps preserve the blade life.  The new moisture strips also add a nice touch.  My favorite part id being able to take care off all my shaving needs with one device and the fact that it&#x27;s a wet/dry razor makes it even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I was given a free sample of this razor to try, but that did not affect my review at all.</li>
    <li> I was sent this razor by BzzAgent to review, which was really exciting! The downfall to the timing was that I was nine months pregnant upon receiving this razor and as anyone can guess, the huge belly kind of gets in the way of shaving legs, let alone &amp;#34;trimming&amp;#34; anything else up. However, I figured it would be as good a time as any to truly put this razor to the test since I would soon be silently judged by my OB and a small army of L&amp;D nurses in regards to my ability to shave and keep everything smooth and tidy. I have to say, the razor itself is excellent. It&#x27;s by far the longest lasting razor I&#x27;ve owned, as it cleans out really well so tiny hairs don&#x27;t get gunked up and left behind. It also did a great job of not cutting up my legs like other razors have, especially considering that I was pretty much shaving blind and unable to see what I was doing for the most part. The razor cartridge also has some nice moisture to it, which I found eliminates the need for shaving cream as long as your legs aren&#x27;t dry to begin with. I&#x27;ve also looked into the price of replacement cartridges and I totally think they&#x27;re worth it for the quality you&#x27;re getting. It&#x27;s a similar shave to the schick intuition, but lasts through repeated uses, which makes it much more economical. The trimmer, however, I personally have found to be pointless. If your intentions are to simply trim up as in snip a little length off the lady bush but still leaving a good amount of hair, then it will probably be what you want. However, I prefer a closer shave and personally this did not cut it. I was hoping it would help to remove unwanted hair on the bikini line specifically as it suggests, but my hair is fine and thin, this trimmer thing didn&#x27;t do anything to it. The razor, however, was perfect and didn&#x27;t even cut me up despite the fact that I literally was trying to shave according to memory. And yes, the team of medical professionals attending my birth did compliment my excellent bush maintenance abilities (and my cute DIY pedicure, another true feat over nature). So while I&#x27;ve found the trimmer to be useless I&#x27;ll say, I would absolutely recommend this razor because it&#x27;s the best (and honestly safest) one I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ll continue to buy cartridges to use it again myself!abilities (and my cute DIY pedicure, another true feat over nature).

    <li> These razors give a close shave that leaves you feeling so smooth. You can tell immediately after shaving that all the hair has been cut as close to the skin as possible. I&#x27;m hooked on these razors and their 5 blade shaving capability.</li>
    <li> Great great great! I was avraid of using this on more sensative area, but it works very well. And the razor have exchangable blades.</li>
    <li> perfect and does not knick the skin</li>
    <li> Not the great product it was made out to be. Still better off using hubby&#x27;s stuff and a regular ole women&#x27;s blade razor. Just new packaging and some faulty advertising.</li>
    <li> OMG, the lady parts trimmer is amazing! Started on level 3, then down to 2, then 1, then no cover. I think I like the 1 best but you have to see what works best for you. Even comes with the battery! This is the best lady parts idea ever! Mine stayed on for no problem. Things down there stay nice and clean for a long time! Hated using a razor or scissors, yikes. This vibrates but is not loud and does not hurt. The razor is awesome, gives me baby legs and understand that last a little longer that my old razor. You might be surprised how clean and sexy you feel with the trimmer. I never waxed and cremes down there are stinky and can irritate. Thank you, Shick. Had to be developed by women!!!</li>
    <li> Two thumbs up! Received this product complimentary from Bzzagent!</li>
    <li> The trimmer on the razor worked fine.  I was surprised no water has worked its way into the battery compartment. The razor part works like any disposable razor.  I can&#x27;t say this razor was anything that special. The Down side is the cost.  The replacement blades are a little on the costly side. All in all this is not a bad razor.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me, your shower is cluttered with a few different razors and razor blades. While I have always been loyal to the Schick brand, I have never been loyal to one specific razor. I&#x27;ve spent the past 16 years that I&#x27;ve been shaving trying to find my favorite razor to use. Prior to receiving my complimentary TrimSyle courtesy of BzzAgent I was using the Schick Quattro For Women with the orange handle. While I love the four blades on the Quattro, I still felt like I was getting a rough shave after just a few uses. I am happy to say, however, that my search for my favorite razor is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about the Schick Hydro SIlk TrimStyle when I took it out of the package was the wide handle that it has. Prior to using the TrimStyle I assumed that I wouldn&#x27;t like the wide handle because my other razor was much skinnier. Boy was I wrong! I absolutely love the wide handle of the TrimStyle! It fits perfectly in my hand and even offers more control than my Schick Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry skin so the fact that the TrimStyle is a hydrating razor is a huge draw to me. There are many times when I am in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to lather my legs with shaving cream. This razor works great with just soap. I love the feeling that the hydrating serum gives my legs. I normally knick myself every time I break out a fresh razor blade. That didn&#x27;t happen with the TrimStyle! The hydrating serum also helps the razor navigate around tricky areas like the back and front of my knee caps. My legs feel so smooth and moisturized when I step out of the shower. The fact that the TrimStyle boasts a five blade razor blade is also a noteworthy attribute since my prior razor was a four blade. Who knew how much of a difference one blade can make!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been many times when I have been stuck using my boyfriends trimmer for my lady parts. Those times are now over. I love the fact that I now have my razor and trimmer all in one place! I can shave my legs, then flip the razor over and trim up other parts. The trimmer also comes with an adjustable comb that has four different settings. I have only used one of the settings so far, but I am sure that over time, I will use the other settings.I have used the trimmer both in and out of the shower and it truly is a waterproof product. I have had no issues with it in the shower. It currently hangs in my shower and gets wet on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only found one real potential issue with this razor. There have been times that I have been shaving my legs and I accidentally hit the button for the trimmer. This could totally be just me and the way I hold the razor. This would in no way deter me from buying this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor comes packaged with a fresh battery and the great part is that when you need a new one it take a AAA. No special batteries or a trip to a special store needed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use the TrimStyle on a daily basis and I would highly recommend it to anyone curious about using it!place!

    <li> Great razor and got everything down to the skin. The only thing they should change is the size but other then that it is a GREAT razor! I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I have used several different types of Shick razors including Hydro Silk, but never a razor and trimmer in one. For the razor I would say it does a good job, but I don&#x27;t feel that it gives me a close shave due to the extreme moisturizing strip. Also the head is so bulky around the razor blades that sometimes you have to go over the hair twice to completely moisturizing strip. Also the head is so bulky around the razor blades that sometimes you have to go over the hair twice to completely get a good shave. I think the men&#x27;s Hydro five and the disposable Quattro Titanium give a closer shave. The trimmer, I love. I had never seen a razor or trimmer in 1 until I received this complimentary from BzzAgent for testing purposes. I like that you can keep it in the shower with all the rest of your razors and shave your legs and just flip it over and get your delicates in shape with the press of a button. It will trim in four different adjustable settings so you can get things just right. Overall I think this is a great product it does require a battery which comes with it. I would definitely make this purchase and recommend this to everyone looking for convenience when shaving.</li>
    <li> I received this free as part of promotion. My legs were very smooth with no cuts. It doesnt leave any red spots and my hair did not grow thicker than before.</li>
    <li> It is what it is....razor didn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Works good no complaints!</li>
    <li> One of the few razors that doesnt give me razor burn. I have super sensitive skin too.</li>
    <li> Great razor and trimmer. Would recommend and buy again</li>
    <li> BEST RAZOR I EVER BOUGHT. didn&#x27;t buy from Amazon, bought at CVS -in store. Marked as $12 but had a $1 off coupon on the box. Also got $3 in &amp;#34;CVS Extra Bucks&amp;#34; which is like in-store credit, for purchasing the box of 5 replacement blades for $20. I have very sensitive skin and have always suffered from razor burn and in grown hairs especially in my bikini area. I have been using this product for about 1 month with the original blade (probably time to change it out now) and im thrilled at how smooth my skin is. No razor bumps or ingrown hairs at all, anywhere on my body! Highly suggest it ladies. Its worth the money! - nothing to say about this particular seller tho or Amazon, because like I said I bought it at my local CVS pharmacy. I have purchased from Amazon before and always been pleased.</li>
    <li> This is great to use in the shower, and give you a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> The trimmer function on this razor is so so.  It&#x27;s not going to leave smooth skin and can give you razor burn.  The razor part is really good, gives a close shave and helps with nicks.</li>
    <li> Works good as a razor doing legs and underarms.  The trimming side is just o.k.  It doesn&#x27;t get a close as one might want for a bikini but if you use the razor afterwards, it is certainly better than just a razor on it&#x27;s own.  It&#x27;s sturdy and fits well in the and but replacing the blades can be a bit of a challenge and I&#x27;ve noticed it really doesn&#x27;t like sitting on the little built in shelf in the shower.  When it falls off, the razor will come off, just doesn&#x27;t attach real well.  For what it cost, it certainly is less than buying a separate razor and trimmer so I&#x27;m good.</li>
    <li> great razor- I used the trimmer side to do a line up under my pony tail. so much easier then paying for and then using a big ol clunky set of trimmers. havn&#x27;t tried it where the commercial suggests to try it yet but when that time comes around i&#x27;ll keep it to myself &#x3D;P</li>
    <li> Great razor and trimmer!</li>
    <li> I like the trimmer part of this just fine. But the &amp;#34;Hydro&amp;#34; part of the razor end is not well designed.&lt;br /&gt;The lubricant comes out in little holes next to the razor blades and dries there. So when you try to shave, the lumps from the lubricant don&#x27;t move (they&#x27;ve dried) and leave strips on my legs untouched by the razor. Plus the lubricant is kinda slimy gross goop when it does work. I end up scrubbing it off after (trying) to shave. I&#x27;ve even tried to scrape off the hardened lubricant to no avail. As you can see in the photo I&#x27;ve attached, the lubricant sticks out and blocks the blades. Scraping off the hardened goop is difficult to impossible.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer end is perfect. Why didn&#x27;t I have one of these things before? Don&#x27;t change a thing on the trimmer end.&lt;br /&gt;Just ditch the goop.</li>
    <li> It is a great product for the price. It can be used under water which is a big plus. It gives a great trim almost close to skinned but if you need it further the razor cleans it completely quickly without hassle.</li>
    <li> Totally the best shaver I have ever bought! Will never buy another shaver again, unless I need a new Hydro Silk. But never another brand. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. BUT you can not use it dry, you will get razor burn. I used it dry and WHOA! it was pretty bad razor burn, so make sure you use water or some kind of mist. Overall it&#x27;s a great razor.</li>
    <li> i received this product from bzzagent. i tried it last night. i want to say  love it. its only the first time I&#x27;ve used it so I&#x27;m still hesitant but it feels so great on my skin. it glides over my legs. the trimmer is good too. it is a little bulky but over you get a nice trim and has different trim lengths. overall a great razor</li>
    <li> I got this razor in the mail for free from BZZagent. Normally I buy disposables and never will spend the money for a real razor because of the blade costs. HOWEVER...I LOVED the closeness of this shave. NO razor burn, (I use mens gel to cream with it)  I have had razor burn with the best of razors, but its been about 8 years since I went out and bought a good one. Glad times are changing. :) Im probably going to be buying refills for this one.</li>
    <li> Ultra smooth razor! Perfect find for the summer time :)  I&#x27;m still adjusting to the electric razor side but the sleekness and close shave of the manual side of the razor is enough for me to give this item 4 stars!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have what I consider coarse hair, so I&#x27;ve tried just about every razor under the sun; from electric to traditional razors. This razor left no hair behind. Another plus was that I was pretty quick when I used it the first time, I was on my way out and didn&#x27;t get any knicks or cuts. I&#x27;d definitely repurchase this or recommend it to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received a free product from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> Does exactly was it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives a clean shave using the razor and leaves your skin feeling so soft. The shave, I have found, usually lasts longer than the Venus razors that do not have the moisturizer built in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, personally, I think the trimmer could use some improvements. It&#x27;s really not made for any type of course hair. But, if you take the little trimmer attachment off and just use the electric razor, it gets pretty close and does a decent job for a razor so small. It definitely could use more power, but for what it is, it&#x27;s not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**received product for free to review from BzzAgent**</li>
    <li> I also received this product from bzzagent and was very impressed.far outshines other shick products. The adjustable comb and the moisture strip were my favorite things about it. My sensitive skin was without irritation or the red itchy bumps I normally get from shaving. Very pleased with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this product free thanks to BzzAgent! I have to say I give this 5 stars because I shaved my legs with just water and this razor and my legs are silky smooth and hydrated! This razor also doesn&#x27;t leave red bumps all over my legs. I can even go a few extra days without shaving. This is defiantly the best razor I have ever used and the trimmer side works very well too! It is convienant 2-1 and very easy to use! This razor is a must have!! #GotItFree</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! Great smooth shave with this razor, and I love the bikini trimmer it has on the end! Def a must-have for summer!</li>
    <li> if you use a trimmer a lot this is perfect!  the batteries don&#x27;t last long and I wish the handle was contoured for the trimmer side. but it worked well. the razor is where the magic happens. you will be checking to see if it is cutting the hair because it glides effortlessly. no shave cream needed ( I do not recommend any at all) this is amazing and I love it. thank you for allowing me to try it free and review this item for you BuzzAgent</li>
    <li> Love this razor and the fact that it has the trimmer 2-1 attached to the back handle. The moisturizer makes this really easy to use, you barely even need any shaving cream. The trimmer is great because it has 4 different levels - you can even take the white part off for a really close shave. Just watch out because I keep accidentally hitting the On button for the trimmer while I&#x27;m using the razor end - the button is right in the middle where your fingers go when holding it. I tried this free thanks to Schick.</li>
    <li> it came out pretty good and i&#x27;m not complaining, first couple of tries it was not fully working for me but then it did ! the razor side glides smoothly no nicks and cuts which i always tend to get.  Bzzagent sent me this product free for and absolute review. Love the widget came with a battery in the box which is a big plus and i cant complain there. Easy to wash after use love that it is waterproof protected. the closest trim is how i like it no irritation i used it with the skinmate shaving cream works good and legs weren&#x27;t left dry nor nicks and cuts. its a good try i&#x27;m not saying it works like crazy it took me a few attempts to get the hang of it and shaving patience with the machine remember you should be in no rush when shaving. No irritation nothing leave legs smooth not dry and ut works great i dont last forever shaving anymore</li>
    <li> I received this free in the mail from bzzagent. My opinion of this trimmer and razor is this. I love the color! Easy to install battery you just twist it in the middle. I love having the razor on one side and the trimmer on the other side it&#x27;s so convenient. The razor is amazing at first I thought it was a little bulky, but once I started using it it was perfect. It glided along my skin like it was butter. But the trimmer needs a lot of work. It&#x27;s hard to handle, and doesn&#x27;t cut the hair very well.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite razor, in fact it&#x27;s the only razor I&#x27;ve used for the past 5 years. I normally get the regular shick trimstyle from Walmart. I love the 5 bladed shick razors and the swivel head. They make for a close shave with out the worry of nicking yourself in awkward places (aka around your knee).  The trimmer on the other end is perfect for women who don&#x27;t like to wax but still want to be groomed, if you know what I mean. It comes with the plastic attachment so you can choose your length, similar to what barbers use. I personally take it off for a close shave. I&#x27;ve been had any problems using. I use to get ingrown hairs all the time when I would just use a razor down there. But ever since switching to the trimmer I never get any ingrown hairs.  Probably the main reason I&#x27;ve been using it for over 4 years now.</li>
    <li> I got this because I really needed a new bikini trimmer. I bought one some time ago, and it did a great job but it just ran its course. I read the reviews for this and this seemed to be the way to go. It really does a great job and I&#x27;m glad that I got it. The only downside about this razor is that it is pretty loud. Not that I&#x27;m trying to hide anything in the shower but, it really is much louder than my other bikini trimmer. But I do love that it is waterproof and you really cannot go wrong with the price.</li>
    <li> The razor blade felt very almost full like</li>
    <li> The commercial sells it much better than the actual product. The bikini trimmer doesn&#x27;t really do much or work as well as I was expecting</li>
