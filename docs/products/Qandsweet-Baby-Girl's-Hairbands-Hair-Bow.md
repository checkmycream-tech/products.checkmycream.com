      <li>i ordered for my four month old and they fit great.</li>
      <li>Very cute headbands, but they are for older babies, I&#x27;d say</li>
      <li>The bands are huge on my newborn even though her head is in the 98 percentile.</li>
      <li>Just right!  </li>
      <li>Way better than the annoyingly huge flower headbands :) The quality will definitely outlast the size.</li>
      <li>Better than buying individually on Etsy :)</li>
      <li>They fit perfectly on my 3 month old daughter&#x27;s head WITHOUT leaving the marks that other bows leave!!!  </li>
      <li>and we have gotten so many compliments so far!</li>

      <li>Shipping unbelievably fast !</li>
      <li>These headbands are soft and comfortable for your baby&#x27;s head.</li>
      <li>Lovely colors to choose from to match with different outfits.</li>
      <li>Made well with quality material, but fit my 5 month olds just a tiny bit snug.</li>
      <li>The bow is smaller than I expected but very cute.</li>
      <li>They are ok, one of the bows came off after only 2 wears, my baby is only 6 weeks</li>
      <li>These are highly comparable to the carter&#x27;s brand.</li>
      <li>I love the bows for my little angel</li>
      <li>After doing much research and reading all of the reviews it was clear that this product stood out among the rest.  </li>
      <li>The bow is not big and is just the right size for my nine month old.  </li>
      <li>The bow does come off, be prepared to hot glue it back.</li>
      <li>Not tight not to big.</li>

<li> She doesn&#x27;t seem uncomfortable but after a while she definitely has an indent.</li>
<li> The bow can be worn with fancy or casual outfits and the size of the bow is not too big or small.</li>

    <li> Very cute headbands, but they are for older babies, I&#x27;d say 6 months plus. The bands are huge on my newborn even though her head is in the 98 percentile.</li>
    <li> They are good and match outfits well</li>
    <li> What I needed. Not too big, not too small. Wish they had more colors because I would have bought more.</li>
    <li> They are just as pictured but better...price and shipping was awsome! Loved that it has a variety of colors.</li>
    <li> The bow is smaller than I expected but very cute.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE!! You can&#x27;t beat this price, quick shipping, and they look adorable!</li>
    <li> My daughter gets ton of compliment with lovely head band&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Very nice bright colors but the bows do not stick well to the headbands.</li>
    <li> LOVE these bows! They are well-made, good quality, fit perfectly &amp; great color selection. I have recommended them to several friends already!</li>
    <li> They are so cute! Made well with quality material, but fit my 5 month olds just a tiny bit snug. Way better than the annoyingly huge flower headbands :) The quality will definitely outlast the size. I wish I would&#x27;ve bought them months ago!</li>
    <li> These are great quality and the perfect size. We reach for these over our boutique bows.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite headbands for my daughter. The bow can be worn with fancy or casual outfits and the size of the bow is not too big or small. Just right!  The band is a little tight on my 4 month old&#x27;s head but she has a really really big head! She doesn&#x27;t seem uncomfortable but after a while she definitely has an indent. I just give it a nice good stretch before putting on and then it is fine. Should fit a normal sized 3-12 month old fine.</li>
    <li> Love bought at birth and still using and she&#x27;s almost 2!</li>
    <li> Very cute, i love the variety of colors. Now my baby has a bow to match every outfit</li>
    <li> Cute cute CUTE!  I absolutely love these bows!  They fit perfectly on my 3 month old daughter&#x27;s head WITHOUT leaving the marks that other bows leave!!!  I&#x27;m very impressed and we have gotten so many compliments so far!</li>
    <li> Shipping unbelievably fast ! Great products!</li>
    <li> Loved these! They were for my 4 month old babygirl &amp; fit perfectly! Not tight not to big. &amp; they have a nice clean cute look :)</li>
    <li> They are ok, one of the bows came off after only 2 wears, my baby is only 6 weeks so she wasn&#x27;t tugging on it or anything.. And they aren&#x27;t all the same size.</li>
    <li> These headbands are soft and comfortable for your baby&#x27;s head. Lovely colors to choose from to match with different outfits. The bow is not big and is just the right size for my nine month old.  These are highly comparable to the carter&#x27;s brand. Since I could not find an array of colors in carter&#x27;s I decided to try this brand and I&#x27;m so glad I did. After doing much research and reading all of the reviews it was clear that this product stood out among the rest.  If you want to purchase a very soft headband for your little princess I suggest you add this to your cart.</li>
    <li> No complaints here! Love these bows.</li>
    <li> beautiful! nice assortment in colors. the band stretches perfectly for multi age wear. i ordered for my four month old and they fit great.</li>
    <li> wonderful, they fit and look amazing!</li>
    <li> Love these! Use one every day!</li>
    <li> Good fit. The bow does come off, be prepared to hot glue it back. Better than buying individually on Etsy :)</li>
    <li> I love the bows for my little angel</li>
