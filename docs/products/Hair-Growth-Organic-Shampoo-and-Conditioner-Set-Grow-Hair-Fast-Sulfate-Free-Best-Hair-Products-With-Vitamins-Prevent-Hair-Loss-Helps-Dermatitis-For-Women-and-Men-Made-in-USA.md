      <li>so of course there will be more cancer because it is one of the ways that the body breaks-down and begins to malfunction.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never found a better shampoo and conditioner  - salon or store bought.</li>
      <li>What I love about them is that they are sulfate free and</li>

      <li>, I have never used a chemical free shampoo or conditioner.  </li>
      <li>, immediately I felt it softly, smooth, shine and some people noticed the difference.</li>
      <li>People are getting cancer for a number of reasons - PRIMARILY OUR S</li>
      <li>I noticed an immediate change after the first use and it just keeps getting better.  </li>
      <li>While these product would be good for occasional use to remove build up, my hair type would not allow it to be used every day.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s too early to know if it will be effective.  </li>
      <li>Along with keeping my hair nice and soft.</li>
      <li>leaves the hair soft and your hands to im loving</li>
      <li>After the very first was my hair seemed softer.</li>
      <li>Very pleased to have finally found products that work.</li>
      <li>While this worked fine as a shampoo and conditioner, it really did nothing for my hair that either added volume or inspired growth.  </li>
      <li>It was not terrible, but definitely a bit more tangly than normal, which is why I gave this 4 stars.</li>
      <li>They are super gentle on the hair but still cleaned my hair.</li>
      <li>In fact, the first couple times I used the conditioner I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed thinking it was not coming out until I noticed</li>
      <li>You get a better price and it will last you longer.</li>
      <li>, it just made my hair SUPER soft!</li>
      <li>I was a but taken aback the first time I tried it because it does not seem to lather as normal shampoos do.</li>
      <li>This is what I really wanted in a shampoo and conditioner since I wanted to stay away from all the others with those chemicals.</li>
      <li>I really hope this helps my hair grow out</li>
      <li>and they lather up very well</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks again</li>
      <li>It is true you really do not need to use very much.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to know if my hair has grown, but I have noticed a different on how clean and healthy my hair looks.</li>
      <li>I have been trying to grow my hair for the past year and since it grows at a snail&#x27;s pace, I was excited when I was given the opportunity to purchase this duo at a special price to test for quality.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to everybody.</li>
      <li>I bought this product for the natural ingredients and to help with an irritated scalp - had seen in other reviews that it was color safe.  </li>
      <li>Other changes that I&#x27;ve noticed is that my hair is strong, full, soft and actually pliable.  </li>
      <li>I want to say THANKS to the creators of this products; I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this all my life until now, I&#x27;ve just used one time so far</li>
      <li>Makes my hair while wet super tangly but after its dried my hair is shiny and soft :)</li>
      <li>I was so pleasantly surprised with this product!</li>
      <li>- People are living LONGER than ever before, most people in the 1930&#x27;s through the 1970&#x27;s barely lived past their 50&#x27;s now they are living until their 70&#x27;s</li>
      <li>all natural no parabens or artificial ingredients that are harmful to us is great.</li>
      <li>Once I use both the shampoo and conditioner, my hair is transformed into soft, shiny, and silky hair.</li>
      <li>and I want to say that my hair changed completely</li>
      <li>It is a family trait that I have sadly, most likely passed on to my own girls. :(</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way too, so I&#x27;m very excited to see my hair by the end of summer.</li>
      <li>I get what its trying to do but it very heavy using both on fine hair.</li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner set is a remarkable - I am almost afraid to use anything else now.  </li>
      <li>Brushing it out after my shower was a little discouraging because it did not have the detangling effect most other conditioners do.</li>
      <li>I generally use Biolage that I get from the salon</li>
      <li>ingredients was enough to make me steer clear of this product.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to grow their hair and help with other hair issues.</li>
      <li>I have used a lot of other shampoos and conditioners (from cheap to high priced) but this seems to be a winner, at least for me, in my book.</li>

<li> According to everyone wanting to push their expensive \\&quot;free-of-everything-including-common-sense\\&quot; product, All Shampoos, Conditioners and all other cosmetics contain &#x27;cancer-causing&#x27; ingredients despite the fact that these same ingredients have been used since the 1940&#x27;s with little to no actual evidence that they really do cause cancer except for some very &#x27;sketchy&#x27; so-called independent labs.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not worth the money! Left hair greasy &amp; flat!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has helped my hair grow when it would not before. It was above my shoulder before and now within sometime it is at my shoulders. Also, it has helped with my dry scalp issue. Along with keeping my hair nice and soft. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to grow their hair and help with other hair issues.</li>
    <li> At this time do not have any problems with my products that I ordered. thank you.</li>
    <li> I get what its trying to do but it very heavy using both on fine hair.</li>
    <li> Great stuff especially the conditioner.</li>
    <li> This for me ,is a magic elixir. At the end of one week of using the products I could tell the difference. My hair grew and felt thicker. I will continue to use it and am delighted with the results. It is true you really do not need to use very much. Very pleased to have finally found products that work.</li>
    <li> What a pant-load of B.S.!! Just the misinformation on the site about &#x27;Cancer Causing&#x27; ingredients was enough to make me steer clear of this product. According to everyone wanting to push their expensive \\&quot;free-of-everything-including-common-sense\\&quot; product, All Shampoos, Conditioners and all other cosmetics contain &#x27;cancer-causing&#x27; ingredients despite the fact that these same ingredients have been used since the 1940&#x27;s with little to no actual evidence that they really do cause cancer except for some very &#x27;sketchy&#x27; so-called independent labs. And a &#x27;grain&#x27; of truth mixed with a  &#x27;pound&#x27; of misinformation about all the sulfate products and preservatives. People are getting cancer for a number of reasons - PRIMARILY OUR S***** DIETS and lack of exercise, environmental factors (Stress, Air Pollution, Electromagnetic Pollution,) coupled with longer life spans - People are living LONGER than ever before, most people in the 1930&#x27;s through the 1970&#x27;s barely lived past their 50&#x27;s now they are living until their 70&#x27;s to 90&#x27;s that&#x27;s almost double so of course there will be more cancer because it is one of the ways that the body breaks-down and begins to malfunction.</li>
    <li> I want to say THANKS to the creators of this products; I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this all my life until now, I&#x27;ve just used one time so far and I want to say that my hair changed completely, immediately I felt it softly, smooth, shine and some people noticed the difference. I highly recommend it to everybody. If you want to experience the samething that I do now with my hair please buy this set of shampoo and conditioner and you won&#x27;t regret it. I have gray hair, too thin, and without life, I tried everything, all those famous products that you can find today, but finally I found what I was looking for, Thanks DERMA CHANGE because you made the best hair products ever, and I don&#x27;t have to keep  looking for anymore because I&#x27;m going to use this always. I also want to say that this products are very good for children and babies and all the family. Thanks again DERMA CHANGE you are the best!!! God Bless you. Go forward!.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shampoo and conditioner for anyone that wants to have great looking hair. What I love about them is that they are sulfate free and ph balanced. I have used a lot of other shampoos and conditioners (from cheap to high priced) but this seems to be a winner, at least for me, in my book. This shampoo and conditioner help to lock in the moisture in your hair and they smell wonderful. The conditioner is like silk. It is so easy to run it through your hair. The Manuka honey and the rest of the organic ingredients are great. I don&#x27;t have an itchy scalp anymore and I have noticed less shedding. This is what I really wanted in a shampoo and conditioner since I wanted to stay away from all the others with those chemicals. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I would recommend getting the bigger sized bottles ($84.99 for 16 oz set vs. $49.99 for 8 oz set). You get a better price and it will last you longer.</li>
    <li> While this worked fine as a shampoo and conditioner, it really did nothing for my hair that either added volume or inspired growth.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you are looking for thicker or longer hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! It has changed my hair in just a few days. I had frizzy hair in the back from medications and hair dye. I get my hair trimmed often, but it is damaged by medications. Once I use both the shampoo and conditioner, my hair is transformed into soft, shiny, and silky hair. It takes away the look of my damaged hair I don&#x27;t have to use a hair serum or hair oil now.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product to help grow my hair out for my wedding. I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to know if my hair has grown, but I have noticed a different on how clean and healthy my hair looks. I really hope this helps my hair grow out like I think it will. Watch my product review on Amazon http://youtu.be/608yG3c2WLM</li>
    <li> Not only do I lose alot of hair but my hair is at a point where it just will not grow anymore. It has been this length for years and no matter what I try. This shampoo and conditioner have been great. I have noticed a difference in the thickness and fullness of my hair. I have seen way less fallout. I love that these are organic! They are super gentle on the hair but still cleaned my hair. I did not notice any growth since using but I will continue use and update! *sample provided to review.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product if you color your hair.  I bought this product for the natural ingredients and to help with an irritated scalp - had seen in other reviews that it was color safe.  It made my hair look great the first couple of uses and my scalp felt less irritated, but then my hair started looking really dull, greasy, and it very evidently had faded my recent hair color (where with other products my hair color would last a very long time).  I still use this once in a while to help with my scalp irritation, but cannot use it on a regular basis.  Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> it is an awesome product as described...on my first application and showed very promising result!&lt;br /&gt;shipped and delivered prompytly</li>
    <li> Makes my hair while wet super tangly but after its dried my hair is shiny and soft :)</li>
    <li> I was searching for a sulfate free shampoo &amp; conditioner ever since I gave birth to my son 7years ago. My hair was thinning and coming out by the handful. Dr advised it could be low iron and the added testosterone in my system. I tried everything and nothing seemed to work, until I came across this product. After the very first was my hair seemed softer. It&#x27;s been several weeks and the hair loss has reversed and hair is filling in that was bald. A little goes a long way too, so I&#x27;m very excited to see my hair by the end of summer.</li>
    <li> The amount is 4oz per bottle.  It is literally a sample size for a product.  It is very expensive for the amount you get.  I have used it for only a few days, so it&#x27;s too early to know if it will be effective.  However, due to the cost, this will not be a product I will purchase again... It cannot be maintained ...</li>
    <li> Manuka Honey is like the absolute best honey to use, so to have this in my shampoo and conditioner is just awesome all natural no parabens or artificial ingredients that are harmful to us is great. these smell really good and they lather up very well leaves the hair soft and your hands to im loving this cant wait to get the bigger sizes and have my family use these as well, I love natural products and this seller really did a great job offering these at such a great price I am so happy to be able to leave a great review</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner set is a remarkable - I am almost afraid to use anything else now.  Previously I had horribly thinning, dry and brittle hair.  I noticed an immediate change after the first use and it just keeps getting better.  My fall out has reduced by at least 2/3rds and my hair is growing in (sadly its gray but I&#x27;ll take anything).  Other changes that I&#x27;ve noticed is that my hair is strong, full, soft and actually pliable.  It immediately leaves the scalp feeling like your skin can breathe.  I&#x27;ve never found a better shampoo and conditioner  - salon or store bought.</li>
    <li> My hair feels thicker than it has in a long time.  Small bottles are a tad pricey, but they seem to have worked!</li>
    <li> I have been trying to grow my hair for the past year and since it grows at a snail&#x27;s pace, I was excited when I was given the opportunity to purchase this duo at a special price to test for quality.  I have to admit, I have never used a chemical free shampoo or conditioner.  I generally use Biolage that I get from the salon so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a citrus scent and did not lather at all which I expected since it was all natural.  After using this shampoo, my hair felt like I had just used a clarifying shampoo on it.  Clarifying shampoos remove all the build up from various hair products you use.  The condition was extremely thick and had an aroma like leather.  I put it on my hair and left it there for about 5 minutes while I showered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use Argon oil on my wet hair to prevent split ends.  I blow dried my hair and it had tons of volume but looked fuzzy to me.  I had to add additional oil to my hair to tame it down.  While these product would be good for occasional use to remove build up, my hair type would not allow it to be used every day.</li>
    <li> I am a woman who suffers from the male pattern baldness. It is a family trait that I have sadly, most likely passed on to my own girls. :( There is nothing as frustrating as thinning hair! I am so worried about the appearance of my hair and usually wear it up to hide the thinning. Recently I was given the opportunity to try the Manuka Honey shampoo and conditioner and of course I will try anything to help! I was so pleasantly surprised with this product! I was a but taken aback the first time I tried it because it does not seem to lather as normal shampoos do. In fact, it feels a lot thicker. It is not any harder to rinse out, however. The conditioner was like velvety feeling. In fact, the first couple times I used the conditioner I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed thinking it was not coming out until I noticed, it just made my hair SUPER soft! Brushing it out after my shower was a little discouraging because it did not have the detangling effect most other conditioners do. It was not terrible, but definitely a bit more tangly than normal, which is why I gave this 4 stars. However, after my hair dried, I did notice less tangles throughout the day. My hair is noticeably softer! After a few uses, I also began to notice the individual hairs do appear thicker. Overall, I am VERY pleased and hope that this gem will even help regrow some of the hair I have lost!</li>
