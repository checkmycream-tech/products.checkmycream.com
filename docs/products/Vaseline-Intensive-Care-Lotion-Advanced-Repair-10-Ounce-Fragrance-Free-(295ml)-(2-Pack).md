<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got this lotion in the mail threw Influenster to try and test. I have used it over 5 days and have seen some nice improvement. I mainly used it on my hands since that were my biggest issue is. My hands were very dry and cracked. Since using this there not so rough and the cracks are almost all gone. It is also not so greasy compared to other lotions. Also since it fragrance free it doesn&#x27;t clash with whatever perfume I put on.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best lotions I have tried. My hands always get dry and flaky when the weather gets cold, and so far, my hands are still soft and smooth. It&#x27;s fast absorbing, non-greasy and works amazingly fast! It&#x27;s also great for those with sensitive skin, like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Product received free from influencer for testing and reviewing purposes ** And completely sold!</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion now for about 2 weeks. When I received this lotion, my hands were dry/cracked/and painful. I had been using another lotion (store brand, scented) and although it had held off the dry skin for a little bit, it just wasn&#x27;t any match for the wyoming Fall season and my skin started drying up like crazy. After receiving this lotion, I&#x27;m completely in love with. It absorbs well and does not leave my skin feeling greasy. After just one use, my skin already felt better. After a few days, my skin was almost completely healed, and after 5 days, my hands looked amazing. The scent-free is not an unpleasant glue-like smell you get with some scent-free products, but it is quite pleasantly plain. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I highly recommend this lotion for anybody suffering with dry skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of this lotion for free in exchange for my review (from Influenster). Regardless, the opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion.  I got this free to test through Influenster.  I generally prefer lotions with a fragrance.  But, I did notice that since it was fragrance free, it did not seem to be as irritating.  For example, I have sensitive skin.  When I shave my legs, pretty much every lotion burns or even creates some irritation.  But, this lotion didn&#x27;t.  It felt smooth and soothing.  It&#x27;s also been really nice to use on my dry heels, and even the scars from my recent surgery.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, I got it from Influenster to try out. I have had horrible dry skin on my hands and elbows due to freezing cold weather and this has been my life saver. I use it throughout the day to fend off the dry skin. I love the that this is fragrance free because I work closely with people and not everyone enjoys perfumed lotion.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and this product is absolutely for me. With the harsh winter seasons setting in I was looking for something gentle yet effective.. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have always suffered from dry skin especially in the winter. I started using this lotion twice a day any my skin is feeling and looking better than ever. It is gentle yet very effective. I would recommend this lotion for anyone who has mild to severe dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great lotion got it from influenster to try out its definitely on dry skin.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary bottle of Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair Fragrance Free lotion from Influenster for testing and review purposes. I had been looking for a good lotion because I live in the upper midwest and it gets COLD here in the winter, and my hands get very dry and they crack and bleed. It&#x27;s not fun. I was so happy Influenster chose me to review this product! I now know that I will never be without it! It is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used on my hands. A lot of lotions feel greasy on my hands, but this doesn&#x27;t. I also love that it&#x27;s fragrance free. It&#x27;s clinically proven to heal very dry skin in 5 days but I felt it working right away. I love the way it makes my skin feel. It&#x27;s so soft after I apply it! My husband has even started using it. I will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> Loved that this was fragrance free - and really fragrance free, not just a light scent. In fact, i was able to add my own essential oils to make unique lotion for the day - it was great. Worked great living in the cold Minnesota winter</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion, especially for winter skin. Myself and my kids all get itchy dry skin in the winter. This lotion is a godsend. It&#x27;s not greasy or too thick and absorbs quickly with no residue. I reccomend this to anyone who wants hydrated skin any time of year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*this was sent to me complimentary by influenster to review, but my review are my own thoughts and feelings about this product and are 100% honest.</li>
    <li> I was sent this lotion by Influenster and asked to do a review. I used it a few times. It wasn&#x27;t anything special compared to other lotions I&#x27;ve used in the past. My hands get really dry in the winter and this lotion didn&#x27;t seem to stay on after washing my hands just once, had to keep reapplying. Not sure I&#x27;d purchase once this bottle is used up. I do like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
    <li> I received this lotion free from influenster and I really liked it. I used it on my hands and my feet which are severely dry. After a few days I could really see a difference. My feet looked a lot better and I had no more hang nails on my hands. I like that it&#x27;s unscented and it doesn&#x27;t leave skin greasy. It&#x27;s a good lotion for very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I think this for free from Influenster for testing purposes. I&#x27;ve tried vaseline products in the past and was impressed as I am with this product. Even though it is fragrance free I think it has a nice scent. I like that its fragrance free because my son can use it without being embarrassed by a girly scent and I can also use it on my face. It is excellent on my dry skin. It feels silky on my hands.</li>
    <li> Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair Fragrance Free is amazing lotion !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this lotion complimentary from Influenster to test and review, I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about  2 week and I saw the difference my  skin feel soft and moisturized.When I received this lotion, my body feel dry and now my skin completely change right away. I love the Vaseline  Intensive Care Advanced Repair Fragrance Free is amazing lotion. I really recommend ...</li>
    <li> I recived this product from influenster for testing. My daughter has Eczema and this has been helping her since recived in the couple of months. I will definitely be buying more once it&#x27;s all gone.</li>
    <li> I received this lotion from influenster for free to try  and review , I absolutely love this lotion,my skin is very dry specially on colder weather, this lotion is very moisterizing its not sticky at all ,and i love that its fragrance free , and absorbs quickly !! So gratefull i got to try this amazing product..</li>
    <li> I received this free from Influenster for testing and review. I love this lotion! Its super moisturizing super creamy and it really is fragrance free!!! I highly recommend this product and just a tip, put it on right when you get out of the shower</li>
    <li> Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair Lotion is a great lotion that really lasts.I love the creaminess of it and it is great for my rough and dry hands. I also use is after showering every day. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy but absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft and smooth. I&#x27;m going to be using this product a lot this winter since the cold weather really dries my skin out. I&#x27;m very happy with this lotion!&lt;br /&gt;I received it complimentary for review purposes from #Influenster #Vaseline</li>
    <li> I received the product free to review from Influenster and I loved it!  This lotion is non-greasy and long lasting.  Being in the midwest we have extreme cold.  I use it in the morning and by bedtime my skin is still moisturized and not itchy at all.</li>
    <li> Yes once I received  my lotion first I starred using the lotion on my kiddies. They always wanted it on their skin  saying their skin felt nice. Plus I took noticed to the texture of not being dry  nor ashy. No itching.  The more I applied to them their results were positive. After a while I started using  my vase line too on my body and I love it. No dry sensations. No flaky looking skin. No  itching. Just smooth and soft  none oily. Just great. I recommend you all to try and apply. Your skin won&#x27;t thirst again. Thumbs up</li>
    <li> I love this product! It makes my skin feel very moisturized but not heavy and grease like other lotions of its kind and there is no irritating scents! I would definitely recommend this during the these dry winter months</li>
    <li> Wonderful. I loved the results!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT! I am very picky about my lotions. I get seriously chapped skin, on my hands, during the winter. Around my fingers will bleed and my skin starts getting really ashy looking. It is not pretty. I have tried lotion after lotion, with nothing that really does the job I need it too. I am so glad that I got picked to do this review for Vaseline!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You can purchase Vaseline Intensive Care Lotion at so many places. Walmart and Walgreens being the major ones that I have seen it at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I do NOT have any cracks in my skin right now, my hands are fingers are healing nicely since I have used this lotion for 2 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;@Influenster @VaselineBrand #Vaseline and #contest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this lotion as a Influenster product to test and post my honest review</li>
    <li> I received this lotion as a free sample from Influenster to test and review. I really like this lotion it helps now that winter has set in it really helps with my dry skin. I like that it&#x27;s fragrance free that way everyone is the house can use it.</li>
    <li> Growing up my dad always used Vaseline Brand lotion.  Every time I use this bottle of lotion it reminds me of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for review and I must admit I&#x27;ve been spoiled. I have very dry cracked feet and my husband has been rubbing this lotion into my feet at night. It has made a significant difference. It does not leave my feet feeling oily or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fragrance free lotion but as is the case with almost all fragrance free products it does have a scent to it. However it is a very mild but pleasant smell that I like.</li>
    <li> love this lotion  its been helping great with my dry skin  I will have to keep  buying lotion finally found a lotion that will help with the dry skin on my face  its been working great since I got it from Influenster.com to try out  for free</li>
    <li> I just love Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair Lotion. My favorite part is that it is fragrance free! I would  buy this lotion over and over again!</li>
    <li> I received the Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair Lotion from Influencer. I recently had surgery on my foot. With my foot bandaged for 2 weeks, my toes were very dry. I used the Vaseline lotion &amp; it helped elevate the dry skin very quickly. I will, without hesitation buy this when my bottle runs out!!!</li>
    <li> I was given a complementary bottle of this lotion by Influencer. This is a great lotion that is wonderful for sensitive skin. It has a pleasant smell that is very light, so anyone can really use it. I use everyday during the dry winter days. I highly recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this lotion complimentary from Influenster and Vaseline to test and review, and - this stuff is pretty darn good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had my first son and I and everyone else have been constantly washing their hands because it is flu season. Well, I already have dry skin so lotion is absolutely necessary. I have tried very many different brands and type but so far this has been the best. It sits right on my kitchen sink for everyone to try. After I dry my hands I immediately put this on my hands and forearms. It really soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy after layer on me. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and it is still working great on our family. I like that it is fragrance free since my baby and I have sensitive skin. My only negative is I wish it was a thicker consistency. I guess I just may prefer creams to lotions!</li>
    <li> I received this through influenster for free and we love it!! Helps both our very dry skin!!</li>
    <li> I received this lotion for free through influenster for testing purposes, but I&#x27;d totally buy it on my own (and I will when my bottle runs out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about a week now and have noticed that my skin feels more moisturized. I suspect that would be similar to most lotions on the market though. The thing I love about this lotion is that it is neither too thin nor too heavy for everyday use. I wash my hands a lot and need something that I can use frequently without feeling like I&#x27;m forever rubbing lotion in, and this does the trick! It absorbs quickly, and it keeps my hands feeling soft and moisturized even through all those hand washings.&lt;br /&gt; Vaseline is a brand that I trust, and I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good everyday lotion.</li>
    <li> I received this product to review by Influenster. However, the review and my opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am someone who uses lotion every day. I love quality and unscented lotion- so this was a perfect fit! The lotion is super smooth and does not have a strong odor. It does take a few minutes to set in (so don&#x27;t try to put tight jeans on right away!), but it does return to normal. Overall though, I noticed that my skin does not feel as dry when you use this product consistently. Especially with the weather getting colder and my skin getting dryer, this product has been really great to have around! I rated this as 4 out of 5 stars because I have used another lotion that is thicker and helps slightly better with dry skin. However, if you want a great everyday product that goes on smoothly and keeps your skin from getting too dry, then I would definitely recommend this one!</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well. It keeps my skin feeling hydrated throughout the day especially during the dry cold weather.</li>
    <li> I got this product free from Influenster for testing/review purposes. My skin is so dry in the winter weather, I have to be faithful about putting lotion on. This r Vaseline® Intensive Care™ Advanced Repair lotion seems to be helping, although it is a little thin for my liking and is a bit greasy right away. I will finish the bottle but will probably not buy another.</li>
    <li> Got this free from Influenster, and its good! Its not greasy at all and it moisturizes. I think its best used after a shower or if your skin has been wet.</li>
    <li> I received this box for free through Influenster for the purpose of testing and reviewing. I was not entirely impressed with this product. The product is fragrant free yet it has a slight chemical/plastic smell. The formula wasn&#x27;t greasy and was absorbed quickly however I didn&#x27;t see a big difference after five days. I put it on my hand and elbows every morning and night and I could not see any improvement. It&#x27;s an average product but for the price I would not buy it.</li>
    <li> I received this lotion complimentary from Influenster for testing and reviewing purposes only. Every thing I am about to write is true and 100% my own feelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is great! I did the 5 day challenge and noticed a big difference in my skin. I was very skeptical when I first tubbed it in my skin because it seemed watery but after it&#x27;s all rubbed in my skin was left feeling silky. After getting hardwood floors my feet have become super dry and this stuff has been magic for them. I love this stuff. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I do wish it was thicker. But it really doesn&#x27;t effect the way it works at all.</li>
    <li> I recieved this lotion complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I didn&#x27;t think that a lotion could make such a big difference in my skin, but it has. Even just after a few days of me first using it, it works amazing. I already went and bought a bottle to replace my almost gone bottle. I&#x27;d definitely give it a try!</li>
    <li> I received this lotion complimentary of influenster . I started out with extremely dry skin , ya know the skin that is itchy and scaly , kinda of reptile like . I tried this lotion and within 5 to 6 days my skin had did a total turn around . My skin is now healthy looking and no longer itches , and I thank vaseline intensive care advanced repair .</li>
    <li> I was given by Influenster to review a bottle of Vaseline Intensive Care advanced repair Lotion(10 oz.) It came with 2 test strips to do a before and after comparison of how dry my skin was before and another strip for the after I used the lotion for 5 days, that was the challenge. I have very, very dry skin especially in the winter months so I used the first strip and it showed how dry I was. The Vaseline advanced repair with glycerin and droplets of petroleum jelly was going to be put to the test. It was immediately very soothing and moisturizing to my skin so for 5 days I used only this lotion, I absolutely loved it. I could see the difference on my very dark skin. The ash and the scaliness was gone. After the 5 days were up I did the 2nd strip and it showed that my skin had moisture. It was a 10 oz. bottle and I used it until it was all gone! I purchased 2 more and this is my winter staple. Oh yes let me mention that it is moisturizing but non-greasy also it has no smell and that is important because I love to wear fragrances and the lotion does not interfere with that. I love it and I thank Influenster and Vaseline for allowing me to test it for free and give my honest opinion about this product. I am going to continue to purchase this I am a fan!!</li>
    <li> It worked but not as much as I had hoped. It had that &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; smell which wasn&#x27;t aweful, but it was really thin and seemed to evaporate quickly. I&#x27;ll keep using it but I probably won&#x27;t buy more</li>
    <li> I like how it repaired my skin and was till not greasy. The scent was light and mild enough for my husband.</li>
    <li> In the past I have not been able to use any of Vaseline lotions either because they caused me to break out or they just didn&#x27;t work. The new Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair Lotion not only was gentle enough that I could use it, but it actually made my skin feel soft. This lotion is quick to absorb after it is applied. The fragrance is natural which means every family member will be can use this without being offended by the scent. I am pleasantly surprise overall with this lotion and would recommend it to my family and friends.  I received this lotion complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and in no way did it influence my opinion.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I received this lotion free from Influenster, but all opinons are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a few days, and I definitely notice a difference in the moisture level of my skin.  It glides on smoothly and absorbs into my skin relatively fast.  I really like that it&#x27;s fragrance free, so I don&#x27;t end up smelling like I took a bath in potpourri.  The only negative so far is that it does seem a little greasy after the first few minutes of application, but once you let it dry a little there&#x27;s no residue or stickiness.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so great!! My boyfriend even uses it!! I will buy this any time I need lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this product i love vaseline in general but this works great for our sensitive skin and hydrates well. I did receive this product for review purposes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I was able to try out the new Vaseline intensive care lotion this year when this winter had been a lot dryer than the fall. My skin had been a lot softer and smoother than I&#x27;ve ever experienced so far and I will be repurchasing it. I have been given this product to test out and review for free by Influenster.</li>
    <li> I recently tried this lotion when I was sent a #Vaseline Voxbox from Influenster . I loved it. I received it right in time for the cold weather.With all the wind and cold my skin gets extremely dry and this worked without feeling greasy .</li>
    <li> I received this free from #Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s awesome. I love it. it works!. My skin is always super dry when the seasons are changing and in the winter so this came at the perfect time. It&#x27;s a good size bottle too. I just put it in my purse and am able to have it with me all the time.</li>
    <li> #vaseline Intensive Care is great! My hands are very dry and crack easily in the winter. This product helped those cracks and my dry hands. Love it! Thanks Vaseline and Influenster</li>
    <li> 100% best lotion ever used. I am a fan of tattoos ( I have multiple) so unscented lotion isn&#x27;t a stranger to me. with that being said my skin was like a dry sponge with this lotion ....until I put it on my skin (arms legs even my face) I wasn&#x27;t aware that It was even dry until I felt how soft it was afterwards. I received this in an influenster box but I will continue to buy it after I run out!</li>
    <li> I was given this lotion curtesy of Influenster to try it and give my reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im very happy with this product, during this time of the year, I get super dry scaley elbows, and cracked heals, Ive been using the lotion not only on my hands, but especially these two problem areas and the change is remarkable. Not only is there hardly any fragrance (for those that might be less tollerable) but the lotion goes on easily without rubbing for 5 minutes and then some, and your skin is silky smooth and soft afterwards and hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion does not leave any greasyness on your skin, nor does it rub off on clothing or furniture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall ive seen, is I do like a bit more fragrance to my lotions, however that is just me, those that dont like fragrances would really like this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend this to people</li>
    <li> I got to try this lotion for free from influenster to review it. It really has done a great job in hydrating my skin when it gets dry. I like how it soaks into my skin and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance so it is good with my sensitive skin. No on to the cons. I don&#x27;t like the ingredients list. For that reason I took off one star. I will continue to use it until the bottle is gone but I probably would not buy it. Some of the ingredients are okay but I am disappointed to see it contains parabens. Looking at the ingredients list I don&#x27;t see much of anything natural at all. That is definitely a disappointment. All in all the lotion does hydrate your skin and works pretty well.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin (dry as in the humidifier is constantly running in the winter) and I have been searching for a lotion that does not have a fragrance, isnt too oily, absorbs quickly, feels smooth and lasts all day.  Needless to say, I was searching for a lotion that didnt exist!  Then one day influenster sent me a survey and I was approved for the vox box.  I got my completely free bottle of lotion to try and review.  I am now a believer!  This lotion works great as an all over body lotion, especially straight out of the shower. Absorbs quickly so none of that annoying sticky pants thing in the morning, and even works on my excema!  I didnt care for it as a hand lotion but its my number 1 go-to for body lotion hands down!</li>
    <li> First off I received this lotion complimentary from Influenster to test and review, with that being said every word that I am about to write is true and 100% my own feelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fell in love with this almost instantly the second I put this cream on my extremely gross dried up wrinkly hands. The day I got this in the mail I put this on the table with the rest of the mail to open later. Proceeded to go about cleaning this house but not 5 minutes into cleaning I stopped. My hand that day had been worse than normal, chapped, dry flaky and just down right irritating. Put some Vaseline Intensive care advanced repair lotion and man did this stuff work quickly. I normally cant find anything that seems to work on my hand the way I would like. But man this stuff work wonders. I went from very dry skin to great looking moisturized in skin in under an hour. I even gave to my dad whose diabetic to use on his difficult areas and it worked wonders.</li>
    <li> I took the 5 day challenge, and I&#x27;m a believer! My hands start to dry out in the fall, so this came free in my mailbox to try at the perfect time.My hands are soft, smooth looking and feel healthier! I will be purchasing this when I run out of my sample.</li>
    <li> A lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave you with an oily feeling on your hands, it absorbs quickly and makes the areas that you put the lotion on very soft! I also received this product for free to test through Influenster, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I struggle to pay for a lotion that I know works and is worth what I pay for it. It&#x27;s not a lotion that works over night, but with good routine you will notice a difference after only a few days. I don&#x27;t struggle with bad dry skin, therefore I do not put the lotion on every day, but my skin is still smooth from when I did put it on which makes me feel that this is a lotion that is worth what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I received this lotion from influenster for testing purposes and I really liked it. The only downfall I had with it is it left my hands a little greasy after initially applying it. It has actually helped my dry hands and have helped my husbands excema as well. It seems to do the trick for us though</li>
    <li> i recieved Vaseline Intensive care lotion free to test from Influenster for an honest reveiw. let me start by saying i have eczema really bad during the fall and winter months and extremely dry skin. So i was very excited to try something new! Vaseline did not dissapoint! i put the lotion on all over after every shower and my skin feels very soft. my eczema has started to clear up better with this then with my eczema cream. i highly reccomend for people with not only dry skin but eczema too!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! I saw results the first time I used it. And my skin didn&#x27;t stay wet and greasy.  I love that it has no smell. And my smoothness lasted all day. I have been using this daily and see such a difference in my skin. Especially going into winter where my skin is dry, I&#x27;m very excited to have found this! And I cant believe I got it free to test from influenster!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I got a free sample bottle to test and review from  Influenster.  It was a terrific lotion, it went on smooth and didn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. I used it mostly on my hands and feet. It made them feel lots smoother and softer. My feet were so dry and cracked before i started using it, but now they are much better, almost healed up. I will continue to use this to get them all the way better.</li>
    <li> #Vasaline Voxbox I receiced this product through influenster. It really did work well. This is the first winter in a long time that I did not have dry cracking skin. I will definetly buy again.</li>
    <li> I received this lotion for free from influester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best lotions i have ever used. It absorbs quickly and leaves no residue i will purchase this one from mow on vs the cocoa butter lotion i use also by vaseline</li>
    <li> #Vaseline is the best lotion to put on my tattoo this winter! And keeps my legs moisturizer and soft!</li>
    <li> totally love #Vaseline intensive care lotion. i have really dry skin in the winter and since i started using this i would never of known i had dry skin. its not greasy it dries quick. i recommend this to anyone especially if u have dry skin</li>
    <li> I received this lotion via the Vaseline VoxBox through Influenster to try out for free.  It&#x27;s not my favorite lotion especially for winter, I tend to get much drier skin in winter and need something thicker and more moisturizing.  I think it will be really good for summer though when I need a lighter lotion!</li>
    <li> I love my vaseline intensive care, it&#x27;s perfect and by now my hands would be cracked and bleeding and they&#x27;re not.  It&#x27;s the best and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a few weeks - I got it free from Influenster to test and review. It&#x27;s light and creamy and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy on your skin. It&#x27;s unscented, which I normally wouldn&#x27;t buy, but I like it so much it doesn&#x27;t matter. My skin looks and feels so much better, and with a long winter ahead, I will definitely buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a full coverage lotion that went on without feeling weighed down or greasy. I could instantly feel relief in my hands, as they were very dry. However, over the course of the week, they were very smooth feeling, which is a difficult task to achieve in a Minnesota winter!</li>
    <li> I really love Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair Lotion in Fragrance Free!!  It really has helped clear up a lot of my dry skin problems.  I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if it was really fragrance free but it is!  I like that because I can add a light scent lotion or perfume and not feel like I am mixing smells and making my allergies worse or smelling like a perfume factory.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion really lives up to it&#x27;s name and I will continue to use this product and recommend it to friends!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free #Vaseline VoxBox</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough about Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair Fragrance Free lotion, but I will try to keep my remarks to an acceptable length.&lt;br /&gt;I am a member of Influenster and I was sent this product to try and review (completely free of charge). In the box with this product, I received a little tester to see if you actually have dry skin. The first step is to put this sticker-type thing on your skin and then peel it off, and it has different pictures that show exactly how dry your skin is. Then you use the lotion, then try the test again&lt;br /&gt;INSTANT DIFFERENCE! I was absolutely in love from that minute. I used it every day for 5 days straight to see if it really works in that short amount of time. I&#x27;m here to tell you; it does. I have that &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; on the backs of my arms (and it gets worse in the winter)...and this lotion has helped better than the super expensive lotions and creams that my dermatologist has prescribed.&lt;br /&gt;The only criticism I would have, if I were being nit-picky, is that for the first few minutes after you apply it (before that dry skin starts soaking it in) you feel a little greasy. It seriously only lasted a few minutes though.</li>
    <li> Great product - I am a lotion snob/hoarder/enthusiast.  This lotion is my go-to lotion, especially during these dry winter months when my skin is most dry.  It absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy which is hard to come by.  It also doesn&#x27;t have a scent which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like most about this lotion is it has the moisture component of a cream, without having the texture of a cream.  For example, before I go to bed I&#x27;ll slather creams on my face/hands/feet (see: lotion enthusiast).  This lotion has the same effect without the thick-creamy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I received this lotion complimentary from Influenster to test and review.  All opinions are 100% mine.</li>
    <li> I received the full size lotion for free from influenster. I actually like this lotion and I don&#x27;t like lotion at all. Usually I just let my skin be dry, crack, and bleed. But this lotion Dosent feel greasy or have a strong smell. It dosent take forever to absorb into my skin. I look moisturized and not like a dried up lake in the Sahara desert. So I would highly recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 5 weeks now my feet are not ruff anymore and my hands are smooth.# Vaseline #voxbox was my  skins life saver im smooth and sliky now and it all thanks to # Vaseline intensive care advance repair.I give this wonderful lotion a 5 star rating before I got my voxbox I had skin that would  bleed and cracked now I have skin that is wonderful. I received the product(s) complimentary to test and/or review.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders especially for me in the winter. If you are looking for a fast working Lotion, definitely try this out because ive seen results in just a couple of days. It feels nice because my skin feels moisturized and i would definitely recommend this to anyone that has dry skin because it Works! and it will work for you too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for a few weeks now. It has totally helped my skin stay hydrated. I love this lotion. It has made my skin less itchy and less dry. I got busy and skipped it a couple days and even then, it stayed well hydrated. It will be hard to go back to my old lotion after using this product. Well worth the buy is you ask me. A little goes a very long way. The only issue I would have with it would be how greasy it makes my hands feel after I use it. But that fades away fast. And I am like that with any lotion on my hands. A+ stuff.</li>
    <li> I received a free bottle of the Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair Lotion to test &amp; review from Influenster.  I&#x27;m not a big lotion person because I don&#x27;t like how many lotions leave you feeling greasy.  I have to say this lotion exceeded my expectations!  It&#x27;s not greasy at all!  I used it the first time on my dry elbows &amp; there was an IMMEDIATE noticeable difference.  I went to put more on the next day &amp; my elbow still was nice &amp; soft so a little goes a long way!  I&#x27;ve used it a few more times within the last few weeks all with the same great results!  With going into the winter months I will DEFINITELY be using more of this lotion &amp; am glad I was chosen to test this product.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes. However, the opinions stated here are my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this lotion right in time as the weather got colder and my skin got drier. My first thought was that I remembered I am not a huge fan of  fragrance-free lotions because ironically, to me, they have a funny scent to them. That definitely was not enough to keep my from trying the product though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After  using it once, it was a nice, thick consistency and wasn&#x27;t too watery when applying. I liked that my skin felt very moisturized right away. I have also noticed that my skin is now overall less dry with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue that I have with the lotion is that it did leave me feeling a bit greasy right after applying it. I have a feeling this is from those microscopic droplets of petroleum jelly in the lotion sitting on top of my skin. I usually apply lotion to my legs right before bed and I lie on my side so my legs felt sticky against each other for a while. I then tried using it in the morning when I get out of the shower instead and, alas, it made my pants difficult to put on. I think these droplets are what contribute to its long-lasting moisturizing properties so I would hate to lose that, but that&#x27;s the downfall I noticed with this. I&#x27;ve tried now to apply the lotion and then just walk around for a bit before getting dressed or lying down to let the lotion soak in and that has seemed to make a difference.</li>
    <li> I received this lotion from influenster. It is awesome. Even though it is a thicker lotion for dry skin it didn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or sweaty looking. It was really moisturizing. My mother suffers from dry skin mainly on her back, so I ended up giving this to her to try as well...she has been loving it so far, it has helped her a bunch with her skin! Great lotion!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s thick enough to moisturize your tough, dry skin. It dpest leave your skin feeling greasy or oily. Great product!</li>
    <li> I received this free in a VoxBox from influenster and I loved it. I have had dry skin my entire life, and winter makes it 20x worse. It&#x27;s not unusual for me to have cracked elbows and chapped hands this time of year, but this year I do not thanks to this lotion. It&#x27;s thick and creamy and really gives you the feeling of intense moisture. I put it on after I get out of the shower and I can tell the difference immediately. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got this product free from Influenster to try and I love it! I don&#x27;t use lotion that often but this is light enough that I don&#x27;t mind putting it on after a shower! I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent because I don&#x27;t like strong lotion and then I can also put on body spray or perfume. It is a tad bit oily but I expected that because of the fact that it is a vaseline product but it is not bad at all!! I recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like putting lotion on!!</li>
    <li> Just like other users, I received this products for free thanks to Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product could not have come at a better moment. With the temperatures going down (I live on the East Coast) and winter approaching, my skin gets really dry. I pretty much have to put body lotion on every day, sometimes even several times a day. The Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair Lotion was really perfect for me. First, it is fragrance free, which is ideal for my sensitive skin. Second, my skin absorbed the lotion very fast and did not feel sticky. Third, my skin remained hydrated until the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with dry and sensitive skin. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product so it lasts a long time. You also don&#x27;t need to wait for long before putting on your clothes. A great find I&#x27;ll buy again soon.</li>
    <li> I got this free from Influenster and it&#x27;s great. Not greasy, and moisturizes well! I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of lotions and I really like this one. However, my one complaint is that it is a bit watery. It takes a bit to be rubbed into skin, but it is great once it is! I tend to use it before I go to bed so that it can work its magic overnight.</li>
    <li> First off I received this lotion complimentary from Influenster to test and review, with that being said every word that I am about to write is true and 100% my own feelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is the bee&#x27;s knees!! I wish that I would have found it sooner than this but I am eternally grateful that I was chosen by influenster for this voxbox because after trying this, even the first time I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without using this lotion. I have not only used this product on my hands, but on my legs, and arms and even my feet (and everyday that I apply it to my feet they thank me).  For a lotion to make your hands soft and stay soft after only the first time you use it, I think that everyone should buy this and try it out because you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I also LOVE that even if you forget to put it on for one day that your hands don&#x27;t get all dry and scaly right away.  It keeps working even if you forget a day, and not to mention but my boyfriend sure does love that my hands are so soft, mine being so soft makes up for his being so rough.  Come winter months when he is off, I&#x27;m going to make sure that he uses this lotion too, so that he can have smooth not rough skin.  I have even used it on my dogs pads.  If you put just a little bit on and rub it in, it helps them during the winter months so that they don&#x27;t become all cracked and dry because of the dry air.&lt;br /&gt;I could honestly go on and on about this product and how wonderful it is and how well it works, but me saying this is one thing and trying the lotion out for yourself is another, so I suggest that you definitely go and buy a bottle and try it out for yourself and believe me you won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
    <li> I used this for the last week and made everyone try love light weight it feels no greasey. I don&#x27;t think I will ever be able to buy a different lotion. So try Vaseline® Intensive Care(tm) Advanced Repair Fragrance for five days. and see beautifully healed skin can be. See how moisturized your skin feels!&lt;br /&gt;@Influenster and @VaselineBrand in your post. Make sure to add the hashtag ‪#‎Vaseline‬, too! Disclosure that you received this product complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> On 10/27/2014, I received my first @Influenster box that contained @Vaselinebrand #vaseline intensive care advanced repair lotion/hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;Having horribly dry skin on my hands and feet (Due to Sarcoidosis &amp; Dyshidrotic eczema, I have tried just about every cream both over the counter &amp; by RX, with so so results.&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to say that after using it about 2-3xa day, it had healed the cracks and splits on both my hands and feet and best of all, it absorbs fast and No greasy hands/feet!!!&lt;br /&gt;My hand in this pic is red cause I just wanted dishes, not due to dry skin!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend #Vaselineintensivecare #advancedrepair.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you #Influenster for sending me this great product to try for #Free!!!</li>
    <li> First off I received this lotion complimentary from Influenster to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is the very effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad that I was chosen by influenster for this voxbox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not only used this product on my face and hands, but on my legs, arms, and feet. A week&#x27;s worth of face use showed no breakouts for me, and softer skin. I mostly use it on my feet though, as I find this lotion to smell very bad to me despite being &#x27;unscented.&#x27; It was hard for me to do the week long face test because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the results I saw, I&#x27;m excited to try the Aloe version! I checked it in store, and it smelled very nice :)</li>
    <li> Like I said it gets the job done. It&#x27;s not the most amazing lotion around and I don&#x27;t normally use lotions with petroleum jelly (I also try to avoid products that test on animals--Unilever does).&lt;br /&gt;But....It does work well. I got a 10oz bottle complimentary from Influenster for testing/review purposes, so I can&#x27;t complain about a free product too much!!&lt;br /&gt;it came with this cool &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; test. You take a strip and put it on a dry patch for 3 seconds and peel it off. It shows skin flakes if your skin is dry. 5 days later you do it again and compare results. After 5 days my skin certainly was less dry. I will definitely use it all up, since winter is coming. However, I won&#x27;t be purchasing a new bottle. If you are a an of Vaseline in general, then this lotion is definitely a great product for you. Plus it is fragrance free, is non-greasy and you only need a small amount to spread over large areas. Good cost for the amount you get. See my photo for my before and after comparison.</li>
    <li> i received this lotion free from influenster to test and review. i loved this lotion!! aside from a slight filmy feel after i applied it (i think i put it on to thick) its an amazing lotion. i used it after my shower for a few days and my skin is softer. what else i love is that is its fragrance free,which is awesome for someone who has a sensitivity to certain types of smells.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie. When influenster offered to let me review this product, I was skeptical. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of lotions anyway so this seemed unlikely to impress. With that being said.... Once you try this stuff, there will be no going bad to the thin, heavily perfumed immatators. This stuff sticks! And moisturizes unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever seen. So, a huge thanks to influenster.Com for allowing me to test this product for free. Vaseline now has a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I received this lotion free from Influenster to test and review.  I&#x27;ve been using it for month and overall i like it.  I tend to get dry skin on my arms, legs, and feet and rough, dry, difficult to exfoliate patches on my elbows and feet - especially during Winter.  This lotion has worked well at moisturizing and eliminating my dry skin on my arms, legs, and feet. And I discovered that it also is great at helping to exfoliate stubborn, rough, dry patches as well - I just moisten my skin, apply this lotion, let it soak in a few minutes, then exfoliate with a loofa.  A small amount of this lotion goes a long way, and one application a day keeps my skin nicely hydrated.  It leaves my skin looking and feeling soft, smooth, and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor dislike I have about this lotion is that it feels a little greasy while applying, but it absorbs in less than 5 minutes, so the slightly greasy feeling doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this to anyone with dry skin that&#x27;s in need of a good, hydrating lotion.&lt;br /&gt;And I will continue using up the rest of the lotion in the complimentary bottle I received, and it has now become one of several brands I will buy and use when its on sale or I have a coupon for it.</li>
    <li> I received this lotion for free through influenster for testing purposes, but I&#x27;d totally buy it on my own (and I will when my bottle runs out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about a week now and have noticed that my skin feels more moisturized. I suspect that would be similar to most lotions on the market though. The thing I love about this lotion is that it is neither too thin nor too heavy for everyday use. I wash my hands a lot and need something that I can use frequently without feeling like I&#x27;m forever rubbing lotion in, and this does the trick! It absorbs quickly, and it keeps my hands feeling soft and moisturized even through all those hand washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this is fragrance free, and I mean completely fragrance free. Even some &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; products will still smell strongly of soap and/or other smells. I can&#x27;t smell this at all! This is particularly important when you work around scent-sensitive people. My skin also tends to be sensitive and this hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all. Vaseline is a brand that I trust, and I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good everyday lotion.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. Its not greasy at all, and goes on smooth. Its not super thick like a body butter, but your skin retains thats moisture. I can feel how it has softened my hands, from just applying it elsewhere. My only dislike is the smell, it is fragrance free, but I&#x27;ve never liked its smell. Im sure thats weird, but I would like to see one that has a very soft scent, not an overwhelming powder scent, but understated. I look forward to see how it helps my skin over these next couple of winter months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, I received a free bottle for testing and review purposes from Influenster.</li>
    <li> Love it got mine free from influenster!! #vaseline! Great no greasy formula leaves skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I received this for testing purposes from influenster. I found that this product worked very well it makes my very dry winter skin very soft and smooth the only problem I really had with this product is it say it is non greasy but I found that it does feel slightly greasy to me but none the less this product was wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> My skin tends to get dry easily so moisturizing has long been a part of my routine. Now that the temperature is dropping, it’s only bound to get worse. Especially with the longer hot showers I&#x27;ve been taking! So I tried Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair lotion and I loved it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are why:&lt;br /&gt;+ It’s rich and thick yet it does not feel greasy at all&lt;br /&gt;+ Fragrance-free – Don’t get me wrong, I also like scented lotions. But I definitely don’t mind having an unscented one around for days when I just don’t feel like smelling like anything at all, or when I want to spray on some perfume and don’t have to worry that the scents will clash with each other.&lt;br /&gt;+ It really does make my skin feel hydrated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received the Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair lotion free for testing purposes from Influenster.</li>
    <li> #vasline&lt;br /&gt;I received this lotion from #influentser to test and it&#x27;s nice, goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad. But overall it&#x27;s just another lotion to me... I don&#x27;t find it is much different then other intensive lotions I have tried :( still dry skin</li>
    <li> I like the new Vaseline Intensive Care hand lotion.  I got it in the free voxbox from Influenster.  I have kept it by my nightstand since I got it in the mail a while ago.  I usually put it on before bed every night and I noticed a huge difference in my hands and how soft they are.  I have really dry skin in the winter and this lotion has helped keep my dry hands soft and smooth, I also have let my husband try it out for a while because he gets cracked skin as well in the winter.  He used the lotion for 5 days and his cracks cleared up!  I would recommend this product to anyone with dry hands.  I like how it makes my hands soft and its not too greasy.  I would buy this product again and I am grateful I relieved it in my voxbox from influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this was a free item, this review is 100% true and accurate and I would love to get it again and recommend to friends and family</li>
    <li> I have to say i got to test this through influenster (#vaseline voxbox). I have to say this product is amazing. When you are putting it on it makes your skin feel  like it can breath. And with it being fragrance free it doesn&#x27;t burn your skin. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has dry skin like i do. It definitely works.</li>
    <li> Receiving this product for free from Influenster was such a blessing!  I have notoriously dry skin, especially my elbows, and using this made such a difference!  My dry, flaky skin is smooth and soft again. I apply it every day after I shower, and sometimes a second time before bed. It has earned it&#x27;s way into my daily routine for sure.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest I&#x27;ve used. It leaves my skin feeling greasy and sticky!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Vaseline Intensive Care lotion. It is so moisturizing and affordable. It works great leaving my skin looking and feeling healthy and hydrated! This lotion is also gentle on skin, and wont leave your skin feeling uncomfortable like other lotions can do.</li>
    <li> I got this from Influenster to test out. And we love it. My husband especially loves it! He works in the oil field and his hands get pretty beat up. He loves the fact that it isn&#x27;t scented like all of my fancy lotions!!!</li>
    <li> Received this lotion from Influenster and I absolutely love it. It works extremely well and will be my new go to fragrance free lotion. My skin has been extremely soft and stays moisturized all day when I use it in the morning.</li>
    <li> I got this product free to test and review. The Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair Lotion is amazing! I use it every single day and I have really noticed a difference. Although I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, my skin already feels much healthier and smoother. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a new lotion!</li>
    <li> Influenster sent me Vaseline‬ Intensive Car Advanced Repair for free to try and review, I decided to take the 5 Day Challenge (from the Vaseline commercial) and photograph my skin improvements!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from extremely dry skin and while there has been improvement, I wouldn&#x27;t call my skin &amp;#34;fully healed&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m not convinced a lotion exists that can fully cure my dry, cracked skin in just 5 days. However, my skin is less dry and less cracked after using this lotion for 5 days, so I will continue to use it and probably continue to improve! Winter is the worst time of year for my skin because we have the heat cranked up all the time and the air outside is dry too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is unscented so it doesn&#x27;t conflict with whatever scents I am already wearing for the day and as promised it is NOT oily. It is a good clean lotion and I enjoy it, even if it can&#x27;t magically cure my lizard skin completely.</li>
