      <li>I may consider upping my review to 5 stars if it looks nice as it</li>
      <li>The pic doesn&#x27;t really do it justice as the lighting conditions weren&#x27;t great when I took it, but I hope it helps anyway!</li>
      <li>and I honestly get it re-dyed probably every four to five months.  </li>
      <li>I love love love this brand of dye!!</li>
      <li>Fun and great color &#x3D; love it!</li>
      <li>No matter how many times I re-dyed my hair, I always had more at the bottom of the container!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair since I was 12,  Jerome Russell - punky color is by far the best and cheapest product I&#x27;ve ever used in my hair.</li>
      <li>Love the color and the smell was nice.</li>
      <li>It is by far THE BEST.</li>
      <li>She is super happy with it :)</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
      <li>If you want a lighter or bolder shade you&#x27;re going to have to lighten your hair first as per the instructions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am more than happy with it as it is.</li>
      <li>Bright and very pretty.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful vibrant color.</li>
      <li>It is my opinion that this color lasts the longest and fades out the prettiest of all the Punky Colour dyes I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried most of them.</li>
      <li>&amp;#60;3 :)</li>
      <li>Love this product,</li>
      <li>Is more like a fucsia</li>
      <li>This is a better product than &amp;#34;Splat&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Manic Panic&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Manic Panic fades with every wash, and this stuff is both cheaper and much more pigmented.</li>
      <li>i just wish i could find more colors online</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this color......</li>
      <li>I love this color.</li>
      <li>I love this brand.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite brand and lasts the longest.</li>
      <li>I tried every semi-permanent brand out there and all of them fade rather quickly, mostly 2 weeks top.</li>
      <li>Worked phenomenally, much better than manic panic and rivaled pravana&#x27;s staying power.</li>
      <li>and I love it :)</li>
      <li>A lot better then</li>
      <li>And it smells like grapes :)</li>
      <li>Magic? @.@</li>
      <li>Also, I decided to streak it, but under the top layer of hair, so it doesn&#x27;t complicate matters when I need to retouch my regrowth to cover my grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but okay</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
      <li>I also have the violet dye and love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love, love, love...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve just used this product to give myself a pink streak, having never given myself any kind of highlights/lowlights or used a really bold dye before. My hair is naturally a medium-brown and I dye it regularly with a permanent &amp;#34;golden-brown&amp;#34; dye. I did not want to use a bleach or lightening product on my hair as I didn&#x27;t want to damage it. This meant that when I used the punky color dye it didn&#x27;t come out too bold and has turned my streak a lovely jewel-toned dark pink/magenta shade. If you want a lighter or bolder shade you&#x27;re going to have to lighten your hair first as per the instructions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am more than happy with it as it is. The product was very easy to use, smelled delightful, and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with staining but then I&#x27;ve only done a tiny section of my hair so it&#x27;s not like I made a mess all over the bathroom when I was using it. The only thing I would say is that you can and should leave it on for a lot longer than the instructions say. Having done some research and read other reviews I left it for 2 hours before rinsing, which seems to have worked. I can&#x27;t comment on how long the dye lasts as I only did it this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve had a little practice and like the result I intend to do more sections when it needs retouching. At this price I might even try out some other colors! I&#x27;ve attached an image so that anyone else with brown hair can see what it looks like without bleaching first. The pic doesn&#x27;t really do it justice as the lighting conditions weren&#x27;t great when I took it, but I hope it helps anyway!</li>
    <li> so just got my hair color in the mail at 3 this afternoon was so excited i used it right after i opened it&lt;br /&gt;ive used manic panic color jams and this color blows these out of the water its just as good as parvana which is a permant color and is sold only to hair stylest as iam one&lt;br /&gt;i got the pink and it was the same color as shown on the label that rarely happens&lt;br /&gt;ive had pink for a while now and its never the dark pink ive had one time and the color jamz dosnt make the pink i like anymore&lt;br /&gt;now im so happy going to buy more for me and my friends&lt;br /&gt;love love LOVEEE!!!!!!!  &amp;#60;3 :)</li>
    <li> I last dyed my hair in January. To be fair, I have been dyeing it for the last year, and I bleach the snot out of it in between colorings, and wash my hair probably 2 times a week, so it&#x27;s as sheltered as a dye color can be, BUT it looks fantastic. It&#x27;s still really pink, except for the most damaged tips. People compliment it almost every time in  I go out, and since I also had my last haircut in January, I know they&#x27;re really saying, \\&quot;I am validating the self expression you&#x27;re choosing with your hot pink hair!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy this dye. I know \\&quot;atomic pink\\&quot; gets touted as the very best, but I have never been willing to spend $17 on a 4 oz bottle when Jerome Russell is less than half the price and produces brilliant results.</li>
    <li> I tried every semi-permanent brand out there and all of them fade rather quickly, mostly 2 weeks top. This brand did not fade for at least 3-4 weeks, and the colors are beautiful. I also purchased the teal color, so I am excited to try that one next.</li>
    <li> This was not what I thought it was going to turn out. I bought this for my sister. Her favorite color is a bright hot pink. I thought that this would be great for her. It was a VERY VERY light colored pink. Not at all what is shown in the picture as the tester type thing. It comes in a darker colored dye but when you wash it out it was a super light pink not at all what she wanted. Or what we expected.</li>
    <li> It Arrived promptly and was a really good colour. Enough product to use three or four times on long hair.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite product for over 15years! I love it so much! It gets the job done! I will never use any other product!</li>
    <li> I usually use the violet one but decided to try the pink for spring.  I didn&#x27;t like it as much.  First of all I had to use the whole jar where I normally only use half of the violet.  It&#x27;s still fun but not my favorite.</li>
    <li> Bright Pink - Got this for my dog  and it is the best.  It has to stay wet for 30 minutes though, i would recommend putting on your dogs hair then going for a walk</li>
    <li> One of the better vivid color lines out there. Lasts a bit longer than manic panic and doesn&#x27;t smell funky like some do</li>
    <li> The colours are so vibrant. I mixed this with hair conditioner and applied them on my hair and kept it on for 30 - 45 mins. When I rinsed it off, not only did the colours not run as much as I thought they would be, the colours came out beautifully on my hair. I mixed this colour with purple too.&lt;br /&gt;Do remember to put on gloves and if any colour gets onto any surfaces, clean them out immediately otherwise they would really stain and it&#x27;s difficult to remove. The smell is also so nice! Love this product, how I wished I had discovered this earlier!</li>
    <li> I love Punky Color, the only problem is that instead of a bright pink I got a vibrant, purple-red. It&#x27;s very dark and doesn&#x27;t mesh well with the blue I chose. When trying to MIX colors, it overpowered the blue and instead of giving me purple, I have red hair.</li>
    <li> I love this color! I chose not to bleach my hair and the color still showed up, for reference I have light brown hair. The smell is amazing! I was reading reviews of this dye and was thinking that there is no way it smells good. It does! And it smells like grapes :)</li>
    <li> I have tried manic panic over and over because its available in stores in many colors but im ALWAYS disappointed in the chalky pigment and dull finish that lasts 2 or 3 washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Punky color his super pigmented, rich and creamy, the results are vibrant and last 3 times as long. Its really the way to go i just wish i could find more colors online</li>
    <li> Best hair dye in the world. Great quality and lasts for months without fading! It works better than any other dye I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair since I was 12,  Jerome Russell - punky color is by far the best and cheapest product I&#x27;ve ever used in my hair.</li>
    <li> really good for the price worked better than the more expensive dye I bought,i would recommend you buy this dye instead of berina</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was as described. Works great.  I dilute it with conditioner for a pastel pink.  Otherwise turns out Magenta.  I like it because it last longer and is less neon than other pinks I Have used.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I&#x27;m wondering if anything could ever compare. Perfect demi product! Just slap it on enlightened hair (bleached) &amp; sleep on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let mine dry completely in a cap overnight and it hardly bleeds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes for ANY color in this line.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> The color is more of a pinkish red than a true hot pink but its a very conditioning dye and the consistency of it means no dripping everywhere...I highly recommend that you cover all surfaces before dying though, unless you enjoy scrubbing counters for hours :)</li>
    <li> The absolute BEST hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used. I dyed my hair a month ago (even washed it relatively often the last two weeks) and the color has remained vibrant.</li>
    <li> The product arrived days before it was scheduled. I&#x27;m already familiar with the Flamingo Pink. It&#x27;s one of their longer lasting ones and the color is really vibrant. Sometimes I mix it with the Lagoon Blue for a nice purple.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinda of dyes on my hair for the last 3 years and punky colour has always been my #1. Manic panic comes out too fast, but punky is long lasting and stays vibrant.</li>
    <li> I use Punky Colors often. I think they last longer than Manic Panic. Flamingo Pink is a bright, medium fuchsia pink color, just lighter than the color of the dye itself.  If you don&#x27;t have blond or very light brown hair, you will have to lighten your hair beforehand to get the bright pink.  If your hair is too dark, it may look dull or like brown with a pink tint. My hair is naturally black and lightened to dark blonde. I place dye throughout my hair, and the color only shows on the lightened pieces. In my hair, it fades to a lighter fuchsia with purple undertones, not red or pale pink.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, thinking that with the amount of hair I have, I would go through them quickly. This stuff is long lasting! It took me months to work through both jars, even with fairly regular application. A little goes a very long way. The colour is vivid and fades extremely well. It doesn&#x27;t take well to brown hair, unlike some blues and reds, so make sure you bleach your hair or at least have it a lighter shade beforehand. I bought conditioner thinking that it would wreck my hair, but it actually conditions as it dyes. I&#x27;ve had no issues with split ends, dander, etc. I recommend this over Manic Panic any day.</li>
    <li> So far so good, i have never tried such amazing product. I had my hair dyed a million time in pop color: red, pink, purple and I know how hard it be to wash your hair without the pigment all over the places. I tried Flamingo Pink and let me tell you, after 3&#x27; minutes, the water is clean, really truly clean, no pigment at all. Magic? @.@</li>
    <li> It turned my hair deep magenta which isn&#x27;t what I wanted.  It does smell good, but that&#x27;s small consolation since I wanted a hot pink color.  I figured that since I did bleach my hair that&#x27;s would I would get.  Good news is that it washes out.  It&#x27;s a pretty color, but not the color I wanted.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for about 15 years, I&#x27;ve had it every color of the rainbow and have used  almost every product out there.&lt;br /&gt;It smells fruity, the color is very vibrant, doesn&#x27;t fade, doesn&#x27;t come off on my pillow case, and of course the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to people. And I have!</li>
    <li> Jerome Russell dyes are easy to use and last through several shampoos.  It does fade with each shampoo but you can try using shampoo for colored hair, cooler water, etc.  although I haven&#x27;t found that makes too much difference.  I use this for highlighting and touch it up usually every 4-5 days.  The color will totally wash out after about 8 or 9 shampoos.  I use this product on blonde hair so I&#x27;m not sure how long the color would last on hair bleached specially for coloring purposes.  I like that I can dip my brush into the jar versus having to squirt a blob onto something else like other containers that come in a bottle. :)  The dye is not runny - it has the consistency of hair gel which makes it easier to use.  Yes, it does stain everything it touches so be very careful to use protective gloves and don&#x27;t drip it on other stuff.</li>
    <li> i really like this brand. not as bleedy as manic panic. seems to stay on longer, too. i like that manic panic supports veganism. i totally try to support them as a company for that. but, punky is just superior in color.</li>
    <li> So cool. Beautiful vibrant color. Used it on chemically treated hair and virgin blonde hair and worked beautifully for both. I am not past 3 washes and the color is fading but doing so nicely. Affordable and awesome.</li>
    <li> I use this for cotton candy pink pastel hair - I just mix it with sulfate-free conditioner until it&#x27;s the color I want, then put it over dry, clean (lightened) hair (also don&#x27;t use conditioner before you dye), and leave it in as long as possible (2-3 hours, at least). It is by far THE BEST. Manic Panic fades with every wash, and this stuff is both cheaper and much more pigmented. To get pastels with Jerome Russell, I had to dilute the dye with 8-10 x white conditioner. I cannot recommend this brand enough!</li>
    <li> I love this color, mixed with a bit of purple and hair conditioner, for a cute pastel look! It lasts a super long time, it&#x27;s almost too long~</li>
    <li> I have had various hair colors, but never anything crazy (blue, pink, purple, green), just various blondes and reds and highlights.  After using some temporary pink spray on color for my Halloween costume, and getting a very positive response to the color from my boyfriend, I looked into using something more permanent.  The reviews for Jerome Russell Punky Colour Cream were great, and especially for Flamingo Pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it, and my order arrived the very next day, with the free shipping!  I didn&#x27;t expect it so fast, and was quite anxious to try it.  My hair is medium brown, and I color the regrowth about every 4 - 5 weeks.  I have an Ombre that is several shades lighter.  I decided to try the color without doing anything to lighten the color my hair is now.  Also, I decided to streak it, but under the top layer of hair, so it doesn&#x27;t complicate matters when I need to retouch my regrowth to cover my grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I streaked about 6 sections of hair, plus I covered my Ombre ends with the color.  I used gloves, and left the color on for about 45 minutes before rinsing off with cool water.  This color is quite messy and you have to be really careful not to get it on your clothes or towels or floor, etc.  My sink turned quite pink, but that scrubbed right off with Comet.  The end results are a very vibrant magenta color!  Even over my medium brown, the color is quite dramatic.  My boyfriend loves it, and depending on how it fades and lasts, I may consider lightening a few sections or just the Ombre, for future applications.  I wash my hair every 3 - 4 days, so I expect to have some degree of pink for a long time to come.  I may consider upping my review to 5 stars if it looks nice as it fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I LOVE that it smells like grape, too, even days after using it!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color!  This is a vibrant color that sticks.  I bleached my hair (peekaboo strip), applied the violet and then this over it.  What a fantastic POW of color.  Great product.  I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> My 9 yr old daughter really wanted to dye her hair a crazy color(temporary of course), and we have tried so many different brands and none changed her hair color whatsoever!! Figured I would try this and it actually works. She is super happy with it :)</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dye I have ever used. The color is brilliant. It smells good enough to eat. It leaves your hair shiny and soft. I learned to extend the color; sleep with the dye in your hair overnight. I consistently have a bottle of this brand dye in my home at all times. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> No problems. This is lasting about as long as most semi-permanent dyes. I often use Special Effects, but at the time I purchased this, Special Effects dyes were unavailable and/or about triple the price of Punky Colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a primary magenta for making my hair rainbow / all colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes:&lt;br /&gt;Semi-permanent dyes work better if you heat them while wet. :)&lt;br /&gt;Neutral Protein Filler is also a good idea, especially if you bleach repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;Most shampoos quickly destroy hair color.&lt;br /&gt;Most colors won&#x27;t work well over unbleached/brown hair. Magenta will do okay if you don&#x27;t mind a dark result.</li>
    <li> used this dye on a whim. mixed with white conditioner for a pastel look, turned out great. fades rather quickly, but if i had not mixed it with the conditioner and gone for the bolder, stronger colour i&#x27;m positive it would have lasted quite a while. definitely worth it</li>
    <li> Best semi permanent hair color for me!!! This pink is beautiful!!!</li>
    <li> I love this color and it does last a really long time - lasts longer if you use a gentle shampoo.  I used one whole pot on my hair but I have fairly long hair (in a braided tail it is below my shoulder blades).  The only issue I had and it was minor was my shower / bathtub looked like something had been slaughtered in it (until I cleaned it with a bleach based cleaner) after I rinsed my hair of the excess dye.  Did take several washings to get the dye out of the fabric shower curtain but it did come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a tad bummed by how quick it went from really bright pink to a muted pink but 1) I use head and shoulders and that strips the color right out and 2) I did not bleach my hair first and 3) my hair is a medium brown with medium blonde permanent dye that has grown out. I dye a permanent medium blonde during the fall / winter / spring and go pink for the summer - I dyed my hair June 1 this year and now at the end of July it&#x27;s still go ta bit of pink tones to it but it&#x27;s mostly back to its &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shade.</li>
    <li> The color was an exact match to the sticker on the bottle.  Bright and very pretty.  The hair color smelled like candy, very pleasant.  I got some on my skin while coloring my daughter&#x27;s hair and, while hair color normally stings/burns my sensitive skin, I had no adverse effects from this.  The color has lasted for weeks.  We used this to dye the tips of my daughter&#x27;s hair while doing the rest blue.  It lasted through several applications and the color faded very little even though she went swimming a lot in a chlorinated pool over the the summer.  We will be buying this again to color her hair.  This is a better product than &amp;#34;Splat&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Manic Panic&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I had my blond hair highlighted to get very &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; blond chunks then added this.  It is not bubble gum type flamingo its fuschia pink.  I still like it though.  It stays in a long time.  I am on month three now and its finally faded to a lighter pink but still not pastel.</li>
    <li> Very messy color. Color bleeds out a lot in the first 2 weeks of washes. I like the bright color but as messy as it was it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> smaller than picture.  but okay</li>
    <li> Great product.  I dyed streaks that I bleached from black hair to a light orange and it came out light purple/pink.  May show up hot pink on lighter hair, though I can&#x27;t vouch for that.  Long lasting, easy to use.</li>
    <li> beautiful, super vibrant and vivid color. does bleed quite a bit when washing, but oddly color doesn&#x27;t seem to fade at all, and you can use this to your advantage with some planning. for example, i used this on the top layers of my hair, directions turquoise in the middle and directions midnight blue on bottom. over time and washes, the fuschia is blending into the blue and making a really pretty ombre that gets compliments almost every time i go out. seriously, 9 out of 10 places i go to, someone will tell me they love it. that&#x27;s pretty nice. :) also smells good, fruity when you put it on.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t bleach my hair, it is mostly dark reddish brown at the top layers and silver underneath. I used the flamingo pink and it turned the silver into a bright magenta pink and the dark brown turned a rich dark pink color. It&#x27;s really pretty and I love it :) and it smells like grape candy too</li>
    <li> AMAZING color! I have had pink in my hair for years and I honestly get it re-dyed probably every four to five months.  It does fade, but the pink never really goes away.  I do bleach it first because I have very dark hair but seriously, this stuff is build to last.  It even smells amazing- I&#x27;ve always described it as a sweet berry, but each person seems to think something different.  My hairdresser bought a different brand but when I showed her this she swapped over.  Super-cheap and the best funky color dye.  This is more of a darker, fuchsia pink when first died, but fades to a lighter pink.  I cannot say that I love it enough but I will buy it forever!</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> This color is the best out there. It is thick so it coats hair well without drips and the color stays without fading for longer than other brands. And it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Everyone loves this color. Been using this for three years now. I&#x27;m addicted. Plus shipping was perfect.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! The same doesn&#x27;t do it justice. I have had the color in my hair now for about three weeks and it hasn&#x27;t faded at all, probably because I avoid shampooing it every single day. The only problem is with bleed; even after a few weeks, it&#x27;s still rubbing off on my nice clothes. Also, when I do shampoo it, it&#x27;s a *waterfall* of dark purple-pink. It stains my skin. It&#x27;s curious: the color is much more resistant to fade than other colors, but it also bleeds more than any dye I&#x27;ve ever had in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s lovely. I get tons of compliments on it. I can say that it has lasted longer than the Manic Panic I tried...I had put wisps of Manic Panic in with it, and it looked great for the first few days. Then, the pink literally consumed the blue, which faded to the point that I assume the bleach blond underneath was dyed while shampooing my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone know if the shower watercolors will stop? No way you could swim with this!</li>
    <li> This pink is awesome! I&#x27;ve had the color in my hair for over a month with daily shampooing and its still a nice pink. Tho at first the color was more of a darkish magenta, now its a nice cotton candy pink. Smells fruity also .. yum. A lot better then manic panic colors.. i bought their cotton candy and it washed out in under a week. Wish i knew about this brand sooner.</li>
    <li> Worked phenomenally, much better than manic panic and rivaled pravana&#x27;s staying power. Covered entire medium length hair with enought for highlights as touch ups. My daughter had numerous compliments.Fades nicely.</li>
    <li> Before I used this color, my hair was Dark blue, so I bleached it to a seafoam green and put this color over it. It turned out a beautiful purplish pink. I&#x27;m definitely looking forward to using this again</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! 6 weeks in my hair and still bright pink. Doesn&#x27;t make your shower look like a murder scene when you wash it out either.</li>
    <li> This looked great when I mixed it with red wine. Love the color and the smell was nice. A+ Punky Colour.</li>
    <li> I bought this dye after being sick of Splat dye bleeding from my hair. Flamingo Pink is a magenta color, and the dye has a sweet cherry like smell as I notice most Punky Colors do. The dye lasts me about a month until it fades, a pretty average lasting time. When it fades it is a nice pale pastel pink. It doesn&#x27;t bleed after the first wash or so. I sort of wish more came in a jar at once, but that is my only complaint.</li>
    <li> The color is vibrant and AMAZING. I mixed it in with my purple hair dye that my hair currently has, and it made a very beautiful pinky purpley color and it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t be an idiot like me-- WEAR GLOVES when applying it. I thought I could get away with a brush and just moving bit of my hair around with my fingers. My entire left hand was crazy pink. I&#x27;m dumb and don&#x27;t know why I did that. It washed off with a a bit of scrubbing so it was all good. Other than that though it wasn&#x27;t really terribly messy. I would very highly recommend this dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, IT SMELLS GREAT AND I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHY</li>
    <li> Best hair dye ever!!!!</li>
    <li> If funky vibrant color is what you&#x27;re looking for this is where it&#x27;s at. Easily applied and not fast to fade. As a cosmetologist I have used several professional color lines, when it comes to crayon colored hair dye this is a must.</li>
    <li> Great, great, great color. I put this over a faded blue, and it&#x27;s so pigmented it covers right over it. When this starts to fade, I mix it half and half with conditioner and apply it in the shower, leave it on for 5+ minutes, and it looks great again.&lt;br /&gt;I have been dying my hair for 2+ years and this is the best pink dye I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair with this over a month ago, and the color (a brilliant fucshia) still looks the same as it did the day that I dyed it, albeit a little duller. This dye works much better on my hair than Manic Panic dyes, which only stayed in for 2 or 3 washes. Needless to say, I will be buying this again when I touch up my roots!</li>
    <li> color was bright and lasts long</li>
    <li> good color, very very  very long lasting as far as a semi permanent color is concerned. it even smells really good lol.</li>
    <li> The color is bright and beautiful, I had it in for Christmas, and it is still vibrant, You do want to shampoo as little as possible though because it does wash out, I only died half of my hair so I still have some left, It is a beautiful color and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this after only 10 minutes it was so bright! Probably the best color they have.&lt;br /&gt;Most people ask me me if my hair is red...I think that is because I have the rest of my hair black so it doesn&#x27;t look as pink as it may on say a blonde.&lt;br /&gt;I loved this though. It&#x27;s been about 4 weeks and it&#x27;s still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;The color definitely does get on everything but that&#x27;s what you want. If it didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;d be concerned about the hair dye itself. I want it to stain a lot the way it should my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have dark hair. I bleached it twice and it was fairly orange/brown. The color held perfectly. I also have the violet dye and love it!&lt;br /&gt;I used color brilliance before and IT SUCKED. IT was the worst.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use anything except punky color!</li>
    <li> I get my hair bleached professionally about every six weeks and then I dye it crazy colors myself. My stylist was shocked when I came in with this pink still so pretty and vibrant. It is my opinion that this color lasts the longest and fades out the prettiest of all the Punky Colour dyes I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried most of them. This color starts out a very dark pink and then fades into a beautiful medium shade of pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair every other day and use cold water and this keeps the fading to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color does transfer onto my pillowcases but washes out without having to use bleach. It also has never stained my bathtub, but if it does stain yours just use a cleaner with bleach. I always wear gloves the first couple times I wash my hair so my hands won&#x27;t turn pink.</li>
    <li> My new go to semi permanent hair color. I love this brand. Product smells great and goes on easily!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product in Flamingo Pink. It goes on evenly, it gives a bright color, and it lasts with no bleeding onto fabrics and skin. Unfortunately the other two colors I&#x27;ve tried (Apple Green and Purple) are completely mislabeled. Apple Green is far more of a light turquoise once all is said and done, and Purple is merely Flamingo Pink without the brightness. I did find that using Purple and then layering Flamingo Pink over it a few days later results in a beautiful color with a little more depth than the plain Flamingo Pink though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t follow the instructions on the bottle. I put the color on dry hair, leave in for at least an hour, then rinse, shampoo, and condition in cold water. I continue to use cold water for washing and conditioning daily, and after a week I re-color. Once I do this a few times, the color stays very little fading for at least a month (unless I switch to hot water). I&#x27;ve never had any bleeding onto my clothes, pillows, towels, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;ve dripped color onto the counter or onto my skin when applying, I use a diaper wipe immediately and it completely removes the color. If the colors sits there for a few minutes, it will stain but within a day or two of using a regular cleanser/soap the color is completely gone. I&#x27;ve had no issues with staining the tub or sink while rinsing, either.</li>
    <li> Its way darker then what it appears. So really didn&#x27;t use it because it was not what I expected ooh boy</li>
    <li> As always Jerome Russell has amazing colors this one though is more red tented then pink or as the pot looks online purple. It&#x27;s like a magentaish color.</li>
    <li> mmmm yummy yummy, this dye color cream smell delicious just like strawberrys, the color is intense so if you want a lighter color like pink baby, this is not the color, BUT, you can lighter with conditioner. Is more like a fucsia tone.&lt;br /&gt;But I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is lovely dye! It&#x27;s my favorite brand and lasts the longest. It is semi permanent, so it will fade over time. I also used a violet color, and it lasted for about a month while slowly fading into my sandy blonde hair again. However, I do wash my hair almost everyday. With both dyes, I&#x27;ve applied it straight to my hair without bleaching it first and it goes on well, I leave it for 1/2 an hour, and it&#x27;s vibrant for a couple weeks. I attached a couple pictures of me right after I dyed it, if that gives any point of reference.</li>
    <li> Great product. I used it to tint my dark hair...good results.</li>
    <li> Fun and great color &#x3D; love it!</li>
    <li> -Arrived in god time&lt;br /&gt;-Is as what was advertised&lt;br /&gt;-Smells like I could eat it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this dye to give myself pastel pink hair, and it only took a small bit of the dye to mix with (white) hair conditioner to create a pastel pink that was strong enough to stick in my hair. The dye seemed to last forever in the jar... even though the jar is just slightly smaller than Manic Panic&#x27;s. No matter how many times I re-dyed my hair, I always had more at the bottom of the container!</li>
    <li> This color is so vibrant. I normally have trouble finding colors that stay true to bottle, but not with this the color was amazing and lasted longer then I could have even hoped for. I actually bleached it out because it lasted so long and I was ready to change my hair color again. I will never use another hair dye but this ever again</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color......It&#x27;s not quite the flamingo pink I expected but it&#x27;s a vibrant fuschia color!!!!!!!! I might try other colors from this brand in the future!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Jerome Russell is easy to apply, is easy on my hair (no harsh chemicals!), and lasts FOREVER. I had 2 inches of roots long before I needed to touch up my color.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a punky color that LASTS and LASTS- look no farther! Plus, for the price- it&#x27;s an incredible value!</li>
    <li> I love love love this brand of dye!!</li>
    <li> I put this stuff on my hair for the first time about a month ago, and yesterday was the first time I had to touch it up. A straight month of vibrant color; that&#x27;s pretty incredible. The color stays fresh for a really long time. I noticed it just starting to fade after about a week and a half, and after that it faded into a pastel pink with white tips. I don&#x27;t have much hair and the pot took care of two sessions for me. If your hair goes past your jaw I suggest buying more that one to cover your whole head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I included some pictures. The first is freshly dyed and the second is after a month. My hair was very, very light blotchy pink/white (from a failed dye attempt with another brand) when I first dyed it.</li>
    <li> Super easy to apply and lasts a few weeks, even with daily washing.... Beautiful color!!! (Honestly it does show more purple than pink but its still beautiful.)</li>
    <li> I pretty much always used Manic Panic in the past. I don&#x27;t know if they changed their formulation or what, but I wasn&#x27;t getting the results that I wanted any longer. I tried this color and brand on a whim, and am glad that I did! I dyed my hair at the end of January, I&#x27;m writing this review in April, and my hair is still bright. Yes the color has faded over time, from a deep darker pinky purple to a more hot pink-ish color, with some areas still holding on to the darker pink color. This is even after getting lazy and washing my hair in warm water! So yeah I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Comes out more red in bleached yellow hair. I&#x27;m sure if my hair was bleached to white it would have come out pink, but so far, no complaints.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s been two months my hair hasn&#x27;t even faded doesn&#x27;t smell terrible I get complemented all the time I think I&#x27;m sticking with this color and this brand my roots are in but the color is so even and vibrant almost looks like I did it on purpose. so here are the suggestions I used loreal hair color remover then a lightening kit it was super blonde then I gave my hair a week to settle after that I put the color on and left it in for an hour I have hair to the middle of my back and onto did the top half the bottom is black I left it on for an hour and washed it out in the sink not the shower it will super stain. wash out then blow dry or it will turn everything pink. after that your hair will be true pink for months on end</li>
    <li> I love this color. I&#x27;ve had bad luck with salon-grade colors and Manic Panics fading after a few washes lately, but I&#x27;m on week three of repeated washings and it&#x27;s still dark and shiny! Love, love, love...</li>
