    <li> There was a noticeable improvement in skin bumps the morning after applying the balm to the affected area.  It did not leave residue on clothing.  It did leave a waxy film over the skin but was barely noticeable and washed off easily. There was no offensive odor. I was impressed that it worked so quickly and performed exactly as advertised.</li>

    <li> Enjoyed my purchased. This product was recommended to me by a Beautician and I&#x27;ve been using it every since. Not greasy. Smell isn&#x27;t bad but it is loud but still tolerable. Really cures and grows your hair.But I didn&#x27;t get the free Hollywood bar soap that they advertised with the hair grease.</li>
    <li> My brother swears by this product, however I used it for several weeks and it did not do much at all for me.</li>
    <li> It is very good for the value</li>
    <li> I would say this stuff definitely works to relieve flaky dandruff and sores from my scalp condition (I think psoriasis) I&#x27;ve had for years.  Product is delivered in a timely fashion.</li>
