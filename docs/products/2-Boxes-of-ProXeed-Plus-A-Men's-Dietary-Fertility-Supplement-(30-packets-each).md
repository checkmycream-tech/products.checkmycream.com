    <li> came as advertised, tastes like crap</li>
    <li> very good，it is the cheapest in amazon。</li>
    <li> that is useful for my husband&#x27;s sperm</li>
    <li> Very good product, highly recommended to those who are trying to conceive. You should buy it you wont regret it!</li>
    <li> I got it on time no problems, right product, good flavor, no complains, I will reorder this product next month.</li>
    <li> They give several nutrients, and in that way, are good. But, overall, my husband&#x27;s count didn&#x27;t improve much, if at all, after taking this supplement for over 3 months. Still TTC.</li>
    <li> Good stuff  but the taste was bitter</li>
    <li> Very good, things got very satisfied</li>
    <li> My husband used it haphazardly during the 3 month suggested period and we got pregnant.  Now we have a beautiful 6 month old.  We are using it again for #2!</li>
    <li> In the United States for the first time to buy things, amazon is received less than two weeks. The seller is very honest, good product quality. Now in use, the hope can achieve the result of hope earlier. Will buy again if necessary.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the recommendation of my urologist and I&#x27;m very satisfied. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;am going to buy the two boxes in few days.</li>
    <li> The products arrived earlier than i expected, but the expire date is too near. Some of the powders stick together in clumps</li>
    <li> My sperm count was good, no prob with that, however barely 5% had good motility. After three months of treatment motility is above 80%. No additional treatment or change in my habits.</li>
    <li> Works good but we not sure if the problem it&#x27;s fix</li>
    <li> Very expensive. There&#x27;s another supplement that is cheaper and in pill form. It also has a higher mg/mcg dosage for all of the vitamins included. Not sure what has propped up this product so high in reviews. Why would I choose to take this twice a day, mix it in water, and choke down the awful taste, when there is a once a day pill available with a 3 month supply cheaper than this one month supply. It also doesn&#x27;t mix well with water. After using it for the last 6 months, we still aren&#x27;t pregnant and my counts were not bad to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy all the hype!!</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this product for me, I started with 1packet for 15day, I love it so I ordered for more, it is a good product to me</li>
    <li> It comes from Romania, some worry that the formula is not the same, but sell the home to say for sure, they are the same formula. Don&#x27;t know why shipped from Romania, so strange!</li>
    <li> Good and fast seller.</li>
    <li> my friend said it worked great</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived in great condition</li>
    <li> expire date is too close, since this medicine should taken for a long time it&#x27;s from worth to be sent with closely expiration date</li>
