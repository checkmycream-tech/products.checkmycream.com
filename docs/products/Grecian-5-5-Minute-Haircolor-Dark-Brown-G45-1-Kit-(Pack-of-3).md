    <li> Excellent.  But, no longer available.</li>
    <li> Just want to let everyone know that Grecian 5 works, covers gray evenly and looks natural, been using over five years.</li>
    <li> Good product. I use it to grey my beard. Thought was buying the one for beard. Didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> It really is a terrific product.  It&#x27;s amazing how it fills in the color about 90% making it look really natural. No idea how they do it, but it&#x27;s terrific.&lt;br /&gt;It works well, and doesnt seem to  cause as much of an allergic reaction as other products.</li>
    <li> I have always liked greechin hair color but lately I cannot find it at many places where I use to buy it. Tell me what is the problem with it being not vaible</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it has always been great to cover the gray hairs. Very easy to use and always a good price on Amazon</li>
    <li> My dad is going to love it anyway, he use it since i was a kid. Well accepted brand surly</li>
    <li> Does the job but got too expensive!</li>
    <li> I was going to buy this for my husband, but I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s banned in Europe and Canada.  It contains 10 times more than what’s allowed in household paint!  Always read your labels.</li>
    <li> good stuff , 10yrs gone away</li>
    <li> Great product.... works just as advertised... best part is it hold up to the elements including taking swims in the pool.... thanks for your product, it&#x27;s great....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be glad to advocate for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Fred</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different hair color (ash tones, men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, different brands) and this is the only hair color I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t make my hair have reddish and brassy undertones, which I hate. Sucks that is been discontinued and the retailers here on Amazon and eBay keep price gouging and jacking up the price.  Can anyone recommend a proven other option in case this disappears completely? Thanks</li>
    <li> The description was misleading.  They said it would come with mixing tray and brush, which would allow multiple applications.  I informed them and they must have fixed the description now.  Anyways, the reason I paid the price was the possibility of multiple applications, otherwise I would have bought another product.</li>
    <li> It was overall out standing.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I will continue ordering it as long as it is sold by terrific sellers via Amazon.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> excellent-used it for years and now having difficulty finding it in the Macon stores.  No longer stocking it in the macon stores</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product. He says is easy to use and the results are perfect, very natural. He tried others before but when he found Grecian this has been the one for him, The only one he uses and will use, he is very happy with this Haircolor and he uses it on his beard and it works great, very natural.</li>

    <li> This is better than Just For Men it gets in there better and I would say works 3 times as good and the hair stays colored longer. Well worth a few extra bucks.</li>
    <li> My husband was using this product for years, with great success and ease. That is until recently when I spent considerable amount of time going from store to store hoping to find this product. After not being successful, I ended up bying another product. I called the manufacturor and found out that the product has been discontinued due to poor sales. I could not believe it. Sadly, would have to find another product.</li>
