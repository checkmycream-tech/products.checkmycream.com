<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My CHI lasted for 10 years, when it bit the dust, I didn&#x27;t feel like forking out $100+ for a new flat iron. I feel like this eliminates frizz more effectively, it heats up quickly, I like that I can control the temperature. The digital display makes it look fancy. It definitely curls better than the CHI (when I&#x27;m in the mood for a flat iron curl)... Overall, I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better flat iron for the price.</li>
    <li> This flat iron easily straightens my hair. I&#x27;m black and my hair is coarse, so I&#x27;m really happy with this product. It also works very well and extensions, clip-ins, weaves, you name it. And it curls very very well. I also love the temperature choices they have on it. I totally recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible flat iron! It is fast to heat up, works very well and I have very thick hair and was done in minutes.  I&#x27;m so happy that a friend had one that I was able to use a few times before purchasing.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves it! Great flatiron for the cost!</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s perfect! It doesn&#x27;t feel like I only paid what I did. It feels like it should be more expensive!</li>
    <li> I loooooove this straightener!! I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and it&#x27;s amazing on my hair. I have color treated, naturally wavy, thick yet fine hair that goes just passed my shoulders and I can straighten my hair in about 7-10 minutes really well. I don&#x27;t really use products on my hair except for a heat protecting/shine oil and use heat on it maybe 1 or 2 times a month. It may just be me but I often will be straightening my hair and sense a little bit of a sweet smell coming from it, like honey. I always use it at 340° and it&#x27;s super hot already ha heats up fast and looks good too. I don&#x27;t have to clean it often since I don&#x27;t really use products on my hair but when I do it&#x27;s super quick and comes off easily. I LOVE it. I would definitely buy it again if anything happened to it or it stopped working. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully!!! Heats up quickly, and leaves hair so soft!</li>
    <li> Bought this straightener after my old conair flatiron started smelling like it was burning up inside every time I turned it on. I&#x27;d had my conair flatiron for nearly 4 years so it was long overdue for a new one and I just needed something cheap that gets the job done. For only $5 more than what I paid 4 years ago I got 100 better quality with this flatiron! Heats up quickly and leaves my thick curly hair straight and shiny in just one pass, and I don&#x27;t even have to use the highest heat setting! On my conair it was set to the highest setting and I still had to pass over each section 5 or 6 times for my hair to stay halfway straight. Even better, with the Remington flatiron my hair Stayed straight all day with no touch ups and even lasted after I slept on it - just needed to run over it really quickly in the morning to knock out the overnight waves. With the conair, the alabama humidity would get to my hair as soon as I stepped outside and waves and curls would jump right back in. Great product for the price, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy another when this one dies! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have owned a chi and this is honestly a close second to my chi. I purchased this because my straightener broke and I didn&#x27;t want to shell out tons of money for a new one but I ended up loving this one! It has floating ceramic plates that are less damaging to your hair and I love the sleek look of it and the blue lcd display. My favorite feature is the auto shut off after an hour. This is the best cheap straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. Feels and works like a high end flat iron.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep it simple.They work!Its great!</li>
    <li> Seems to working great.  So much lower in price than a Chi and seems to work just as well.  My hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck in any areas - this has happened with some.  Wonderful buy.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and evenly.</li>
    <li> Bought as a quick replacement for a CHI and I love it! Heats up in about 3-5 minutes. Straightens and curls. Great quality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this flat iron! I like how you can adjust the exact temperature . I&#x27;m African American and it does really well on my hair. Doesn&#x27;t break off my hair at all. Also I like how you can lock it close so that it will help fit wherever you want to store it.</li>
    <li> very good  product for the price</li>
    <li> This product is truely amazing ....I am 2years natural and Iam so glad I baught this product ...I just baught 2 more ...it has my ends looking healthy and it leaves a silky feel to your hair. .. this product is well worth it and cheep I fell in love wirh this today when I received it and just finished using the product ....I am very very happy with this product and I will recommend it to everyone and may even buy a few more as Christmas gifts. ... thankyou so much... I just baught a few for the family ....I give this a 10 out of 10</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t a Paul Mitchell but for 1/4 the price definitely runs pretty close to it!</li>
    <li> Got this because my old straighner smelled way too burnt so i went ahead and purchsed this. It came a day early. i was so excited to try it and it heated up really quick in like seconds! Until a few days i noticed it smelled a bit burnt then again it is a straighner but not as much as my old straighner. Would still recommend this!</li>
    <li> I received my flat iron today and it works perfectly, just as good as a salon flat iron. Very sleek and the handle is firm and doens&#x27;t feel flimsy at all. Delivery came on time.  My only negative is that I can&#x27;t give this a 10 star! I highly recommend this product and will definitely buy from this seller again!!! Excellent item! Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> fast heating, safety ensured, strengthening my hair efficiently.</li>
    <li> This straightener is amazing for the price. I like that you can change the temperature and that this gets very hot! My hair used to get caught in other straighteners, but never had that issue with this one. This straightener is a steal!!!</li>
    <li> Christmas gift. Daughter says its the best flat iron she has ever used.</li>
    <li> definitely a great buy!!</li>
    <li> Very nice flat iron.  It does the job and does it without making my hair frizzy.  I like how it heats up extremely fast compared to my old iron.</li>
    <li> Love this flatiron...doesn&#x27;t pull, nice smooth action.</li>
    <li> Am inlove with this flat iron</li>
    <li> Excellent product for both the price and performance. Other reviews have indicated that this straightener &amp;#34;scratches&amp;#34; your hair; but, I feel like this sensation only happens if you are straightening a really little section of hair, or, if you have really thin hair. Delivery was quick--it was delivered to my home within 2 days. This beauty product heats up promptly and leaves your hair feeling soft and silky. Definitely use a heat-protecting spray or gel before using this straightener. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, heats up extremely fast and great on any types of hair.</li>
    <li> Love it!  So fast and easy to use.  Worth it!</li>
    <li> Works great -- if I can figure it out (I am beauty product challenged) anyone can. Not as good as when I go to the salon but pretty good for work mornings etc.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I share this and we both love it.  She has fine hair and I have coarse hair.  We like that it has a digital setting and the temperature can be set for her fine hair or my coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Best priced flat iron around. The adjustable heat settings are an added bonus rather than your typical, low-high. Feels high end without having a high price tag. I keep mine extra safe in a heat proof carrying case and don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving it out to cool first.</li>
    <li> I just bought this a few weeks ago but I have been very happy. I have started curling my hair with my straightener and my old one was pulling. This one is very smooth but I do have to keep my sections of hair smaller then I would normally like when I curl it. Make sure your hair is completely dry. I recommend having product in your hair as well. It will help keep the shape.</li>
    <li> i just returned an hersryler flat Iron and got this instead! I absolutely love it, my hair is very thick and this flat iron gives me the same result I get in the salon !! This is like a professional flat iron at 1/4 of the price!!</li>
    <li> The best straightner I&#x27;ve ever used! Leaves hair soft and silky, and straightens quickly and evenly!</li>
    <li> It worked like it&#x27;s supposes to. Very sleak design gets hot quick.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron its easy to use. It does a great job. Its easy to use and its design is not only great to straighten hair but also curl.</li>
    <li> Heats up in a jiffy and has total temperature controls. Love it. It&#x27;s really great quality.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, great value great product</li>
    <li> I use this as my every day straightener. The temperature heats up fast and can get super hot. I keep it on 320 and my hair straightens great, and I think it heats up to at least 400 degrees. As with any straightener, don&#x27;t clamp it too tight, because you will get weird heat dents in your hair. Temporary of course. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> Love it!! And very fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> Gets the job done and warms up quickly! I love how the cord is on a swivel so it doesn&#x27;t get stuck or tangled</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s are mixed race and ive been thru so many straighteners and i found this one works the best it leaves their hair silky and straight with no friz i recommend using a hot temp oil with this product thou to avoid breakage.</li>
    <li> Had a friend recommend because she curls her hair with it and I&#x27;ve been wanting a straightener that can curl too. However my hair is thick and it straighens well but can&#x27;t curl. Love it nonetheless!</li>
    <li> I bought this over a year ago and it still works really great. Makes my hair frizz free and shiny.</li>
    <li> This heats up really quickly and works really well. I have thick hair and I don&#x27;t have to put it on the highest setting to work. The one downside I&#x27;d say is that it&#x27;s rounded, while probably helps with using it as a curler it makes it hard to keep upright when sitting on the counter and it constantly falls on its side. But I&#x27;ve never burned myself or anything else, so that&#x27;s not a huge deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it&#x27;s very sleek and looks pretty. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 months and it still works great. Don&#x27;t know why people spend over $100 on straighteners.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Spend a little more for a quality flat iron. This is NOT ceramic. It pulls my hair, feels like I&#x27;m running my hair thru sandpaper and I have never had so many split ends and breaks in my life. Yes, I use an excellent heat protector before flat ironing my hair yet the split ends multiply by the hundreds every day. It also takes twice as long to do my hair. I&#x27;m going back to Solia. Awesome flat iron and it doesn&#x27;t cost as much as others ($70-90 on Amazon). Very smooth going thru my hair and it works fast! You get what you pay for. This one is going to the garbage.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, compact, and a quick heat time are some of the outstanding features to this reasonably-priced flat iron. The ergonomic balance between the top and bottom blades - making the angled presses to the sides and back hair more comfortable - are other great design elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of careful thought went into this appliance: you can lock in your preferred heat setting from the baseline of 300 to 450 degrees; the blades can be locked in the closed position for travel or storage; a swivel cord attachment at the unit base prevents snags or awkward hands holds - an important safety feature when handling hot surfaces; and a 6-foot long extension cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also liked the LCD Indiglo display on the top blade of this iron. This iron worked as fast on smooth, thin hair as on curly, thick hair. If you are in the market for a flat iron, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Heats up in seconds, nice sleek design. Gives a nice result whether straightening or curl</li>
    <li> I use this product every day of the week pretty much!!!!!!!!!! Absolutely love this so much more than my old chi!!!!!</li>
    <li> The Remington Pearl is an excellent flat iron for your hair.  It headed up in mere seconds and it smoothly slid through my hair without sticking, kinking up or having to go over the same spot over and over.  It&#x27;s small and compact and would be very easy to travel with and stow away.  Highly recommend it for all hair types and lengths.</li>
    <li> I love this straighter, I have super fine thin hair so have to be very careful about heat settings. The heat lock feature is perfect. The temperature range is good as well from 300 to 450.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend performing a heat &amp; cool cycle prior to first use, just my personal opinion however.&lt;br /&gt;The functions are user friendly but would recommend reading the instructions as well to make sure you take advantage of all the features.</li>
    <li> Works well for my hair - short/medium length. Heats up real fast.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice flat iron for a low cost. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months or so and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. Its straightens hair nicely, however it does pull your hair slightly. Its not something that would cause me to not use it or anything and thats really the only flaw. My last flat iron cost $100 and pulled my hair worse than this, so it may just be my hair type also. Anyway I wouldn&#x27;t waste money on another $100+ flat iron after this one has worked so well for me.</li>
    <li> Im new to straightening my hair.  But I LOVE this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Heats up really quick and works perfect. Nice temp display and easy off.</li>
    <li> Heats up super quickly and works well. My hair is an average thickness and I never need to turn the heat all the way up. Also love how sleek it looks.</li>
    <li> This straightener is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the same hairdryer and straightener for the past 10 years and decided to upgrade when I saw Remington on sale the other day.&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed the first time I turned it on; it reached full heat in less than a minute!&lt;br /&gt;I was able to straighten my hair with less passes and (not sure why) my hair stayed straight for longer. On Valentines day, my hair braved a blizzard for a few minutes which would normally make it start going wavy within a few minutes, but it stayed straight all day into the next day.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it also displays the temperature; didn&#x27;t know before that I&#x27;m baking my hair at the same temp as I would bake a cake . . .</li>
    <li> Bought this for my best friend for her birthday and she loves it! Tames any kind of hair!</li>
    <li> pretty good straightner for the price, its not a chi but my best friend enjoyed it as her present, have owned two now and they really do a great job for a 20 straightner. ive always been a remington straightner fan! there so much better then the other names in its price range. chi is of course a much better option but for the money this would be my pick!</li>
    <li> Straightens hair really well, only complaint is that it keeps shutting off while i&#x27;m straightening my hair. And then when i was actually trying to shut it off, the button wouldn&#x27;t work so i had to unplug it.</li>
    <li> This is the first time and bought Flat Iron and I really love it. My friend recommend me to buy it to straighten my hair after shampoo. I would recommend this product because of its good quality.</li>
    <li> I hate doing my hair. This flat iron makes straightening a quicker, and so more tolerable, process. It heats up in seconds, and is very lightweight (which is one of the best parts. I used to have a heavier one, and I was much more reluctant to break it out.) I have very fine (as in thin and super breakable), long, naturally black hair. This iron doesn&#x27;t dry-out or burn my hair, and it works so quickly  I don&#x27;t have time to get frustrated and give up. The iron is so easy to maneuver that even the most clueless user could have a beautiful hairstyle in under 10 min. (I&#x27;m sure that means salon-quality style if you know what you&#x27;re doing and take your time.) It&#x27;s a great product for a really really great price-- especially since I would never, ever pay more than $30 for a tool I begrudgingly use. This one&#x27;s a win/win!</li>
    <li> i love it this product it work pretty well and heat really fast  ... i will buy this again .</li>
    <li> Remington S9500pp Pearl Pro Ceramic Flat Iron is a useful and worthwhile product. It is versatile because it has multiple temperature settings. However, it is really intended for shorter hair. Regrettably, it is not as useful for longer hair because it doesn&#x27;t do well with big sections of hair.</li>
    <li> This was a welcome replacement for my old, worn out flat iron. It heats up really quickly, and glides through my hair without ever snagging. I find it very easy to work with. No complaints at all--very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it. Her expectation was met and she said that the quality of the product was way better than she was expecting. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> heats up quickly, works much better than more expensive models</li>
    <li> Gets really hot but doesn&#x27;t grip hair good enough</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and I like the ability to adjust the temperature. Great product for the price</li>
    <li> amazing, works well and ir got on time</li>
    <li> Heats up very quickly and beeps when ready.  The ceramic works great adn doesn&#x27;t pull at your hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had. Heats up quick to various temps, styles great and will shut off if forgotten about. Great product for very reasonable price. My hair is very fine and course and it&#x27;s usually difficult to get it to hold the style but I have definitely noticed a difference with this iron-very happy.</li>
    <li> Quick heat (quite faster than others used so far), easy to use, wife says hair looks great and stylish. All the things you can expect from a good flat iron... recommended!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because of the price of the Remington S9500PP Pearl Pro Ceramic Flat Iron and all the things it said it had that other &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; (aka expensive) models/brands have but I felt that, if anything, Amazon would most likely give me a refund if it was just a horrible product.  Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t have to return it because I was very overwhelmingly and pleasantly surprised at the outcome of my hair after using this iron!  I have thin hair and to make matters worse its wavy.  it would be beautiful if I had thicker hair but because my hair is so thin my waves wind up looking more like stringy spaghetti by the end of the day which makes me look HORRIBLE all the way around. although straightening my hair has caused it to look even more thin, I&#x27;ve found products that pump the roots up after a shower and so all I do is blow dry (on the cool setting), plump those roots up and dry the hair in preparation of ironing and I have to say my hair looks great and have received compliments on it :)&lt;br /&gt;I only got this one because my other Remington Wet 2 Straight I leave at the office in case I&#x27;m running late in the mornings.  I always use the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; hair setting, not that I need it, but it does a great job as well and I decided to just stick with Remington since I had bad experiences with Conair and the other one...can&#x27;t remember the name.&lt;br /&gt;But not all straighteners are created equal!  But this one was definitely not what I expected since I was expecting very little because of the price.  I&#x27;m glad I was proven wrong :)  my hair and I are thankful!  I only use the setting at 360-380 degree setting.  I find the higher ones are way too hot but I&#x27;m sure that people with way thicker hair then me could benefit from such a high setting :)</li>
    <li> I personally love mine and have no problems with it. It&#x27;s exactly what it looks like and works perfectly!!!!!</li>
    <li> I previously owned a $100+ flat iron and this one works just a good if not better.  Heat setting doesn&#x27;t have to be on the highest setting to get great results, I use 340 degrees and its perfect.  Glides smoothly.  Would definitely recommend this product for the great price.</li>
    <li> Did not come in original packaging. Thought it was brand new! Not happy it had a few scratches!</li>
    <li> excelente product I feel good. It is exactly what provides the seller</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!  I bought an expensive one and my hair was so frizzy, finally got fed up and purchased this, GREAT product! Took away the static and its only $24!!!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I really wanted to like this hot tool. I heard many good things about it but it did not meet my expectations. Which, is sad because I did not have high expectations for it. This hot tool did not close all the way which is odd considering it has a lock. But when using it, it did not clamp down enough on my hair. Also, the buttons where pretty hard to push, I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad product or what but I am not impressed. I ended up giving it away to a friend who needed a new straightener but did not want to buy one. She says it is okay and it is better than nothing, I agree with that. I would recommend it if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money but there are other ones that are a bit more and way worth the money. I think this would be okay for someone who already has bone straight hair, mine is a bit wavy as times. I would not give this to someone with curly hair, I do not think it would do much for them.</li>
    <li> Was very hesitant about purchasing a more less expensive flat iron, due to recently just starting to use one I didn&#x27;t want to put a lot of money into one until I knew if it would be a standard staple that I would use. I purchased this iron at a local store and I like it. The only draw back that I wish would change is that the swivel end where the cord is does tend to twist up especially if you use it a lot. Other than that for the money it is well worth it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favourite. I feel like I&#x27;ve just been to the salon when I use it. I use it at 320F with a heat proctectant spray - that&#x27;s the 2nd lowest setting.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! Leaves my hair silky and soft with very little frizz. I&#x27;m usually in a rush in the morning but it heats up quickly and is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a college student that does hair in my dorm. So my flat iron goes through a few heads, and I clean my flat iron after every use! These don&#x27;t give off that stench of &amp;#34;burnt hair&amp;#34; so that makes me happy! The temperature dial is digital so you know the temperature isn&#x27;t on some random in between number. Also it beeps when its to the temperature that you set! It works on ALL hair types!</li>
    <li> Honestly.. It&#x27;s the best flat iron I have ever used! So affordable and it gives you salon quality!! I love it!</li>
    <li> This Remington S9500 reaches usable temp very quickly. It&#x27;s preset of 380 allows for quick styling and the&lt;br /&gt;well located controls allow for fast adjustments. This flat iron is well designed and easy enough for a&lt;br /&gt;young girl to do her own styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.  Got it over the holidays and uses most everyday.  She ask for this model explicitly and she studies up on hair care products before asking for them or buying them herself.  Good job.</li>
    <li> Love this thing, especially love it&#x27;s automatic shut off ability. The only down side it that if you want to use a higher heat setting than 380 you have to change it every time you turn it on, being lazy I&#x27;ve given up on changing the temp and 380 works great on my hair!</li>
    <li> As an old user of $200 chi&#x27;s I had switched to Remington a few years ago for around $40.00 to get same quality. However, somehow their effectiveness got lost along the way this ceramic is okay and gets hot (not 450 like it states) but I definitely have to run it through my hair quite a bit and even then am not getting the type of straight that I&#x27;m used to. So right now I&#x27;m using it until I can find a better one</li>
    <li> Looks very nice, heats up quickly and works very well. I was very happy with all this but I wasn&#x27;t happy with one thing, it pinches me! At the base of the cord when you open and close the flat iron, there&#x27;s two pieces that come together and it pinches me every time I use it. Once it even cause me to bleed from being pinched! That really disappointed me because the rest of the product is very very good</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this straightener. It heats up quick.</li>
    <li> Gets super hot, super fast. Lightweight and easy to use. Inexpensive but not cheap!</li>
    <li> It works good for the price.... I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily suggest it to anyone that cares about the condition of your hair though as It&#x27;s pretty rough. I ended up buying a more expensive one. Probably would be a good straightener for a teenager.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve had and it was a good price. I can get to the roots better than my last flat iron and it leaves my hair nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday for my bangs. Tit heats up quick and gives my hair a nice shine.</li>
    <li> I have never used or owned a hair straightener before, so I requested this for review as a sort of novelty.  I have really lucky hair - not thin, not thick, and naturally curly (easily manageable with product) or straightenable with a hair dryer and ceramic barrel brush.  So I&#x27;ve never seen the need for a straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I used this twice today to try it out... once from dry hair that had been curly for two days, and once out of the shower.  The first time, I was honestly shocked at how quickly and easily it straightened the hair.  It wasn&#x27;t stick straight, since it had been curly for days, but it really did just relax most of the curl right out and left me with straight hair, but with lots of lift and body.  After the shower, it was the same thing.  I probably should have waited a little longer, as it was still a little damp, but I was getting impatient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron heats up at a truly remarkable speed.  I turned it on, and before I could even get the top layers of my hair clipped up, it had beeped to 380 degrees.  At some point in the process, I bumped it up 20 degrees since my hair was still slightly damp (that totally worked, by the way) and it took just about 10 seconds.  I wasn&#x27;t especially careful and I didn&#x27;t even come close to burning myself once on the flat iron.  The only caveat is to be careful about moving the just straightened hair, because it is holding a lot of heat.  Never once did I feel I was damaging my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really intuitive how to flip and move the iron to get the hair to go the direction you want.  I really love how it straightens but leaves body in the hair, unlike the hair dryer, which pulls it really flat.  I&#x27;m definitely going to go with this for a while for straightening my layers, which is a real pain with the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad to have requested this.. it is a great product and seems to be easy and safe for someone who has little idea what they are doing.</li>
    <li> So worried about purchase as there are so many of these out there to choose from. I am thrilled with the iron. I don&#x27;t have to turn it all the way to high to do the job. Leaves my hair looking smooth and shiny. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! It heats up extremely quick and my hair has never been straightened so easily! Great for flat iron curling too!</li>
    <li> It is very bad product, burning the hair and not ceramic. I do not recommend this product as it will damage your hair.</li>
    <li> Works great! Heats fast! Can change settings easily! Turns itself off in case you forget! Great tool!</li>
    <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating is that my previous straightener was over 10 years old and the comparison was not fair to start with.&lt;br /&gt;Really good product, it doesn&#x27;t feel like long term use will damage my hair (have used it for about one month so far). Silky result very fast (just one or two passes at each strand) and bonus: my hair doesn&#x27;t need to be 100% dry before I start straightening (but it needs to be dry enough).</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair silky soft with minimal frizz. Only downsde is that I bought this shortly before cutting my hair into a pixie and it&#x27;s a tad bit difficult to use on super short hair - be careful not to burn your face or fingers! Still works great on my longer bangs. Good flat iron.</li>
    <li> This straightener is amazing! Quick, smooth results. And for someone like me who already has somewhat straight hair, the temperature adjustment settings are great! Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My sister and I both bought the same Remington flat iron a few years ago.  It worked out so well we figured we should get our mom one too.  She loved this one.  It turned out to be exactly what the descriptions says and works really well!</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron. my last flat iron cost $250 I dropped it last week and broke the ceramic plate so I ordered this flat iron and it is 10 times better than my last one. it does a great job</li>
    <li> Omg!!!  I LOVE these I was a little nervous while purchasing but when I received them they work wonders on weave and natural hair.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant about this because I&#x27;ve never owned a Remington but my hair is super smooth and shiny. Not to mention the price is great too. Love it!</li>
    <li> I mostly use this straight iron to create soft-beachy curls in my hair.  I love this iron and like how the buttons are recessed into the side so I don&#x27;t push them on accident.  Easily compares to my $100 Solia iron!</li>
    <li> I have spent so much money on hair straighteners over the years - I can&#x27;t believe that one so cheap works so well, but it does :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it does exactly what it says it will and I have natural hair and my hair is perfectly straight with one pass</li>
    <li> I rarely iron mostly because I fear the damage. I really like it though</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have to buy pricey products. It&#x27;s really practical and quality beside affordable.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing straightener. It heats so fast and straightens so well. I love it. It&#x27;s a total game changer and would absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product and I&#x27;ve had it for quite some time now. I wish the heat would go on a lower setting tho. I have to run it thru quick or it burns my hair off or freys my ends.</li>
    <li> One of the better online purchases I&#x27;ve ever made!</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this item. When it arrived, it came in a plain box. It wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Not what I wanted but it will work for the gym. I wanted a smaller size to fit in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> I tried this flat iron on my hair and thought it worked great! I really liked that the heating element is far enough away so I don&#x27;t risk buring my scalp. A very good product!</li>
    <li> I like the look and feel of this iron.  The ceramic plates slide right thru my hair with ease.  I am not an expert at it yet, but it seems fairly easy to use for adding some curl as well.  The iron is not that heavy and has a swivel cord if you get caught up in odd areas.  It has a digital display and a + and - to change the temp up or down. When you turn the iron on it starts at 380 degrees - that might work for most, but I do have very fine hair and think a lower setting is better for me.  The lowest it goes to is 300 - which I actually think is just about right for me.  The highest is 450 for those thicker heads. It heats up quickly and notifies you by beeping when it is at the temp you have selected.  Overall - it is a very nice iron and seems to do exactly what it was designed to do.  I would recommend this iron to anyone. Marilyn Riggs.</li>
    <li> I replaced my very old, $20 discount-store cheap model Conair 1/4&#x27;&#x27; flat iron with this model.  I have longer, thick textured hair just past my shoulders.  The barrel size works nicely for my length.  I like that you can tune the temperature in 5&#x27; increments.  Initially, I took it up past 400&#x27; and it nearly caught my hair on fire... so be careful!  I use it at the standard 380&#x27; setting and am very pleased with the fast results.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny.  I avoid completely straightening my hair more than 2 times a week though because I could see it being very damaging in the long term.  My only complaint is that the handle is a little thick and awkard to hold at first, but not a major issue overall.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have pretty curly thick hair and don&#x27;t straighten it often because I just don&#x27;t have the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item replaced my old pretty cheap Revlon straightener so its definitely way better!  I started with the auto-set 380 degrees and found I must have \\&quot;harder to straighten\\&quot; hair as I ended up with the 420 setting.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, so I will probably play around with the temp settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quick heat up is awesome and the digital read out is cool. It beeps and has an easy to read indicator to show when it has reached the desired temp.  It&#x27;s easy to maneuver, nice light weight.  I like the fact that it shuts off after 60 minutes in case I leave it on accidentally. I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a flat-iron novice, no expert.  This is a good entry-level product.  I have been able to use it effectively, and people have been telling me that my hair looks good on the days I use it (usually I get no hair comments at all).</li>
    <li> Super quick!  Doesnt pull my hair.  I am so happy with this buy.  I highly recommend.  The price was awesome.  Weird that it arrived in a bag instead of box, but I actually appreciate that.</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron. It heats up quickly and it straightens my hair well. My hair has a natural wave to it and is normal thickness. I have two complaints, first it was wrapped in an open plastic bag and the cord was sloppily wrapped, it made me think that someone had opened it and returned it. Also, the power button does not always work to turn it off, sometimes I have to press it a few times before it will work, however I always unplug it, so it isn&#x27;t a big problem. Over all I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good cheap flat iron, you get what you pay for and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great. It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair, heats up quickly, and makes my hair look shiny and frizz free.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. I am happy with this purchase.It replaced my old hair straightner where the ceramic plates were coming off.</li>
    <li> I liked it when it was new as it is light-weight and heats fast . I disliked the on/off button though as I accidentally kept hitting it while ironing my hair. Now the product has issues with minimal use (under 8 months with 3-4 times/month use). The cord makes a crackling noise and the iron shuts off automatically. Waiting to replace this since still under warranty and will update the review if next one lasts longer!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron seemed like such a great deal, and it was for a second.  Then the buttons to control off/on, heat temp quit working all together! Don&#x27;t know if it go shook around during shipping, but it&#x27;s going back.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron! It heats up very quickly, is the right plate width, is lightweight, and does a perfect job! I would recommend it to anyone, especially that the price is quite reasonable.</li>
    <li> the say it in least this order was very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I received it in dirty condition to an extent that sides were rusty.&lt;br /&gt;it looked like it was used for ages and no one cared about cleaning it before shipping it to a customer.&lt;br /&gt;Generally products i buy from amazon are good but this one sucked to the core.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 12 year old daughter for her birthday, and she loves it.  It seems to do a great job on her hair!!  Very satisfied with our purchase!!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of fine highlighted hair that is medium in length. I have had 4 other flat irons before purchasing this one. I absolutely love this iron!! Heats up quickly, is very easy on my hair and there is no pulling or catching of any hair at all. Highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased.... Control heating very easy to use. Whether you want it for curls or straight. Something about it makes me feel like I got an extremely expensive product for way less. Thanks</li>
    <li> excellent flatiron whoever disagrees is lying!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I already had one I was replacing. Came quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lost count of the number of Remington Flat Irons that I&#x27;ve owned (I loose things).  I would say that, overall, I&#x27;m been consistently content with the quality of them.  This one was not a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a smart looking little instrument, and it performs well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;It heats really quickly, and I LOVED the cute little &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34; it gives when ready.&lt;br /&gt;Digital temperature read out.&lt;br /&gt;Buttons are responsive but not easy to accidentally press (I&#x27;ve had other models that it was easy to turn off or up by accident, or which you &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; you&#x27;ve turned on, only to find you didn&#x27;t press the button firmly enough).&lt;br /&gt;Long swivel cord.&lt;br /&gt;Locks closes easily.&lt;br /&gt;Plates seem to be evenly heated, without major hot spots.&lt;br /&gt;Good grip for hair.&lt;br /&gt;Nice weight (not too heavy, too light).&lt;br /&gt;Good smooth shiny results that don&#x27;t look fried.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to straighten my wavy/curly hair quickly without redoing sections (and had good results on the 390 temp).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;First, while it handled straightening quite well, it did not to well with curling (yep, you can curl your hair with a straightening iron, find online videos for instructions).  In order for a flat iron to curl well, the sides of the plate need to be hot and contact your hair.  I am not sure on which of these details it fails (or if we are dealing with human error), but ultimately, it just didn&#x27;t work well for curling.  Secondly, the digital temperature display (while completely readable) is not as clear as on other Remington products.</li>
    <li> Several months ago my 120 dollar flat iron broke beyond repair and that sent me on a quest for a new flat iron that does not cost $120 because that is ridiculous to pay if its just going to break after 8 years. I spent a lot of time on amazon searching and reading reviews and ended up with this remington and a conair infiniti pro. I had the conair first and loved it initially but started feeling indiferent about it, so when the Remington arrived I was thrilled with the way it looked and how if felt in my hands to use it. This became the flat iron of choice for about a week. I liked the digital read out of the temperature and that the plates seemed to &amp;#34;float&amp;#34; more than the con air but…after I got over the things I liked about it, the one thing I did not like, was just too much to overcome. The plates are not smooth enough. I have very fine hair and need the plates to be ceramic smooth and these have just a touch of texture that might be perfect for other types of hair but not mine. Keep in mind neither iron is as good as the high end iron I had, but like I said I&#x27;m not paying that much again.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this straightener. Ive been using a cheap steel plate flat iron and for the past year have been hating my hair. This heats up super fast and i only have to run it through my hair once. My hair looks healthy and shiny when Im done. Shipping time was great.</li>
    <li> met my expectations! heats up really fast, and makes my hair super straight without much effort. i have very wavy frizzy hair so i needed something that has high heat. It only takes me about 15 min to straighten all of my hair, i have long hair too! definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use a few times works great in my hair, i like the auto heat lock and swivel cord makes it really easy to use. So far no problems here, definitely does its job.</li>
    <li> I recently had to lay my beloved flat iron to rest. Rather, I plugged it in one day and the plug exploded out of it. I needed an iron quickly but didn&#x27;t have the funds for a more expensive item. For the cost I was super surprised at how well this works. I&#x27;ve used big box/drug-store brand irons before with pretty terrible results - died in a few uses, protective &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34; melted away, fried the heck out of my hair. This has done no such thing! The pearl coating is great at protecting your hair from heat damage and the adjustable temperature settings are great for finding your specific heat threshold. I&#x27;ve since purchased a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; iron but do find myself reaching for this one and taking it with my when I travel. Definitely recommend as a supplemental iron!</li>
    <li> I am used to using a Chi flat iron. My chi&#x27;s just have not been holding up as well as they use to, so I decided to get a new one. I saw great reviews on this, and I was not disappointed. It has great temperature controls, and it heats up really quickly. It has help up really well! It also doesn&#x27;t seems to dry my hair out, which is great! Its a really fantastic flat iron for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Especially for the $, heats up in about 60 seconds and I can straighten my hair faster, saves me time! I have long natural wavy hair too, would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Not happy with the product. First it didnt come in the original box 2nd its suppose to warm up in 15 seconds but it took forever and it never beeped. And 3rd it pulled my hair. After 45 minutes i gave up.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to expensive straightners like Paul Mitchell</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great.  I love the digital read out and the auto shut off.  It heats up very fast.  I have shorter hair and it works wonderfully for smoothing.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful flat iron, especially for the price!  I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing about it.  It heats up fast and I can use a lower heat and get great results!  I was concerned about the buttons being on the side of the iron, as other reviewers mentioned that they had problems bumping the buttons while using.....but, the iron actually has the ability to lock the buttons (pressing and holding the {-} button) and which has made bumping the buttons a non-issue.  I also love that the iron locks closed for storage.  I would buy this iron again!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is fabulous, especially considering the price!  It doesn&#x27;t snag or pull or tangle my hair at all.  It runs cleanly through my hair, gets really hot (up to 450* with a digital thermometer), and the cord swivels, making it easy to curl your hair.  Plus, it heats up and cools down relatively quickly.  The packaging is no-fuss, but who cares?  For this price, this flat iron can&#x27;t be beat.  Really great buy!!!</li>
    <li> The best flat iron I have ever owned! Friends that have used it always inquire where I got it and brand.</li>
    <li> First off, when I straightened my hair with this straighter it didn&#x27;t even hold for 2 hours even with the highest heat setting. Second off, after I showered my hair gave off such a bad smell. It took me 3 days to get rid of the smell. Third off, the Remington logo on top of the straightener rubbed off complete after I curled my hair.</li>
    <li> I have a ton of naturally curly, thick and longer hair.  I&#x27;ve never used a straightener before.  I was impressed.  I used the 380 degree setting as recommended in the directions.  It took me about 20 minutes to completely straighten it.  I thought it would take much longer consider how much hair I have.  I dont see myself doing this all the time as it will absolutely kill my hair but I&#x27;m loving the smooth and frizz-less locks I have right now!  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I brought this straightener because I was desperately in need of a new one and really just wanted something that does the job. It was shipped in a nice box with the straightener in a tube of plastic. When I ripped off the plastic the sides of the straightener had marks and key like scratches. That was disappointing. On the bright side the straightener heats up really quickly! The lowest it will go is 300 degrees and the highest is 450 degrees. The heat display is a glowing blue which is kind of awesome and the buttons to increase and decrease the heat are displayed nicely. Overall does a nice job on straightening. I just wish the heat setting could go lower, and that it wasn&#x27;t scratched up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I was iffy about the straightener at first I think im beginning to like it more. I read the instructions into depth - it actually gives helpful tips on what heat settings you should use depending on your hair type and ways to see the best results. My hair was straight after the second run through with the straightener and there was no frizz. I think it just takes some getting used too. I still don&#x27;t like the appearance of the scratches on the nice white and black sides. However, it is a pretty good straightener once you get used to it.</li>
    <li> This product had great reviews and a good price so I went with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I receive the product in a sealed bag in just a box, no product packaging. Even though the cord still looks originally wrapped, the product looks used and not new. There is a small chip on one of the heating plates, scuffs on the matte rubber, and scuffs on the metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even in try to use it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually do a lot with my hair in terms of heat, but sometimes you just have to straighten out the &amp;#34;ponytail kinks&amp;#34; from your hair! This is a great, inexpensive straightener that heats up fast and beeps when it&#x27;s done heating up. I&#x27;ve never changed it from the default temperature and it works great on my very thick hair, so I can straighten it in no time!</li>
    <li> Ok, so here is my story of great stupidity.  I bought this because I was in need of a new iron.  I got it, turned it on and used it.&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t know what that 450 degrees is too hot to use on my hair.  I burned my hair.  The last inch of my hair was completely singed in two days.  My stylist had a fit.&lt;br /&gt;Now I set to 360 and it is perfect.  So, if you have fine hair, turn it down and it will be wonderful.</li>
    <li> Value for money. The shape of it is great and very easy to use, but the iron is not ceramic... Would not buy it again ;(</li>
    <li> My daughter is going into Cosmotolgy school, and absolutely LOVES this item. It leaves hair soft, and no fly aways! Perfect!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for our granddaughter and she says it is better than the one I have.  It heats up fast and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I love it works great went threw my hair just one time ..very happy with it</li>
    <li> I bought this product March 5, 2014... and I loved it. The perfect size, temperatures and worked magic to my hair and my sisters, who by the way have a challengeable hair. Well a week ago, the iron was 450 degrees and it melt its self and burn my hair. I have tried many things but I hate my hair now. I guess that you van only use this product for a year... what I&#x27;m trying to say is be careful. If you notice anything out of place don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Purchased as a gift for my hairdresser. Now I want one for myself. It is hot and smooth. Didn&#x27;t get too hot when near scalp like other products.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and straightens hair easily. Hair always looks smooth and shiny after straightening. Lasts for the whole day.</li>
    <li> This straightener works great! I have long, thick hair and it easily straightens all my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! It does NOT make your hair frizzy and does not tug on hair..just glides through! It is great for creating curls, so easy!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! I had previously purchased the older model of the Remington Pearl. It lasted me well over 3 years with no issues! It still works great! I decided to upgrade to the newer model. Before buying a Remington straightener I was using the CHI straighter brand and it seemed every year I was having to spend $100 on a new straighter. The CHI brand would not last. After reading reviews I purchased the Remington Pearl and I could not be any happier with it. My new Remington Pearl Pro straightener is even better than my old one! I love it. I have very think, wavy , and long hair and straightening it can be a pain! The Remington Pearl Pro makes my thick hair soft, straight, smooth, and frizz free! Love it! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as expected for my fine hair. Gets VERY hot and I found myself turning the temp down. Heats up very quickly and has a nice long cord. The beep that signals that it&#x27;s ready isn&#x27;t very loud, but I don&#x27;t really rely on it since it heats up so quickly. Great for the price and would purchase again without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Light weight yet straightens hair beautifully. Also is small enough to do my bangs. Love digital reading for temp and ease of changing it.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read some of these reviews before I purchased this product. I have been looking for another straighter for a while to check out but not break the bank. This model had great reviews on a few sites for the cost I thought why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No it fully shows that these are nor ceramic plates and make my hair look dull, dead, and flat. Horrible straightener!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning it today</li>
    <li> i purchased this item because a family member of mines had it , i used it And feel INLOVE . RECOMEND .. Love How it Leaves Your HAIR PITCH STRAIGHT !! :)</li>
    <li> Great product for the money..Product heats instantly and it serves it&#x27;s purpose. I highly recommend this product to everyone.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Because it was 110 V and I live in France and its 220 V I should&#x27;ve bought it from amazon France. And the plug doesnt work in France. So I cant use it !! Its still in the box. And it came without a bag or a small purse . My cousin bought it from amazon.fr and she got a bag for it !!</li>
    <li> Only had it a short time and used it twice but it really does heat up in 30 seconds which is GREAT. Works like a charm. So glad I didn&#x27;t pay $100 or more for one of the salon brands.</li>
    <li> I just got this flat iron four days ago and I have been very impressed, I would recommend this product. Heats up fast, does a great job, and I&#x27;m done in 10 minutes or less with my hair.</li>
    <li> The product is all what I expect. Great flat irons at a low price. Leaves the hair soft with sheen.</li>
    <li> I purchased mine from Wal-mart in store about 2 months ago after reading all the reviews on Amazon on how good it was. This iron is close if not the same as using a Chi iron in my opinion. I am African American and have thick shoulder length hair. The iron goes up to 450 degrees so that is the temp i use on my hair. Again, because it is thick and it thins my hair out so well. I use TRESemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Spray 8 fl oz (236 ml) and a thermal protector. The steps I take are: I wash and blow dry my hair after a regular Shampoo and Conditioning. Then, I part my hair in four sections spray each section, (about 4 to 5 mist pumps per section) secure each section and then blow dry each section. I allow the thermal protector to sit on the moistened section for at least 5 minutes prior to blow drying. After all the hair had been fully dried, I spray each section again with the thermal protector (about 2 pumps per section) and secure the four sections down again and begin my flat ironing starting from the back of the head and working my way to the front. I saw a video on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;FDqsXzs6PoU) explaining to use a comb to separate the hair to get a more straightened look for thicker hair texture and for me it works better than not using a comb or brush. I will post another review after i have had it a year.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this flat iron. It does exactly what I was wanting, for a very reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and works well. Not as good as a high end flat iron but its not nearly as expensive. It will do 90% of what a CHI will do for a third the price</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this and it works very well thus far.  She hasn&#x27;t complained.</li>
    <li> i bought this hair iron in the last week and the product looks dirty and used, the packaged it was already open. furthermore, the main problem is when i try to use it start up and after 3 minutes shut off.</li>
    <li> The way it heats up so quickly is great, the white part is so shiny with the pearl infusion part. It takes me such a short time to straighten my hair, and it&#x27;s thick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy that finally there are flat irons, under $100 bucks, that ACTUALLY work &amp; work WELL!&lt;br /&gt;With 3 females under one roof, the financial impact of make-up, styling products &amp; tools can be extremely stressful.  I want my girls to have products that protect their hair &amp; styling tools that don&#x27;t dry out their beautiful hair or create lots of frizz, &amp; split ends.  So, I&#x27;m really, really happy when I find high quality products that we can all share.&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I&#x27;m ECSTATIC when I find high quality AFFORDABLE products that I can afford to buy 3 of so that we don&#x27;t have to share!  This is one of those finds.  It&#x27;s frustrating when my girls take things out of my room, like my make-up, hair products &amp; styling tools, &amp; I have to go on the hunt to find MY things before getting ready in the morning.  SO, when I can afford to buy more than 1 of something we all like to use, it creates a much more relaxed environment because I&#x27;m a happier mama!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great for the price. I like the fact that  it gets hot, really hot and has an automatic shut off I believe after an hour and you can program it to turn on at a certain temperature. It also looks very nice with the black and white color, looks like a high end flat iron. However, after a few uses, it doesn&#x27;t seem as hot as it did when I first purchased it. I also like that the cord is long with a swivel on it making it easy to maneuver with out getting the cord all tangled. All in all, good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using for several weeks now and love it!  Heats up quickly and I only have it set at 360*  Very hot.  Easy to clean the ceramic plates.  I also like the auto shut off feature.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. The round barrel really helps me get curls in my short to medium hair. Hears up quickly and I get good results on a relatively low heat. Quite pleased!</li>
    <li> This heats up quickly, is easy to handle and has a good choice of temperatures.  it is comfortable to hold and easy to use.  My hair looks almost as good as when  my hear dresser does it when I use this flat iron.  I think it&#x27;s a good price for a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an old school hair straightener for about 10 years.  Wow!  I had no idea how far these have come.  This straightener is first and foremost:  fast!  Lightening fast.  It heats up in 30 seconds.  It also straightens quickly because it&#x27;s so hot.  I love the digital temperature read out.  You can adjust the heat to any temperature - if you always want the highest setting simply hold the control down and it will automatically set at 400 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long, thick, and wavy/curly and it does not straighten easily - it&#x27;s even resistant to salon keratin treatments.  This made it straight and shiny and beautiful - so straight, in fact, that when I tried to add some curl back in to make the ends wavy it wouldn&#x27;t hold.  I love it.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve really liked this straightener. I have long, thick, wavy hair and it works perfectly for me. I usually use it on 400 degrees.</li>
    <li> The Remington S9500pp Pearl Pro Ceramic Flat Iron, 1 Inch size, uses floating ceramic plates that are safe for your hair. There is a digital temperature control which I really like as my last flat iron had no way to control heat. This is very important so you don&#x27;t fry your hair! It only takes 30 seconds to heat up and uses &amp;#34;turbo heat&amp;#34; to get to the highest setting. It is just the right size and fits comfortably in my hand making it easy to use. It also has a 60 second shut-off which makes it safer in case you walk away and forget to shut it off...but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing that as you never can tell what would happen. Overall, I found this Remington flat iron comparable to my old Ch flat iron which was my favorite for a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this flatiron for my fourteen year old daughter after she over-worked two previous flatirons (What can I say, my teen is slightly OCD about her hair looking straight and sleek).  It was a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*  Heats up super fast.&lt;br /&gt;*  Plates slide over hair.&lt;br /&gt;*  Leaves hair smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;*  In expensive.&lt;br /&gt;*  Sleek design.&lt;br /&gt;*  Easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* The autoset temp of 380 is a bit too high for finer hair.&lt;br /&gt;*  It emitted a nasty smell the first two times it was used.</li>
    <li> It is a good value for that price. But if you want a better iron, you will have to spend more money. For me it is fine, cause I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair and it is already straight.</li>
    <li> this has to be the best straightener I have ever owned. it heats up supper quick and makes it easy to get your hair done in minutes</li>
    <li> Received the flat iron on time...,The flat iron was in a clear bag w/ the instructions then inside a plain box! I&#x27;m a big fan of Remington and I purchase there products relgularly so I know there packing style THIS WAS NOT IT! The plates on the flat iron were chipped and the name Remington on the top faded once I headed it up. I&#x27;m a BIG fan of Amazon but have always seconded guessed buying from other seller.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this flat iron was at my aunts house and I loved it. It is not only great for straightening your hair but it works wonderfully for curling it as well. I will for warn anyone that uses it. You DO NOT need to use it at the highest setting. I bought this product because my $100+ flat iron was dying even using at the max temp wasn&#x27;t working on my hair. So like a dummy I used this product straight from the package at 450 degrees and it burnt my hair. It is one week later and there is still a slight smell of burnt hair. So please be careful starting out with this straightener and always remember to use a heat protectant on your hair. Otherwise this is one of the best flat irons I have owned!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it because it is too big for the length of my hair.I didn&#x27;t check the  size of it before I  bought it, so it is really my fault.But it is a good flat iron.</li>
    <li> AMAZING HAIR IRON! AND SO CHEAP. HEATS UP IN 30 SEC AND ALSO GIVES GOOD CURLS. DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON ANYTHUING ELSE</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron to replace a chi straightener that finally burned out, and I really like the way it works.  The positioning of the buttons make it easier to use the iron without inadvertently switching it off, and the digital display in the handle is large, clear, and let&#x27;s be honest, it&#x27;s kinda cool.  I have not used this iron very much because, to be honest, I also purchased The Perfector at the same time, and it does such a great job on my hair that I don&#x27;t NEED to use anything else most of the time.  This iron is a very nice back-up for those days when my bangs are being even more obnoxious than usual and need a strong hand to get them in line, but other than that I&#x27;ve barely used it.  So far, it works wonderfully, and is a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> My flat iron that I&#x27;d been using for years finally stopped working so I had to get a new one (I straighten my hair about once a week). The reviews on this flat iron were great so I bought it and I am ecstatic I did. This is an amazing flat iron. It straightens my hair even faster than my old one and leaves a nice shine to my hair. It snags on small strands of my hair every once in a while, but my old one did that as well so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. This is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Amazing and at such a great price!</li>
    <li> I have curly and thick hair, are very picky with my flattening irons but this one is great!!!</li>
    <li> Great styling tool! Heats up quick and straightens well!</li>
    <li> Just as described, very easy to use, heats up pretty fast. Just that since I live in Australia the plug doesn&#x27;t quite fit the power points here so had to find an adaptor. But that wasn&#x27;t so bad. Overall excellent product, would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Just got this iron today and was so excited!! It was cheap, and has all the best features you can get! Fast heat up, inexpensive, and straightened my hair in literally 6 minutes!!! It&#x27;s never been so straight in my life.  I recommend this 100%.  There are no flaws.</li>
    <li> Picked this one up for my girlfriend who saw this same exact product at Ulta. She wanted it and I found it cheaper here on Amazon so naturally, with my Prime membership, we chose Amazon as our seller. It all worked perfectly and my girlfriend couldn&#x27;t be happier. She wanted one that was ceramic but not expensive, which this one is. She wanted one that was skinny as she doesn&#x27;t have thick hair, which this one is. And lastly, she wanted a flat iron that did not have a dial for heat control as she claims those always tend to break. This, I can happily say, does not have a dial for temperature control. It uses 2 little buttons with a &amp;#34;+&amp;#34; and a &amp;#34;-&amp;#34; and she adds that this one doesn&#x27;t risk burning her hands which is a definite plus!</li>
    <li> I have REALLLYYY curly hair and it gets the job done in 20 minutes if not less.. I had the older version before I got this one and I&#x27;m so glad I upgraded. I love it</li>
    <li> This straightener works well, heats up quickly, and is a great price! Has lots of heat settings - I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> 5 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;30 second heat up time is very convenient for touchups&lt;br /&gt;Attractive design and digital temperature readout&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight design and swivel cord helps avoid arm fatigue&lt;br /&gt;Long plates make straightening longer hair much easier&lt;br /&gt;Shuts off automatically after 1 hour for when you forget to turn it off&lt;br /&gt;Keeps hair straight and frizz free even on humid days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked really well and was way faster than the old one I had. The long plates worked really well. I thought I needed a wider one for my long hair but really the longer plates were what helped.</li>
    <li> This is a must have &amp; for the price.. I will order another one! My only problem is, the one they shipped me.. looks it something someone else already returned and i can clearly see why.. (it doesnt close all the way on its own) but its not an issue.</li>
    <li> It heats up in under 20 seconds, then beeps when it&#x27;s done. It doesn&#x27;t glide as smoothly as I would have liked, but it straightens quickly.&lt;br /&gt;A problem with it is how hot the outside gets. You would have to wear gloves to use it for more than a couple of minutes.</li>
    <li> I use this great 1 inch flat iron every time I straighten my hair. I prefer this width over 2 inch flat irons and feel it is easier to use. This flat iron has nice buttons and a precise temperature control. I also like the rotating cord at the base of the unit that keeps the cord from twisting up while I am using it. It seems durable and well made and I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> The Remington flatiron is well constructed and does a good job of straightening hair. The positive thing is that the temperature can be controlled and it is readable. This is good for the hair. There are so many flatirons that do not indicate the temperature. I find this to be a major positive. However, it is a bit heavy and somewhat difficult to hold together especially with smaller and weaker hands while straightening the hair. Nonetheless, I would recommend it. Please note- these comments are by my daughter who straightens her hair everyday.</li>
    <li> It works as good as it says it does .my hair stays frizz free longer then when I used to use my other straightener .I love it</li>
    <li> It does its job gets the hair straight or you can also curl your hair with it too. It does not have the smoothest glide which i didn&#x27;t expect considering the price. I got it for $23 which seems fair because it still is over all an adequate straightener. It does smell a little bit however the smell is not too overpowering and i have a feeling it will fade away as time goes by. I would say if you are looking for a miracle product with professional quality this is not the product for you. It is a good basic straightener that I would recommend for someone who&#x27;s just looking for a straightener that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+long cord&lt;br /&gt;+it has a screen that shows the temperature&lt;br /&gt;+extremely fast heat up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-smells a little bit&lt;br /&gt;-does not glide as well as promised</li>
    <li> good product with paking.</li>
    <li> The functions of this flat iron are great. The LCD display is easily readable. The flat iron beeps when desired heat has been reached. Not to mention the flat iron quickly reaches maximum heat. The functions are great but the flat iron usage is a let down. The flat iron plates pull at the hair strands as it does not glide smoothly. Out of all the flat irons I have tried this one has been the most dehydrating to the hair.</li>
    <li> Love the fast heat up time and the range of temperature settings to choose from.  Leaves hair soft and shiny not frizzy and dry!  The longer plates are awesome and the rounded edges allow a variety of styling on various hair length.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. Gets hot fast!</li>
    <li> Used item first night I received working well so far. Love the fact that it displays temperature so no guessing games. Has a slightly cheap look but doesn&#x27;t take too much away form the overall product just hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> Steaightens my hair really fast! And my hair stays straight all day (my hair usually gets all curled up once I go outside)</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that is straight as a board, so I bought this straightener to curl my hair (which to me, says more because if you can curl your hair with a straightener, than you can straighten your hair with one). Having this said, the straightener curls or straightens my hair like a charm! It does everything it is suppose to and more.&lt;br /&gt;It came nicely packaged, it is very affordable, has a stylish appearance, and works as it says.The straightener heats up in a matter of seconds, but the beep it makes when the desired temp is reached, is very quiet so if it&#x27;s something you are going to rely on, you may not hear it. If you are looking for a good straightener that gets the job done and is affordable than this is the tool for the job.</li>
    <li> Great lenght, weight and fast heat</li>
    <li> One of the best hair straighteners I have ever used! The price of the product makes it even better! I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Love love love this straightener. Works great and makes my hair look shiny.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It wont flatten hair snug between the plates&lt;br /&gt;-Maybe its just me but I found it to be uncomfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;-it didnt stay on when I tried using it&lt;br /&gt;-Didn&#x27;t feel hot enough in my opinion but it does reach 400 degrees&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it after a week because if felt cheap and didn&#x27;t give me the results that I had been looking for, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for thicker hair textures</li>
    <li> Turns off on a regular every time I use it</li>
    <li> Great iron for a very good price - love that it&#x27;s digital!</li>
    <li> I had a chi which I bought for $120 and this straighter is much better. The chi made my hair lifeless and dull and very dry over time. I&#x27;ve had this straighter about 6 months and its amazing. You can adjust the temperature and it makes my hair so smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Works good so far (using it since 2 weeks)</li>
    <li> Good product. No problems with is. Great for curling hair (I already have straight hair) and heats up really fast. I would recommend it especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for a terrific flat iron.  Works great.</li>
    <li> spectacular, just what i wanted</li>
    <li> One of THEE BEST flatirons I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I plan to buy at least a couple more.</li>
    <li> Heats up within 30 seconds, gets the job done. Typically used around 340°. There is a lock mode so it doesn&#x27;t turn off on you. Just hold &#x27;-&#x27; the minus sign for a few seconds and a padlock will show on the LED screen to let you know its locked. This way it wont turn off or re-adjust by accidentally pressing a button while in use. The cord swivels, which is cool. Other than that, it&#x27;s a solid product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron , it&#x27;s even better than my chi air flat iron . My hair is very course and it straightens perfectly . I perfer this flat iron over any other brands hands down and it&#x27;s a great price</li>
    <li> 1.Cheap&lt;br /&gt;2.heats up really quickly&lt;br /&gt;3.slick look&lt;br /&gt;4.lock features&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that scares me is that whenever it&#x27;s plugged in my lights start to flicker. Now you might say that it&#x27;s the voltage but I checked. It a the same one as my old flat iron and that never happened with it.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron, heat so fast which is great to stylish you hair quickly.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and have a hard time finding a good straightener. My Chi finally gave out on me, but I didn&#x27;t have the money to spend on a new one. So I did my research and finally decided on the Pearl Pro. I&#x27;m glad I picked this one. It&#x27;s just as good, if not better, than my Chi and it was a great value. I strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Item arrived fast and was what I expected.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had this for 2+ years and it&#x27;s still going strong!  I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for a while and use it almost every day. It replaced my $185 GHD flat iron which broke after a few years. The GHD is 6 times more expensive than this but definitely not six times better. My biggest complaint about this iron is that it doesn&#x27;t stay super-hot while you&#x27;re straightening, so you may need to take periodic breaks to let it get back to its original temperature.  PROS: -Inexpensive -Swivel cord -Nice digital display -Quality and performance are acceptable  CONS: -Definitely cannot maintain a temperature of 450 while straightening -Takes a while to heat up -White plastic edge and buttons look cheap</li>
    <li> When you first take the flat irons out of the box , you can&#x27;t help but be impressed by the sleek, professional look it has. Pretty sexy. It didn&#x27;t take long to heat and you can adjust the temperature setting. I tested a few strands of my hair, without any products and I have to say it straightened it pretty well. My hair is typical African American hair. So you know a flat iron is good when it can straighten your hair with no assist. I did purchase some heat protect ant so I can&#x27;t wait to see how it does at its full potential. Plus $23 is not bad for this sexy product. I squealed at how great it looked lol</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! Really smooth glide on your hair(no snagging). Got one for myself and my mom tried it and loved it and I just ordered her one today! We both feel like it kept out hair straight longer. We had previously been using the Jilbere Paris iron. I think we both like this a lot better!</li>
    <li> I have type 4 hair. I love the temp locking feature.  Straightened my natural hair on 400 degrees.</li>
    <li> Wanted a smaller/thinner flat iron for the hair around my hair line. First time I bought a used item from Amazon. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have had GHD&#x27;s for year&#x27;s, but the pins on the plug snapped off, so I needed a cheap alternative until I could afford to replace them, but these are so much better than my GHD&#x27;s, I would bother spending all the money on them now, I can do my hair so much quick and get a better result with these!</li>
    <li> Came undamaged, looks exactly like the pictures, the description is completely accurate and only took like 3days to arrive</li>
    <li> Love it and Received it really fast</li>
    <li> just received this product yesterday.. used it this morning and i absolutely fell in love.. great buy for the money</li>
    <li> Love it. I&#x27;ve even dropped it a few times and it still works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and very timely! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a dual voltage flat ?</li>
    <li> Gets hot quick and straightens very nicely gives it&#x27;s a professional shine</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron and 100% satisfied that I purchased this product. It heats up in less than 30 seconds and gets my hair bone straight. My hair is long, thick, coarse, and curly and usually cant get it straight unless I use salon grade flat irons. This pearl ceramic leaves the hair soft and shiny unlike other products. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend and thank you thank you for selling this finally pulling out my Asian roots.</li>
    <li> It works very well for making hair pin straight in a flash. It may just be my hair, but if you&#x27;re looking to do more with it(curling, etc.), make sure you have some kick ass hairspray next to you. Great flat iron, great price.</li>
    <li> Had this straightner in the past.. and after it stopped working I always thought abiut rebuying it. . Have tried other brands and models but I hadnt been finding the same results from this Remington straightner. . I decided to purchase and I have to admit it works just like a remember..</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to get this because firstly the price, I am used to people saying for their wonderful straighteners that they spent well over $80, but I wanted to try it out since there were so many great reviews. I have very long, thick and naturally curly hair, and this definitely gets your hair very straight. It&#x27;s lighter weight, and I think pretty good quality for the price. I like that it can go up in temperature as well. I would definitely recommend this - I don&#x27;t generally ever write reviews, but just had to with this.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron. I researched them for a long time and most of the good ones seemed to cost almost $100.  After reading so many positive reviews, i decided to give this a try before spending lots of money on a more expensive one.  I have very thick, naturally curly / frizzy hair.  I need a lot of heat to smooth or curl my hair.  This flat iron has a temperature control which is good and even on my tough hair, it smoothed out the frizzies very well.  In addition to making my hair straight, I experimented with giving my hair some controlled wave.  The 1 inch size is perfect for adding just a little wave without making my hair too big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid of the price.  If you are looking for an inexpensive but good flat iron, this is a really good option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that was odd, and I didn&#x27;t see it anywhere in the description, was that this iron didn&#x27;t come in its own packaging or with any paperwork.  It was only sealed in a bag inside the amazon shipping box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy I gave this flat iron a try!</li>
    <li> Normally when I use a flat iron to straighten my hair, instead of going through the whole process of blow drying and straightening then instyler to finish, my hair doesn&#x27;t have any bounce.  It usually comes out rather stiff and not completely straight.  When I used this flat iron (and only the flat iron) you would think I did the whole process.. my hair looks and feels like I blow dried it and my hair came out even straighter than when my hair is first relaxed.  I will definitely be telling all my friends about this flat iron!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a quick replacement for my T3 Single Pass when it started to die (after 4+ years).  I have thick, unruly hair and will not leave the house with my hair down unless it is straightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons in comparison to the T3: The plates didn&#x27;t touch as closely when closed so it didn&#x27;t press the hair as well.  I had to go over each section at least twice and it occasionally snagged my hair (still not painfully though).  The handle also heats up very quickly so I&#x27;d advise you to be careful or spend a few extra dollars and buy heat resistant gloves to use in conjunction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros are that it had the same results as my T3.  It still left my hair very shiny and straight without damaging it.  I kept it on the highest setting and locked it and had no troubles with the placement of the controls as it seems other people have.  The design is sleek, but I don&#x27;t really care how it looks.  The swivel cord is always a bonus.  It heated up quickly and it still took only 15 minutes to complete from turning it on to finishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it will last 4 years like my T3 did but for the same results at 100$ price difference, it was worth purchasing.  It is also still better than a CHI!</li>
    <li> Girlfriend love it. Settings are great.</li>
    <li> After almost 10 years with my last Remington, I figured I would stick with the brand. Glad I did. Heats up super-quick, glides easily through my hair. There is the peace-of-mind factor with the one hour shut-off, no more getting to work and worrying all day if I unplugged the flat-iron. I&#x27;ve actually used it 5-6 times per week for 2 months and have cut my straightening time in half. Love it!</li>
    <li> This straightener is mega value for money! I ended up getting the black and white one, which is different from what is pictured here, but I prefer what I got. It looks more classy and mature than the pink. Anyway, to the functionality - It is durable, heats up quickly and stays at the heat you put it thanks to the lock function. I&#x27;m an African with super porous 4c hair and it helps me keep my hair sleek when I wear it straight. Be careful not to turn the heat up too high though, especially if you have soft and fragile 4c hair like me. I keep it at the lowest heat setting.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is better than the $180 GHD I bought before the Remington. Returning the GHD and using this one exclusively!</li>
    <li> So far it works really good! Straightens super fast leaves my hair shiney but not to shiney. It also heats up very fast.</li>
    <li> I have thick and coarse hair but it works pretty well for the price.</li>
    <li> Works great on my fine hair. I use it often with no problems.  It heats up fast and it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair straightener, warms up very quickly, the automatic shut off is great. It keeps your hair super soft, and the LED screen is great. Perfect straightener for everyday.</li>
    <li> I have had my 2 in Chi for 7 years and just wanted something smaller for my now shorter hair. I loved using this straightener for the month that it worked! After one month of everyday use one of the plates started smoking and no longer heats up. Extremely disappointed that I now have to go back to purchasing expensive straighteners if I want them to last. If you purchase this item you&#x27;re taking a gamble as to whether it will hold up or not.</li>
    <li> After comparing many different flat irons online, I decided to buy this one because of all the positive reviews and its reasonable price. But I suppose it is true that you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;I just received this straightener and went to test it out. It heated quickly, but produced a weird chemical smell once it was fully to temperature (I set it to 340 degrees). I have A LOT of fine, medium length hair that air dries flipped out in all different directions, hence the need for a straightener. I tested it on a few different sections of hair- some small, some large- and it pulled my hair every single time I got to the ends. I tried clamping it harder and softer, no difference. It also made my hair very static-y.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, not impressed with the quality and I&#x27;m not sure what the other reviewers are doing differently to make it work well for them. I will be returning it and trying out something a little more expensive.</li>
    <li> This is the first flat iron every purchased/used in our home.  There has been a lot of experimenting and a few failures, but mostly successes.  I really couldn&#x27;t say how this iron might be improved.  The quality seems great.  The results on my wife&#x27;s and kids&#x27; hair are perfect.  I just can&#x27;t figure out why I would spend $50 or $150 more on a product that gets the same results as this budget version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on other reviews, there may be a question as to its durability, but ours is going strong with what I would consider heavy use (wife and two girls on an almost daily basis).</li>
    <li> LOVE this flat iron! I was using an older, hand me down flat iron that belonged to my daughter and I just thought I was doing it wrong. I got this new flat iron and I absolutely love it! My hair is soft, shiny and stays straight all day with very little frizz. I highly recommend this flat iron. Tip: a lot of people complain about a burning smell or the iron catching in their hair. First, get a good heat protectant (I use Chi) and when you are done with the iron, run the blades over a damp washcloth a couple of times to remove the build up of products.</li>
    <li> Love how quickly it heats up and the great price I purchased it at!</li>
    <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> My hair is pretty straight already, but this does a good job making it look even straighter. I also don&#x27;t ever feel like I&#x27;m frying my hair when I use it, which is definitely a plus.  It heats up fast, is easy to pick what temperature you want, and the swivel cord is great.  Overall well worth the few dollars I spent on this.</li>
    <li> Always buy Remington, great features and super quality!</li>
    <li> easy to use and light weight. heated up very quickly(30 sec.). straightens my course african hair in 1 stroke. i would recommend</li>
    <li> Great.  works just as well as more expensive flat irons.</li>
    <li> I got it August 22 and now it won&#x27;t even turn on. It lasted only a couple months and it wasn&#x27;t even the best straightener. My hair isn&#x27;t hard to control but after straightening my hair in the morning, by mid afternoon it wouldn&#x27;t be straight anymore. Just spend the extra money and get a good one that will last instead of wasting your money on this one and having to buy another one as well</li>
    <li> Best hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. Works awesome on my thick curly hair. I love Remington products and I&#x27;m very glad I bought this one</li>
    <li> The place to hold straightener if you want the option to curl your hair is really short.  The heat is really hot on this flat iron, so placing my fingers there doesn&#x27;t feel safe because I think it will burn my fingers. I wish the design would have made the top portion longer for the placement of the fingertips or more heat-resistant.  Beside that, I curled my hair with it once without heat protectant on 380 degrees and it stayed curled for the whole day, and more looser the next day.  I do like this product despite me being scared to burn my fingers off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now. I like that it has a swivel cord. Also this flat iron has a lock to keep it closed for storage. It heats up fast and has a button to lock your heat setting in place. It also has Led screen to show the temperature and beeps when ready. I gave it four stars because it still takes a few passes to make it straight. It also seems to get dirty quickly with styling products.</li>
    <li> I bought this once at a retail store. It worked great but it just stopped working after a few weeks. I returned it for a refund and decided to order the same model on here a couple months laters, thinking that my first experience was probably a fluke. Same thing. Just stopped working after a few weeks. Remington replaced it for me and it&#x27;s been working for a couple months now. I like it, but having it break on me 2/3 times is not good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing and leaves a lovely shine. Really fast to heat up, and sometimes leaves my hair too hot to touch for about a minute (you can use lower temps, but my hair is stubborn so the higher heat works best). Anyway, I love this more than my sister&#x27;s $100+ straightener!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my little sister. She loved how it made her hair look and how easy it was to use. The only downside was that it turns off regularly while she&#x27;s straightening her hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE this straightener!!!</li>
    <li> I have had my eye on this flat iron for a while but for some reason I never purchased it. But im glad that i finally did. It gets super hot instantly! This got my hair super straight on the first pass but I did a second pass anyway and my hair turned to silk! On my coarse, dense hair 420 was too hot. I got nice results at about 380-400 degrees. Idk what hair type needs to go any higher in fact I would avoid the highest setting. The only con is the smell. Idk if it was because its new or the products i used but it had the salon burnt tool smell. I dont think i damaged my hair though. Hopefully it goes away. I would recommend trying just because it a good price but the quality it worth much more!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best flat irons I have had! I had a previous Remington which was great, but this is even better. I have short hair so getting close to the scalp is important to me, and this does a great job without making the hair static-y and unmanageable.</li>
    <li> It is working good. But after a 2 weeks of use the lock has broken.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for about a week and so far it&#x27;s been really great! It beats up really fast and does a good job straightening my hair. I don&#x27;t have really difficult hair so it works well. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> Straightens my natural hair great! Gets nice &amp; hot fast &amp; leaves hair shiny straight!</li>
    <li> JUST DID MY HAIR / WORK VERY GOOD</li>
    <li> I burned myself with this flatiron; I think it&#x27;s difficult to grasp with only one hand.  I need one with a stay-cool tip to hold.</li>
    <li> Being under back stage lights and heat, people dropping tools. This iron is a champ! I spend so much on my styling toolls and thought I&#x27;d try this out!&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is it&#x27;s better than any 2-300$ iron Ive purchased!</li>
    <li> Works great and heats up fast!</li>
    <li> Good serves and good stuff</li>
    <li> I have really(!) thick, wavy, coarse hair, and I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding a flat iron. I need something tough enough and hot enough to smooth my horse-tail mop, but gentle enough to leave it still healthy. Thanks to the Pearl Pro, I&#x27;m done searching. I compared this iron to a ceramic Chi, a Revlon with vibrating plates, and another (lower priced, metal plated) Remington model, and this one came out on top. The Remington has a heat sensor that signals when the iron is hot enough. The plates are quality, and the iron simply gliiiiides over the hair, leaving it silky and truly, honest-to-goodness straight. The Pearl Pro is at least as good as the Chi (maybe even better, since my hair feels less fried now), and it totally leaves the Revlon and the other Remington in the dust. Before, with them, I had to go over each section of my hair at least twice, and I could never get tresses totally tamed, but with the Pearl Pro, one pass is enough to completely subdue the wave and leave my hair absolutely straight. For someone with really coarse/thick hair who doesn&#x27;t have $100+ to spend on a flat iron, this tool is heaven sent. I can finally approximate the look I get at the salon. Love, love, love it to pieces!</li>
    <li> I rated Remington Pearl Pro ceramic flat iron 4 stars because it is a good flat iron. I like that it heats up in seconds and it is easy to use. The 1 inch is a good size, although the 11/2 inch would be quicker but not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a nice flat iron that smoothes my friezes and slight wavy hair to a smooth, shiny finish, just make sure you use heat protection like Tresseme or another heat protection because the 400 degrees can damage your hair!</li>
    <li> This flat iron heats up super fast and the heat stays consistent. This is great whenever I tackle my naturally curly hair. The plates resist product build-up. With the width of the plates, this iron works best on 2-5&amp;#34; length hair. It is also comfortable to hold, easy to use and the plates slide easily. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> What I liked most about using this flat iron, was all the compliments I got, versus when I used my old flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used the heat setting that came on automatically (380) though it is supposed to go up to 400 degrees, but if I don&#x27;t need it that hot I like that I can choose a lower temperature and save my hair from over heating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design was light and easy to use. The swivel cord made for a nice addition my old iron didn&#x27;t have. It really made my hair look smooth and soft even without using any anti frizz serum, like I usually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really glad I gave this iron a try, it was a great find.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it does, my hair looks great after I use this flat iron.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have owned!! My hair would get frizzy no matter how many times I would put my old flat iron to it, and with this one I have no more frizz!! works wonders with my thick hair also my mother&#x27;s thick hair!!</li>
    <li> I have very very thick and long hair. My hair is naturally wavy. I wanted to try something different and didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune to get it done at the salon so I picked up one of these. I must say this is a very good product. I must use it at the higher temperature of at least 440 degrees as I do have stubborn thick hair but it works great. It only takes a few minutes to straighten my hair to my liking. My hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be drying out and doesn&#x27;t seem to have any damage after using this. Some others said they have a strange smell in their hair after using this but I didn&#x27;t have any issues and I&#x27;ve used it several times now.  I am very happy with this product and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> After years with my CHI - the first time I used this - I put the CHI away and haven&#x27;t taken it out again since.</li>
    <li> AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING. I can&#x27;t believe I only spend about 20 bucks on a professional quality flat iron. I am Afro-Carribean with THICK CURLY AND COILY hair bout a 4 a/b/c for those looking for a flat iron that is SLEEK, APPEALING and easy to use and truly leaves there hair STRAIGHT, SILKY and has SMOOTH PLATES. This is an absolute steal! I will be buying the iron again if I have to make a choice to every buy a new one lol. I am obsessed. It its nice, use digital coding for the heat and heads up in less then 30 seconds. The only sad thing is that the remington name has started to smudge since my hair requires a good amount of product after blow dry, heat protectant and hold spray. Tried a few curls they came out BEAUTIFULLY. This flat iron is FANTASTIC. Thank you Remington!!</li>
    <li> Best straightener I have ever owned! I had the older version forever it seems like and finally upgraded after many years and I still love it!</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected. I have used Remington flat irons before. Great.</li>
    <li> I love! i have tried the Conair Infinity Pro but this is definitely a better one! If you are looking for a straightener that doubles as a curling iron you have found a winner! i love this straightener so much! First off the look of the flat iron is beautiful! it looks very classy and sleek! I love how the numbers are digital and the black and white makes it look like a high end and very expensive flat iron! there is no need for a chi or a nume iron this Remington is all you need! I love that you can lock the iron shut for an easier storage! i love how you can lock the heat temperature so you dont even have to worry about accidentally touching the temperature buttons because you have the option of locking it down. It is extremely smooth and very nice for tight curls, soft waves or straight hair what ever you like it works! By the way i have thick black full hair! so dont worry about that! Overall i just love it! And i recommend you buy it too!!!</li>
    <li> ermagerrrrrrrrrrrrrrd! such awesome! much waaaaaaooooooow!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing flat iron. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Best straightening iron especially given the price. Very modern and sleek looking. It beeps when it&#x27;s ready and you can lock the temperature. I love that I can set the temperate lower given my level of heat/bleach/dye damage and it straightens my loose curls/waves in one go.</li>
    <li> I have has a chi for 8 years and I have been missing out. I love my Remington! It&#x27;s gets hotter than a chi and it tames frizzy ends. I wouldn&#x27;t buy another chi if it were the last straightener on earth. I definitely recommend this straightener to anyone looking for one.</li>
    <li> heats up so quickly and makes ahir smooth and shiny</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and works just as well as some of the high end irons I have used.</li>
    <li> Still I don&#x27;t know how to use it but Good product! I need to practice.</li>
    <li> I already had a Remington hair straightener that still works! But I wanted one that i could use I curl my hair and his is amazing for that I used it as soon as I got it! And I love it it heats up fast! And I like the way is curls and straightens hair it left my hair shiny. My hair never got caught in it and I have very frizzy thick curly Native American hair! My hair was not frizzy after using this at my hair kept the curl, which for some reason is hard for it to keep even though it&#x27;s curly! I would suggest this product to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Works really good!&amp;#34;  says my wife.</li>
    <li> Works well, good value!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift. Used twice and has got me good feedback on the ease of use, less passes required, built quality, no burning of hair et al. Durability will come later, maybe in 2-3 months</li>
    <li> I have bought $150-$200 flat irons. NEVER have I used one that has been this amazing. It does not pinch my hair, it does not leave me with split ends, it doesn&#x27;t get too hot to burn my hair. Its is perfect! It is fast to heat up, smooth to hold and gets the job done in record time. I would give this flat iron 10 stars if i could! Never will I buy another kind of straightener. *Thumbs up Remington Pearl!!*&lt;br /&gt;Update on December 28, 2015: It has been almost 2 years since I have purchased this hair straightener. Still amazing. Warms up within 30 second and stays hot all the way until I am done.&lt;br /&gt;The beginning of 2015 I accidently left it on once I left for work one morning and ran back at my first break and it was off. So it even automatically shuts off after an hour or so of inactivity. Smart on the manufacturers part!</li>
    <li> Corresponds exactly to the product delayed.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;Works really well... Take care of your hair. Straighten them perfectly AND quickly :)&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it Ofc!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is AMAZING!!! I had my past flat iron for 6 years and it only worked half as good as this one. It makes your hair shine and smooth with one run through. Make sure to read the product info for the temperature you should have the flat iron on for your type of hair. If the iron is too hot for your hair type, the iron dries out the hair.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a new flat iron for a while, when I came across this one. I was skeptical, but I LOVE it! I constantly forget to turn my straightener off so the fact that it has an automatic shut off is a huge plus. It heats up quicker than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used and it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like the last one that I owned. It&#x27;s hot, smooth and lightweight. AND the ceramic plate is long so that I can straighten more of my hair at once. It also has a rounded edge, which makes it easy to curl hair as well. I would definitely recommend this straightener to anyone.</li>
    <li> I used it once so far.. I used it on 340 to start because I was scared to add heat to my natural hair but it straightened my hair pretty good so far.. next time i will up the temp and not be chicken lol.. but I did do a few curls with it just to test how it looks and I liked how my hair looked. I love the fact you can lock it so you don&#x27;t change the temp or anything while curling, I love that you can lock it closed so it lowers risk of getting burnt or even for easy storage, I love how fast it heats up and that it makes a sound when it reaches the temp desired, I also love the swivel cord and the ease of use!! If anything changes I will update this. But so far great for the price :)</li>
    <li> This is the first straightener I&#x27;ve bought and it&#x27;s amazing. Heats up really fast, and the temperature setting is really cool. Would highly recommend; great for its price.</li>
    <li> The last flat iron I bought for my daughter lasted about 10 days, this one is going strong at several weeks now. She uses it a lot, at least once a day. It hangs nicely and has an auto off. It packs decently into a travel bag and it heats up very quickly. She has really been enjoying it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that this flat iron would heat up so quickly, but indeed it did. It seemed as if it took less than 30 seconds. I like the temperature setting. I also like that I didn&#x27;t burn myself easily as I have with another flat iron I own. The whole apparatus stays nice and cool when the heating element is on (and wow it that hot!)  It&#x27;s a good weight. The only gripe I have is that I couldn&#x27;t tell if the thing was actually on or off when I hit the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; button, so I unplugged it. Not a big deal though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that I will mention, that is not specific to this model is that I think if one has hair that can be straightened using a brush and a blowdryer, that&#x27;s a better choice for the health of one&#x27;s hair. I thought my hair was being damaged by using an old flat iron that had no heat setting, so I was looking forward to trying this one. Even when using protectant spray (which you simply must use!) and the recommended setting for fine hair, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that straight irons do too much damage. But, that&#x27;s me. If you have a lot of thick unruly hair, go for it. This model will do you fine.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this iron. It is easily the best one I have ever had, and I&#x27;ve had a lot. It heats up in under a minute and allows you to go REALLY straight. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE! This flat iron does wonders on my extremely thick hair! It gets hot really fast and beeps to let me know its ready.. It get my hair soooooo straight with so much shine! I love this iron and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it! It arrived on time too!</li>
    <li> As a hair dresser I recommend getting a GHD iron for your hair.  But this is a great back up iron for building hair pieces and working on clients who don&#x27;t need a major straightening job.  This guy heats up fast and is true to the temps you set it to.  For the price, you&#x27;re getting way more than you&#x27;re expecting.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron so I can only compare it to my old curling irons.  This product is well made and I do like these features - swival wire to allow tangle-free twisting, LED panel with temperature adjustment so you can change the temperature setting depending on hair type, 30 second heat-up with a beeping alarm when ready.  I use this flat iron to curl my bob inward and to straighten one wayward curl that always sticks out.  It works well.</li>
    <li> daughter loves it.. heats up quickly and has a digital read-out</li>
    <li> 0 stars. When i got my package, the flat iron was black and pink and the one above is clearly black and white. Completely different style, but it was still a remington brand iron so i decided to go ahead n give it a shot, i mean it cant be too much different right? Well one of the plates didnt heat up at all. Waste of time and waste of money. I am not impressed.</li>
    <li> I didnt like it .it didnt work for my hair to much of waste. For so much money!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. I have shoulder length chemical treated hair and it works nicely.</li>
    <li> This straightener is great! I have long, thick hair which likes to be wavy and slightly frizzy.  This straightener takes care of that in no time! It&#x27;s compact, sleek, and has those little extras like a cord that swivels at the base, and no little, annoying dials or knobs. Especially for this price, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just received my &amp;#34; what I thought is a brand new flat iron&amp;#34; and I was surprised that when I opened it the iron seemed to be used, the display and all the front part is lightly scratched and in the end it seems to have the plastic scratched as it i had been knocked with a hard surface.</li>
    <li> Heats up very quickly, works great with my hair! Moves smoothly across my hair and does not pull! Great for the price I paid!</li>
    <li> This was a great buy for the price. It heats up quickly, holds heat well, and turns off quickly (great for curious kittens). I have shoulder-length hair that is fine but thick, curly and wavy, so finding a way to straighten my hair such that it stays straight has always been difficult. I condition my hair every other day and my hair stays silky smooth and the ends don&#x27;t feel dry at all. Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair!!</li>
    <li> I was really excited for a decent priced straightener that had a nice look. From the one time I used it, I liked it. Heated up fast and the plates didn&#x27;t stick or pull my hair. I am sad it just stopped working... I thought it was the outlet but it didn&#x27;t work in any, at my house or my neighbors. Sad! Had to send back and decided to go with a different straightener.</li>
    <li> This thing gets SUPER hot, which is what I was looking for. It&#x27;s what I need to get my hair as straight as I want it. Fits my needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to buy this flat iron because I&#x27;ve only ever owned a chi and I have very thick and wavy hair but my chi went out and I couldn&#x27;t afford to spend $100 on a new one so I took a chance on this flat iron and I&#x27;m so impressed. My hair is straight as a board!</li>
    <li> What a fantastic straightener!  It heats up so fast.  Works great.  I can even curl my hair with it.  Very versatile.</li>
    <li> A wonderful tool for everyday styling or touch-ups! I can&#x27;t believe the looks I get with a simple 2 min. style. It&#x27;s easy to use on my hair in the back. Quick warm-up is a big plus!</li>
    <li> This was a great product and I love using it. The adjustable temperatures are great, but it does a great job at 370. Definitely worth the $22.</li>
    <li> Great straightener. I had a chi that worked well but died quickly and wasn&#x27;t worth the money in my opinion. This one is great, quick heat up, easy cooldown, adjustable, rotatable cord, locks into place, and straightens very well.</li>
    <li> So the hot part gets hot, which is definitely the point of a hair straightener. However, the problem with this straightener is that the outside of it gets hot too. I have burned my fingers countless times, and I keep telling myself that I will just get used to it. Its about two weeks later and I am still burning myself. You can&#x27;t touch the area behind the plates and the low profile of the edges doesn&#x27;t protect your fingers either.</li>
    <li> heats quickly and straightness well.. my hair is very light.. for that i have to use max heat,... i think its not suggestible for thick hair.. for me it works ok..</li>
    <li> Great :) my mum uses it every day</li>
    <li> Purchased this straightener after my old one broke. I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money on a new straightener so i decided to go with this one. I have purchased Remington in the past and I have never had a problem with the way they work. This straightener is perfect! I have had no issues with it. It straightens perfectly and the temperature is good. For the price and quality, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> and makes for easy , efficient flattening. Makes the hair shiney too. Personally, I prefer the 2&amp;#34; irons, gets the hair done quicker and just as efficently</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for the price. Heats up quickly. Small enough to travel with, but big enough to do the job. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have coarse hair with extremely tight curls and overall I would say that the flat iron gets the job done quite nicely. However I did take a star away because I feel like it is scratching my hair after the second pass... I fear the scratching/pulling will eventually result in breakage. With that being said I won&#x27;t be using it often.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener for all types of hair. Currently both my roommate and I use it on a somewhat daily basis. I have thick, wavy, and somewhat frizzy hair and it will straighten it quickly and the hairstyle will last. My roommate has very curly but thin hair, and it also works amazing on her hair as well. Plus when needed it is also good at curling hair if you know how to use it right.</li>
    <li> Best straightner I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> This has to be the best flat iron I have ever owned. I have very curly hair that I do embrace and I love but sometimes you just want to change it up!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through many brands and styles and widths this is by far the best. The adjustable temperature is a great feature, the lock switch to keep it closed while you set it down AMAZING. Over all this is the best flat iron out there in my opinion</li>
    <li> Love it a lot! Hair looks perfectly straight!</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s other one broke, bought her this one and she loves it.</li>
    <li> This iron works great, heats up quick and leaves my hair smooth and shinny</li>
    <li> It came before the shipping date and I&#x27;ve had it for months now and it hasn&#x27;t been making any smells or anything and still works great for the most part. Only thing that sucks is the lock broke after a couple uses. No biggie I just wrap the cord around it when I put it away anyways.</li>
    <li> The iron was thrown in a box with no product info .This iron has fried the ends of my hair, even on the lowest heat.I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron to replace my old one that had given up on me. (It was a random brand name from TjMaxx) I have naturally curly hair, so it can be hard to straighten at times. While this iron did straighten my hair, I had to pass over each area a few times. It also felt like it was pulling on my hair while I was using it. I&#x27;m used to an iron with slightly heavier plates that my hair just glided through. I think I will be returning it just because of how uncomfortable it was to use.</li>
    <li> These are probably the best flat irons I ever bought and the cost less than the overly extravagant flat irons, it protects my hair and leaves it soft and silky I have two of these flat irons just in case one breaks I have a second one on hand.</li>
    <li> i have naturally straight hair that is chemically permed.  when my hair is curly it is to my bra.  it reaches right above my jeans when i straighten it.  when my hair is wet, it takes an hour to straighten.  when it is dry, it takes 1/2 an hour.  my hair does not burn or smell like it&#x27;s burning with this flat iron.  it gets super straight,  no kinks, and lasts all day and night.</li>
    <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Hearts up great and fast and stays heated too. Also love that you can lock it so that the straightener stays closed.</li>
    <li> Heats up super fast, does a great job in no time. I had an Andis for years and when it played out I bought this instead of another Andis based on all the good reviews. It was definitely the right choice!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this item on Amazon and this item arrived in a plain brown box and looked used. So I returned and purchased from a local store. I love Remington products and love this Remington flat iron! I have no complaints about it!!</li>
    <li> Great quality and value</li>
    <li> The box was a simple box. Seemed cheaply made once I tried it I knew it wasn&#x27;t for me. I will spend a little bit more and get something better.</li>
    <li> Got this for my sis in college and she is very unhappy. Leaves hair frizzy. You don&#x27;t even get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Cheaper then Walmart. Worth it!</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a year. Still works great and nothing went wrong. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic flat iron! It heats up quickly and lets you know when it is completely heated (it beeps). The display is easy to read and aesthetically  pleasing. The flat iron is easy to use, and the 1 inch ceramic plates are of high quality. When you use it, it does not tug or pull on your hair, it glides over it like any good flat iron should.I have had more expensive flat irons before, but this flat iron is better than my previous ones!  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a flat iron before, but looked at a few and their reviews before buying this one.  It works great and the cost was FAR less than some big name brands.  Heats up quickly and has adjustable temp setting so I don&#x27;t fry my fine hair.  Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll have to say that this is probably one of the best affordable straighteners I&#x27;ve had. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and i&#x27;m extremely impressed. Before with my old cortex straightener, I had to make sure I passed through every strand of hair multiple times but with this one I can take a big chunk of hair, straighten it, and not be bothered! This thing also gets super hot as well. I used to have to use 400 degree heat but now i can use 380 degree with this. It never snags on my hair either and I love it&#x27;s sleek design and how fast it heats up. This is also great if you sometimes forget to turn your hair tools off because of its automatic shut off. Would definitely recommend this to anyone in need of an excellent and affordable hair straightener!</li>
    <li> No rating because i could not use it in australia, have to go through the painful, process of returning the iron and the hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I ordered these flat irons on June 30th and got them on July 2nd YESSSSSSS fastest delivery I&#x27;ve had. I used them immediately and I LOVE them already..they heat up fast and I dont even have to change the heat setting from the original temperature its hot enough on 350 it came in a nice box with plastic in the inside..no scatches or anything wrong like other ppl stated in some of their reviews..perfect love it thanks Remington !</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I recently returned a more expensive straightener I had also&lt;br /&gt;ordered from AMAZON. I&#x27;m so glad I found this one! At this price, I may order a few for back up, and one to keep at my parents house for when I visit!&lt;br /&gt;This straightener is lightweight, glides well through the hair and it&#x27;s very attractive! I&#x27;m not into the neon pink and chevron patterned flat irons that are targeted to the younger girls. This is a nice non-embarrassing styled flat iron that a 35 year old can be proud to show off!</li>
    <li> Love this!  My wife loves it!  She can&#x27;t believe how well it works for the price.  And the best part is it shuts itself off.  If you don&#x27;t buy it for the price buy it for your marriage...lol.  You don&#x27;t have to wonder whether it got unplugged ever again and you can quite racking up the electricity bills!!</li>
    <li> The best Flat Iron I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and works wonderfully!  So glad I made this purchase.  Heats up to 450 degrees quickly.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I turn it on, grab my hairbrush and supplies, and when I am ready to start, so is the straightener. It heats up so quickly. I have very fine hair and it glides right over with no issues or pulling. I like that you can adjust the heat setting. The plastic area on the outside of the plates does get a little warmer than I would have hoped, so I keep my hands strictly on the bottom portion. Easy to curly with the round edges. Cord tangles less than most straighteners I have had.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works okay, but I feel like the description is dishonest—the plates are NOT ceramic. They are metal plates with some sort of black paint covering them. You can see this is the case because there is a small scratch on one of the plates (see photo). Maybe the black part is a thin layer of ceramic, but I feel like a true ceramic iron should have real ceramic plates, not metal plates with a &amp;#34;ceramic&amp;#34; coating. As such, I will probably be returning this iron and exchanging for something higher quality. I&#x27;ve noticed this to be a problem with cheaper flat-irons, so it&#x27;s something to be aware of when you&#x27;re shopping around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the digital temperature controls are nice (works in 20 degree increments), and the iron beeps when it is fully heated.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works just like a chi</li>
    <li> horrible product...have had this since April and it started smoking and making sparks...all of a sudden one plate stopped working... I read the reviews and that&#x27;s why I chose this particular straightner. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Best flat I&#x27;ve every bought! My hair only would get this straight with a beautician until these bad boys. I also thought to get  these results like this I was going to have to spend money.......Great Price. Love the flat iron, Love the price, &amp; Love my HAIR!!!</li>
    <li> This straightner is the best one ever!!!! I am African American and It make my hair silky smooth and I have gotten a lot of compliments❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> I got this before dying my hair and it was perfect. But after i dyed my hair (red) it started to stop gliding as well as it did. But whatever pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought my first one at Ulta and after loving it my cousin always wanted a straightener but couldn&#x27;t get one if she&#x27;s only 13. She wants a fast straightener so after loving this product I got her one too! Fast shipping :)</li>
    <li> Larger than I expected which turns out to be a good thing.  Heats up really fast. Leaves  My hair with a nice shine.</li>
    <li> Nice straightener for the price!!!</li>
    <li> perfect perfect perfect</li>
    <li> I have straight hair so I really only use this when I&#x27;m going to a formal event. But it heats up really quickly and I can touch up my hair with just a few strokes.</li>
    <li> my wife I will charm you.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! It heats up very quickly and allows me to straighten all of my hair quicker! Great deal for an awesome straightener!</li>
    <li> Such an amazing product it makes my curly hair pin straight, looking healthier then it did before flat ironing it, and keeps it straight all day. So happy with my purchase !</li>
    <li> Over a year later, this thing still heats up super-fast and the plates have not worn out.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron &amp; such a reasonable price. My previous flat iron had died &amp; needed one right away. I haven&#x27;t had any luck with flat irons from the drug store &amp; price wise  - a Chi or Salon flat iron was out of the question. So I read reviews and I&#x27;m so glad I choose this one. Heats up quickly and no hair frizz! Easy to handle so you can even do beach waves with it. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This little iron works better than my expensive one.  I originally bought it to put in my camper but after using it I put my high dollar one in the camper and brought this one in.  Straightens hair in half the time and I love the digital buttons.  Perfect for my long hair.</li>
    <li> Does a fantastic job on my hair</li>
    <li> This item is a great product. I have relaxed/transitioning hair and it does a great job straightening my hair. I normally have an issue with straightening my hair but this product has made the process easier.</li>
    <li> I use this about every day and love it. It does get very hot and i have burned myself but i figure that is kind of to be expected</li>
    <li> Works great and at a good price</li>
    <li> BEEN VERY PLEASED SO FAR !</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron so I am not an expert but I like it. Warms up quickly, does an excellent job with straightening my hair (shoulder length hair in max 5 min), easy to use, light weight, beeps when it is ready to be used. I like the simple but elegant design. Occasionally, (mostly when i don&#x27;t pay that much attention to how I hold it) I feel like that it pulls my hair if it goes over the edge of the plate. Leaves my hair shiny and smooth, no burning smell. I use flat ironing spray before I do my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It gets the job done.</li>
