      <li>The color is beautiful, kind of a honey-blonde.</li>

      <li>It looks good</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be good </li>
      <li>as good</li>
      <li>very cute, doesn&#x27;t attach well on the scalp</li>
      <li>the pros are its beautiful color length and how easy it is to brush...</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this wig!</li>
      <li>I love this wig!</li>
      <li>but i love the look while it&#x27;s on!</li>
      <li>This wig wasn&#x27;t great quality, but fit well.</li>
      <li>The wig itself is nice quality.</li>
      <li>It is nice for pictures or a costume</li>
      <li>BUT that&#x27;s a good thing (nothing a pair of scissors can&#x27;t fix), and to top it all off no one</li>
      <li>It came with a wig cap too which was also nice.</li>
      <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a nice wig</li>
      <li>If it had been delivered I&#x27;m sure the product would&#x27;ve been good.</li>
      <li>The material is good though and it&#x27;s easy to brush.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay on very easily either.</li>
      <li>I have about 15 wigs and this is the best one by far.</li>
      <li>but honestly I have too many brown wigs already</li>
      <li>It would be nice if there were more hair for the the wig.</li>
      <li>super happy with this wig and would reccomend it as a great starter wig (or even for a well seasoned Lolita).</li>
      <li>Was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t look very good but was very surprised when I opened the box!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to see the liner through the top if the hairs are shifted out of place.</li>
      <li>However, since I&#x27;ll be using it often, I&#x27;m going to have to dye it or tone it to be able to use it.</li>
      <li>This would probably be best to layer on top of shorter blonde hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a light,milk tea sort of blonde/brown.</li>
      <li>I love that texture of the hair</li>
      <li>Maybe a darker wig would have been a better choice.</li>
      <li>Im sure I ordered an X&amp;Y Angle wig</li>
      <li>Better than any of the wigs I saw at the Halloween store.</li>
      <li>IT is a great wig, and looks real and lovely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to have to add more wefts to it.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love this wig...</li>
      <li>It made my face have this healthy glow.</li>
      <li>I had hopes of wearing this for more than cosplay</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a bit more curly than wavy, but I might just need to brush it out some more and let it hang.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I was very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s ok..</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>great wig delivery was fast coming from China</li>
      <li>but is regardlessly adorable</li>
      <li>Considering it was only $20 with shipping, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is an adorable wig.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would recommend if you got food to feed these cute attachement</li>
      <li>But it works for the purpose that I&#x27;m going for, so I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
      <li>love the color, though it is a bit darker than the picture.</li>
      <li>i actualy like it better than my $60 arda</li>
      <li>Of course she can&#x27;t wear it when she goes to school:-)</li>
      <li>This seems more like a thicker version of a costume shop wig.</li>
      <li>I used a hair straightner to straighten the wig and it worked, it is heat resistant and it straightened it pretty well!!!</li>
      <li>This is such a beautiful and amazing wig.</li>
      <li>Both are beautiful wigs, soft and took under a month to arrive.</li>
      <li>( it&#x27;s a very beautiful color throughout), the bangs were a tad long</li>
      <li>Pretty good.</li>
      <li>but it looks very nice Highly recommend</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was really impressed by this wig!! especially for the price.  I had to cut some bangs into it so it could more natural.</li>
    <li> It came in, super beautiful, very soft I would rate it 4.5 because it&#x27;s not as full as it seems but it looks very nice Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Love the wig, but the crown is a bit thin and you can see my hair if I don&#x27;t constantly fix it just right. It doesn&#x27;t stay on very easily either. Overall pleased though price matches pains.</li>
    <li> Delivered 16 days prior to my expected deliver date, so defiantly some points there. Came in Ziplock bag without any type of &amp;#34;X&amp;Y Angel&amp;#34; tag, but that didn&#x27;t bother me. The color I got was a dirty blonde, just a bit darker than the picture, but still very pretty. I have short dark hair so I wanted something drastic and this is. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5 and the curls come mid-chest. The top of the wig is thin, you can see my hair/wig cap under it, and the part isn&#x27;t natural but thankfully it&#x27;s winter and I can wear a cute beanie cap or some thick headbands/scarfs to break it up a bit and make it more natural looking. But, for this price i&#x27;m not upset about it being thin at the top, and didn&#x27;t mind grabbing some headbands or whatever to spruce it up. The only negative thing I have to say is that the actual inside of the wig isn&#x27;t that big. I&#x27;d say I have a normal sized adult head and it doesn&#x27;t fit/sit right. i&#x27;ll have to bobby pin the heck out of it to my wig cap to keep it from slipping back. So in my opinion it&#x27;s defiantly not a once size fits all, and I can&#x27;t even imagine using the size clips to make it smaller unless a child was wearing it.</li>
    <li> It was too thin, too shiny, fake looking and just horrible..</li>
    <li> next to no hair in this wig...</li>
    <li> The color is more yellow than pictured, it seems almost cartoonishly blonde</li>
    <li> Wig is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;It didnt arrive in time for halloween, but you can be a women of questionable morals with this wig any day of the year!&lt;br /&gt;It came packaged tightly sealed into plastic bag with this cute boy inside with it!&lt;br /&gt;Pic related&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend if you got food to feed these cute attachement&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely enjoy this wig</li>
    <li> I love this wig so much it came early its super soft has a little shine but its more of a healthy shine not cheap wig shine minimal fall out fits perfect i actualy like it better than my $60 arda</li>
    <li> This wig is absolutely gorgeous do not regret buying it!</li>
    <li> Pretty but tangles far too easily and no matter how careful you are,  it thins out within a few wears.</li>
    <li> The wig I received is very full and soft and would be beautiful except that the wig is yellow! It is not a shade of blond but is exactly the shade of the yellow gingham pillowcase on my bed. I read the reviews of others and it seems the shade a person receives is hit or miss. The seller was very nice about it and gave me a partial refund but I will be giving this wig to my granddaughters to play dress up with. I wish I could dye it because other than the color it&#x27;s the best wig I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> Ok... It&#x27;s really nice and looks natural but the hair keeps falling &amp;#62;.&amp;#60; i wish it didn&#x27;t keep flaking off. and the top part where the bangs should be... if you don&#x27;t fix it properly you can see the hair net.. It would be nice if there were more hair for the the wig.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gorgeous!! But a tad bit thin in the top and bangs are super long but cut them and you&#x27;ll be good </li>
    <li> A little thin, but the color is very natural and very similar to the photo.</li>
    <li> Looks real! I just wish it had a little more volume. Other than that, it&#x27;s one of my favorite wigs ^_^</li>
    <li> Very pretty but messy. It tangles easy and doesn&#x27;t look very realistic (It is a bit shiney). You can see through parts of the wig if you move the hair a certain way. It is nice for pictures or a costume but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it out.</li>
    <li> I love this wig...the pros are its beautiful color length and how easy it is to brush...con it sheds quite a bit and I had to trim the bangs</li>
    <li> I love this wig! I&#x27;ve ordered expensive and non-expensive wigs before and the quality of this one is pretty good. Considering it was only $20 with shipping, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the color, though it is a bit darker than the picture. It&#x27;s more of a light,milk tea sort of blonde/brown. The hair itself is very soft,it&#x27;s super long, and the top closure is seamless. I&#x27;ve had issues with the underwire/cap showing through but I&#x27;m glad to see this one was perfect. They even through in a wig cap for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides I can see are that the hair is a TAD bit shiny. But that&#x27;s nothing a little dry shampoo can&#x27;t fix. Be careful when brushing this one, I had a few hairs come out but that&#x27;s nothing new about wigs and extensions in general. The curls don&#x27;t last very long, so I would suggest setting them with a hair spray right away or using a low heat setting. I have yet to use heat on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So awesome wig for the price! I&#x27;ll definitely be wearing this one for as long as I can and will be back to order more from the seller. Fast shipping, too! (:</li>
    <li> The wig I received is platinum blonde, not at all like pictured. It fits tightly but makes my head look weird. I am going to be using it on a mannequin but I am very disappointed in the difference in color.</li>
    <li> The wig itself is nice quality. Soft, thick enough to hide the hair net. The curls are pretty and don&#x27;t come out when brushed. It does lose hair quite often &amp; easily though. The color is also not accurate in the photo. My wig is definately yellow compared to the cool blonde the photo shows, so it looks super obvious that it&#x27;s fake. For a cosplay or 1 time costume, this would be good. However, since I&#x27;ll be using it often, I&#x27;m going to have to dye it or tone it to be able to use it. The bangs are also too long to be forehead bangs (they cover your eyes completely), but too short to be swept to the side. As a result, I had to cut them, as another reviewer also said she did. All in all, it&#x27;s a nice wig but I&#x27;d be hesitant to buy another.</li>
    <li> Lovely color, really soft and easy to care.</li>
    <li> The wig I received didn&#x27;t have the X&amp;Y Angel tag attached to it, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a fake. The hair was ridiculously thin, and a fake, unflattering yellow blond. The bangs had to be cut quite a bit just to fit my face, and even then the wig just looked terrible. I&#x27;m not too upset since it was so cheap, but buyer be warned- it&#x27;s extremely hard to order through a seller that will give you the genuine wig.</li>
    <li> This is such a beautiful and amazing wig. Its adjustable and hides my black hair really really well. The wig cap it came with is perfect too. It is a couple of shades darker than in the picture but in my case thats what I was hoping for. It was came really curly but nothing a little straightening couldnt fix. Love it! Also very fast shipping. Came in less than a week!</li>
    <li> Very pretty wig, great quality..just a little darker than I thought it was going to be but that&#x27;s ok..it&#x27;s something different for me.but I do like it.</li>
    <li> this brand of wigs is perfect for costumes and dress up! the bangs are an issue on all three I&#x27;ve gotten. i trim them and pin back the excess if needed. i couldn&#x27;t see wearing them full time they tangle super easy and i find them itchy even with a knit like pantyhose but thicker wig cap. but i love the look while it&#x27;s on!</li>
    <li> This is a good quality wig especially considering the price but the color is a dirty blonde and doesn&#x27;t really look like the picture. Also, the bangs are auper long. I may end up using it anyways if I trim it up a bit. Either way, this is the only company I will but wigs and hair pieces from on amazon. Just know that this piece is not true to the picture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased  a wig before and was scared from reading all the comments about other sellers and wigs....I was so relieved when i opened my package. It looks like real hair, it&#x27;s not shiny or cartoony blonde.</li>
    <li> The bangs are too long but it&#x27;s alright. It&#x27;s not as pale as it seems, it&#x27;s actually more blonde. :/ Not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping but nothing like the photo, it has so much bangs that it looks like a mullet when you wear it</li>
    <li> The wig is nice but its sort of thin and tangles very easy and looses curls easily</li>
    <li> The wig is beautiful, but very small, almost the size for a child.</li>
    <li> It only took less than 20 days to get here. The wig isn&#x27;t as blonde as I hoped but still cute.</li>
    <li> Pretty sure it is a knock off and not a real X&amp;Y wig, which usually has decent wigs. This one had a bright sheen to it that made it look very fake. Even with my short hair, the cap didn&#x27;t fit around my head so beware if you have long and/or thick hair bc it won&#x27;t fit around it when you pin it up. The hair on the wig is very sparse and the cap shows through with the slightest turn of the head. As someone else mentioned, the bangs are not stylish and extend too far back, almost even with the front of your ears, making it look like a mullet.</li>
    <li> This was good enough for costume purposes, but the top was a little thin on hair and you could see through.</li>
    <li> First it didn&#x27;t come as the color is said, then when I tried to dye it. Didn&#x27;t work, then adding any heat when the product a said it was heat friendly fried the wig. Thank goodness it was only 20 bucks.. I wouldn&#x27;t buy another wig from them. The month wait was certainly not worth it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the wig on February 9th and it arrived March 10th, which I was happy about because the earliest arrival date was March 6th.  The wig comes in great condition considering it was shipped. It is really long and comes curlier than the image shows, but it is a very pretty wig. I&#x27;m posting pics. The bangs were long, but that was okay because I wanted to cut them straight across like the image shows. I actually ironed it (on the lowest setting) and it did not melt or burn. Overall, I was very happy with my purchase. It wasn&#x27;t expensive and was really nice.  Can&#x27;t wait to wear it for my costume!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep it simple.. It looks very natural, not too shiny and fake looking. It is exactly as in photo. Great quality. Thank you!</li>
    <li> After being disappointed by a bunch of blonde wigs that turned out to be red, it was a pleasant surprise to get this gorgeous blonde wig! :) It is a little bit darker than the picture but it&#x27;s more natural sandy looking. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great wig, it took a while to get it but so cute and worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Holy cow, where do I even start?! This is a terrible buy! It took over 4 weeks to arrive and when it did, the product was just awful! I understand that you get what you pay for and I really wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this! DO NOT BUY THIS! I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THIS!! It&#x27;s extremely shiny and it just does not look natural or pretty. WASTE OF MONEY! It wouldn&#x27;t even look good with a costume on Halloween!</li>
    <li> Love it !!!! Looks natural I love it I total buy this wig again I like the I love that texture of the hair</li>
    <li> So if you look at a lot of X&amp;Y ANGEL reviews you&#x27;ll see a lot of them talk about color variations between pictures and product so I&#x27;m not going to go too much into that part. If you have the XYO36 blonde wig from this seller that&#x27;s pretty close to what you should be expecting color wise. I store those two close together and this one is just a few shades lighter. Color situation out of the way let&#x27;s get into the rest! It arrived on time and lovely as every wig I&#x27;ve bought from this seller the only difference aside from the color thing I mentioned was my wig was a little curlier than expected but that was easily solved by a few passes of a flat iron so it definitely lives up to the heat resistant title. The wig itself is very beautiful and soft giving me no real serious trouble with tangling, brushing, or just staying nice. It&#x27;s overall a really great wig and if you don&#x27;t mind the little bit of color variation (I added a picture to show what I mean so you know if it&#x27;s too drastic for you) then you should definitely give it a try.</li>
    <li> it was a gift for my sister and she loves it she wears it every where she goes. she styles it too</li>
    <li> Doesnt look like the one in the photo. It&#x27;ll do though. Maybe a darker wig would have been a better choice.</li>
    <li> The bangs are way too far back on the wig, it looks like a bowl cut with hair hanging under it.</li>
    <li> I used this wig for a Taylor Swift costume for spirit week at my school- the look was inspired by the 22 video- Very high quality wig for the price- I have about 15 wigs and this is the best one by far. It is incredibly realistic although a little thin in the back- but i had to wear a hat anyway so it was fine, and I wish that the wig cap was a different color. The color is pretty close to the picture but a little bit yellow. Other than that it is great and hid my long dark brown hair really well! My bangs were perfect- I know some reviewers had said that they were a little long- and each wig seems to be slightly different than the picture. Overall, a great wig for the price. Was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t look very good but was very surprised when I opened the box! Will defiantly be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> The wig looks nothing like the picture more like a yellow costume wig that tangles easy.</li>
    <li> Ok it was a little big for my head n it looks Like Barbie doll hair but if u wear a hat its not bad but it dose look like ur wearring a wig if someone knows how to make it look real let me know</li>
    <li> Pretty good. A little thin but very soft and easy to work with.</li>
    <li> JUST got it and the package it comes in is a little sketchy tbh. But I opened it and the wig was so soft, it reminds me of some Sleeping Beauty s***. It&#x27;s kinda on the thin side, but I was already planning on sewing in my extensions I never wear. It&#x27;s really long and it could honestly pass for my real hair. Just kinda thin. Also, the cap is kinda small. So if you have a big ol&#x27; dome, make sure you pin it down.</li>
    <li> So this was my first time purchasing a wig and... I absolately loved this wig SO much. It&#x27;s so soft and not super tangly like other wigs. It almost felt real!! It is pretty thin, but I managed with it. The color isn&#x27;t exactly the same as the picture but it wasn&#x27;t super fake looking. Not something I can go outside with everyday (because I&#x27;m Asian) but definitely for night time outings and dressing up and cosplaying. It came with a wig cap too which was also nice. Overall, I really loved it. I hope this review will help you too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this wig. I was so happy when it arrived that I tried it on immediately. It is true that the color is a bit darker than the picture illustrates; however, I don&#x27;t really see that as a negative. It looks like real hair and is nice and soft. Tends to tangle and knot up easily, but nothing a bit of brushing can&#x27;t fix. I like that it is adjustable and came with a really nice wig cap! Overall, I adore this wig and can&#x27;t wait to order more!</li>
    <li> I really like this wig! This wig is a really nice natural blonde and when you put it on it looks so real! I would defiantly recommend this wig!</li>
    <li> The hair is a dark blonde but VERY realistic in color, not too shiny, and full on the scalp (which is hard to find with wigs). The length is very long and reaches my lower back (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4 for reference) but I&#x27;ve found with long wigs you need to cut off the last 2-4 inches because they tangle easily. There&#x27;s also a lot of hair fallout, but not enough to make it look noticeably thinner. And yes I use a wig comb but it stills falls out easily. Only real complaint is that the lace cap is oddly shaped and takes some rearranging to fit well on my head. Very versatile bangs. WOULD MAKE AN AWESOME CERSEI LANNISTER COSPLAY WIG</li>
    <li> If it had been delivered I&#x27;m sure the product would&#x27;ve been good. But it hasn&#x27;t been delivered. So 1 star because I still expect it at some point.</li>
    <li> Not the color I asked but like it</li>
    <li> Hsir itsrlf is silky and soft, but a . The blond color is somewhat flat though, could use a little warmth or maybe move more towards platinum.  Widh it was dyable!</li>
    <li> This wig arrived at my house earlier than expected (yay!) The color is beautiful, kind of a honey-blonde. It is super soft, and even came with a free wig cap! The only problem is if you are like me and tend to play with your wig while wearing it, it may start to&lt;br /&gt; get frizzy like my little pony hair... but is regardlessly adorable and I receive many&lt;br /&gt;compliments while wearing it with my coords&amp;#60;3. I&lt;br /&gt;am super happy with this wig and would reccomend it as a great starter wig (or even for a well seasoned Lolita).</li>
    <li> Color is VERY wrong. The wig color is dark brown, not blonde at all.</li>
    <li> Nothing like picture can see right through it as there is not enough hair never buying from this place again, buy directly from X&amp;Y Angel like it says above not these shoty places.</li>
    <li> I got this wig for a Misa cosplay. It took a couple weeks to arrive. It&#x27;s my first wig and I was very nervous. But it looked just like the picture. I was able to straighten and style it easily and my aunt said it looked real. My only problem with it is in the back you can see through the wig. Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Great wig waited a little while for it but it was worth the wait! I tried it on and loved it! My hair naturally is long and brown so I wish this came with a nude cap for under the wig!</li>
    <li> I tried to order this wig but ended up with blonde extentions. &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> My daughter (8 years old) wants to have long hair really bad and this wig just did the trick for her. Of course she can&#x27;t wear it when she goes to school:-)</li>
    <li> If you have a child sized head this will fit you perfectly. I wish I never bought it.</li>
    <li> like everyone else said, not too shiny and fake looking.  the bangs are too long for the blunt look, but you could easily trim them or style them side-swept (which also looks great).  it&#x27;s a bit more curly than wavy, but I might just need to brush it out some more and let it hang.  it did just come right out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t believe what high quality it is for the price.  the cheap wigs from the Halloween stores are sometimes more expensive than this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;took exactly 10 business days to arrive.</li>
    <li> seems and feel fake... perfect for Halloween costume...</li>
    <li> I love it. The color seems just a tiny bit darker than the picture. It&#x27;s really well made and it looks and feels freakishly like real hair. You can brush it as much as you like without worries, too.</li>
    <li> The color is a warmer blonde than the picture looks to me. It&#x27;s pretty shiny but I&#x27;m gonna do all the usual ways to take care of that. for the most part it&#x27;s still very good for the price!</li>
    <li> Obviously not my real hair, but for a wig for this price, AWESOME!!! Came earlier than the first possible date given to me, so that was a plus. It is slightly darker than the picture, but that could be for screen color calibration versus lighting in my house/outside. But it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> While I does look like the picture you can see right through to the cap and all the stitching. The hair on top is very spaced out and regardless of how I arrange it I can&#x27;t get it to cover the gaps. Also it&#x27;s very small It&#x27;s not worth the money to ship back so I&#x27;m giving it to my stepdaughter to use for dress up or Halloween with her red riding hood costume.</li>
    <li> I love this wig! Good quality and it&#x27;s very soft and long :^)</li>
    <li> It is a glaringly bright yellow, and does not look like real hair AT ALL. The &amp;#34;curls&amp;#34; stick out unnaturally, and there is not enough hair around the cap to effectively conceal it from view. I was extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> The wig is almost exactly as it appears in the picture, and is incredibly realistic. The hair is soft and shiny without appearing plasticy. It is a little thin, so make sure to keep your hair smooth under your wig cap, but otherwise I have no complaints. I ordered it expecting it to arrive after the con, but it shipped incredibly quickly-- so quickly I was surprised. It arrived in under two weeks. It also included care instructions in English which was a life saver for me.</li>
    <li> Really small and the hair just shreds out on its own. Now I know this was only 10 bucks but I at least wanted it to fit on my head and if it doesn&#x27;t work for girls with a full head of hair I don&#x27;t know who it will work fir</li>
    <li> very cute, doesn&#x27;t attach well on the scalp so i was constantly having to have my stylist fix it for each shot.. but it looked real when in position-  you just cant move with it on</li>
    <li> So I bought this wig twice. First one took a few weeks to get here and looked like the picture and was thin like many other reviewers stated. Second wig came in yesterday and it is a dirty blonde, a bit thicker and has longer bangs that seem styled to the side. Both are beautiful wigs, soft and took under a month to arrive. They  look very realistic but again, the seller needs to be honest about how random the outcome of your purchase might be. As a customer, I just appreciate honesty and facts.</li>
    <li> this came earlier than the estimated delivery date, so that was certainly a plus.  The color of the wig I received looks exactly like that picture, i was actually expecting something darker, since I always hear that the hair is usually darker than the pics.  However, the wig i received is extremely wavy/curly and it looks like it is layered which the picture does not show. Overall I am satisfied with this wig, it is very pretty, it came with a mesh wig cap so that was nice, and a lot of people are saying it looks real. Update: I used a hair straightner to straighten the wig and it worked, it is heat resistant and it straightened it pretty well!!! loks great!</li>
    <li> great wig delivery was fast coming from China</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep it simple.. The wig itself was soft and manageable, the color was pretty close to the picture( it&#x27;s a very beautiful color throughout), the bangs were a tad long BUT that&#x27;s a good thing (nothing a pair of scissors can&#x27;t fix), and to top it all off no one noticed its a wig ;) pretty natural looking!</li>
    <li> This is an adorable wig. It&#x27;s thin, but you get what you pay. It doesn&#x27;t look natural, but it does look great for cosplay/costumes. It&#x27;s soft too. :)</li>
    <li> I like how the wig look, however, the material seems a bit cheap and the hair was quite thin.  Also it sheds quite a lot after the first wear. But it works for the purpose that I&#x27;m going for, so I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
    <li> Great wig looks real very soft</li>
    <li> Cute wig, lasted me a month or two and people thought it was real</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a WAY brighter blonde than is pictured (think platinum, not muted blonde), and VERY shiny. I&#x27;m going to talc it to death and back and see where that gets me. Be prepared to struggle with the base of the wig, it&#x27;s a little on the small side (I do not recommend this for people with larger body proportions; my head fits in children&#x27;s hats), but it covers adequately with proper pinning. Again, the color is NOT as shown. I will try to update after the talc work. I DO NOT RECOMMEND HEAT STYLING THIS. I own a kanekalon wig; the fibers are way higher quality than what I received from this seller. This seems more like a thicker version of a costume shop wig. As mentioned by others, the fringe will require a trim, which is no big deal.</li>
    <li> This wig is PERFECT. Much longer than pictured (which is a good thing) and the bangs are side bangs instead of straight across (which is much better). Only thing is that the color is a little warmer than the picture, would be nice to be a little ashier but it&#x27;s still a good blonde. Looks natural on, good for costume or every day wear.</li>
    <li> I just got it, i liked it but is really thin, and the bangs looks pretty shiny and fake, but it is really pretty</li>
    <li> Nice for a Cosplay, I ended up cutting it and I was happy to see that even after I cut it ,it was still wavy, I am a bit upset about how it doesn&#x27;t actually have a skin top</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing, it&#x27;s super soft, it&#x27;s thick, you can pull the hair to the front without any tracks in the back!!! The color is a nice natural looking honey blonde, my only advice is to purchase a small brush with metal bristles (to prevent frizz) but the wig does get tangled a bit at the bottom, but any wig past the shoulders will. The wig is very much worth the purchase! I just ordered a second one!</li>
    <li> its really not that great</li>
    <li> The color was a little different, but I&#x27;m not sending it in! IT is a great wig, and looks real and lovely.</li>
    <li> Cute wig!!!! Looks great for being such a cheap price! I posted a pic with it on as my default Facebook pic and everyone loved my hair. I did cut about 4 inches off as I didn&#x27;t want it quite as long.</li>
    <li> Nice wig (as far as quality goes) but the color was completely off. I bought this for a sleeping beauty costume expecting an ash blonde color and instead I got platinum. Great if you want a super light blonde, but just not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> The color is a very natural and pretty medium cool blonde. The fiber looks like real hair and isn&#x27;t too shiny. My only complaint is that the wig is very thin and the lace is visible in many spots.</li>
    <li> Looks and fits amazingly!</li>
    <li> Took forever too arrive and was too late to use with my&lt;br /&gt;Halloween costume also the quality was not even close&lt;br /&gt;to as good as was it claimed to be. I never wore it and&lt;br /&gt;ņever wear it so was a total waste.</li>
    <li> Im sure I ordered an X&amp;Y Angle wig and I received a really awful knock off. Its thin, yellow and no where close to the picure. looking through the reviews and the customer photos it seems some people received what is pictured and some received crappy fakes. I suppose it&#x27;s a gamble and I lost.</li>
    <li> This wig wasn&#x27;t great quality, but fit well. I brushed it a bit and the ends became less curly and slightly matted-looking. Great for a cute wig but not the best quality.</li>
    <li> It was my first time trying a wig and I have an abnormally large head. I was worried that it would not fit me but to my surprise it i after a little wiggling and adjusting. The color is a lovely fresh blonde color. It made my face have this healthy glow. It just over all brightened up my face. The quality of the wig is also really good and soft not plastic like other wigs i&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> love this item - perfect for what I needed</li>
    <li> •Shipping: Took less that 2 weeks; very quick •Pros: The wig quality is 100% kankalon which makes it very soft and high quality It looks very natural and could almost pass off as real hair, because I&#x27;m Asian it will still be somewhat unbelievable :P  •Cons: it&#x27;s a bit on the thin side but really it&#x27;s still covered and doesn&#x27;t shoe any bald spots-- it&#x27;s good enough.  Anyway I have to say it&#x27;s one of the better quality wigs I&#x27;ve purchased for a cheap price. Here are some pics of me (*&#x27;Д｀*)ﾉ))  *UPDATE I have also bought another X&amp;Y angel wig in light brown and it is just as soft and high quality as this one. The wig is full but not too thick and not that thin; medium thickness. It&#x27;s perfect and lovely, lol people keep complimenting me on my hair even though it&#x27;s just a wig :)</li>
    <li> It sheds a lot but no more than other synthetic wigs. Overall, pleased.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Very natural looking!</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE! The bangs are NOT straight like I wanted. I attempted to straighten them because it said heat resistant and the plastic melted anyway!! The color is way warmed than the picture too. It&#x27;s not the wig in the picture at all it&#x27;s thinner and you can see through to the wig cap.&lt;br /&gt;Not cool.</li>
    <li> Not really what u see in the photo...not a terrible wig. But just not terrific either. Bangs and layers are not like pictured here.</li>
    <li> The wig color is NOT as it is in the picture. It is a light brown and not even close to a blonde. The material is good though and it&#x27;s easy to brush. It looks good but honestly I have too many brown wigs already and I wanted a blonde wig but this product is NOT blonde.</li>
    <li> good quality, i thinned out the bang and shortind it and made it less straight. good buy!</li>
    <li> Was totally in love with this wig the minute I received it!!! Perfect natural milky blonde color. I suggest using baby powder or a dry shampoo spray to take down the shine. After I did that it looked very natural. Another thing I did was add a little brown eyeshadow where there would be roots. It definitely helps it have a natural flow.</li>
    <li> The hair texture is actually pretty good, but like other commenters said, the wefts are so thin that you can see them from thBangs/fringe up. You&#x27;d have to wear a hat if you wear this in public. Also, mine is a weird color of blonde, like a lemon platinum --so much paler than I was anticipating. I know it was only $10, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but the color was way different from what the others described.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that the wig looks nothing like the picture. It&#x27;s platinum blonde. which I was fine with for my costume, but is not what they advertised. It is also extremely thin. I have fine hair and it&#x27;s about chin length and I could barely fit it in the cap (and I have a relatively small head) and once I did get it to fit the hair was so thin it didn&#x27;t cover my edges at all. I had hopes of wearing this for more than cosplay but I don&#x27;t think that will happen. I&#x27;m going to have to add more wefts to it.</li>
    <li> Better than any of the wigs I saw at the Halloween store. Looks great.</li>
    <li> Better than most halloween wigs, but still not particularly great. It&#x27;ll do the trick if you&#x27;re looking for an Elsa costume wig or something of the like (the colour is very pale, not as ashy as in the picture). However, it&#x27;s very thin and it&#x27;s very easy to see the liner through the top if the hairs are shifted out of place. Also, really hard to hide long dark hair. This would probably be best to layer on top of shorter blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy wearing this wig. It looks and feels great. The only thing is that I wish it was a little more full, like in the picture. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed that the color was not even close to the product photo. It was a much, much darker blonde than pictured. The photo I have posted is Instagrammed, so the pictured color is a LITTLE darker than actual, but as you can see, it&#x27;s not even remotely close to the described color.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t even look like the wig i got. My wig is yellow.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured. It&#x27;s a very pretty ashy blonde. Perfect for my chobits cosplay!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look anything like it does In the picture tangled gross fake color (I&#x27;ve had better quality and color from the wigs you buy at Walmart for Halloween for 2 $!! Very thin</li>
</ol>
