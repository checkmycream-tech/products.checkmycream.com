      <li>Hopefully it will get even better.</li>
      <li>I love this product along with Gerovital&#x27;s anti-aging serum and hialuronic ampoules.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the combination of the three products for two weeks</li>
      <li>My favorite skin care product</li>
      <li>and I am more pleased with the results from these products</li>
      <li>Will surely buy again.  </li>
      <li>I feel better</li>
      <li>my face looks more radiant healthy and moisturized</li>
      <li>If it worked it might be okay, but I&#x27;ve seen no improvement &amp;</li>
      <li>Her skin has more firmness and she stopped complaining about wrinkles.   </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>it leaves your skin so smooth and silky</li>
      <li>She recommended this product made in Romania and tested in France and I was happy to find it finally on Amazon.   </li>
      <li>We are soo happy to finally find this!!</li>
      <li>Good results are seen so far.</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily, and after a minute or two, is absorbed into the skin.</li>
      <li>my skin is much more crinkly and older looking than is</li>
      <li>We see sooo many products on the shopping channels that do not deliver, do not work or the results are mediocre at best.</li>
      <li>i would highly recommend i did receive this product at a discount for my review and absolutely love it</li>
      <li>After trying many different and expensive creams over the years I am truly thrilled and impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>Let your whole family try it and they will thank you for it!!</li>
      <li>I came back again to order more, you know...</li>
      <li>The first time I applied it my skins texture dramatically improved.</li>
      <li>It may be lacking advertising and marketing (they are very well known and famous in Europe), but we can say that it makes a difference for a fact, simply because it was used for years and years.</li>
      <li>Gerovital H3 Evolution Anti-Aging Cream looks promising.</li>
      <li>I use this for over six ninth now and people tell me my skin is very plump and youthful.</li>
      <li>I like light creams that your skin soaks up and no residue is left.</li>
      <li>Just gently rub the area.</li>
      <li>Not sure if it is because of the warm weather or something else,</li>
      <li>used for the prevention and treatment of ageing signs, wrinkles, dryness, lack of elasticity and firmness of mature skins fading of wrinkles, the renewal of collagen and the pure energy needed for proper cells functioning this</li>
      <li>Or could be I am just too young for it at age 47</li>
      <li>this &#x27;treatment&#x27; was very drying, left a matte finish - which one really doesn&#x27;t want when treating under eye wrinkles - with all the positive reviews, i was very excited to give it a try, very expensive product now in the trash....</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very heavy and doesn&#x27;t flow onto the face smoothly.  </li>
      <li>It definitely has restructuring properties, and leaves my skin so moist and soft, as well.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It has a lot of chemicals in it- which irritate my eyes. Had to stop using it on my face. Guess I will finish using it on my elbows and knees.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream.  It definitely has restructuring properties, and leaves my skin so moist and soft, as well.  Will surely buy again.  Love it!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I lci thus product.  It is very thick cream but it does the job.  I use this for over six ninth now and people tell me my skin is very plump and youthful.</li>
    <li> I found about this product when me and my wife visited our friend in France.   We haven&#x27;t seen her in 5 years and she looked amazing. She recommended this product made in Romania and tested in France and I was happy to find it finally on Amazon.   I bought it for my wife on her birthday and she loves it. She is using it for one month and I can tell the difference.   Her skin has more firmness and she stopped complaining about wrinkles.   I came back again to order more, you know... happy wife - happy life.</li>
    <li> I love this product along with Gerovital&#x27;s anti-aging serum and hialuronic ampoules.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the combination of the three products for two weeks and I am more pleased with the results from these products then any other I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great gerovital product!</li>
    <li> We are soo happy to finally find this!! This is a rare product that you cannot find in US with amazing results!! We can say that for a fact, my mother and grandmother used this for years before coming to US and have been looking for it ever since. We are going to purchase the whole series, they are made by the same company and can hardly wait for the rest to come.  Buy this with a 100% confidence and you will NOT regret it. We see sooo many products on the shopping channels that do not deliver, do not work or the results are mediocre at best. This DOES. It may be lacking advertising and marketing (they are very well known and famous in Europe), but we can say that it makes a difference for a fact, simply because it was used for years and years. After this you will not  use anything else!  Get it and see for yourselves!! Let your whole family try it and they will thank you for it!!</li>
    <li> wonderful cream&lt;br /&gt;from the moment you use it I could feel my face and moisturized every day that passes I feel better my face looks more radiant healthy and moisturized</li>
    <li> used for the prevention and treatment of ageing signs, wrinkles, dryness, lack of elasticity and firmness of mature skins fading of wrinkles, the renewal of collagen and the pure energy needed for proper cells functioning this is awesome it leaves your skin so smooth and silky i would highly recommend i did receive this product at a discount for my review and absolutely love it my face felt refreshing after applying  can apply it twice a day, in the evening and morning</li>
    <li> I have used this product with the H3 Hyalauronic Acid.  It makes your skin radiant.  I am a convert.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy, easy to use and feels good on your face.  Nice Product.</li>
    <li> My favorite skin care product</li>
    <li> My wife has been using it for a couple of months and she likes it. She is happy with it.</li>
    <li> this &#x27;treatment&#x27; was very drying, left a matte finish - which one really doesn&#x27;t want when treating under eye wrinkles - with all the positive reviews, i was very excited to give it a try, very expensive product now in the trash....</li>
    <li> I have been using this twice a day and nothing is happening but I do need to give it a chance. I will say I have been putting it on my arms for age spots and I can honestly say seems to be fading them somewhat. I will continue this product and see what results I am getting.</li>
    <li> I bought the Gerovital H3 Revolution after reading other customer reviews on Amazon. I was not disappointed. It goes on easily, and after a minute or two, is absorbed into the skin. I use it on my face and neck, and it has improved the appearance of my skin. The only issue I have is that the jar leaks badly from air flights, and I don&#x27;t want to lose any of this stuff!</li>
    <li> Gerovital H3 Evolution Anti-Aging Cream looks promising. Box says it&#x27;s Made in Romania. I&#x27;m hopeful that this product is effective as I will give it to my mom who is 45+ in age. Will update my review later. I received this product in exchange for my unbiased and honest feedback.</li>
    <li> I like light creams that your skin soaks up and no residue is left. This one is a little too heavy for me. Regardless of how min I put on at night, the next morning I can still see and feel it. Not sure if it is because of the warm weather or something else, but I do need to wash it off in the morning to avoid staying shiny during the day. Or could be I am just too young for it at age 47</li>
    <li> The reviews for this product were good, so I was inclined to purchase.  But once it arrived, it is this tiny jar that will last no time at all.  It&#x27;s $40 for that amount.  If it worked it might be okay, but I&#x27;ve seen no improvement &amp; it&#x27;s very heavy and doesn&#x27;t flow onto the face smoothly.  In my opinion, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> cream does not rub in well to skin</li>
    <li> It causes some scracthy skin irritation at times. Don&#x27;t scratch the skin. Just gently rub the area. Good results are seen so far. Hopefully it will get even better.</li>
    <li> Simply Amazing! The first time I applied it my skins texture dramatically improved. I cannot explain it. I am almost 46 but between life experiences and years of sun damage my skin is much more crinkly and older looking than is should be. This product instantly improved my appearance. My husband noticed!  I have only used it for a couple of days so I will update other improvements after continued use. I just ordered another jar for my travel bag as I travel a lot and don&#x27;t want to be without it. After trying many different and expensive creams over the years I am truly thrilled and impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> gave as gift.&lt;br /&gt;she seems to like it</li>
