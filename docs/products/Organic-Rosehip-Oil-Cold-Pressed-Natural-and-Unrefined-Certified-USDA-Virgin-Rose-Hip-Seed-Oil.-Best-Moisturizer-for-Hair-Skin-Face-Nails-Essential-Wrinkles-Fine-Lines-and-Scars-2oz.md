<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this stuff it really makes your face so soft !</li>
    <li> I use this for my dry patches on my face. It has been great thus far. Don&#x27;t forget to refrigerate it for longer lasting.</li>
    <li> I had a previous oil from NOW foods and it was clear with a faint smell. this one has a true  golden rosehip color  and pretty strong vitamin E- like smell. looks and feels like a real deal to me. glass bottle, convenient glass dropper. feels and makes skin look better than my previous rosehip seed oil. has USDA organic and ECOCERT stamps on it</li>
    <li> Rosehip oil will make your hair and skin so nice!!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the results of this amazing product!</li>
    <li> I will update this review. I received my product but it is very oily and my skin is also. I am afraid to try it. After reading up some more on the oil is is not for acne prone, oily skin. I still may have a use for it though. It does have a ton of wonderful medicinal properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review 2: Okay its been a couple of days. I have used it on some stretch marks, scars, and my dry feet....I think I am in love...give me a couple more days. I know what you are thinking omg you have stretch marks, scars, and dry feet???EEEWWW :) STICK IT HATERS</li>
    <li> i love this oil, they&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s a dry oil.  I have used 2 days and can see a difference in my dry cracked feet.</li>
    <li> High quality Rose Hip Seed Oil.......haven&#x27;t used long enough to notice any benefit, but face feels soooooo&lt;br /&gt;soft after applying.....will update with any benefit after I have used for 1 month......</li>
    <li> By purchasing 100% Pure Organic Rosehip Seed Oil I was looking for a product to help me with age spots that seem to be taking over my hands.  I wanted something that wouldn’t leave my skin feeling greasy.  This oil absorbs quickly into the skin and really has a different smell but it doesn’t linger.  The smell disappears as quickly as the oil does into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry, flaky skin and it has helped especially with the harsh, cold weather that we have been experiencing lately.&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim’s Organic Rosehip Seed Oil  includes such ingredients as Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Linoleic Acid (Omega-6), Linolenic Acid (Omega-3), Lycopene (antioxidant), &amp; Beta-carotene (antioxidant).&lt;br /&gt;It helps create a beautiful even tone to your skin and shouldn’t you give your skin that nature has to offer.  You’re worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free for review and this is just my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Rosehip oil is one of my favorites, and this brand is awesome! Certified organic. Absorbs so quickly with no leftover greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my crows feet and cuticles and they are left so soft!&lt;br /&gt;Great size bottle. Dark to preserve oil, and I love the glass dropper included for ease of measuring.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this unfortunately because I couldn&#x27;t at that moment. I am only giving one star because it asked me to give a review and I didn&#x27;t even get to purchase the product.</li>
    <li> The Rosehip Seed oil was delivered in protective packaging and as described on product page.&lt;br /&gt;We purchased the oil in a promotion for testing and review.  We have been impressed with&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim products, overall.  This Rosehip seed Oil is pure and Organic, and a great value at&lt;br /&gt;the current advertised sale price</li>
    <li> Been using thus for my hair. It feels amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this product! My skin. Ever looked so good! My only complaint would be that dropper isn&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> Seems like its a good product but has an off-putting smell. Not a strong scent but not pleasant to me. Will not re-order.</li>
    <li> excellent.  I like the size and the dispenser</li>
    <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin feeling a little drab? Winter weather have your face and skin feeling dry and down? Check out FoxBrim 100% pure Rosehip Seed Oil. This oil is organic and sourced directly from Chile to provide you with the best ingredients that are unrefined and cold pressed. The oil will take your face and skin on an adventure full of fading age spots, less discoloration, less signs of aging and the reduction of scars and blemishes. After each adventure with Rosehip Seed Oil your skin will be left feeling smoother, more even and younger looking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil includes many essential vitamins to get this process done. The vitamins packed into this tiny little bottle include but are not limited to Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Beta-Carotene and Lycopene an anti-oxidant as well as other agents. This little bottle is nature&#x27;s gift back to you if used daily. There are no additives and when applying you will note that there are no fragrances as well that are found so often in oils and vitamin agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are worried that the product will not work well for you, the company offers a guarantee of a full refund if you do not feel the product satisfies your desires. I feel that any company that performs such a task must really be confident in what their product has to offer and this oil, after trying, is definitely holding true to its word! You will not be disappointed if you use it on a regular and routine basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally used this oil to help with my fingernails and a small scar on my face I have had since a child. I found that within a weeks time of applying nightly that my scar appeared more even and less prominent and that my fingernails felt stronger and I was less wanting to bite them as I am a chronic nail biter. I found the product easy to use just dropping and then rubbing the oil into my nails and cuticles. The dropper made it easy to use and not over indulge as the bottle is small but if you use it once a day should last for quite awhile. The feeling upon the skin is not oily like some oils can be and seems to immediately almost absorb to start working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product is definitely worth the money!found the product easy to use just dropping and then rubbing the oil into my nails and cuticles.

    <li> I USE A LOT OF FOXBRIM&#x27;S PRODUCTS.  THEY ALWAYS DELIVER HIGH QUALITY PURE PRODUCTS.  THIS ROSEHIP SEED OIL IS FANTASTIC.  I USE IT ONCE A WEEK IN MY HAIR FOR DEEP MOISTURIZING, AND I CAN REALLY SEE A DIFFERENCE.  I ALSO USE IT AT NIGHT ON MY FEET.  THIS HAS REALLY HELPED WITH DRYNESS.  I USE IT ALL OVER MY BODY.  IT REALLY IS A GOOD MOISTURIZER.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I love rose hip oil it is the best. I received this to review and I love the quality.</li>
    <li> Another fabulous product from Foxbrim.  I am so pleased with their product line that I&#x27;ve started gifting some products to my friends and family.  This Rosehip Seed Oil makes a wonderful gift basket item.</li>
    <li> This is so great for your skin. I have been fighting a dry ice burn on my hand and thumb. I started using foxbrim rosehip oil on my hand and after just one week, the results are amazing. I would recommend this to you.  I also started putting this on the deep wrinkles on my face. I have been a smoker for 50+ years.  Love it!!!!  I just read a review regarding putting it on your hair, for a conditioning treatment. I&#x27;m trying this and will update you on that later. Finally, I must say, when this bottle runs low, I most certainly will be ordering another. Customer for life!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this the last few weeks as a go to dry oil, it&#x27;s good for everything from your face to your body to your hair to scars.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s in a very easy to use pump bottle ( yay! Especially helpful when using it as a body oil) so you don&#x27;t have to worry about spilling it or getting too much. the bottle is also dark so it maintains it&#x27;s efficacy; however to keep it at it&#x27;s most effective, I recommend storing either in the refrigerator or a cool dark place- i:e- not your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge fan, as I&#x27;ve stated multiple times, of natural and organic products as well as multitasking products. Putting this on my legs after shaving made them feel INSANELY soft and smooth, and using this at night under my moisturizer left my skin glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I applied a few drops of this to the ends of my hair and it tamed my split ends. I&#x27;m looking at my hair right now, and I honestly can&#x27;t even see them. (Wow, do I need a haircut!)&lt;br /&gt;My fave use so far has got to be how it&#x27;s making the scars on my foot feel. I had some really major surgery on my foot a few months ago that left positively enormous scars that hurt like heck as the skin fights to stretch and heal. The itching gets so intense that it wakes me up sometimes, but i can put this oil on it and it absorbs immediately and brings up to 12 hours of relief. Ahhhhhhhhh.......And the price? You have to be kidding. This is ridonk cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this to review, but this is absolutely 100% my opinion!</li>
    <li> Love this!  I used to buy a few oils but they were essential oils for aromatherapy.  I quit buying because of the cost.  I never thought about oils for the skin.  This Rosehip Seed Oil is really neat.  It soaks in &amp; leaves the face &amp; hands so soft.  My cuticles are one piece again! no cracking!  The oil can be used on the hair for dry ends. Perfect!  Elbows &amp; feet soak it up!  I did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. Thank You!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great to add to your moisturizer and Dr Oz had a show on the benefits of rosehip oil mixed into your moisturizer. Talked about it being less expensive with mostly the same benefits. And this is organic!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to review it. I ordered several brands of rosehip oil to compare them. This particular one came with an absolutely rancid smell as if it has expired. Although my first thought was that they accidentally swapped rosehip with fish oil because that&#x27;s what it smells. I am familiar with what it is SUPPOSED to smell like, and although it&#x27;s not going to smell like roses, this is definitely &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;. Would not purchase again</li>
    <li> The complimentary bottle (2 ft. oz) of Rosehip Seed Oil that Foxbrim sent to us provides a numerous health and beauty benefits to our entire family.  Including in these benefits (but not limited) to are;  facial organic moisturizer (we applied after taking a shower), we also used this for body massage, hair and scalp massage oil and as a moisturizer for our baby&#x27;s skin rushes as an alternative for Coconut Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Rosehip Seed Oil is free from any harmful chemical and Certified Organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim&#x27;s Organic Rosehip Seed Oil includes:&lt;br /&gt;+ Vitamin A+ Vitamin C+ Linoleic Acid (Omega-6)&lt;br /&gt;+ Linolenic Acid (Omega-3)&lt;br /&gt;+ Lycopene (antioxidant)&lt;br /&gt;+ Beta-carotene (antioxidant)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Foxbrim&#x27;s Organic Rosehip Seed Oil you can:&lt;br /&gt;- Slow and reduce visible signs of aging such as wrinkles and fine lines&lt;br /&gt;- Fade age spots, skin discoloration and hyper-pigmentation&lt;br /&gt;- Reduce appearance of burns and blemishes&lt;br /&gt;- Heal scarring and diminish photo-aging&lt;br /&gt;- Create even and beautiful skin tone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because although it wasn&#x27;t what I expected, it was my fault for not reading the product description!&lt;br /&gt;This oil is wonderful but there is a difference between rosehip oil and rosehip seed oil!  There is not much of a difference as far as how it works, but rosehip oil is clear and odorless, whereas rosehip seed oil (this product) has an orange/brown tint and smells ... earthy.&lt;br /&gt;I only say this because I put rosehip oil on all the time and I don&#x27;t worry about it staining and I&#x27;m not sure how rosehip seed oil would work with white clothing.  Just a thought!&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest mixing this product with an essential oil for benefit as well as lightning up the smell!  :)&lt;br /&gt;I do love how this company sends out an email with a list of uses and benefits of their products!!</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding oil. I use it every morning and its perfect. I love how it smells and feels. Great purchase. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil to use with your essential oils or alone.  I have been experimenting with it and really like the feel and smell of it as a carrier oil</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  After using the rosehip seed oil my face is very soft and my pores seems to be smaller.  I wash my face and then apply the oil and place a warm washcloth on my face to seal in the oil although it does disappear very quickly once applied.  It is wonderful for your hands and hair also.  I am very happy and will purchase again.  It would be a wonderful gift for a friend. :)</li>
    <li> I was a bit wary of this product, just because I had never before used an oil-based moisturizer on my face. I don’t have very dry skin, so I worried that it might make my face excessively oily. But I have only great things to say about this product. I use it at night and in the morning after washing my face, and I think my skin is actually less oily than it was with my previous moisturizer. I have fairly sensitive skin, so I am hesitant to try new products. This one was a happy surprise. I use this along with the Foxbrim Vitamin C Serum, and I really feel like my skin has never looked better. I like that the ingredients are all organic and natural as well. A high quality product for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I like rosehip seed oil!  definitely great stuff.  I didn&#x27;t order this particular brand, but have order other products by this brand that are quality.</li>
    <li> I personally love all the different issues that one oil can treat! Whether someone is dealing with wrinkles, scars, burn marks, or just wants to even out their skin tone, this organic rosehip oil can cover all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it’s a mild type of oil, I found I can use it directly on my skin without any carrier oil needed. There’s no burning or uncomfortable feeling, even directly on my face. I do have trouble with red areas and dryness on my face, especially during the winter, so I wash my face every morning and then apply the rosehip seed oil. I can usually skip extra moisturizer, unless it’s super cold and I’m going to be spending time outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve also been using it on a few scars on my knees. I don’t think I’ve been using it long enough to make a visible difference, but my skin is definitely smoother and very soft where I’ve been applying it. Plus, with all the vitamins that are in this oil, I love that my body is getting an extra boost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great use is to apply it to your scalp and hair to help with dry, brittle hair and itchy scalps. Some people even add it directly to their current shampoo to make it easier to apply. But that’s up to you of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all oils and sensitive skin types, make sure to try a small spot first. If you notice irritation, consider adding it to coconut or olive oil then applying it to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put this miracle oil to work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. As described.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love rosehip seed oil!!!  So fantastic, makes a great face serum!!!</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin, love using it on my hair as well as a leave in</li>
    <li> Foxbrim Organic Rosehip Seed Oil has replaced my beloved (and very expensive) Moroccan Oil for my hair, but I&#x27;ve also found some surprising uses for it as well. Summer is usually really harsh on my feet due to spending so much time outside barefoot or in sandals, and my legs finally come out of winter hiding to see the sunshine in shorts and skirts which means lots of shaving and sun exposure. After I shower and shave, I apply the oil to my legs and feet to nourish and protect my skin and I&#x27;ve noticed I can go longer in between shaving!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few days now and I am ready to review. I don&#x27;t like the smell, though I am very sensitive to smell. The smell is almost nutty but like no other nut I have ever smelled. It&#x27;s weird. Luckily, I have been using it in conjunction with other products so it dilutes the smell and I don&#x27;t barf. The first night I used this (I only use oil at night as I wash my face twice daily and would not walk out of the house looking like a walking oily blob) I woke up with glowing skin! I have eczema and usually always have these two patches on my cheeks but when I woke up they were virtually unnoticeable. After another few nights they are gone! I&#x27;ve been googling rosehip oil benefits and am so excited for the long term effects!</li>
    <li> I tried the rosehip seed oil for the first time this morning and see an improvement in the fine lines around my mouth.  Also my dimples which have turned into wrinkles on either side of my mouth are much less pronounced.  I see from the product notes that some people have a problem with the aroma of the oil, but it didn&#x27;t bother me and was gone in a matter of seconds, not minutes.  As I continue to use the oil I will update my review.  If it continues to deliver results like it seems to have with one use, I&#x27;ll be one happy camper.  Thanks to Amazon for introducing me to rosehip oil!  **After using this for several consecutive days I see improvement in my skin texture.  It really makes the lines and wrinkles disappear.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is truly a multi use product. You can use this on your whole body. You can apply this to your face and neck this is also great for scars, stretchmarks and skin blemishes. I have really been loving this for my hair. I squirt just a little in my hands ad I have been applying it to my dry hair mostly and it really helps with the dryness and adds a little bit of shine. I can say that I do not really love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t linger. You can also use this for brittle nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for review purposes. My opinions are honest and I was not paid.</li>
    <li> Also oil smell not good, it has a fishy smell with golden yellow color, color is beautiful but I feel this oil is rancid.&lt;br /&gt;When I apply my face I feel like cooking, little itchy and there are some red spot on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I purchase many rosehip oil and many review said golden yellow color with scent mean real rosehip oil but I can&#x27;t agree.&lt;br /&gt;I judge with after apply not just looking color and smell. Real rosehip oil makes my skin so soft and not itchy at all.</li>
    <li> I revived this on a discount in honor of my review. I love this oil. So far it&#x27;s been amazing.</li>
    <li> I just love it. Pure Body Naturals is a great brand with lots of good products.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly, not greasy under my sunscreen.</li>
    <li> good.&lt;br /&gt;Feel so silky</li>
    <li> Amazing improvement in my skin tone. Extremely something as well.  Face was always reddish at my cheeks and that seems to be diminishing as well.</li>
    <li> Pros: I believe it is slowly making a difference on my scarring. It definitely keeps my nail area hydrated. Im trying it on my belly to prevent stretch marks also. I do enjoy it and the scarring has had a noticeable visible drop in redness and swollenness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It smells terrible. It&#x27;s not a lasting smell, and it doesn&#x27;t follow you around, so it&#x27;s certainly worth it, but don&#x27;t inhale too deeply while applying! Does not carry all through the day or I would lower the star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty major scarring on my hand from a tattoo (UV ink, so it&#x27;s see through ink, but the scar is VERY visible) which I thought this may help with. I use it once per day after showering. Many parts of the scarred area have calmed down completely, parts of it have just lost a lot of the red swollen nastiness. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s all the rosehip oil, but progress ONLY started after I started using this. I used other scarring creams on it before and nothing changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: they changed the pump to a dropper. Its extremely hard to use and I was happy with the previous nozzle. When I contact ted them they offered no way to get the pump instead. I cannot use a dropper.</li>
    <li> wondering if the rancid smell is normal?</li>
    <li> You can tell this is very good quality oil. Non-greasy and soaks in quickly without over-soaking-in (if that makes sense). I put this on my dry skin, and it stays moisturized all day. Better than any lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Also moisturizes hair and makes it shiny. The fragrance is kind of interesting; not bad - just..interesting. :-) I would buy this again and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Have used twice. Product seems useful, as advertised.  Not enamored with the scent. Expected a more Rose odor.  Otherwise, I will continue its use and would probably reorder.</li>
    <li> This is great for oil cleansing, and does not irritate my skin at all. The price point is good, the packaging is good, and my skin looks great! No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Very high quality and effective</li>
    <li> I love love love all natural oils.  I just received this but I always go to pinterest to see the many many ways to use it.  I am very happy to add this to my skin care regimen .... natural and awesome.  I received it promptly and safely like always from Amazon. ..thank you.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my Mom and she absolutely loves it.  She loves the smell and uses it every morning.</li>
    <li> Great Product! I cannot believe this is the first time I have found this product! Love it!!</li>
    <li> How refreshing to find a product that delivers. I have used this on my face and hair (best thing I&#x27;ve ever used to smooth out the frizz). I softens and calms my skin &amp; hair beautifully.</li>
    <li> i have used this for several reasons eczema, dry cracked feet, moisturizer for my face and have even incorporated it into my hair routine. The only reason this oil did not get higher than 3 stars is because of the scent. It is not pleasing at all and because if it I cannot/will not add it to my DYI lotions and creams. As I am afraid that it will alter the lovely scents I and others have created. I will however continue to use it for over night treatments and then shower the next morning.  Even after the first use I notice a big difference I my dry heels and the dry ends of my hair. The longer I use it the better this seems to be getting. So high points for that. I also soothes the eczema out breaks I tend to get this time of year and this I believe to be because of the lightness and quickly absorbing formula. It is virtually oiliness free within a minute of application. Will finish my bottle but may not repurchase unless the scent is addressed as I really do prefer to purchase items that can have multiple purposes (instead of just using as is).</li>
    <li> This is the second beauty related oil I&#x27;ve ever purchased (the first being argan oil) and after only a week, I can feel the difference and am so impressed!!  The only downfall is it has a bit of a potent smell (that goes away after a while).  I put it on my face before bed and it absorbs quite quickly, I wake up with my skin SO soft and looking better than ever.  I have not used or needed facial toner or moisturizing cream since using this oil!  Terribly dry skin on my cuticles and heels of my feet are softer than ever as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using the rosehip oil in my hair for 2 weeks now! I love it! I deal with damaged hair from years of coloring. This has made my hair so smooth and healthy! I love it and a must have</li>
    <li> I love this oil. The product is light..easy to absorb and my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I make natural skin care products and rose hip oil is one of my main ingredients for &amp;#34;over 40&amp;#34; skin care. This brand is one of the best around!</li>
    <li> This is a good product and shipped fast. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it for very long to see full results but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son who recently had surgery and has some big scars.  We haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference.  Have only been using it for a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for the past few weeks, but so far it&#x27;s been a positive experience. It&#x27;s kept my skin feeling moist, not dried out in this summer heat. Before purchasing I read some reviews that said it had a funny smell but it just smells like essential oils to me!</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I use it to moisturize my face. It absorbs well without leaving a greasy film and smells amazing, kind of like black tea.</li>
    <li> I love this Rosehip Seed Oil. Its smell so good and relaxing. I use it in the humidifier, laundry detergents, and add a few drop in my bath. Love it. Will recommend to friend and family.</li>
    <li> This oil smells very nice! I love using a little bit in my bath and it leaves my skin really soft. The bottle is a very nice size and it comes with a pump that makes it vey easy to use. I love that is organic and all natural. i did receive it to review.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim Rosehip Oil has natural ingredients and oils. This oil is an all multi purpose oil for the price of one. This oil can be used to treat dry and severly damaged hair, scars, dark brown spots, blemishes, corrects UV damage caused by the sun. This miracle oil even heals with skin problems such as eczema, psoriasis and even acne. Rosehip is a great moisturizer and replenishes your skin for a softer, smoother, and sensually looking skin that is deeply well nourished with the many antioxidants and many beautifying vitamins, oils and the many other nutrients in this bottle that will deeply enrich your skin to its full potential. I highly recommend Fixbrim beauty products,  they have high quality lune if skin products that will make woman around the world be and feel happier about their appearances.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this amazing oil! Great for skin &amp; hair! It hydrates my tired winter skin &amp; it&#x27;s glowing! This is the real deal, 100% organic, non greasy, soaks right in, light scent like green tea, but goes away immediately. Chock full of skin loving vitamins. I apply 2 pumps directly &amp; it covers my face &amp; neck. Or I add 1 pump to my moisturizer. I will never be without this amazing oil!</li>
    <li> This is a new oil for me to try out! Love the Oils</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Foxbrim Rosehip Seed Oil.  I use this daily on my cuticles (fingers and toes) to keep them healthy, supple, and soft.  I find that gently applying a few drops directly on the nail is excellent for keeping the nails conditioned and strong.&lt;br /&gt;I do use it twice a week on my face and neck for deep moisturizing  and to help alleviate the appearance of fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;It is a life-saver if you&#x27;ve gotten a sunburn. Gently apply and smooth over the burned skin for deep relief.  I&#x27;ve used it for that just this week.  It helps the burned skin heal faster and with less pain, itching, and peeling. I keep it close by when I come in from the pool.&lt;br /&gt;I received this oil in order to facilitate this review.  All opinions are my own and based on my own experiences.</li>
    <li> I received the FoxBrim Rosehip seed Oil free and for review.  I was excited to receive this product as I have been greatly enjoying all the FoxBrim products I have had the privilege to try.  This company has never disappointed me.  You may be wondering what one does with Rosehip oil.  Well, first, let me explain what rosehip actually is.  Rosehip is the fruit of the rose plant.  Do not get mixed up with the flower.  It is a fruit product of the plant.  Rosehip can be used for ingestive purposes such as jams or teas.  But, when pressed, the oily product is a wonderful product that nourishes the skin and hair.  When nutrients such as vitamins, omegas, and anti-oxidants are added, you have a wonderful product.  This particular rosehip oil comes in a very eye appealing bottle with  purple label.  It comes in pump form so I is easy to administer.  There is a slight thickness to it and has a sliht, yet unique scent.  This is truly the best time of year to try out this product.  I have extremely dry skin.  It gets so dry in the cold that it cracks.  After application of this oil, it moisturizes my skin and starts the healing process.  It is also good to use for dry scalp.  Just a few drops massaged into the scalp take away the dry and itchy feeling.  This is a product that I definitely recommend you give a try.</li>
    <li> Love this!!&lt;br /&gt;Skin is so soft now!!</li>
    <li> Using it for the last fewdays after cleansing makes my skin very soft and baby like.</li>
    <li> Great price and quick delivery! Rose hip seed oil helps with many skin issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with Foxbrim! I&#x27;ve bought a few of their beauty products, now and they don&#x27;t disappoint. This is a nice size bottle of organic rosehip seed oil. I love that it&#x27;s cold pressed. Great value</li>
    <li> Item arrived as promised!</li>
    <li> Good price and fast shipping. Have been using Rosehip oil for about a year now and it&#x27;s wonderful. I recommend this product and have my family and friends using it daily...</li>
    <li> Overall great treatment oil. I use this at night on my face and I also use it after getting out of the shower on my neck and chest. It did not cause me any breakouts or irritation. I have sensitive skin too and my skin reacted really well. My skin was hydrated and glowing after I used this at night. I used this during the day mixed in with a matte foundation (just a tiny bit) and it gave my skin a nice dewy, summery look.  I also used this before bed on my hands because my hands get so dry even in the summer. It worked really well to repair my skin overnight. I love too that this brand is cruelty-free and all natural. Two thumbs uo!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of fox brim products anyway. This rosehip Seed Oil is an amazingly versatile product! A wonderful hydrator full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that are known to correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, restore skin elasticity, and boost collagen production, all while reducing scars and fine lines. It can also be used as an addition to lotions and creams, as it’s anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant, which helps to decrease environmental damage and soothe the skin.</li>
    <li> Good to use on my natural hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  I have been using it partly as a carrier oil for my other essential oils, and it really brings its own benefits to the table!  I love it!  The smell is wonderful, too!</li>
    <li> great moisturizer for all skin types and can be used for many things.  After going in the hot sun for a while, my skin was dry and really needed something for the dryness and sunburn and this stuff really worked.  My skin was instantly revitalized and best thing was no breakouts.</li>
    <li> To tell you the truth am still using an old bottle from a different company, I tried yours a few times but it have a unusual odor, is this normal? I don&#x27;t have this on the sun or direct light, please let me know</li>
    <li> Foxbrim brand is great. I love their products. Sometimes I get a chance to review them, and that is even better! Rose hip oil contains vitamin A, vitamin C and the essential fatty acids omega-3 and omega-6. It absorbs quickly, so I don&#x27;t get that greasy feeling on my skin. It&#x27;s light, and leaves my skin feeling supple. It helps with smoothing out my skin tone too.&lt;br /&gt;I use rosehip oil for moisture retention, and ,on my cuticles.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past few days. Like other Foxbrim products I have used in the past few months it holds true to its claim. Thanks to tomoson.com I was give a free sample of this Rose hip seed oil. It works well with out irritating the skin. It has hydrated my skin a great deal and left it a bit softer. I have been using it at night before bed. I found it seals in the moisture and helps sooth dry skin. It does have a hint of a distinct odor to it but it fades quickly.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several products from Foxbrim and have been really impressed with the quality of the products I received. They were packaged well and were exactly what I was hoping I&#x27;d receive.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim is one of my favorite companies for natural, organic beauty products like this one. If it&#x27;s got the Foxbrim name, I know I can trust it. This oil is prepared to be perfect for use on the skin. Unlike a moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t leave a matte finish - you will have a little sheen, which is expected because it is an oil. For this reason, you should apply it at night. It feels lighter than olive oil but a bit heavier than baby oil.  I have an essential oil diffuser and thought that the rosehip seed oil would give off a pleasant, floral fragrance, but it doesn&#x27;t. It hardly smells at all. I applied it on my whole face last night and woke up without a single pimple, which is pretty rare for me. I applied my make-up this morning and it looks much better than normal and I have to wonder if it&#x27;s because the rosehip seed oil has left my skin glowing! Clinical studies on rosehip seed oil (along with positive reviews across the internet) promise that it works great on acne scarring and wrinkles, among a series of other conditions. Pretty much any product that promises to remove acne scarring is normally filled with chemicals and costs an arm and a leg. This product offers a natural and proven way to get rid of them at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> I have chronically dry skin in the winter time and my hair is almost always frizzy when I wake up. Luckily, I found a product that is a great solution for my problems: rosehip seed oil! I had never tried this product before and I would always use hand cream to moisturize my hands in the winter time. However, I always hated dealing with the lotion residue on the bottom of my hands. As a moisturizer, I give this product an A+! It made my hands so soft after application and seemed to absorb quickly so that I did not have to deal with slimey residue. The product smells like a mix between a black tea and almonds and has a dark orange color to it. It does come out very runny but I think this helps it absorb quicker so I have no complaints about that. On the other hand, it was useful in taming frizzy hair but it did not seem to work as well as the argan oil that I was using before this product. I typically apply the oil into my wet hair after my shower and it did a good job of taming the frizz so I didn&#x27;t wake up to Albert Einstein hair in the morning</li>
    <li> I received this rosehip oil for free* to try and review because I am really interested in different types of oils for natural beauty products instead of using all of the chemical filled ones from name brand companies. This one is organic making it a great choice if you are trying to use more natural products and it is pure so you don&#x27;t have to worry about any other chemicals in it. This has a slightly light orange/dark yellowish color to it which is what you should expect from a rosehip oil that hasn&#x27;t been watered down with a different cheaper type of carrier oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like about this brand is the packaging, I&#x27;m getting sick of droppers. Glass droppers are great, but I enjoy the pump on this bottle because I often find myself loosing product between bottle and palm of hand or skin. The pump can be placed directly above where you want the oil and then just pump however much you need and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is very moisturizing, absorbs into my skin well and doesn&#x27;t give me any negative reactions. I have sensitive skin so I always look for products that do not affect my skin. I have no issues rubbing it into my facial skin and if I use just a slight bit after bathing or a heavy duty wash it soaks in and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily like some other products can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of getting this rosehip oil for free this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I use this is my coconut oil moisturizer as a stablizer and extra nutrients for my skin.  I just love it!</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin! Love this product!</li>
    <li> First, as others have noticed this product has a distinct smell but it dissipates quickly so don&#x27;t let that scare you.  This moisturizing oil absorbs quickly (no greasy feel or sheen) and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that my skin is more supply and my fine lines are less noticeable after about a month of use.  Also, I have facial eczema and this doesn&#x27;t exacerbate the condition and has helped with the redness I experience.</li>
    <li> Excellent, fine quality product. Skin feels soft and nourished after just a couple days of use.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!!  It really is the BEST rose hip seed oil!!  My face feels so smooth in the morning and I can mix it with other oils.  I love Foxbrim.</li>
    <li> I was not aware that there was a Rosehip Oil on the market until I was given the opportunity to try this product. The product is 100% certified organic Rosehip see oil. So in other words it’s an un-tampered product. So what you are really getting is the extract from the source: The oil from wild rose bushes.  The oil is said to have several healing properties: It’s been used for reducing wrinkles, fade age spots, it can help with burns and blemishes, scarring, stretch marks and treat dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used this product for 3 ½ weeks and I have to say the products has an earthy smell. (The oil is not rancid). It has it natural odor I can’t really explain; the aroma of it can be described as a combination of herbs. But like I mention I’ve been using the product for several 3 ½ weeks and I’m not sure but after several weeks the smell has dissipated. So it’s great because I really like the fact that this product is recommend it for dry skin. I have dry crack skin on my hands. Every winter I suffer with this problem. So when I was given the opportunity to review this product for Free, I wonder if this product would help my dry and crack skin. I used it for my hands specifically and it has worked. I feel my hands retaining their smoothness, less crack skin on my hands and around my nails. I can say it working quite well for me. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> love, love, this product will def  reorder</li>
    <li> I love this oil. The past year I have used Argan oil. Although I liked the Argan oil, I have seen better results with Rosehip oil. I love the pump dispenser of this bottle. I also prefer the 2 oz size as opposed to a 4 oz size bottle since the shelf life of Rosehip oil is approximately 6 months and quickly goes rancid if not refrigerated. Definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim rosehip seed oil is 100% organic, and it is not tested on animals. This moisturizing oil comes in a pump, instead of a dropper. I like products that dispense through a pump because I can’t accidentally spill it. The moisturizing oil is fast absorbing, and it makes my skin feel soft afterwards. I get a lot of scars when I play with my cat and he accidently scratches me. This product will come in handy. This product is good for face, neck, hair, scalp, and even nails. This moisturizing oil provides vitamin A and C, Omega 6 and 3, and antioxidant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC: I was sent this moisturizing oil for review through Tomoson. All reviews are written with 100% honesty from my own perspective.</li>
    <li> Works great! Helps make skin soft and smooth. Hydrates skin and hair, helps with acne, and can be used on nails as well! I love that it is 100% pure, organic oil. No harsh chemicals, better for your body! I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I just received this today and nearly passed out from the rancid smell. The bottle was sealed. Very disappointing. Love Foxbrim argan oil and it has no odor.</li>
