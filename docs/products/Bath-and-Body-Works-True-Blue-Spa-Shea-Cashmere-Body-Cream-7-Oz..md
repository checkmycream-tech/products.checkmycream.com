    <li> I live in the high desert of New Mexico, a dry and harsh climate for skin, so I am always looking for effective body creams and moisturizers. Been through dozens.

My skin feels soft, smooth, and nourished without being greasy. Love the smell.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more for me when these run out, and for my NM sisters as gifts.</li>

    <li> This is the VERY BEST cream on the market - in my opinion - and getting it sent to my home makes it so... convenient!!  It is even cheaper than at Bath and Body Works.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that my mother asks for every year for Christmas, and it&#x27;s one of the best products Bath and Body Works has ever made. The cream is thick but non-greasy, it spreads evenly and well, it absorbs into the skin wonderfully, and the scent is absolutely intoxicating. Mom gets compliments on it everywhere she goes. This is totally, totally worth the price. I usually buy her 3-4 jars every year. With regular use, it makes your skin glow like a teenager&#x27;s. ;)</li>
    <li> Love this product! Every time I use it, people complement me on my fragrance. Super thick but absorbing.</li>
    <li> This was the best body cream ever!!!  I cannot believe how smooth it makes your skin feel immeditaely.  Recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It is one of the most creamy body butters I have ever used. The scent is not overpowering but a sweet light fragrance that lingers gently on my skin.

This product can be a bit pricey but I try to snatch up one or two from this Bath &amp; Body works line during a sale.</li>
