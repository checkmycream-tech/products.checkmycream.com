### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but it is a staple in our shower.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair and scalp feel and look it&#x27;s best.</li>
      <li>Of all the anti-dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, this one works the best.  </li>
      <li>Punctual and affable seller!</li>
      <li>This product is an excellent choice to use.</li>
      <li>Any help you can offer would be great</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy I made the purchase.</li>
      <li>I get this stuff because its a great shampoo and for its DHT blocking properties.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s great; better than a back-order.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the result.</li>
      <li>in all, if you are attached to the Nizoral formula, I think this is a good buy - until the US version becomes available</li>
      <li>which is a better value for your money.</li>
      <li>I ordered the 60mL solution, but the seller upgraded me to the 100mL free of charge!</li>
      <li>Neutragena works better for me-but none of the $5-$10 store brands truly work for me either.</li>
      <li>Better than no Nizoral at all.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>It is better than anything out there.</li>
      <li>It might work for you, but sure didn&#x27;t for me</li>
      <li>This is a UK version made by a reputable pharma co.  </li>
      <li>: Works fine - don&#x27;t see that it is any better than the 1%</li>
      <li>But regardless, these guys sent out 2% stuff, works great from what I can tell so far, and it arrived well before the estimated arrival ship date.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, the product works.</li>
      <li>which according to the leaflet inside the package of nizoral is the primary cause of most dandruff.</li>
      <li>The process works great as long as you have the product on hand.</li>
      <li>Shipment is quick, given that it ships out of the UK.</li>
      <li>Smells unique but no worse than H&amp;S Intense and way better than Neutrogena T-gel.</li>
      <li>Pricey but worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>but this 2% Nizoral is the only effective product for me.</li>
      <li>I find this works much better to clear dandruff and keep it away.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been two weeks and most of my acne and bumps are gone and have some scars left.</li>
      <li>After the first use the itching and flaking ceased.</li>
      <li>Got exactly what I was looking for after researching on the matter.</li>
      <li>: Smells funny.</li>
      <li>nothing risky or unusual about it!</li>
      <li>The shampoo works, but if you have hair that is below shoulder length, better be prepared to only get about 5 washes out of each bottle!  </li>
      <li>I also ordered &amp;#34;DS Laboratories Revita Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo, 180 ml Bottle&amp;#34; which has Ketoconazole in it, but didn&#x27;t say how much exactly.</li>
      <li>When I order this, I was fully aware that there are 5 ml in a teaspoon</li>
      <li>I have not analyzed this product, but I can tell you it it more watery, and less effective than the American product I have used for years.</li>
      <li>For some reason (can&#x27;t find any concrete reason anywhere online), the old Nizoral is no longer available.</li>
      <li>so maybe my case is more of a dry skin problem rather than yeast-</li>
      <li>This product is pure garbage</li>
      <li>This is our first time for this product, so we won&#x27;t be able to compare it to other versions.</li>
      <li>this product is real good but rather small i used it 2 times a week then use my other shampoo.</li>
      <li>Had I bothered to really think about this</li>
      <li>Use once a for 10 days straight then once a week.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable and will continue to use this product.</li>
      <li>first, let me start by saying this stuff comes in only a 60ml bottle-which isn&#x27;t even a full 2 ounces.</li>
      <li>but it took forever to get here and on top of that I had to pay a foreign fee which appeared on my credit card.</li>
      <li>Something about a new production facility and FDA inspections and approval.</li>
      <li>No more flaky scalp. :)</li>
      <li>I finally found the dandruff shampoo after changing many other brands.</li>
      <li>dead right after the first application.</li>
      <li>So, if you have a significant amount of hair this stuff will be gone after half a dozen uses.</li>
      <li>Well, I wouldn&#x27;t complain if it fixed my dandruff problem-but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>The package arrived after a considerable wait, but it can no longer be purchased in US stores for whatever reason.  </li>
      <li>Works almost completely after the 1st  couple of treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Tried</li>
      <li>a note that during the initial use you will probably need to use daily or every other day but once the issue has stabilized you should be able to gauge the frequency of use.  </li>
      <li>It treats dandruff at te source much better than H&amp;S and Selsun Blue have for me in the past.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth the effort.</li>
      <li>Its a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>It would take 4 of these to equal tje shampoo in the old Blue Nizoral bottles.</li>
      <li>I have tried all other types of shampoos and had high hopes this would solve my problem, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Lastly I use it for my hair at least twice a week for mild dandruff that I want to control in ...</li>

<li> (Thailand) Limited, and was shipped from Thailand.</li>
<li> This bottle was manufactured by OLIC (Thailand) Limited for Johnson &amp; Johnson</li>

<li> I must have missed Amazons note that this could be subject to extra fees.</li>
<li> 1 small bottle will last for several months.</li>
<li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that its a little runny.</li>
<li> You only need a very small amount about the size of an American quarter coin.</li>
<li> I would have realized that 12 teaspoons at this cost is no better than the bottles on ebay for $90 with a much larger quantity.&lt;br</li>
<li> Tea Tree products, Head &amp; Shoulders, Neutrogena, and all the other OTC products to no avail for my problem.&lt;br</li>
<li> and it wasn&#x27;t as watered down but it did the job.</li>
<li> Frankly, it was a waste of my time and money to buy</li>
<li> so I got a few weeks out of it using sparingly.</li>
<li> For all of the ignorant Americans like myself who were raised in the 70&#x27;s and failed to completely embrace the metric system-</li>
<li> the 1% US kind is not available (very annoying btw).</li>
<li> thought I would warn other Nizoral starved customers before they spend their hard earned money.</li>
<li> I use the shampoo for veriscolor spots in my chest while I shower and after two weeks I noticed very slightly the color is fading but will take awhile.</li>
<li> there is very little in the bottle.  </li>
<li> No more itching and flaking.</li>
<li> as is a product produced in some ex-soviet republic, the bottle actually came in a weird language.</li>
<li> so I want to maintain healthy hair before it gets worst!</li>
<li> I&#x27;d say it got rid of a few flakes-but nothing to justify the ridiculous price tag.</li>
<li> Order received was shipped weeks late, from Thailand, not from UK.</li>
<li> Desperate enough to purchase shampoo from another country with a label I can&#x27;t read.&lt;br</li>
<li> crazy expensive for the amount of shampoo you get should be half that cost also they say it lasts 3 months only if your head is the size of a pin</li>
<li> Very expensive for what you get, but it does last me awhile  because I don&#x27;t use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have bad dandruff and this shampoo takes it away after using it several times.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the same as this product, but in a 100ml size: [[ASIN:B009SLN9OQ Nizoral Shampoo Ketoconazole 2% A-d Anti-dandruff and Itchy Scalp</li>
<li> Sad that we have to resort to importing this, living in the US, but shampoos containing Ketoconazole are hard to find without a prescription.  </li>
<li> This takes care of some of our family&#x27;s bad dandruff that did not respond to other OTC treatments.  </li>
<li> EXPENSIVE.</li>
<li> I am afraid of using it.&lt;br /&gt;Who know what chemicals are in it.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have bad dandruff</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After the first use the itching and flaking ceased. Smells unique but no worse than H&amp;S Intense and way better than Neutrogena T-gel.</li>
    <li> Of all the anti-dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, this one works the best.  The price is reasonable and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> It stops itching and dandruff dead right after the first application. It is better than anything out there. Nothing helped me until I found this specific Nizoral. You only need a very small amount about the size of an American quarter coin. Leave it for 4-5 minutes and rinse it off. I use it once a week. 1 small bottle will last for several months. No more itching and flaking.</li>
    <li> Works like it should. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that its a little runny. I had purchased some a while back and it wasn&#x27;t as watered down but it did the job. No more flaky scalp. :)</li>
    <li> crazy expensive for the amount of shampoo you get should be half that cost also they say it lasts 3 months only if your head is the size of a pin</li>
    <li> Order received was shipped weeks late, from Thailand, not from UK. Item was not as ordered, a fragrance version was substituted. The item had non-english script on it and was unreadable.</li>
    <li> Package arrives in 100ml bottle instead of 60ml so bonus for that! I use the shampoo for veriscolor spots in my chest while I shower and after two weeks I noticed very slightly the color is fading but will take awhile. I also use the shampoo on my face (chin and jaw) where I have hormonal acne. I wash my face and let it sit 5 minutes then wash it off. It&#x27;s been two weeks and most of my acne and bumps are gone and have some scars left. I definitely recommend trying this shampoo on your skin...nothing risky or unusual about it! Lastly I use it for my hair at least twice a week for mild dandruff that I want to control in ...I don&#x27;t have bad dandruff but occasionally there is so I want to maintain healthy hair before it gets worst! Try it and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I get this stuff because its a great shampoo and for its DHT blocking properties. I hate it that you can&#x27;t just go and buy it in the stores in the U.S. at the moment. They need to get it together! But regardless, these guys sent out 2% stuff, works great from what I can tell so far, and it arrived well before the estimated arrival ship date. No complaints, TY thai shop.</li>
    <li> Though none of us want to admit it, sometimes flakes are a problem.  This takes care of some of our family&#x27;s bad dandruff that did not respond to other OTC treatments.  It doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but it is a staple in our shower.</li>
    <li> I was unsuccessful using this product to relieve my dandruff. I have tried all other types of shampoos and had high hopes this would solve my problem, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> first, let me start by saying this stuff comes in only a 60ml bottle-which isn&#x27;t even a full 2 ounces. It&#x27;s about the equivalent of 2 or 3 single use hotel shampoo bottles. So, if you have a significant amount of hair this stuff will be gone after half a dozen uses. My hair&#x27;s only an inch long so I got a few weeks out of it using sparingly. But $20?! Well, I wouldn&#x27;t complain if it fixed my dandruff problem-but it didn&#x27;t. Not even close. I&#x27;d say it got rid of a few flakes-but nothing to justify the ridiculous price tag. Neutragena works better for me-but none of the $5-$10 store brands truly work for me either. I only get dandruff in the winter time...so maybe my case is more of a dry skin problem rather than yeast-which according to the leaflet inside the package of nizoral is the primary cause of most dandruff. It might work for you, but sure didn&#x27;t for me-so I can&#x27;t say I recommend it.</li>
    <li> For all of the ignorant Americans like myself who were raised in the 70&#x27;s and failed to completely embrace the metric system- there is very little in the bottle.  When I order this, I was fully aware that there are 5 ml in a teaspoon so this bottle holds only 12 teaspoons!  Had I bothered to really think about this I would have realized that 12 teaspoons at this cost is no better than the bottles on ebay for $90 with a much larger quantity.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, maybe J &amp; J US will get their act together and people will not have to resort to searching the world for products!</li>
    <li> Seller upgraded from 60 -&amp;#62; 100, so props for that. For some reason (can&#x27;t find any concrete reason anywhere online), the old Nizoral is no longer available. Sad that we have to resort to importing this, living in the US, but shampoos containing Ketoconazole are hard to find without a prescription.  I also ordered &amp;#34;DS Laboratories Revita Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo, 180 ml Bottle&amp;#34; which has Ketoconazole in it, but didn&#x27;t say how much exactly.</li>
    <li> The shampoo works, but if you have hair that is below shoulder length, better be prepared to only get about 5 washes out of each bottle!  I ordered two bottles and it lasted me just under 2 weeks.  It would take 4 of these to equal tje shampoo in the old Blue Nizoral bottles.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that has stopped my flaking scalp.  Works almost completely after the 1st  couple of treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Tried Tea Tree products, Head &amp; Shoulders, Neutrogena, and all the other OTC products to no avail for my problem.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but this 2% Nizoral is the only effective product for me.</li>
    <li> I used this before, then switched back to the domestic brand in the blue bottle.  This is 2% Keto versus 1% Keto for domestic. I tried it again when the 1% was not clearing my dandruff as well.  I find this works much better to clear dandruff and keep it away.  Its a little pricey, but worth it. This is a UK version made by a reputable pharma co.  There are some cheaper asian versions, which I have not tried.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair and scalp feel and look it&#x27;s best. It soothes itching. I would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I finally found the dandruff shampoo after changing many other brands. None of them worked for me. This has solved my problem after using it for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I was desperate to get some more Nizoral shampoo since for some reason the 1% US kind is not available (very annoying btw). Desperate enough to purchase shampoo from another country with a label I can&#x27;t read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Works fine - don&#x27;t see that it is any better than the 1% but nonetheless it is fine.&lt;br /&gt;  Better than no Nizoral at all.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Smells funny. The smell reminds me of the smell of Neutrogena T-Gel tar-like smell&lt;br /&gt;  EXPENSIVE. Very expensive for what you get, but it does last me awhile  because I don&#x27;t use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you are attached to the Nizoral formula, I think this is a good buy - until the US version becomes available which is a better value for your money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year now and I&#x27;m very pleased with the result. Pricey but worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Just a note that during the initial use you will probably need to use daily or every other day but once the issue has stabilized you should be able to gauge the frequency of use.  Not everyone is the same so I will defer that on your judgement.</li>
    <li> To my fellow customers...I have used Nizoral for years...the American product, which is blue in color and has .5 percent kenoconazole. The product shipped  by this company is red in color, and supposedly contains twice the strength, i.e. 1.0 kenoconazole. I am not a chemist...I have not analyzed this product, but I can tell you it it more watery, and less effective than the American product I have used for years. Frankly, it was a waste of my time and money to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just thought I would warn other Nizoral starved customers before they spend their hard earned money.</li>
    <li> Although chosing a medicated shampoo is a personal decision, this brand works prefectly for me. After using it twice, I can feel a reduction in the amount of itchiness and scales. Shipment is quick, given that it ships out of the UK. It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth the effort.</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I was looking for after researching on the matter. Punctual and affable seller! I ordered the 60mL solution, but the seller upgraded me to the 100mL free of charge! Most importantly, the product works. It treats dandruff at te source much better than H&amp;S and Selsun Blue have for me in the past. Thank you again.</li>
    <li> This product is an excellent choice to use. I have bad dandruff and this shampoo takes it away after using it several times.</li>
    <li> Ordered this 60ml product on Mar. 3.  Received something on Mar. 22, but with a note saying \\&quot;Out of stock on the 60ml, sent you 100ml for the same price.\\&quot;  That&#x27;s great; better than a back-order. However, I did not receive the UK version of the product as pictured and reviewed by others.  This bottle was manufactured by OLIC (Thailand) Limited for Johnson &amp; Johnson (Thailand) Limited, and was shipped from Thailand. It&#x27;s the same as this product, but in a 100ml size: [[ASIN:B009SLN9OQ Nizoral Shampoo Ketoconazole 2% A-d Anti-dandruff and Itchy Scalp (200ml)]]&lt;br /&gt;The product I received never saw the UK. Will update the review after it&#x27;s actually been used. This is our first time for this product, so we won&#x27;t be able to compare it to other versions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched far and wide, for this is the only dandruff shampoo that has helped my mate but it took forever to get here and on top of that I had to pay a foreign fee which appeared on my credit card. I must have missed Amazons note that this could be subject to extra fees. Like the product hate the fees.</li>
    <li> Company did not have the 60 ml size anymore and bumped it up to 100 ml for free.&lt;br /&gt;Do not have to use a lot at a time so it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The package arrived after a considerable wait, but it can no longer be purchased in US stores for whatever reason.  It worked like a charm and I&#x27;m happy I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> wish I could get the blue bottle US version of this product, but too hard to find at a decent price.  This will do for the time being.</li>
    <li> as is a product produced in some ex-soviet republic, the bottle actually came in a weird language. I am afraid of using it.&lt;br /&gt;Who know what chemicals are in it. I wish Amazon only soled pharmeceuticals and skin products made/regulated int her USA</li>
    <li> Its has been weeks now. Ia am wondering if the order will ever arrive. Any help you can offer would be great</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I HAVE THE WORSTE DANDRUFF EVER&amp;#34;  iv tried every thing from lime juice to apple cider vinegar to all STORE BRANDS. this product is real good but rather small i used it 2 times a week then use my other shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product is pure garbage and it&#x27;s not 2% like the product claims it is. If you go to Walgreens they can order the orginal Nizoral for you.</li>
    <li> J&amp;J has production issues with the blue bottle shampoo in the US. Something about a new production facility and FDA inspections and approval. Meanwhile, we Americans must buy our Nizoral from overseas vendors. My bottle came from Thailand. it took a lil while but the supplier ran out of the 60ml bottle and sent me a 100ml bottle 6 STARS for him. Use once a for 10 days straight then once a week. The initial 10 days subdues the fungus and the weekly application keeps it away. The process works great as long as you have the product on hand.</li>
