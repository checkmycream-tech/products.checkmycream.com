<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love Soaking in Epsom Salts so I was pretty excited to try the Dead Sea Salts. One. Factor, I  really like the benefits of using skin care products that contain minerals from the Dead Sea. Just their relaxing properties are reason enough to try them out.&lt;br /&gt;They also have a Much Higher Mineral Concentration than Epsom Salt! with a High Concentration of Minerals which are Essential for Proper Skin Health and Beauty&lt;br /&gt;I started using this as soon as I received it and I&#x27;m being completely honest when I say I love this product! As soon as you emerge yourself into the water you immediately start relaxing and feel like a thousand pounds of weight has been lifted off your shoulders. I suffer from major back issues and soaking in the Dead Sea salts made a huge difference.  I had little pain while soaking and wished I had a bigger tub cause I could have lived in that water. I have never felt so relaxed.  This is a great product and I  believe you should definitely try it for yourself. You will love it! Check out the full review on my blog. http://myblog.thebeautyinsidethebox.com/2015/01/adovia-dead-sea-salt.html?m&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> When I received my Adovia Dead Sea Salt I was immediately impressed by the size of the bag. For the price, it contains a lot of Dead Sea Salt. I also like how the bag is resealable – this is very useful for easy storage. I drew myself a bath and added 1 cup of the Salts and a few drops of Lemon Oil (just for the scent). The salt dissolved very quickly, unlike Epsom salt. When I got into my bath I could feel the softness of the water on my skin. The bath was relaxing, and after my bath my skin definitely felt softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hubby suffers from lower bag pain and various other pains so he was eager to try a Dead Sea Salt bath as well. As soon as I got out he drew himself a bath. I added a cup of salt and a few drops of Lemon Oil. He laid in the tub for 20 minutes and relaxed. Near the end of his bath he said he felt “tingly.” After his bath he took a shower, and when he got out he still said he felt “tingly.” I asked if it was “tingly in a good way?” and he said “no!” I have no idea why he felt tingly. He did say he would give it another shot some other time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a simple recipe to make a sea salt body scrub:&lt;br /&gt;  1 cup salt&lt;br /&gt;  1/2 cup carrier oil&lt;br /&gt;  10 drops Peppermint (or other essential oil – just for scent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to trying the Adovia Dead Sea Salt in a scrub as well.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Although hubby wouldn’t necessarily recommend this product, I sure would! If you like taking baths, or if you like making DIY body scrubs, I would definitely recommend Adovia Dead Sea Salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
    <li> The Adovia Dead Sea Salt is a soothing, energizing, unvigorating dead sea salt that has been used of hundreds of centuries for the well being and alluvuation of body aches and pains as well as skin health conditions such as severely dry skin and itchiness. Psoriasis, dermatits, eczema, , arthritis, fibromyliasia, insomnia and even stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the adovia dead sea salt as a exfoliator. I put extra virgen oil and sime dead sea salts and U put it un my face for a exfoluation experience. I use in a circular upward motion for maxumym results  These salts removes impurities and blackheads and gives you a smoother, texturized and toned face. You will definetly feel a remarkable diffrence in your face as you rinse your face and get rid of all the dead cells that was munutes earlier in your face. You will see a more luminous facial appearance and the noticeable results you will see qhen you start doing this. One of my othwr favorite place to apply these salts to exfoluate is in my neck, chest, feet and yes!!!! even my now beautiful hands. your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Adovia dead sea mineraluzed salt can be poured in your tub for a realaxation out of this workd. Your muscles will be very relaxed and you will feel the invigoration experince as if though you stepped out of a spa but for much less tthe price of one. You owe it to yourself to pamper yourself like the prince or princess that you are. Let this dead sea salt captivate your inner and outter senses. You will feel more  aluve than you have in many years. This dead sea salt will suppress anxiety and give you a peace if mind and contentment. Keep your body fully hydrated:))))))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yoy are so wekcomed to add drops of lavender, peppermint oil, olive oil, rosehip oil, vitamin c for maxium mousture and hydration.</li>
    <li> Most babies love their baths, and we do too Mama! Who doesn’t love the warm water, bubbles, sea salts? Speaking of sea salts, I recently started using them after learning how good they are for your body. Did you know it can provide relief from Psoriasis, Eczema, and Arthritis symptoms? I received the Adovia Dead Sea Bath Salt from Adovia Mineral Skin Care and it’s wonderful. It’s 100% genuine and pure with a high concentration of minerals which are essential for proper skin health and beauty. It doesn’t have any scent or color. It’s a great product for moms who want to relax after a long day, and even better for those who suffer minor aches and pains. Just soak in a bath full of these salts, Mama and let them exfoliate and soften your skin.</li>
    <li> A nice relaxing bath is one of my favorite escapes that help me relax and rejuvenated. I like to add bath salts in my bath to help with that and this one is one of the best. I feel like my skin is extremely soft after getting out of a bath using this and my body is very relaxed. I have a lot of body aches and pains and this winter has been a killer. Taking a nice relaxing bath with this has helped a lot my back muscles feel well relaxed and wasn&#x27;t as sore. I felt looser and not as stiff after I took a bath with these bath salts. They don&#x27;t have a strong scent to them either which is nice so I can add my own essential oils to this. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
    <li> I am a major bath taker during the winter and I love bath salts. So, I was excited to try Adovia dead sea salt. I usually go with some kind of epsom salt mix if I have it on hand. Since moving to a new city, my baths have sucked.  Water quality in Southern California isn&#x27;t the greatest and I just have a hard time relaxing in the the tub. I have used this twice in my bath and it&#x27;s incredible. Within a couple of minutes all my muscles are relaxed and I could seriously go to bed. It&#x27;s super calming for the body. I was shocked at the difference between my bath time before the Adovia now. Great stuff! I would love it if they had a break down of the minerals it contained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I read a review that someone used Adovia as a facial scrub! I am so going to try that! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Taking showers is more convenient and fast when you have little ones depending on you, but a warm bath in the bathtub is more relaxing and needed once in a while. So I took this opportunity to try out the Adovia Bath Salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I gathered the supplies needed for my bath, I let the warm water run over 2 cups of Adovia Dead Sea Salt. The salt dissolved fast since it is fine grained. By the time I was ready to soak all I could feel was the relaxing sensation of mineral packed tub of warm water. I have no idea how long I was there, but enough to put me to sleep after I was done. I continued my bath using the Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap and after I dried off I wanted to see how my skin feels. Not only that my whole body felt relaxed, but my skin feel smooth too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer some aroma to your bath you can add some drops of lavender or peppermint oil in the water.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to skin conditions. It has a high concentration of minerals, which is very helpful for problematic skin. It is also well suited for Eczema and Psoriasis. This is why I LOVE adding this Pure Dead Sea Bath Salts when I take my baths. I periodically suffer from dermatitis and severely dry skin and this product has helped me and my skin sensitivity tremendously. It&#x27;s also wonderful for soothing aching limbs. This product will be staple in my bathroom moving forward and will remain so for years to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> After using these a couple times so far, I must say I like these better than epsom salts. I love how quickly they dissolve, and are great to use for unwinding and for stiff muscles and aches and pains. I&#x27;ve had back and hip pain lately, and this really does seem to help. I also like how this product is free from additives or scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  With this product you could use it like it is, or also add some of your own essential oils.  I plan on trying it soon with lavender oil for a calming effect. You could also make your own homemade salt scrub with this item, and there are many recipes online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Overall I really like this product, and would recommend it to almost anyone. It has so many benefits that I think it would be great for anyone. The only thing I found is there isn&#x27;t any directions or instructions on The Adovia Bath Salts Package. I did however find it on there site as I listed above,and that they recommend using 1 cup per bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I did receive this item for free to review, however all opinions are 100% my own and not influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> This Dead Sea Salt buffs, softens, and hydrates skin to absolute perfection! I am in need of a holiday and this is the next best thing! If a dream vacation were bottled up into a product, this salty scrub would be it. It has the feel of a sandy beach, and the salty, zesty scent of an ocean breeze. One scoop buffs away dry, flaky skin anywhere on your body, leaving skin smooth and hydrated thanks to it&#x27;s conditioning properties. While it is gentle enough to use on your face, the gritty texture and may cause irritation, so those with sensitive skin should probably use with caution. I am actually going to use the sea salt as a base for a scrub and add avocado butter, grapefruit extract, coconut oil,  and lime oil  - that&#x27;s what is great about this sea salt it has countless options you can use it. *Note I was given this for review and my review friends is unbiased!*</li>
    <li> Perfect for sore feet! I really enjoyed the soothing bath salts! Perfect gift for anyone! I loved using these during my pedicure.</li>
    <li> Recently, several of us in my family have started trying natural remedies, including oils, spices, and all natural products to treat various problems. Epsom salts are always in the house, and I remember even my grandmother using them when I was young! So it wasn’t a far jump to give this Adovia Dead Sea Salt product a shot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most basic use of this type of product is to add it to warm water and soak the injured/sore spot if not submerge your body in the tub and enjoy the relief all over. Alternatively, you can also soak just your feet, elbows, etc if those are the areas that are hurting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These salt crystals are very fine, so I found they dissolved very easily in the hot water. Plus, historically speaking, dead sea salts have been used for centuries for a range of ailments, including insomnia, psoriasis, arthritis, circulation problems, and even menstral cramps! I’m not a doctor, so I can’t say this is the ultimate treatment everyone should use, but in my own research, it does seem to be a potentially powerful ingredient on the path to natural health and wellness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you don’t just have to soak in it! You can make scrubs with it by adding just a few drops of your favorite essential oils. These make great gifts for loved ones, especially if you put them in a cute jar or bottle with a small set of instructions attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re like me and trying to find healthier alternatives to the endless pills, creams, and other harsh, chemical filled products, you may find that the Adovia dead sea salt bag to be a great purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! So much better than Epson salts! I love how the bag is resealable as well! I did receive this product complimentary from the seller for my unbiased opioion</li>
    <li> After returning home from vacation, my feet were sore as all get out! I was super happy to try this product! The sea salts left my feet feeling soft! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love them. At first I was a little worried I might screw something up since this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used bath salts while on a septic tank, but they dissolved perfectly. I didn&#x27;t feel any grainy residue or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salt comes in a nice Zip Loc- like bag which is perfect for storing in the bathroom or wherever you plan on using it. You can see everything in the bag, so you know it&#x27;s just the awesome salt inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since there are no real measuring instructions, I just sort of wing it when I use it and everything works out great. It helps feel smoother coming out. Lately I&#x27;ve had terrible eczema on elbow (what a nightmareish place to get it!) and the itching is driving me up a wall. You see, itchy things are my weakness. I can take pain and discomfort, but make me itchy and I HAVE to scratch! Using the salts has helped keep it under control. Definitely a life saver for that alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this awesome bath salt!</li>
    <li> After a week or so of not sleeping well, I was delighted to indulge in a relaxing bath filled with the Adovia Genuine Dead Sea Salts.  A warm bath often helps relax me before bed, but it helps when I have an additive like the Adovia Genuine Dead Sea Salts in my bath water.  The water in my neighborhood is from a rural well and many people in the area have a water softener.  I don&#x27;t have one, so I appreciate what these salts can do for my skin and the overall body effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kicked up the wonderful benefits of the Dead Sea Salts and made a Vanilla Bean &amp; Sea Salt Body Scrub.  If you think the Dead Sea Salts are good for your skin, just wait until you use the sea salt body scrub.  It&#x27;s like the old Bryl cream, a little dab will do ya!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review. All opinions are true and my own.&lt;br /&gt;http://dealsfrommsdo.com/?p&#x3D;62731</li>
    <li> *I received the following product for free in exchange for my unbiased review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is more relaxing than a luxurious bath at home. I, for one, love using bath salts not only in my baths but also in a relaxing foot soak. My only problem is finding good bath salts to use! Some can be so gritty and feel slimy when in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These 100% Dead Sea Bath Salts by Adovia are absolutely phenomenal. They have a great texture that makes a bath what it should be: relaxing. These salts are great for exfoliating the skin and leaving your body feeling fresh and renewed. What I particularly like about these dead sea salt crystals is that while they help with exfoliation, they also help with acne which my skin has been known to be prone to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of benefits in these crystals that you just cannot find anywhere else. My first impression was &amp;#34;Oh, Cool, it&#x27;s salt&amp;#34; because I did not know any better. Dead sea salt contains calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium (obviously) and bromides. What I didn&#x27;t know was how beneficial these minerals are. Calcium helps strengthen bones and nails while preventing water retention and increasing circulation. Magnesium helps slow down skin aging while calming the nervous system (i.e. relaxation). Potassium helps balance the skins moisture and energizes the body. Sodium is important for the immune system. Bromides help relax and relieve muscle soreness and stiffness. With so many beneficial ingredients, it&#x27;s no wonder I loved this product from the very first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to just use these salt crystals for soaks or baths, you can make your very own facial scrubs out of them as well. I am what I would call a &#x27;Pinterest Addict&#x27; and I usually pin a lot of DIY facial scrubs but never actually do them myself. Yes, I am guilty of pinning and never actually doing. However, I might be reconsidering this pinning lifestyle choice and actually make some homemade scrubs with my lovely dead sea salt crystals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These crystals are a decent size and are gritty, as they should be. They certainly help your body and muscles relax. They are terrific for exfoliation and getting rid of acne. What more could you want for a beauty product?omemade scrubs with my lovely dead sea salt crystals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These crystals are a decent size and are gritty, as they should be.

    <li> pretty good stuff and it saved me $$$</li>
    <li> High quality salts. Worked great with my soap projects! Will def buy again, Thnx!!</li>
    <li> My husband loved these salts.  He mixes them with epsom salts for pain relief baths.</li>
    <li> Such nice quality Dead Sea bath salt. It makes my bath water feel like silk. I&#x27;ve also used this to mix into some home made bath bombs and WOW! It makes them so wonderful!</li>
    <li> In love with this amazing product! Makes my skin feel so soft and relaxes my tired feet and legs after standing for 12 hours. I have already bought a huge shipment of this stuff. I have super sensitive skin and this has helped to clear my acne and cleanse my entire body.</li>
    <li> love mixing with coconut oil for a face wash</li>
    <li> I am already a loyal user of other Adovia’s Dead Sea products like their facial mud mask and moisturizing soap. So, when I was asked to test Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Bath Salts, I was thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My chance came after the July 4th weekend. I spent several days prior to the holiday cleaning and preparing for a houseful of guests. The weekend included family dinners, day trips, and even a few somewhat raucous late (late!) nights on the patio. By Monday, when the house cleared out, I was thoroughly exhausted. A long, uninterrupted soak in the tub was just what I needed and gave me the perfect opportunity to try Adovia’s Dead Sea Bath Salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found was the bath salts deliver as promised… and then some!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They contain no additives, colors, or scents, so they work beautifully in combination with essential oils. Since I really needed to relax, I chose lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also have a very fine grain, so they fully dissolved before I even stepped into the tub. There was no uncomfortable, gritty salt layer on the bottom of the tub, like I’ve had with some bath products (especially inexpensive ones, which can have huge grains -- ouch!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adovia Dead Sea Bath Salts promise that a soak will help you find relief from aches and pains and rejuvenate you. And, after a 20 minute soak (with a glass of wine!) I felt oh-so-relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 STARS!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I put some in while taking a bath, and within in 10 minutes I was completely relaxed, my lower back pains were gone and I was amazed. I have never used bath salts before. And after this experience I am mad at myself for missing out. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I use this in my homemade bath salts and it is wonderful. Small enough that it dissolves quickly. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> a large amount in the bag.......a beautiful price....and I had a wonderful soak using this&lt;br /&gt;Adovia Dead Sea Salt.  Thanks for a good product.</li>
    <li> These are dead sea salts are amazing. It is similar to Epsom Salt but not really. the minerals in more concentrated than with regular Epsom salt. With the high concentration of minerals the better and healthier it is for your skin. I loved using this and my skin after getting out felt so soft. Not only can you use this for softer skin but you can use this to help with one health problem eczema. I will keep an eye on that because that runs in the family. I have super dry patch on my elbows. As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I got this free to try and it makes baths much more relaxing. It is full of minerals so it&#x27;s great for your skin and with a nice soak it can dull aches. You can make a salt scrub to exfoliate your skin or you can also add essential oils for stress relieving baths</li>
    <li> I bought dead sea salt to try to help with itching caused by puppp (pregnancy rash). I had tried a myriad of other things and no luck. While it hasn&#x27;t made it go away, it has made it bearable. I have been doing soaks in the sea salt multiple times per day and rubbing it into my skin. Amazingly, my skin is still pretty soft. It dissolves quickly in the bath. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and have already ordered a second one.</li>
    <li> Perfect Product!&lt;br /&gt;We have a 2 year old baby girl that lately suffers from excema. My 17 year old son had the same when he was around this age and I remembered that after using al kind of creams subscribed by the doctor with no good results, I just went for the natural way. I bought dead sea salt and a natural cream from a reform shop, also with dead sea salt in it. The problem was solved very fast and his excema very rarely comes back. He has none at all now. So I went on amazon to look for dead sea salt to try it with my daughter too. I love this one! after one soak bath for her, her skin improved so much! now after the second bath its almost gone!! My husband loves it too and told me to order another one, because this seems a great solution and a great salt! higly recommend it!! ( in the mean time I will secretly enjoy a dead sea salt bath myself too now and then;) )</li>
    <li> Excelent product. Thank u.</li>
    <li> Great product! Feels good in the bath water!</li>
    <li> This mineral bath salts dissolve completely in water and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth. It also comes in a sealable pouch which makes storing easy.   I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free</li>
    <li> I adore a great foot soak, years ago I picked up one of those plug in foot massagers and it sat in my closet until I got rid of it when I used one time in two years. But now I figured out it was not the cheap massager that I was enjoying but the hot water on my feet. I used these Adovia Mineral Dead Sea Bath Salts dissolved in hot water with a few drops of lavender oil. I love these salts and hope to continue to learn new ways to use these bath salts in conjunction with my collection of essential oils.

    <li> This stuff is amazing. I put  some in while taking a bath, and within in 10 minutes I was completely relaxed, my lower back pains were gone and I was amazed. I have never used bath salts before. And after this experience I am mad at myself for missing out. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I have not used this product yet, but plan to purchase if I&#x27;m able to find out from the company where their dead sea salts are sourced. Some areas of the waters are now becoming so polluted that I&#x27;m not 100% sure on this product yet. I&#x27;m currently awaiting an answer from Adovia. Although Adovia claims the Dead Sea is free of pollutants, research says certain areas are becoming more dangerous. If you&#x27;re looking for 100% pure salts, the source is the kicker...the Jordan River is the primary source to the dead sea and is very polluted. Yes I realize it all flows into one major water source and becomes less concentrated, but I&#x27;d rather have salts from a safer side of the dead sea since you have Israel and Jordan bordering what is actually a lake, not a sea. Lakes have tributaries and that&#x27;s a concern in general to the environment. Just Google Dead Sea pollution...sad. Sorry if this is confusing. I&#x27;m barely awake. Just something to think about!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to test out a bag of dead sea salts from Adovia. My son suffers from recurring joint pain in his knees and wrist (due to a soccer injury), I have chronic neck / back pain and tension, and my baby girl has a mild case of eczema that pops up on her upper arms and thighs occasionally and I thought we could all enjoy a chance to soak in some waters enriched with these salts. They are wonderful for soaking, but also for homemade body scrub! I have really gotten into essential oils for skin / body / mind care lately and already had some peppermint essential oil in my cabinet along with some almond oil, so I combined those along with a good dose of Rosehip Oil for my blend: about 1 cup sea salts, a full dropper of peppermint essential oil (10 plus drops, add until it reaches the scent you want - or use any other essential oil scent you prefer), a full dropper of Rosehip Oil (about 10 - 15 drops), and about 1/4 cup of almond oil (more / less to reach the consistency you want for your scrub). Mix these up in a resealable jar or container and enjoy the sensation of fresh sea salt scrubbed skin every day! I received a free bag of these pure dead sea salt bath salts for the purpose of review.</li>
    <li> Over the past few months I have really been into making my own salt scrubs to use in the bath. You can buy these from stores, but you never know exactly what is in it, how much, and it can cost a pretty penny. I have been using the Adovia Dead Sea Salt to make my very own salt scrub, and I honestly will never spend the money on a store bought scrub again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix my salt with essential oils, and carrier oils for the perfect mix of exfoliation, moisturizing, and fragrance. This salt is perfect size to use as a body scrub, it&#x27;s not too large like many scrubs, yet its not too fine. It&#x27;s the perfect happy medium. I like to make up a fresh batch once a week, so it is fantastic that this salt comes in a resealable pouch.There is also enough product to last me for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now onto the big question, the benefits from using this dead sea salt. I have found that my skin feels naturally clean after using. Any dry, flaky patches are removed gently, and with steady use (about 3 times a week) those dry patches are going away. Right now where I live it is currently the dead of winter, and my skin has been freaking out. There were 3 dry flaky patches on one of my knees that was driving me nuts. I have been using the scrub that I make using this salt on it for 2 weeks or so, and the patches have completely gone away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a solid fan of this product, so much that I plan to use this salt to make up batches of my salt scrub and give it away as gifts. I know my friends and family who like products like that will love my homemade salt scrub! This without a doubt gets 5 stars from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> I love to take long relaxing baths so I knew it would be great to try it.  On occasion I use Epsom Salt when bathing to relax but don&#x27;t really feel any difference.  It&#x27;s time for change I guess.  I decided to use the Adovia Dead Sea Bath Salts the day I got them.  I comes in a resealable 1.75 pound pouch.  I ran a warm bath and sprinkled a couple of Tablespoons of Bath Salts in my water before getting in.  As soon as I inserted my foot into the bath water I could immediately feel the softness in the water.  It was a relaxing long bath!  With just one use I could feel the difference of softness on my skin.  I have a patch of eczema on the back of my neck and it isn&#x27;t as dry as before.  I just know it was so relaxing and I slept so good that night.  I think I will have another bath night tonight so I can use the Adovia Dead Sea Bath Salts.&lt;br /&gt;All reviews, whether self-purchased or provided for review, will be completely honest.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use this for my DIY body scrub and it works phenomenally. It makes my skin super-soft. Here is the recipe I use, if you would like to give it a try:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup of Adovia Dead Sea Bath Salts (8 tablespoons)&lt;br /&gt;4 tablespoons of Almond Oil (any carrier oil)&lt;br /&gt;1 teaspoon of Vitamin E Oil (as a preservative)&lt;br /&gt;6-10 drops of Peppermint Oil (not mandatory, you can skip this step altogether or use any essential oil or fragrance you prefer), it&#x27;s just more enjoyable because it smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will want to avoid getting water into your mixture (bacteria), so don&#x27;t stand under running water when you are exfoliating. I usually turn off the shower and scrub-a-dub-dub, then shower as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item received in exchange for review. All reviews, whether self-purchased or provided for review, will be completely honest.</li>
    <li> We suffer from Eczema in my house bad. Also my husband currently has a ankle injury that is taking forever to heal. He has a lot of pain with that after he has worked long hard days at the factory. While I have been using the bath salts for my eczema, Joe has also been using these bath salts daily for foot/ankle soaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use in a full tub I put 1 full cup of the salt in there and let them dissolve before I get in.  When I get in, it is super relaxing. You do get a kinda of ocean salt smell its kind of strong, but I expected that these are Dead Sea Salts. I soaked for about 20 minutes give or take, and then let the water drain finishing off but a rinse in the shower. I have only been using the Salts about 2 times a week and its keeping my eczema at bay. I feel less itchy overall and soft. My feet thank these salts for sure. I had about a full layer or two of dead skin come off of them after my first soak. You get that nice relaxed breathable feeling after using these, its hard to describe. Your skin can breath again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when my husband was using the salts as a foot soak for his injured ankle, he also said that it was very relaxing. It also said that it would reduce the swelling and the pain making it easier for him to go to bed at night. Normally he would have a hard time getting his ankle comfortable enough to fall asleep. After using the salts he had no problem. This will be our go to product for Joe&#x27;s ankle injury now he just loves the Adovia dead sea bath salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both would recommend this product to anyone with a injury like Joe&#x27;s ankle injury and also to anyone looking for a great bath salt  for everyday soaks. Very relaxing!</li>
    <li> i used the salts to make a shower scrub since sadly i don&#x27;t have a bath tub. its one part vegan soap and 2 parts salt with a tiny bit of rosehip seed oil 5 drops and mix made the most perfect shower scrub i have ever had the pleasure of having, i&#x27;m marking this not only under beauty but health as well as fashion because you can use this to make gifts for people as well! no scent from it makes it even more perfect lots of people have skin conditions who can not use products with perfumes so this would be perfect for not just them but men as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This works so good.  Am always keep in the house.</li>
    <li> I gave this Dead Sea Salt a try and oh man! I love it, I took a soaking bath with the salts instead of my Epson Salt, I do have to say the pain relief and the feeling of my skin was really good compared to Epson.  I will be purchasing this again in the future as I used also for a facial scrub and body scrub and left my skin feeling so soft. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> If I could give this more than five starts, I would. I have been struggling with a weird skin condition on my back that causes little patches of dry skin to appear . I&#x27;ve gone to and get inflamed if I do or eat something wrong. They&#x27;re not incredibly bad, but they&#x27;re bad enough to cause scarring. I&#x27;ve gone to the doctors for it and all they&#x27;ve done is prescribe me with a topical steroid cream--which, by the way, has not helped. I abhor having to depend on chemically-ridden products and dreaded having to use the prescribed cream. I sought out to find a better, more natural solution for the dryness and have read that all-natural dead sea salt with trace minerals can do wonders for the skin. So, when I came across this product, I couldn&#x27;t help but to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these salts for a little over a week now and this stuff has helped TREMENDOUSLY with the dry patches. I have been taking baths every night religiously and pouring about a quarter cup of the salts with a couple drops of pure lavender oil in with the water. It dissolves quickly and it softens the water, which I appreciate because the water in my building is hard due to old pipes. With over a week of usage, here is the rundown on what I&#x27;ve noticed with my skin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The dry patches on my back are softening up and are naturally getting moisturized&lt;br /&gt;2) The skin on the rest of my body has noticeably gotten softer&lt;br /&gt;3) I don&#x27;t have to put on any kind of moisturizer after I&#x27;m done bathing&lt;br /&gt;4) The blemishes on my back are fading&lt;br /&gt;5) The soles of my feet do not need to be buffed as often due to dead skin buildup&lt;br /&gt;6) The overall appearance of my skin tone have evened out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am incredibly happy with this product, especially because I have found a natural way to relieve the weird patches of dry skin on my back. I feel better knowing that I&#x27;m not putting any dangerous chemicals onto my skin and will not have to further depend on creams and medication. Iwill continue to use these bath salts in hopes of seeing more improvements. So far, it&#x27;s done wonders for my body and I look forward to getting more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received goPure Naturals dead sea bath salts at a heavily discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. Although this review is sponsored, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this 6 stars. This is far better than any bath soak or epsom salt. Leaves your skin soft, smooth and full of moisture. I leave the bathtub feeling refreshed and relaxed. LOVE THIS STUFF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this c/o but all thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Great product. I added this + peppermint oil to a hot bath to relax after a long day of work. I&#x27;m hoping to see this fix some skin flaws I have since this has some benefits to it. It leaves your skin feeling so soft.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous bath salts and one of my biggest complaints is that they leave behind a greasy residue on my skin and my bathtub (which is porcelain and it makes it super slick!). Who wants to scrub a tub after they&#x27;ve relaxed?? I sure don&#x27;t! The Adovia Dead Sea Bath Salts left my skin feeling super smooth like I had been to an expensive spa - without the added cost! I suffer from Fibromyalgia and I experienced a good amount of relief from the pain I suffer after soaking in a bath right before bed. I highly recommend these bath salts for anyone who has any kind of muscle/joint pain!</li>
    <li> I have received this product completely free to try from Tomoson and opinions are 100 percent my own. These bath salts are amazing. I love taking baths, and bath salts soothe me even more. It&#x27;s really nice because i also feel connected to my heritage because these are from the dead sea and i&#x27;m going to israel soon to actually float in the dead sea!</li>
    <li> I like to use Epson Salts and Bath Salts both for soaking my feet and for baths when my body is sore or I just need to relax. Often times I buy premade mixtures or just use Epson salts alone depending on my mood and current need. Lately I’ve been trying to personalize my stuff with oils that fit my skins needs and scents that I prefer. I got these Dead Sea salts for free* to try and review and feel that they worked pretty well. They are supposed to be better for you than the other types because they have more minerals in them that might help with various skin ailments. You can use them alone or mix them up with some oils and make your own special bath mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package I got was really weird because it had no labels on it what so ever, I’m sure it was supposed to have one so maybe it got peeled off somewhere in manufacturing , shipping and storage. It was just weird though… The package itself was a plastic bag, clear on one side so that you can see the product inside. It was vacuum sealed when it arrived and is resalable with a zip lock top once you have cut the bag open.  I like this because sometimes when I have bought various types of salts in the past they come in cardboard containers and if you store them in your bathroom moisture gets in from the air and hardens the salt into chunks that you have to break back down to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teenage daughter hurt her knee years ago and it&#x27;s an ongoing injury that continues to plague her. Right after I received these it flared up again because she was pushing herself to hard in PE and school, she was sent home by the school nurse for the day. Since the nurse had already had her sitting for awhile with ice on it, I mixed her up some of these Dead Sea salts, Argan oil and some peppermint essential oil. I told her to draw a bath as hot as she could stand and add this mixture and relax for a bit. She did and enjoyed it, the salts dissolved quickly into the water and she said that the bath helped to calm and relax her and though it couldn&#x27;t relieve all the pain in the knee she did feel that it wasn&#x27;t hurting as bad after the bath. She would like me to make the mixture for her again in the future when she is sore and in need of a good relaxing soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the salts in an exfoliating scrub that I mixed using the salts, some Argan oil and lemon essential oil. Next I want to try it with peppermint! It worked really well, the salts mix into the oils but don&#x27;t dissolve unless they are actually put into water so I was able to use this to scrub my skin to exfoliate it. The thing I like about these salts is with no scent you can use them just like that when needed for sensitive skin, or you can mix it with other things and not worry about it tinting what you are mixing it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I didn&#x27;t really notice that these worked any better than Epson salts I would be willing to purchase them again and use them in place for Epson salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of getting this item for free this is my 100% honest opinionlax her and though it couldn&#x27;t relieve all the pain in the knee she did feel that it wasn&#x27;t hurting as bad after the bath. She would like me to make the mixture for her again in the future when she is sore and in need of a good relaxing soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the salts in an exfoliating scrub that I mixed using the salts, some Argan oil and lemon essential oil. Next I want to try it with peppermint! It worked really well, the salts mix into the oils but don&#x27;t dissolve unless they are actually put into water so I was able to use this to scrub my skin to exfoliate it. The thing I like about these salts is with no scent you can use them just like that when needed for sensitive skin, or you can mix it with other things and not worry about it tinting what you are mixing it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I didn&#x27;t really notice that these worked any better than Epson salts I would be willing to purchase them again and use them in place for Epson salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of getting this item for free this is my 100% honest opinion</li>
    <li> I was glad to try try Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Salt in my bath! When I poured the salts into my bath water, they dissolved without difficulty. Between the warm soaking water in my bathtub and the Adovia Dead Sea salts, I was soothed! I suffer from chronic back pain and fibromyalgia, and boy, I felt relaxed and calmer after my bath! My skin was soft, not dry! I actually appreciated that the salts didn&#x27;t really have a scent to them! (Some bath salts do and I try to deter from them!) I think that my son might have used them at one time to help with his chronic back pain, and they helped him, too!</li>
    <li> After receiving the product as part of a promotion, I had been a little concerned about the packaging since it didn’t have any description that I had read from the promotion and the amazon product page. It makes me think maybe there’s something wrong for why it isn’t being displayed on the bag for the product. However I am aware certain products don’t have to have ingredients listed and such, but if this was on the shelf in a store I probably wouldn’t buy it without that information on there due to my own precaution when buying things that are suppose to help my body health. There’s also no instructions of how to use this product. I know I could use as a scrub to use in the bathtub yet no information of how much I am suppose to apply or pour into it is there. I’ve only used what knowledge I have from using CVS brand epsom salt which is pretty much pouring in the whole thing into the bath tub. The dead sea salt dissolves fairly quickly when I poured it in. The amount of the product can either be seen neutrally with how frequently you’d run out of it. If you use as much as I did(beyond a cup or two of it), then chances are you’ll have about three baths with one bag of this specific quantity of dead sea salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I had taken my relaxing bath(aka spent two hours napping in the bath), my fiance had surprise he was at my soft skin; I had originally forgotten that dead sea salt could make skin soft. I’m not sure how well it impacted my eczema since it was only a few times I’ve used it unlike the epsom salt experiences I had as a child which would be an every day situation of epsom salt baths. It did smooth those rough patches as far as I noticed but didn’t eliminate it. It would have been awesome if it did but it wasn’t dramatic results. I would rightfully assume if this is better than epsom salt then it should do more impact when it’s used on a daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again but probably in a larger quantity since I usequite a large chunk of this product on the first go around. I doubt there are fragranced bath salt made by Adovia but if there was, I’d probably buy that as well once I know it won’t effect my sensitive skin.

    <li> This Dead Sea salt is really great for your skin.  It is a great exfoliant and helps make my skin so smooth and soft.  It has nice big crystals and is fab for making homemade scrubs as well as just putting into the bath water.</li>
    <li> I used to take Epson salt baths all the time and these Dead Sea salts are more relaxing than anything I&#x27;ve used in a very long time. Out with bubbles in with Seas Salt.</li>
    <li> I found the Adovia bath salts to be very soothing and relaxing while soaking in them in the tub. They dissolved quickly and are said to be 100% pure. They are great if you love to relax and soak in the tub. Very relaxing!</li>
    <li> I am a long distance triathlete.  As I have gotten older I realize that I seem to hurt a little more after my training sessions.  Enter Adovia Dead Sea Salts.  I pour a cup full in a tub of hot water and soak for the recommended 20 minutes.  Bliss.  There are few things I enjoy more than that slide into the water made soft by the salts and then my leisurely soak.  When I get out my aches and pains have been soothed away.  My skin also feels a lot softer too, but doesn&#x27;t have that filmy feeling a lot of bath products leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the salts are unscented they are the perfect product for someone either intolerant to perfumes and scents or not wanting to walk around smelling like flowers all day.  They just leave you with a fresh, clean, feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read that several of the other reviewers use the salts to make scrubs.  I had not thought of that, but now I can&#x27;t wait to try it.  Crafty project coming up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a product free of charge for the purpose of providing a review. My opinions are my own and are completely based on my experience and testing of the product.</li>
    <li> I made a great sugar scrub with these Dead Sea Bath Salt. There really isn&#x27;t a smell to them and they are a great add in. You can also just sprinkle some of the Dead Sea Bath Salts into your bath and swish it around and then soak in it for a relaxing stress relief bath and who doesn&#x27;t need those at least once a week. This bag has alot in it and will last for many baths or projects. This is a must have in my essential oil stash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for review purposes but my opinions are honest.</li>
    <li> Toxins are everywhere, including our clothing, food, the air we breathe and the household products that we use daily. Detox baths are an incredibly beneficial, easy way to try to help draw out these nasty toxins and they can work wonders for inflammation, skin issues, mood, overall health, virus recovery time and sleep quality. Please check out my blog page My Domestic Dish for full recipe ingredients for the Ultimate Detox Bath but I wanted to comment regarding the efficacy and worth of the Adovia Dead Sea Salts, a main ingredient for anyone wishing to go that route.&lt;br /&gt;Typically, for anyone over 100lbs and if you&#x27;re using standard epsom salts, you want to add 2 cups to a detox bath. Adovia Dead Sea Bath Salts have a higher mineral concentration than standard epsom salts and I find that one cup does the trick for me- a little bit goes a long way. If you google Dead Sea salts, you&#x27;ll be bombarded with a slew of benefits and I can not say enough about this addition to the weekly routine and find anything else that&#x27;s readily available to pale in comparison. They assist with skin conditions (like my poor hubby&#x27;s eczema), hypertension, replenishing the body&#x27;s magnesium level, drawing out toxins, and soothing head aches, muscle aches and joint pains. I enjoy this particular brand for my detox bath, as it contains absolutely no additives, colours or scents and includes 26 essential minerals. I read somewhere that they actually help reduce wrinkles by up to 40% and assist with forming protein in brain tissue and joints, which is an added plus to a relaxing soak.&lt;br /&gt;I loved these, consider them a good value for the money and they left my skin quite smooth.</li>
    <li> They are finely ground to dissolve quickly. There are many benefits when taking a Dead Sea Salt soak.  For me it is for my Psoriasis, but it can help those with Eczema and Arthritis. It also is great for soothing and relaxation spay style. I decided to take my bath with the salts. I used it to exfoliate before it dissolved into the water.  There are no additives , chemicals or perfumes so this is a natural product. It also has higher levels of Minrals than Epsom Salts.I don&#x27;t have arthritis but its supposed to be great for join pains, and muscle pain disorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to take my bath with the salts. I used it to exfoliate before it dissolved into the water.  There are no additives , chemicals or perfumes so this is a natural product. It also has higher levels of Minerals than Epsom Salts.I don&#x27;t have arthritis but its supposed to be great for join pains, and muscle pain disorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just toss a cup of this Dead Sea Bath Salts into your warm bath you are drawing. Soak for 20 minutes and then rinse off. You can also draw a warm bath like I did and then take the salt out and apply it directly to the skin and let it dissolve into your bath to soak . After my soak my skin didn&#x27;t itch which it normally does. It also left my skin much softer which is a huge plus. It is so nice to have this at your disposal at home rather than at a spa. You avoid both the trip and the expense with this product. It says there are over 26 essential minerals so you are definitely still getting a spa experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can try adding a few drops of lavender essential oil to your bath to give it a nice scent while still staying natural. I did receive a sample of this product in order to write this review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my skin sooo soft!</li>
    <li> I use them to take a bath before bed and I absolutely love them. It was very relaxing and my skin was super soft after. This product has also been helping with my rough spots and acne. I really liked that it dissolved quickly and didn&#x27;t make the water foggy.  I do wish that there was a fragrance to the salts to help with the relaxing process.  I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My first thought when receiving Adovia Sea Salt-  you will get your moneys worth! Almost 2 lbs!! This past week I had an extremely sore neck so it came at a great time. Not only does it relieve sore muscles, but I appreciated that it did not leave the tub gritty. I often don&#x27;t like bath salts for this reason. The Adovia Bath Salts dissolved quickly and was delightfully refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;It is also a great salt for those DIY pinterest projects, which my daughters have been all about lately.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth your money, quality and value.&lt;br /&gt;http://buckoutfamily.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> I am absolutely impressed. Recently I spent a few day in the hospital due to a herniated disc in my back, that has a slight rupture. As you can imagine the pain from this, but now think of how you guard your body and move differently to accommodate an injury of sorts. You start to then realize a ton of ache&#x27;s and pains, due to you guarding your injured body parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used about 1/4 cup, in a full steaming tub of hot water and decided to soak, for about an hour. When I came out of the tub, I realized my leg&#x27;s where not hurting and my lower back muscles were no longer screaming at me. Now prior to this I would still take hot baths and while they would help a little, I still struggled getting out of the tub due to the discomfort from the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty pleased with Adovia dead sea salts and would recommend them to anyone! The soft skin was a huge added bonus too!</li>
    <li> its makes skin instantly relaxed and its very soothing. It helped me with my arthritis pains, relieving all my pressure pains from arthritis. It completely leaves my skin incredibly soft.</li>
    <li> Adovia Dead Sea Salts are amazing! I used them when I exfoliated before shaving my legs and I got the closest shave ever! Even with my 4 month old disposable razor my legs were silky smooth for the following two days! Not only that, but they work so much better than Epson Salt! These are perfect for exfoliating, detox baths, or prepping for a spray tan! I absolutely am in love with this product! Never going back!</li>
    <li> Fast dissolving, just a great. Product!</li>
