      <li>Hard to take out the tips from the grips, and put them on sometime, and on some of the nuts on the gripper where you tighten up the tub, and tip to the gun, well the nuts can easily get striped, and then ether your tip, tub or both could not be undone, to clean the gun parts, or to switch tips out.</li>
      <li>so I was actually pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>I am currently awaiting the arrival of my package and hope that it comes complete.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised amazon.com still allows them to sale such low quality items.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Picture shows tubes grips and tips. it only comes with grips and tips no tubes to attach to the gun</li>
    <li> half of defective products, do not recommend 😡👎</li>
    <li> These are one time use! Do not try to steralize or the grip will become calcified to the tip and tube. Absolute garbage!</li>
    <li> The tips are garbage and throw ink everywhrre. I&#x27;m very dissatisfied with these products altogether. I&#x27;m surprised amazon.com still allows them to sale such low quality items. I probably see me switching to ebay because of this.</li>
    <li> they are great the perfect ones he needed also planning on ordering more stuff soon . He is looking forward on getting more and for a good price , So i thank you again</li>
    <li> Hard to take out the tips from the grips, and put them on sometime, and on some of the nuts on the gripper where you tighten up the tub, and tip to the gun, well the nuts can easily get striped, and then ether your tip, tub or both could not be undone, to clean the gun parts, or to switch tips out. but out of all the bad things about this, there&#x27;s always a lot of good things to lol. if you be very kind to them nuts lol, and try not to force your tip, in or out your tube because it will ether bend the corners or get stuck, so just ezzzz it in, with twisting motion, so if you can manage that the set is good for you.</li>
    <li> Great replacement tubes and tips the grips are all  the same size and look great, good to have extras around the shop</li>
    <li> Did not come with the tubes as described. Don&#x27;t waste your money if you need all of the parts.</li>
    <li> They work great! Showed up with everything as described in add. Well constructed. Probably will order more very soon just for extra supplies! Shipped FAST!!!!!</li>
    <li> The tips are cheap. I wasn&#x27;t happy with the box they came in. All scattered in a box with no labels for what they are. Not a great buy. But, I have been happy with most of onetattoo&#x27;s products!</li>
    <li> Thank you for my new 31 pice tattooing stuff ot was used the first day it had arived thank you</li>
    <li> These arrived on schedule which was pleasing however they are cheaply made. The tube holes are not lined up 100% correctly there for your needle must sit crocked. Also some holes are not drilled out the whole way. It was fixable and usuable. Its and okay quick fix and cheap buy. By no means its it professional quality or will be a nice long use product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this.At first my husband was disappointed, because he thought I order a set with 1 inch grips. He has change d his tune and is very happy to have this set.</li>
    <li> The tips are hard to use the , needless don&#x27;t fit correct in some</li>
    <li> Excellent products and fast delivery. Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
    <li> mala presentacion, parecen usados y defectuosas</li>
    <li> everything was excellent and brand new i recommend it to any one who wants it and we are using it with no problem</li>
    <li> Excellent merchandise</li>
    <li> Not Bad, for the money very good! (US PARTS WOULD COST TEN TIMES AS MUCH!) The machining is not perfect... the diamond tips are horrible and required a dremmel to get into shape (NOTE. I READ REVIEWS BEFORE I PURCHASED SO KNEW  ID HAVE TO DO THIS WITH SOME OF EM!).. however, only four out of the set needed this so I was actually pleasantly surprised.  The flats and rounds were good, some of the flats were from a different manufacturer and had sizes on them, the rest did not... again, I read reviews so expected this.  tubes were clear of faults and the grips (while heavy and chunky) work fine (hey, I needed to work out at gym anyway :-) .</li>
    <li> will order again when I need them</li>
    <li> Three off them will not even tighten down</li>
    <li> Very happy with the purchase of this set</li>
    <li> They get the job done.</li>
    <li> These are great I love them I use them everyday one of the best investment I&#x27;ve ever made</li>
    <li> Nope...these colored grips are ALL aluminum...don&#x27;t buy this BS. The tips I find in these lots are not stainless steel either but silver painted copper.</li>
    <li> not bad for the price. these come in handy if you&#x27;re doing more then one tattoo at a time . great deal for the price!!!!</li>
    <li> I am currently awaiting the arrival of my package and hope that it comes complete. Once the package is here I ill update the review to inform everyone on how the tips and tubes worked for me. So I am giving it a 5 star in the mean time</li>
    <li> We cant give it a review--We havent been able to use this product because it was missing 6 pieces that are needed to be able to use this product--it&#x27;s missing the 6 straight tubes (the ones with no points on them)--so it&#x27;s hard to give a review when my order was incomplete--</li>
    <li> The packaging was pretty messed up. But other than thatmy husband loves em.</li>
