      <li>TOP BRUSH:</li>
      <li>I do not regret this buy at all &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this brush set of eighteen sexy gold brushes.</li>
      <li>these are the best brushes next to MAC product brushes</li>
      <li>I received these brushes within 4 days after I ordered them &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>and I love them</li>
      <li>I love the color because ive never seen gold brushes before...</li>
      <li>Just wash them after you get them just to be safe</li>
      <li>she has many of the RC products and that is why i chose these.</li>
      <li>I am pleased by what I received.  </li>
      <li>Mehhh, they were ok.</li>
      <li>That being said, they were not terrible.</li>
      <li>so far so good!</li>
      <li>Not as good as higher end</li>
      <li>These brushes are pretty good.</li>
      <li>They are pretty good quality.</li>
      <li>I recommend it, for the price they are awesome, they are pretty soft, I wash them and they fall apart.</li>
      <li>They are soft AND dense and they feel so great on the face.</li>
      <li>blending is easy too.</li>
      <li>I think they&#x27;re great &amp; now that I see they&#x27;re back in stock, I&#x27;m ordering more</li>
      <li>my job has been easy and neat</li>
      <li>I am so happy I made the right choice with these brushes, shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>was looking for a cheap, in-between option while stocking up, and I ended up keeping these.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t feel cheap at all.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty okay for the price.</li>
      <li>My two favorite brush in this set is the large powder brush and the huge fan brush.</li>
      <li>Love how soft they are and the large fan brush is my favorite!</li>
      <li>So far I am loving my brushes.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this set.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m learning and thanks to these brushes I am able to learn with</li>
      <li>They are super soft and wash up nicely.</li>
      <li>And I don’t waste powder because it does an amazing job.&lt;br /&gt;FOUNDATION BRUSH: I will be honest.  </li>
      <li>They are very soft and are super for this price!</li>
      <li>Excellent quality, only thing was on one brush a few stray bristles were much longer but nothing a quick snip of scissors couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
      <li>Super super soft !</li>
      <li>I love the brushes some of the eyeshadow brushes with the white bristles do not apply product to the eye but</li>
      <li>They did smell when I first opened the package</li>
      <li>The gold of the handles is pretty and the brushes do what they&#x27;re supposed to--apply make up.</li>
      <li>They would look much better with back handles and gold accents in my opinion.</li>
      <li>the bristles are too flimsy to make a decent straight thin line and the aren’t cut to a perfect point.&lt;br /&gt;OTHER</li>
      <li>Excellent brushes for the price, definitely not MAC or other name brand brushes, but I would&#x27;ve paid double the price for these.</li>
      <li>the quality of both sides of this is pretty subpar, the comb is too thick to comb and separate, and the brush side is overly bristly and doesn&#x27;t have a good dense quality to</li>
      <li>I use the large fan brush for highlighting my cheeks, forehead, and décolleté.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skills are pretty basic, so I do not really know what traits define a good makeup brush kit.  </li>
      <li>I love this brushes, for the price I cant even complain for a single thing!</li>
      <li>They seem to be pretty high quality for the price and have exceeded my expectations.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Very well made.</li>
      <li>the bristles are spaced out too much on the spiral</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re very sturdy and durable...</li>
      <li>and I am really liking them.</li>
      <li>Really like the variety and the quality of this set.</li>
      <li>They look exactly like the picture &amp; contain very soft hairs.</li>
      <li>I think this is a great little bonus brush, I use this for my actual foundation (along with a larger flat top kabuki from this company&#x27;s 4-piece kabuki set-</li>
      <li>I originally wanted some Bobbi Brown brushes, after my Mary Kay ones died (Long lived, however!).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>These brushes are high quality.</li>
      <li>I just wish they had more fluffy crease brushes and blending brushes, but you can&#x27;t beat em for the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am by no means a professional make-up artist.  My skills are pretty basic, so I do not really know what traits define a good makeup brush kit.  I am pleased by what I received.  They did not smell to me.  They put makeup on my face --- so as long as they do that, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I received these brushes within 4 days after I ordered them &#x3D;) they&#x27;re very sturdy and durable...before I bought the brushes. Bunch of the reviews complained about the smell when you first get them but I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the smell at all...just like new car smell...it wasn&#x27;t bad...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Mac...these are the best brushes next to MAC product brushes&lt;br /&gt;The hairs do not come out and I&#x27;ve had this set for about 2 months now ...I wash them with dove soap and let them air dry. I love the color because ive never seen gold brushes before...I do not regret this buy at all &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I DIDN&#x27;T FIND THE NEED FOR ALL THE 18 BRUSHES.  I DIDN&#x27;T LIKE THE LARGE POWDER AND A FEW OTHERS. QUALITY IS THERE.</li>
    <li> nice brushes. Great quality for a good price.  Love how soft they are and the large fan brush is my favorite!</li>
    <li> These are so beautiful when you get them. You would think you paid well over what you actually did. I am glad I checked Instgram and heard about this company. So far I am loving my brushes. They don&#x27;t feel cheap at all. They are soft AND dense and they feel so great on the face.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, only thing was on one brush a few stray bristles were much longer but nothing a quick snip of scissors couldn&#x27;t fix. These are extremely soft yet hold and apply powder perfectly!</li>
    <li> Brushes are really soft, maybe too soft for my liking. One of the brush came out when I was cleaning it. Nice brushes but not all tht</li>
    <li> The brushes are wonderful&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re as advertise&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a beginner with makeup and I don&#x27;t know what most of the brushes are used for but I&#x27;m learning and thanks to these brushes I am able to learn with</li>
    <li> Mehhh, they were ok. I ordered the pro 12 piece and the kabuki sets as well. They were sooo much better! If I saw these in person I probably would have passed on them. That being said, they were not terrible. I did end up keeping them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are pretty good. I just wish they had more fluffy crease brushes and blending brushes, but you can&#x27;t beat em for the price. They are pretty good quality. Not as good as higher end but again, for the price, you can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
    <li> I Absolutely loved the brushes, but honestly they speak for themselves!! even my mom liked them, Buying her a set soon!!</li>
    <li> I would realistically give this set a 3.5-3.75 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I feel the plus outweigh the negatives.&lt;br /&gt;So let&#x27;s talk PLUS!  The highlights of this collection:&lt;br /&gt;LARGE AND SMALL FAN BRUSH: amazing for highlighting.  I use the small for very subtle detail highlighting above my brows, on my chin, and above my cupids bow. I use the large fan brush for highlighting my cheeks, forehead, and décolleté.&lt;br /&gt;LARGE POWDER BRUSH: this is a GREAT powder brush... its big, but not TOO big, its soft, and fluffy, and stays that way after several washes, it holds powder and disperses it evenly... I never feel like Marie Antoinette- all covered and dusty. And I don’t waste powder because it does an amazing job.&lt;br /&gt;FOUNDATION BRUSH: I will be honest.  I do not use foundation brushes for foundation... I use it for translucent powder to set my under eye concealer.  and this does a great GREAT job with that.&lt;br /&gt;FLAT TOP BRUSH: I think this is a great little bonus brush, I use this for my actual foundation (along with a larger flat top kabuki from this company&#x27;s 4-piece kabuki set- READ MY REVIEW ON THAT ONE!) in between my forehead and also to blend out concealer lines.&lt;br /&gt;ALL THE EYE SHADOW BRUSHES, THE EYEBROW BRUSH, AND THE SMALL DETAIL BRUSH: they do an amazing job doing their jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes I could DEFINITELY live without:&lt;br /&gt;BLUSH BRUSH- the head of this brush is just WAY to small and dense for a blush brush.  I will use it to contour sometimes, if my normal contour brush is dirty, but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;LASH COMB /BROW BRUSH COMBO- the quality of both sides of this is pretty subpar, the comb is too thick to comb and separate, and the brush side is overly bristly and doesn&#x27;t have a good dense quality to it.&lt;br /&gt;SPOOLIE BRUSH- is also subpar. the bristles are spaced out too much on the spiral that is has the same issue as the lash comb- it just doesn’t separate lashes well, and doesn’t brush through brows well either.&lt;br /&gt;POINTED EYELINER BRUSH- this is the most useless brush of them all.  the bristles are too flimsy to make a decent straight thin line and the aren’t cut to a perfect point.&lt;br /&gt;OTHER POINTS:&lt;br /&gt;There are NO labels on these brushes, so a lot of the descriptions of the brushes- I couldn’t tell you what they are specifically for, just what I use them for.  I could not decipher what these brushes were: Concealer Brush, Eye Shadow Blending Brush, Pointy Lip Brush, Round Blender Brush, Round Lip Brush, Thin Lip Brush, Nose High Light Brush. I&#x27;m going to use these brushes for whatever the best purpose I can find for them, but it WOULD be nice to know what brush is what.</li>
    <li> I have had these brushes since May and I am really liking them. They seem to be pretty high quality for the price and have exceeded my expectations. The brush hairs are all very even (none sticking out in random places) and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with them falling out.</li>
    <li> Really like the variety and the quality of this set. Nice set!! Will enjoy using all of them for a good while.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I made the right choice with these brushes, shipping was fast. Am a professional  MUA and since I started using these brushes my job has been easy and neat</li>
    <li> I ordered this set for my teenage daughter and she loves all the different brushes that come in the set.  She also says they are very soft and work well with her make up.  One of the brush heads was broken off the stick when we opened the package, but I just glued it back on to the stick and it has been fine.</li>
    <li> I recommend it, for the price they are awesome, they are pretty soft, I wash them and they fall apart. They do smell like paint when you get them but I wash them and they are great.</li>
    <li> Great in variety but they shed A LOT. Just be prepared for that. Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty okay for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of brushes! They did smell when I first opened the package but after I washed them the smell was completely gone! The bristles don&#x27;t fall out! I was expecting some of them to fall out but they don&#x27;t! I&#x27;ve had them for a couple months now and I am very happy with them. They are very soft and are super for this price!</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes for the price, definitely not MAC or other name brand brushes, but I would&#x27;ve paid double the price for these. The &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; is a kind of an ugly muted gold. They would look much better with back handles and gold accents in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes a lot - definitely not professional grade or anything, but for the price, an average make up wearing woman (me) will really love them. They are a little tricky to clean...</li>
    <li> I originally wanted some Bobbi Brown brushes, after my Mary Kay ones died (Long lived, however!).&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a cheap, in-between option while stocking up, and I ended up keeping these. I still use them over a year later, and they&#x27;re actually holding up really well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been eying this set for awhile and finally ordered it. I am so happy that I did. These brushes are high quality. Very well made. The price for this many brushes is unbelievable. They are super soft and wash up nicely. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this set. If you&#x27;re trying to decide...go for it. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I love these make up brushes they are awesome I use them and I love them and I will be purchasing another set of brushes very good quality.</li>
    <li> I love this brushes, for the price I cant even complain for a single thing! shipping was extremely fast and i will definetly order again in the future!</li>
    <li> I brought this product 2 months ago, and it is awesome. They have not shedded and after cleaning them several times, they still are like the day I got them. Great Brushes!</li>
    <li> I ordered two sets of brushes and I didn&#x27;t receive the complete set it was an 18 brush set and I only received 14.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup anymore but I got these brushes for my daughter&#x27;s wedding because I decided to wear a little makeup the brushes are so so soft no problems with shedding at all almost make me want to wear it again...thanks</li>
    <li> It was a birthday gift for my wife, she likes them very much, and is happy with this! she has many of the RC products and that is why i chose these.</li>
    <li> I have a few favorites and some that I don&#x27;t even use. Esp the fan brushes I was excited about it because the bristles are thick and soft but it&#x27;s out of shape the moment I open it from the box. It would be great they&#x27;ll fix it and if it comes with its own bag/ holder.</li>
    <li> This is a nice make up brush set. It&#x27;s good quality for a good price. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These brushes are pretty and have the thick fan shape I was looking for. The gold of the handles is pretty and the brushes do what they&#x27;re supposed to--apply make up. I think they&#x27;re great &amp; now that I see they&#x27;re back in stock, I&#x27;m ordering more so I can have a back-up set. Yay!</li>
    <li> I love the brushes some of the eyeshadow brushes with the white bristles do not apply product to the eye but all the rest are great!</li>
    <li> Brushes are nice. They look exactly like the picture &amp; contain very soft hairs. Minor con: doesn&#x27;t really give complete coverage</li>
    <li> These products work great for the most part. The smaller brushes do have loose hairs when applied but for the most part it does the job.</li>
    <li> so far so good! I love it! picks up the colors well and blending is easy too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this brush set of eighteen sexy gold brushes. They look and feel amazing. The brush hairs are soft and the handles are sturdy. I just wish the set came with a brush holder to display them in. My two favorite brush in this set is the large powder brush and the huge fan brush.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes ! Super super soft ! The powder brush could be more dense ! But over all great brushes ! I use them everyday ! Just wash them after you get them just to be safe :) I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with this purchase ! LOVE THEM !!</li>
