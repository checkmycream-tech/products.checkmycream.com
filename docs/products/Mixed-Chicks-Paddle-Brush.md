      <li>It is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>this brush is AWESOME.</li>
      <li>But when I do this brush is perfect for styling my hair.</li>
      <li>This brush is great!  </li>
      <li>Great brush !  </li>
      <li>Excellent detangling and curl defining brush.</li>
      <li>Great for combing out hair but bristles are already falling out after 2 months...</li>
      <li>Great brush</li>
      <li>This brush feels heavenly and leaves my hair and scalp feeling great.</li>
      <li>It worked great....</li>
      <li>I loved this paddle brush for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>Anyway, if you are looking for a good brush, give it a try -</li>
      <li>This brush feels so good on  my head/scalp.  </li>
      <li>This is a wonderful brush which appears to be gentle!!!  </li>
      <li>Great at detangling my daughters curls and when her hair is well moisturized, the comb defines her curls and gets rid of knots easily</li>
      <li>It was AMAZING.  </li>
      <li>brush is really good, and their hair looks lovely.</li>
      <li>It clears out most of the kinky curls in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>I really love this product</li>
      <li>So, it is more going to be a &amp;#34;get</li>
      <li>(she&#x27;s five now).worth every penny and more.</li>
      <li>I love this brush.</li>
      <li>Love using it to massage my scalp in a circular motion also.  </li>
      <li>you get what you pay for, it was quite pricey, thought it would have held up to more than a month, at the most, of use.</li>
      <li>The brush is good at detangling but the bristle backing always slips out of the brush frame, even when brushing gently.</li>
      <li>It will cut your styling time in half Love Love it!!!</li>
      <li>Somewhat flexible, will not pull hair out, cleans easy..</li>
      <li>All that said, this brush is good for the purpose of thoroughly brushing hair, meaning that it un-defines the curls and makes her hair poofy and frizzy-er than it normally is when the curls are intact.  </li>
      <li>This brush is fantastic for detangling my damp hair without tearing it out.</li>
      <li>but I hope its just as good on my natural curly hair</li>
      <li>I gave it five stars because of the high quality product, construction and how nice it works.</li>
      <li>she was so excited to have a brush that wasn&#x27;t torture for her to use.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the price!  </li>
      <li>Great for wet hair to develop curls.</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair which tangles up easily.  </li>
      <li>I think it is worth the price</li>
      <li>Thanks much. :-)</li>
      <li>I use nothing but Mixed Chicks products on my little girl and her hair is absolutely beautiful!  </li>
      <li>this brush is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, no more pulling and the time it takes for my daughters hair is only five minutes</li>
      <li>I love all mixed chicks products and read lots of reviews about this  brush.</li>
      <li>I love the size of the paddle,which allows me to only brush one section of my hair once.</li>
      <li>I am not really sure why they prefer it over a cheaper brush, or why it works better with their hair, but it just does (just like I dont know why the mixed chicks conditioner product line is so good, but it just is).</li>
      <li>She likes it so much she even took the brush and kept brushing her own hair for half an hour</li>
      <li>However it did make detangling much easier</li>
      <li>gets through my very curly hair to massage my scalp.  </li>
      <li>She is very tender headed and</li>
      <li>So much for the saying</li>
      <li>This is a quality hairbrush at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>Never spent that much money on a brush of my own and mine last years, been having my current over 6 yrs!</li>
      <li>but the handle broke too quickly even after gluing back together twice.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>It normally would take 10 minutes of weeping and screaming to brush her hair.  </li>
      <li>Better off with boar headbristles that help spread oils and tame that mane.</li>
      <li>Too big for my little girls to brush their own hair.</li>
      <li>the previous brush I had was a cheap one</li>
      <li>I was hesitant about this expensive brush, but since we are so happy with the conditioner products from Mixed Chicks, I though it would be worth the try (we have two mixed girls, 3 and 9, and before discovering the Mixed Chicks products, managing their hair was a nightmare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have only used it while my hair was straight</li>
      <li>but the true test is to see how long the brush will last.</li>
      <li>I use this brush only when my natural hair is straighten.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft enough for her scalp but sturdy to detangle her hair.  </li>
      <li>This brush was amazing at first to use especially with their deep conditioner, the ease of brushing and detangling my curly locks had me amazed, then after a few uses the bristles just started popping out, I am missing a few now, and while I still prefer to use this brush over others for brushing out my curls</li>
      <li>I bought it because I have loved Mixed Chics hair products before, but this was a disappointment.</li>
      <li>Exactly one month after purchase, using it on my two mixed daughters hair every other day, the teeth of the brush started to fall out in my daughters&#x27; hair and the backing started to pull out of the wooden handle.</li>
      <li>I have a lot less complaints when combing my 3 yr old&#x27;s hair using this first to clear out sections, then can use a comb or bristle brush for styling as usual.</li>

<li> My granddaughter is mixed, black and white.  </li>
<li> I have very curly/fine hair (I am half black and half white) - if that information helps.</li>
<li> I expected the brush to be as helpful as the conditioner</li>
<li> I was very sad in regards to the bristles dropping out, I still think it is worth the money and will continue to use it until I need another!</li>
<li> but I gave it less one star due to the price</li>
<li> It just so big and hard to handle.  </li>
<li> Not worth the cost.  </li>
<li> it is a MUST TRY for anyone who has a child with extremely curly hair!</li>
<li> I actually was randomly looking for leave-in conditioners and came across the Mixed Chicks line and read some reviews of this brush.  </li>
<li> what I want to use when I want her curls to remain tight and spirally.  </li>
<li> Now I have an expensive wooden pad with no brisles.</li>
<li> no more tears.  </li>
<li> If you have thick curly hair please don&#x27;t miss out on Not getting this brush</li>
<li> It works well on my medium thick hair.  </li>
<li> It has a wide base and a long handle for ease of use.  </li>
<li> and she would always complain about how painful it was whenever I brushed her hair.  </li>
<li> I like mixed chix because my hair has a lot ofracial tension thatcreates knots and rats that are painful and unsightly.</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be sorry if you order this.</li>
<li> -it is a bit on the expensive side for a hair brush.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t notice a difference in detangling my daughter&#x27;s crazy hair.  </li>
<li> Disappointed</li>
<li> The bristles are set in a rubber base, so it flexes when you brush your hair.  </li>

    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Great for wet hair to develop curls.</li>
    <li> The brush arrived containing human hairs in it.</li>
    <li> This is a quality hairbrush at a reasonable price.  It works well on my medium thick hair.  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> gets through my very curly hair to massage my scalp.  doesn&#x27;t tear my hair.  this is a keeper</li>
    <li> This brush is great!  It clears out most of the kinky curls in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I have a lot less complaints when combing my 3 yr old&#x27;s hair using this first to clear out sections, then can use a comb or bristle brush for styling as usual.</li>
    <li> this item along has taken 10 to 15 min off of combing my daughters hair it is a MUST TRY for anyone who has a child with extremely curly hair!</li>
    <li> Great for combing out hair but bristles are already falling out after 2 months... Disappointed</li>
    <li> Great brush but the handle broke too quickly even after gluing back together twice.  However it did make detangling much easier</li>

    <li> I really love this product but I gave it less one star due to the price-it is a bit on the expensive side for a hair brush.  But I must say, it is a really great brush!  It works out the tangles in my daughter&#x27;s hair and she does not complain when I use this brush on her head.  She is very tender headed and the previous brush I had was a cheap one and she would always complain about how painful it was whenever I brushed her hair.  The bristles are soft enough for her scalp but sturdy to detangle her hair.  It has a wide base and a long handle for ease of use.  I think it is worth the price but the true test is to see how long the brush will last.</li>
    <li> My daughter is caucasian, but has curly, gnarly hair.  She HATES when I brush it with any sort of brush.  I actually was randomly looking for leave-in conditioners and came across the Mixed Chicks line and read some reviews of this brush.  It is wonderful.  It normally would take 10 minutes of weeping and screaming to brush her hair.  I took the MC brush out of the package, and brushed her hair (starting with the ends) all the way through in about 1 minute.  It was AMAZING.  She likes it so much she even took the brush and kept brushing her own hair for half an hour she was so excited to have a brush that wasn&#x27;t torture for her to use.  All that said, this brush is good for the purpose of thoroughly brushing hair, meaning that it un-defines the curls and makes her hair poofy and frizzy-er than it normally is when the curls are intact.  So, it is more going to be a &amp;#34;get the knots out&amp;#34; from time to time brush, rather than what I want to use when I want her curls to remain tight and spirally.  My plan is to brush her after she washes her hair, then put in product and use my fingers to help encourage the curls.  I won&#x27;t brush after that point or this brush would pull apart the style.</li>
    <li> Bristles falling out after using several times, didnt use this on a regular basis until now. So much for the saying you get what you pay for, it was quite pricey, thought it would have held up to more than a month, at the most, of use. It is made for mixed chics hair afterall. Now I have an expensive wooden pad with no brisles. Never spent that much money on a brush of my own and mine last years, been having my current over 6 yrs!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a paddle brush to detangle curly hair before shampoo day. The brush is good at detangling but the bristle backing always slips out of the brush frame, even when brushing gently.</li>
    <li> this brush is AWESOME. I have very curly hair which tangles up easily.  I needed a brush that i could&lt;br /&gt; use in the shower &amp; then while i am blow drying my hair as well. This bruch has been awesome in both arenas. it smoothes my hair as well as detangles without pulling on my hair.</li>
    <li> I use this brush only when my natural hair is straighten. But when I do this brush is perfect for styling my hair. I love the size of the paddle,which allows me to only brush one section of my hair once.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about this expensive brush, but since we are so happy with the conditioner products from Mixed Chicks, I though it would be worth the try (we have two mixed girls, 3 and 9, and before discovering the Mixed Chicks products, managing their hair was a nightmare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is really good, and their hair looks lovely. I am not really sure why they prefer it over a cheaper brush, or why it works better with their hair, but it just does (just like I dont know why the mixed chicks conditioner product line is so good, but it just is). Anyway, if you are looking for a good brush, give it a try - the only negative is the price, but I do think it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I love all mixed chicks products and read lots of reviews about this  brush. this brush is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, no more pulling and the time it takes for my daughters hair is only five minutes now.what a time saver.wish I bought this years ago (she&#x27;s five now).worth every penny and more.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful brush which appears to be gentle!!!  Love using it to massage my scalp in a circular motion also.  Thanks much. :-)</li>
    <li> I loved this paddle brush for my daughter&#x27;s hair. It makes it easier to brush her hair since she has mixed hair with my exhusband&#x27;s hair. Her hair isn&#x27;t as mixed like my littlest daughter&#x27;s hair. I recommend this brush to any mom who&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s hair has mixed texture hair.</li>
    <li> Great brush !  Somewhat flexible, will not pull hair out, cleans easy..</li>
    <li> If you have thick curly hair please don&#x27;t miss out on Not getting this brush It will cut your styling time in half Love Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Detangles, smooths, but doesn&#x27;t break hair. I gave it five stars because of the high quality product, construction and how nice it works.</li>
    <li> This brush feels so good on  my head/scalp.  The bristles are set in a rubber base, so it flexes when you brush your hair.  It almost feels like &amp;#34;therapy&amp;#34;.  As my title says, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;wonderful brush&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price!  I use nothing but Mixed Chicks products on my little girl and her hair is absolutely beautiful!  Thank you for your products Mixed Chicks!!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never brushed your long hair with a large paddle brush, you&#x27;re missing out. I can&#x27;t even explain it but I use to think all brushes were the same. This brush feels heavenly and leaves my hair and scalp feeling great.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I have 4 biracial daughters and they all have different hair textures. This brush goes through their hair without any problems. I didn&#x27;t like the price but after using the brush the price is no longer an issue.</li>
    <li> It worked great....for a month, then it fell apart. Exactly one month after purchase, using it on my two mixed daughters hair every other day, the teeth of the brush started to fall out in my daughters&#x27; hair and the backing started to pull out of the wooden handle. And that&#x27;s with 3 different conditioners, detanglers, and oils already in the hair to make the brushing easier. I bought it because I have loved Mixed Chics hair products before, but this was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Not a fan.  I don&#x27;t notice a difference in detangling my daughter&#x27;s crazy hair.  Not worth the cost.  I&#x27;ll stick with a comb for her curls.</li>
    <li> I have only used it while my hair was straight but I hope its just as good on my natural curly hair</li>
    <li> I like mixed chix because my hair has a lot ofracial tension thatcreates knots and rats that are painful and unsightly. I expected the brush to be as helpful as the conditioner but it is simply another paddly brush. Better off with boar headbristles that help spread oils and tame that mane.</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic for detangling my damp hair without tearing it out. I have very curly/fine hair (I am half black and half white) - if that information helps.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter is mixed, black and white.  This brush is everything that it is.  It goes through my granddaughters hair like a breeze, no more tears.  I ordered a second one for her house.  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you order this.</li>
    <li> Excellent detangling and curl defining brush. Works in unison with the Mixed Chicks product line as I purchased that as well!</li>
    <li> It just so big and hard to handle.  The handle does make a difference.  Too big for my little girls to brush their own hair.</li>
