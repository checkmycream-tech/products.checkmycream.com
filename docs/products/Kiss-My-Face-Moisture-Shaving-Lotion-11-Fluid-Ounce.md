      <li>Best Men&#x27;s Shaving Lotion/cream -</li>
      <li>KMF&#x27;s shaving cream is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent shave cream.</li>
      <li>This stuff tingles and feels incredible before shaving, during, and after.</li>
      <li>Great lather with an inch on the brush.</li>
      <li>The tube is great to throw in my bag for travel.</li>
      <li>Works great for him.  </li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>A great value.</li>
      <li>This is a shaving slime your best bet is to whip it up with a brush in to a foam, it will whip up and this way it is not horrible but not a lotion.</li>
      <li>This is easily the best shaving cream for the price.</li>
      <li>No cans, no propellent, I use a brush and this stuff is good and foamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is now a toss up with Proraso that is good also.</li>
      <li>My Face has so many great products.  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not to love!</li>
      <li>is not too strong and feels great on the face.</li>
      <li>Very nice cream for a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>, it gives a great shave and the cool mint scent</li>
      <li>it is easy to apply, creates a very smooth shave and allows the blade to cut close to the skin!</li>
      <li>This leaves your face feeling incredibly smooth and I love that!</li>
      <li>Always a sure purchase.  </li>
      <li>I love this shave lotion.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite shave gels.  </li>
      <li>The cool mint feeling on your face is also very satisfying.</li>
      <li>I like the way it shaves :)&lt;</li>
      <li>The cool mint is very refreshing.</li>
      <li>As some people have compared this to Proraso, I find this does lather a bit better than it</li>
      <li>Works great, very easy, goes far.</li>
      <li>Nice foamy and cool smell.</li>
      <li>Pretty dammed good.  </li>
      <li>Great aroma.....and NATURAL!</li>
      <li>Nice minty fresh feel and odor.  </li>
      <li>I get a close shave and it easily rinses off of the razor.  </li>
      <li>This shaving cream has a great latter, and leaves your skin smooth.  </li>
      <li>Cannot say enough great things about it...</li>
      <li>Seems to last a while and is a great price.</li>
      <li>and I found I needed to use a lot for a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>Good stuff to use with an old fashioned razor.</li>
      <li>My face is very sensitive and KMF does everything I need it to do and more!</li>
      <li>skin feels super smooth.</li>
      <li>And whenever a soap doesn&#x27;t want to lather for my brush a quick squirt of KMF solves the problem.</li>
      <li>I bought the smaller size to see if I liked it, but the bigger pump bottles look like good value</li>
      <li>fragrance and &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; is much milder than Proraso, so if you are put off by strong tingly shaving creams this will solve your problem.  </li>
      <li>I wish it were available more locally.</li>
      <li>My favorite shave creme for traveling especially, but use it at home too.  </li>
      <li>This cream actually gives a better lather than Proraso.  </li>
      <li>and it comes in many different fragrances.  </li>
      <li>Smooth oily shave only takes a little to get a good lather</li>
      <li>I know it sounds like a cheap commercial tag line, but it really does!</li>
      <li>The foaming thing is a gimmick anyways, you don&#x27;t really need it.  </li>
      <li>Really makes a difference for my skin.  </li>
      <li>My husband really likes this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Smell is not overwhelming, Nice.</li>
      <li>There are better for less.</li>
      <li>Not to mention the low price for such outstanding product.</li>
      <li>Now although I love this for the price I would  have this as a backup shaving cream in my travel or gym bag to one that is a little bit slicker.</li>
      <li>I normally use Proraso shave cream.  </li>
      <li>At first sight I was skeptical but the results are amazing.</li>
      <li>I prefer the cool mint flavor but the other ones work just as well.</li>
      <li>All natural ingredients is just the icing on the cake.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft and supple afterwards.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>I have had more expensive shaving creams/lotions/gel, yet for a small price this outdid most of them!</li>
      <li>When I say better, I mean that it seems to lather up thicker and go on smoother.  </li>
      <li>Honestly this shaving cream surpasses any other shaving cream I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not slick enough on your face and give a scrapy shave.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;foam up\\&quot; when you apply it, but that is because it&#x27;s a natural product, without the chemicals in the traditional brands.  </li>
      <li>This does mean that you will have to take extra care to thoroughly rinse your razor between passes, since it will not rinse as easily as Proraso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> You only need a small drop or two and the stuff lasts so long.</li>
<li> I instantly disliked this product as a facial shave product.  </li>
<li> This is creamy and a little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> simple approach is to put a small dab in my palm and then swirl the damp brush in my hand to make foam.  </li>
<li> The mint leaves a cooling sensation but if you don&#x27;t like this there are a lot of other scents.</li>
<li> Its nothing like your typical foam or gel shaving cream that you see other companies making.</li>
<li> -- it doesn&#x27;t foam, but a small amount goes a long way and it rinses well too.</li>
<li> This has a very little mint aroma that won&#x27;t offend anyone.</li>
<li> If you are looking for shaving lotion get a different product I use Beard Lube and it is WICKED expensive</li>
<li> I figured even if it was terrible I would have only wasted a few bucks.  </li>
<li> I was getting tired of having to throw out the non-recyclable aerosol shaving cream bottles, so was looking for something else to try.</li>
<li> It lathers poorly if you put it in a shaving cup and churn it with your brush.  </li>
<li> I never cared for foam (either too thick or totally lame) or gel (too slippery and thin cover).  </li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>

    <li> Nice foamy and cool smell. I like the way it shaves :)&lt;br /&gt;It lessens ur irritations and gives u closer shave</li>
    <li> My favorite shave creme for traveling especially, but use it at home too.

    <li> The composition of the soap sometimes gunks up my safety razor to the point where I have to take it apart and carefully wipe the gummy soap off the blade and internal surfaces of the razor.  It doesn&#x27;t happen all the time, so maybe it is just me not working it properly with my brush.  Other than that, it gives a great shave and the cool mint scent is not too strong and feels great on the face.</li>
    <li> This is easily the best shaving cream for the price. It leaves your skin feeling soft and supple afterwards. I know it sounds like a cheap commercial tag line, but it really does!</li>
    <li> I love this shave lotion.  I never cared for foam (either too thick or totally lame) or gel (too slippery and thin cover).  This is creamy and a little goes a long way.  I get a close shave and it easily rinses off of the razor.  All natural ingredients is just the icing on the cake.</li>
    <li> I instantly disliked this product as a facial shave product.  It&#x27;s like rubbing toothepaste on your face.  It lathers poorly if you put it in a shaving cup and churn it with your brush.  It&#x27;s not slick enough on your face and give a scrapy shave.  Smells like toothepaste also.  This product might work well for women to shave their legs, etc., but as a facial shave cream it bombs.  I gave it a try, out of curiosity, but would never repurchase it.</li>
    <li> No complaints.  Does it&#x27;s job.  Nice minty fresh feel and odor.  Though I prefer Proraso, I don&#x27;t mind using KMF too!</li>
    <li> I normally use Proraso shave cream.  I decided to purchase this product because it was cheaper on a per-ounce basis than Proraso.  I figured even if it was terrible I would have only wasted a few bucks.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This cream actually gives a better lather than Proraso.  When I say better, I mean that it seems to lather up thicker and go on smoother.  This does mean that you will have to take extra care to thoroughly rinse your razor between passes, since it will not rinse as easily as Proraso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance and &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; is much milder than Proraso, so if you are put off by strong tingly shaving creams this will solve your problem.  I will probably keep buying this cream, along with Proraso, and running them in tandem.  Sometimes you just want extra burn in the morning to wake you up!</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this stuff.  Works great for him.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have any of the junk in it.  Seems to last a while and is a great price.</li>
    <li> Good stuff to use with an old fashioned razor. You only need a small drop or two and the stuff lasts so long. Works well.</li>
    <li> Smooth oily shave only takes a little to get a good lather&lt;br /&gt;Razor just guides along your fae&lt;br /&gt;Kiss m face</li>
    <li> This stuff tingles and feels incredible before shaving, during, and after. Cannot say enough great things about it...</li>
    <li> This is not a lotion I bought it because it is called shaving lotion. If you are looking for shaving lotion get a different product I use Beard Lube and it is WICKED expensive so I wanted to try this well you get what you pay for. This is a shaving slime your best bet is to whip it up with a brush in to a foam, it will whip up and this way it is not horrible but not a lotion.</li>
    <li> Closest shave, no nicks, smoothest skin and I tried them all over the last 40 years.</li>
    <li> Great lather with an inch on the brush. Enough for 3 passes. Smell is not overwhelming, Nice. Shave was non pulling and skin feels super smooth. This is now a toss up with Proraso that is good also. I am just going to use both of them.</li>
    <li> I rotate through about 3-5 different shaving creams and I like to keep a mint one in rotation. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. As some people have compared this to Proraso, I find this does lather a bit better than it</li>
    <li> This shaving cream has a great latter, and leaves your skin smooth.  The mint makes your skin feel refreshed.  This one is in my regular rotation.  This has a very little mint aroma that won&#x27;t offend anyone.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this for his morning shave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll always have some Kiss My Face soap on hand. The tube is great to throw in my bag for travel. And whenever a soap doesn&#x27;t want to lather for my brush a quick squirt of KMF solves the problem. What&#x27;s not to love!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite shave gels.  I like this a lot and it comes in many different fragrances.  I&#x27;m going to try the others as well.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shave cream. The cool mint is very refreshing. A great value. I wish it were available more locally.</li>
    <li> Always a sure purchase.  Kiss My Face has so many great products.  This is one of my favorites in all sizes.  This one can &amp;#34;fly&amp;#34;.  Silky.  Great aroma.....and NATURAL!</li>
    <li> Honestly this shaving cream surpasses any other shaving cream I&#x27;ve used in the past. Its nothing like your typical foam or gel shaving cream that you see other companies making. This leaves your face feeling incredibly smooth and I love that! The cool mint feeling on your face is also very satisfying. At first sight I was skeptical but the results are amazing.

    <li> KMF&#x27;s shaving cream is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;foam up\\&quot; when you apply it, but that is because it&#x27;s a natural product, without the chemicals in the traditional brands.  The foaming thing is a gimmick anyways, you don&#x27;t really need it.  I prefer the cool mint flavor but the other ones work just as well.</li>
    <li> I was getting tired of having to throw out the non-recyclable aerosol shaving cream bottles, so was looking for something else to try. I tried the EOS brand, but it didn&#x27;t foam at all and I found I needed to use a lot for a smooth shave. I think I&#x27;m going to stick with this brand -- it doesn&#x27;t foam, but a small amount goes a long way and it rinses well too. The mint leaves a cooling sensation but if you don&#x27;t like this there are a lot of other scents. I bought the smaller size to see if I liked it, but the bigger pump bottles look like good value and I&#x27;m going to upsize when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Really makes a difference for my skin.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Pretty dammed good.  Id dry shave in the shower then after the shower reshave with it...smoothe as silk baby.</li>
