<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the cologne but it was defective that I can&#x27;t spray it and wanted to call and return it. Didn&#x27;t notice it when I got it until November 1st when I wanted to use it before l realize it was defective.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne in 2008 and have used it maybe 2 times.  Not really impressed.  It&#x27;s definitely not one of my favorites...not a must have!!</li>
    <li> Love this, first time I heard of it, bought the four pack, smells great &amp; love the unique packaging.Great for gifts.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of different colognes and am pretty darn picky.  I like having a variety and somebody recommended this to me and I was a little skeptical at first but as soon as I tried it I knew I had an instant new favorite.  It is very unique and I get tons of compliments when I wear it.  I really like this and will be sure to have a couple bottles on hand just in case I can&#x27;t find it when this bottle runs out!</li>
    <li> Well, this cologne is cheap and you cannot go wrong with such cheap cologne. But this cologne is not usable. It has weird floral like scent and definitely as a guy I didn&#x27;t like it. Moreover the scent is so strong that everyone around would notice the scent. So, for me there is no use of it. At the end of the day you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, the package..very pleased....the fragance is I do not know hou to say in english, but in spanish it &#x27;s \\&quot;Dulce\\&quot;....I do not personally like this kind of fragance but my father does, so I bought it.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have bought a bottle this big and it was well worth it.  Great price, paid what I typically pay for a smaller bottle at a local perfume/cologne store. Smells great, have loved it for a while and now I don&#x27;t have to buy more for my husband in a month!</li>
    <li> Husband loves this and it is much cheaper here than in a perfume store.  It seems to be as strong and long lasting as from the store, so I think it is not a knock off.</li>
    <li> excelente fragancia por el precio que pagas.. empieza como JPG y termina como el Black Jeans de Versace, es un poco empalagosa para oficina pero para clubs o al aire libre funciona bien.  Si te gusta el Jean Paul Gaultier pero se te hace muy \\&quot;ofensivo\\&quot; en cuanto aroma y costo, esta es la mejor opcion...mejor que el 360 White de Perry Ellis.    durabilidad....6 hrs y con buen \\&quot;sillage\\&quot; pero lo considero mas de \\&quot;flor de piel\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is really good. Three times bigger than what I was expecting. Good price.</li>
    <li> Thought I would try this as the price was right at the time ... pleasantly surprised and it has become one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I ordered, very competitive price, and arrived quicker than expected. will be ordering from them again as soon as the colonge is gone.</li>
    <li> Giving my bottle away tomorrow. I tried to like this stuff but it is to sweet smelling. Also there is an odor in it that flat out just makes me ill. It smells good on someone else but I cant wear this stuff. Very cloying.  If you(a Man) like to smell like sweet vanilla this stuff is for you.Buy the cuba red(I have) ALOT more manly smelling...spicy good  sent.</li>
    <li> This was excellent value for money.  Always bought Cuba for my men, but never found it this price ever.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my husband as part of his Valentines gift.  I was worried because strong odors give me an instant migrane, but this smell is wonderful.  It is somewhat sweet with a spicy smell as well.  A bay rum type cologne, but not as harsh.  It is very appealing to smell, actually.  A few squirts and the smell lasts all day long.  I have to say that I am very impressed and my husband just asked me to get more so he doesn&#x27;t run out of it!</li>
    <li> The scent is an offshoot of the popular, main line scents (crisp and clean) that are out there.  It is definitely different and reminds me in some ways of an Old Spice type scent.  Different and unique.  It has a musty smell to it and I can definitely see why it is branded around the \\&quot;cigar\\&quot;.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that it is an overpowering scent either, so you can wear it safely without wondering if you are fumugating or poisoning your entire air space. For a few bucks, it was worth a try especially if you are looking for something adventurous and different.</li>
    <li> This stuff smell great. It doesn&#x27;t last ALL day, but it is still noticeable by lunch. I first recieved one that smell like watered down alcohol, but the customer service sent me a good bottle post haste.</li>
    <li> Great smell&lt;br /&gt;Accurate shipping</li>
    <li> For the price, this has got to be the best cologne in the world. From the smell, you would never guess how cheap this is. It smells modern and fresh. It is very much in the style of Jean Paul Gaultier le Male. For some people, that is a bit too feminine and overpowering, but JPG is the most popular fragrance in Europe. In any case, I don&#x27;t think the questions about this fragrance are really a concern about quality. It does not smell cheap by any means. The concerns are more about style -- this is not a conventional American fragrance.  By the way, I have three of the Cuba sampler packs (12 fragrances in all), and this is by far the highest quality of the bunch. Red is late &#x27;80s good. Blue is early 90&#x27;s good. Orange is inoffensive citrus. Go for the gold.</li>
    <li> Good for a small night out. Maybe use this for a nice dinner out with family or, maybe going to the movies, nothing really that special. Smell reminds me of baby powder or Joop!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;- Clean smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Longevity issues (3 hrs on my skin)&lt;br /&gt;- projection is decent for the first 30 minutes</li>
    <li> this perfume is very good, smell very very great i like it a lot! and the price is very good, is an excellent perfume.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, I love it...</li>
    <li> This is a great perfume. I am a woman and I use it for myself. It has a very spicy-vanilla note that smells clean and fresh all day.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a cheap perfume at this price but the perfume is pleasant and not too strong. It lasts an entire workday. I highly recommend this for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I am a regular user of Cuba Gold. I like it mostly because of its unique smell. A masculine wooden scent. It stays long on your skin and, although it produces a strong smell, it does not bother other people. Well, they may become jealous of your smell. Very positive ratio Cost X Benefit. I deeply recommend it. The wooden scent is very original and plesant.</li>
    <li> I have bought all the expensive colognes over the years. When I first smelled the Cuba line I was sold. My girl says the Cuba Gold is the best she has ever smelled.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend. I could eat him up when he wears it! I love that it&#x27;s sweet smelling like a spicy vanilla but still very masculine. I let my mom smell it and she said she&#x27;ll probably order some for my dad. Will definitely make sure my bf never runs out of this stuff. He loves it!</li>
    <li> Compre esta fragancia para mi novio, le encantó y a mi también, es un aroma varonil, sin ser exagerado, su olor dura todo el día,la recomiendo, es una buena fragancia a bajo costo.</li>
    <li> very nice,neat,and very good price, i would recommend for anyone who is looking for good gift with a good price</li>
    <li> My 40 year old son and my husband love this cologne! We can&#x27;t buy it locally, so we are happy that it can be ordered on-line.  Compliments are many when people \\&quot;smell\\&quot; these men.</li>
    <li> I smelled this on a friend of mine and had to buy some for my man! This was a great price and came in a cool container for gift giving. I love it!</li>
    <li> Its cheap like 12 bucks but smells good ,i have bought some expensive colognes and i get more compliments on this one.</li>
    <li> This is Too sweet smelling. Better suited as womens perfume than cologne. It gave me a headache.Sorry, Can&#x27;t reccomend it.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the scent and the price was one heck of a deal on this item! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 items but received only one. Its really annoying!</li>
    <li> This is worth the money. Nice fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend asked for this. I bought one for him and one for me..</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas and he really likes the scent -- as do I -- it&#x27;s wonderfullly romantic! This sensual scent belies its small price tag. It is very affordable and a real pleasure as the scent lingers.  Any lady out there looking for  &amp;#34;Scentsual Adventure&amp;#34; would be well advised to get her husband this cologne!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells more expensive that the price suggest. Great smell for little $. Smells similar to Le Male.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne, the smell is unique.</li>
    <li> Cuba Gold by Cuba, 3.30 Ounce ----The everyday smell good for any occasion. One of my favorites to use and last</li>
    <li> My brother and father get all sorts of compliments when wearing this cologne.  It smells amazing, and I always buy it for them as a gift for holidays, or sometimes they bug me during the year to get them more if they&#x27;re running short.  I highly recommend this to any man looking for a reasonably priced and high quality cologne.</li>
    <li> Smells identical to Jean Paul Gautier (an amazing scent), but at a fraction of the cost...and then coupled with lighting fast service?!!!... oh yeah, I will be back for more...much more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this before so i know how is smeels - which i like - great price is what i liked best</li>
    <li> I made my first purchase of this cologne over 5yrs ago and I have always loved the way this cologne smells on my husband.  Each person has a body chemistry that will blend differently with any cologne and this smells AWESOME on my husband, so much so, that my mother compliments him!!!  I love the sweet, woodsy, warmth smell that makes you just want to cuddle up next to him and relax.</li>
    <li> One of the best smelling colognes for men today a must get for your everyday wear. Will surely buy again.</li>
    <li> the product arrived safely&lt;br /&gt;excellent quality&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much</li>
    <li> At first this is a little to strong for my liking but if you throw it on twenty minutes before you go out or get dressed you&#x27;ll love the scent. It really is a distinct scent in my opinion and isn&#x27;t overwhelming as time passes. The scent also lasts all day long. Great product that I plan to purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Really nice scent...It does smell like One Million but I haven&#x27;t worn both enough to tell how much. My son wore one million last weekend and I thought one million smelled better and more unique.  Still a nice smelling cologne for $9.00</li>
    <li> The first time my son smelled this scent he was hooked.  I bought two bottles so he&#x27;ll have it for a while. The scent is long lasting and not over powering.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and spells terrific!!!!!!! Buy it today!!!</li>
    <li> Best fit for middle aged male.</li>
    <li> My favorite Cologne I have had. And My girlfriend loved it.... Alot.</li>
    <li> this came really fast, s&amp;h was free and the price of the item was good.&lt;br /&gt;the item itself is really nice, great smelling and the packaging is attractive. first time for me buying cuba products. this is a valentine&#x27;s gift and i think it will be great.</li>
    <li> Value for your money.</li>
    <li> Smells like a Latino guy but with out the stink. I Would recommend this to any one with a nose</li>
    <li> I just happen to like this cologne very much it&#x27;s a very smooth cologne and the scent is just great I get a lot of complaments about it. And your price is right on!!And my Wife and Family and friends just Love it I highly recommend it to all my friends ty for your service!!</li>
    <li> The title pretty much says it all. Don;t know any other way to describe this then to say it seems as though it was designed to cause a headache. The scent is beyond horrible. The only saving grace is that it wears off quickly. Gave it two stars for fast shipping and good packing, but the cologne itself...</li>
    <li> I bought this and Cuba red for my dad we like it more for him but he also uses this one.&lt;br /&gt;Still would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, good product</li>
    <li> When I tried it on it smelled great.  A little sweet and a touch of tobacco.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I got my first Cuba Gold at the State Fair here in Louisiana  it very expensive  but  then i see it on Amazon.com  man did i save some money plus Free Super Saver Shipping... what a deal... now i know where to buy&lt;br /&gt;more.... im being totally serious  i really don&#x27;t know what i&#x27;d do without  Amazon.com and their fast friendly&lt;br /&gt;service..  i&#x27;ve never had any trouble with fast delivery and  i buy EVERYTHING  here ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuba comes in serval fragrances ... go ahead try all of them ...  you wont regret it.  i promise...</li>
    <li> Excellent 100% Recommended</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong and the women like the smell. My go to sprays are Cuba Gold and Burberry Brit.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this scent!  its smells sooooooooooooo good!</li>
    <li> Love this ...  Great Price for a scent that last all day</li>
    <li> What a great scent. I wouldn&#x27;t have looked at this but it was given as a gift for the purchase of an expensive perfume for my wife. It&#x27;s such a great scent that I&#x27;ve now purchased it for the 3rd time since the original full sized sample. The price is fantastic too. I recommend it. You can&#x27;t go wrong for under 10 bucks.</li>
    <li> excellent product, thanks</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my boyfriend&#x27;s job&#x27;s secret santa exchange, but I smelled it when it arrived and decided that he should keep it, and we&#x27;d get him something else for the exchange. It smells LOVELY. A mix between JP Gaultier and Joop. Just a hot-sexy-clean smell.</li>
    <li> This one was a pleasant surprise.  It has a nice old world smell.  At times I mix it with another cologne and people ask me what it is I am wearing.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim a few months back and have been very pleased.  It has hints of vanilla and lavender, fairly subtle yet still noticeable.  Best feature is a pleasant smell that you would have douse yourself in before it would be considered offensive to others--it isn&#x27;t overpowering at all--but people will get a hint of as you walk by.&lt;br /&gt;I use this as an everyday cologne, opting for stronger scents for more formal occasions (dolce &amp; gabbana \\&quot;the one\\&quot; usually).&lt;br /&gt;At this price you really can&#x27;t go wrong, and is definitively worth a try.  One caveat: the bottle looks like a dildo, so choose how you display wisely.</li>
    <li> This has got to be my new favorite. A wonderful fall scent. To me, its as if you mixed a little Joop, with a little PI by Givenchy. A very warm inviting scent, a little goes a long way, and stays for a while. I wouldnt wear it to the club, but a nice outing with some friends or dinner with someone special, makes for a great atmosphere..And for the price, at 3 ounces, who can beat that...........</li>
    <li> Nice smell, it reminds me of Joop! but a little sweeter. I got this for work so I don&#x27;t need to use expensive cologne, it lasts about 4 hours so you may need to respray, but for $10 not bad.</li>
    <li> Este é um exemplo de um produto bom e barato. Pelo preço você não dá nada, mais é muito bom.</li>
    <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
    <li> Smells great!! Packaged nicely. Boyfriend loves this cologne. Does not smell cheap and last for a good solid 7-8 hours after he applies it.</li>
    <li> Heavy notes of cheap talcum powder. Stifling. Some hints of vanilla, but the powder overwhelms it. If you want a classic scent in the vanilla/powder range, try Canoe by Dana. It is not very expensive and it is miles better than Cuba Gold.</li>
    <li> Smells great and last good.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance at at an amazing value. Smells similar to Le Male By Jean Paul Gaultier.</li>
    <li> The Fragrance is great and the price amazing! I bought a sample in Miami when I was visiting and paid $10 for the sample, which I thought it was well worth it. Then I saw this one in Amazon which is three times as big and bought it quick! The shipping was fair of course sooner than what they promised and the packaging to was great. It smells musky but in a very good way. I can almost say that it smells cuban.</li>
    <li> great order, exactly as expected</li>
    <li> I started off with Le Male, then I read about this being similar for a fraction of the price. I found some locally and gave it a try. It&#x27;s amazing. I think it actually smells better than the le male. A little less sweet and a little richer. Both are great colognes but I can see myself wearing the cuban gold a lot more often.</li>
    <li> This scent smells great and lasts a good little while. My man loves it and so do I. I think you will enjoy it also</li>
    <li> My wife got this one for me a while back . . . . And I must say I was not disappointed ,,  love it and I get good comps on it....</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this smell! I bought this because I normally use Old Spice Swagger but it&#x27;s getting way to expensive for how little is in the bottle, and it started to smell more like alcohol than anything. I bought this after I read all the reviews and I the scent is just amazing. I t reminds me of an old smokey bar with drinks and fun all around.</li>
    <li> I could wear it but it is not that great, maybe I am more modern but this cologne have this old school type, maybe I could have use it back in 2000, or 2005, but right now just don&#x27;t seem so great, I experienced comments such as smells great, or just blah, that&#x27;s why the 3 stars, maybe you have friends would will love it, or you are used to this cologne, but for someone who use it for the first time, it is not for me. I hope it does help to know this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend, he loves it is very masculine without being too strong, I have to say this has turn in my go to, gift</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance, fell in love with it years ago, and am glad it is still available. Love the packaging, will order again when i run out.</li>
    <li> It smells very much like Jean Paul Gaultier&#x27;s Le Male...this one&#x27;s definitely a cheaper alternative to it. I wore this to Salsa dancing the other night and got complimented. You just cannot go wrong with the price. It was a blind buy for me...a good one too! :)</li>
    <li> I don not have much to say, you just have to smell it. It lasts for a long time too.</li>
    <li> I had one of these colognes in the cigar size bottles from some years back. Figured I would try this one. Satisified with the scent and it being real cologne and not watered down spritzers.</li>
    <li> excelent product and good price!!!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this fragrance based on the positive reviews but it was a huge disappointment to me. It&#x27;s possible I got a bad bottle. I sprayed it on the wrist and immediately it smelled like stinky, musky, sweaty clothes after working out. There&#x27;s also a powdery smell to it along with a hint of cardboard. The positive reviews says Cuba Gold smells like Le Male. I&#x27;ve never owned Le Male but to me, Cuba Gold smells like Le Ass. I own another Cuba fragrance that smells good and although Cuba Gold was $10, it&#x27;s $10 that could have went into a better Cuba fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best smelling cologne i have ever smelled, and it&#x27;s cheap... try it! i get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> When one receives so many compliments for this fragrance, you tend to stop defending the price and just go with the flow...</li>
    <li> best cologne ever. The only one I like. Everybody loves the scent. No other perfume can match the Cuba gold. Don&#x27;t care how much other perfumes cost, will not buy other perfume than the Cuba gold.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a year ago and loved it, so I thought I would give it a go again. Definitely a great decision. The smell is great, the price is great for the amount, and I always receive several compliments. Going to have to start buying this cologne more than once a year.</li>
    <li> can really get  used  to this fragrance if ur new to it .. depending on ur  body chemistry  the scent is muky and sweet .. the girls seem to like it on  me ....</li>
    <li> It is a good product. Good quality. And for people who need it, I recommend it 100%. In addition, this a good price.</li>
    <li> excellent. very well packed</li>
    <li> my husband is from cuba  he loves it &amp; i love it on him</li>
