<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> In nearly 20 years of shaving, it never even occurred to me that shaving cream was the sort of thing where quality mattered. I mean, it&#x27;s just soap that you put on your face, right? I was given this as a gift, and ended up using it when I ran out of my supply of the usual supermarket stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is amazing, if you&#x27;re even thinking about trying it do. It completely changes the shaving experience, making shaving incredibly easier, faster, and more enjoyable. Also, my face is still tingling 10 minutes after the shave.</li>
    <li> Like the old commercial says: a little dab wil do ya&#x27;  Nicely smooth and concentrated shave cream.  No nicks.  Tube is compact and easy to store or pack.</li>
    <li> I have recently been diagnosed with bi-lateral pulmonary embolus (blood clot in the lungs) and I am no longer able to use a bladed razor because I am taking blood thinners. I now have to use an electric foil type razor for my daily shaving needs. I&#x27;ve read lots of reviews on different products and this one kept coming up with great reviews so I took a chance and ordered it.     I use a Braun 370cc foil razor and it shaves as close as a blade but with this Proraso it shaves even closer not to mention my wife \\&quot;LOVES\\&quot; the smell of this stuff! It makes shaving with the electric razor so much more comfortable and smooth and leaves a light clean fresh scent! It only takes a very small amount to lather up. I wash my face with hot water and use a dime size bit on my hand and lather it up and apply to the face and then take another small dab and apply it directly to the foils on my Braun razor and rub it in then just swipe it under the hot running water and it starts foaming on the razor. The rest is history as they say!    I highly recommend this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great price on a great product. I converted to cream and brush two years ago and I am really happy that I did. Either this name brand of cream or the Proraso (same product) are superb for a close, smooth shave. BTW, I leave the brush loaded after spreading the cream on my face, then I shave once down my face and neck, then place more cream on and shave against the grain. My shaves now last two days. Shaving bumps are gone!</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing.  I just bought a tube at B&amp;BW, used it this morning with pre-shave oil and a Parker DE razor with a Shark Blade, and am astonished at how smooth, comfortable and nick-free my shave is.  It lathers up quickly, thickly and goes on smoothly.  I have a very tender neck and I never shave against the grain, so when I felt how close my shave was in a single pass, I knew I had a winner out of the box.  Heck, I might even try it next shave to see if this stuff is that good.  I love the cooling feeling that is left behind after rinsing.  I was using C&amp;E Nomad shave soap in a bowl and, while nice, it is pricey compared to this product, does not lather as richly and does not have that brisk menthol/eucalyptus feel after I rinse.  I am a C.O. Bigelow/Proraso customer for life now. BTW...use a pre-shave oil before applying this and you will be AMAZED!!!  I use ShaveSecret from Wal-Mart ($3 a bottle and it lasts ages) and the razor burn is gone for good.  This shaving cream is the best $10 you&#x27;ll ever spend, trust me.</li>
    <li> Italians have a way of making all of life&#x27;s details pleasurable, and that includes shaving.  Pro Raso&#x27;s shaving products all have the inimitable Italian \\&quot;menthe\\&quot;--eucalyptus--which makes the skin tingle and smells great.  The pre-shave readies the skin and the Bigelow crema makes the razor glide with plenty of menthe and oils. Va benissime!</li>
    <li> I recently transitioned to the classic way of shaving with a brush and double edge razor and purchased several creams to try.  This is by far my top performer so far.  In generates very nice lather, while using a minimal amount.  I use a dime size amount in the palm of my hand lather it up with a brush and slap it on.  It creates a nice slick layer on the skin and keeps nicks to a minimum.  It does seem to dry fast although that probably has more to do with me living in Arizona than it does the cream.  I will definitely buy again.  BTW I&#x27;m using it with Derby Extra blades and a Edwin Jagger DE89 razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked its all I will ever use now. Smooth shave and easy on the skin.</li>
    <li> Freshnesssssss velvet goodness</li>
    <li> Everyone says this and Proraso are the exact same thing, but they are not, this cream tends to dry really fast on your face once you put it on but the Proraso one doesn&#x27;t. Good product but i&#x27;d stick with Proraso for now.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream. I get three passes using just a pea size drop cream on my brush. Nice fresh scent,feels really nice. Good close shave.</li>
    <li> The product goes along way, with great lather and a smooth shave.  An almond size dab and a good brush will get you through several passes with comfort and nice after shave feel.</li>
    <li> First time using... Great product. Great price. A little goes along way.  Have used more expensive creams from Keihls, which I love but they are more expensive.  I do love to use Kiehl&#x27;s but needed something more economical, so I tried this and I am very pleased.  Will probably use again. Also purchased a brush for the first time and it is also great to closer shaving. I guess my next new thing will be trying to use a straight edge razor.  We&#x27;ll have to see about that tho?  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My son. who is in the Army, made a point of calling me from the base the first time he used this, just to tell me how awesome he thought it was. And he&#x27;s NEVER impressed with much of anything....so this cream must be GOLD!!!</li>
    <li> My wife bought me some of this from B&amp;BW. I would not have spent that much on a shave product. I did not think it would last that long for 5.2 oz at $10 a pop and it didn&#x27;t. However I found I really liked the stuff. The smell is intoxicating. So I had her get me more and a purchase a good shave brush. Big difference. Just need to use a little dab on the end of the wet shave brush and work it into your face. Lathers up much better and a tube should last at least as long as a can of shave cream if not longer. Try out a small tube and see what you think but if you like it I would spend money on a good shave brush to go along with it and you will have an even better experience.</li>
    <li> I had a difficult time giving this product a three star rating.  Everyone I&#x27;ve ever heard talk about just raved about it, so I assumed I would like it too.  So here&#x27;s the review:    This product does indeed whip up a really nice rich lather, and does so very quickly compared to other soaps and creams I&#x27;ve used.  The lather provides really exceptional lubrication, and my shave was close and smooth while using this product.    The scent was nothing special.  It smelled very similar to the cream that my local barber shop uses - just sort of like soap or powder or something. The menthol was also fairly prominent in the scent, which was the main problem I had with the cream.  The product is so heavily mentholated that it was almost unbearable. The effect was like vick&#x27;s vapo-rub; the menthol got into my nose, lungs, and eyes.  By the time my third pass was finished, my eyes started to feel so cold that I felt like I had to shut them to prevent more of the menthol vapors from getting in.     The cooling effect on the face was more tolerable, but still fairly strong. By the end of the third pass I was ready to wash the stuff off my face because it had started to move from a cooling to more of a stinging.  I think that I may appreciate the cooling effect on my face in the warmer months, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever like inhaling the menthol fumes.    So, the bottom line is this:  If you really like menthol, you&#x27;ll love this product.  If you mildly dislike menthol, I would still suggest that you try it (since it has almost legendary status within the wet shaving community), but I would also suggest that you have another soap or cream on hand.  If you really dislike menthol, I&#x27;d recommend staying away from this product unless you have really sensitive skin (the lather is really outstanding as far as providing a smooth shave).        *EDIT*    So, after a few weeks of using it this cream has really grown on me.  I&#x27;ve actually gotten quite used to the menthol in the product, tothe point that it doesn&#x27;t bother me any more.  At first I wasn&#x27;t willing to accept the menthol even though the lather from this cream was *exceptional* (I mean, really exceptional. It&#x27;s awesome.).  But after giving it another chance, I&#x27;ve come to love it. I now associate the menthol with a super slick shave rather than vick&#x27;s vapo-rub.     I&#x27;ve changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars.  If it weren&#x27;t for the problem with the menthol I had in the beginning, I would have given it five stars.</li>
    <li> Great Shave.  I love this stuff, really makes my face feel better when shaving.  It is easy to use and a little goes a long way. Would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I shaved just prior to receiving the box, a day earlier than anticipated. The tube is larger than I expected, which is good. Has a great smell. I haven&#x27;t seen one of these foil/metal type tubes in many years. Not sure if the tube will hold up as long as the large amount will last.    Update...Just tried the product today, it is excellent. Put a very small amount in my mixing bowl and it made great lather. This lathers just as good as the Art of Shaving shaving cream, but is half the price.</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell, this is Proraso.  Saved me about 2 bucks per tube.  And the package is more British, if you&#x27;re into that kind of thing.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is amazing, it really reduces irritation, and my face actually feels better after shaving than it did before.  I use the tweezerman badger hair brush from amazon to lather up and apply, it usually takes about 30 seconds of agitation to produce a usable lather.  I now reccomend this to any of my friends interested in trying wet shaving.</li>
    <li> This shave cream has such a cooling effect that when using cold water after shaving, it almost hurts from being too cold! I love it! You can feel the cooling effect during shaving also. Splash some cold water on after &amp; it&#x27;s like ice.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moO3QC220S38X2]]The C.O Bigelow Shave Cream is a superior product that produces a great lather and a bracing feeling on the skin because of the menthol and eucalyptus. Made by Proraso, the C.O. Bigelow shave cream seems to be, if not identical to the Proraso, so close in composition, performance and overall skin feeling that I can tell no difference between the two. It is one of the best shaving creams I have had the pleasure of using. It&#x27;s best used with a brush which enables you to get a beautiful thick lather. But I have also applied it directly to my wet face. Just a small amount directly to the skin and then later with fingertips will also give you a perfectly acceptable shave. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with C.O. Bigelow&#x27;s shaving cream! It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used out of any of the brands sold in stores.  I use the Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide while shaving and each time, no hair is missed and the ease and comfort of the shaving cream goes a long way.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Well, like the title says, this is the best shaving cream I have ever used.  It feels like you have mint on your face after you&#x27;re done :D</li>
    <li> This is my 5th or 6th tube of this stuff.  I have sensitive skin and everything make me break out or get a rash.  Shaving has been hell.  I switched to a double edged razor and this shaving cream.  My life has greatly improved.  It&#x27;s smells lovely and I get the best shaves now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I tried the other proraso shaving creams in both tube and can form.  Tube all the way, even if the pump on the cans is more convenient. OnceI finish up the current can (which feels like it makes my razor drag on my skin) I will return to this tube.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and my local store stopped carrying it so I ordered 3 units and got the free shipping.    I have the Worlds Toughest Beard and tenderest skin. Said by a barber with a straight razor who cut my face to shreds.(a little exaggerated).    Anyway this product lasts a long time around 3 to 6 months because you don&#x27;t need to use much. I apply it with a Shave Brush and recommend it very highly.    Some shave creams are too slippery and the hair doesn&#x27;t shave right. And some are not slippery enough and you get cuts.     This cream is perfect.</li>
    <li> At first I was very skeptical about buying this shaving cream.  Before this year I had only ever bought Gillette or similar types of shaving creams so when I discovered The Art of Shaving line of products I was pretty blown away.  However, the price of those products also blew me away.  So I began my search for a new shaving cream and this is where I landed.  Price wise this is about half the price of The Art of Shaving, shaving cream and in my opinion I get the same great lather.  The only difference that I could notice was the smell and I actually prefer this Eucalyptus scent to the sandalwood I was getting from Art of Shaving.  So if you&#x27;re looking for a comparable product and don&#x27;t want to spend 24 dollars on a thing of shaving cream this is probably your best bet.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for over 5 years and it is the best I have found. It last a long time since you only use a very small amount. It helps to give a close shave and leave your face nice and smooth. It is very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Shavings a pleasure while using this cream. Razor glides effortlessly and face is left smooth, clean &amp; fresh. I always keep some on hand.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff - got it for him for a Christmas stocking stuffer and he loves it</li>
    <li> Best shave cream ever</li>
    <li> I have not really enjoyed this cream at all. I tried it because I was advised that with my new razor this would be a good purchase. I find that my regular shaving cream is far more helpful then this.</li>
    <li> A nickel sized dollop of this shaving cream in a bowl, whipped up with a brush will produce enough lather for three complete shave passes. A dime sized dollop will get you two plus. Smells great, and protects your skin. It does everything it is supposed to do, and does it very well, and won&#x27;t gunk up in your razor. No more canned foam, or gel.</li>
    <li> This is a go-to product for any safety razor user simply because it yields a quality shave with a crisp, uncompromising scent that lends well to any style. Make no mistake, the menthol scent is present but not oppressive as many other imitators are. There is also distinction in the shave quality this product by Proraso provides - it is second to none by itself, unparalleled when paired with a like shave oil. If the cream dries out on your face in the middle of a quality shave, simply re-apply water and the cream springs back to original quality. In summation, this product is worth your hard-earned money and time every morning spent shaving. There is no equal.</li>
    <li> Provides for a great shave and more comfortable shave. Cheaper and easier than going to the store; delivered to my door.</li>
    <li> I really like Proraso, it has a cooling sensation during and after shaving. The scent is fresh and makes a nice thick lather with little cream and little effort. Will be buying more when needed.</li>
    <li> He Just loves this shave cream.  He has been using it for years and won&#x27;t switch.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a DE-razor user, it&#x27;s hard to beat this stuff. Smells great, lathers great, a little goes a long way. Man, how many tubes of this stuff have graced my bathroom sink? I dunno. The point is this: if you prefer tube cream instead of soap cakes, you owe it to yourself to try this. It&#x27;s more or less the same as Proraso, but I&#x27;ll swear not exactly the same (I could be wrong about that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside: if you&#x27;re having trouble getting a decent lather out of your cream, pick up a gallon of distilled water next time you go to the supermarket and use that in your scuttle/cup instead of tap water. Lather for DAYS...</li>
    <li> Best shave cream for the old fashioned shave...a little goes a long way. Better than anything you can buy off the shelves.</li>
    <li> Shaving cream in the can gives me a rash.  This leaves my face feeling clean with a bit of tingle.  You only need a couple pea sized clumps, worked up to a lather with brush, or your hand if you don&#x27;t have a brush.  A tube lasts me 4 to 5 months</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other shave creams and Bigelow is by far the best.  It only takes a very small amount to get a whole face full of good lather and it stands up .  I think it really requires a good brush to apply but I will use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> Great shave.Feels cool and comfortable.I have used many shave creams and this product ranks up with the best of them.</li>
    <li> Excellent Shaving Cream with a nice Eucalyptus finish.  Will re-purchase.</li>
    <li> Old-school shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allows a great, close shave.  Has a cooling menthol feel to it.  I liked it enough I bought some for my son and he loved it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice smell......you only need a tiny bit  and it spreads all over your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through a lot of brands so based on reviews, I thought I&#x27;ve give this one a try. I hate to say that I&#x27;m not impressed by the lather or feel under the razor. I do like the menthol in the mix and if you work at it long enough, the lather does get creamy. It was worth a try and I can see why some love this but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> Great product - very economical and easy to take a small amount when travelling.  A week&#x27;s worth fits in a contact lens case.</li>
    <li> This is just re-branded Proraso. If you have used Proraso before... you know what this is. I like the smell and the the shave I get with this stuff. It lathers up quickly. It makes me feel pretty freaking fancy when I use it. Like I should shave while wearing a top hat and a monocle while scoffing at the lowly 99%&#x27;ers. Suck it poor people!</li>
    <li> Though my nephew may enjoy the product, I was NOT happy about the way it shipped.  Purchased this as a stocking stuffer. It came in an envelope, unprotected, so the tube is crushed some.  Very surprised they would not use cushioned!  Box for Bigelow was bent to heck and back.  Bigelow is a great line, but I will rethink where I purchase it, in the future. This is my 1st complaint from an Amazon provider.  Good to read the guys enjoy it!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to those who appreciate the art of the classic shave. Feels great on your face due to the eucalyptus. Also when accompanied with a shaving brush you only have to use a dime sized amount, making it last for months. Love this product and also other C.O. Bigelow products.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaving cream! He said it is the best !</li>
    <li> I found this shaving cream to be one of the best I&#x27;ve used to date. It lathers quickly and easily with a boar brush and goes on even. Once applied the lather remains throughout the shave unlike some other shave creams and soaps that tend to dissolve over time. At first the feeling seemed a bit odd as it tends to numb the face a bit. However, after a few passes I grew accustom to it and it started to feel great. It is one of the most comfortable creams that I&#x27;ve used. It feels great on the skin, lathers easily, and lasts. It also leaves the skin feeling great afterwards. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> A buddy of mine gave me this for a birthday a few years ago and I finally ran out.  It lasts forever and leaves your skin feeling refreshed.  Although it&#x27;s more expensive than the crap you buy at Target, the longevity makes it a better value.  I think it&#x27;s probably the best shaving cream planet earth.</li>
    <li> Stumbled upon this product in NYC and fell in love with it! I couldn&#x27;t find it locally so ordered online... I did end up finding it at Bath &amp; Body Works who has a &amp;#34;never-ending buy 2, get 2 free&amp;#34; sale for this line according to the lady at the shop... so I may just buy it there to save $ but regardless - it&#x27;s an excellent product!</li>
    <li> Ian Ginsberg-Third Generation C.O. Bigelow Proprietor and Pharmacist is quoted on the packaging as saying...    \\&quot;I set out to find a shaving cream that gave the closest, coolest shave on earth. My search landed me in Italy where I discovered one of the most incredible shaving formulas known to man. Favored by Italian barbers, this creamy, softening lather formula protects all skin types, cools the skin and gives a truly exceptional shave.\\&quot;    This is essentially Proraso repackaged. The product packaging does read that it&#x27;s made exclusively by Proraso for C.O. Bigelow. The 10 dollar price here is exactly what I paid for the very same product in this 5.2 oz tube at Bath and Body Works. For years I&#x27;ve done what most guys these days have done...I paid for canned chemical foam for 94 cents a pop, and for all those years my shave was just as cheap as the can it came in. I tried spending the extra dollars on the canned gel to be even more disappointed. I&#x27;ll gladly pay 10 dollars for a shaving cream that helps provide and luxurious and comfortable shave. The lather quickly whips up to an ultra-white meringue of menthol and eucalyptus. The smell is clean, refreshing and VERY invigorating. The tingle is unmistakable and I can still feel the coolness of the ingredients well after the shave.     The directions read: \\&quot;Apply an ample amount to wet hands to build up a great lather or use with a brush. Apply to face, shave and rinse.\\&quot; -My preferred method is with my badger hair shaving brush soaked in hot water and I shave post-shower. I add about a nickle sized drop of cream to my shaving bowl and swirl. I can immediately smell the release of the eucalyptus oils and my face feels the unmistakable sensation from the menthol. My shaves are very smooth, close and compared to some other soaps I have tried in the past, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin tight or dry. The lather is slick, classically clean, and crisp. Somehow, that is all nicely balanced with a feel and scent that is almost medicinal but NOT in a bad way.     Everything about this product seems to be a throwback to a simpler time--inside and out. From it&#x27;s muted design and metal tube, it&#x27;s a product I can see my great grandfather using as it just has those certain old-time aesthetics that scream simple quality. I think  if anyone is going to make that cross over to the world of wet-shaving, don&#x27;t go cheap. Quality tools and products will set you up for a future of money saving shaves and a baby-butt smooth face once you perfect your own technique. In my opinion, this premium shave cream should be a part of every man&#x27;s shaving regimen.     For travel, a tube of this shaving cream with its screw top lid just can&#x27;t be beat. It takes up much less space and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the button on the canned foam or gel getting pressed and those wet soap cakes can be just as messy. However, I&#x27;ll still take those soap pucks over anything in a can but since I&#x27;ve found this C.O. Bigelow Premium Shave Cream, I&#x27;LL TAKE THIS ABOVE ALL ELSE! It&#x27;s touted as the \\&quot;#1 Shaving Cream in Italian Barber Shops\\&quot;---and I can see why.</li>
    <li> I love it!!  Great mild scent, lathers up nice with the brush and much less expensive and EASIER to find than some of the other stuff.    This is great for also shaving the fur off of roadkill, and leaves the critter with a nice manly smell.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t buy this on amazon I get it at bed bath and body works where it retails for less than amazon&#x27;s price and they also always have a promotion of some kind. This is the ideal shave cream because of the cooling sensation, lathering, and longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the very beginning the cooling sensation can be unusual especially under your nose when you breath but you quickly get used to it and very quickly begin to enjoy it. It&#x27;s quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will lather even without a brush even with hard water, hell it might even lather over ice cubes and sand it will lather with anything and in any situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube will last a very long time making it a good buy.</li>
    <li> My favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this stuff, I love how it gently tingles and cools my skin as I shave. I have bought tubes and tubes of this stuff and am only on my second one. I just never want to run out! (by the way, this stuff is the same as proraso green, just in a shiny tube)</li>
    <li> My dad loves the strong Eucalyptus scent.  I have to buy it every year for his birthday.  He says Cremo Cream smells weird.  He doesn&#x27;t use a brush with the Bigelow cream, just his hands.</li>
    <li> What can I say, you&#x27;ll want to use this C.O. Bigelow Shave Cream everyday. It has a rich thick lather, wonderful aroma and a very soothing sensation that cools. Now that I know about this, I will never be without it.</li>
    <li> This is nice and refreshing, already halfway through it, but am a fan of C.O. Bigelow thanks to this order.</li>
    <li> I was led to this product by a prominant mens magazine, and was further swayed by the great reviews on Amazon.  However, after using it a few times initially, I shelved it and was not impressed.  I would have probably given it three stars at that point (average).  Well, today I HAD to use it, as I was out of my usual drug-store brand.  I had about three to four days of growth, and I have a very tough beard.  Well, let it be said, this stuff is not suitable if either of those situations apply to you.  I applied it as per the instructions, and nearly tore my face off trying to shave with this stuff.  With a modern multiblade razor, you have to go over the same spot two to three times, to get to the skin. Even worse, like my headline said, this stuff has the consistency of Vaseline, and gunks up the razor rediculously.  I used a brand new Gillete Fusion Power, and it still had problems.  If this stuff is meant to be used with a straight or safety razor, it should say so on the package.  I have never really been happy with \\&quot;premium\\&quot; shaving creams, they never seem to work better for me than the generic gels.  I generously gave the product one star, as it does make your skin feel nice, once you finally finish shaving.  And that is until 20 mins later, when the razor burn really sets in.  Ouch!</li>
    <li> Fantastic shaving cream.  Smells very good and foams up easily to give a great shave.  Very happy with the E. oil it has.</li>
    <li> Discovered this probably 7 years ago now.  This is the best shaving cream you can get.. for the price.  I buy it as gifts and stocking stuffers all the time.  People fall in love with it.. seriously.</li>
    <li> I have had a problem with razor burn in the past and this stuff definitely has helped relieve it. I would give it a higher rating but I bought it at  $12.94, but then found out you can get it cheaper in store at Bath and Body Works, which sold it at $10 for one or $20 for three.</li>
    <li> This is part of my regular rotation.  It&#x27;s nice to put a little of this on a glycerine based shaving soap in a shaving mug.  With a good brush, a bit of water and a little time one can whip up some excellent lather for close shave.  The nice eucalyptus scent really adds to the mix.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for a year and a half and like it more all the time.Lasts a good long time and great with double edge blade shaving.Great old school ritual.</li>
    <li> Being new to the safety razor, this seemed like a good cream to go with. I do like the feel and fragrance. Helps to wake me up in the morning!</li>
    <li> Interesting... feels very cool after shaving. Downside is that it doesn&#x27;t clear completely off and I have to rinse. Overall, an interesting purchase.</li>
    <li> This by far the best shaving cream I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it lather up  fast but it keeps your face fresh after shaving and I&#x27;m sure it prevent razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;You can feel the eucalyptus oils.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing the Saftey Razor and shaving soap pucks for awhile and thought I would try something different.  So I bought C.O. Bigelow and Proraso and to me they seem identical.  This shaving creme lathers very well and the smell and feeling on the skin is very refreshing.  And I seem to get a closer and smoother shave then with other shaving soap.  All in all a great product and I would highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Best product I have found for shaving my legs. Helps prevent dryness.  Nice scent. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love how this product lathers up. It smells great and really goes a long ways. A good deal and buy.</li>
    <li> Lathers extremely well.  It&#x27;s highly concentrated, so it lasts a really long time, which makes it very affordable compared to the competition.</li>
    <li> Double edged razor.. alum bar.. and Proraso shaving cream............ the 3 products that give you the BEST SHAVE. It give you a nice clean fresh sensation.. it gives you the rich lather that you need to get that nice clean shaving.. and it smells great.</li>
    <li> No clue how people write 500 words on shaving cream. 1) It is great for a smooth shave, 2) it smells nice and gives your face a little tingle, 3) it doesn&#x27;t leave a rust ring on your tub. Basically it is the best shaving cream I have ever used. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Economical and very good shaving lather created with a badger brush and mug. Pleasant scent too. Easy to lather up to a rich and satisfying level.</li>
    <li> My quest for the best shave cream stopped here! Nice crisp masculine odor. So glad it&#x27;s in my life now!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shaving cream I&#x27;ve found so far. It&#x27;s very effective, easy to lather and one tube will last you a really, really long time.</li>
    <li> I typically build up a lather on my face, and after shaving I can still smell the stuff, which can be very good if you&#x27;re stuffy.  A little goes a long way, too!</li>
    <li> $10, righteous. I enjoy the powerful cooling sensation on my face, but I can understand why it might not be for everyone. If you&#x27;re feeling up for some minty freshness, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t praise this enough. I also own ToBs, so I&#x27;ll compare that to this throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- smell: outstanding! Its manly. It wont smell weird even though it has menthol or eucalyptus. Personally, I am not a big fan of menthol/eucalyptus smell, but I must say I LOVE how this smells. I actually look forward to its smell each time I shave. I would even say that this proraso/bigelow product rates much, much higher on smell than any of ToBs&#x27; products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-lather: nice, clean, rich lather. Makes for a very comfortable shave. It does produce some dryness, esp in the skin around my lips. To be honest, though, ToBs does much better in this department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a really fine product that smells manly.</li>
    <li> Try some of this on your skin like your sack and it will give a nice conditioned grippy feel after you rinse it off.</li>
    <li> C.O. Bigelow/Proaso.  I just shop for the best deal - and that includes me driving to the Bath and Body Works store where this is sold.</li>
    <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW - OUTDATED&lt;br /&gt;This cream used to be fantastic (it is made by Proraso), but they recently changed their formula.&lt;br /&gt;The new version is mediocre at best. It feels dry, does not soothe the skin the way the old formula did, and no longer smells of menthol and eucalyptus.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/18/12&lt;br /&gt;I have discovered that this cream needs a lot more water and more \\&quot;brush time\\&quot; to take it to the right consistency.&lt;br /&gt;However, once you get it there it is just as good as the original if not a little better.&lt;br /&gt;The soothing feeling is still there, and there is no dryness. The blade glides smoothly over your face.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that the Menthol smell is very subdued, but some people will consider this a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I like this better than Proraso--even though Proraso makes it.  It has, it seems to me, more menthol, and I like that very much.</li>
    <li> I know that some people here enjoy shaving... let me start out by saying that I&#x27;m not one of those people. Why? I&#x27;ve always had issues shaving due to sensitive skin combined with thick, coarse facial hair (a minor downfall of Italian heritage!). Being a working professional in my mid 20&#x27;s, I wanted to stop rockin&#x27; the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and get on a regular shaving regimen. After reading numerous blogs and websites devoted to shaving, I decided to purchase a Merkur Futur double-edged safety razor (great investment). Along with that, I wanted to use a cream that is tried/true... so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shave cream has a very pleasant smell, requires only a small (nickel sized) amount to be effective, and helps to soften my face right before shaving. The bottle is huge and will easily last a daily shaver 6-8 months, so the cost savings is tremendous compared to the store-bought creams. Not to mention, as corny as it sounds, I enjoy mixing up a foamy lather with my badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I shave, I&#x27;ll update this review with a photo of the lather I get. It&#x27;s pretty insane!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a note to potential users: in my readings on various shaving-related websites, I found (and later verified) that the quality of lather highly depends on the brush used, along with a bowl to mix it in and a certain ratio of water/cream. If you are new to this method, a site that helped me a lot was ShaveNation.com. He&#x27;s got lots of helpful tutorials and all that jazz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shaving!</li>
    <li> I have been missing the menthol shaving cream I could find at the corner drugstore (remember those?) while growing up.  That&#x27;s one of the reasons I switched to wet shaving and this is the best shave lathering material I&#x27;ve found!  Careful balance of H2O + Bigelow cream x quick badger brush lather action &#x3D; thick, rich shaving lather possessing excellent lubrication properties.  It&#x27;s a little expensive, but aren&#x27;t us guys worth it?  I don&#x27;t have any hair on my head anymore, so my &amp;#34;Guy Product&amp;#34; budget goes for shaving.</li>
    <li> The GOOD: Superior shave results over the goop you get in a can. Great lather. Less skin irritation as it has great skin lubrication. Smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BAD: Expensive, But U definitely get what you pay for with Bigelow Shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it if you don&#x27;t mind paying more for good shave results. I bought a tube of this 6 months back when I first started to using a straight razor. Only use this stuff one a week when I have time to properly shave right with the straight razor &amp; it has lasted. Still have more than half tube left.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaving cream / soap I have ever used!  It lathers up easily to a rich and thickness that brushes easily on your face. I think you could just use your fingers to rub it on but a brush does such a better job. It is so creamy that my DE razor glides over it without any effort at all. I used it for a second swipe and it felt so good!  After the shave my face felt smooth without any nicks, cuts or bumps. My skin was left soft without any dryness. The menthol smell is great and not overpowering. I use an old school after shave such as Clubman or Aqua Velva to top off the barbershop effect. This is a great shave cream at a tremendous value. You can use a higher priced cream but this is my cream of choice.</li>
    <li> I think they removed some of the &amp;#34;potentially harmful&amp;#34; ingredients from Proraso and replaced them with something else.  It lathers the same, cools the same, but it does get a bit dryer faster than the original Proraso.  I still plan to buy this though, again and again.</li>
    <li> They say that smells stay in your memory the longest; longer than sights or sounds. That is 100% true. My wife got me this cream as a gift and immediately upon unscrewing the cap I recognized the smell. My father taught me how to shave using this same cream some 35 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being of middle eastern origins, I have very stubborn and thick hair. I can also grow a full beard in a week&#x27;s time. Sometimes I will shave twice a day if we have a function in the evening. This cream is absolutely the best. A tube will also last you a long time. I highly recommend using a badger hair brush, also available on Amazon. Soak it in hot water then separate the bristles with your thumb. Add a pea-size bead of this cream and run the hot water (very briefly) on it then lather your beard. The cream has added moisturizer in it if you have particularly sensitive skin. Great for my son who just started shaving last year. He just doesn&#x27;t have the patience for a real shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also prefer Gillette sensor excel double razor shavers as the head doesn&#x27;t flop around like the three-razor shavers. And recommend Nivea replenishing post shave balm. Great comfort without the alcohol burn. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Simply the best shaving experience I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product and keep using it.  However, it does dry out my skin pretty badly so I have to moisturize afterwards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a wet shaver using a DE razor and just got this product for Christmas. This stuff lathers like crazy. Just a small amount on my shave brush and it lathers perfectly for the entire shave, and then some. The eucalyptus oil is nice and refreshing, but wish it also came in other scents. But this stuff is awesome. I&#x27;ll never buy the canned stuff again.</li>
    <li> The best.  Try it.  I guarantee you&#x27;ll love it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 years and have never used anything else since I tried it.</li>
    <li> This is the one of the best shave creams I have tried and well worth the premium price. Keep in mind however, that it works best applied with a shaving brush</li>
    <li> I like this shaving cream very much. I would suggest using this with a shaving brush; all you need is a small wooden lather bowl in which to mix it. You only need a small blob of cream for the whole shave. I&#x27;ve tried applying it by hand, but found it too thick right out of the tube. The other thing is, it lasts longer than those clunky, non-recyclable cans.</li>
    <li> Received this for my birthday.  I&#x27;m your typical Barbosol/Colgate $1 a can shave cream guy.  I said to my wife, It&#x27;s nice, but, it&#x27;s just soap....&lt;br /&gt;Ah ignorance.  Used it this morning with a 3 week old Mach 3 blade and applied it with my fingertips.  The best, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve EVER had.  My skin is as soft and smooth as a baby&#x27;s.  Hooked, sold, done.  4 hours later, still smooth.  Great scent.</li>
    <li> I got my boyfriend a safety razor kit for his birthday, however it didn&#x27;t come with shaving cream or soap, so I had go ask around for some recommendations. This one was highly recommended by his friend, and I&#x27;m personally very happy with it! It has a nice eucalyptus smell, but isn&#x27;t too overwhelming, and it leaves my boyfriend&#x27;s skin very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t rinse off very well. Though I think this could be very easily remedied by using a washcloth to help gently rub it off with water. My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t own a face cloth and doesn&#x27;t wish to buy one, so you&#x27;ll have to test that out yourself.</li>
    <li> This produces a great lather and is very cool and refreshing on the skin.  It provides good lubrication while shaving, and the previous tube lasted just over a year.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaving cream because I had received a small product sample at the mall. After using the full sized product for a couple of weeks at home, I&#x27;m sold that this is the last shaving cream I&#x27;ll use for a long time. Here&#x27;s what I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It only takes a small amount to work up into a lather to cover your entire face. And this leads to one tube of shaving cream lasting a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;- I get a very effective shave using this cream along with my Gillette Fusion Turbo. No ingrown hairs. No razor burns. Just a clean and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;- It smells very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that if you do get this product, you&#x27;ll most likely also need a shaving brush, and ideally some sort of shaving bowl to work up the lather.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this shaving cream. The smell is refreshing, without being overpowering, and it gets my face ready for a great shave. A big improvement over more generic products I had purchased in the past, canned shaving creams with tons of additives. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and it seems it will last me more than long enough to merit the investment. A good buy all around.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is not good at all, it doesn&#x27;t lubricate well, the lather is fluffy but thin and I do not water it down. My shave with this cream is not comfortable at all. This cream also leaves your face dry; it has no moisturizing properties. I guess I was spoiled Art of Shaving Unscented was my first brush type shaving cream and it blows this out of the water. The Art of Shaving Unscented lathers much more (amount) with less cream, the lather is thick and it leaves your face extremely soft after the shave. I have used this (C.O. Bigelow) cream with both a shavette and a safety razor on my face and body and it performed poorly with both. If you are looking for a good shaving cream that provides a comfortable shave C.O. Bigelow is not it look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Heard good things about this product and gave it a try. I do not feel any difference. Next time I will go back to edge gel that I used before.</li>
    <li> Awesome love it.. Feel good get what you expected. Why do I have to keep writing? A+++++  A+ A+ A+</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream I have ever used.  I would never go back to other brands.  I have sensitive skin and it does not bother me.  Creates such a smooth shave you could probably use a dull butter knife and get a close shave.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of an olde-timey barbershop shave.</li>
    <li> One of these tubes will last me a year! The amount needed for a shave is far less than you would think. I love this stuff. The closest shave with a razor possible. I just wish they made blades as well.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff, but the packaging is terrible. Cap keeps breaking, tube is metallic and difficult to roll. Would be 5-stars if these guys were on the same level as toothpaste manufacturers.</li>
    <li> I am a picky shaver.  I am also rather clumsy, and not adroit enough to use a safety razor.  I shave with a Gilette Fusion Power, despite the ridiculous cost.  Fortunately I don&#x27;t have to shave too often - maybe every three days, so the blades do last a long time if I take care of them properly.  To accompany these absurdly expensive razor heads, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of shave creams, gels, lotions over the years, always sticking with the best I can find, but continuing to experiment in case something better is out there.  I&#x27;ve stuck with C.O. Bigelow for years.  Feels great on the skin, close shave, feels terrific afterwards, and most importantly, wife likes the results and the smell.  I shave in the shower, so skins already warm and wet, and the Bigelow lathers nicely - not too much, not too little.  Put a line down the fingers of one hand, rub &#x27;em together to later up, and massage it on my face.  A bit of work with the badger brush to work it in and raise the whiskers, and away we go.  I sometimes shave my scalp as well, and I like it there too, though one must be careful not to get it in one&#x27;s eyes, because the menthol burns something nasty.</li>
    <li> This is my second tube of Proraso/C.O. Bigelow Shave Cream.  The first tube lasted about 7 months.  I put a bit into a shave cup, swirl the brush and get a consistently nice lather.  It is as nice or better than The Art of Shaving soaps and others I have used.  It leaves a nice scent that isn&#x27;t strong.</li>
    <li> To be honest im not sure if this is BETTER than the rest..havent tried anything else but i dont use a lot and i can say i get a close shave each time.  Make this a VERY close shave!!!</li>
    <li> This gives the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  A dab about this size of a nickel will produce enough thick lather to shave two times.  I use this with a badger brush and mug.  Unlike the canned stuff, this washes away cleanly and leaves your skin soft and not dried out or irritated.  Use this once and you&#x27;ll never go back to canned products.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be cowed by the ratings - this is a weak cream, not dissimilar from other Proraso products.  If you can get it really cheap, like below $7 a tube, it will do.  But for the money wait for any TOBS variant to go on sale.  Or better yet spike for the GFT stuff when it floats down to $15.  This cream is just weak and doesn&#x27;t protect.  Beautiful tube - fascinating to know this is a #1 product in Italian shops - underwhelming performance.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous shaving cream ...the Best I have ever used</li>
    <li> This is a repackaging of Prorasoa&#x27;s green cream, and it is great for wet shaving. Started out bowl lathering with a Tweezerman brush but recently decided I like face lathering better, and it lathers up quickly and thick. The tube was also much bigger than I expected, you use about a dime or almond sized amount each shave but this is bigger than many toothpaste tubes and filled to the brim. Will last a very long time, well worth the money. The scent seemed strange at first, but I&#x27;ve grown to really like it and associate it with a great shave now.</li>
    <li> As others have stated, this is not the same as the original formula Proraso- this is the new and &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; (paraben-free) version. Compared to the old formulation, this cream is a bit softer and it seems to take a little more to adequately cover &amp; lubricate my face for a shave.  Admittedly, I&#x27;m still getting used to this so maybe it will grow on me with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I still think this is one of the better shaving creams available at this price point. In my opinion and experience, it&#x27;s 100x better than anything you&#x27;re going to get from a can!</li>
    <li> Best shave cream experience I&#x27;ve ever had. It definetely needs a badger to work out a great lather and you can do it with just a nutshell drop rubbing it on the palm of your hand. Smell and feeling is great!</li>
    <li> Very good stuff. Great compliments on the arpma.</li>
    <li> I bought it in a store rather than amazon. I picked it up after hearing tons of rave reviews about it. After using it I can say I&#x27;m definitely not impressed. My regular is proraso in the tub and they are nothing alike. It smells and feels ok on the face, though nothing remarkable. It takes forever to get a good lather compared to every other soap I&#x27;ve used. Once you put it on it dries very quickly. The shave wasn&#x27;t smooth at all, the razor skipping in places because it&#x27;s so dry. Needless to say I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Speick for several years and am very pleased with the product. For a change of pace, I bought this Bigelow cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Printed on the tube is &amp;#34;made by Proraso&amp;#34; (I do not know if this product is the same as Proraso). The Bigelow cream is really good. I notice that the blade glides much more smoothly than with Speick. Alike the Speick, a small dollop easily covers the face and you should take a minute to thoroughly rub the cream to build a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this tube of product is HUGE! I know that it says 5.2 ounces - it is like a big tube of toothpaste.</li>
    <li> In the world of &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; shaving creams you can&#x27;t beat this stuff. For a third of the price you have something that works as well as the much fancier creams. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is that it smells funky to me. In fact I think it is stinky. However, the stuff gives you such a good shave and leaves your face feeling cool and smooth, so much so, that I can overlook the smell. It is basically the American version of an old Italian shave cream, it is every bit as good as the Italian shave cream (in fact it has the same exact ingredients). Love this stuff. Use it on my face and head, and gives a great shave and the smell does not linger.</li>
    <li> I started using this stuff a while before I \\&quot;discovered\\&quot; wet shaving. My wife picked this up at a local Bath and Body Works. When I first started using it, it was used out of the tube, no bowl no brush with a Gilette Mach-3.&lt;br /&gt;After I had my epiphany, got a EJ DE89L razor and started wet shaving with this stuff. NOW I really got to appreciate it. With some practice it makes a fantastic creamy lather from a ½ inch of product. Lube is excellent and it leaves a very clean and refreshing feeling post shave.&lt;br /&gt;It was only after I joined the shaving blogs that I realized this stuff was made by Proraso. Now I am hooked. I hear from some this IS the same product under the CO Bigelow name. That I won&#x27;t know until I try a tube of the OEM Proraso cream.</li>
