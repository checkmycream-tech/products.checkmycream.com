    <li> Avery cute...smells nice.. fast shipping</li>
    <li> Very floral and sweet not similar to the original G like I hoped it would be but for this size at this price I won&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
    <li> great buy and my lil girl loved the figuring. The smell was decent and very unique. it got a pass.</li>
    <li> Smells great. 15 year old daughter loves it. Cute bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this scent before and I wanted to buy it again. The price is really great so I was really happy about that too. It&#x27;s pretty fruity. A lot of people notice it and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments. I honestly don&#x27;t know if it fades, I&#x27;m assuming the scent fades with time, but after I spray it on myself I can&#x27;t really smell it, but I get compliments through out the day so it lasts a while.</li>
    <li> I admit, I always buy the Harajuku perfumes with no idea what they smell like. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed. Some fragrances I like more than others, but I also buy these because the bottles are so cute. I like this fragrance. It is a light and sweet scent.</li>
    <li> SUPER CUTE!! WHAT A NICE ADDITION TO MY COLLECTION!! BOX ARRIVED IN PERFECT SHAPE &amp; THE BOTTLE IS SO STINKIN CUTE I GET COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME!! SCENT SMELLED OF A FRUIT LIKE TO ME, AS OF A PEAR?</li>
    <li> I pretty much only purchased it for the bottle and the design.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is sweet and even though I normally hate sugary smells, I was able to stand this one. It was very lightly sweetened. The smell did last some time on me, not all day but I&#x27;d say like half of the day.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason the doll&#x27;s outfit started chipping off almost immediately after I took it out of the box. I wasn&#x27;t too pleased by that but I fixed it with some clear nail polish to stop it from chipping.&lt;br /&gt;This was an okay purchase.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping love it!! Super cute</li>
    <li> My daughter is is 14 and is in love with the Gwen Stefani series of fragrances, and is on a mission to own them all.  Right now she is in the super phase, and this will definitely make her happy on Christmas.  So cute!</li>
    <li> Ordered this for the bottle and when it arrive it was cuter than expected and the perfume smells amazing! I&#x27;m not much of a perfume wearer but this is one that I will actually wear!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so nice even though it comes in a cute little cartoon bottle. It reminds me of the power puff girls from back in the day.You&#x27;d probably think it&#x27;s not for the mature but your wrong it&#x27;s for all ages. This scent smells like sweet pineapples, but with a fresh light mellow smell. I&#x27;m not sure how long it last but I&#x27;ll do a update on how long it last soon. I would wear this scent during the summer ,but it can be worn during any time of the season.</li>
    <li> always fan of harajuku perfumes.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for christmas and she just loved it. She has a collection of all these type of perfumes but this was her favorite. It is very sweet smelling and maybe for younger girls but my mom in is her fortys and she loved the bottle and perfume. If you like sweet smells and cute bottles, this is for you. Fast shipping and excellent packaging.</li>
    <li> Gwen Stefani makes the most adorable perfume bottles. I bought a trial size of Harajuku Lovers Music and the bottle is just so cute. Every bottle that Gwen has put out is like a mini doll and that adds to the appeal. I did not know that when I bough the mini one if I would be getting a regular bottle or the one with the figure on top. I was very pleased to open it and see a mini Harajuku Lover figurine. I will be buying more of these soon!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and smells good</li>
    <li> I bought this because I really loved the bottle, and it&#x27;s absolutely cute as can be seen.&lt;br /&gt;The scent it&#x27;s just quite normal. Is a eau de toilette. Very very fruity (I smell banana and raspberry mainly, a little bit of tangerine too).&lt;br /&gt;I like it but maybe could be a bodymist or shampoo (I really want a shampoo with this smell, it would be great). I don&#x27;t know if this fragrance can be a someone&#x27;s signature scent because It&#x27;s not special for me, it&#x27;s just a nice smell. It reminds me a Disney&#x27;s The Little Mermaid lip balm that I had when I was a little girl</li>
    <li> I collect the G series. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s. Love the bottles and the scent. This bottle was sent to me for Christmas from my husband. He paid around $45 plus shipping. I&#x27;m not complaining about the gift. I&#x27;m a bit upset that it was apparently sent from Marshall&#x27;s. The sticker says &amp;#34;compare at $45&amp;#34; and the price at Marshall&#x27;s was $19.99. We will be more attentive to where our items are shipped from in the future. Maybe I&#x27;ll check out Marshall&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Holy crap, I ordered this perfume in the afternoon and received it the next day, no special shipping option selected or anything! Very impressed and happy with this :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I collect these perfumes mostly for the cute bottles, but this scent is actually very nice, a light rosy floral scent perfect for spring or summer. This bottle has a much different pose than the others and I didn&#x27;t think it looked very cute, but I wanted to complete my collection, but I ended up really liking it once I saw it in person.</li>
    <li> My daughter is a superhero junkie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item fit right in with her birthday theme.  Nice scent.  Upset that it was a limited edition, but it was great.</li>
    <li> this shipping was great i got it super fast but the perfume itself does not smell great it smells kind of warm and bitter....but the bottle is very cute but if your getting it for the scent i would go for harajuku lovers lil angel, or maybe harajuku lovers g</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Gwen!!  Her scents are as unique and charming as she is. Not overwhelming.  Just very nice.</li>
    <li> I got this for my GF who collects the &amp;#34;G&amp;#34; Harajukus. She loves it and it comes in a nice collectible box. It&#x27;s also the best smelling one of the bunch IMHO.</li>
