      <li>I have not personally used, but she was delighted with the colors!  </li>
      <li>The colors are vibrant and they stay on for a good length of time.  </li>
      <li>The colors shine and I am a huge fan of glitter polish.</li>
      <li>Only one good use per bottle.  </li>
      <li>I got these for my sister for Christmas, the colors are very pretty but some of the nail polishes were chunky and unusable.</li>

      <li>This particular seller shipped out quickly and I had it in plenty of time for Christmas.</li>
      <li>I have found Kleancolor to be a pretty decent and inexpensive brand of nail polish!</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward for this set.</li>
      <li>Bought these mini bottles of nail polish for my daughter and she really likes them.  </li>
      <li>They work out very well.</li>
      <li>The bottles are small, but I only need them once in a while for the odd kind of nail design, so I am happy with that.</li>
      <li>Nice color but not strong on nails.</li>
      <li>These are the LITTLE bottles and for me it costs too much for the amount of polish, however I love Kleancolor and have over 20 polishes</li>
      <li>This is the 2nd or 3rd I have bought of this brand, I love it</li>
      <li>Cute little polishes.</li>
      <li>The colors are really cute but the green one turns my skin</li>
      <li>often the early chipping won&#x27;t bother you anyway!</li>
      <li>But they worked fine for dotting to make little holly leaves and berries.</li>
      <li>I bought this product for a gift for my young cousin who loves doing her nails.  </li>
      <li>My daughter loved the colors and the sparkles and is crazy about nail polish.  </li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it seems to take WAY longer to dry that normal polish and seems to be more gel like which makes it easier to peel off than traditional nail polish.</li>
      <li>they were pretty dried up.</li>
      <li>Something that I didn&#x27;t realize in the picture was that the red, green, and blue have glitter in them, but fine glitter not like the other 3 that have the chunky stuff.</li>
      <li>The polish dries quickly and it was cheap&#x27; now for the bad: the smell lingers for HOURS...</li>

<li> just the cost on so little with this one got me...</li>
<li> I used a few of the colors.</li>
<li> this is not for you if you are looking for the usual size nail polish.</li>
<li> The small size was purchased to have nail polish on hand when I travel.</li>
<li> Now they are small but they seem too hold a lot of polish.</li>
<li> so y&#x27;all know, they are really small.</li>
<li> Nail polish bottles was really to small</li>
<li> You need to do at least two to three coats.</li>
<li> very disappointed that the blue and green are so thick that they are unusable.</li>
<li> These nail polishes were very thick - to the point of not going on well.  </li>
<li> but I was really disappointed.</li>

    <li> This was a great set of fingernail polishes with lots of glitter. I feel this set is good for toes. I plan too use this set with my daughter for mom and daughter bonding. If you love glitter this polish will provide variety. Now they are small but they seem too hold a lot of polish.</li>

    <li> I used a few of the colors. They didn&#x27;t last long. The polish starts to peel and chip the same day you put it on.</li>
    <li> These nail polishes were very thick - to the point of not going on well.  Only one good use per bottle.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift for Christmas to a younger child who loves nail polish.  I have not personally used, but she was delighted with the colors!  This particular seller shipped out quickly and I had it in plenty of time for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Nail polish bottles was really to small but I guess that&#x27;s my fault because I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size of the bottles.</li>

    <li> I like these nail polishes.I have started ordering. 18 so for. Wearing multi-colored caftans, this palette of nail polish provides...my&amp;#34;forever change in the moment&amp;#34; colors. The  bottles are not regular size but bigger than exspected and  fat.</li>

Overall though it is a fantastic value for a fantastic price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and you like to change your nail polish color often the early chipping won&#x27;t bother you anyway!</li>
    <li> I use these year around and get many compliments on my nails.  Love the colors, sparkles and they hold up well.</li>

    <li> Very happy with thsi collection. The colors shine and I am a huge fan of glitter polish. I only wish the bottles were bigger.</li>
    <li> The colors are brilliant, absolutely gorgeous. You&#x27;ll only need one coat not 2. The polish dries quickly and it was cheap&#x27; now for the bad: the smell lingers for HOURS...my sense of smell is not all that great but even I couldn&#x27;t stand having my hand close to my nose (chest level). The bottle are small but for the price I expected that.</li>
    <li> My Granddaughters loved this polish,I think they liked the sparkles</li>
    <li> nice packaging.  very disappointed that the blue and green are so thick that they are unusable.</li>
    <li> Beautigul colors. The polish lasts and lasts. I had it on for 2 weeks.. This is the 2nd or 3rd I have bought of this brand, I love it</li>
    <li> Bought these mini bottles of nail polish for my daughter and she really likes them.  The colors are vibrant and they stay on for a good length of time.  You need to do at least two to three coats.</li>
    <li> This was one of the only places I could actually find a real Christmas-y green color for my \\&quot;Holly\\&quot;-day nails. I&#x27;ve only used the gold, red, and green and didn&#x27;t fully paint any of my nails with the colors. But they worked fine for dotting to make little holly leaves and berries. The bottles are small, but I only need them once in a while for the odd kind of nail design, so I am happy with that. Something that I didn&#x27;t realize in the picture was that the red, green, and blue have glitter in them, but fine glitter not like the other 3 that have the chunky stuff.</li>
    <li> The colors are really cute but the green one turns my skin yellow (where ever it touches as well as underneath the finger nail).</li>
