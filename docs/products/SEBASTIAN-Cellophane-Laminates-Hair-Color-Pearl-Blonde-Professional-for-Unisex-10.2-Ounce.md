      <li>This product is a great in between salon visit product and really works great to fill in the holes in damaged hair to help at least until you can grow it out to cut off the damage.</li>
      <li>all right but perple instead of blond!</li>
      <li>But even after that, I knew I was going to lose the bottom 4-6 inches fairly soon because I could see it was beginning to split and break and not on the ends but mid shaft.</li>
      <li>hunt around Amazon for the best price for the Pearl Blonde and double up.  </li>
      <li>I tried the true brunette and the first time took it off after 10 mns thinking it would be too dark.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth, tangle free, silky, the yellow and brassiness is gone.</li>
      <li>so I thought I&#x27;d try a clear color product and searched until I found this product that I could do easily at home.</li>
      <li>I babied it for a month, no heat, very little combing, no blow drying and some very deep protein conditioners, Pureology Masque repair, which is awesome too BTW.</li>
      <li>My hair is hell to comb out even after combing awesome, expensive conditioner through it in the shower.</li>
      <li>I think the bottle may last for two more</li>
      <li>, it was so pretty.</li>
      <li>nice gloss.good for blond and other colors(its</li>
      <li>nice gloss.good for blond and other colors(its</li>
      <li>I like to use Sebastian Laminates Cellophane between hair coloring because is making my hair really shiny , soft and frizz free.</li>
      <li>They were good enough for the price here, cause in regular stores it sells for $30+</li>
      <li>Also, although I like the color, I don&#x27;t notice much additional shine from the product.</li>
      <li>My color is still light blonde but has some depth.</li>
      <li>I used this product as directed; I used a sulfate free shampoo, left on for 20 mins while using heat.</li>
      <li>Clear cellophane always sells out or is priced higher,</li>
      <li>WOW this stuff really work!</li>
      <li>Now I use the true brunette 2 ounces and one of honey blonde.</li>
      <li>Love the Senastian Lamnates, especially the pearl blonde color!</li>
      <li>The Honey Blonde was a bit orangey by itself, but a step in the right direction.  </li>
      <li>but I did not want to color over the newly lightened ends</li>
      <li>It was the perfect toner to get a cooler blonde on my highlights and get out the brassy tones but it made my hair feel like straw and tangle like crazy.</li>
      <li>I can say that my hair is completely revived!</li>
      <li>My hair came out like a professional had done it!</li>
      <li>Found this for $7.99 at the time of sale and thought WOW!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to use It to safely enhance my hair as I grow my natural dark blonde color out.</li>
      <li>This products gives a natural glow, lots of shine to my hair, so far I have use the bottle twice and love the gloss it gives my dull hair.</li>
      <li>From now on I will use Sebastian Clear Cellophanes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>just going to work like clear )</li>
      <li>I use this instead of the Clear</li>
      <li>just going to work like clear )</li>
      <li>Heat is one of the things that really makes the shine pop, and I guarantee you will receive the same compliments I do!</li>
      <li>I have to wait a few more days to use this product as I recently did a keratin treatment.  </li>
      <li>I went in for an ombre on very grown out, fairly long and babied hair.</li>
      <li>I have a very curly honey long hair, with a lot of frizz.</li>
      <li>As a woman of color with really curly hair that is fragile, I am always looking for things that make it stronger and healthier, especially the ends.  </li>
      <li>generally if you don&#x27;t have that problem.  </li>
      <li>However, the hair near my face is lighter, and this takes the brassiness out of the blonde.  </li>
      <li>I realized it barely changed my color.</li>
      <li>My stylist left the bleach on too long and my hair was pretty much spaghetti from the ears down.</li>

<li> if you have dark hair, the pearl blond will not affect the color, but the deposit of the cellophane will still make your hair glossy.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;m not sure why that</li>
<li> After sebastian cellophene, no more frizz, wich made my curls define also</li>
<li> I was shocked with the final result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The worst part was that I had just grown it out from a short inverted bob, which took 3 years.</li>
<li> Gave four stars since it smelled bad and chemically and irritated my eyes .</li>
<li> I was shocked thank</li>
<li> Disappointed. &#x3D;(</li>

    <li> Good price ,,....!! Thank you so much!!!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, blonde  and damaged hair. it works PERFECTLY for me! no yellow tint. shining effect. Thanks a lor for this incredible product!  I can rule my hair as I want due to this thing!</li>
    <li> I used this product as directed; I used a sulfate free shampoo, left on for 20 mins while using heat. This product did leave my hair with a slight blue/ashy tone that lasted through one shampoo. Did not notice any shine. Disappointed. &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I put this on my Moms hair it turned it purple!! I was shocked thank goodness it fades with every washing of her hair! Her hair has never been permed or colored her hair is white with silver highlights so I figured it would give her a nice blond shine..... Well it gave her shine all right but perple instead of blond! I am very, very disappointed in this product! That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 1 star it did give her shine!</li>
    <li> Found this for $7.99 at the time of sale and thought WOW! It does help to take away some of the brassiness in hair and add shine, although I wasn&#x27;t mesmerized by the results. They were good enough for the price here, cause in regular stores it sells for $30+</li>
    <li> It was the perfect toner to get a cooler blonde on my highlights and get out the brassy tones but it made my hair feel like straw and tangle like crazy.</li>
    <li> IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE HAIR,  AND IT MAKES SEE  YOUR HAIR HEALTHFULL.&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND THE PRODUCT  TO YOU..</li>
    <li> My reviews are MY experiences with a product.  Your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Cellophanes off and on for  about 13 years or so.  When I started going grey, I used the honey blond instead of regular hair dyes.  It covered my greys well and my hair was strong and shiny. I did that for about 5 years.  As time went by I noticed it made my overall hair color darker.  My hair is naturally a light to medium brown.  It was going black.  I&#x27;m not sure why that happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the last year, I&#x27;ve  started using semi perm hair dyes.  I use the Pearl Blonde one wash after coloring my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hunt around Amazon for the best price for the Pearl Blonde and double up.  I use this instead of the Clear which is more costly and for me, there is no difference.  It works well for me.  My hair is the color I want it to be and strong and shiny as well.</li>
    <li> I went in for an ombre on very grown out, fairly long and babied hair. My hair was healthy, silky and shiny. My stylist left the bleach on too long and my hair was pretty much spaghetti from the ears down. It had absolutely no shine, it was yellow blonde, which was very harsh against my natural ashy dirty blonde base and it looked pretty bad. I babied it for a month, no heat, very little combing, no blow drying and some very deep protein conditioners, Pureology Masque repair, which is awesome too BTW. But even after that, I knew I was going to lose the bottom 4-6 inches fairly soon because I could see it was beginning to split and break and not on the ends but mid shaft. Mid shaft breakage is the kiss of death for long hair, the only remedy is hacking it off. The worst part was that I had just grown it out from a short inverted bob, which took 3 years. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal but it was definitely a forehead smacking revelation, like why did I just do that to my hair, it was so pretty. All I wanted was to brighten up my ends and around my face. I know that coloring adds back in some structure but I did not want to color over the newly lightened ends so I thought I&#x27;d try a clear color product and searched until I found this product that I could do easily at home. It is very easy to use, this particular color does not stain, it is a bluing toner type, like the Brilliant Clairol toner shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can say that my hair is completely revived! It&#x27;s smooth, tangle free, silky, the yellow and brassiness is gone. I am loving this product! I feel like it&#x27;s healthy again. Even 3 days after my wash and blow out, my hair is not tangling and is still nice and fresh and shiny. This product is a great in between salon visit product and really works great to fill in the holes in damaged hair to help at least until you can grow it out to cut off the damage. I am so happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I like this product but its a little difficult to get the color just right. This is what I have learned for my gray hair. Pearl  Blonde has  no  color change, just a grayish tint. Did not like it. The Honey Blonde was a bit orangey by itself, but a step in the right direction.  I tried the true brunette and the first time took it off after 10 mns thinking it would be too dark.&lt;br /&gt;Then I realized it barely changed my color. Now I use the true brunette 2 ounces and one of honey blonde. My color is still light blonde but has some depth. I realized I no longer need peroxide.  My hair feels luxurious.</li>
    <li> ** TURNS GRAY HAIR PURPLE ** I have long hair. My hair is light/medium blonde and the sides and crown are white gray.  I was shocked with the final result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side all the rest of my hair turned out shinny and silky that is why I gave it 5 stars.  The product is good. BUT DON&#x27;T use Pearle Blonde on the solid parts of gray on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have blended gray hair all over it should turn lovely. From now on I will use Sebastian Clear Cellophanes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** UPDATE the purple came out when I rewashed my hair - VERY HAPPY</li>
    <li> Sebastian Laminates makes my hair beautiful and more vibrant. Sebastian does not disappoint and I would definitely recommend this product to a friend</li>
    <li> Clear cellophane always sells out or is priced higher, if you have dark hair, the pearl blond will not affect the color, but the deposit of the cellophane will still make your hair glossy.  However, the hair near my face is lighter, and this takes the brassiness out of the blonde.  As a woman of color with really curly hair that is fragile, I am always looking for things that make it stronger and healthier, especially the ends.  This does it.  Heat is one of the things that really makes the shine pop, and I guarantee you will receive the same compliments I do!</li>
    <li> Love Sebastian Cellophane always makes my hair shinier softer and healthier.  Been using it for over 4 years</li>
    <li> This products gives a natural glow, lots of shine to my hair, so far I have use the bottle twice and love the gloss it gives my dull hair. I think the bottle may last for two more application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product and the price love it even more!!!</li>
    <li> I have never rate any product on my life, put this i have to.  My hair has never been better since I decide to use this product. I bouthg it based on the reviews. I have a very curly honey long hair, with a lot of frizz. After sebastian cellophene, no more frizz, wich made my curls define also It toock away all the yellow color. I&#x27;m so happy....</li>

    <li> It works well. I remember a thicker product.great shine. My hair came out like a professional had done it! Brilliant!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to find a difference</li>
    <li> My hair is porous, so I couldn&#x27;t use the purple cellophane product, but the product is really great generally if you don&#x27;t have that problem.  Fast delivery and great seller.</li>

    <li> very nice product! work well, taking off yellow tone from hair. nice gloss.good for blond and other colors(its just going to work like clear )</li>
    <li> My hair gets yellow in between stylist appointments. This product is perfect for combatting that. It is easy to use, the purple doesn&#x27;t leave stains around my hairline (although my hands do get a bit stained). I did notice that I need to reduce the amount of styling product I use for several days after using Laminates otherwise it feels heavy and greasy. Also, although I like the color, I don&#x27;t notice much additional shine from the product.</li>
    <li> I like to use Sebastian Laminates Cellophane between hair coloring because is making my hair really shiny , soft and frizz free.</li>
    <li> WOW this stuff really work! My hair is hell to comb out even after combing awesome, expensive conditioner through it in the shower. But after the putting this on (and do not skip the proper heat time) you could run a fine tooth comb through my hair. My hair looks like silk. Excellent product.</li>
