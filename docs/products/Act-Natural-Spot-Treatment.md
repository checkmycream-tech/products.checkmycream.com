      <li>I think it works, but takes about more than two days</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Lovely smell.</li>
      <li>made her feel more confident about her appearance.</li>
      <li>I worked much better for me than the refining mask from proactive.</li>
      <li>The product seemed to work effectively and quickly to help minimize the appearance of her acne and break outs.</li>
      <li>We are happy that this acne treatment has all natural and organic ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Easy application.</li>
      <li>It fit in her purse, was easy to use.</li>
      <li>Ships quick!</li>
      <li>have already noticed improvement on the acne, which is a huge self esteem thing for teenagers.  </li>
      <li>A day before I ordered this I got a huge mountain sized pimple on my chin.</li>
      <li>So far so good .</li>
      <li>Original post:</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
      <li>Purchased because of all positive reviews and you should too!!</li>
      <li>I gave this Acne Spot treatment to my teen age daughter and she used it and loved it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to find something that works &amp; is still all natural.  </li>
      <li>Convenient size package and quick shipping.</li>
      <li>The little glass bottle is great.</li>
      <li>Worked well on first use.  </li>
      <li>I use it at first sign of any breakout and it clears up within a day.</li>
      <li>Overall I was pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I used this as a spot treatment for the one large pimple I had.</li>
      <li>I am actually able to apply this several times a day to clear stuff up real quick and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all.</li>
      <li>She seems to really like it</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>She has periodic breakouts, and this product has really helped stop the pimples in their tracks.  </li>
      <li>The product arrived within 2days with prime and was package very well.</li>
      <li>Item arrived as describe with fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t really take anything with Benzoic acid since it would make my skin prickly and break into a rash.</li>
      <li>Update --- after using for a few months:  This product works great for minor acne.</li>
      <li>I do not feel it is designed to be used as a product for full coverage acne treatment, such as a lotion would be.</li>
      <li>Will definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
      <li>I bought this product for my daughter who has mild acne, and she has been using it daily for about two weeks.  </li>
      <li>Larger ones are not treated as quickly but this does seem to reduce the size and redness.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>I have had a large cystic zit on my check that was very red and large for days.</li>
      <li>This stuff is almost all organic and in the winter my skin normally fights me by getting super dry anytime</li>
      <li>I think straight witch hazel would work just as well and costs $1 at the local drug store for a large bottle.</li>
      <li>She has also not had any new breakouts.  </li>
      <li>but in the first try it made it smaller.</li>
      <li>The key is to start using it at the first sign of acne.</li>
      <li>I wanted something that would not be hard on her skin, so the fact this is mostly organic appealed to me.</li>
      <li>Salicylic acid on the other hand makes me extremely dry and as a result makes my skin produce much more oil.</li>
      <li>I had this huge zyst on my chin &amp; this dried it overnight.</li>
      <li>In 3 days it was completely gone.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 11 year old daughter.</li>
      <li>This is a spot on treatment that contains all natural ingredients and it works to boot.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s seems to be working well for her needs and has not dried out her skin.</li>
      <li>I am always on the lookout for beauty items that contain all natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>and it shrank considerably.</li>
      <li>My forehead was back to normal and there wasn&#x27;t any stinging or peeling.</li>
      <li>Finally a product that works on my adult acne.</li>
      <li>He doesn&#x27;t have to be concerned about it stinging as this is an all natural product, and very simple for him to control where he is placing it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I am a 32 year old male with oily skin and get the occasional acne outbreak.</li>

<li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out</li>
<li> but it does dry out the acne.</li>
<li> Pimples were smaller and less noticeable.</li>
<li> I think this tube will last her a few months.</li>
<li> I really didn&#x27;t have high hopes since it was looking to be one heck of an ugly zit.</li>
<li> I just got this the other day and have been using this.  </li>
<li> She is just starting to get a small amount of acne on her forehead.</li>
<li> It was small enough to travel with her on school trips, etc.</li>
<li> They couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong because I hadn&#x27;t changed anything in as far as my eating habits and lifestyle other than joining a gym.</li>
<li> Helps some with acne but no better than any other product we have tried.</li>
<li> Acne treatment comes in a roll-on form, and he has used it everyday without any complaints.  </li>
<li> He is beginning to experience acne and with the few products I attempted to get him to try, he  complained of them stinging or burning, or just plain refused to use it based on smell or how it is applied</li>
<li> Not impressed with this product.  </li>
<li> My breakouts, while infrequent since my younger days, are still terrible when they do occur.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s ugly head</li>

    <li> I got this for my daughter to use. She seems to really like it and I believe it&#x27;s helping her for spot treatments. I would get this again for her.</li>
    <li> I just got this the other day and have been using this.  It seems to be working.</li>
    <li> This actually dies work! I had this huge zyst on my chin &amp; this dried it overnight. Happy customer!</li>

    <li> Simply amazing! Purchased because of all positive reviews and you should too!! Finally a product that works on my adult acne.</li>
    <li> This stuff is almost all organic and in the winter my skin normally fights me by getting super dry anytime I use an acne product, but not with this! I am actually able to apply this several times a day to clear stuff up real quick and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all. This along with a good face wash and moisturizer is all I need now for treating and preventing breakouts. Thank you to this company for making something that works for me and without all the chemicals too!</li>
    <li> Worked well on first use.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and just recently suffered from acne breakouts. I didn&#x27;t understand what was going on so I went to several dermatologists. They couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong because I hadn&#x27;t changed anything in as far as my eating habits and lifestyle other than joining a gym. They prescribed products containing the go to Benzoic/Salicylic acid. Couldn&#x27;t really take anything with Benzoic acid since it would make my skin prickly and break into a rash. Salicylic acid on the other hand makes me extremely dry and as a result makes my skin produce much more oil. After a year of on and off acne, I tried to find organic alternative treatments and read something about Witch Hazel so I decided to try a product that had it in the mix. I found this after buying some Bee Friendly products (which are amazing btw) and it works! Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out but it does dry out the acne. I tried it on a red patch that was about to rear it&#x27;s ugly head and it stopped in its tracks and went away in a day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not in the phase of life where I get a ton of blemishes so it took a bit before the opportunity to use this popped up (pun intended lol). I really didn&#x27;t have high hopes since it was looking to be one heck of an ugly zit. I dabbed some of this on for 2 days and it actually worked. My forehead was back to normal and there wasn&#x27;t any stinging or peeling. I&#x27;m sold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are 100% my own</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>

    <li> I have pimples here and there. it worked great for the one i just had. took 2 days to get rid of it but in the first try it made it smaller.</li>
    <li> I got this for our 13-year-old granddaughter.  She has periodic breakouts, and this product has really helped stop the pimples in their tracks.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to find something that works &amp; is still all natural.  This stuff is great.</li>
    <li> Lovely smell. Doesn&#x27;t burn or sting. Easy application.</li>
    <li> Why allow your kids (or you, for that matter) to use chemical laden products in order to treat acne? This is a spot on treatment that contains all natural ingredients and it works to boot. I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teen age daughter who has occasional outbreaks of acne. I wanted something that would not be hard on her skin, so the fact this is mostly organic appealed to me. My daughter took this acne treatment with her on an extended trip. It fit in her purse, was easy to use. It has a roll on applicator, it is transparent on your skin so you can use it anytime. She saw the difference overnight. Pimples were smaller and less noticeable. It has a great smell. So I am very pleased with the purchase made her feel more confident about her appearance. I think this tube will last her a few months. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Omg amazing! A day before I ordered this I got a huge mountain sized pimple on my chin. I requested overnight shipping and 3 days later the pimple is gone! Im sold thank you for this product</li>
    <li> Great spot treatment, worked overnight.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter who has mild acne, and she has been using it daily for about two weeks.  We are happy that this acne treatment has all natural and organic ingredients.  Although this product has not cleared up all her blemishes, they have been reduced in size and are not as red.  She has also not had any new breakouts.  We are happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Overall I was pleased with this product. I am always on the lookout for beauty items that contain all natural ingredients. I used this as a spot treatment for the one large pimple I had. I do not feel it is designed to be used as a product for full coverage acne treatment, such as a lotion would be. I did notice the pimple was smaller and much less red in about 48 hours. In 3 days it was completely gone. Please note that I did use this along with a name brand face was which contained salicylic acid. My breakouts, while infrequent since my younger days, are still terrible when they do occur.</li>
    <li> Great product! Ships quick!</li>
    <li> Convenient size package and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> So far so good . Love this stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> Item arrived as describe with fast delivery. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am a 32 year old male with oily skin and get the occasional acne outbreak. I have had a large cystic zit on my check that was very red and large for days. I applied this and over night the redness was gone and it shrank considerably. I worked much better for me than the refining mask from proactive. I also applied this to my nose which covered in blackheads, over night 70% had been cleared. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I think it works, but takes about more than two days</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 11 year old daughter. She is just starting to get a small amount of acne on her forehead. It&#x27;s gentle, easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent. It&#x27;s seems to be working well for her needs and has not dried out her skin. The product arrived within 2days with prime and was package very well. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my teenage son who has Asperger&#x27;s and Sensory Disorder.  He is beginning to experience acne and with the few products I attempted to get him to try, he  complained of them stinging or burning, or just plain refused to use it based on smell or how it is applied (wash/cream).&lt;br /&gt;This Acne treatment comes in a roll-on form, and he has used it everyday without any complaints.  He doesn&#x27;t have to be concerned about it stinging as this is an all natural product, and very simple for him to control where he is placing it.&lt;br /&gt;I have already noticed improvement on the acne, which is a huge self esteem thing for teenagers.  I already plan on ordering additional bottles and would definitely recommend if your teenager has any sensory issues.</li>
    <li> Neat product. The little glass bottle is great.</li>
