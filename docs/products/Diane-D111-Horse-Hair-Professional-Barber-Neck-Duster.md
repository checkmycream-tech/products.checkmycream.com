<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice size, soft bristles. Will be very nice to use after cutting my kids&#x27; hair. I&#x27;ve always wanted something like this</li>
    <li> Bristles are soft and length is perfect to whisk with. The handle is ergonomically friendly and further makes it a great duster. Simple but sweet!</li>
    <li> This is the right product adn delivery is always very fast. Great price too!</li>
    <li> I love the fact it dispenses powder when using,  however the knob to insert the powder and its twisting knob are very difficult to line up.  I am always afraid of stripping out the lid, which is basically the bottom base of the brush as you stand it upright.  The design team could have done better here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in the photo as advertised the hairs are white, somewhat remanesant of the natural hair brush my barber used to use.  However, I recieved a brush with black polyester strands of hair.  Workable, but the talcum despenses too quickly and it does not have the touch and feel of the old item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize money is important, but for this type item, my walet does not suffer.  I pay premium for what I want, and dont mind doing so.  I dream of a wooden handled, natural hair neck duster like my barber used to use.  Make a model like that, and I promise you will sell double the quantity of your existing plastic strands on plastic handle with plastic knob to hold the talcum in model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your price is fair.  I am not saying you over price.  I am simply saying men pay for quality in their bathroom needs.  Wood and Natural hairs model to offer next to your plastic on plastic.  Your price can quadruple (I am no cheapskate for quality) and your sales volume double.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dream of that, while I dream of a proper neck brush</li>
    <li> Just something to add to my clean-up when on the go. Will buy a much better &amp; fancy one for new customers but for now it&#x27;s just friends &amp; family hair cuts</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this neck duster.  When cutting hair, it is extremely important to make the person getting their hair cut comfortable.  This helps keep hair from sticking to the neck.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to give my 4 year old an idea of what it feels like to go to the barber.  Somehow I don&#x27;t think he will have to ever go to one.  He was so happy to feel the soft bristles and smell the powder that he kept still and i was able to do a much better job.</li>
    <li> Works just the way I had hoped for. Price was good and it has lasted me for some time now. Thanks for a good product.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Its convenient being able to load it with the powder rather than dump powder on yourself and then brush.</li>
    <li> Good quality, good price. goes through the powder so order some when you buy&lt;br /&gt;this duster. good good good good</li>
    <li> powder does not dispense properly.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the home haircuts I give my lad.</li>
    <li> The best of neck dusters!!!  Just like the ones barbers use.  Found this on Amazon at the GREATEST price, low shipping cost and you talk about fast shipping...this was FAST...whoooooosh!!! The greatest of customer service too!  Maya Beauty stayed in touch with me by email from the time my payment was received to the time the item shipped...to the time the neck duster arrived!  Too, the packaging was fantastic!  Very secure, well cushioned.  This was one of my best experiences purchasing an item online!  Thank you a million times over, Maya Beauty!!!</li>
    <li> Feels like another brush down from the babershop sometimes even though my barber does clean up after my haircut there are some hairs that are missed so that is the reason why i also bought it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with the gentlemen&#x27;s powder in the green container and it was a hit! I used this during and after giving my son a haircut.  It helped keep hair from going down his neck as I kept brushing it off.  Also, the powder left his neck feeling very soft . It distributed the power just right.  He said it felt so good to have his neck brushed, that he liked this and that it was just like at the salons.  Now, his haircuts will be more pleasurable!  I think it is so cool you can just unscrew the top and add powder. What a great idea!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a stylist and use these regularly. I clean them by soaking them in disenfectant once a month and they are holding up great.</li>
    <li> The bristles are too long--in fact they seem longer in proportion to the base than shown in the picture. This makes it less than ideal for its purpose, IMHO, but if I really needed to, I guess I could trim them or something. It&#x27;s nice having the talc dispenser. Ultimately, it&#x27;s a small expense &amp; not important enough a purchase to lose sleep over. It serves its purpose &amp; nothing more.</li>
    <li> It removes the hairs but it does so after passing it over like 3 or 4 times if i were to choose again i would get different one even if its  15 dollars, another thing is that the powder part of it isnt effective because it just stays in the cap it doesn&#x27;t really come out effectively enough.</li>
    <li> Unlike the (admittedly more expensive) bristle brushes, this duster tends to brush the back of your neck in one big clump instead of spreading around and covering a larger area.  It takes longer to dust off the neck and shoulders and you find yourself wiping the same area a lot to remove cut hair.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of the hair on the back of your neck after a trim or haircut and your clothes as well.</li>
    <li> Get&#x27;s a little out of hand even when the button isn&#x27;t pressed. I can live with it though.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to put powder on his neck. Summer time heat and collars have caused him a fair amount of chaffed skin, and this neck duster dispenses the right amount of powder without getting too much on.</li>
    <li> This is a mighty fine neck duster.  It&#x27;s top quality and actually feels good to use.  There is a pop-off top of the handle that reveals a small container to hold dusting powder to be dispensed into the brush with the push of a button.  I love this thing.  I&#x27;ve only used it once, but since I cut my own hair, I expect to use it for a long time to come.  Nice product and what I&#x27;ve come to expect from things I buy from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Good duster,  gets the job done.   Go easy on putting the powder in because it shoots out a lot.</li>
    <li> Not what&#x27;s pictured I got a regular wood handle brush and there was no button on it highly disappointed</li>
    <li> Amazing product it&#x27;s top of the line and does its job very well. Purchase it, you won&#x27;t regret it! ..</li>
    <li> Pretty good neck duster for the price. Good for dusting off excess hair after a haircut. I would recommend this to barbers!</li>
    <li> A definite plus in giving home trims to my husband, who likes the &#x27;soldier of fortune&#x27; close trim look.  Makes it much easier for this inexperienced barber to clear the trimmings and see what I&#x27;m doing up there, as well as an aesthetic pleasure for my man.</li>
    <li> I think this is good duster, but it is a little bit big and very soft, having it a little bit rougher would have make it perfect.</li>
    <li> This is not a good duster, the bristles are stiff, my kids say it feels like Im smacking them with the brush, the picture shows white bristles but the brush I received they were black. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the standard black plastic handle duster you can get online or at Sally&#x27;s.  It does the job.  Only negative would be the amount of powder released when you hit the button, it&#x27;s a bit generous.  Still worth buying.</li>
    <li> This is far better than any brush in a clipper kit and highly recommended, even for those that it their own hair. Delicate On the body and efficient. I have no complaints, although I do not fill it with powder so there may/may not be issues there for some there.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done nothin special, had it for a month and its still in good condition so overall good.</li>
    <li> The dispenser doesn&#x27;t really work for me, too light on talc dispensing. That being said it is a good brush and I just pour the talc into the bristles and use that way</li>
    <li> On time delivery. Quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DeFernandeze Hill</li>
    <li> The actual bristles were black in color instead of the white as pictured.  While it seems to be a minor issues, I am not a fan of a totally black powder duster.</li>
    <li> Very soft bristles for brushing the hair off of your little one&#x27;s face. I have not used the powder aspect of this, and do not plan to.</li>
    <li> Received wrong item, got a wooden handle, white bristles, and no spot for powder</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect! Just as described.</li>
    <li> I cut my sons&#x27; hair myself and have been looking for a reliable neck duster.  This duster works great and is soft enough for my young sons&#x27; necks.  It gets even the little hairs that are hard to remove.</li>
    <li> Within the first day of using it, one of the pieces fell out! Not bad for what I use it for, but it feels a bit cheap.</li>
    <li> My husband is mostly bald so I &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; his hair ... with clippers.  Anyway, Having the &amp;#34;duster&amp;#34; gives me a chance to polish my skills and feel like a pro.  It&#x27;s a fun touch.</li>
    <li> ITEM AS ADVERTISED. NO PROBLEM.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold much powder, it also shoots out the powder. Also, the knob cover doesn&#x27;t screw on as easily</li>
    <li> First, it doesn&#x27;t look like the picture. Second, it looks and feels cheap. Third, it&#x27;s hard getting the powder into the duster. Fourth, it&#x27;s even harder getting the powder OUT of the duster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s very low cost but I&#x27;d rather they gave them away free rather than charge anything for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away!</li>
    <li> It opens up and has a rubber button to send your fave talc into the bristles each press.&lt;br /&gt;Great for after shower or haircut, pre workday finishing touch.</li>
    <li> Not very well constructed. Screw on handle only has two treads to hold it on. Power does not distribute when you pugs button.</li>
    <li> it works very well glad i bought it. feels so good and professional. talc goes in ease and doesn&#x27;t go everywhere. push button control to release powder. stands up without laying on wet surface and preventing spillage. get one.</li>
    <li> Love it except no powder comes out wuld be nice</li>
    <li> The picture here is not what you get. It is all completely black. There is no white brushes. It is completely different.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the powder feature of this thing, only to clear hair from my face, neck, and shoulders when I cut my hair. It works great and is very comfortable. I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant shedding of the bristles. Overall, a very good product.</li>
    <li> lightweight and effective</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Strong enough to brush the neck hair off, but soft enough on the skin!</li>
    <li> This duster makes is very easy to apply powder, not to the neck, but anywhere on your body.  It has a push button, which helps to dispense the powder from inside the handle, into the base of the bristles.  The bristles are very soft and the handle has a screw on cover at the end and stores about 4 tablespoons of powder, or maybe a little more.  I fill my duster with Clubman Pinaud Talk, which you will find on Amazon too, and it has a nice manly fragrance to it.  I keep my duster next to my bathroom sink to use in the morning when getting dressed.</li>
    <li> Sure makes clean up a breeze after cutting my hubby hair. Gentle enough to use on his face and neck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional, but this powder neck duster worked perfect for me and my son love it&lt;br /&gt;vert cheap</li>
    <li> i like it. dont have much need for the powder portion. hard to clean if there is powder in it.</li>
    <li> This product stores powder, but does a poor job of evenly distributing is throughout the hairs which makes application difficult</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my duster. Many of my male clients complained about the hair that would fall on their back and necks. With the duster I can easily removed the fallen hair. The bristles could be shorter though, they are a little long for my taste.</li>
    <li> Great brush to use in order to clean off clientele great size easy to hold</li>
    <li> i ORDERED A WHITE I GOT A BLACK DUSTER THAT IS VERY SOFT SO ITS NOT DUSTING PROPERLY.  wASTE OF TIME</li>
    <li> I would not buy this again.  The bristles are fairly scratchy.  The brush does store powder, which is nice, but the cap is very difficult to screw in without cross threading.  It&#x27;s also difficult to get much purchase on the cap.  I would pay the money for a better brush next time around.</li>
    <li> I know that we have to reduce our spending to a maximun, I have decided to have my hair cut at home and This item is a very necessary tool, I find it perfect , it works well and I recomend it widely to all those that like to do their hair cut at home.</li>
    <li> Love this duster, put some powder in the handle and your good to go. got it for hair clippers I got at amazon. These two things payed for themselves in 3 months.</li>
    <li> I got this to help brush the hair off after cutting.  I would have liked to have found one with natural bristles for either job of brushing on powder or brushing off the loose hair.  But this does ok brushing it off.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok, just i got it all black color.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something with a similar feel to a make up brush, but this is limp. In my opinion, it would have been worth it to spend more money.</li>
    <li> Thought this was going to have a wood handle and hair bristles. The whole thing is plastic including the brush part. The powder in the handle is a nice feature. If your looking for a synthetic brush then you&#x27;ve found if you are looking for something more natural then look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful, the kids enjoy it while applying powder,  i hope it is always on the market because i would hate now not to have it</li>
    <li> Must have for anyone who cuts hair, has a powder dispenser built in and clean easily as the bristles are a very soft nylon polymer.</li>
    <li> I have a set of clippers at home and use this to brush off hair, on the clippers, neck, face, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Works great!</li>
    <li> This worked well to get the hair off the neck area.  The bristles are nylon so you have to be gentle when using it or it can be a bit abrasive on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This powder neck duster doesn&#x27;t work well.  The construction is poor and the bristles come bent somewhat to the side.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Hard to get the powder in the handle</li>
    <li> My only issue with this is that when you push the button to get some powder on the bristles, a handful comes out and gets everywhere. Way too much comes out at a time. Kinda defeats the purpose on what I needed to use it for.</li>
    <li> every one at the shop keeps asking where I got my duster.  I love it the hair doesn&#x27;t stick, it&#x27;s super easy to clean. surprisingly soft for the material it&#x27;s made of and easy to use</li>
    <li> I would not purchase this item again.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to go with a powder puff.&lt;br /&gt;I may be able to clean this brush up and try to use it for bar b que sauce on ribs.</li>
    <li> Good beginner neck duster for any beginning barber/stylist or for the family barber.  Highly recommend this duster for use with Clubman talc powder as well.</li>
    <li> top notch products, always great prices to compare&amp;#62; will recommend to every one! comes in handy after cutting and styling hair.</li>
    <li> I have only used this a few times. I only cut hair for my son and husband. This lets out a lot of powder at a time, it&#x27;s kinda messy. The twist off base is a bit tricky to remove and get back on. Does not hold much powder inside, the cavity is quite small. Should be fine for my limited use, tho.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush when used for the intended purpose. It did not meet my use-purpose, but we have used the brush successfully for other needs.</li>
    <li> These are a great value, there aren&#x27;t many places where you can skimp out on cost, but these neck duster worked just fine.</li>
    <li> Love it, works great! i fill it up with powder and slap my buddies around with that nice old fashioned explosion like BAMMM!</li>
    <li> Bigger than I thought, but it turns out quite handy. I only used a couple of times and it worked well so far.</li>
    <li> Terrible powder just made a big mess</li>
    <li> As far as being a brush, it seems very good, which is the only reason I gave it three stars.  The drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It came in black, although the picture shows white bristles.  This means the powder won&#x27;t blend in as well, not to mention advertising one thing and providing another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The dispenser cover is worthless.  It was very hard to take off, and I have yet been able to put it back on.  The threads are very poorly made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m debating whether to return it.  I might not as I could just pour a little powder on the bristles (which is probably easier to control the amount that way, anyway).  And like I said, it seems like a good brush.  But don&#x27;t buy it if you want to use the dispenser part of it.</li>
    <li> the best in the world</li>
    <li> excellent seller just as promised</li>
    <li> My husband is military and to save on those weekly cuts, we got our own grooming set at home.  I just added this tool to our kit about a month ago and it has been awesome and well worth the small investment.  After using the clippers, I brush of his neck &amp; forehead to finish the job with a shave &amp; scissors for a professional looking weekly cut.  Before I was using paper towels to brush him off which was no wear near as effective.  I love this tool &amp; am happy we got it!</li>
    <li> Hehe...Really sort of a piece of junk.  Although I do like the size of the brush, the bristles are synthetic and won&#x27;t hold the powder well.  Therefore the pushbutton powder dispenser just dumps out a blob of powder.  Let&#x27;s just put it this way....try to be a little cheap and get what you deserve.  Oh, I do like the flat base to stand it up with as in the pic also.  I&#x27;ll pitch this junker and buy what I should have in the first place.  My stupidity.  Would not recommend this one though.  God Bless.&lt;br /&gt;PS:  came with another order (a bookshelf stereo and 3 bottles of talc).  The whole order had little packing in the box and everything was just sort of beating around inside.  The box for the stereo was smashed, obviously from Amazon and the rest of the stuff was loose from it&#x27;s packaging and dancing around in the box.  Nothing broke, but I can hardly believe it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done and cleans up the dead hair that is left over awesome product for people .</li>
    <li> love this gets all the hair off my neck when cutting hair</li>
    <li> Its great. I enjoy it every time i clean up a haircut</li>
    <li> Gets the just done.  I have a lot of head to cut and this helps me out a lot when it&#x27;s time do powder my clients hair. Worth the price</li>
    <li> this is a good neck duster brush. you cant really go wrong with a neck duster in the hair industry.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. I feel like a pro cutting my son&#x27;s hair lol. Much better than using a towel to brush off. Plus it distracted my son while I was  cutting his hair. A bit overpriced but not by a lot. There&#x27;s a button on the side that you can see in the picture of the product amazon uses, but for the life of me I have no idea what it&#x27;s propose is. If anyone knows please reply here and tell me.</li>
    <li> Awful, awful, awful.  Bristles feel like plastic and the powder literally POURS out of the center.  it went straight into the trash.</li>
    <li> Arrived in expected delivery date.  Great product.</li>
    <li> its a 4 star simply because i have yet to use the powder inside it but as a duster its a 5 star</li>
    <li> Use this on my boys during their haircuts and it keeps the &amp;#34;itches&amp;#34; away.  Like the built in powder dispenser, saves a lot of time.</li>
    <li> The last brush I had got broken this one is very sturdy and I&#x27;m very pleased with it, plus a comfortable fit</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with the gentlemen&#x27;s powder in the green container and it was a hit! This is a mighty fine neck duster. It&#x27;s top quality and actually feels good to use. There is a pop-off top of the handle that reveals a small container to hold dusting powder to be dispensed into the brush with the push of a button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When cutting hair, it is extremely important to make the person getting their hair cut comfortable. This helps keep hair from sticking to the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have limited use of my hands. It was almost impossible for me to unscrew the top to put in the powder. It was even more difficult for me to screw the top back onto the brush. This feature was the main reason for my purchase of this item.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to go with Clubman after shave talc and it is just like being in the barber shop. He likes that you can fill this and it dusts out nicely!</li>
    <li> We love these black neck dusters. We were happy when they were available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Use when necessary during hair cut days,It is OK</li>
    <li> My wife uses this for family haircuts. The bristles are cheap and some fallout when used. Overall I am just OK with this purchase. It gets the job done but will not last.</li>
    <li> Great Duster!  These are not only great for hair cutting but also dusting around the house.  I would recommend this duster.</li>
    <li> Decent product, I use this with talc powder whenever I buzz my head, reminds me when I was a kid at the barber shop.  Easy to use, simply remove the cap and fill with talc.  Push button to release more powder as needed.</li>
    <li> this id a nice item to nave in your hair cutting salon but i found out it is not legal to use because of germs u add power to it in the handle and brush it on good for home personal use nice stuff</li>
    <li> Wrong product was delievered</li>
    <li> Before your customer get out of the chair, there is just one thing you have to do before they go. Dust them off and clear the excess hair. This duster, combined with a little baby powder does a great job at doing exactly that. Can&#x27;t be more happy with this product.</li>
    <li> this is the perfect tool to clean up all the hair after the haircut. a great tool for barbers to end haircut with a hairfree customer.</li>
    <li> Best neck duster I have used. The end of the handle unscrews so you can fill it up with pownder.</li>
    <li> bristles are a bit stiff and tend to fall out after a while</li>
    <li> This is not a Rocket Science tool but I will say it&#x27;s excellent for hair removal off of a person. Excellent buy for me.</li>
    <li> You have to fill this item with powder, but that&#x27;s pretty difficult to do, as the hole is tiny and powder is hard to transfer from one container to another.  Then, when you manage to get a proper amount of powder into the handle, and you lose even more powder to the floor/sink, etc. -- you have to press a button to release some powder into the bristles so that you can dabble the neck (or whatever area).  When you press the button, way too much powder shoots out, so you&#x27;ve got powder all over the sink, the floor, your clothes, etc.  I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s probably a &amp;#34;copy cat&amp;#34; of a far better, old-fashioned, barbershop neck duster.  The problem with these &amp;#34;clone/copy cat&amp;#34; products is that they look like the real thing, but they don&#x27;t perform the real task!  Tsk, tsk!</li>
    <li> Difficult to open and powder doesn&#x27;t distribute through the bristles. But it&#x27;s ok as a duster.</li>
    <li> Best neck brush I have ever bought, great quality</li>
    <li> Husband was thrilled with the ease of using this product. Very good for the price. He&#x27;s very happy</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase</li>
    <li> its great ,and instead of white hair its all black not the same on photo ,recommend you to buy it</li>
    <li> its ok no direction came with it and was so hard to get the knob off the base to fill with powder i dont hate it but im not over joyed i broke one i have which worked far easyer to fill and use i should have gotten that  brand again this one looked like it but soon as i  opened the box could see  it was not plus the shiping was to much and  they stuffed it in with movies i orded what rocket scientist did that lol i will try to make the best of it and  look for a better one like i have and say adiose to this one soon as i find one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dusty roads&lt;br /&gt;t</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner and packaged well.  Didn&#x27;t use it well but appears to be made well.  Will give follow up when I use it.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller.</li>
    <li> the neck duster came in color black wich i loved! the bristles are soft and shiny but they fall off a little, but still totally recommend!</li>
    <li> Nice. Just wish the bristles were a but softer. Gets the job done, though.</li>
    <li> takes me back to the old days.  Now all I need is some of the powder they used.</li>
    <li> Son uses it as he lives in a big house and cuts all his friends hair.  Seems to work great with clubman talc</li>
    <li> Works nicely.  I haven&#x27;t used the powder function yet, but as a duster it&#x27;s very effective.  Lots of bristles and firm enough to get hair off without being too firm to where it hurts!</li>
    <li> Awesome tool. Very simple and easy to use. blah blah blahh blahh blahhh blahh what else can I say lol</li>
</ol>
