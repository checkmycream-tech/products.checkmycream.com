      <li>Absolutely the best cream.</li>

      <li>my skin is good for my age but a lot of products sit in fine lines and age me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on as a very light shade, and then the product adapts to your skin.</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad I took a chance and bought this product that was sent all the way from Korea.  </li>
      <li>It made my skin look more even without looking like makeup.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>

      <li>but after a few minutes it looks perfect.</li>
      <li>This cream works great with my skin, not only it protecting from breakouts, it also evens out my skin tone and the SPF is an added bonus.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s hard to find a perfect match.  </li>
      <li>I use this along with a good moisturizer and a dollop of Clinique Men&#x27;s Bronzer all mixed together and apply evenly on the face and neck.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THE FAST SHIPPING FROM SOUTH KOREA.  </li>
      <li>I have only good things to say.</li>
      <li>I would say its medium to full coverage.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery with a cute wrapping.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this exact product for 4 years and still think this is the best bb cream in the market so far even if I try on different bb cream samples every year.</li>
      <li>This particular BB cream is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I got lucky with this product.</li>
      <li>This product was not grey it looked so nice once applied.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin and it keeps my make up fresh for hours.</li>
      <li>and before I could spread it evenly it gets absorbed</li>
      <li>On top of it all, the price is a lot cheaper than other famous BB cream brands.</li>
      <li>I guess all the hype on Youtube was right.</li>
      <li>A nice plus for using BB cream: I&#x27;ve had no new breakouts!</li>
      <li>I will order this much more next time.  </li>
      <li>This is better than mineral-based foundations, which I do not find to work well with larger pores like mine.     </li>
      <li>have stopped using it and am trying to bring back my healthy skin with jojoba and grape seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I genuinely love this product and use it daily.</li>
      <li>This was my first BB Cream.</li>
      <li>I am definitely purchasing more.</li>
      <li>When you first put this BB cream on, your face may look whiter, but it will start to blend in with your skin tone.</li>
      <li>It took about a week to get the product, much quicker than it was stated!</li>
      <li>this product is a bit too dry for me, I like the golden one better.</li>
      <li>Unlike liquid foundations, it also doesn&#x27;t smear as much even if you start sweating during the hot summer days.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice coverage but doesn&#x27;t cause any dullness or heaviness often caused by average foundations.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for people who has light to neutral beige colored skin who wants a light/moderate coverage with a natural look.  </li>
      <li>I was a little nervous at first, because it looks very light when you first apply it.</li>
      <li>THE PRODUCT IS NICE A LITTLE THICKER BB CREAM</li>
      <li>I tried it and the cream blends very well with my skin tone.</li>
      <li>I really wasnt expecting too much from this product.</li>
      <li>I feel much lighter than using the foundation I used to put on during the day and seems like it does not irritate my pimples.  </li>
      <li>On the real product, the logo Hanskin should be between two lines.</li>
      <li>I know because I bought the real one from a legit store</li>
      <li>It arrived so fast.</li>
      <li>No streaking, no heavy paste look, just smooth skin, no heavy creases around eyes.</li>
      <li>There was another review saying that at first it looks like it&#x27;s going to be too white, and that&#x27;s true,</li>
      <li>This BB cream, unlike the Japanese brand I used to use, is not heavy and has just the right amount of light coverage that I need.  </li>
      <li>maybe it&#x27;s better for other people</li>
      <li>The color is ok for me if I go very minimal with the coverage and def need a generous dusting of the mac mineral dome powder over it to neutralize whitish shade(prob from the spf).</li>
      <li>I would love to see it come in dark shades.</li>
      <li>, I think this product will work very well for people with oily skin/ or live in humid climate( like Asia, where this product is produced).</li>
      <li>Although, it&#x27;s main purpose is to get rid of the blemishes and discoloration</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive skin, but this never caused any skin troubles.</li>
      <li>This product is a WOW for me.</li>
      <li>It blends well with my skin and looks natural.</li>
      <li>It looks completely natural, not matte but, thankfully no sparkle.</li>
      <li>could work with the shade, but it is very drying for me, especially after I take it off.</li>
      <li>It was hard for me to put it on as it dries very quickly on my skin</li>
      <li>Although the display picture is the real thing (I know because it looks exactly like the one I bought previously) what u get is not real at all.</li>
      <li>Tube lasts a long time and I don&#x27;t feel complete anymore unless I have this under my mineral makeup!</li>
      <li>I received the package and I was quite excited until I noticed that the bottle seemed half empty.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I took a chance and bought this product that was sent all the way from Korea.  I&#x27;d heard that their BB creams were very popular, but since I didn&#x27;t know which brand was good, I had to take a chance in buying the Hanskin brand.  This BB cream, unlike the Japanese brand I used to use, is not heavy and has just the right amount of light coverage that I need.  Unlike liquid foundations, it also doesn&#x27;t smear as much even if you start sweating during the hot summer days.  I highly recommend this product for people who has light to neutral beige colored skin who wants a light/moderate coverage with a natural look.  When you first put this BB cream on, your face may look whiter, but it will start to blend in with your skin tone. After I put this BB cream on, I then use a concealer to cover up some blemishes and then finish up with a face powder.    On top of it all, the price is a lot cheaper than other famous BB cream brands.</li>
    <li> I have rosea and have looked for something to truly cover it without a cakey look.  This also evens out skin tone and gives mt face a lighted effect not shiny.  This product is a WOW for me.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd purchase of this BB Cream and I love it. Tube lasts a long time and I don&#x27;t feel complete anymore unless I have this under my mineral makeup!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery with a cute wrapping. This cream enhances my skin tone. I will order this much more next time.  I recomend this item. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The product got here earlier than stated! I&#x27;m very happy! I tried it and the cream blends very well with my skin tone. Does not smell at all.</li>
    <li> This cream works great with my skin, not only it protecting from breakouts, it also evens out my skin tone and the SPF is an added bonus. However, the shipping is SLOW. I didn&#x27;t receive the cream till almost a month after I ordered.</li>
    <li> it amazing how sheer it look on my skin while it provides great coverage.  I feel much lighter than using the foundation I used to put on during the day and seems like it does not irritate my pimples.  Great product, I will never use foundation again, since I got this BB cream</li>
    <li> I really wasnt expecting too much from this product. I guess all the hype on Youtube was right. I really love this stuff. It covers a lot of imperfections. I would love to see it come in dark shades. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I have a very uneven complexion. However, there is a cure: Hanskin! I use this along with a good moisturizer and a dollop of Clinique Men&#x27;s Bronzer all mixed together and apply evenly on the face and neck. Voila- instant refresh.  It looks completely natural, not matte but, thankfully no sparkle. I genuinely love this product and use it daily.</li>
    <li> This product was not grey it looked so nice once applied. my skin is good for my age but a lot of products sit in fine lines and age me. Not this and did not break me out. I would say its medium to full coverage.</li>
    <li> I received the package and I was quite excited until I noticed that the bottle seemed half empty. Also, I thought it was a face cream not a liquid make up. Although, it&#x27;s main purpose is to get rid of the blemishes and discoloration I believe that it is too white for my skin color.</li>
    <li> This particular BB cream is fantastic! I was a little nervous at first, because it looks very light when you first apply it. However, it adapts to your skintone, and the result is a flawless finish that looks natural, smooth, and not caked-on like most foundations. It looks great in HD pictures, too.  This is better than mineral-based foundations, which I do not find to work well with larger pores like mine.     A nice plus for using BB cream: I&#x27;ve had no new breakouts! If you have some residual blemish scars, you may need to use a concealer pencil (try Shiseido&#x27;s #1 or #2 shade, wears well) for extra coverage. Also, this Hanskin BB cream is moisturizing, so it won&#x27;t dry you out.     For the price, just try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact product for 4 years and still think this is the best bb cream in the market so far even if I try on different bb cream samples every year. I have a very sensitive skin, but this never caused any skin troubles. Very nice coverage, and perfect for oily skins. Doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s dry either. It has a very nice smooth feel. I like this product over any foundation products too. It has a nice coverage but doesn&#x27;t cause any dullness or heaviness often caused by average foundations.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best cream. I use it under my makeup and it makes my skin look flawless. I have oily skin and this cream helps my makeup to stay on longer.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff!  Although it&#x27;s marketed as a BB Cream, it does SO MUCH MORE!  It&#x27;s the best Foundation /Concealer I have ever used.  And, when it settles into your skin, it looks like your not wearing makeup.  People assume that you have naturally perfect skin.</li>
    <li> I was quite skeptical, but this cream really worked.  I&#x27;m southeast asian with a medium, slightly olive tone complexion and I was afraid the cream would be too light.  It was perfect.  It made my skin look more even without looking like makeup.  It also gives a slight glow to the skin.  I&#x27;ve tried several expensive foundations with yellow undertones and none seem to work as well....makeup tends to make me look grey and it&#x27;s hard to find a perfect match.  I am definitely purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Because it  work great&lt;br /&gt;If it work I will like it&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to my friends and my family</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  It arrived so fast.</li>
    <li> It took about a week to get the product, much quicker than it was stated! It blends well with my skin and looks natural. I like it better than my foundation.</li>
    <li> This was shipped MUCH quicker than was stated (great surprise), and I absolutely love this product. There was another review saying that at first it looks like it&#x27;s going to be too white, and that&#x27;s true, but after a few minutes it looks perfect. My skin looks smoother, brighter and this product has caused no blemishes, which is something I&#x27;m prone to.</li>
    <li> this product is a bit too dry for me, I like the golden one better. but only for myself. maybe it&#x27;s better for other people</li>
    <li> THANK YOU !! I LOVE THE FAST SHIPPING FROM SOUTH KOREA.  THE PRODUCT IS NICE A LITTLE THICKER BB CREAM THEN I AM USE TOO. I JUST USE A LITTLE ON MY SKIN . I THEN PUT ON MY LAURA MERCIER SP?  OR JANE IREDALE . WITH BB CREAM I DONT EVEN NEED TO USE MY TINTED MOIST , I CAN SKIP THE TINTED MOIST ON MY SKIN WITH THE USE OF BB CREAMS. THANK YOU AGAIN SEOULGLAMOUR.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but I though it is imp to have this info out there for people with dry skin who are thinking about using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does give great oil control, if that is a concern for you and does minimize pores and give a primer effect.I did not use it long enough to comment on the whitening effect. My two gripes about this product is the shade and how dry it is for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on as a very light shade, and then the product adapts to your skin. It was hard for me to put it on as it dries very quickly on my skin and before I could spread it evenly it gets absorbed and I had to tug at my skin to spread it.I had to spread moisturizer over it to get it to blend more. I am an NC 44 in MAC and of Asian descent. The color is ok for me if I go very minimal with the coverage and def need a generous dusting of the mac mineral dome powder over it to neutralize whitish shade(prob from the spf). I don&#x27;t think this shade will work for darker people with red undertones as it has olive/yellow undertones, probably because it is made for Asians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could work with the shade, but it is very drying for me, especially after I take it off. My skin feels tight and itchy and started to look very dull because it is dried out in just two days of use. The areas on my face that usually gets dry(around mouth,nose) started looking gray and uneven. Even after cleansing and moisturising, I felt like the product left a noticeable unattractive whitish tinge. Don&#x27;t know if it is the whitening effect. I tried mixing my moisturizer with the product before applying it and it still dried me out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped using it and am trying to bring back my healthy skin with jojoba and grape seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I think this product will work very well for people with oily skin/ or live in humid climate( like Asia, where this product is produced). I am saving it to give it another try when I visit Asia, as I think it will work well there. It has great staying power, which is something that is a huge plus when you are sweating off your makeup every 5 minutes in the humid Asian climate.It gives great oil control and give light coverage for daily use. But def not for people with dry skin.</li>
    <li> the best. use it under make up or without make up and just some bronzer . it covers pores and imperfections like nothing ales i used</li>
    <li> This was my first BB Cream. I read other reviews and took a chance. I have only good things to say. No streaking, no heavy paste look, just smooth skin, no heavy creases around eyes.I notice when I use a make-up remover in the evenings before bed, very little color and stain is there. My skin absorbs the cream. I got lucky with this product. I hope it works for others. Remember our skin is different, none the same, results for me, may not work for you. I will be reordering. Now the market is flooded with these products. I chose something not from the drug store. It works.</li>
    <li> Best BB cream ever! It is long wearing and covers like a dream! I can actually put this on with a little powder and wear it instead of makeup. Great coverage and stays all day!</li>
    <li> This is the best BB cream I have ever used. I apply it under my make up. It covers all flaws and makes applying my makeup so easy. I have oily skin and it keeps my make up fresh for hours. I can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> To all u ladies out there please don&#x27;t buy this product! IT&#x27;S A FAKE! I know because I bought the real one from a legit store so I have this fake one I bought to compare it too. Although the display picture is the real thing (I know because it looks exactly like the one I bought previously) what u get is not real at all. It doesn&#x27;t look like the picture and the makeup itself is not good. So don&#x27;t spend ur money on this! I was so disappointed when I got this today:( it&#x27;s gonna be a definite RETURN!  I wanna take a pic to show u guys what I&#x27;m talking about but I&#x27;m doing this over my phone and idk how to add a pic. Anyways what you want to look for is on the box to determine if its fake. This fake one says \\&quot;anti-wrinkle\\&quot; in the front when it&#x27;s suppose to say \\&quot;wrinkle\\&quot; in the bullet point. On the real product, the logo Hanskin should be between two lines. One above and one below. The logo on the fake one just says Hanskin without the lines. Hope this review helps you determine if your product is fake or not.</li>
