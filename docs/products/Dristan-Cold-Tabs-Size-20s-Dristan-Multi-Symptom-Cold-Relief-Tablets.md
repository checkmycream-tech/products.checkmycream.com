      <li>Don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t sell it here in the stores any more.  </li>
      <li>According to my mother, this is the best product for colds especially for build up sinuses.</li>

      <li>Not the original two colored pills, yellow/white!</li>
      <li>I was able to get some sleep and enjoy the remainder of the tour.</li>
      <li>so glad it is still available.</li>
      <li>It was fine</li>
      <li>After researching for a bit, I found out the the original Dristan contained meth and was taken off store shelves but was still considered to be an over the counter product.  </li>
      <li>This is an old product but for me it works better than any of the newer nasal decongestants that are on the market!</li>
      <li>For cold relief, this is the best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be...not Bret Hart, who stinks.</li>
      <li>Years ago I used Original Dristan in this red box with great results, especially if used at the first sign of allergy symptoms.</li>
      <li>My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t bring more home.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t&#x27; find it at any stores for many years and now get it on the net.</li>
      <li>I had used Dristan many years ago and could not find it in our local stores.  </li>
      <li>I have tried all the new OTC remedies for my allergies as well as some tried and true ones recommended by my doctor.  </li>
      <li>I certainly will reorder.</li>
      <li>I was glad that I was able to order this via Amazon because Dristan Cold&#x27;s presence on shelves of CVS, Duane-Reade, RiteAid, etc., is becoming increasingly scarce.</li>
      <li>I am an asthmatic...battled it my whole life.  </li>
      <li>i order these for my neighbor and she swears that they work very well for her.  </li>
      <li>Worked really well for my Mother, she could not find it where she lived</li>
      <li>Much easier for me to order these online.</li>
      <li>fair deal except late delivery</li>
      <li>No cold remedy on the market helps and the Dr. generally ends up putting me on the steroid prednisone.  </li>
      <li>and I recommend it highly.  </li>
      <li>Great for getting on with your life when a little sinus or bronchial inflamation is getting you down.</li>
      <li>I doubt I&#x27;ll ever buy this again if other choices are available.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find this product locally, I like Dristan best of all for my cold and sinus.</li>
      <li>The only place I could find it was on Amazon, THANKS!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve had no trouble with it over the 40 years I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
      <li>he looks for his old reliable Dristan.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that it seems to work JUST as well.  </li>
      <li>Much of the description was in Chinese</li>
      <li>-it&#x27;s the only  thing I&#x27;ve found that gets rid of a headache fast.</li>
      <li>They are not nearly as effective as they were in their original formula, but they certainly worked for what I needed with my sinuses.  </li>
      <li>It works great for those times when you absolutely must get the job done and not look like you are sick.  </li>
      <li>I did have a few boxes crushed, but the produt was ok.</li>
      <li>Took longer than expected, but it did clear my congestion.</li>

<li> have tried many different brands of cold pills and in my opinion&lt;br</li>
<li> This works better when my husband gets a cold or congested in his chest.</li>
<li> I have been using this cold tablet for many years</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t understand why it isn&#x27;t stocked, but I&#x27;ll continue to order it from these people as long as they carry it.</li>
<li> Wouldn&#x27;t you rather use your sick days for vacation or the latest videogame release?  </li>
<li> during allergy season but other than K-Mart who seems to run out quite a bit,  Haven&#x27;t found anyone else who sells it in the Baltimore area.  </li>
<li> I came down with a sinus infection.  </li>
<li> I first feel a cold coming on</li>
<li> If you begin taking it when your first symptoms appear,  I have found it will stop your cold within a couple of days.</li>
<li> We have been using Dristan cold tablets for many years but   now are unable to find them in any of the stores here  </li>
<li> Now when I get a cold, I know it will not be as severe and will only last a matter of days instead of weeks.</li>
<li> I received it in a few days and my headache is now gone.  </li>
<li> No more infected sinuses since.</li>
<li> After all, no one wants a sick person around work either.</li>
<li> hard to find so now have to order on internet</li>
<li> the company they use sucks.</li>
<li> The only porduct that surpresses the serious cold effects is this Dristan product.</li>
<li> I wish they still sold these down here in South Florida, but as I was unable to find any pharmacy or store that did, I ordered them from Amazon.  </li>
<li> It is difficult to find.</li>
<li> I do not know what is wrong with this world when they take the products out that work so well.</li>
<li> Regardless, I ordered Dristan but was skeptical that it would work as well since it was reformulated.  </li>
<li> and it made an immediate difference in my cold AND asthma symptoms.  </li>
<li> I get a cold again.</li>
<li> a couple of hours my cold symptoms are gone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never used this, but I have a friend who swears by it for relieving cold and congestion symptoms and no one can match the price on Amazon that I have seen.</li>
<li> Any time my husband has a cold or feels one coming on</li>
<li> I use Dristan whenever I have a cold.</li>
<li> I will continue to use this product as my #1 cold remedy combined with Zinc cough drops and Airborne tabs to boost my Vit. C.  </li>
<li> When cold season hits, my lungs close up</li>
<li> Hard to find anymore in drug stores (we all know why, those stupid people who misuse it!)  </li>
<li> Once in a while I get a really bad cold.</li>
<li> Drixoral is now gone and Dristan is almost impossible to find.</li>
<li> Dristan will do the trick of dampening your cold symptoms without the nasty side effects to hamper your work or commute.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve never used this, but I have a friend who swears by it for relieving cold and congestion symptoms and no one can match the price on Amazon that I have seen.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Only thng that works for my sinus headaches. Would highly&lt;br /&gt;recommend it to family and friends</li>
    <li> I was glad that I was able to order this via Amazon because Dristan Cold&#x27;s presence on shelves of CVS, Duane-Reade, RiteAid, etc., is becoming increasingly scarce.</li>
    <li> THE ONLY DECOGESTANT THAT WORKS FOR ME</li>
    <li> Nothing gets rid of a sinus headache as well as this does.</li>
    <li> I am an asthmatic...battled it my whole life.  When cold season hits, my lungs close up and I wheeze like 60 year smoker.  No cold remedy on the market helps and the Dr. generally ends up putting me on the steroid prednisone.  Last year I ran across an ancient box of Dristan (out of date) and I remembered my mother using it when I was a child.  I used it despite it being out of date and it made an immediate difference in my cold AND asthma symptoms.  I immediately tried to purchase more...but it was off store shelves.  After researching for a bit, I found out the the original Dristan contained meth and was taken off store shelves but was still considered to be an over the counter product.  You just had to ask the Pharmacist to order it for you.  I immediately went to Walmart and ordered it, HOWEVER, I learned that the product had recently been reformulated.  Maybe to take the meth out so it can be marketed on store shelves again?  Regardless, I ordered Dristan but was skeptical that it would work as well since it was reformulated.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it seems to work JUST as well.  I will continue to use this product as my #1 cold remedy combined with Zinc cough drops and Airborne tabs to boost my Vit. C.  Now when I get a cold, I know it will not be as severe and will only last a matter of days instead of weeks.</li>
    <li> fair deal except late delivery</li>
    <li> I use Dristan whenever I have a cold. It works for me all the time. I&#x27;m so glad I can order this product through Amazon because no store sells it.</li>
    <li> Any time my husband has a cold or feels one coming on he looks for his old reliable Dristan. He swears by it, always has. The only place I could find it was on Amazon, THANKS!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to know I can still find DRISTAN TABLETS!!! Its the only sinus medication that works for me....and has worked for me for years!!    I cannot find it in the stores anymore...  This find on AMAZON.COM was just great!</li>
    <li> I have tried all the new OTC remedies for my allergies as well as some tried and true ones recommended by my doctor.  I keep returning to Dristan.  it works the best and I&#x27;ve had no trouble with it over the 40 years I&#x27;ve been using it.  I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the quitness of the delivey. I did have a few boxes crushed, but the produt was ok. the company they use sucks. it&#x27;s UPS and they just through it at my door. But I would use these people again. it not there fault UPS as employees who don&#x27;t know how lucky they are to have a job!!</li>
    <li> One by one either the government and/or the drug companies are making our most reliable over the counter drugs disappear. And for what reason? Drixoral is now gone and Dristan is almost impossible to find. Allergy and Sinus sufferers who have used these drugs to ease their symptoms are left to the misery of their afflictions. Dristan does help if you can find it. Thank God these folks still sell it!!</li>
    <li> I do not know what is wrong with this world when they take the products out that work so well.</li>
    <li> during allergy season but other than K-Mart who seems to run out quite a bit,  Haven&#x27;t found anyone else who sells it in the Baltimore area.  Much easier for me to order these online.</li>
    <li> This is an old product but for me it works better than any of the newer nasal decongestants that are on the market!</li>
    <li> I never thought I would see this product again.  My pharmacy told me they took it off the market and for  me it&#x27;s one of the only decongestants I can use.</li>
    <li> My husband wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  These tablets work for him and since the stores don&#x27;t carry them anymore was glad we get it online.</li>
    <li> This has been the very best medication I&#x27;ve ever taken over 40 years for relief from allergies and hay fever.  Don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t sell it here in the stores any more.  For me it even works better than the prescription stuff and it doesn&#x27;t cause any drowsiness.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> It was fine and I need to reorder.</li>
    <li> Who can afford to take time time off for sickness these days?  Wouldn&#x27;t you rather use your sick days for vacation or the latest videogame release?  Dristan will do the trick of dampening your cold symptoms without the nasty side effects to hamper your work or commute.  It works great for those times when you absolutely must get the job done and not look like you are sick.  After all, no one wants a sick person around work either. This product works great at letting you perform your tasks without looking under the weather.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS FOR YEARS.  STILL WORKS BEST FOR MULTIPLE SINUS PROBLEMS.</li>
    <li> We have been using Dristan cold tablets for many years but   now are unable to find them in any of the stores here  Was so happy to see Amazon carries them -it&#x27;s the only  thing I&#x27;ve found that gets rid of a headache fast.</li>
    <li> It seemed to help a bit, but I went back to using Mucinex liquid. I doubt I&#x27;ll ever buy this again if other choices are available.</li>
    <li> We were on a 3 week tour of China.  I came down with a sinus infection.  I finally took an antibiotic that I had packed from home.  The green mucus still persisted and my ears were hurting from flying so much.  I checked out a pharmacy in Hong Kong and recognized the red box on the shelf.  Much of the description was in Chinese but I was so happy to see it I purchased it immediately.  It worked just like it always did.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t bring more home.  Incidentally, I only had to take one pill instead of the recommended two.  Worked like a charm. I was able to get some sleep and enjoy the remainder of the tour.</li>
    <li> This must be only sold in the Mid-West.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a coupon for Kmart but our Kmarts did not have it.&lt;br /&gt;I found it here and am happy and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I had to look to find this; nobody locally has it in stock anymore.  It has always worked well for me, better than most of what is on the market.  Can&#x27;t understand why it isn&#x27;t stocked, but I&#x27;ll continue to order it from these people as long as they carry it.</li>
    <li> Best of best for Nasal and chest problems ,,,</li>
    <li> the only place left where you can get Dristan. it&#x27;s the only thing that works for me. like they say. the old ways are the best ways.</li>
    <li> Not the original two colored pills, yellow/white! Only white pills!</li>
    <li> I have used Dristan for over 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;When I first feel a cold coming on I take two Dristan.&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of hours my cold symptoms are gone.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different brands of cold pills and in my opinion&lt;br /&gt;Dristan are the best.</li>
    <li> Satisfied. I have used this before, but no one around here seems to sell it.  Had to search for it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet. I have it just in case I get a cold again. According to my mother, this is the best product for colds especially for build up sinuses.</li>
    <li> i order these for my neighbor and she swears that they work very well for her.  The local stores no longer carry this and she is very happy that i can get it for her.</li>
    <li> Once in a while I get a really bad cold. The only porduct that surpresses the serious cold effects is this Dristan product. Have been using it for many years. It is difficult to find. Amazon is probably your best source for this product.</li>
    <li> Took longer than expected, but it did clear my congestion.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this product locally, I like Dristan best of all for my cold and sinus.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cold tablet for many years and I recommend it highly.  If you begin taking it when your first symptoms appear,  I have found it will stop your cold within a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Worked really well for my Mother, she could not find it where she lived so I found it here. Great product</li>
    <li> I wish they still sold these down here in South Florida, but as I was unable to find any pharmacy or store that did, I ordered them from Amazon.  They are not nearly as effective as they were in their original formula, but they certainly worked for what I needed with my sinuses.  Best part, it did not make me sleepy and I was able to take it before going to work without worrying that I would nod off.</li>
    <li> hard to find so now have to order on internet but it is the only one that works for my allergy so glad it is still available.</li>
    <li> This works better when my husband gets a cold or congested in his chest. And seems like he gets this every winter.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
    <li> For cold relief, this is the best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be...not Bret Hart, who stinks.</li>
    <li> I had used Dristan many years ago and could not find it in our local stores.  This product is wonderful for sinus headaches.  Your service was excellent.  I received it in a few days and my headache is now gone.  I certainly will reorder.</li>
    <li> Hard to find anymore in drug stores (we all know why, those stupid people who misuse it!)  Have taken this for years for sinus problems.  No drowsyness, no rapid heart beat, no dryness of the mouth and eyes like newer sinus OTC medications.  Great for getting on with your life when a little sinus or bronchial inflamation is getting you down.</li>
    <li> Years ago I used Original Dristan in this red box with great results, especially if used at the first sign of allergy symptoms. I couldn&#x27;t&#x27; find it at any stores for many years and now get it on the net. No more infected sinuses since. Yeah! Works almost immediately and symptoms don&#x27;t come back till next year.</li>
