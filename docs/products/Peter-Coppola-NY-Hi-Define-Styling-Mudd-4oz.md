      <li>Sure glad everyone is happy with this product.</li>
      <li>it gives a nice lift to my hairstyle.</li>
      <li>I am no stylist and have worn my hair for years just wavy and kind of fluffed....</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>thank goodness I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I make sure this is one styling aid I never run out of.  </li>
      <li>and you think it is ok for it to look like there is mud on it....</li>
      <li>So glad Amazon carries this product.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>easy does it though &#x27;</li>
      <li>It is was easy to use.  </li>
      <li>If it gets hot, it kind of seperates into oil and grit.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair look full and stylish all day.</li>
      <li>great timing in sending this product, have been using it for years, great item ,  will no doubt be using it for years to come, providing I live that long.</li>
      <li>but I am still searching for the next great thing.</li>
      <li>I could no longer get it from my original source, so</li>
      <li>NOt that good for long hair</li>
      <li>Good replacement for my long time</li>
      <li>My hair is straight &amp; fine.</li>
      <li>While it is not the only product of this nature I use, I have always really, really liked it.  </li>
      <li>I am not crazy about the pepto bismol smell .. minty-ish..</li>
      <li>and it smells the same - kind of minty.  </li>
      <li>aside from that, I like this more than similar products because its easy on my scalp which is normally very sensitive.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find anything better for my short, very straight, precision cut hairstyle.</li>
      <li>Let me first say.....</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different styling products and nothing compares to this.</li>
      <li>I really like this mudd!</li>
      <li>Really like this product!</li>
      <li>I plan on ordering more of them in the future.</li>
      <li>Makes styling my short hair easy.  </li>
      <li>but it certainly could be me.  </li>
      <li>Works really well on hair with hold and shine.....</li>
      <li>and I really do like it  thanks</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t care for the scent this has...</li>
      <li>Now that it was time for a new jar, I had trouble locating it, so was thrilled to find it here.  </li>
      <li>A whole new world.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for over 5years and even take it to the hair salon with me , its a boon to those with thinning hair as it &#x27;puffs&#x27; the hair up and makes more out of less....</li>
      <li>Never stiff, but makes my hair oily and manageable, when it otherwise would be straight and flat.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So, just keep it in your home at a normal room-temperature at all</li>
      <li>I saw it on TV a few years ago and ordered it - I love it.  </li>
      <li>Not as good when my hair is wet, it loses texture and my hair poofs out too much..</li>
      <li>I first ordered this Peter Coppola styling mudd from QVC several years ago.  </li>
      <li>One noticeable difference is the color of this new product which is a beige color, as opposed to the two previous jars I had from QVC, which were a light cream color.  </li>
      <li>The ingredients on the old and new jars are exactly the same</li>
      <li>I use it right after I blow dry my hair,</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and was surprised to see it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Love this product; however the color is darker than what I&#x27;ve purchased before and the texture not as thick.</li>
      <li>It is not as long lasting or firm as my old Sebastian molding mud (discontinued!!), but it is ok.</li>
</ol>

<li> It lasts a long time.</li>
<li> However, this jar lasts a long time!</li>
<li> I HOPE AMAZON CONTINUES TO CARRY THIS FOR A VERY LONG TIME.</li>
<li> When hair is dry I rub a dime size portion on my palms and rub into the hair.  </li>
<li> I think it is old stock came very dried out</li>
<li> YOU ONLY NEED A SMALL AMOUNT</li>
<li> If it gets too hot or cold.</li>
<li> I rub a little on my fingers</li>
<li> a little dab&#x27;ll do ya&#x27;</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not sticky nor does it makes your hair feel heavy or oily.  </li>
<li> I use this product everyday</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair over processed and limp.</li>
<li> It gives me lots of body and texture without being heavy or stiff.</li>
<li> &amp; IT GIVES YOUR HAIR HEIGHT WITHOUT FEELING STIFF.</li>
<li> Getting cold makes it hard and grittier.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> ads shine and defines!  Used to find on qvc and then hsn was so glad to now find it here!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff, because it holds my hair the way I want it to. Never stiff, but makes my hair oily and manageable, when it otherwise would be straight and flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with this stuff is that it clumps up and those clumps need to be rubbed out before applying to my hair. Also the product is made worrse by changing temperatures. If it gets too hot or cold. Getting cold makes it hard and grittier. If it gets hot, it kind of seperates into oil and grit. So, just keep it in your home at a normal room-temperature at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But aside from that, I like this more than similar products because its easy on my scalp which is normally very sensitive.</li>
    <li> Let me first say.....I am no stylist and have worn my hair for years just wavy and kind of fluffed....WELL....I GOT A PERMANENT.  A whole new world.  I really didn&#x27;t care for the scent this has...but that goes away....my hairdresser is going to accept this as a gift....but it didn&#x27;t do it for me...but it certainly could be me.  If you want to spike your hair...and you think it is ok for it to look like there is mud on it....you&#x27;ll love it...!</li>
    <li> Love it. Been using it for several years. It lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this product; however the color is darker than what I&#x27;ve purchased before and the texture not as thick. Maybe it&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf too long?</li>
    <li> I think it is old stock came very dried out</li>
    <li> Not mudd but solid as a brick.  Could not use it</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 5years and even take it to the hair salon with me , its a boon to those with thinning hair as it &#x27;puffs&#x27; the hair up and makes more out of less....easy does it though &#x27;a little dab&#x27;ll do ya&#x27;</li>

    <li> I have very fine hair and it is the best. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair over processed and limp. Use ever day spray and go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, only one that meets my approval. Makes my hair look full and stylish all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a finishing product for 5+ years. I can&#x27;t find anything better for my short, very straight, precision cut hairstyle. It gives me lots of body and texture without being heavy or stiff. I could no longer get it from my original source, so thank goodness I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product.  It is was easy to use.  Not clumpy.  Great for shaping hair without looking like your using a ton of product. Wonderful price.  I took a chance on this product based on the reviews and I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> great timing in sending this product, have been using it for years, great item ,  will no doubt be using it for years to come, providing I live that long.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and was surprised to see it on Amazon.  I blow dry my hair first and then just work a little into my hands and work it into my hair.  it gives a nice lift to my hairstyle.</li>
    <li> If I run out of this product I panick!  Everyone loves my haircut.  Great haircut but not without the styling MUDD</li>
    <li> Ordered Peter Copola&#x27;s Styling Mudd through Amazon.  I like it a lot!  It&#x27;s not sticky nor does it makes your hair feel heavy or oily.  Try it -  you will like it a lot!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this some years ago on an online purchasing club and really liked it.  I use it right after I blow dry my hair, When hair is dry I rub a dime size portion on my palms and rub into the hair.  This gives some body and shine and tames, that fly away look, very nice!</li>
    <li> Really like this product! Good replacement for my long time Sebastian styling mud (must have been discontinued) it works just as well!</li>
    <li> Great supplement to Paul Sebastian Mud, better price. Works really well on hair with hold and shine.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Makes styling my short hair easy.  Just a dab on my fingers and work it into my hair.  I use this product everyday and I love it.  I make sure this is one styling aid I never run out of.  So glad Amazon carries this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this mudd! My hair is straight &amp; fine. If I want my hair to have body with a scrunchy look, I use this. After just reading the ingredients I gave this 4 stars because of the parabens &amp; fragrance. However, this jar lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> This helps separate my frizzy hair</li>
    <li> Sure glad everyone is happy with this product. I wouldn&#x27;t know, because I cannot bring myself to use a product that has been opened and used prior to shipping. Beware of seller pharmacee.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS &amp; SUDDENLY COULDN&#x27;T FIND IT ANYWHERE. I WAS VERY HAPPY TO FIND IT ON YOUR&lt;br /&gt;SITE. YOU ONLY NEED A SMALL AMOUNT &amp; IT GIVES YOUR HAIR HEIGHT WITHOUT FEELING STIFF. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS&lt;br /&gt;TO ANYONE &amp; HAVE. I HOPE AMAZON CONTINUES TO CARRY THIS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. PLUS YOU PRICE IS AMAZING</li>
    <li> great service, arrived on time, been using this product for quite a while and I really do like it  thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok...but not a substitute for Peter Coppola&#x27;s moose, which I can no longer find.</li>
    <li> my wife has used this product for a few years and really likes it</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have tried so many different styling products and nothing compares to this. Easy to use and great hold all day!</li>
    <li> I like the hold. It is not as long lasting or firm as my old Sebastian molding mud (discontinued!!), but it is ok. Not as good when my hair is wet, it loses texture and my hair poofs out too much..I am not crazy about the pepto bismol smell .. minty-ish..&lt;br /&gt;Not a good reason to not just use it up, but I am still searching for the next great thing.</li>
    <li> I first ordered this Peter Coppola styling mudd from QVC several years ago.  While it is not the only product of this nature I use, I have always really, really liked it.  I just prefer to alternate products on an almost daily basis.  Now that it was time for a new jar, I had trouble locating it, so was thrilled to find it here.  One noticeable difference is the color of this new product which is a beige color, as opposed to the two previous jars I had from QVC, which were a light cream color.  The ingredients on the old and new jars are exactly the same and it smells the same - kind of minty.  I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, but it seems to behave the same way as the old.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> NOt that good for long hair</li>
    <li> Does just what I wanted. These hair products are very good. I plan on ordering more of them in the future.</li>
