      <li>I hope she will love it!</li>
      <li>Is nice but the way they glue the ring is sideways..</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>I liked it a lot, it looks really nice on a hand and it doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
      <li>I kept the ring part because it was cute</li>
      <li>Really cute.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>The quality is ok.</li>
      <li>&amp; I received it very quickly.</li>
      <li>However, it is cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I purchased this bracelet &amp; ring combo for a teenaged granddaughter, because it&#x27;s so unique.</li>
      <li>Even if you want to make someone laugh, or buy for throw away jewelry, don&#x27;t!</li>
      <li>Received it very quickly but the bracelet part was huge and it broke the first time I wore it.</li>
      <li>This item was well worth what I paid for it.  </li>
      <li>Broke first time putting it on</li>
      <li>I bought another one of these in silver and they both lose their color after wear for about 20 minutes in hot weather</li>
      <li>The ring part broke off from the chain the first time I put it on</li>
      <li>This is very flimsy.  </li>
      <li>I bought this item as a joke for my grandmother, knowing it was going to be cheap since it was only $2.00.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s a cute &amp; inexpensive gift to give for no special reason, or to add to her Christmas gifts.</li>
      <li>This item is cute, but incredibly delicate; and takes am extremely long time to arrive</li>

<li> ring too small, bracelet too big.</li>
<li> The only thing that was bad , few of the little rings in the chain were not closed properly, so I had to fix it with pliers so that it wouldn&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
<li> Part of the bracelet was held together with a green goo...instead of soldered together.</li>
<li> I have small hands and it was even too small for my hands.</li>

    <li> I bought this item as a joke for my grandmother, knowing it was going to be cheap since it was only $2.00. When she received it, the chain was not connect to the already smashed ring, or the bracelet. Part of the bracelet was held together with a green goo...instead of soldered together. Even if you want to make someone laugh, or buy for throw away jewelry, don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> This item is cute, but incredibly delicate; and takes am extremely long time to arrive</li>

    <li> This is very flimsy.  I bought it for my daughter to wear to her senior Prom but the ring broke off before she even got the chain part hooked.</li>
