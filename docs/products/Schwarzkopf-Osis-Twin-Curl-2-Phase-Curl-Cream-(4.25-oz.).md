      <li>No buildup!have used a lot of products and this works the best by far!!</li>
      <li>Excellent product, leaves hair soft, voluminous, and shiny.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Had better luck with Osis&#x27;s Spray Wax.</li>
      <li>Then I tried a good few-quarters&#x27; worth.</li>
      <li>Love the way this product works with my curly hair.</li>
      <li>Light and effective</li>
      <li>I love the product itself - the cream is light, not heavy/greasy; the scent is light and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great for every day use, this is pretty much my go-to leave in conditioner.</li>
      <li>Fabulous product, quick on-time delivery.</li>
      <li>I had to turn right around and take another shower to get rid of the strong smell.  </li>
      <li>If you are sensitive to strong scents, I can strongly recommend steering clear of this.</li>
      <li>Both products made my hair look good for the first few hours.</li>
      <li>Great smelling product use very little!</li>
      <li>This really holds the hair in place.</li>
      <li>I miss Pureology&#x27;s Real Curl.</li>
      <li>Great price and a little goes a long way for my thick/wavy hair.</li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t using enough, because my hair got frizzy.</li>
      <li>I have light, wavy, dark hair and when I use curl cream, I&#x27;m going for the corkscrew--I want to tighten my curl and keep it throughout the day--as well as de-frizz.</li>
      <li>However the creamy part always runs out before the clear.</li>
      <li>No product build up and my hair stays curly and soft.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>WOW...</li>
      <li>Soft to the touch but brings out the curls.</li>
      <li>This product leaves my hair flat and straight, especially if used when damp.</li>
      <li>love the idea - 2 products in one single tube&lt;br /&gt;However, the execution on the idea is not effective - I&#x27;ve purchased 3 tubes of this product and every time, the cream runs out way before the gel.</li>
      <li>I typically don&#x27;t use higher end products as such, but was turned onto it by my stylist.  </li>

    <li> Love it. Hard to find. Soft to the touch but brings out the curls.</li>
    <li> WOW... I have amazing curls</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair flat and straight, especially if used when damp. Had better luck with Osis&#x27;s Spray Wax.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a long with the velvet curl cream, didn&#x27;t impress me. I have naturally curly hair. Just wanted to something to keep down the frizz. Both products made my hair look good for the first few hours. After that just looks blah</li>
    <li> Great smelling product use very little! This really holds the hair in place. You will need a defrizzer to go with it for wavy frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> This is not a strong hold product. My hair is wavy with frizz and this product did not have enough weight to tame the curls.  I would use it on dried curly hair only.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, leaves hair soft, voluminous, and shiny. Great for every day use, this is pretty much my go-to leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love it,  not sticky!! Love the price too!!</li>
    <li> I ran out of my curl cream, and a friend who wasn&#x27;t using this gave it to me to try. I have light, wavy, dark hair and when I use curl cream, I&#x27;m going for the corkscrew--I want to tighten my curl and keep it throughout the day--as well as de-frizz. At first I wasn&#x27;t using enough, because my hair got frizzy. Then I tried a good few-quarters&#x27; worth. It kept the frizz at bay for half the day, but my curl wasn&#x27;t holding. The scent kinda smells like a salon, but it&#x27;s not offensive. My former Moroccan Curl Cream no longer keeps the frizz away, so I&#x27;m moving on. Next I&#x27;ll try DevaCurl, which a kinky-curly-haired friend recommends.</li>
    <li> Love the way this product works with my curly hair. However the creamy part always runs out before the clear. Wish they would just mix the two and alleviate the problem!</li>
    <li> Gr8 product.....gr8 online value compared to salon price!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product. Who cares about the ability to see the two different things in the tube if it yields an unreliable, inconsistent proportion of cream to gel with each squeeze. I miss Pureology&#x27;s Real Curl.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Light and effective I use it almost every day. No product build up and my hair stays curly and soft. Cannot recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> Fabulous product, quick on-time delivery. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for curly hair.Helps keep the curl all day.No buildup!have used a lot of products and this works the best by far!!</li>
    <li> I love the product itself - the cream is light, not heavy/greasy; the scent is light and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I love the idea - 2 products in one single tube&lt;br /&gt;However, the execution on the idea is not effective - I&#x27;ve purchased 3 tubes of this product and every time, the cream runs out way before the gel.</li>
    <li> Only the creme is dispensing, not the gel</li>
    <li> I have NO idea how well this might have worked for my hair because 45 minutes after I put it in my hair I had to turn right around and take another shower to get rid of the strong smell.  Talk about migraine material.  If you are sensitive to strong scents, I can strongly recommend steering clear of this.</li>
    <li> I typically don&#x27;t use higher end products as such, but was turned onto it by my stylist.  Great price and a little goes a long way for my thick/wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already responded to this.</li>
