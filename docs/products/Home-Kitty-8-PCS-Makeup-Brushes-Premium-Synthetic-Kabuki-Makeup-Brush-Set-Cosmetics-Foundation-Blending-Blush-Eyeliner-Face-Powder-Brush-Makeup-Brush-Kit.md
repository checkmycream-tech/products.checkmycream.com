<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it smells so much of the plastic !!!</li>
    <li> its okay for the price, It can be a nice gift or take your trip</li>
    <li> Came in great shape, took a while to ship but given that it was from China and offered free shipping I was fine with that. Bristles are soft and the handles are decent quality. Very happy for the price I paid! Unfortunately did not turn me into a makeup expert.</li>
    <li> Mines came in late but I love it!</li>
    <li> Love these. They are so cute and adorable and perfect for a beginner in makeup!</li>
    <li> I really is what I expected</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! Especially for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes they are cute BUT the blush brush is kinda cheap (Well it was cheap lol) but I have a cheaper brush that picks up blush way better Idk....but the shadow blender worked great as Well as the others.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap bristles....they look more like paintbrushes........the case is plastic, it&#x27;s pretty, i like the way it wraps around, but it&#x27;s hard to fit the brushes into, they don&#x27;t slip in and out easily......all of them are flat......</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very nice brushes,&lt;br /&gt;only thing is that they didn&#x27;t come with the case</li>
    <li> It came a week early, there is no shedding so far and the pink makes it extra cute! exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Perfect,will but another set .great buy</li>
    <li> I have owned some more high-end brushes from Sephora, and I still think this set does the trick, especially for the money. It did take about a month to get here, but I think it&#x27;s worth it to have a variety of makeup brushes for such a cheap price.</li>
    <li> What a great deal for these beautiful makeup brushes!  I really love the case it comes in.  I love things that are organized!  No more fumbling around looking for the right brush.  Easy access.  I am going to purchase a couple more of these for stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love these but brushes broke within the first few days of use. They were a birthday present for my daughter and now they are in the trash:(</li>
    <li> I love the pink case and pink brushes. However, the biggest brush start to loose the hair only after two time use. I am disappointed about this. Other brushes are doing fine so far. .</li>
    <li> love the brushes. All around great product.</li>
    <li> The bag itself had a strong scent of cheap plastic when i got it, i might wash it and leave it out to see if that fixes the problem. The brushes are good. a lot softer than i thought theyd be. the metal on the brushes is pink instead of purple like it shows in the picture but i actually prefer the pink so that wasnt a problem for me personally. overall the brushes are amazing for what i paid and i think itd be a very cute gift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no makeup expert but these brushes work very well for me. I don&#x27;t use them often but they&#x27;ve held up well even with frequent traveling. The bag is very convenient.</li>
    <li> Weeks of waiting and still mo product</li>
    <li> I love these they are super soft and stay clean with the poach. None of the hair has come out and they are easy too clean.</li>
    <li> For the price loved them</li>
    <li> I thought the overall look of the product looked great. Little did I know that it was falling apart. When I first used it, the brushes were harsh on my skin and made me breakout. The strands of the brush were falling out every stroke I used. The eyelash brush also broke when I dropped it. These are not good at all!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to use them yet but they came in really really late. The brushes that I have used have been pretty good. And the price is great!</li>
    <li> Cute little set.  Looked nice in Easter basket.  Worth the $</li>
    <li> I love it .Affordable and amazing quality.</li>
    <li> Some of the handles  came apart the first time I used them.  The tips came off. The eyebrow brush fell off the handle and the bristles broke the first week. The bag it came in smelled awful.CHEAP!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are rally good for 4$. Thay did take 3 weeks to come but when I ordered them is said it would take a month. There cute and pink and look exactly like they do online. There are a lot of little brushes and only one big one but hey I can&#x27;t complain for 4$</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with these makeup brushes. The packaging and color of the brushes were cute but the actual quality of the brushes is poor, very poor. They have no grab to them so to speak, so it holds no product in them. I don&#x27;t even want to think about all the powder I wasted trying to get it on the brush. The only brush in this set that&#x27;s halfway decent is the eyebrow brush. The lip brush was demolished and barely did it&#x27;s job to begin with. I really don&#x27;t recommend getting these brushes it may seem like a good deal but the quality is sub par, to put it nicely. I wish I had returned them when I had the chance.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like these brushes. This is my second review after having them for a while. They are not falling apart and the case they were in was sent to me already torn. The brushes do not want to be cleaned. At all. No matter how hard I try they will not come clean. The bristles are so tight on the larger eyeshadow brush that more gets trapped inside it than on my eyes, but the metal holding the bristles in is loose and they are coming out of the handle. They also still smell of chemicals (as they did when I opened the box).</li>

    <li> this set was really inexpensive but the brushes look nice and the case is lovely. if you&#x27;re already putting your holiday shopping list together, keep this in mind as a great stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome! They&#x27;re not going to be the best quality but they work well for me. They&#x27;re really soft and work great when putting makeup on. I&#x27;m happy I got them. Totally worth the price. For the shipping, it took make 2-3 weeks to get here but was estimated a little over a month. It did smell a little funny when I got them, but they have been in a package for a while. The only thing I&#x27;m not a big fan of on my first try was the blush brush. It didn&#x27;t work the way I wanted it too but I had another one I used to help even it out. I think once I get used to the brush then I will have an easier time worming with it. Other than that, I love it!</li>
    <li> Soft brushes and nice quality. They did have a smell from the case they were in, it smelled like fresh plastic and cloth. I washed them in anti-bacterial soap and warm water. They dried perfectly and work perfectly. I love the case, it is a travel size and contains everything I need and use. I would recommend them to anyone who wants soft and gentle brushes. Beware though, order them a month in advance, it did take that to arrive, but for free shipping, quality and softness, I was pleased to wait the month long.</li>
    <li> On the small side but iv been very happy with them, especially for the price! Who doesn&#x27;t like pink.</li>
    <li> Been using these brushes since I&#x27;ve received them. Great find. Great price. Absolutely just love them. Hope others enjoy them too</li>
    <li> I like the set and the pouch it comes with its very cute although the set is sort of flimsy referring to the eyeshadow brush but all and all its ok</li>
    <li> This brushes are horrible when I try to blend my eyeshadow it didnt blend well ! The brushes are not fluffy ! Waste of money I recommend you to buy other brushes even though you are going to pay more ..</li>
    <li> Some of the hairs in one of my brushes were already loose when I received it. Other than that, I like em. Cute case tok</li>
    <li> Smells weird! but perfect and soft! Shipping ok!</li>
    <li> Loved!!! Great assortment, great price, and the brushes work great! They are just like my professional brushes, only cheaper!</li>
    <li> Brushes are soft and nice would recommend them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really cute I was just looking for something a little more sturdier.</li>
    <li> So cute everything&#x27;s included as shown. got it before expected delivery date, i haven&#x27;t opened my Brushes yet but it fits into my makeup bag w/o taking up a lot of space. Everybody i have showed this say they want one, so i&#x27;ll be back to order more and maybe one for myself.</li>
    <li> This is truly what you pay for the brushes do not pick up make up well. There all like 2 that truly that honestly work.</li>
    <li> Nice set. Arrived early. Would order again.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described!</li>
    <li> These are great brushes and I love the compact holder</li>
    <li> These brushes are so cute! I bought 4 for gifts this year for Christmas. They are soft and full and look to be well made. The bag is adorable and fits nicely in just about any purse.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, the bristles were stiff and I am not enough of a makeup expert to know what they all are suppose to be used for.</li>
    <li> Soft brushes, my sister loves them</li>
    <li> Super cute brushes perfect for traveling and very soft ... down side is the bristles started falling off with the first use</li>
    <li> Extremely soft!! And not mini but not big. They&#x27;re like adorable and feel amazing on your skin</li>
    <li> This product is cute, convenient, and the brushes are good quality not the kind that come off on your face. All of the brushes have a cute pink tip on them I love it! Fast shipping, great seller!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these on lots and lots of people, and they do the job quite well for eye makeup; however, i would get a different brush for face powders.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 8 piece kit, but they sent a 32 piece kit.  While normally this would be a plus, this was for my 4 year old daughter and the 32 piece one is HUGE and it kind of makes a mess when she takes all the brushes out.  That being said, she is a little obsessed with anything makeup related so of course she loves this, so I&#x27;m happy with it:)  Thankfully we don&#x27;t play with real makeup so the only mess is the array of brushes everywhere.</li>
    <li> the brushes are the size of a can of soda..a small 75cent can of soda..the picture is not really what you will recieve...sooooo disappointed..</li>
    <li> Did not receive the pink bag to keep the brushes in like the description said. But brushes are nice</li>
    <li> They are &#x27;pretty&#x27; but brush broke off of handle second day of use.</li>
    <li> Took long to come and when it did, there are no cases for the brushes</li>
    <li> Love the color, and everything is there like in picture....Just hate the brushes are falling out. But I guess that what you get for a low price. Overall i&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> These are great! Such a soft brush. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes but when I got them and used them the bristles started to fall out but on the other hand they are really smooth and work really well.</li>
    <li> OK so I picked these up when they were just a couple of bucks. And for the price, they&#x27;re not bad at all... but expect them to be $3 brushes, that&#x27;s all. For a child or someone just starting out with make up, these are probably perfect. For me, however... I gave them to my sister without a second thought.</li>
    <li> The brushes were fine but it didn&#x27;t come with a bag.</li>
    <li> They seem too cheap, they break. Don&#x27;t like them.</li>
    <li> Great brushes well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Pretty makeup brushes.  Got these for my daughter who just started wearing makeup.</li>
    <li> cheap set, brushes were falling apart</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive it , but there are some cons.  The case smells like plastic.  Also, the bristles fell out after some uses. The big fluffy brush was amazing. The price is right but I personally wouldn&#x27;t repurchase again. Also the handles were a little to short for me.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! What a nice set - and so many different sizes, I almost want to paint pictures with them ;)&lt;br /&gt;They appear to be very well made - I hope the recipient will love them - as I am giving these to a friend who loves makeup, whereas I hardly ever wear makeup.</li>
    <li> Brushes are lovely and pink case is compact.  Smell of chemicals very strong.  Hoping it weakens before holiday giving time!</li>
    <li> A super great item at an awesome price! I ordered 3 of these, one for myself, and 2 for gifts. One of the eyebrow brushes was broken...but the sets were so inexpensive, that it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! But!!! A few bristles on the big fluffy brush kept coming out a bit just not a lot. Its still good!</li>
    <li> very good deal for this price. The brushes are very soft and good quality.</li>
    <li> not the best brushes but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> love these cheap brushes</li>
    <li> bought for a gift.  it serve its purpose but there are very stiff for applying eyeshadow</li>
    <li> Its basic brushes.. the case is nice but i wish it wrapped up a little tighter, the flaps make it a tad bulky. but you can&#x27;t complain for the price! its good for travel!</li>
    <li> Reason for purchase: I was provided with a sample of this product and in return I&#x27;m offering up my honest feedback after testing and inspection. All statements and information in my reviews are comprised of my personal thoughts and opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really nice set of cosmetic brushes. After reading several other reviews I took all the brushes and sponges out and tugged on them to ensure that the fibers/hairs/sponges would stay in place. They did, they held up nicely and I didn&#x27;t have any of the fibers/hairs come out when I pulled on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pink faux leather traveling case is cute and appears durable. All the brushes fit in nicely and this is great for anyone, even the casual make-up wearer. This would make a nice as part of gift basket or to be used in a basket or theme tray raffle item.</li>
    <li> i got them a week earlier and they are soo cute! I gave it as a gift for x-mas to my mom and she loves it(:</li>
    <li> Every brush fell apart the first week. For but these.  The tips fall off and the little ones do nothing but did over</li>
    <li> The brushes worked very well for apply my make up daily, I love the soft feel of the brush and it applied my foundation very smoothly.  After use my make up looked very natural and wasn&#x27;t caked on anywhere on my face.</li>
    <li> Delivered much sooner than I expected. Very nice set</li>
    <li> Eventho Idk how to put make up I ordered this and I love the brushes its soft..thanks and also came in early than the estimated date posted.</li>
    <li> Makeup goies on smoother an easier</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing was the big brush smelled like pain thinner. Went away after airing out, but would defiantly buy again.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made, nice case</li>
    <li> Gift for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I really love it.brushes are so soft.</li>
    <li> Very good quality for the price!</li>
    <li> I personally bought this product and expected nothing but since it&#x27;s my first actual set i didn&#x27;t want to buy anything expensive. They look kinda cheap but for their price they are GREAT!! I mean they&#x27;re soft and they apply makeup really well. So if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality product and you really don&#x27;t care what it looks like i think this is perfect.</li>
    <li> Looks like a good product but it never arrived.</li>
    <li> I love the color of the brushes which is why I bought them- that, and the price. However, on the day of receiving, this kit, I tried twisting a few brushes by the metal part to see how well they are put together. The metal part attached to the brush came off. So, if you don&#x27;t mind picking up a bottle of super glue to get these to stay together, cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They apply makeup decently, but are not very flexible. You will need to pat/pack on your eye shadow with these brushes- not good for blending in the least. Another thing is some of the bristles on the powder/face brush looked as if they had been cut- also not cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they were cheap, you get what you pay for. Thankfully these are soft and really don&#x27;t shed a lot so there are a few upsides. I would not recommend now would I buy these again though. I would rather invest my money in better quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Love the soft,easy to use, brushes! I would recomend  these brushes to you!</li>
    <li> This brush set may not be ideal for most makeup users, but it definitely has it&#x27;s uses. The largest shadow brush is great with picking up color and also packing it. It also impressed me with it&#x27;s detail abilities. I decided to change my lid color after my eyes were completely done. Using the tip of this brush gave me no problems in making that correction. No one could tell at all. I don&#x27;t think I will use the powder brush for anything but blush. It&#x27;s a little too flimsy for my taste. Other than that. The brushes are okay. But overall I would recommend this as brush set for a teenager or someone just getting started with makeup.</li>
    <li> Love the organization</li>
    <li> After maybe a year these start to wear down. They&#x27;re soft, but didn&#x27;t pick up a lot of product</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes are good, some are just ok, and a few are total rip offs.</li>
    <li> Love the different styles it has and the convinent of travel bag it comes with.</li>
    <li> Product is great. The handle seem strong and sturdy, and the brushes are nice and soft to the touch. Great as a Christmas present. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great very easy and comfortable.</li>
    <li> I got the brushes 2 days before the estimated delivery date, which was great!&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are really cute, the color is girly exactly as shown in the picture ...&lt;br /&gt;Quality is not good, but for less than 10 bucks you can&#x27;t expect awesome quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Very cute case and every brush I need</li>
    <li> I love these brushes they did take about three weeks to come but they came earlier then there expected arrival. There so easy to use and soft of the face such a great but definitely will buy more products from this seller.</li>
    <li> Poor material. Not a good quality I guess you got what you pay for !</li>
    <li> All my girls loved this</li>
    <li> Cute, cute, cute! This is a cute pink set that you will absolutely fall in love with, It&#x27;s compact and a must for traveling. It&#x27;s suitable for teenagers or a grown woman. The 8 brushes handles are durable and they fit securely in the pouch. The brush material is soft against the skin with no scratchy feeling. I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding either. I haven&#x27;t tried cleaning them yet, so I&#x27;m hoping they still hold up afterwards. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased honest review.</li>
    <li> I love these and the price was too good when it comes back I am ordering more! I love the colors, I am waiting for it  to come back in stock :-)</li>
    <li> The case is really cute. Pink is my favorite color, However I had a problem with a few things and I didn&#x27;t even use them yet. First 2 brushes were different colors (they had pink handles and not purple). One brush looked old and used..and then about 2 of them fe1l apart and I had to glue them back together. Right now it&#x27;s just sitting on my desk. I will probably use them, they do feel soft but..they need to LOOK at the brushes before they start shipping them off.</li>
    <li> These brushes seem like they hold up pretty nice considering I&#x27;ve used them quite a bit already. My only complaint is that they need a little breaking in. They aren&#x27;t at the point where they pick up a lot of color like my previous brushes did. But, when I get enough color on them they put the colors on beautifully.</li>
    <li> Exactly what My daughter wanted.</li>
    <li> bristles are too soft for proper application</li>
    <li> Not bad considering the price. The bristles are really soft, but these brushes do shed quite a bit. I love the color -- very pretty and girly. They are smaller (travel sized) brushes and the case is very cute. I think they&#x27;d be nice for someone just starting out with makeup, maybe, but there are a number of products priced similarly on Amazon that are higher quality, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This arrived quicker than the delivery window. It was packaged very carefully. Each brush was also contained in its own plastic for me to open. The brushes are nice quality and are very soft and held their shape well in the packaging. The entire package is much prettier and higher quality than I expected for the price. It did arrive with a funny smell but that dissipated so quickly, it&#x27;s barely worth mentioning.  This is a super nice set for either yourself or as a gift. I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes. They stink a little bit, especially right after I opened them up from the packaging. It goes away after a while and after you clean them before you use them, which I recommend be done. But awesome for the price</li>
    <li> I purchased this with the intention of using it as a travel brush holder.  I really like the small angled brush that came with the set, as it is perfect for doing small details with makeup, and it&#x27;s the best for eyebrow makeup!  However, the problem that I have with this set is that it is kind of small.  I had hoped to be able to store some of my other brushes in this roll-up so that I could safely transport my brushes when traveling.  It is not compatible with other brushes unless they are the same size as the ones that come with this kit, or smaller.  If you are seeking to purchase a makeup brush roll that will also work for your brushes that you may already have on hand, be sure to check the dimensions of the brushes you currently own before purchasing this one.  I feel like I would have been better off purchasing an artist&#x27;s paintbrush roll for my makeup brushes than I was with this purchase.  Regardless, it is cute, compact and has a decent selection of generic brushes for someone who is new to using makeup brushes.  This would be perfect as a gift for someone who is just getting into using makeup.</li>
    <li> It was an okay product..</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re definitely not high end brushes, but they&#x27;re great for a beginner or someone who doesn&#x27;t mind inexpensive brushes. They&#x27;re cute, soft, and they get the job done. I don&#x27;t have any complaints about this product.</li>
    <li> OK, but needs some glue on the handles. The brushes are very soft though, I like them.</li>
    <li> Cheap super bad quality the price says it all 😧</li>
    <li> Although the brushes are synthetic, I they are really stiff which is great for when I apply my eyeshadow.I liked the case as well. Very pink!</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 sets because I wanted them for Christmas since they looked cute and needed new brushes. I ordered them in November and is about to be February and I haven&#x27;t received them. I was looking forward to this but never again am I buying this product.</li>
    <li> i got these brushes a few weeks ago but didn&#x27;t try them until this week. their so cute and soft but as i was using one and pressed on the brush the top came off. that was the only thing i didn&#x27;t like. overall cute brushes.</li>
    <li> This is my second review of this product.  When I first got the brushes I noted in my previous review that the bristles started falling out with the first use.  The company contacted me the next day and offered me a refund or a new set of brushes.  I found this very refreshing as most companies don&#x27;t go out of their way to contact someone who writes a mediocre review.  Will buy from them again!</li>
    <li> One brush broke when I pulled it out of case.not going to return I will glue it on.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love them, you pay for what you get. But they&#x27;re soft so it&#x27;s nice. Took over a month to ship though.</li>
    <li> Brushes are overall decent!</li>
    <li> Im really happy with my order</li>
    <li> Arrived on time but I received one of the brushes used :(.</li>
    <li> Fell apart quickly, 2 of them were broken when I opened the package!! Never again will I order this!!! UNHAPPY</li>
    <li> The bristles on the brushes started calling out after 1 use</li>
    <li> i love these brushes I would recommend them</li>
    <li> this kit brushes are super cute &amp; really affordable $$</li>
    <li> Little brushes, very soft.</li>
    <li> These are okay. I don&#x27;t think they are worth the money. The tips fall off easily. No biggie as you get what you paid for. I just wouldn&#x27;t buy these again is all.</li>
    <li> Great pieces. Covers all makeup styles</li>
    <li> This is a nice kit.  great price.</li>
    <li> This is such a great cosmetic make up brush kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with eight brushes in a pink lettered case that ties closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft , they are made of  soft hair and synthetic for the brushes .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; They are durable and easy to carry in your purse if needed for touch ups along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are designed to give you a flawless look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this package of FOONEE  8pcs. Professional  brush kit. I am saving this one for a gift, so I will be ordering one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy one for yourself, a friend as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came neatly packaged , and came on time as stated .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend buying the FOONEE  8pc. cosmetic Brush set. You will not regret it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a deep discount for inspection and testing for my own unbiased review.</li>
    <li> They are a very pretty set.  Was juat as described and looks just like picture.  I love my set. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love these brushes and use them everyday. At times there is minimal shedding up still love them. Shipping came in a little earlier than stated.</li>
    <li> bad bad bad quality and s***ty smell it is terrible smelling and i wouldnt reccommend at all very very bad</li>
    <li> This makeup brush set works great. The brushes are super soft and theres a good variety of tools to use</li>
    <li> i got them 2 weeks early which is good, but i honestly can&#x27;t help the smell of this product is it very cheaply made and the brushes are already falling out. but its good for the price but i wouldn&#x27;t recommed</li>
    <li> These brushes are nice and soft and everything, but mine broke really easy and I just didn&#x27;t like them that much. To me there more for kids or someone just learning how to use makeup.</li>
    <li> This is a horrid product, I got it on the first day and it didn&#x27;t work, it was broken. I tried every single suggestions that was left in the reviews, none of them worked. Do not buy this, I wish I could rate it one star, it sucks. None of the brushes had tops and they didn&#x27;t come in bags!</li>
    <li> Brushes are very cheaply made. Not what I expected but it&#x27;s very affordable so can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
    <li> Love it. Was a gift for my mother on mothers day and sh</li>
    <li> Nothing special, the case is cool, the pieces work great. Ok if your adding on to an additional gift; this is not primary gift worthy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my little sister for a starter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> These are not the best quality brushes. I gave them to my 9 year old daughter to play with because I didn&#x27;t feel confident in their ability after seeing them in person. Some were bent right out of the package. Very flimsy...</li>
    <li> Must have! I have been using for 6 mos! Great quality!</li>
    <li> So happy to have these they are adorable!</li>
    <li> it is a cute gift to give in this holiday season. the only thing i had problem is the shipping took way too long.</li>
    <li> This was an awesome cute little set and got it a month early so that was an awesome surprise for the price of this item I thought the brushes would fall apart easily but they&#x27;re holding up better than my cover girl brushes awesome product!</li>
    <li> Very cute set  at a great price. Received earlier than expected. Brushes are nice quality and love the little case too. Nice size for travel as well. Will purchase again from this vendor.</li>
    <li> the brushes are not high quality but really good for the price</li>
    <li> I had these brushes shipped to me, and they came way faster then they were supposed to, so that was a bonus. I use these brushes every day. The blush brush is extremely soft, and all of them pick up the color very well with minimum fall out. I would recommend these to anyone. The only &amp;#34;downside&amp;#34; is that the brushes do not keep their pink and white colors. They tend to become the color of your eye shadows.</li>
    <li> The Price Is Great and the brushes seem to be in very good quality and they are very pretty looking</li>
    <li> I love the color. they are very soft. they shed a little more then most brushes do. these are more like if you need make up brushes badly and your on a budget type of deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;XOXO Katie</li>
    <li> High quality brushes.  My preteen daughter loves these!  Note:  SHIPPING TOOK A LONG TIME.  Like, a month.  I wanted this for a stocking stuffer but it was more of a mid-January gift.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. I hardly ever do a bad review but just had to on these. Firstly they were almose 6 months getting to me and when I recieved them they were awful..the hairs of the brushes were all wacky and falling out. Dont order from this company</li>
    <li> Great set for price. Brushes are hard to get out of the case but besides that I really like them. Case is not great!</li>
    <li> These brushes are cute. They came in a cute pink croc case. They don&#x27;t pick up alot of makeup but what can you expect for only $.99 cents.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I had expected. I am very happy with it. Not expensive and good quality. It is a good deal.</li>
    <li> So the color and style of these brushes looked really tempting so I bought them and hoped the brushes would actually work well too...Truthfully, I was a little upset because the hairs didn&#x27;t really stay in the glue like they&#x27;re supposed to...I felt the hairs maybe started falling out a bit too fast... However, the bottom half stayed on nicely and I was still able to use them for my face, so I gave this product 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, They did take awhile to get to me but none the less they have not disappointed me since. I was told these are cheap and break easy but after using them several times . They still are holding up to the wear and tear of my use , which makes them wonderful brushes in my book. I cannot wait to expand on using them and finding more makeup tips. I would definitely recommend these , they are cheap and they work! who does not want to save money?</li>
    <li> i wanted these because they are PINk so cute. and the handles are like a pearl shiny color super cute not fancy but they wernt pricy so what do you expect. havent tried them yet but i like them haha</li>
    <li> Loved it, color great,,</li>
    <li> Good amount of nice makeup brushes for inexpensive. The product is as expected. I also like the cute pink kit the brushes came in.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes back a few months ago and they were my second brush set. I love them so much! They&#x27;re great quality for the price. The brushes are very soft and I don&#x27;t have any problems with them falling apart or shedding</li>
    <li> Honestly was beside myself. It took a while for it to get to me but it was worth the wait. Very happy about my product.</li>
    <li> If you REALLY don&#x27;t have 20-30 dollars to drop on a different brush set on Amazon then I guess these are okay... For awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They worked fine for 3 or so weeks. They are very soft (which makes them impossible to use with cream products). The eyes brushes are really the only thing I cared about. The coverall eye brush broke first. The metallic binding loosened and the glue disappeared. The hair starting coming out and when I try to apply any pressure to the brush, all the hairs go in super far making it impossible to use. I smashed the crap out of the metal to try to keep the hair more in place. It&#x27;s working. For now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brow/eyelash brush just completely broke in half. The metal and the wood came apart. The other two blending and precision eye brushes are also loosing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this whole set is almost unusable and I&#x27;m in the market for a new, better made brush set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR Fine for the price if you don&#x27;t use everyday and only for travel. Not good everyday brushes AT ALL.</li>
    <li> Lovely packaging and beautiful brushes but I rated it three not only for the strong smell that comes from the bag itself. But also because the powder/blush brush was shedding way to much. The 2nd brush came off it&#x27;s handle and another brush shed hair also but other than that i look forward to using them.</li>
    <li> Great for the price!!</li>
    <li> I love pink &amp; I love these brushes. They give a even coverage &amp; blend. Great price point.</li>
    <li> This is ideal for touch up use throughout the day.  Nice to carry in a purse.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 5yo granddaughter for her birthday and she loves it.  I also gave her a makeup kit with it and she started using it right away.  She&#x27;s a real girly-girl and loves playing with this.</li>
    <li> Took forever to receive cute brushes.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to feel how soft the bristles were and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it! I hope my niece likes it as it is her first makeup brush set.</li>
    <li> So lovely brushes, i use them every day.</li>
    <li> Cute pink brushes. Very soft. Bristles keep coming out though.</li>
    <li> The heads of the brushes are all loose so any pressure I have to try to shove them back on</li>
    <li> Adorable and I am writing the rest of this just to fill space ! I can&#x27;t wait to use them</li>
    <li> Loved them and gave 1 as a gift!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for cheap travel, on the go brushes these are it</li>
    <li> For the price i knew they wouldn&#x27;t be all that like other expensive brushes, but they were seriously waay too cheap. Made out of very poor material, and they werent even the same brushes shown in the pic. I dont use them at all...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m learning different makeup styles and applications. These have worked great for me.</li>
    <li> The brushes came apart from the wooden handle I glued them back but the comb had broken teeth that was very upsetting.</li>
    <li> I looooove this!! Received it today in the mail a week early :D :D the bristles on the big brush are super soft. The bristles on the other brushes are soft as well but thick and sturdy!! Wasnt a cheap material set at all idk what people are talking about. Definitely recommend this to anyone. Listen to me and go buy yourself a set! :) &lt;3 i cant wait to try them.</li>
    <li> Broke in 2 months, only used once.</li>
    <li> Took to long to come ,bt I like it</li>
    <li> These brushes were terrible. I am not mad because you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The product is great, but it took 2 months to get here. I had to email them and tell them I never got the set. So, they sent me out another one and I got it in 2 weeks.. then just the other day another one came in, but was in a poorly bad case. Don&#x27;t know which set was the one they officially sent me, but it took wayyy to long.</li>
    <li> I brought this item in May, and the brushes are small and also the brushes are soft to wear when you put make up on you have to add alot, it okay for like a teenager I guess I use them for my little girls slubber parties.</li>
    <li> Their good butttttt..... The purple metal part detached from the stick 😒</li>
    <li> The only brushes I use are the eyebrow one and the foam one because the others don&#x27;t work at all. This to over a month to ship. I got it because of the good price and if they were more than 5 bucks I would have returned them....</li>
    <li> its a pretty good set of brushes but its very small , more of a travel size set nevertheless there still great and super soft :)</li>
    <li> they are some cool brushes</li>
    <li> I super lovethis. It has different kinds of brush and helps me a lot in putting my make up especially my eye shadows. It works so good and i would definitely get another one for a gift.</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re just starting off with few or no makeup brushes, then this is a good buy to help you get started, considering the price is a little over $3. although these brushes are somewhat cheaply made, (the pink metallic brush tips come off really easily) they get the job done, so I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m pretty satisfied.</li>
    <li> Definitely a lot smaller than i expected. Waste of money..</li>
    <li> Came sooner than it said it looks just like the picture so far they seem good but haven&#x27;t used them yet really pretty though</li>
    <li> I am happy I took a chance on buy this. The shipping was free and the product was only $3-4 dollars. I did find a piece of black hair on the sponge brush though that looks like it came from a eyebrow or eyelash. Overall I find the brushes very nice for the price. The bag is cute also which I was surprised to find it was not as tacky as I imagined. The pouch is cute enough to be seen in public and you could replace them with other tools. This was well worth it. &#x3D;) I bought this because I wanted more eye shadow brushes because I like to play with my colors.</li>
    <li> These were very soft they were just as I expected them to be they get the job done.</li>
    <li> This is the best and cheapest makeup brushes I have ever found ! Usually it&#x27;s expensive to find a makeup bag with all the brushes u want , but this one it came out on the exact time and perfect and very cute color ! I would definitely recommend this !</li>
    <li> So they are cute &amp; soft &amp; ok for beginners , but the bristles do start coming off after the first wash &amp; a lot of them. I couldn&#x27;t really get much product with these brushes. You get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> the brushes are?cute, my daughter liked the design, but they get clumped. it was shipped within the time frame.</li>
    <li> I think its a really cute on the go kit its very small. for the price it works better ty.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love them, they came in just in time too. Extremely soft and I&#x27;m happy I bought it</li>
    <li> Really good brushes &amp; easily to wash.</li>
    <li> Great set with all the brushes that I need and a nice case worth the money.</li>
    <li> used the concealer brush for eyeshadows at a wedding because they were so small thank god it broke the day after and not during... Got use out of them but would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Eh, these brushes were alright. Not good quality, but durable.</li>
    <li> ordered  for a friend she likes them. I got what I expected for the price only thing I was disappointed in was the size of the blush brush a little small.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes especially for the price! I have just recently started experimenting more with makeup and noticed that I did not own the appropriate brushes that I needed to use some of the new products I wanted to try. I was looking for a set that had a good variety of brushes but also for a good price. This set was perfect for me. The brushes are a very nice quality and I have not have any issues with them at all. Definitely exceeded my expectations. I would recommend these brushes to other beginners like me that are just getting started since you get a variety of brushes to try out.</li>
    <li> Nice set. I bought a lot to give out as gifts</li>
    <li> Worst brushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Of course they were $3.01, exactly perfect for the amount. I ended up throwing them away because all of them fell apart and some were glued on crooked! I do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I choose this cute brush set because it&#x27;s perfect to go anywhere love it and it&#x27;s just great I will keep on buying it 😛</li>
    <li> Exelent .... I got faster then I thought... :)</li>
    <li> I have to receive the brushes. Perhaps you can check on this.</li>
    <li> I really like the brushes, Theyre cute, girly, and the brushes are decent quality.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend washing them properly a bit before use. There was a very strong \\&quot;plastic-like\\&quot; odor from either the folding case or the brushes. but just in case its the brushes.. wash them first.&lt;br /&gt;I love the wide variety of brushes, this covers the basic necessities of make up brushes.</li>
    <li> Is really nice I bought for my Lil sister. I love the colors but the brushes is to small for an adult</li>
    <li> Great brushes, definitely worth the price</li>
    <li> cheap brushes, didn&#x27;t care for them.</li>
    <li> They took forever to come. And when they finally came they stink. They don&#x27;t smell new. They have a very strong odor that Burns my nose. I don&#x27;t see myself using these brushes.</li>
    <li> Love these Brushes. Came within a week and I use them everyday. I love them and they look great. And fit in small bags. Which makes it easy to transport.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ve held up really well for me and I use them daily. No shedding. The angled brush is a little too soft to get the job done, but nothing terrible.</li>
    <li> Brushes are great. Just wished it labeld what each one is used for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taking forever  .... I will never purchase nothing from them any more I feel like they just stole my money this after almost a month</li>
    <li> This arrived in two weeks, which was a week and a half earlier than I expected. The brushes and case are a bit smaller than I anticipated but they are still good. The bristles are a bit plastic-y, but they work well enough- after all, you get what you pay for. I recommend this very much!</li>
    <li> This makeup brush set is wonderful!  The brushes are a good quality and the little case is just as expected!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the price! Amazing bushes</li>
    <li> brushes are good compare to its price...</li>
    <li> Up until this day I still use the brushes. I did not give it a 5 star because when I received the items I thought the brushes were going to be much thicker and hold my make up. Sometimes I have to use my fingers to put more color on my skin.</li>
    <li> Cute set and soft. But does not include both a cover-up brush and a blush brush.  There is only one brush in the set that is large enough for these, so you have to decide which you prefer to use it on.  I personally just went and bought another cover-up brush.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for expect I think I paid more when I bought mine, go figure. Great for teenagers or getting started.</li>
    <li> Half of these broke upon first use. They look nice for a matter of seconds, then fall apart immediately.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my sister. And she fell in love with how soft they felt on her gorgeous face. :) It was also extremely cheap lol :D&lt;br /&gt;The only problem would be the shipment  date. I purchashed mine on thanksgiving . It came until new years.</li>
    <li> This is a great set and for the price, can you really beat it? They are sturdy and soft! Very excited to see these arrive!</li>
    <li> I loved is everything i expected a little small but its ok i like it i also loved the color is exactly like it the picture</li>
    <li> i use several of these for drawing with graphite powder. they are really soft and brush smoothly; great for making gradients with graphite powder....as for make up..no idea if they are good for that</li>
    <li> Excellent craftsmanship! Worth the shipping. Pretty and pink! Very soft. Small and compact! Convenient carry case for on the go touch ups!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for cheap but useable quality brushes, here you go. Great for travel and cute style. I do recommend.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality brushes. Case is nice and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very soft and I really like the products, but they kind of smelt like paint when I got them. Also it took over a month and a half until they came.</li>
    <li> these brushes arent worth the trouble. they started falling apart within the first week. the actual brush and metal part came apart from the handle. not the mention the brushes shed immediately. the price is cheap and rightfully so. dont do it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It comes with everything , has fast shipping and a great seller to work with.</li>
    <li> This is set is a super deal with the markdown. Original price, not so much. The brushes are really nice quality and soft. Perfect for what I was looking for and a way better deal/quality than what I would get at my local CVS. The case is weird. I think it&#x27;s trying to be coach or something with the lettering except the letters don&#x27;t spell anything out- there&#x27;s just random letters all over the bag. Kind of hilarious. I didn&#x27;t really need a bag, I just wanted the brushes and because of the design I couldn&#x27;t use it for anything else so I just threw it out.</li>
    <li> Very soft just cleaning them are a bit problematic</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes. They work very well and I am impressed.</li>
    <li> They are little and they are cute. They fit in my purse and I love me</li>
    <li> Worth the money. Simple inexpensive make up brushes for learning.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it with my MAC make up. You would think these brushes cost a ton but they did not. Well made!</li>
    <li> excellent product and 100 % reliable</li>
    <li> these shed so much! i only got a few uses out of them.</li>
    <li> i personally recommend this if a person is just starting off in makeup. the brushes aren&#x27;t rough like most brushes, its soft and the packaging is just too cute. You can&#x27;t be the price! Will be purchasing more of these Pro brushes in the future! :)</li>
    <li> The quality of the brushes were cheap and the size was misleading.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend not buying this product. I was ultimately unsatisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> These brushes look awesome, pretty, and soft. I&#x27;ve read the reviews and I can&#x27;t wait for their arrival. Although, I bought them on 3/19/14 and the expected arrival date is 4/14/14. Which really sucks.</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are amazing!!! They are soft like a lucky rabbit foot!! They came in today march 26 &amp; they were suppose to arrive between april 2 -18 my wife loves them!!! Cheap price for a great product!!!</li>
    <li> Very good these are perfect for me I love pink and I love these makeup brushes they rock and are really cool</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome and very very soft totally recommend!!!!! They are very cheap and so worth what you pay for!!! I am thinking about buying another set!!!</li>
    <li> Took 2 months to receive the brushes. Then when the item finally arrived they were cheap and all the brissels were missing. I mean I guess I can&#x27;t say tok much since they were only 5 bucks</li>
    <li> Still have used it yet but i luv the convience n travel of it</li>
    <li> brushes are way too soft.</li>
    <li> i like the case but the brushes are very cheap will not stay on stick and puff balls just kind of ball up while using it would&#x27;nt buy again</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful!</li>
    <li> Decent cheap brush set. It works well for a travel set but I would not use them for daily use.</li>
    <li> For the price of these brushes I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but they are great quality, these are some of the softest brushes I have felt, don&#x27;t pass these up.</li>
    <li> They are so cute and just pretty and girly. I love how they look but that&#x27;s about it. The brushes are TERRIBLE, but hey you get what you pay for and in this case it&#x27;s cheap. They brushes fall of the stick so easily. The glue and wood is cracked and old. The bristles are soft but they do not pick up makeup or apply it at all. I do not recommend this product at all. Soend the few extra dollars and get a decent set of makeup brushes. I look at these as a toy for an 8 year old. You can&#x27;t realistically use these.</li>
    <li> my 13 y/o daughter always took of with my brushes so she had a visa gift card &amp; I made her buy her own.  as soon as she got them, she washed &amp; conditioned them &amp; she loves them....thanks for a great product!!!</li>
    <li> Really great travel set.</li>
    <li> Convenient to used. Love pink</li>
    <li> I love the brushes ,awesome thank you</li>
    <li> I think these brushes are very nice and soft they do have a smell when they come in but just put them in a open window for a day and it is gone I think it is the plastic case that you are smelling once that is gone the brushes are very nice.</li>
    <li> Only thing i think i had a problem with was the smell.. they smelled like paint thinner..</li>
    <li> Decent set. Works well.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very good. I&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
    <li> I love the coloring, love the brushes, and love the little bag that came with it. None of the bristles are falling out and they work fantastically.</li>
    <li> My brushes are over a month late and I&#x27;m starting to get really impatient because everything else that I ordered came in but my brushes didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes especially the eye liner and eye shadow brushes</li>
    <li> This set is amazing , super soft barely shed ... Loved this more than a lot of my sigmas</li>
    <li> I purchased these because of all the great reviews and the great price, and they are amazing. Very soft and well structured. I ordered 5 more to personalize for bridesmaid gifts :)</li>
    <li> the holder is very cheap,the brushes are not that good,when i used it the hair of the brush starts to fall or will leave on your face</li>
    <li> Mine shed a lot and the tops fell off. Not a good product. It&#x27;s really not worth the time or money. DON&#x27;T BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Everyone was right, these do have a funky chemical smell---- it makes me worried as to how safe they are... I washed them clean however, so hopefully all is well</li>
    <li> The little wallet for the brushes is nicer than the actual brushes themselves. I ended up giving this item to a niece because it is more of a play set than a functional set.</li>
    <li> A couple of the brushes were broke, so I&#x27;m going to have to glue them back together. That&#x27;s my biggest issue with this. They come in a cute little case and the brushes, overall, are nice.</li>
    <li> I received the brushes but not the bag.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase, regardless of the affordable price, there is no skimp in value. This product is soft and works phenomenally. I actually went and purchased this in purple just to have a back up. Very pleased with my choice in the Pro Pink Makeup!♥</li>
    <li> A simple kit for a youny girl.It is made in china, Has all the brushes, Cute but inexpensive .A girl will like it</li>
    <li> This pack of brushes, that are so well made and soft, is an E&lt;br /&gt;xcellent bargain!..I use mine every day!..Sincerely, Carla G.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They work good.</li>
    <li> They fell apart in 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Ordered this a while ago and all I have to say is it&#x27;s amazing! They feel very soft and they last long until this day I still have and use them</li>
    <li> I am really happy with my brushes. They don&#x27;t smell, whatsoever, don&#x27;t shed, and are exactly as described. I purchased these as part of a gift for my daughter and will purchase a set for myself, as well.</li>
    <li> Great quality for a great price, thanks!</li>
    <li> I loved the color of these. I gave these as a gift to my son&#x27;s girlfriend and she was pleased.</li>
    <li> This product was a Great buy. Great gift to give to a bridesmaids party. I recommend it to all who doubt it.</li>
    <li> i love it ! the brush is soft and does not sheds like some people had complain about.&lt;br /&gt;wish it had more brushes like for foundation etc.</li>
    <li> They actually worked a little better than I expected but I was a little disappointed they came from China. :(</li>
    <li> This is a great brush set. Love the color and the different sizes included. They are super soft and work very well.</li>
    <li> The brushes are little more stiff than I was expecting, but it is a nice little set, with a case that makes it easy to travel with. I especially like the chiseled one for eyeliner.</li>
    <li> This was awesome for a beginner of make up i&#x27;m 15, and my friends thought I had a make artist! lol!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are very durable and soft as well. The bristles do not fall out which I LOVE since everyone I&#x27;ve bought at the store seems to fail. I would recommend this to any makeup lover since the brushes are different sizes. The carrying case isn&#x27;t pink it&#x27;s actually red, and pink is my favorite color so I would have loved to see a pink one! The brushes aren&#x27;t white either I think they are black or red as well.</li>
    <li> These brushes are a pretty good deal.I don&#x27;t know if I got Lucky or some people got Unlucky but, my set is pretty durable and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with any of the brushes so far. My favorite is the angled eye brush. I use it to apply eyeliner by using wet eye shadow on the brush -works better than pencil eye liner. The largest brush is pretty soft so I use it to apply a finer powder like translucent/highlighting face powder. My only problem with it was the smell of the brush case when I first opened it up ..pretty yucky plastic/chemical smell. But after a few days the smell went away.Other than that small thing these brushes are pretty awesome for the price.</li>
    <li> these brushes look exactly as pictured, they work very well and are durable. they dont loose the little hair thingies when you use them! and they arrived right on time too!</li>
    <li> Ok for NEW MAKE UP LEARNING APPLICATION. THEN MOVE UP TO HIGHER BRAND...</li>
    <li> These are soooo cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are so soft, the foundation one however is too soft for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the rest are PERFECT and wow. The price is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost didn&#x27;t want to use them because they are just so pretty... but I gave in because let&#x27;s be honest. Any real makeup person had to try at least a few right!??&lt;br /&gt;I will clean them I swear. Lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I would say it&#x27;s worth it. The case it cute, and who doesn&#x27;t want pink and white brushes!???&lt;br /&gt;So yes. I love.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re exactly what you pay for here. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, i really like the brushes but they&#x27;re just cheap quality. I use them mostly in place of my nice brushes or keep these ones in my purse. They&#x27;re soft enough but not too soft, and I find one or two of them to be completely useless.</li>
    <li> These work great! No fallout from the bristles at all. Even after washings. Very soft as well.</li>
    <li> Super cute and compact. Brushes are really soft and seem to be good quality. Case is great too!</li>
    <li> This is just a really cheap set of brushes. For the price I figured..&amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34;.. I gave them to my 3 year old twins to &amp;#34;play make-up&amp;#34; with. You get enough for the price they are asking...</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be a very good kit but it is missing some things yet the price is really good for starters such as me.</li>
    <li> Alot of brushes i have used get dirty quickly and break my skin out. These brushes are durable and stay nice for a long period of time. I can wash the brushes and let them air dry with no problem and they come back brand new just as if i just bought them.</li>
    <li> This set is a nice set of brushes. They don&#x27;t shed when you apply makeup. They fold up small and nicely to store in a drawer or purse. Plus, they&#x27;re cute.</li>
    <li> AMAZING brushes for the price they are at it is great the brushes themselves are a bit flimsy but they are very great and professional looking</li>
    <li> These brushes work really well for me. Washing was easy they always gain back their shape. I would like the same set to match but I would like it to be in a 22 pcs. Overall perfect for beginners like me.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It took forever to recieve it but was decent.</li>
    <li> I really like the brushes. They were better than I expected and the price was less than I had expected!</li>
    <li> I like these brushes they are very soft they look good the case is material not plastic but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for! The brushes are softer than expected as well.</li>
    <li> Cute brushes. Came on time. Just a little upset they break so easily. My blush brush broke in half when using it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get to use this much because my sister in law took it because she liked it so much. I didn&#x27;t mind because it was cheap I&#x27;ll end up ordering another one.</li>
    <li> 3 of them fell apart a few days after I got them but just a little super glue and you&#x27;re good. But they do work great</li>
    <li> Product wreaks of bug killer smell. Try the dollar store.</li>
    <li> great and i love the holder for the brushes and its good for the price</li>
    <li> love the bag I can cArry my brushes and it&#x27;s good product</li>
    <li> Nice set of brushes. These will be great for travel!</li>
    <li> Over all this is a ok set for the price. They eye shadow brush was a bit cheap and fell apart right away.</li>
    <li> They are easyly stained but they worked well and are VERY SOFT :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this last week and was so happy when I received it this morning, so shipping time was good. Then when I opened the product I fell in love. These brushes are so very well made and the quality of the bristles, so soft and supple, excellent for makeup application. At this price you simply cant beat it. I loved it so much I did a full video review for this product on youtube here: http://youtu.be/iLF_FVBCIfg If you can&#x27;t see the link just look up &amp;#34;Awesome 8 Piece Makeup Brush Set Review &amp;#34; by Dee Perry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice color (pink)  it work good and smoooooooth good makeup brushes to use for any make up you use I</li>
    <li> I got this brushes for my sisters in law and i loved it the case and everything is so cute and the brushes don&#x27;t look like they are cheap i totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> What u get for the $ was a great buy.  Great assortment of brushes in lovely fold up case - but since it came Int&#x27;l it took a while to get here.</li>
    <li> I like the product.. good quality and great customer service from the suppliers. The brushes are nice and soft. Great for the price</li>
    <li> Very cute packaging love the pink color great buy for the price</li>
    <li> I bought this last year but just bearly got using them. They were never taken out of their bag. The fist time I used them and the big brush broke. I love the bag were they come in  all the other brushes work fine or at least the ones I used except for the big one.</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I ordered a full set of brushes in one package and I must say that I was very satisfied with what I ordered. The brushes are soft and smooth and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin. These are going to be my best buddies when I&#x27;m putting makeup. I think I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> this particular item took a little over a month to deliver. so do no let order this and expect to get it within a week or two. honestly, there&#x27;s nothing too fancy about these brushes. but i have no complaints. they came in the right color, work properly after a few months, and seem to be holding up well. you definitely get what you pay for, maybe a little bit more.</li>
    <li> The brushes are soft and gentle. I bought this for my 13 year old daughter. She has used it a few times and the bristles on the foundation brush are coming out. The other brushes are fine. I gave it four stars because I still think we got our money&#x27;s worth with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love these. I bought them to apply glitter at my summer festivals but.....they&#x27;re too nice. I&#x27;m going to take my more expensive (lesser quality ones) and save these for real make-up. Love them!</li>
    <li> I got mine today and Im very pleased you guys did a great job.sincerly, mary scarlett oreilly thank you again</li>
    <li> Excellent makeup brushes for such a good price. I haven&#x27;t yet used them. However, I am impressed with what I received.  They appear to be good quality and packaged very pretty.</li>
    <li> I literally just got these, it only took 3 days for them to get here! The case is a bit weird, but it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m going to keep them in there anyway. Other than that, they&#x27;re extremely soft, the colors are pretty, and I can&#x27;t wait to try them out!</li>
    <li> I like the variety of brushes in the set. They are so soft and even though they are a little hard to clean, I am happy with how they have held up so far.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad , I get good use out of them . Got them earlier than expected</li>
    <li> For the price, these brushes are great, the quality seems nice, with soft bristles/brushes. Even the container is nice! I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> Nice​ set, great for traveling. The case is nice too.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for basically mines broke</li>
    <li> I pay for this, and it never become</li>
    <li> The brushes are great for the price. The only bad thing was it took several weeks to get here. But other than that I am completely satisfied</li>
    <li> They are awesome for the price! Very good quality!</li>
    <li> broke first use the brushes fall off at the handle ,  but they were soft brushes so i give a star for that</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received the defective items that did not match the item as it has described. For example, first, it says &amp;#34;8pcs Pro Pink Make up Brushes Set with Case&amp;#34;, but my order of 2 sets of this products did not have cases; second, they were NOT same brushes showing on the pictures at all. I&#x27;m very disappointing for this order.</li>
    <li> I wish there was a rating less than 1 star.  We like other posts also received this product and noticed a VERY STRONG smell of paint thinner on opening it such that we are returning it because we do not think it is safe for our kid to use.  I would not recommend any products from a company who&#x27;s quality control is obviously questionable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a few months now, and I still love them! They last forever, and work really well. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the carry case, so I did transfer them to my own makeup bag, but other than that... They&#x27;re perfect!</li>
    <li> Amazing! I get a lot of product for my money and I appreciate Amazon for making it available to me with the click of a button. The brushes are perfect for my teen and supercute and she loves them. I was very pleased when I received them!!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Received these today. The shipping took forever and the brushes are small. On the picture it look so big but they are actually small. It is perfect for play play at home. The eyebrow brush and comb is a perfect size but the facial brushes are too thin and small. Will keep it for traveling purposes.</li>
    <li> Its ok. Not spectacular not horrible. I find the blender brush takes off to much of the eye shadow so I have to put on multiple layers. Which is a pain because I don&#x27;t spend much time on my makeup. I only wear 1-3 products at one time most centering around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend. Very cheap and small. Fell apart after I used them 3 times. The colors weren&#x27;t accurate. The only brush I kept was the angled one.</li>
    <li> This product fell apart immediately after I used it for the first time. It&#x27;s better to invest in more expensive brushes just once than to keep having to buy cheap ones that fall apart</li>
    <li> Decent for price, but some of the pieces are falling apart right out of the package. Hairs falling out of brushes and the eyelash comb was not properly attached to the handle and fell of in shipment.</li>
    <li> I was so excited for new makeup brushes and was so disappointed by these ones. The little hairs were coming off them right off the bat. I had to bend them to make the bristles stay. They didn&#x27;t perform adequitly. Very disapointing</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok brushes but I just expected softer brushes then I got but you getwhat you pay for they were cheap</li>
    <li> I ordered these a couple weeks ago i got them veryyyy quickly. As they are very cute. They are also very cheap. Some spots of the brush is longer then others which yes you can trim down. Also spots on the white handle is missing paint they work good just be careful with them there not very strong.</li>
    <li> This is my very first make up little kit. I was surprised when I walked to my mailbox and saw it sitting in there on the very first day its arrival was.expected so I will say delivery was excellent.  Now I was also expecting it to be smaller but its still good enough for me its bigger than what I was expecting. Its a travel size. Looks like it does in the pic.Gonna upload a pic. I will definitely order more in the future for birthday and Christmas gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy and gonna put them to use now :)</li>
    <li> Super soft, no shedding, holds product very well.</li>
    <li> This pack is great!!  I can take it anywhere and the brushes are top notch! I absolutely love it! thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my mom, and she loves them! I&#x27;m even considering repurchasing one for myself because of how nice they were. Bristles didnt come out at all and all the brushes were intact. Only thing is the case smells a lil like paint/plastic but its not very strong. Anyway I love them!</li>
    <li> the brushes are made really nicely i was shocked the pink case is cheap an ugly but that i guess u can throw away but i did like the brushes an the were soft as well nice lil set for a young girl</li>
    <li> I have a limited supply of makeup brushes at my disposal, and was in need of some new ones. These are PERFECT. I used a gift card to purchase these and several other items, and these came in 4 days early, and are WONDERFUL. They are softer than the brushes that I normally purchase, and work great. I plan on ordering more of these as soon as I can for my sister and friend!</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time. Unfortunately, each of the brushes broke at the first use. The metal part is glued to the wooden stick with a cheap glue.</li>
    <li> I love my new brush set its small enough to fit inside my purse and i love the pink design.</li>
    <li> The brushes are beautiful pink n fluffy (: totally recommend them totally worth for such a small price buy them</li>
    <li> bad quality brushes fall apart from stems.. would not buy them again or recommend them to any one else UGGHHH</li>
    <li> One of the brushes came actually broken, but I repaired it with glue and that was it. The rest of them were in perfect condition and they are actually really soft which makes them perfect for a girl&#x27;s skin :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this make up brish set and gave it to my mother for Christmas she loved her present .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed and purchased these brushes twice now.  What can I see besides how much I love them? I&#x27;ve bought them for myself and as gifts for friends.  No one has had a single complaint. I even got an extra set of them for my young daughter to play with.  We use these to play makeup with and that alone was worth the price. They&#x27;re affordable and great quality and I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I love them. Will order again!!!!</li>
    <li> I recived them today so was a very Long wait Then i open the package and the smell was very strong n foul smelling hope ful they will air out</li>
    <li> Pretty case.  The brushes work very nicely.  I was pleased with the product and would buy again. More than I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> Work so good love them !! Exactly what the described! I love the big brushes! Amazing, cool and the color love it</li>
    <li> I ordered this set because I love pink and they were cheap. I didn&#x27;t mind waiting for them, It took about 2 weeks to get them. When I opened the package the product was just as it shows in the picture. I used them that day and the very first brush broke free from the stick part. So I check the rest of them and they all did the same thing. No biggie a dab of gorilla glue solved that issue. I won&#x27;t fuss because you get what you pay for... so 3 stars for this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a  terrible product. However, the brushes really don&#x27;t pick up the products well. I have to use so much &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; product for the brushes to pick them up. However, it&#x27;s not a bad buy for a beginner or someone who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend.</li>
    <li> I love me lashes, they are perfect full look I like and at a great price, I will be buying them again!!!!!</li>
    <li> just as shown in the picture, love the vibrate baby pink the bag is. The brushes are shorted than I expected but work just the same. Overall, i&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The brushes are extremely soft and does not shed at all not to mention the case is cute.... overall GREAT DEAL</li>
    <li> The bristles are soft! Jeez, really soft. Didn&#x27;t shed too much after washing (the little ones), but the metal ferrule did come off the wooden handle. Just glued it back on. Besides that, no real problem with these.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected it was cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush set for a surprise gift for my girlfriend. She had been complaining she needed some new brushes. She loves them. Great product.</li>
    <li> Work great, easy to clean! I love the carrying case and the feel of the brushes. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very good quality. They were very flimsy and a few of them broke off the handle after only a couple of users. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> These were ok brushes. The thinner ones are made like from nylon string or that thinner one. But they&#x27;re not soft. Like fluffy soft. More like flat. I didn&#x27;t like the bag because it has a long string attached to the closing and it is ugly. I guess these brushes are made for beginners, not that i&#x27;m a pro, but i just didn&#x27;t like them so much.</li>
    <li> I love these! They are so soft! Best $4 I ever spent!</li>
    <li> i thought the brushes would come out really crap because it was so cheap, but when it came it looked so pretty and was so soft!&lt;br /&gt;Good for the price!</li>
    <li> The brushes themselves work alright, but are almost too soft to pick up makeup/ apply it to skin. They also break easily as the tips aren&#x27;t glued solidly into the handles.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing set of brushes for beginners,  super soft and a great price i was surprise they were that much quality considering the price i love them, shipping was very fast..</li>
    <li> i recieved these brushes sooner then estimated delivery which was nice. the top of the eyebrow brush was coming off so i just glued it back on other wise i would say they are nice.</li>
    <li> Good quality and easy to use and perfect to carry away even it&#x27;s not the color that i want but i still love it</li>
    <li> Brushes seem like they are sturdy enough to last for a while. Definitely worth the $3.00 I paid for them! Shipping was faster than expected. I think I received my brushes about two and a half weeks after I ordered them, which is considerably fast coming from the UK.</li>
    <li> Good for the price especially if you are just starting with make up. I purchased these to use as practice brushes and have decided to use them on a reg</li>
    <li> These are the perfect brushes for me, exactly what I was looking for. The top is very soft and they work great for blending. They came with instructions on how to clean them. The case is cute and durable. I think I will enjoy these for a long time as they don&#x27;t fall apart or shed at all. Thank you.</li>
    <li> product not sturdy enough to even apply makeup. waist of money on my part. dont make the same mistake i did</li>
    <li> Nice soft brushes, easy to clean, plus, I didn&#x27;t notice,  but it has a liner brush, which is great because I always used an angle brush, but the liner brush gives a nice clean line.</li>
    <li> really cool for makeup</li>
    <li> Very cheap brushes that she&#x27;s all over the place one of which actually completely lost all of the hair without any use don&#x27;t bother</li>
    <li> Loving them so much, they are supper soft and applying make up is now more fun than ever before with all of the pink :D &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This product never came  It said it came two weeks early, I waited two weeks and it never showed. So disappointing.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my niece&#x27;s tween sleepover, so she can do makeovers and not ruin my brushes. That being said I didn&#x27;t expect the best quality. Which they weren&#x27;t. What did bother me is that the set had a bad chemical Odor. I washed them to make sure they were safe to use.</li>
    <li> Gave them to my daughter who is 27 and more into makeup than me and she really seemed to like the brushes.</li>
    <li> I like this product i gave only 4 stars instead of 5 just because i didnt really &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; the product, but i dont see anything wrong with it. I am using them just fine. Thanks :)</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! Great price and amazing for beginners! The Brissles don&#x27;t fly away and are very absorbant. Arrived on time and are adorable! Also a great assortment of brushes. Definalty should purchase these brushes!</li>
    <li> Exactly how I thought it would be. Excellent product! The quality is incredible and it was here in no time!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful set of brushes that are truly high end. The fun part is that the brushes are pink on the tips. It was just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Bad quality broke the first day I got them.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 sets neither came with the pink bag and the brissels on the brushes are hard.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay ... Good for 2 or 3 months</li>
    <li> Its been almost 2 months and I haven&#x27;t receibed anything !!</li>
    <li> These are cute brushes but on the one all the hairs came out! :( Everything else was good though.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes they look exactly the same as the pictures best thing I ever bought</li>
    <li> the brushes were cute and soft and easy travel although the brush you would use to apply eye shadow really dosent apply the eyeshadow just kind of sticks to the brush and doesnt go on to my face ive tried several different eye shadows on several different people faces and several different surfaces and yet it didnt really work .</li>
    <li> Love these! Ordering another set today! Cheap price, great brushes that look pretty too. Cant go wrong with these brushes!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes the color and all now for the price I figured they would be a little on the cheap end but they are really nice and work for exactly what I need them for! Highly recommend for a girl on a budget</li>
    <li> Great brushes for a super cheap price!</li>
    <li> Most of the brushes are great, but the eyeliner brush is too soft. It needs to be slightly stiffer for me because I have OCD and nothing can be out of place.</li>
    <li> It is exactly as the photo! very nice, all the brushes have soft pink bristles. Nice pink case to be able to take in your purse or when you travel. A very good buy! Excellent price!</li>
    <li> The brushes are great i especially love the eye shadow brushes the only thing is that the blush brush was smaller than expected but overall loved everything❤️</li>
    <li> I needed brushes nd didnt want to pay alot. I liked the pink nd the pink pouch that it comes in so I decided to try these even though the reviews werent that great. Glad I did. I like them. They get the job done nd don&#x27;t shed. I can be rough with my brushes sometimes nd they look brand new. The pouch, NOT the brushes, did have a dif type smell to it but it didnt bother me. I just put it on a table infront a fan nd let it air for a couple days. Honesty to me the smell, smells like a very sharp \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; type smell like something yu buy nd take out the bag but this smells alot stronger but it doesnt bother me at all. If it reallys bothers ppl just throw the case away because the brushes don&#x27;t smell bad. Its been 3 months maybe since I&#x27;ve got them nd I can still smell a faint \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; smell if I put it up to my nose. But these brushes were good quality nd I love this pink shade.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay.. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I recieved the brushes quickly but they smelled really bad,they were poorly put together.The brushes started to come apart as I used them</li>
    <li> actually i got it for cleaning my canon camera from the sand and dust. i needed one brush and a cleaning kit cost 10$.&lt;br /&gt;the brushes are of medium quality and its case smells really bad. i threw it away and will never use it for make up anyway, so i am satisfied</li>
    <li> I received most of the makeup brushes but I was missing 2 the eyebrow brush and the smaller eyeshadow brush my powder brush completely fell out but I figured that was my fault since I hadn&#x27;t used them or taken out since I already had others in used</li>
    <li> These brushes are really soft and great for traveling.  I love the angeled eyeliner brush!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, excellent case, great brushes for the price. Using a few of them everyday for a couple weeks and no bristles have come out. Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> I was exited when I got these. They were smaller than I expected, &amp;&#x27; they kinda of feel fake &amp;&#x27; look like little kids makeup brushes. I haven&#x27;t tried them yet though, so I don&#x27;t know how they perform.</li>
    <li> They feel pretty cheap but work fine. Wouldn&#x27;t use to do any serious make-up but for tweaking things here and there or as a temporary brush set, it&#x27;s decent. For the price, you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
    <li> They are adorable ! thank you</li>
    <li> Pros: Cute colors, nice carrying case, relatively good quality brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None that I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good purchase for somebody who isn&#x27;t a makeup connoisseur.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;With superior-quality,&amp;#34; said description of the product, but I say &amp;#34;Bad quality&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this one don&#x27;t be upset about broken parts. After first using, one of the brushes went to two separate parts....I fixed it and .... after second using,  another brush was accidentally separated, too.</li>
    <li> Brushes are kind of stiff.  Love the blush brush and eyebrow brush, though.  Good variety of brushes for all uses.  Good for the price, but took awhile to get here coming from China.</li>
    <li> I got this set a couple days ago and so far I love it.  I used a brush cleanser before I started using them for safe measure and the smell that some have noted doesn&#x27;t stay.  The shadow brushes work REALLY well, even better than the slightly-higher brand brushes I normally use.  The face powder brush is okay, thought it&#x27;d be bigger but I wasn&#x27;t really pining for that anyways.  They&#x27;re all soft and fairly sturdy.  Will update if any changes occur.  I rate the item five starts overall because LOOK AT THAT PRICE.</li>
    <li> Loved how they came. Took a little long to get to me and it has a smell of paint but besides that i love the brushes.</li>
    <li> The hair in brushes are already coming out. Brushes are smaller then I expected its really cute but bush sucks</li>
    <li> I this set sooooooo much! &amp; i ordered it on Monday &amp; it came in the mail today (Thursday) ! Although it does have a factory smell, I don&#x27;t mind it at all! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Nice set for the price.  I&#x27;m not a huge make up wearer, but I needed some different size brushes and this was fine for my needs. The case is cute, but not needed. I don&#x27;t travel or take my brushes with me so I can&#x27;t comment on how durable the case would be. All in all great set of brushes to start or for occasional make up application.</li>
    <li> Brushes are soft, I like that they are small enough to carry around easily</li>
    <li> when i received this product i thought they were really nice but as soon as i tried using it they started falling apart, i am not happy with these and i dont plan on buying from thiss company anymore</li>
    <li> This set was good for me because i hardly wear make up plus it was cheap and I never found any at the stores for the same price but the brushes work good plus the hairs feel soft.</li>
    <li> The brushes came out good the only thing is that they have a weird smell</li>
    <li> Firstly, I do know that these were super cheap. But holy moly I expected them to be a little sturdier. I opened the package, and they smelled so bad it was unbelievable. So I washed them really quick and the smell dissipated pretty quickly. But the next day, 3 of them were coming apart and all of the metal separated from the handle. I give these three stars because the brush parts were really really soft and seem to distribute product on my face pretty well. Plus, the colors are really pretty.</li>
    <li> Very good product for the value.</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes and the price is right</li>
    <li> This is a really good product and at first I got it from the mail it smelled bad but the smell faded away and it is awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> The quality of the case is great! The brushes are as well! I have been looking for good quality cheap brushes and these are it!</li>
    <li> This was a christmas present for my sister and she loved it.  Thinking of buying one for myself and my daughter.</li>
    <li> First, my eyeshadow one is useless now because I tried to rinse it out and the whole head came off. So that was fun. Otherwise, the set is perfectly functional. I use the face/blush brush more than any of the others, but they work for their purposes. I won&#x27;t say they work as well as more expensive brushes, but they are satisfactory for their price.</li>
    <li> quality of brush are horrible gave to niece to play with not a good make upset looking for a better set .</li>
    <li> I really was skeptical about buying these, because they were actually the first thing I&#x27;ve ever ordered on Amazon. I&#x27;m certainly pleased with it, and they put on my makeup like a dream! I have to say that some of the brushes were a tad bent, and some hairs fell out, but that is to be expected. You really do get what you pay for, so for the price it&#x27;s a very smart purchase!</li>
    <li> when i got this product it was damaged and when you take the brush out of the slots it breaks half of the brush is cheap. I highly highly recommend  you read these reviews and don&#x27;t but this product</li>
    <li> I received it quicker than expected! Its a complete set of basic make up brushes. Comes in a cute carrying case! Only draw back is I had to let the case air out cause it smelled a little like plastic when I received it, other than that, good quality bushes!</li>
    <li> The brushes are not at all sturdy. Bristles came out with first use!! Very disappointed... I am a bit wary to order from you again. Hopefully other products will be better...</li>
    <li> It looks as a picture shown. very nice, very comfortable, sets perfectly. This is what i needed. Thanks a lot :)</li>
    <li> Ive had these brushes for a few months now and i don&#x27;t really use them as much anymore because they don&#x27;t really get the job done as well as a stiff brush. Hard to get makeup on.</li>
    <li> All of the brushes are very soft and efficient. Only complaint I have is the head of the brow brush fell off (if that&#x27;s the name for it, I&#x27;m not experienced in makeup). Nothing super glue can&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> I love these, they&#x27;re so cute and soft and seem to be very good material!! But I wish there was a spooly included, other then that I love them and use them everyday.</li>
    <li> Im glad I got these on sale because if they were full price, they wouldn&#x27;t be worth the price. I ordered these because they were cute and I have been in need of some new brushes, and only a few aspects of these disappoint me.&lt;br /&gt;  A few of the brushes I got were kindof stiff and not soft, but over all I love all of the liner brushes and the angled brush. My &amp;#34;brow/eyelash comb&amp;#34; (I dont know the technical term) was probably the most disappointing one of all. My black brush part of it came with some of the hair type out of wack, I had to just trim those hairs off.&lt;br /&gt;  Either way, decent for the price, but E.l.f brushes are just as good if not better. Shipping was great, arrived a week before I was told it was going to. The case is cute, and the eyeliner brushes are great.</li>
    <li> I have waited patiently for this to come thru the mail. I am happy it finally came so I can actually use it.</li>
    <li> great fast shipping good quality and great addition to my other brushes. I would recommend this to anyone as a starter kit or just an additional kit to ad to your other brushes</li>
    <li> Not dense at all flimsy and not worth the money. Passssssss thank you very much. Save your dollars up and buy something worth it.</li>
    <li> For the price, I got what I expected. They work great. there is a little fallout in the bristles but I would recommend.</li>
    <li> when it came i thought it would be soft....but the bristles were really harsh....the powder brush just started to fall apart</li>
    <li> Really love the brushes and the neat lite bag it comes ...it&#x27;s helps to protect and store really easy..ordered two by accident and have one to my bestie and she loves them as we&#x27;ll...good quality for a cheap price</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my brush set! It&#x27;s the perfect size and the color goes great with everything else that I have for my makeup.</li>
    <li> The time frame was long but the product is nice for the price.</li>
    <li> Very VERY soft brushes. But unfortunately mine broke easily. But worth the price.</li>
    <li> i love it so much they are so soft and do everything i want them to do :)</li>
    <li> Not the best quality, but AMAZING for the price. And arrived days before the expected arrival date. Very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> The price is very very reasonable for an 8 piece makeup brush. I love the pink color and the leather. The only con for this is that the synthetic brush is falling out.</li>
    <li> Good brushes. Quick shipment. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I received the brushes today and as soon as i took them out of the package, the bristles started falling!! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these! Dont waste youre money!</li>
    <li> This actually worked good in my face the brushes are so soft nd to top it off it&#x27;s pink 😍👌</li>
    <li> This is the best brush set! I ordered this on a satrday and it came the following Thursday! Everything is perfect! Never happier</li>
    <li> Brushes were nice and pretty but case is not as pretty and not really what I expected. Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough but the case looked just plain pink only but was pink with odd lettering print , nor t that noticeable but....</li>
    <li> I bought these more for photos, I liked the colors and they are small. They turned out to be good quality brushes, and a nice travel set, and I do use them when I travel.</li>
    <li> Just got my item. According to the shipment, it would get here in a month but I got it like in a week.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very beautiful... The only thing is that the smell of the fabric of the case is a little strong, other than that is great</li>
    <li> They haven&#x27;t given me any problems. They are really nice</li>
    <li> This product was very cute and has good quality for the price. I love the colors and the brushes are smooth and very soft to the touch. It&#x27;s perfect for my makeup</li>
    <li> right as i took the eyeshadow brush out it came apart...you definatly get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Perfect set of brushes for on the go. I would not recommend for everyday use though.</li>
    <li> These are very good brushes for the price. All of them work amazing but the biggest issue was the smell of strong plastic when I opened the package. Other then that I recommend these brushes to anyone on a budget because they get the job done. Maybe if they added a small blending brush then I would give 5 stars but these are amazing for travel.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes , It took a little while to get here but that&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> This brush set is amazing, All the brushes were received and I couldnt have been more happy about the nice pouch it comes in! the bristles are not a plastic like you would find in most other cheap brush sets, they are very nice and soft and pretty! Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love it...just what I needed!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read alllllll of the reviews before i bought these. You&#x27;ll hear problems like bristles falling out instantly, too small, cheap..... blah blah blah. Well nay-sayers, I&#x27;m sorry you got a defaulted product, but I love them :D The pink touches are so cute! I personally think the size is perfect ladies ;) And who could beat the price?? Would recommend to anyone. Whatta steal</li>
    <li> Because I love the way the brush feels on my skin and how evenly it&#x27;s puts the make up on</li>
    <li> I loved them and very fast shipping I really recommend this item . Will most certainly be buying again .. Pretty pink and use them every day ..</li>
    <li> They are good brushes to have around as extras or to use a couple times and throw out. Not the highest of quality but not horrid.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see the problem everyone else is having with these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I found them to be quite nice, and the bristles are very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Everything seems to be well put together and I haven&#x27;t seen a single shred come off of them.&lt;br /&gt;Really great price for a really great product.</li>
    <li> Loved the product but the material of the bag that the brushes are in is unraveling and I just received the package . Like when I opened it , the bag was like that .</li>
    <li> The brushes are loosing apart</li>
    <li> I didnt receive my item (past 1 month already).</li>
    <li> Have had these for about 3 months and within the first month my small eyeshadow broke after I washed it. Really sad about that and still havent been able to replace them.</li>
    <li> not the best quality but for the price are ok</li>
    <li> Love the price in real life they cost $5-$20!</li>
    <li> So this is the initial review. I touched the bristles of the brushes, they were really soft. I plan to use them for applying halloween make up and prosthetics, so we shall see how they hold up afterwards.</li>
    <li> I still have not used this because I do not yet know how to apply make up lol. So for beginners nice little small wallet size kit.</li>
    <li> The brushes are okay! they don&#x27;t blend all to well and some arrived already broken but if you must buy,buy it!</li>
    <li> I really love this set of brushes! I love the case it comes with. The brushes work well. Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I like my new brushes they meet my need, at and at a very good price. I am very happy thank you so much.</li>
    <li> They are so cute, it has everything I need in it except for my eyelash curler. ;) I love the case too.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft love the pink</li>
    <li> These are soft brushes and I got them earlier than the expected delivery date. However, when I opened the case, there were paint chips all over the brushes. They also have a horrible smell and soome pf tge brushes have fallen out and I havnt even used the brushes yet! Im afraid to wash them because I dont want ay more bristles to fall  out.</li>
    <li> From reading the other reviews, and in desperate need of new brushes, I immediately purchased this item. I&#x27;ve had them for about a week and one broke the second I used it. They&#x27;re not what I expected, to be honest.</li>
    <li> it was okay i thought they looked like they would work better then they do they dont work bad you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Awesome I love them and they came super fast. I was hesitant but I&#x27;m glad I bought them</li>
    <li> there are not very strong</li>
    <li> Although these are not as thick as the few brushes I have left, and love. I needed a new set and decided to give these a try, plus they have pink tips, how cool and sexy is that! lol :)&lt;br /&gt;I tried out the brushes that I know will end up being my daily brushes, especially if Im traveling bc they have that super cute carrying case, and no problem! I may of had to put an extra layer of eye shadow on but that was about it! They work like a charm! Thinner then the more expensive brushes, but they work great! Even the blush brush, and honestly ...I hate blush brushes, almost just threw this one away with out trying it bc I love my mini kabuki brush for that. But bc I was and Am writing a review, I tried it...and it was a perfect application. Beyond pleased by these brushes, and just WOW due to the price! Im very surprised at the quality! :)</li>
    <li> loved it at first but then the first time i used the eyebrow comb it came off -_- so i fixed it and put it back on it works better now not worth mailing back for a refund since it took a while to get to me so yeah still a cute product tho....other than the eyebrow comb/brush the rest of the brushes worked they weren&#x27;t loose or anything so ya.</li>
    <li> it worked for everything i needed al makeups it amazing buy it you wont believe how good it is and itll last forever and thoughs stupid bristles wont fall out !</li>
    <li> Brushes came on time, they are in very good condition and i use them everyday. So cute and soft. Im happy with my new make u brushes.</li>
    <li> Awesome just what I needed, great quality. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great little kit to carry with you for touchups throughout the day or night.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic value for the money</li>
    <li> Great beginner brushes. Bristles are really soft and good quality! Super fast shipping! Came in 4-5 days.</li>
    <li> Came quickly. Brand new and as pictured. I gave 4 stars because the brushes smell like glue, but smell wears off.</li>
    <li> I loved these brushes! Came within a reasonable amount of time, the packaging didn&#x27;t have an odor, the brushes work great and none of the bristles or anything have fallen out and I&#x27;ve used almost every piece to the set! I just wash them in cold water once I&#x27;m done and there&#x27;s no shedding at all! I really love these and will definitely buy again from this seller! :)!</li>
    <li> Such an amazing product(: came in 4 days early, was carefully put in place and was exactly like the photo. I can&#x27;t not wait to order more</li>
    <li> Brushes work great but break easily.</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Good quality. To ship to New York it took a month.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Cool color, great quality. Def would but again.</li>
    <li> Bad quality........like very bad! Feels like brushing your face with plastic brushes</li>
    <li> It is very cute and the brushes seem to be great quality. I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> Only the smaller eye brushes work for me, they do a good job in highlighting the inner corners of my eyes, but that&#x27;s pretty much it. The brushes are stiff to the touch and not at all soft.</li>
    <li> these brushes are soft and great to use, would recommend this due to its low price and great quality</li>
    <li> Super Soft brushes, and the color is just a bonus!</li>
    <li> I thought these brushes were &#x27;okay&#x27; not the best. It had a weird paint smell to it that I can&#x27;t seem to get rid of, but I was a bit disappointed on how they feel on my face; texture and all.  The package is cute but I would recommend giving this to younger girls.  Just my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love these this is the first actually set I have ever purchased and I will buy more and use them for gifts!</li>
    <li> These are great, it does have a smell so u want to wash before the first use. I tried pulling the hair to see if it would break amd it didnt! I love it and for the price its great!</li>
    <li> Love them! I didn&#x27;t think they would be travel size but it&#x27;s perfect to keep in my bag they came way before time and I love unexpected packages the purple tin is actually pink it&#x27;s perfect super soft. The lip brushw as the only brush that came with any extra plastic covering though</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, its the perfect  for me and now my eye makeup stays flawless from when I apply it to when I remove it. I love it and highly recommend it. And they my favorite color too.!!!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping ! Havnt had any fall out of the brushes yet and you really can&#x27;t beat the price ! Thanks for a great product !</li>
    <li> Ehh, okay. I thought they were a bit bigger though, they came as a small package.  The advantage is that I can take it anywhere so that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I like the brushes but there a lil to soft for my liking</li>
    <li> I love these brushed they work great and I got them for super cheap I love it, definitely will buy more.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even know where these brushes are but despite that they broke on first use..the brush part came right off the handle...total waste of money.. i knew that but i just wanted to add a few brushes to my collection..</li>
    <li> These are really good! I like these! I love how there pink! They work awesome!! Love these! Buy these now! 😘😘😍😍😛😛😜🙌🙋</li>
    <li> Very nice looking set of brushes, I love how compact it is and will fit great in my suitcase. Thanks</li>
    <li> They work great and I got everything I needed, Thank you so much.i love the case and it&#x27;s going to be a great gift.</li>
    <li> Good item but one of my brushes was broke. The item was Smaller then I thought but I like the brushes.</li>
    <li> Brushes arrived early but the packaging stinks like spray paint and when I opened them 2 out of the 8 brushes were broken the eyebrow comb top fell off as soon as I opened it the big eye shadow brush tip fell off the base!!! Glueing them back on now.. The aluminum band isn&#x27;t purple it&#x27;s a dark pink and they are half the size of a normal brush. Won&#x27;t order again . They are soft and grab the eyeshadow and I like the pink ..</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice.  I would recommend to someone who are needing these as a backup set.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain.  It is nice for the price</li>
    <li> Its cute. Arrived quickly. Overall loved it</li>
    <li> Got these for my 15 year old and she really like them!!</li>
    <li> Perfect; exactly as showed, takes a bit to ship, but the price its worth it.</li>
    <li> In love! Came sooner than its delivery date, which i love! XD perfect condition , soft and even looks better in person! and  Used it about 4weeks (still using it!! ) wash it every night , and still looks and works as new!i would recommend &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but it looks to be what I need.</li>
    <li> Had these for months, and I love them! They&#x27;ve lasted me a good amount of time, and are still going. Love the design and color!</li>
    <li> soft brushes and they dont shed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really used to using makeup brushes, but these seem to be really great. I love how they look and the brushes are really soft.</li>
    <li> THEY ARE SOO FREAKIN CUTEE !!!! I gave them a 4. Because the biggest brush was breaking a little but i fixed it &amp; i love them !!</li>
    <li> it took only few days and i was so happy...it so cute and so soft...i am satisfied!</li>
    <li> Great deal. Hairs never fell out even when cleaning them. They all came in tact and have the perfect range of sizes, along with a cute little brush bag. Got some like these previously for around the same deal, money wise, from a local store. They were plain black and the hairs always fell out. Which was annoying, i wear glasses so sometimes i didn&#x27;t notice them all on my face, anyway, These didnt fall out at all. Good deal, yes shipped from China but most things here are made from there anyway... might as well get it shipped from there. Cutting out the middle man (american stores)  makes it way cheaper. Like i said, great deal.</li>
    <li> Very good and arrival time</li>
    <li> Great quality but doesn&#x27;t come with a very good foundation brush, it&#x27;s too small to use for foundation</li>
    <li> they fell apart..not surprised-got what i paid for</li>
    <li> These make up brushes aren&#x27;t made cheap! I love the makeup brushes and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase . It&#x27;s exactly what I expected it to be and I&#x27;m a happy customer . I will definitely buy again :)</li>
    <li> They work pretty good except the bigger one from all that one don&#x27;t work for s***</li>
    <li> Not durable.  It&#x27;s be gas falling apart n had to throw it away 2nd week.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this cheap garbage.</li>
    <li> They were in time and really pretty and soft, like the color and it is exactly what is on the picture really like them.</li>
    <li> these work great, very good product</li>
    <li> **im on my boyfriend&#x27;s Amazon acc btw!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these on a whim ($3 brushes? Too good to be true.) and based my purchase off of the reviews, which many highlight/emphasize &amp;#34;good for the price!&amp;#34; I mean, I guess. They&#x27;re not the worst but they&#x27;re definitely not very good. I tested them out and never tried them again. Brushes were soft but too soft to work with! Eyeshadow brush didn&#x27;t do well with packing on eyeshadow...I&#x27;m guessing a majority of reviewers haven&#x27;t used good quality brushes...and if you can&#x27;t afford it, these are an okay start/alternative but these were very lackluster (should have known better..)</li>
    <li> brushes are okay quality. Not the best but not the worst. I guess you get what you pay for. I do love the angled eyeliner brush and the pouch but everything else i could live without.</li>
    <li> These pink brushes are so cute I love them I wish they had brushes f</li>
    <li> Nice product for the price. Arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Good Brushes, really soft. I read that some customers&#x27; brushes fell apart but mine didn&#x27;t (yet?). My only 2 problems: some brushes have a couple strands longer, easy to fix, i just cut off long strands and the case smelled like chemicals, like paint thinner or something. pretty gross but good in functionality. i also hate that i have 3 blush brushes now lol i don&#x27;t use blush much but oh well :)</li>
    <li> Super soft and pretty brushes. The pink is so light and pretty. So far I really like these brushes and for the price I would recommend them!</li>
    <li> I love all of the brushes they are sooo soft! I love that they come with a little case it made it so easy to travel with! LOVE THEM</li>
    <li> I thought  I was getting a good deal for these brushes - it&#x27;s a complete set, with a traveler&#x27;s case (plus the brushes are pretty). But the bristles starting coming out of some of the brushes before I even used them. Then the heads started separating from the handles of the brushes. I glued them back together myself and now they&#x27;re fine, which tells you how cheaply this brushes are made.</li>
    <li> I am a huge makeup lover and I needed some eye makeup brushes and the case is very adorable but I don&#x27;t use it. The brushes are really soft and I like most of them.</li>
    <li> What a deal! I&#x27;m not sure what other buyers are talking about as far as quality. No strand are coming off the brushes on the set I received! they are extremely soft and of a good quality. For the price unbelievable good! I am very happy and I am considering reordering for gifts!</li>
    <li> Great quality for great price.</li>
    <li> Awesome, the wife loves them and that is all I can ask for. Daddy can make mommy happy sometimes!</li>
    <li> These brushes are ehhh. All the reviews were great so I decided to trust and buy them! Though I was impressed buy how fast they shipped, the color, the softness,the price, and the free shipping; I was unimpressed of how much they fell apart and broke. If someone knows how to contact the sellers, that would be greatly appreciated because I do believe that the set I got was just a mistake.</li>
    <li> When I got these in the mail, I was extremely excited to use them. However, the blush brush&#x27;s brush part popped off the minute I pulled it out. The case is cute, although a little weird and unnecessary, but the brushes themselves hold color well. The go on nice. The brushes DO smell like plastic, though, which I was kinda weirded out about. But it doesn&#x27;t make my face smell weird, and that&#x27;s what matters. All in all, well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is the most awesome burgs set I have ever had, thanks!!</li>
    <li> It was fine for what it was</li>
    <li> It looks like it&#x27;s for a little girl , it&#x27;s cute but not for a grown women ,</li>
    <li> Brushes fell off the handle. Cheap, cheap cheap.</li>
    <li> I love these so much!!! They&#x27;re awesome.</li>
    <li> I loveee love love love these brushes I actually made a review of them on my youtube channel here is the link check it out and please like and subscribe to my channel on youtube my name is Amanda lee.... I like these brushes so much , if your looking for simple , soft make up brushes that will give you a bang for your buck .. look no further !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;copy and paste this link below to your tool bar xo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;V46GRei6Mlo&amp;list&#x3D;UUB97OGkfEMIxNunRacNIG-g</li>
    <li> They are nice and super soft loved them, i recommend them to people and the price super cheap for these brushes</li>
    <li> What a deal. I have been looking for a makeup brush set for my teenager that was not costly, but still effective. I saw this and ordered it immediately. After all, it was a steal AND it was in her 2 favorite colors! When I received the item, it was just as described and higher quality than I expected. I&#x27;m chalking this one up as a total steal! Look, its not professional grade, but if you&#x27;re looking for an affordable makeup brush set, this is IT!</li>
    <li> I got the package on time and I was so excited to use them! Right away when using them the bristles were falling out. I figured maybe it was just a few but the whole thing was falling apart. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> good quality for what you pay. but the odor where they came was too strong and kind of weird .</li>
    <li> oh my .fastest shipping ever . I AM IN LOVE</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother spending a ton of money on some of the other listings for these brushes. These are perfect. I use them every day.</li>
    <li> The Day i received this item it broke the first monent i tried to use it. I wouldnt suggest this product to anyone unless youre just on a budget and dont plan on using it for long</li>
    <li> I actually ordered 2 sets and never received the second set... Brushes are great though. Would be great if I had my other set..</li>
    <li> Good for this price (around 2 dollars) but the color is hard to get off once its on. anyway good for new learner</li>
    <li> These brushes are really soft! They don&#x27;t get rough or anything after washing and the color is really nice as well. The only bad thing is that they smelled a bit weird when i first opened them but the smell did not linger after washing. Other than that these are great brushes especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy! They just got here, and earlier than they were expected to. They smell kinda funny but thats okay!</li>
    <li> my favorite out of the set has to be the fluffy brush. its perfect for applying blush. these were perfect for me, and i would recommend them to others. easily cleaned and the bristles don&#x27;t end up becoming rough feeling and poke you like other cheaper brushes do.</li>
    <li> Got my order fast a nice little set of brushes for when you on the go overall really happy w it</li>
    <li> Love my brushes. They are everything I expected and nothing cheap about them. They are exactly what was advertised on the page.</li>
    <li> Cute brushes easy to put on the bag and i love pink thank you I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to others :)</li>
    <li> bought it for my daugther. She loves it. Says it soft and applies makeup quite well.</li>
    <li> They were really pretty, I did not use them and bought them as gifts for friends. I think they will be a great starter brush set.</li>
    <li> It came right on time and the actual item is just as described! The brushes are so cute and the bag it comes in is nice. Of course a few of the brushes might have a little flaws(some glue sticking out/ weak bristles on the eyebrow brush) but still, you can&#x27;t beat the price lol. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase! :)</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re okay, they get the job done but I don&#x27;t like how they break easily</li>
    <li> You probably need to use them often to make them more fluffy. but i would buy the 22 pc set if i were u</li>
    <li> I chosen 5 stars bc it does with wat I wanted I will tell every1 I knw were to get it..</li>
    <li> very pleased with purchase!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these makeup brushes! They&#x27;re soft and always apply the makeup how I want. AND. . . they&#x27;re pink and girly like me:)</li>
    <li> love it small and cute for ur purse take it to go and its perfect for gifts yay took 3weeks fast</li>
    <li> Great for the price!!! I am a professional makeup artist and this is great for free gifts to clients or beginners.</li>
    <li> these brushes are soft and they do a great job blending colors. they are compact so u can take them anywhere!</li>
    <li> i do face paintings and this has the perfect little brushes for that! plus it&#x27;s super cute and super cheap, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> They are a  really good buy . Shipping took a little long but they came and where soo soft!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the set because for one, It looks bigger on the screen than in real life! Also, the brushes are hard to handle because they are too soft! I guess for the price it&#x27;s not that bad but it&#x27;s very cheap material, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this!</li>
    <li> Fell in love. All of the brushes were hear and it came in this cute little pouch . The bristles DO NOT fall off . They hold very well and are very soft</li>
    <li> i used them when i bought my bare minerals makeup and love it</li>
    <li> Nice set of brushes. Makes my application smoother and quicker with a variety of brush options the brushes and packaging are really cute too so that a plus. Great if you want to try a set of Brushes at a low price.</li>
    <li> would be a great gift for a lil girl</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are perfect for all makeup! They are a little smaller than I expected, but still, worked like a charm. Unlike some of my other makeup brushes, the bristles don&#x27;t fall out and they don&#x27;t fall off of the handles. They don&#x27;t mess up your makeup at all and they are similar to Mac quality. Maybe other people had bad experiences, but for this price, or even 2x or 3x more, they are amazing! I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I should have known for the price, but thought I could at least use them as backups, but no! These were coming apart when they arrived and the bristles feel like plastic. At least the carrying case is useful!</li>
    <li> I ordered these on June 25th and they just arrived a few minutes ago. The brushes are soft and not falling apart at all like other reviews have said. The case does smell a little but nothing a little perfume can&#x27;t fix. They&#x27;re a good size and quality for the price I paid for them!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! They are worth ten times more than they cost! I was expecting a strong smell and shedding because of reviews I read (that&#x27;s normal) but these are the first brushes I found that don&#x27;t shed! And I even tried at the brushes to pull excess loose hairs and not even one came out! Also, there was a small plastic smell when opening but it was not strong and went away after opening the case a few times! The brushes pick up makeup very well and blend well! If you wash them after use the color and softness should stay. I highly recommend these!!</li>
    <li> SO pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a makeup newby, and these really helped me get started.</li>
    <li> ive just recieved this and i have to say that these r really good ! And very cheap ! Everything came in just how it looked like in the picture . This took about 4 days to ship . i highly recomened this if ur looking for something  cute , cheap and good quality !</li>
    <li> When I first recevied these brushes I was very excited. When I opened it however, I noticed that on some of the brushes,the bristles were falling out. I&#x27;ve used the brushes and they are very good.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes !!!! Beauty!</li>
    <li> these brushes are ok.</li>
    <li> A+ Service and Product!</li>
    <li> Veryyy nice brushes for a good price!! Will order again</li>
    <li> they worked for a little while then all the tops of the brushes fell part!</li>
    <li> Cheap! You get what u pay for!</li>
    <li> I love these makeup brushes !!!! ♡</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for! My eyebrow broken was broken when I got it. Nothing super glue can&#x27;t fix;) other than that great!</li>
    <li> Good for the price, but it had a slight chemical smell.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome. I use mine everyday.</li>
    <li> I like the item it took like two weeks but it was worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought these on a whim because they were so cheap. I was not afraid to wait a little bit longer to receive them considering they are coming from an international shipper. They arrived about 2 weeks before the beginning of my estimated delivery window. They are so soft and fluffy. Absolutely wonderful for a beginning set of makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> super cute little wrap up bag this comes in. and the brushes are pefect size to fit in my little makeup case i love how they are pink also :)</li>
    <li> Best thing I ever bought on amazon! if I could give it 10 stars, I would.</li>
    <li> i just received my set of brushes and noticed that the purple part of one did not fit exactly with the white part, so i tried to adjust it and thats when it fell apart. i didn&#x27;t even get the chance to use it.. so then i started to check the rest of them the second one happened the same thing, and the rest were okay. i like the color but i guess i can;t expect much for so cheap.</li>
    <li> great brushes for a good value</li>
    <li> I really like the way my makeup goes on using the brushes. Great for the price</li>
    <li> You get better quality then what you pay for! They are super soft!</li>
    <li> Took a while to get here :/ but they seem good, the hairs don&#x27;t fall out and they&#x27;re very soft!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a bit hard, but u get what u pay for I guess. And btw one of the brushes broke like wtf</li>
    <li> Recieved on time, pretty colourful and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes and was pretty satisfied except for the bristles on one of the brushes randomly fell out. All the others are good though. They&#x27;re good quality brushes considering the price. Also, they took around a week and a half to come in.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for review and I&#x27;m so glad I bought two sets !!!  My daughter will love them !  These are super smooth and soft but effective enough to apply shadow under my eyes without all the shadow getting into my eyes !</li>
    <li> really good for the price!</li>
    <li> Not the best, not the worst. Worth the price and shipped in reasonable time.</li>
    <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t as soft. They are also not cut straight there was a lot of brissles that we&#x27;re sticking out. Also my carrying case had a huge hole in it.</li>
    <li> Love using these. Really nice case too. Will check out their other stuff</li>
    <li> Great value good for gift &amp; nice set</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like these to much I feel they don&#x27;t have enough bristles but they work alright I use them as a back up</li>
    <li> These brushes are so fluffy!  They are super soft. They came earlier than expected and are totally worth the money! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Hated the brushes so much, the hairs began to fell out the first day I used them. And the metal piece that connects the hairs to the stick was not placed well because it broke off after 3 days of use.</li>
    <li> The bag had a faint chemical smell and one of the brushes came apart , so I had to glue the two ends back together. Otherwise they are cute colored brushes and a good variety.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;m satisfied andI would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I ordered these FOREVER ago, and just got something COMPLETELY different in the mail the other day. I&#x27;m very disappointed and can&#x27;t figure out where to send them back or how to get my money back.</li>
    <li> Love These, i ordered more for Christmas gifts</li>
    <li> I use these brushes all the time, they&#x27;re very soft and beautiful. Good set for the price, very pink and kawaii.</li>
    <li> Great brushes, cheap but not made cheaply. The travel case is pretty but I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with the case.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing I love it</li>
    <li> These brushes are great, they have held up extremely well!</li>
    <li> I bought this about a month or 2 ago, and they are good quality brushes, but i didn&#x27;t care for some of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The whole cap ( brush, purple metal thing, etc) came off cause the glue or whatever so i have to stick them on when using them.&lt;br /&gt;But still good for tiny stuff in make-up.&lt;br /&gt;Def. get what you pay for,</li>
    <li> Cheap in both senses of the word. Brushes fall apart practically the minute they touch your face. Suppose I can superglue them, but not worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I have a teenage daughter who is getting makeup more perfected and this brush set was just what she needed to change the way she applies her makeup. It&#x27;s a cute set of quality materials and she couldn&#x27;t have been any happier. My daughter has been more of a tom-boy in the past, but this was just the little girly item she needed to start transforming into a beautiful young lady. I would totally recommend this item to others...it was well worth the money!! Hope everyone enjoys them just as much as she does. Shhhh, but I sneak and use them from time to time when I&#x27;ve misplaced my own...tee hee!</li>
    <li> Okay its understandable that the price is cheap so I was expecting a lower quality brushes, but definitely not such low quality. I just received the brushes last week and the two larger sized brushes are already bold, everything just fell out with two uses. Horrible quality, I&#x27;m disappointed!</li>
    <li> My package arrive just in time and I love my new brushes.</li>
    <li> I would NOT recommended this product. I know it is cheap but the brushes were falling apart. I would get some of the brush falling into my make up and stuck on my face. Dont waste your money the product WILL fall apart.</li>
    <li> Love them, there so cute and soft. The comb/brush help alot with my mascara.</li>
    <li> These are some of the best brushes I have received I love them! Buy them so cheap and good quality</li>
    <li> The pink is very bright with these brushes, and they work well with different types of makeup applications. Love them!</li>
    <li> Got these brushes way before the estimated arrival date ..like almost a week after ordering them ...the big one is super soft...one of the brushes lost a lot of bristles at first but still looks normal and such ...they are worth the 4$ they cost... Even a bit more ...I just got them to hold me over till I can afford some better ones ..which they will do just fine for ..I&#x27;ll prolly even keep them after I get better ones</li>
    <li> Nice set.  Took a long time to receive but worth it.</li>
    <li> These are great quality for the price! Received way earlier than actual estimaed delivery date.</li>
    <li> Love it! Brush is really soft, love the color</li>
    <li> Loved it!! Great price, great product...</li>
    <li> This fell apart as soon as it got here....-.- bad buy.. Poorly glued together..</li>
    <li> This works GREAT. The only downside is when you open it, it smells a tiny bit odd, but all you need to do is just let it air out overnight and they will be fine. BARELY sheds.</li>
    <li> I received these brushes and was not impressed, I only use two brushes out of them other than that the quality of these are very poor and I would not buy them again. The color is really the only thing these brushes have that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Looks nice  but is not good quality, could not use after a week or so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m providing feedback from my daughter, as I bought these for her and sent them to her at college.  I looked at the brushes but did not try them as they were for her.  She said the bristles immediately started falling out and that they seem very cheaply made, so she was not thrilled at all by these brushes.</li>
    <li> LOVEEE ! Super soft , arrived 2 weeks early</li>
    <li> Great brush set I&#x27;m enjoying using them</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! the first thing I thought when I got them was how cute they were! To be so cheap they actually work pretty great also so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
    <li> I really love the 8pcs Professional Cosmetic Makeup Brushes; not only are the brushes really pretty but they are also very soft and gentle on your skin! The bag is also really pretty and I love that I can put it in my purse in case I need any of the brushes while I&#x27;m out and about! I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> So soft and pretty. Going to order more for all the girls in my life :)</li>
    <li> The set is very nice but the eyebrow brush fell apart right away.</li>
    <li> I freaking love the brushes!!!!</li>
    <li> Its exactly seen online, new and a beautiful set...makes a great gift too!</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes in the mail today and I am super happy with my purchase! The package came in way earlier than i expected and the brushes are really good quality. Nothing was missing or broken I highly suggest you buy it the price, quality, and fast shipping are all reasons to buy it. I am a happy customer.</li>
    <li> not bad for a cheap set</li>
    <li> These are okay brushes but you get what you pay for. They barely pick up any product so I don&#x27;t even use any of them.</li>
    <li> One of the brushes came off but other than that I like it</li>
    <li> I love them only one strand came out of the brushes.</li>
    <li> DO NO BUY!! The brush was broken!!</li>
    <li> When I first got these brushes, I was very excited. They came in a cute pink carry case and they looked very nice with their hot pink tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the blush/powder brush holds hardly ANY powder. The other brushes don&#x27;t hold any pigment, either. I even had trouble with the lip brush. The eyebrow comb/brush combo wasn&#x27;t much better. You can&#x27;t really go wrong with the comb, but the brush irritated my skin under my brows. The bristles were very rough, more than my Ecotools one. My skin felt uncomfortable for a good hour after I first used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed. I don&#x27;t even use them because I think they&#x27;re so bad, and it wasn&#x27;t a good way to spend my money.</li>
    <li> Smell funny at first, and they stain rather easily, unfortunately, but hey, they&#x27;re light bristled brushes. Otherwise, they work very well; varied sizes are nice.</li>
    <li> This product was very poorly made. I soon as I opened them I see that one of the brushes is almost completely off of the handle. They shed quite a bit but they do stop after a while. The brushes do not pick up shadow well. You get a lot of shadow on the brush but that is usually where it stays... Some of the brushes are not very flexible and I had a hard time working with them. The only positive I have about them is that the case is really pretty</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Two week shipping and amazing for the price</li>
    <li> Ok. You get what you pay for. It does the job.</li>
    <li> The brush head broke off 3 brushes after a few applications . Very poor quality . The bag was very nice .</li>
    <li> Im never buying these kind of non working products,not recommended don&#x27;t throw ur money on these brushes u can just buy them at dollar tree they&#x27;re the cheap kind they dont work! :/</li>
    <li> This product was Ok. Not perfect the sponge fell off after a few uses and the paint started chipping. It was pretty good for the price though. Its not something Id give as a gift but for personal use to do some practicing with colors and what not.</li>
    <li> am a little early but bought for Christmas presents for 2 &amp;#34;girlie girls&amp;#34;  who will be very happy as I am with the sets.</li>
    <li> I did NOT get this I got some small nail brushes. Don&#x27;t buy! It&#x27;s a waste of money. I should have looked at reviews</li>
    <li> Great for a cute and inexpensive brush set, worth the long wait, and has all the main brushes you need. Not neccessarily high quality, but that&#x27;s not why I bought it.</li>
    <li> CHEAP,CHEAP,WEAK! I cannot even put on my blush with this it&#x27;s not strong enough to hold the makeup,regret it.Shoul have bought a different one.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! They&#x27;re so soft!</li>
    <li> well, the case is very cute</li>
    <li> Looks exactly like the picture, very cute! Arrived earlier than expected, very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> They feel very cheap and plastic I bought these just for practice and they feel very rough on my eyes..I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again...but I guess you get what you pay for very cheap brushes..</li>
    <li> These are gorgeous an I&#x27;m glad I bought them</li>
    <li> Just what i expect them to be.  Love them...</li>
    <li> This is a perfect example of you get what you paid for not worried about 4 bucks. They she&#x27;d easy. I bought two sets and gave one to my sister. Both sets fell apart soon after.</li>
    <li> My daughter love this brush set, had one that the brush fell off, but overall she was very happy with the set, small enough to put in her purse.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> They come apart at the stick area, had to glue them in.</li>
    <li> They are alright I suppose though the eye shadow brushes hold on to the shadow and the application is nil. Not worth it really.</li>
    <li> I really love the product . it looks juss like the picture and it shipped earlier than expected. I can&#x27;t wait to use my brushes. they are soo cute 😍</li>
    <li> Gift for my teenagers who is just exploring makeup! Pink is all that matters!</li>
    <li> Came earlier than expected which was great. Super cute and compact. Brushes are soft but super firm. Very good quality for the price!</li>
    <li> I have only good things to say about this set. The brushes I&#x27;ve used work great. The only reason why I&#x27;m giving it four starts instead of five is that the bag it comes with it is really cheap looking. Otherwise a great buy!</li>
    <li> Very hard to clean. One or two did break. Some of the brushes I did enjoy, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> good back up brush. I carry it in my car</li>
    <li> these brushes are terrible! when i got them they were all broken, and they do not hold eyeshadow well at all. I know its only 8$ but they are useless! oh, and they smell toxic</li>
    <li> So soft !! Not as great as name brand but worry buying until you can afford name brand..... Love my set!!</li>
    <li> Love them!! I ordered two so im waiting on the second one to arrive.</li>
    <li> The item was just as described and delivered on time!</li>
    <li> Just as I expected I love it . Perfect for travelers.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the Price. Arrived ahead of time. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love it, the only thing is that took forever but is just perfect</li>
    <li> The brushes were suprisingly okay.Great for there cheap price</li>
    <li> Perfect! It looks so pretty and I love the smell of something new. Great condition! I just love the pink tips!! x3 sad that it&#x27;s gonna mess it up 😔</li>
    <li> wayy to cheap lol i kinda new based on the price</li>
    <li> so cute and soft brushes</li>
    <li> Arrival was faster than expected. A brush was already broken before I got to use. Other than that I&#x27;m satisfied especially for the price .</li>
    <li> Brushes are generic. Too thin. Not thick enough for me.... Feel really cheap. I love the pink color and case it came in but couldn&#x27;t put them to good use. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my sis she loved them</li>
    <li> Wonderful for how cheap it is. I love my new brushes. I thought I would take them out of the pouch to keep them in my makeup bag but I don&#x27;t want to wear them out. Never thought about getting an eyebrow brush, but after trying it... HOW DID I EVER LIVE WITHOUT ONE!!! Very good for how cheap it is... Plus it&#x27;s pink!!!!!</li>
    <li> They are nice brushes, but one had the brush part not attached...  gave it as a present, so would have been better if one were not broken.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do my makeup often but they&#x27;re pretty.</li>
    <li> i like these brushes, the eyebrow brush came with missing hairs but customer service was amazing about it and sent me a new one. The brushes are soft but aren&#x27;t as soft as expensive brushes but still get the work done!</li>
    <li> Good little brushes for the price. They are not high end (obviously) but great for a travel set or as a gift to someone just starting to wear make up.</li>
    <li> I finally received this make up set, shipping was slow (almost a month) but definitely worth the wait! The brushes come in a perfect variety of sizes, especially the small straight edge ones when ur using loose powder eyeshadow &amp; need to apply a thin line. I just love these, soooooo worth the money!! 👍&lt;br /&gt; *Mary H</li>
    <li> Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> I love this brush set! Its cheap, and it works terrifically!  When I ordered it I didn&#x27;t expect it to be this good.(:</li>
    <li> I love the bag. The little overlapping feature holds pensils in its place. You can open and close it really easily and I especially like the design. So it is ideal for travel.&lt;br /&gt;The pensils came all in plastic cover which gave me as customer great confidence in using this product as far as sterilization goes. I am new to the world of using brushes and eye make-up so the price was ideal to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I am using the pensils and brushes daily now. Blending shades goes smoothly. They are easy to clean and I think are great for beginners. As far as the brush texture goes they are a bit stiff, but feel great on the face and follow the movement well with a bit of resistence. So far from the manufacturing side they hold all hairs of the brush together, so I think it is good quality. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> When I got my makeup package, I noticed the one brush was broken and it bothered me!! Besides that I got one broken, the brushes are really pretty and soft.</li>
    <li> Great price, I really liked!</li>
    <li> AMAZING quality for the price&lt;br /&gt;Hasn&#x27;t shed yet!!!!!</li>
    <li> i placed my order on august 9, it just got here today which is the august 26th. the brushes are over all, okay. There way better then what i had. when i opened the pink case the blending brush separated from the stick and i had to put it on back on there.not a good start. the only thing i just don&#x27;t like is how i couldn&#x27;t track it the whole time and even though its here it still says shipped and not delivered.</li>
    <li> So cute and cheap ! It came in faster than the delivery date ! And so cheap too ! I&#x27;m in love with these brushes. They are so small and cute that I can carry them everywhere I go !</li>
    <li> This is a really nice quality product . However, I was hoping to have more of diverse standard brushes for make up application ; blend brush , eyebrow shaper. I like it just fine for the cost and ordered more.</li>
    <li> I got this package of brushes before my delivery date, which impressed me but unfortunately the brushes are not worth the money. They are very cheaply made and do not apply the makeup well. They&#x27;re either to flimsy or too stiff.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes for costume make-up</li>
    <li> Good brushes for starters!</li>
    <li> The brushes break apart to easily.</li>
    <li> The brushes are really colorful and creative but they can be confusing for beginner makeup artist or everyday users. This pro kit should come with directions and info on each brush. I also noticed that when I clean the brushes or move the bristles of the brush in a fast motion the bristles come out, the bristles definitely need to be push in there tighter. Overall this is a great product just need a few improvements.</li>
    <li> the blushes are to weak, nothing like you describe, the big brush already fall apart, i wanted to take it put of the case and it felt apart, sorry i dont like them, the hair is plastic</li>
    <li> Smelled like paint, but everything else was as expected for the price!</li>
    <li> I love it!! Great product and shipped fast!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time! I love the pink case and use the brushes everyday! its a great deal especially when its good quality</li>
    <li> Quality is OK, but they smelled HORRIBLE when I received them.  Luckily a good washing and the smell eventually went away.  Other than that it is a great set for a beginner.  My daughter is enjoying them.</li>
    <li> GREAT BUY LOVE IT...........WILL BUY AGAIN......</li>
    <li> now this i do love and the price was right</li>
    <li> I got one for me and my younger sister, as she is starting to get into make up and I love the pink. I got it today, the brushes are soft, most are packed in and dense which i like. One problem is I was pulling mine out and removing the individual plastic sleeves and the top of the eyebrow brush came off in my hand. It doesn&#x27;t appear to have been glued on or anything. So I have to fix that and check my sisters set (meaning opening her Christmas present!) to make sure hers is ok!</li>
    <li> Because these brushes are very feminine and any female would be glad to get them as a gift.  I bought them for my daughter as a Christmas present.</li>
    <li> I loveeeeee these! The brushes are super soft and I couldn&#x27;t beat the price. Being a person who uses dark shadows most the pink is covered in the brushes but when they first came they were a beautiful bright pink. Also super easy to clean!</li>
    <li> amazing product great case awesome price things that i would get for $14 a brush i got for $3.50</li>
    <li> Littke hairs came off bad customer servislce -.-</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy these because of the price. I thought the quality would be horrendous! But I did just because I needed new brushes, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!! These brushes are so soft to the skin, and overall impeccable. Definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> I love them. Great product for such a low price</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re cute but they break really easily. I was using the blush brush and it came apart. I had just gotten them 4 hours before it broke lol but for the price it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> GREAT BRUSH set in a beautiful bag. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> did not like this product, eye shadow wont stay on the brush... bad quality, i guess its for littke girls</li>
    <li> I love these brushes they are everything I need for the perfect look. THANK YOU♥ I was so surprised to see how well they work!</li>
    <li> My brushes were stuck in the carrier and when I tried to gently wiggle them out, the tops popped right off leaving the handle stuck in the case.</li>
    <li> I loved when the product arrived. The brushes were so pretty and I love the color bag that it came in. The reason why I am only giving this product 2 stars is because when I pulled out the brow/last comb brush the brow and comb part literally fell out of the stick. I didn&#x27;t even get to use it. I just know next time I won&#x27;t order this product again. Pretty brushes but not very sturdy product to use.</li>
    <li> I love the bad that it comes in.  It&#x27;s cute and stylish.  I bought this for a friend with makeup.  It&#x27;s a cute little set. :-)</li>
    <li> This is the perfect set of brushes! This has the perfect brushes for eyes, cheeks and lips. Great set at an excellent price - and it just makes it that much better that they&#x27;re PINK! :)</li>
    <li> For the price the item is just what I wanted,I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.Love the color of the brushes however they are not really soft.</li>
    <li> smaller than i expected but the quality is great, the case smells kinda weird when it comes in but whatever</li>
    <li> these are great for the price. I use maybe 3/8 of these and on a daily basis. I didn&#x27;t like the little roller up package thing they came in, kinda pointless but these are very soft cute brushes.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes they are so cute and came in the mail very quick. It also has great quality for the price, they haven&#x27;t  fell apart like some have reviewed. Anyways, this is definitely a great buy.</li>
    <li> Theses brushes are really soft basically the only brushes you need I don&#x27;t even use some of them and I love pink which is why I got them</li>
    <li> Thier great , good quality and affordable price</li>
    <li> Brushes are of good quality and packaged in a wallet like case which is the best part, being in a case they never get dirty and can be arranged at one place, they are just good.</li>
    <li> These are some of the most flimsiest brushes I&#x27;ve ever seen! These will go to my 12 yr old daughter!</li>
    <li> I had a problem with the mail this company was very nice in resending the product to me and making sure I was happy. I am very happy with the service and the product.</li>
    <li> For the most part this set is decent. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I admit that the bag was kinda cute, but the brushes were okay, I am not complaining because compared the an expensive brush this brushes are okay for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like every thing fits in my bag it does not consume so much space and the pink color does make this easier to find. I have encounter any problems with this make up brush set which makes me happy. I am giving this a 5.</li>
    <li> Great set! Super soft! Very very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality of these brushes. They have so far, bypassed every expectation. I can create so many different looks and each one comes out beautiful and seamless. I would totally recommend for anyone!!!!!</li>
    <li> My cousin loves these, I bought them for her because she love putting on makeup and she always asked to have mine, they do the job and they don&#x27;t have any bad smell so they are great!</li>
    <li> Ehhhh it&#x27;s Verry nice for decorations but it just feels so cheap and I just don&#x27;t like the way any of the brushes work. We all have our opinions but hey , what doesn&#x27;t work for me could work for you ! (:</li>
    <li> Took forever to recieve but was a good price</li>
    <li> So i just recieved my new brushes. I kinda expected them to be a lil more professional. But hey what do expect when its free shipping and only $3. Right away i did notice thr big fat brush was kinda messy. I took it out and some of the bristles starting coming our. So in all they are okay for beginners or just for fun.Idk.  I just hope no more bristles start falling out. Ill give an update later if anything.</li>
    <li> Ok, but not very funcional, small pieces are the best...</li>
    <li> All of the brushes are great and the carrying case is very cute. I am not a professional makeup wearer or applicator so I don&#x27;t need brushes that are $20 a piece. These brushes seem to be of good quality and I am very happy with the price.</li>
    <li> Cool brushes , my daughter liked them a lot ,  good price and fast shipping, thanks</li>
    <li> The brushes were very little</li>
    <li> They were alright. I personally didnt like them i just gave them to my sister. They felt like they were to loose so i felt like they didnt apply anything well</li>
    <li> The brushes are awesome. 100x better than expected. Only problem is they are such a light color so they get dirty looking very fast.. my issue now is washing them. I wanted this color though but I wish  there was a better way to clean them.</li>
    <li> They work well, and I enjoy it</li>
    <li> This was some foolery brushes shed like crazy</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t really grab the make up, I should have gotten a better quality.</li>
    <li> Great deal. Shipping takes to long.</li>
    <li> Very happy thank yoou</li>
    <li> They weren&#x27;t the right color. They came pink instead of purple, but other then that they work fine and didn&#x27;t come broken</li>
    <li> The brushes are the worst. They do not come clean and the bristles move, not sure it&#x27;s suppose to do that.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive it. But there are some cons: the case smells like plastic a lot. Some brushes do fall apart after short use (within a month). I guess it is probably ok for the price.</li>
    <li> great!!!! so professional</li>
    <li> is good for learning make up.</li>
    <li> Great product! Can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price. The bristols are soft and work well with all of my makeup.</li>
    <li> High quality make up prices for a great price .</li>
    <li> Thank you came fast and was good for my daughter</li>
    <li> this set is awesome. it takes a little while to come (but keep in mind it is coming from China) but for me it did come before expected!!! the brushes are soft and definitely not a cheap quality. they didn&#x27;t shed at all and apply great. such a great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Great little set for the price.  Take off one point for the chemically smell of the case.</li>
    <li> Nice cheap makeup brush collection. I use most of these pieces daily and they have held up nicely. No annoying brush hair falling out and only one piece has broke but that&#x27;s probably me, I have horrible luck with eyebrow brushes breaking.</li>
    <li> I love them very soft</li>
    <li> received it even sooner than expected date! the brushes are really soft and adorable and worth the price. I love them!</li>
    <li> Came just like the photo. Brushes are not made out of this world nice but they&#x27;re not bad either</li>
    <li> I love all of the brushes, they are very soft but sturdy and dont break or fall apart!</li>
    <li> Nice selection of brushes for the beginner</li>
    <li> I bought about 4 of these and gave them as gifts. Everyone I gave it to loved it and uses it on a regular basis</li>
    <li> Although the time frame from order to actual delivery was slow, the product itself is quite nice and seems to be of good quality.  You cannot beat it for the price.  The retailer also was very courteous and prompt to respond to my shipping time-frame inquiry.  They promised it would arrive in a certain time period and they exceeded my expectation.  Nice set of brushes, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I see that a few others have commented about these brushes on a good level. I must have gotten rejects because as I started to use the first one all of the brush came out! I used a smaller one and it fell apart! This product is horrible and I want my money back!</li>
    <li> I payed for it and i still dont have it whats going on i payed twice</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok really soft I use them all except the blush brush it doesn&#x27;t cooperate that good</li>
    <li> they aren&#x27;t very good quality.. maybe they would be better for a child&#x27;s gift! I usually don&#x27;t complain much but the blush brush is really thin and one of the other brushes was broken when it arrived... I do love the way they look though!</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes, because I was always losing my make-up brushes or they would wear out. These are very good quality and come in a variety of sizes, so you have one for eye shadow, one for blush, one for face powder etc. Am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> these is a complete rip off...yeah it goes for the low low price of look for a different brush set. This is a terrible brand and the brushes are the lowest quality there will ever be. the brushes are breaking left and right...the brushes are dicolored from one another and the brushes shed like crazy!!! WARNING: DO NOT BUY IF SMART!!!</li>
    <li> These are really nice bridges, very soft and easy to use. My blush brush broke off the handle after junky a few days, but it was super easy to fix with superglue.</li>
    <li> I choose this 5 stars rating because it comes right on that day.&lt;br /&gt;I like this because its has a cool details on them and this is for my sister not for me.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to the make up artist and others</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes dont work or apply makeup as well. But for the price, it&#x27;s a good &#x27;backup&#x27; to turn to.</li>
    <li> i didnt get my pink case</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t the best quality, but, hey they&#x27;re a great deal for the price!</li>
    <li> brushes are nice, but mine came without leather bag, I ordered 4 or 5 for gifts, and now they are useless without the pink bags. I am very dissapointed</li>
    <li> As soon as I used one of the brushes, the whole brush part fell off of the stick. Not happy with this purchase at all.</li>
    <li> BRUSHES DIDNT COME WITH THE BAG</li>
    <li> Great stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> Really nice! The leather bag is cute, reason I&#x27;m giving 3 stars: the top of one of the brushes came loose. Other that that it was totally cute</li>
    <li> They were worth a try... but, as I had worried, they lose hairs too much.</li>
    <li> Cute, but mine fell apart before I even got to use them :-(</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even recieved it</li>
    <li> So as an aspiring makeup artist I am always looking for deals and when I do someone&#x27;s makeup I want to be professional as possible but on a budget and these brushes woud make me look like a 12 year old girl playing in makeup</li>
    <li> The brushes seem fine and the pouch is nice, but they have a somewhat strong smell of paint as soon as you unfold the pouch...</li>
    <li> Very cheap but for the price I should have known.</li>
    <li> This is a very cute and useful set of brushes. I love using the powder brush (the biggest brush) for contouring. All of the brushes work great! :)</li>
    <li> They are soft, but the bristles come off! And they barely have any bristles anyways! The carrier was cute but they aren&#x27;t really good. I only liked 2! I definitely don&#x27;t recommend these! I was told here, I was gonna get them for $5 but then they made me pay more! Don&#x27;t bye unless you want little sticks with no bristles. 👎</li>
    <li> The brushes ware off after a while. Kind of regret buying it. It isn&#x27;t great material but that&#x27;s what you get with the price.</li>
    <li> Super soft brushes. Includes a variety of sizes good for your everyday needs. Love the colors. Cute carrying pouch too. Metal tips are on firmly unlike some I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> I received it quickly than I expected! It came in beautifully! I loved the pink case and the pink tips of the bushes! It was so nice!</li>
    <li> The shipping was not too long, and I really love these brushes. For the price I would say these are downright amazing and I am soooo in love with the case. I did have one problem with the brushes. One of them had a bristle that was too long and I just found it really strange that I had to cut it myself. I&#x27;ve never had that issue with a makeup brush but that was just a minor thing. Other than that I&#x27;m so happy that I ordered these brushes!</li>
    <li> very nice different then your regular brushes</li>
    <li> These are nice brushes for the price but I have had nicer ones. But I paid a lot more for the good ones.</li>
    <li> i love this and it is my style and my daughter can even use these in the near future I LOVE THEM</li>
    <li> There easy to clean and they dont fall apart like other brushes. You get a great deal for a good quality brush and there not like 10$</li>
    <li> These brushes are AWSOME just what I was looking for!!!</li>
    <li> this item arrived FAST. the brushes are obviously synthectic, very soft; but if you don&#x27;t take care of them they will bend and crease easily. my bag was nice, though had obviously been a mess up. someone had sown it wrong, then took the stitching out, leaving dots in its place. I was only really disappointed with the size of the large brush. I thought it would be good for cover up, but its more for blush. also wish it came with a concealer brush. but over all,I would buy again</li>
    <li> The package arrived today much earlier then i expected brand new and packeged beautifully, also they are so soft! Im really excited cant wait to use them, did I mention their soft? And really cute the brushes also have a professional feel to it. I would recomend this to any girl crazy about makeup, and softness, though I thought the brushes would be bigger, but nevertheless they are amazing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent cheap brush set. Nothing special, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Do not get this. After recieving the makeup brushes..... i found out that the handles/stick part of the brushes were fused to the cloth case. When i tried to rip it out... they snapped</li>
    <li> I like 3 of the bridges in the set and the price was great recommended!</li>
    <li> I love it  is so  soft</li>
    <li> its alright for the price i cant complain but make sure u have crazy glue</li>
    <li> Omg this look literly a month to arrive they are much smaller than the pic but they are prettty and soft I guess over than the time it took to get here it was ok</li>
    <li> The bag had a heavy smell like paint thinner. It was so overbearing that I won&#x27;t touch the brushes to my face.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay. You get what you pay for. Uneven tips, fragile plastic and had glue on the handles. Very soft though.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup kit! Pink and so cute with it&#x27;s case.. I wish I would have ordered more and given them as presents.. I will definitely be ordering more in the future..</li>
    <li> Price was excellence,love the packaging ,brush are very beautiful..Travel with brushes easy and lt.weight.Very womanly brushes,to use..the closure work well</li>
    <li> Cute set...great gift!</li>
    <li> Recommend these brushes 100% they work great no wierd smell no shedding there simply awsome</li>
    <li> i did not like them but thats what you get for $3 bucks.</li>
    <li> The quality of these brushes is not that great but I guess they are OK for the price</li>
    <li> Love my new makeup brushes, and they come in a nice case.</li>
    <li> Very nice make up brush set. Very cute case, also.</li>
    <li> I just love these. Now I am going to get a bigger set but these are so perfect for those that want the basic brushes. and shipping so fast i was impressed. I love them.</li>
    <li> These have worked very well for me and pack so easily when you&#x27;re on the go! Just be gentle when cleaning to avoid any heads flying off!</li>
    <li> The makeup sponge and the eyebrow/eyelash brush both came off of their sticks. Cheap. Not okay.</li>
    <li> I love my brushes and the case it comes in. What you see in the pic is what you get. They&#x27;re durable and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Check out the make up brush set in my video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;vhcJFMOCLCI</li>
    <li> Good buy, just took long to get here</li>
    <li> Excellent price on an excellent product. I didn&#x27;t LOVE the bag but I knew that before I got it and wasn&#x27;t concerned. The quality of the brushes is great, and very similar to some of my designer brushes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find these brushes for a reasonable price.Beautiful, soft and pink...</li>
    <li> recieved product in a timely manner. so for no issues with the brushes</li>
    <li> I love the brushes. They&#x27;re my favorite color and I love the softness.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re fine. I love the color of the brushes, a bit small so I&#x27;ll be using these for when we travel. Sort of stiff yet soft enough.</li>
    <li> So far I have been very happy with my brushes. The cost was in my price range an I love the  color.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. Def not good quality</li>
    <li> They are okay, flimsy.</li>
    <li> I was impressed on how soft the bristles were. It made applying make-up smoother. Very &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34; product</li>
    <li> These brushes are cute.  I&#x27;ve used them for a couple weeks and they are holding up.  Three stars though, because I did not get a pink case.  They just came wrapped in cellophane.  Price was still good, but product follow through was not.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re nice and sturdy. I like them.</li>
    <li> This product is great! They have a nice color and work very well. I definitely recomend this product!</li>
    <li> Came timely. Just as I expected.</li>
    <li> I loved my brushes the pouch is so cute. I will be buying again for $4 bucks cant beat that.</li>
    <li> Wonderful set of brushes at an unbeatable price.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it, the brushes, the case and the color.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set of brushes.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I received the two sets in purchased in cheap plastic bags with no brush bag to be found!!!</li>
    <li> Made the purchase of the product&lt;br /&gt;and he did not send</li>
    <li> Took awhile to get them, but their great :) Thanks</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, i haven&#x27;t  used  them yet because  they are so pretty.  Thats one of the reasons why. I just  haven&#x27;t  gotten  the  chance  to  use them yet. Only  reason  why i didn&#x27;t  give it 5 stars is because  the eyeshadow  applicator  fell  of. I dont use them anyway but still.  Other than that  they are great</li>
    <li> Brushes are definitely beginner brushes. Nice and compact, very cute. Smell doesn&#x27;t bother me much. Cheap and worth the price. Shipping took at least a month. Nothing broken and no shedding.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush set, it fits perfect in my purse and it was a pretty good price. (:</li>
    <li> So I bought these, they came in a pretty case that caught my attention... But some of the tips to the brushes came off immediately...I like the colors though, the brushes could have been more softer... I think I paid too much</li>
    <li> Expected good after reading reviews but is disappointing.. Will not recommend this. One of the cheap Chinese products. Also was very disappointed to know it was made of goat&#x27;s hair. Will buy a synthetic cruelty free product from next time. Don&#x27;t want an animal to be sacrificed for my makeup</li>
    <li> Good for the price but the bristles fall off easily</li>
    <li> The bristles have started coming off and the metal part is getting detatched from most brushes. They do work well and blend well.</li>
    <li> Ok for price you can expect more ...</li>
    <li> Beautiful and professional! I love the case!</li>
    <li> I literally threw it in the trash the first day I got it . I used it on myself and my sister and just so much of the brushes hair was falling off each application. Strongly do not suggest this product .</li>
    <li> This product you get what you pay for.  Very course brushes which don&#x27;t hold any product on them to use.</li>
    <li> These fell great on your skin, they are so soft. Great bargin for this material. I will be using these forever.</li>
    <li> Really soft &amp; cute! Some of the hair on the blush brush is sticking out but still works! I like it so far!</li>
    <li> overall they were great they just don&#x27;t apply as well as I want them to but not for an everyday use</li>
    <li> These have become my all time favorite brushes for applying any makeup. Im so glad that I bought them.I went from using one eye shadow applicator that u always get with eye shadow to these brushes make everything fun to wanna wake up in the morning and put makeup on!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re so soft! I love the the color and texture. The pink case is adorable.  The brushes are good quality and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Okay so im cheap and i was looking for brushes and I am just like WOW. So I ordered them in Nov 24 and I saw when they were coming and it was going to come in Jan 13! So I finally get them and I&#x27;m sooo excited to finally use them. Well I get some color on a brush and put it on my face. All the sudden I couldn&#x27;t feel the hair... IT FELL OUT.... Don&#x27;t get them!</li>
    <li> Very nice packaging, came with pouch just as advertised, only reason for 4 stars is that they are smaller than expected, but really don&#x27;t bother me .. Bristles feel very soft.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get these make up brushes! They work great and our of good qaulity! Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> they stink but I like em it took them forever to get here but they made it thanks again for them</li>
    <li> I bought these as a present for my teen sister. She really loved them. She gets really good compliments on the brushes from her friends. I really recommend these. Theyre cute and perfect for a your girl.  Overall im pleased with the purchase</li>
    <li> Great product to use makeup with. If you have a sister of somebody that likes to take your things you can tell what&#x27;s missing. The only problem is the packing messed up my brushes</li>
    <li> I was really surprised at the quality of this product.  I had been pricing make up brushes and found them to be very expensive.  I thought I would take a chance on this kit since it was extremely low priced.  You definitely get a good deal in this product.</li>
    <li> This product was so so. I used it only five times before it started to fall apart. When i first got it, there was a horrible odor which made feel like grossed out. Overall, i would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They are soft and the bristles don&#x27;t hurt my face. A plus, the color is cute. They are perfect for travel</li>
    <li> For the price, good buy. They smell strongly like nail polish remover and took a very long time, but what do you expect? I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed with how good these brushes are for a couple bucks!</li>
    <li> Super soft Brushes! They smelled a little but I think that by airing them out they will be fine! :)</li>
    <li> This set of brushes are really good for the price</li>
    <li> So I ordered the 8 piece set fell in love with the pictures and the color was looking toward to them.... But instead of getting what I paid for I received 6 nail brushes, I&#x27;m very upset!!! This is the last time I order anything from this company!</li>
    <li> Love them!!! Great quality.</li>
    <li> half of them are good but the other half are terrible and they dont really pick up makeup at all.</li>
    <li> I love them!!! The hair of the brush doesn&#x27;t fall out!!! It&#x27;s perfect!! I loved all the brushes!!!</li>
    <li> The bristles look and feel great. The brushes smell wonderful and they arrived two weeks before the expected arrival date. They are coming from China. I did notice that the bag had a small opening due to small fabric not being sewn-over but for the price I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything to complain about. I&#x27;ve had Americal Apparel clothing with worth stitch lines. As for the brush themselves I found the metal well glued.</li>
    <li> Ok so I bought these a couple days ago. After seeing all the great reviews. I CANT WAIT TO GET MINE!!!:-)</li>
    <li> Weren&#x27;t as good as they look in the picture and I got them really late</li>
    <li> Very nice. Just wish the brushes had lables on them for their uses for the beginner.</li>
    <li> I bought this makeup brushes because of there price. They are so cheap and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on makeup brushes. They came within a week and I&#x27;ve used a few of them especially the angle brush. They work perfectly fine for me and they&#x27;re really cheap so why not get them!</li>
    <li> I recently just got into make up and learning what brushes do what. Buying this was a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;I love the pink color too.&lt;br /&gt;Super cute&lt;br /&gt;The case it comes in is nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier :)</li>
    <li> The two big ones worked great but the the three smallest ones snapped. I would not rec. these brushes. they are not great!</li>
    <li> The brushes worked alright, but were very hard to clean.  They also came apart every time I used them, so I had to super glue them together.</li>
    <li> I love my new makeup brushes, it has soft hair and it easy to use. I love the pink tip it has on it and its so easy to clean them back to that same color.</li>
    <li> gifts for granddaughters.  they loved it.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These brushes are not very good because the &#x27;hair&#x27; in it falls out easily, and it all falls apart super easy.</li>
    <li> I love this product,super easy to use.</li>
    <li> These brushes ended up being adorable, and pretty good quality as well. The little casing they come in isn&#x27;t fantastic, but it holds it all together and is still cute as well. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good amount of brushes for a good price.</li>
    <li> Arrive ahead of time happy about that and brushes are soft and very pretty nothing was broken excited to test them out !</li>
    <li> It was not at all was I was expecting.  I would say it is travel size.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really come with all the pieces shown in the picture. It&#x27;s missing to items</li>
    <li> Was pretty surprised with the shipping in this product. It came pretty fast considering where it came from. I love the pink case and how it ties and how the brushes are pink. The smell is very strong like that new smell which I&#x27;m sure will ware off with time. The bristles are soft and apply very well. I&#x27;d say these are overall pretty decent brushes for the price.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping versus a be so good as it was only three dollars but I recommended Buy it</li>
    <li> First it took so long to get ( didn&#x27;t realize it ships from China); second it smelled horrible; third when I did begin using them I had multiple issues with styes and finally had an infection bad enough that I had to receive IV antibiotics. I&#x27;m not saying the product is what caused it but I never have infections like that or staph infections and suddenly began having them when I started using these. I am throwing these away.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality for the price</li>
    <li> They are gorgeous as hell... But they suck! They are in two by the minute you take them out! The hair in the brushes is all around the face once you aRe TRYING to put the make up on......</li>
    <li> Brushes are great will buy more of these</li>
    <li> great for a beginner but eventually an upgrade will be necessary</li>
    <li> Brushes are tiny and fall apart easily.</li>
    <li> Like it!! Ordered 4 more!! I&#x27;ll do bussines again!!</li>
    <li> Use everyday.  Soft brushes  Blend well.  Orders several more because the price is so good.</li>
    <li> I love my makeup brushes! Everything about this set is wonderful.</li>
    <li> It did its job...  for a short while. Although they were soft and held the product well, the brushes started to fray and then lose hairs after being used only a few times. Then the brushes themselves simply detatched from the handles after just a few weeks. The bag it comes it was poorly made. The ties fell off after a few uses and the linings started to come off as well. Will not buy again, I recommend you keep looking.</li>
    <li> The first day I got the came off the stick I was really disappointed but it&#x27;s good tho</li>
    <li> I have bought numerous of these.  Be sure to purchase months in advance because it does take forever for it to get here.  Still it&#x27;s a nice gift for young children.</li>
    <li> Great product and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> These are really cute.  we ordered for my daughters friends birthday - so they are being used by a child.  perfect price for a little starter set of play make up:)</li>
    <li> I bought these for myself and love them so much, I&#x27;m going to get more for christmas gifts. The brushes are soft, the makeup goes on well and the bag is cute and convenient.</li>
    <li> I should have my granddaughter here to write this review cause they were for her, i know she hasn&#x27;t complained about them so I find that a good thing.</li>
    <li> Got these for my niece and she really seemed to enjoy.</li>
    <li> Best brushes I&#x27;ve ever had!!</li>
    <li> Very soft handles are cheap case is a nice touch it rolls up nice and small to throw in your overnight bag or even purse</li>
    <li> I love the brushes especially the big one it Is so soft and the others are amazing and no bristles fall out,and I can&#x27;t believe the price.😀💵</li>
    <li> I love this brush set.. I use it everyday. and was very affordable..</li>
    <li> Nice makeup brush set.</li>
    <li> Great brush set!  I used these for a trip and they were just the perfect set!</li>
    <li> They are very good quality products and satisfy my needs, I always arrive on time and there has never been any problem so buy on amazon. by&lt;br /&gt;security and guarantee.</li>
    <li> great gift item for my clients</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for what you pay.</li>
    <li> they are cute. and useful I love them. its nice if you just need some brushes, not a whole kit</li>
    <li> Wrong product!&lt;br /&gt;I order this &amp; got 3 iPhone chargers instead!???? I really am need a refund!</li>
    <li> Since I purchased this set, I have not really broke it in yet.  It seems as if they are durable because I have pulled on the fibers and none have shed.</li>
    <li> Brushes are good but a little stiff but they are good</li>
    <li> these brushes sucks save your dollars</li>
    <li> Received this about a week ago and one of the brushes broke already I guess when purchasing something like this u do get what u paid for but I wasn&#x27;t doing anything I shouldn&#x27;t and it just snapped.</li>
    <li> I love these! Just got them today! They&#x27;re exactly like the picture and are just so soft and great!!! I love them</li>
    <li> I was surprised . I really like these brushes they are very soft. I would recommend these and you can use for a travel that&#x27;s what I use them for.</li>
    <li> They are so soft and pretty I didn&#x27;t want to use them at first, but they work great. I love them</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes back in October. I actually really enjoyed them. There are a few of them I really don&#x27;t have use for because I already had that type of brush. They are extremely soft, so If you like firmer brushes these aren&#x27;t for you. I have read some reviews saying how they don&#x27;t want to come clean. I do a brush shampoo every month or so and these seem to come clean fine. I use 1 part olive oil and 1 part dish soap. Then rinse under water. Over all good buy for how cheap they are. :)</li>
    <li> Great gift set. It was adorable! Looks well made and I was very impressed when I got it. I expected it to look much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Im not a makeup professional but these brushes are made with great quality! It was worth the wait and price :)</li>
    <li> product is what they say it to be i use it nearly everyday and it is great awesome product i love it</li>
    <li> It came in a timely manner.Its very pretty and useful.A great gift for young women.It has everything you need to apply make-up.</li>
    <li> At 1st i was kinda ify about buying them , after i had got them though i used them right away . They are great and a cheap buy . If your thinking about buying new makeup brushes be sure to pick these up !(: fast shipping too ! They give you like a airbrush look . They hold up well too even thur washes !(: i will buy again</li>
    <li> I give 4 stars for these brushes!I must say that this is a very good brand of brushes. No shedding at all even after washing my brushes!</li>
    <li> Its awesome... ! i love it..&lt;br /&gt;its good for traveling and its soft and works really good.... &amp;#60;3 just love it!</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes. Have gotten lots of usage out of them. Glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> I notise that the hairs were coming off from the brushes that really turned me off. Also one of my brushes craked.!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she really liked them. One of them had dust (powder? makeup?) which was weird but she washed it and it was fine. The larger brush did start losing some bristles but my wife didn&#x27;t complain much about it so i guess it was fine especially for the price. Also, it was delivered in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as an add on item, and was amazed at the product.  As is expected with any brush that you purchase and use, a FEW bristles will fall out but these are honestly the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have not had any problems with them, they feel great and I have had more than one person asking where I got them.  Each brush has worked perfectly and allowed me to do the makeup I want to.  I am so pleased with this product, would refer to everyone.</li>
    <li> Brushes are great for a beginner but the brissels are too soft. My daughter uses them and she is happy with them but she is 14</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister for Christmas, it came a little late, but she absolutely loves them! It was a great selection(:</li>
    <li> The brushes seem a bit rough, so I don&#x27;t use the eyeshadow applicator, I only use the eyebrow brush and the blush brushes.</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are right for the price. They took about 2 months to get here. They are very cute but are very cheap. The heads fall off and bristles fall out occasionally but the case is cute. You get what you pay for. I don&#x27;t think I would recommend these for a professional but would work great for a pre teen.</li>
    <li> Great price for great product.&lt;br /&gt;Super soft brushes no complaints for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Comes in the pink bag, purple brushes, would buy from again</li>
    <li> Cute, works great, the bag is a little weird. It doesn&#x27;t say anything. It&#x27;s just random letters.</li>
    <li> Very good so far. Nothing fell apart or anything and for their price this is a very good deal. But I didn&#x27;t get a receipt</li>
    <li> There nice but it has a nasty smell but it goes away I like the color  and there cute 😃</li>
    <li> These brushes are very firm and great for makeup! Although 2 of them lose some of the brush parts which is annoying when putting makeup on.</li>
    <li> good makeup for my girl</li>
    <li> The tween that received them especially liked them because of the pink. I didn&#x27;t actually get to see them up close but she loved them. Good for a teenager or tween.</li>
    <li> Came earlier than expected an was not damaged! Great product  for beginners like me!</li>
    <li> Love this! They are beautiful and I&#x27;ve had so many friends ask me where to buy! Ive had them about a year and haven&#x27;t used them because they are too pretty lol</li>
    <li> love it!!!!!!! the brushes are amazing,and i love that they are so soft.seriously the best brushes ive ever bought.plan to buy more in the future.and very speedy shipping!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are really pretty and the bristles are super soft. However, two of the brushes broke right after I took them out of the box. It wasn&#x27;t a huge deal I just super-glued the brush heads back on and all is well. Still not cool to have them break straight away though so I give these a 3</li>
    <li> They apply make up very smoothly. Pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Great little brush bag for it&#x27;s price! Absolutely love it. Looks like displayed on picture, honestly surprised of how nice it is.</li>
    <li> I think people complain way to much about these! They do not fall apart. I even grabbed a hold of the metal parts and yanked a few times to see if they would come apart like some people said. They did not, the hold was very strong. The tips were super soft and the bristles didn&#x27;t fall out when applying my make up. Honestly their better than 95% of the expensive brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. And they are just adorable! The metal parts really are pink, but a flash of light makes them look purple (I.E. The camera flash when a picture is taken) I would recommend these to anyone!</li>
    <li> The powder brush is not good at applying</li>
    <li> This product is good and very useful and came on time.  I love the color and that it fades in the brush.</li>
    <li> came as expected &amp; way faster than shipment date. took about a week.</li>
    <li> These brushes smell like paint!  I thought it was just the case they came in but I left them on my bathroom counter to air out and 3 days later my whole bathroom stinks like fresh paint.  They would be great if they didn&#x27;t smell so bad.</li>
    <li> They are cute and they work for what they are used for- no complaints here. :) Only a four because the bristles aren&#x27;t in too great of shape.</li>
    <li> Love them and the price was right.</li>
    <li> This is so cute and it came fast love the brushes and the pink holder is stylish. Great purchase with this one.</li>
    <li> Love all the brushes use them a bunch to blend in my makeup</li>
    <li> These brushes started to fall apart once I had cleaned them. But they were ok brushes. I wish I didn&#x27;t get them.</li>
    <li> Love! I have used almost daily since buying</li>
    <li> Very cheap quality...worth the little bit you pay for. The top part came off after the first week of having them. Great for children though.</li>
    <li> The foundation brush is sooooo small.</li>
    <li> This brush set is good just a bit short ..but they work perfect ..what I like the most is the price they are really cheap ..also there really soft</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this set! The brushes are soft and hold well, well made.</li>
    <li> Good brushes but not the best.  Packaging is cute but not high end but great brushes for the price point.</li>
    <li> They work but they are bad brushes</li>
    <li> Not good quality. I do not like them nor do I suggest anyone by them</li>
    <li> They arrived in awesome condition! They&#x27;re so soft and cute and pink and I love them so much !!</li>
    <li> Cheap but I love them. I honestly can not tell the difference from this set and a set of brushes that cost $50+. I love them and use them everyday</li>
    <li> These brushes are definitely cheap and poorly made. The bristles are hard/scratchy. You definitely get what you pay for in terms of makeup brushes. Spend a little extra money and invest in good brushes that will last you a lifetime!</li>
    <li> Okay, so this is a good buy for the price. I was only disappointed by the size of the blush brush as it isn&#x27;t very big. On the positive side, the case is lovely and the brush bristles are very soft. This is definitely worthwhile to purchase as a starter brush set; however, I would not recommend this product as a professional brush set.</li>
    <li> The bag is made great.For the price you can try the brushes, wont replace the set you already have but might give you back up</li>
    <li> Amazing!! Worth way more then what I paid. Thinking of buying more for family members. Would definitely be a great gift</li>
    <li> I love it is what I expected from it</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of the price and the color, I only needed two of the brushes so I figured this set was perfect. They arrived quickly and they do they job well done. The big blush brush is super soft and grabs the powder right. I&#x27;ve already washed them and nothing happened to them, they are great.</li>
    <li> I got my brushes in due time and they&#x27;re so pretty and work so good! I La La Lovvvee It!</li>
    <li> Recieved these brushes really fast.  I just dont if I should use them or not, they have this really unusaul and horrible smell.  Seems like what ever is on them that stinks would cause acne</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Affordable price&lt;br /&gt;-Brushes are incredibly soft and gentle on skin&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with a cute case to keep them stored in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The only issue I had with this product was that the case (though not the brushes) had this plastic smell to it. It wasn&#x27;t incredibly overwhelming but it was noticeable. Taking the brushes out and giving the case a good wash should be enough to get rid of it, though.</li>
    <li> It was totally perfect for the teenager that it was bought for,, she loves it and use&#x27;s it almost every day</li>
    <li> the top of the brushes come off the stick after the first use. We had to re-glue half of the brush tops to the stick to even use these.Spend a little extra and buy professional type brushes.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes and the little case it comes with, but unfortunately once I started to use one of the brushes the brissels started to come out with each stroke, so I had to buy a replacement brush from elsewhere. Other than that ONE brush that was bare after the first use, the rest of the brushes work amazingly</li>
    <li> Brushes are soft and the holder is nice. I like that there is a brush for everything including an eyebrow brush</li>
    <li> The price is great and the brushes work well there awfly soft but its what I expected since they where Cheap the bag works great I carry it in my purse I saves so much space. the brushes are a small size too so don&#x27;t a expect a tyical brush size.</li>
    <li> They are lovely and soft! They look just like it&#x27;s pictured on here. Good quality brushes too! You should buy this :)</li>
    <li> I received the brushes a few days ago. They are of great quality, and at such a great price. The only brush I am not 100% enthralled with is the blush brush. It&#x27;s a little smaller than I&#x27;m used to. It does however work great for veil powders. I love these brushes and way less expensive than buying them in stores.</li>
    <li> I love the way they look there so girly and pink but don&#x27;t expect regular size these are more travel size.. They did arrive really quickly and the smell is not as bad as everyone is saying either. In my opinion i won&#x27;t be buying again but for the price they are a great gift for smaller girls or beginners.</li>
    <li> The brush set is very nice and I like the blended color that it has.  I would recommend it if you just need a simple brush set</li>
    <li> The 8pcs Pro Pink Make up Brushes Set with Case that I ordered arrived very quickly and just as described. I am thrilled with my purchase..!</li>
    <li> Nice and affordable but the brush strings fall out when applying makeup</li>
    <li> The powder brush was hard to blend and shred like crazy.</li>
    <li> Good choice as a gift.</li>
    <li> Really like these brushes, the bristles aren&#x27;t rough and doesn&#x27;t make any harsh lines when applying makeup. The brushes are bit smaller than expected but who really cares for that price. Shipment was fast, definitely a good travel brush set!</li>
    <li> hmm where do i strat verry bad quality smh i got it on time a lil before time and for nothing couse the brushes ar bad its not soft and the brush that i really needed actually came broken i didnt even have to pull it out when i went to gi grab it it just fell apart i meant i guess if you wanna use it for a day and thats it you should get them but if they are for a long term use pls dont waste your money</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!  I like these brushes for the price...I like the case I can keep all of them together yeah it kind of smelled like plastic...but the smell didn&#x27;t stick forever. They are soft that&#x27;s what I like and the bristles don&#x27;t shed everywhere def plus I would buy again for sure....U should too</li>
    <li> really gud at a cheap price</li>
    <li> They were very strong no hairs have ever fallen out they don&#x27;t shed either the only reason there missing a star is because i don&#x27;t like the plastic handles if only they were metal or wood</li>
    <li> Love these and for how cheap it was a kinda long wait for shipping because it&#x27;s from China but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> SO soft and girly. They are perfect and the brush hairs DO NOT fall out. Very firm and cute!</li>
    <li> Excellent package, excellent quality of brushes, very cute to the eye</li>
    <li> nice brushes would order again</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes a few months back. When I first opened them up two of the brushes heads came off, they were loose. I still have them but I don&#x27;t ever use them. They are flimsy Brushes. I just didn&#x27;t want to deal with returning them.</li>
    <li> This product is ok, it comes with the date like it says, but the brushes fall apart, meaning where the purple part is and the white stick fall apart instantly. Other than that its awesome!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are simple. However it&#x27;s great for the price!</li>
    <li> Would have been nicer if all the brushes weren&#x27;t small. But still cute and the brushes are great.</li>
    <li> Great product. These are such pretty and soft makeup brushes. i really like them This is as described in the description.</li>
    <li> They arrived fast, they smelled a bit but it was just the smell of new plastic of the case it came in so I just left it open and aired it out for a day or two and the smell went away. The brushes are of good quality and very soft. They don&#x27;t shed either when being washed or when used with make up and are easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I really like  and recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She used them for prom and her make up came out great.  The are soft and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> For he price you pay as everyone says you get what you pay for don&#x27;t get me wrong they get the job done it just takes long finish it and they have this strong chemical order bought for my niece to play with had to wash twice before she used them to get the smell off and they still smelled 😔 oh we&#x27;ll but she loves the color and she&#x27;s happy with them so I guess they&#x27;re not so bad</li>
    <li> The set just came today, my eastimated day was June 19th but they came 3 days early! I was shocked!!! I have already tried it out and I had read some reviews that said the brushes broke and blah blah blah, well mine wasn&#x27;t! They work perfectly! Some people say they didn&#x27;t like the bag because it was cheap, well people it was $4.00! What do you expect????? I love it all and will be buying moreeeee!!!!! Great product you guys!!!!!</li>
    <li> While these brushes serve their purpose, the connector tips (where the metal connects to the brush itself) come off easily. Highly disappointed, but some of the brushes are still going strong.</li>
    <li> so loving the colors and i have yet to learn whitch brush is for what. cant wait to actually use it</li>
    <li> I love the color of the product. This was packaged well and shipped within a reasonable amount of time. I have used only a few of the brushes several times. So far, no bristles have been falling out. Also, it is a good size to keep in a purse.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted!!!!! Everything was on point and I was completely satisfied with the great service provided</li>
    <li> I got a great price on the product and the display pictures shows off the product very well. I would suggest this as a gift, travel make up brushed, grab bag gift, or for yourself. It&#x27;s a great way to have essential make up brushes in a cute travel size available at your finger tips, and cute color too.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. First time I used 1 of the brushes it came apart</li>
    <li> I love this item! It is great because it could fit in my purse! I love the color pink!</li>
    <li> They were okay I don&#x27;t recommend them though  they broke easily.</li>
    <li> I just got it today and I like it so far</li>
    <li> i do not like pink but good quality item would buy again if i need them so i do like them</li>
    <li> i love this set. it was a gift for my friend and she loves it. great price too. the item arrived promptly and in great condition.</li>
    <li> This was a bargain and the brushes are all sturdy. I will say that the brushes are mostly useful for eye liner and making your eyeshadow your eyeliner. I find it difficult or lengthy in time to apply the shadow to my whole eyelid because the brushes are pretty flat. The larger brush is great for powder blushes because it lightly puts it on, it doesn&#x27;t leave a thick clump of color on your cheeks. The other brush for your eyebrows and lashes is practical as well. I don&#x27;t feel like these brushes will fall apart any time soon.</li>
    <li> theyre allright....they dont pick up as much of the makeup and i would like but what can you expect</li>
    <li> Another Christmas present for our daughter. She loves this. She really likes the big one. I am a man, so I cannot personally comment on the quality, but she is very happy.</li>
    <li> Great price, arrived quickly, nice quality. Very happy with this product. The case is a nice quality as well. Very happy overall.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my stylish 13 year old. She loved the gift. However, the tops are already coming apart. We super glued them so hopefully they will hold out a little longer.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft.  I love how nice the edges are.  My eyes have never looker better.  I would buy these again and for the price they are a steal</li>
    <li> Look kind of fake but they are ok., a couple broke and they are really hard to clean. Other then that for the price they are great !</li>
    <li> These brushes are so cute and soft! These are my first real cosmetic brushes and I love using these. They also came on the first estimated arrival date so that was nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give 4 stars is because the eyeshadow applying brush/sponge/thing feels like it could come loose if your not a little careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, great set! Very happy with this purchase, would totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect and was accurate . the info was true and not false. Case was needed and the comfort was delightful.</li>
    <li> the 8pcs Pro Pink Make up Brushes Set with Case  its ok and very usefull...........8pcs Pro Pink Make up Brushes Set with Case  ......................</li>
    <li> having you ZZZ yet I&#x27;ve been waiting so that way when I get all my makeup I can try everything out and I will be doing a video on that....</li>
    <li> I gave 5 stars because of the price, really great for what you get, and I do like the pink case. Also because this is my first makeup brush set ever, (except some single brushes or what comes with makeup when I buy) so I have nothing to compare it too :) I used it twice sincce I just got a few days ago and so far so good. No bristles falling out yet...  glad I bought, useful for my makeup needs, mostly eye shadow. Would buy again. Like tying it up and tossing it in my makeup bag. As pictured.</li>
    <li> Cute case and the brushes are very soft.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and great customer service.</li>
    <li> They came just as I thought they would. The brushes are soft. It&#x27;s a very good product if your looking for some new brushes.</li>
    <li> I received this, and gave it as gift and they love it  its large enough and very handy to use.</li>
    <li> Love the pink/white color of the brushes.  The powder brush has soft bristles. They wash well. Each brush performs well for basic application of makeup. Makes a great travel brush set or to put in your makeup bag in your purse for touch ups. Very inexpensive. No complaints, only satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Love them :) still useing them!! Don&#x27;t shed AT ALL! but the bigger powder brush broke of the stick but shoot for the price it&#x27;s a complete STEAL!!!</li>
    <li> I gave this item 5 perfect stars because it was worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;The color is so perfectly pink.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are super soft.&lt;br /&gt;The bag is cute.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality for a great low price!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Since the brushes are white and light pink I would try to clean them after every use.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review was a bit helpful!!! If not then continue browsing through different brush sets and hopefully you find something you will love :)</li>
    <li> The brushes themselves are very soft...and the package arrived way before it was scheduled to, so props on that...haven&#x27;t even got a chance to use the brushes for makeup yet, but I&#x27;ve been playing with them for like an hour now. Will buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> love this very nice this comes in a very nice case love all the brushes they are sooooo nice thank&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Overall, I was pleased with how good these brushes were, until one the top piece to one of my flat brushes came off. If this had not happened, I would&#x27;ve given this product 5 stars, since the brushes work nice, and are easy to store away. Fortunately, none of the hairs to any of the brushes have fallen out yet, which is always good! I do recommend these brushes to anyone who wants professional-like brushes, without having to pay a lot of money for them.</li>
    <li> Awesome for the price!</li>
    <li> Very Upset About How Easily The Bristles Come Out The Brush Very Easily.... Pretty Color But Im Upset</li>
    <li> Great brush set for the price. Neat color combo too :-)</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling or keeping in your purse for touch-ups throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Worst brushes ever. They feel like cheap paint brushes. Neither worth the wait nor money.</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft with a great price but I dont think they pick up makeup very well.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re cheap but I like them one of them broke, and sometimes the hairs come out a little bit not a lot I use it on a daily basis and its working for me not the best quality but not the worst either</li>
    <li> Very cute set. I gave it as a gift and the recipient loves them!</li>
    <li> Big blush brush already broke.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re different from the pictures, didn&#x27;t matter though they get the job done.</li>
    <li> They were very good quality for 3 dollars but overall its a great buy 💙</li>
    <li> I honestly would only recommend these to someone who does their day to day makeup with them. These brushes are okay quality but they are a little hard to use for blending. My bristles do come off sometimes but nothing major to be worried about. I just bought some other ones but these are definitely great for the price !!</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughter to play and they work really good to apply makeup</li>
    <li> At first some of the big brush&#x27;s bristles fell off but so far it&#x27;s perfect! I had sephora makeup brushes but long story short my nephew came over and was playing with all my brushes, they ended outside with my dog. And these brushes WOW!!! i think they&#x27;re better than the one&#x27;s i had!!!! (and i payed around $40 for a 8 piece at sephora)</li>
    <li> My favorite out of all</li>
    <li> It&#x27; s Good product for this money</li>
    <li> Really great brushes the only thing is that the powder brush is a little small but great for blush they don&#x27;t shed at all and very soft</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t given to her yet, but I am sure she&#x27;ll love them....they smell funny though.</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes worked great, but when I got the eyebrow comb, it was broken and I&#x27;ve had the makeup brushes for 3 months and the blush brush is cracking, but otherwise they are great brushes</li>
    <li> OMG! I just love these. Now I am going to get a bigger set but these are so perfect for those that want the basic brushes. and shipping so sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fast i was impressed. I love them. and will be ordering some more for my nieces because they love playing with make up. :D</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as it was presented! It also arrived a little earlier than the date given! Overall, great experience!</li>
    <li> Brushes are soft. Very cute. It&#x27;s neat and portable. So many brushes for cheap price. I like it :) didn&#x27;t take long in the mail either.</li>
    <li> I love the color. I tried each brush and they were okay I still wonder if these would last long if it does it would really be worth it so I am giving this a 4.</li>
    <li> Pretty good and well arranged. The brushes are a bit flimsy, but they still work really well. Definitely worth the buy though, considering the price. Absolutely wonderful!</li>
    <li> Very soft. Perfect for my needs. I will definitely be purchasing again as gift items!</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the case, one of the sticks came unglued. Easy fix but still a cheap product.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Very cute, shipping and items were as described. Soft and fluffy, girlish colors, and work as intended. What&#x27;s not to love? I would even buy these for my niece due to the price! Overall, a wonderful experience! 10/10 would recommend!&amp;#34; - Kitty</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this brush set. It&#x27;s case is lovely and the brushes are so fine and smooth on your skin. For the price I paid it was definitely worth my money. It took a little longer than expected arriving, but it was worth the wait! I love it &amp; definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Just love this. The brissels do not come off brushes.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. But it took forever to receive it</li>
    <li> I like the way the brushes organized and it is really cheap. It is a good choice for starter.</li>
    <li> For less than 4$ cannot beat the price</li>
    <li> great product!!! came in less then 2 days and is amazingly soft and work well. You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Love quantity in pkg, great quality for value</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I just got them in the mail today and they&#x27;re amazing at making my makeup the way i want it to be. (:</li>
    <li> Love pink !&lt;br /&gt;Love the set</li>
    <li> So I read some reviews and I found a lot of them I didn&#x27;t agree with at all! Someone said it took a very long time for them to get it, but I got my set in 6 days which is pretty good timing. Mine are not falling apart. The only complaint I have is the tool with the plastic clear spikes and black bristles, the top of that fell of the stick part but to me it is not a big deal because I&#x27;m just going to hot glue it back on and it will be perfect! So If you are reading this disregard all the other bad reviews. I am very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Already 1 of the brushes broke :*(</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t amazing but you I get what you pay for. I was surprised at how fast I got them though</li>
    <li> Great product, the brushes are soft and easy to clean...plus it fits perfectly in my purse.</li>
    <li> Great starter makeup brush set. I have never used brushes before for makeup application so this was my tester before I bought more expensive ones. All of them worked great and so far have stood up well since receiving them two months ago.</li>
    <li> Love my makeup brushes; their super cute and soft. Also the brush hairs do NOT fall out while wet. Its pretty amazing. My only problem is that the top half of the biggest brush fell off from the bottom half, it was no big deal though, i was easily able to tape them back together and i haven&#x27;t had a problem since then; because of what happend i gave the product 4/5 stars. Still a great buy though!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very pretty but once I touched them the hairs started to fall right out! But they were cheap so I can&#x27;t really complain! Just wish they didn&#x27;t shed like they do</li>
    <li> I love them especially the case.</li>
    <li> works like a pro and comes with literally everything you need for a 12 year old</li>
    <li> All OF MY BRUSH HEADS CAME OFF VERY POOR QUALITY!!! wish I could get my money BACK OR SOME NEW BRUSHES!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a very tidy, useful organizer</li>
    <li> i love them there just the way they say they are there so soft and well worth getting. i will buy again. fast on time good deal.</li>
    <li> They work pretty good for the price, but when i washed them they kinda became flat otherwise it blends okay</li>
    <li> just using mine today for the first time one of my brushes just fall part the one I got from the store work better then this gosh what a waste of money</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Have bought 3 sets. Love these.</li>
    <li> I received these brushes and the powder/blush brush was missing from the case then the eye applicator brush bristles fell out during the first wash. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> They were pink just as shown great for that price  I just wish they&#x27;d included a foundation brush but great product overall...UPDATE HORRIBLE BRUSHES ....SUCKED ALL MY MAKEUP UP NONE WENT ON MY FACE</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t pick up the makeup off the pallet very well.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very light and silky kind of. Not rough at all. Works great with blending my make up.</li>
    <li> i love brush sets cus i am a huge makeup freak,i ordered these brushsets and when i recieved them they were bran new and they were very nice</li>
    <li> Nice pouch . brushes are soft. Love the color.fits on my purse perfectly. Love the way it works on me</li>
    <li> The delivery was fast, and I got them on time. The quality is good. It&#x27;s not bad at all... they&#x27;re really soft brushes and they do their job right (: It is true that some of the hair falls out.... but by just &amp;#34;squeezing&amp;#34; them in the metal part with some sort of tweezers... they&#x27;ll be fine. Wash them before using them. They REALLY cute, and i believe that if you like them: AWESOME! if you don&#x27;t... just keep in my that it was only $3 dollars and something. Not a big deal :) Try them!</li>
    <li> I am actually really surprised with the quality of this set. The brushes are really soft but they work well. I like all the tools it comes with. I feel like i use them all pretty frequently. they only thing i don&#x27;t use is the case (it smells really bad like plastic) but i just keep them in my makeup organizer anyway. i will recommend these brushes and more than likely end up buying more. Since i don&#x27;t usually clean mine, I just buy new ones, it makes it easy since these are affordable but also the quality i am looking for</li>
    <li> I love this set worth the money.  Im ordering two more sets for gifts.  Cant beat  the price at all.  It came very fast.</li>
    <li> it seems like a great deal, but when I got the brushes, it came quickly, which was good, but the bristles came out immediately, and the top came off completely, but it is only under $4, not the best but they are ok, if they didn&#x27;t fall out when I got them:(</li>
    <li> The ONLY thing good about these brushes are the color &amp; the case. They are horrible quality. Even though they were cheap they were over priced.</li>
    <li> i like brushed very simply for beggingers like me. they broke but an easy fix the glue gun can do. picks up color good for eye shadows and lip. i recommend it to those who like to save an extra money on their pocket. This is the best thing but like i said good price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing, they are of great quality , they do not fall out like some have reviewed! :)</li>
    <li> I was looking for an inexpensive brush set with the essentials and this product more than exceeded my expectations. The brushes are soft and a great value.</li>
    <li> I like that this set almost everything...but the set had a strong smell...had to was more than once before i used them.</li>
    <li> Great, worked out nicely, product was good quality</li>
    <li> The perfect inexpensive set of makeup brushes to round out my needs.  Lots of choices for brush tips and all have important uses.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get to me. Case seemed cheap.</li>
    <li> Very nice gift for a teen (it&#x27;s soft, it&#x27;s cute). She loves this set!</li>
    <li> I like it, it is beautiful.</li>
    <li> I love it for.&lt;br /&gt;but for some reason the hairs in the brush was coming out.&lt;br /&gt;but other than that its nice.</li>
    <li> Kind of cheap..pretty though</li>
    <li> These brushes are fun, girly and reasonably priced. I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they seem like they are okay quality.</li>
    <li> love this I truly needed each piece was even more pleased that it came with it own cute travel case.</li>
    <li> Never received this item this piece of s*** changed his email so I couldn&#x27;t tell him about it I will be contacting Amazon to get a refund</li>
    <li> Great brushes, came fast, I&#x27;ve had them for about a month and use them everyday and they&#x27;re still in great condition! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I love it! Only like 4 dollars and it&#x27;s not cheap at all</li>
    <li> Itsacurallyvery nice for the price</li>
    <li> These brushes are great!! I&#x27;m a somewhat heavy make up user and the brushes are soft and precise.</li>
    <li> Good brushes. Arrived earlier than expected. some brushes were falling out but once i washed them they stopped. good brushes overall for the price.</li>
    <li> It was very useful and handy</li>
    <li> Really good for the price, only complain is that the brushes aren&#x27;t labeled&amp; that they are not easy to lean but overall good product for the price</li>
    <li> It got here pretty fast. But the brushes were really cheap. The bristels were falling out. And were all over the pakage.</li>
    <li> First of all I just want to say how impressed I&#x27;m on how fast it got here I place order July 28 and received it July 31 , it said it would take about a month but only took 3 days , as I open the cute little pink bag the brushes did have a plastic smell but keep in mind that the bag has a plastic sort of material on the inside so that explains a lot . This brushes are great for the price I just wouldn&#x27;t use it for heavy make up or nothing like that , the brushes a very very soft ,I mean the quality is not bad and for the price this brushes are great so far.</li>
    <li> love it worth every penny thanks</li>
    <li> I really like these and they are pretty decent quality. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Omg I love these brushes kept them and didn&#x27;t use them because they looked so pretty but I finally gave in and I&#x27;m so happy I did! They are so soft an pink! I will defiantly use these till they need to be replaced but so far so good sturdy and soft a must buy for the make up would! Xoxo</li>
    <li> ehh blush brush fell apart 2nd time I used it, but I put it back together with the hot glue gun. other than that its good.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes!! They are so soft! It smelled like paint at first, so I just let the smell go away before using. They work wonderful :)</li>
    <li> Great price, however fell apart quickly. Kinda dissatisfied with that, however Great application for makeup.</li>
    <li> I love the color and that is a full set but one of the brushes broke before I even used them and others a loose</li>
    <li> The eyeliner brush was the only brush for use to me because the others&#x27; bristles comes out. I don&#x27;t recommend to buy this.</li>
    <li> Great product and good customer service. I have always liked this brand and continue to buy it. Will do business gain...</li>
    <li> The brushes keep falling off the actual stick. Looks the same as pictured but you definitely get what you pay for. It also took longer than expected to arrive.</li>
    <li> I love them! They are so soft and cute. None of the bristles fall out either. Perfect quality and price</li>
    <li> Cheap, cheap cheap! You get what you pay for! I have one of the smaller brushes that do not have any brissles on it already. They just fell off! What was really bad is one of the eye shadow brushes brissles fell off my first time using it and scratched my eye! Hard, cheap, brushes! I am only given it two stars because I like the bag and the blush brush!</li>
    <li> I love it. It applies so easy and blends so good. Easy to wash without falling apart with my first use.</li>
    <li> Great cheap little set! You get what you pay for I have no complaints! I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend picked this out she didnt get the first one it was lost in the mail she reordred it with a make up kit and loves it .</li>
    <li> Some of the brush bristles were bent and ruined but my daughter still loved them. If they had been for me I would&#x27;ve been highly upset but she was happy</li>
    <li> The brushes de okay but they brake easily after a while .</li>
    <li> The hair of the brushes is rather loose</li>
    <li> Really liked the softness of the brushes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m changing from 5 stars to 2. The brushes ended up falling off the holders. Cheaply made. The bristles ended up&lt;br /&gt;Falling out.</li>
    <li> Took about a year to get here... Don&#x27;t like the brushes.</li>
    <li> On the smaller brushes the bristles fell out. The big fluffy brush was amazing.. All in all they they were good for what I paid for them but, I personally wouldn&#x27;t repurchase. Also the handles were a little to short for my liking.</li>
    <li> Love them they are so cute and work really well!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the material</li>
    <li> Great price, quick ship. I love these brushes. One brush fell apart but the rest were solid. Didn&#x27;t matter at that price.</li>
    <li> I like this product but not a real professional type brushes, more for a biginner</li>
    <li> not impressed at all.... i guess you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> They are good brushes I still use them. However the eyebrow tool did break and so did the biggest brush. Which is an easy fix otherwise the brushes are great!</li>
    <li> The brushes are so soft and of great quality!</li>
    <li> My brushes are amzing. Its nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t shed. Totally would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love these make up brushes. They look exactly as in the picture and the quality of the brushes exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes a lot... They are vet handy but they aren&#x27;t the best quality... The puffy brush broke the first time I opened it... I&#x27;m not mad or upset I can still use them just got to be light handed with them... But for the price their great... U get what u paid for👍</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like these, but that&#x27;s me</li>
    <li> Perfect thank you yay</li>
    <li> I really like it and I feel bad to use it since It&#x27;s so cute. It&#x27;s very strong and well done stuff. I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> very good, they are not natural animal hair but they are soft enough and work very good for amateurs, they suppurated my expectation for such a good price</li>
    <li> I love them. Just what I needed&lt;br /&gt;I use them everyday. As a matter of fact my girlfriend asked me to order hersome.</li>
    <li> I have just received this brushes and they are a few weeks early! The brushes are really cute and soft. However, when I first opened them, the packaging and the bristles reeked of an unnatural chemical-like smell. I&#x27;ll most likely dispose the case since I won&#x27;t be using it and I&#x27;ll be washing the brushes before I use them, so that won&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the brushes themself, the bristles are soft and gentle on your skin. Although, the bristles aren&#x27;t as thick as you would compare to ordinary makeup brushes. Meaning -- they won&#x27;t pack as much eye shadow or powder. You can definitely use these for quick and simple makeup looks but if you wanted to use these for intense makeup, these will NOT hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s an okay product but I won&#x27;t be buying them again.</li>
    <li> I am only giving them one star because astar rating is required. I bought these and I really wish I didnt&#x27;t. 1) they are Not durable an break VERY easily 2) when you clean them the bristles fall out 3) they are not very soft, they&#x27;re okay for the price but th eyebrow comb is so rough it left my skin red. I tried fixing the broken ones with hot glue and they still didnt hold up. save your money and buy a better quality set!</li>
    <li> I would Not buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Used for a gift, but had a bit of an odor. The odor dissipated after a few days (after leaving them out and open for a few days) but could still be detected.</li>
    <li> These brushes are AMAZING for only $4.</li>
    <li> The heads are falling off of the sticks.... it&#x27;s a nice case and the brushes are soft but they are cheaply made.  Good for the price though.  I am happy overall.</li>
    <li> The brushes were pretty good, but the bag that it was supposed to come with never arrived. I got all the brushes I ordered, and  they were of good quality.</li>
    <li> I received the brushes but I did not receive the bags.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my mom.  She loves them.</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the price.  My daughter really likes them.</li>
    <li> Shipped faster than I thought. Brushes are cute. No problems whatsoever. Great price!</li>
    <li> they were very nice and soft.</li>
    <li> The brushes are a little hard.. And they are almost the same</li>
    <li> I would not recommend it to anyone.because it can damage you skin.its not gentle at all</li>
    <li> I have bought better but this one is still very good for its price.</li>
    <li> Very nice pink case w/soft brushes normal size, case wraps around strings keep it shut tight.</li>
    <li> Keep on breaking not enegh glue</li>
    <li> So happy I got this I love it! Easy to store too</li>
    <li> I ordered these thinking they were going to be a little cheap quality for the price but they are SO soft especially the blush brush I would really recommend them</li>
    <li> Took almost 3 weeks to get here but I am truly amazed!</li>
    <li> my little girl loved them</li>
    <li> As soon as I open it , one of the brushes fell apart then a week later the others</li>
    <li> These are actually very beautiful in person and very soft and smooth! For the price you really can&#x27;t beat it, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this item to someone who isn&#x27;t looking to spend a bundle on name brand brushes or someone just looking for an extra set to keep around. These are wonderful!</li>
    <li> Great brushes . Love them.</li>
    <li> I remember when purchasing this it came smelling like pure chemicals.There was no way it was going on or near my face. Seller did give refund which was great. I had to toss this item out of fear.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for the price</li>
    <li> Love them so easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Well, you get what you paid for. The brushes are soft and i will admit it does feel good when you put it on you face, but it barely holds up the makeup when i am about to apply to my face. And they came apart the 3rd week i had them because the bondage of the glue came apart. I can&#x27;t get mad because I did get a good use out of some of the brushes, but most are not great. Love the case which was nice and girly looking.</li>
    <li> The makeup brushes were good. Although it took like a month to get here... I did like the packet it came in and the brushes were great for such a low price. I&#x27;d definitely order some more. Just because it took so long it lost a star but thats about it.</li>
    <li> Item was damaged however they replaced it! So happy with the brushes</li>
    <li> I love this brush set! It came weeks early, which I loved! The brushes are so soft and feel nice on my skin. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as good since it was so cheap, but it was amazing! I recommend this with no doubt.</li>
    <li> I was actually looking forward to these, but instead I received 3 iphone 4 chargers? Wasn&#x27;t happy about that.</li>
    <li> The brushes are pretty . But you get what you pay for !</li>
    <li> totally recomened it because they don&#x27;t don&#x27;t shade and they blend make up really nicely</li>
    <li> Brushes are pretty in color, love the case it comes in. However, the larger brushes are flimsy and don&#x27;t hold my make up long enough to put on my face. The smaller brushes are pretty decent. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone though.</li>
    <li> The hairs on the brush was falling off in clumps. These brushes were not put together very well. The brush and the \\&quot;wand\\&quot; came apart due to it being glued poorly</li>
    <li> Great price! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great price point good quality</li>
    <li> they were exactly wat i expected wish they came earlier but loved them</li>
    <li> Good for price. And it&#x27;s pretty</li>
    <li> Love the brushes. So cute. Great condition and work nice. Don&#x27;t look or feel cheap. Plus they came much sooner than expected delivery date.  I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Love this make-up brush set.</li>
    <li> Good brushes and case</li>
    <li> Took forever to arrive but it was worth the wait</li>
    <li> Purchased for my 13-year-old. Even as a less expensive option, I was disappointed in the quality. Thank goodness I inspected each brush before gifting as one of the brushes fell off the handle when I pulled it out of the case.  I just glued it back on.</li>
    <li> Really pleased with the quality of these brushes. I purchased another set at the beauty supply store for a lot more money and I like these much better.</li>
    <li> The smell is not good. The brushes can hardly pickup the makeup because they&#x27;re too soft. Overall, they&#x27;re good.</li>
    <li> Great purchase. For the price of $3, I couldn&#x27;t say no to this deal. I decided to give it a try and they work well. They are very soft yet very firm. It&#x27;s easy to work with.</li>
    <li> just got mine today and bristles are all in tact brushes are beautiful and work very well thank you.....also love the carry case</li>
    <li> i was so excited to get this brushes, the price was okay but the quality is really bad i would not recommend</li>
    <li> Arrived much faster than anticipated. Brush quality is good, as well as the durability of the carrying case.</li>
    <li> They had a plastic smell and aren&#x27;t good for blending eyeshadow.They also don&#x27;t wash well.Wont buy again.</li>
    <li> These brushes arrived very quickly, as always when ordering with Amazon. They are just as described and are made with good quality. Of course they are not the best out there, but they are spot on for the price. I only wish the big one has slightly firmer bristles for better application.</li>
    <li> I would never ever purchase these brushes again. They go broken easily, they shed and they are not strong enough.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather invest on better quality brushes such as sigma brushes or MAC brushes. Disappointed, for real.</li>
    <li> Cute for traveling and maybe gift give aways</li>
    <li> used some of the brushes.  Some bristles fell ouT but didn&#x27;t fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;The eye brushes are good</li>
    <li> It does what it was bought to do. The brushes makes it easier to apply my make up and i love the little case.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!  The pink bag they come in is so nice and the brushes feel high quality... makeup applies smoothly with them.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong ! I really like these brushes! Now I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it has a wired smell and it took a while to get here (because they come from Hong Kong ) and the price is great for ok quality brushes</li>
    <li> I like my brushes but i do not love them. They are super soft and they old on to the shadow very well and can apply the shadow on nicely. the only thing i don&#x27;t like is that they do shed. I honestly do not care about the shedding because it is not a lot, but i wish they were put together better. If it didn&#x27;t have that problem i would love them.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, and with that in mind the brushes are very soft.  One of the brushes is damaged with glue in the bristle, but I&#x27;m hoping I can get it out with a good wash. Not a set I would use on my clients, but fine to use on myself .</li>
    <li> Shipping was slow, but it did arrive in the time frame they gave. The brushes are nice, not the best out there but you can&#x27;t beat them for the price! I have better brushes, but they have cost me over $35 each. I really like these ones to carry with me or to take on vacation so I don&#x27;t have to take the chance of losing my others. I would purchase this item again!</li>
    <li> I only use three of the brushes. At first some of the bristles were falling out but that seems to have stopped. Not a bad deal for the price.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT. IT CAME IN QUICKLY. THE BRUSHES ARE VERY SOFT AND ARE GREAT TO DO MY MAKE UP. NOT EXPENSIVE AT ALL. THIS IS WORTH EVERY DIME.</li>
    <li> If I know I would have to wait for a month, I definitely would not buy it!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great and a very useful travel pack. They are so soft and help me apply my makeup smoothly.</li>
    <li> just need case so gave away brushes .good brushes just did not need fast service nice case. pink is ok wish for better color choice</li>
