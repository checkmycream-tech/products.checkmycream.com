      <li>I received the Fekkai Technician Color Care Shampoo and Conditioner to try as a BzzAgent, and I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>My favorite shampoo and conditioner!</li>
      <li>I tried using this stuff and it is amazing, and works much better than kerastase!</li>
      <li>really love these products and may replace my beloved Nexxus, which I have used for over a decade, with the Fekkai items.</li>
      <li>conditoner has a wonderful smell, natural not \\&quot;chemically.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair as well, and I had body without too many tangles when using this system.  </li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t purchased more because I am reluctant to buy at the $18 dollar per bottle cost.  </li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>I used the Fekkai color-care products longer, my hair became more manageable and shinier.</li>
      <li>Love the matching shampoo as well.</li>
      <li>I will now only use fekkai as it is good stuff!!</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>Worth the price!!</li>
      <li>I was able to comb thru my hair easily w/out any tangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair also started to tangle more easily.</li>
      <li>It is definitely better than most drugstore brands, but is it worth the premium price?</li>
      <li>It does a fine job of conditioning my color treated hair.</li>
      <li>have fine &amp; color treated hair, I only needed to use a dab of this in my hair &amp; I let it sit for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;The rinse was easy &amp; my hair felt even more protected, and I loved the smell.  </li>
      <li>I am a Bzz agent, I was fortunate to receive free bottles of the Fekkai Technician Color Care shampoo and conditioner for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner have a citrus scent and feel light when applied.  </li>
      <li>In the class of high end  conditioners, this does pretty good.</li>
      <li>or if I have a special occasion coming up</li>
      <li>I splurged on this conditioner and got compliments right away!</li>
      <li>I would never pay full price.    </li>
      <li>For me this used to be an easy 5 star product; I&#x27;d had great results with this pair for years but over the past year</li>
      <li>I read the reviews with some healthy skepticism, as I&#x27;ve tried many hair products making similar claims - but this one is worth the hype.  </li>
      <li>Really helps with frizzy, fine hair.</li>
      <li>where I really want my hair to be fabulous.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic, leaves my hair silky soft, shiny, and smooth.  </li>
      <li>hair feels fantastic, soft &amp; full.  </li>
      <li>super fast delivery.</li>
      <li>But, shipping from the seller was slow and the packaging and items were not in great condition on arrival.</li>
      <li>My hair becomes super smooth and still light and fluffy after using this conditioner.</li>
      <li>It leaves it soft and a bit shiny, but nothing extraordinary.     </li>
      <li>think the main reason most of use color care shampoo and conditioner is to keep our color looking vibrant as long as possible in between salon appointments and Fekkai Technician Color Care Conditioner did that for me by giving my hair a healthy shine and protecting against UV ray damage.</li>
      <li>I use to use kerastase shampoo and conditioner, and didn&#x27;t feel like it did THAT much...</li>
      <li>but you can find it for fairly reasonable on line if you just look.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Conditioner: I really like the consistency of the Fekkai conditioner.</li>
      <li>so I really have to watch the products I use on it.</li>
      <li>I wanted to wait to review the Frederic Fekkai Technician Color Care Conditioner and shampoo, until I could really gauge the results.</li>
      <li>This product has actually improved the condition of my hair significantly in the couple months I have been using it.  </li>
      <li>I do not need much, and I do not have to leave it in very long for it to detangle and smooth my hair.</li>
      <li>This conditioner helps my hair feel healthy without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>My hair is color treated and damaged from heat styling and just from getting older.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this..both shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>OK but seems to leave my hair a little oilier than it used to.</li>
      <li>The new squared off bottles are a completely new formulation that will leave your hair frizzy!</li>
      <li>My hair became dry and coarse as I (gulp) got older, and I needed to do something to make it look better.</li>
      <li>It is expensive but very nice.</li>
      <li>I color my hair red, which is a hard color to keep, and I think the Fekkai products do a good job of preserving the color.  </li>
      <li>I love how gentle it is on my scalp and how silky my thick hair feels.</li>
      <li>I found this bottle of the old formulation!  </li>
      <li>as good a job for less than half the price.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my color-treated hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
      <li>The result of using both products, even after one use, was shiny, soft bouncy</li>
      <li>Giving benefit of the doubt, I decided to assume it was that my old product was, well.... old.</li>
      <li>I definitely think you need to buy both the Frederic Fekkai Technician Color Care Shampoo and Color Care Conditioner and use them together because they really work in tandem.</li>
      <li>I tried it a few more times, but my hair only seemed to get progressively drier.</li>
      <li>i mean immediately my hair was better...</li>
      <li>I actually got a compliment from my daughter and her fiancee, tehy said my hair looks and feels so soft and shiny!</li>
      <li>I compared what was left in my old bottle and the new and there was definitely *</li>
      <li>I have to leave other conditioners on my hair for an hour, but the Fekkai conditioner does its magic in a few minutes.</li>
      <li>but I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t getting the same fabulous results that I&#x27;d had in the past.</li>
      <li>I barely tie it up</li>
      <li>Although I really like the products I have other color care products that do</li>
      <li>no brassiness that occurs when dark brown dye fades too much</li>
      <li>I also noticed that my hair was very manageable, not weighed down or flyaway.  </li>
      <li>It is not too thin and spreads easily through my hair.</li>
      <li>I regularly is it, because I find it is mild, gentle on my hair color, and very lightly scented (I hate heavily scented products).</li>

    <li> I received the Fekkai Technician Color Care Shampoo and Conditioner to try as a BzzAgent, and I am very pleased with the results.  I color my hair red, which is a hard color to keep, and I think the Fekkai products do a good job of preserving the color.  I also noticed that my hair was very manageable, not weighed down or flyaway.  The shampoo and conditioner have a citrus scent and feel light when applied.  I have very fine hair as well, and I had body without too many tangles when using this system.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5 star rating is the price.  My bottles are almost empty but I haven&#x27;t purchased more because I am reluctant to buy at the $18 dollar per bottle cost.  Although I really like the products I have other color care products that do ~almost~ as good a job for less than half the price.  I can see me purchasing these in the future if I begin having problems with my hair or if I have a special occasion coming up where I really want my hair to be fabulous.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> This coditioner is amazing! It leaves my color-treated hair feeling soft and silky. This conditioner helps my hair feel healthy without weighing it down. Worth the price!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I use to use kerastase shampoo and conditioner, and didn&#x27;t feel like it did THAT much... I tried using this stuff and it is amazing, and works much better than kerastase! I will now only use fekkai as it is good stuff!! My hair feels amazing!</li>
    <li> My hair became dry and coarse as I (gulp) got older, and I needed to do something to make it look better. I splurged on this conditioner and got compliments right away! It is expensive but very nice. I learned, after using it for a few weeks, that if I use it twice a week and intersperse it with a less fancy conditioner, that works well too. This is a nice indulgence!</li>
    <li> Fekkai Technician Color Care shampoo and conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I am a Bzz agent, I was fortunate to receive free bottles of the Fekkai Technician Color Care shampoo and conditioner for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy to curly, color-treated hair that is thick and somewhat coarse. Both the Fekkai shampoo and conditioner have a wonderful scent that is neither overwhelming nor artificial-smelling.The result of using both products, even after one use, was shiny, soft bouncy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I used the Fekkai color-care products longer, my hair became more manageable and shinier.I think the color protection is excellent as well. I have colored only my roots for the past 2 months, and the color on my hair length has stayed dark and rich- no brassiness that occurs when dark brown dye fades too much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love these products and may replace my beloved Nexxus, which I have used for over a decade, with the Fekkai items. I would like to try the Shea Butter line next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo: Cleans well, but I noticed it left the ends of my hair little rough and tangled after rinsing. The conditioner took care of that, however.I did not see any color washing out in the suds or rinse water, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner: I really like the consistency of the Fekkai conditioner. It is not too thin and spreads easily through my hair. I do not need much, and I do not have to leave it in very long for it to detangle and smooth my hair. I have to leave other conditioners on my hair for an hour, but the Fekkai conditioner does its magic in a few minutes. I leave it on for about 20, but I doubt that is necessary.</li>
    <li> My hair use to feel damaged, dry, and awful between hair coloring since I have been using Fekkai it is awesome! My hair feels great I barely tie it up I get so many compliments on how great it is.</li>
    <li> OK but seems to leave my hair a little oilier than it used to.</li>
    <li> I have used this conditioner on and off for about four years now. It does a fine job of conditioning my color treated hair. It leaves it soft and a bit shiny, but nothing extraordinary.     In the class of high end  conditioners, this does pretty good. It is definitely better than most drugstore brands, but is it worth the premium price? Not sold on that yet. There are less expensive products that do just as well.  I buy it occasionally when it goes on sale. I would never pay full price.    The fragrance is also a bit medicinal, but it does not linger on your hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  Yes it IS expensive but you can find it for fairly reasonable on line if you just look.  It smells fantastic, leaves my hair silky soft, shiny, and smooth.  I had to do some searching but found it for half of what I pay at the local store.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews with some healthy skepticism, as I&#x27;ve tried many hair products making similar claims - but this one is worth the hype.  My hair is color treated and damaged from heat styling and just from getting older.  This product has actually improved the condition of my hair significantly in the couple months I have been using it.  A little bit goes a long way, so while it&#x27;s more expensive, it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> My hair becomes super smooth and still light and fluffy after using this conditioner. Also it smells great and feels wonderful when you use it.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY! I have long, thick, frizzy, and slightly wavy hair. I read the great reviews on here, so I decided to try it. Massive disappointment. My hair looked dull and felt really dry after only one use. I tried it a few more times, but my hair only seemed to get progressively drier. My hair also started to tangle more easily. For this amount of money, I was expecting a miracle. Instead, I got results that were on par with the cheapest/crappiest stuff at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately that includes this shampoo and conditioner. For me this used to be an easy 5 star product; I&#x27;d had great results with this pair for years but over the past year or so I think they may have changed the formula. Still smells great but I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t getting the same fabulous results that I&#x27;d had in the past. I compared what was left in my old bottle and the new and there was definitely *something* different. Giving benefit of the doubt, I decided to assume it was that my old product was, well.... old. Tried giving my hair a break from the brand, tried buying from a different source, still not the same.  Too expensive to keep trying so I&#x27;ve had to move on to a different product.</li>
    <li> Love the product. I regularly is it, because I find it is mild, gentle on my hair color, and very lightly scented (I hate heavily scented products). But, shipping from the seller was slow and the packaging and items were not in great condition on arrival.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this..both shampoo and conditioner. my hair is damaged..terrible from working outside..used these..and immediately...i mean immediately my hair was better...best price around...target was 22 each!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to go along with the Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine &amp; color treated hair, I only needed to use a dab of this in my hair &amp; I let it sit for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;The rinse was easy &amp; my hair felt even more protected, and I loved the smell.  I was able to comb thru my hair easily w/out any tangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels fantastic, soft &amp; full.  I look forward to using this each time I wash my hair ~ Other brand shampoo/conditioners have left my hair feeling \\&quot;meh\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!</li>
    <li> I found this bottle of the old formulation!  The new squared off bottles are a completely new formulation that will leave your hair frizzy! I&#x27;m so disappointed that Fekkai reformulated.  It took a long time to find something that worked well for me.  I guess the hunt is on again.</li>
    <li> Leaves the hair in great condition</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that&#x27;s naturally dry so I really have to watch the products I use on it. I wanted to wait to review the Frederic Fekkai Technician Color Care Conditioner and shampoo, until I could really gauge the results. I have to say after using both for awhile, that these are great products!&lt;br /&gt;The conditoner has a wonderful smell, natural not \\&quot;chemically.\\&quot; It&#x27;s thick and luxuriant, it moisturizes and tames dry hair but doesn&#x27;t leave it flat or lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;I think the main reason most of use color care shampoo and conditioner is to keep our color looking vibrant as long as possible in between salon appointments and Fekkai Technician Color Care Conditioner did that for me by giving my hair a healthy shine and protecting against UV ray damage. I definitely think you need to buy both the Frederic Fekkai Technician Color Care Shampoo and Color Care Conditioner and use them together because they really work in tandem. I had smooth, manageable hair, without any color fading and my hair smelled great!</li>
    <li> I tried this product as a sample and then had to have it.  I love how gentle it is on my scalp and how silky my thick hair feels.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner for color treated hair. Can use every day. Really helps with frizzy, fine hair. Love the matching shampoo as well.</li>
    <li> super fast delivery. wonderful product for your hair softens it up after a hi lite  my favorite conditioner</li>
    <li> Great conditioner for colored hair!! I actually got a compliment from my daughter and her fiancee, tehy said my hair looks and feels so soft and shiny!</li>
