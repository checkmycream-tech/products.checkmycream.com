<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Came very quickly. I have used this product for years. It has a pleasant fragrance, not overly strong but it is  EDT and not a cologne so one wouldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;expect it to be really strong smelling. Was brand new in original packaging and a great price. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> My husband loved it and it smells fresh and clean. It last a good while and doesn&#x27;t fade out too soon.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent and for the price you get what you pay for. You have to spray a lot on and the smell fades...oh and FYI I&#x27;m not a guy that takes cologne bathes. I also wear Aqua Di Gio and Echo and I only use 2 to 3 sprays of those when I use them, I have to use 5-6 sprays of this stuff and my GF says it still fades away.</li>
    <li> I have the female version of Hei. This fragrance just doesn&#x27;t have the fineness that I expected and read in the reviews. Hei, on me, smelled cheap and heavy. It also has lingering power because even after I showered, trying to rid the scent, I could still smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we have to keep in mind are the chemical effects. Tresor lasts and lasts on my skin, so does White Linen, but Romance by Lauren does not. Shi has staying power on me, and so (unfortunately) does Hei, but I don&#x27;t like the what it reacted with my chemistry. I smelled cheap, which is pointless in the beauty of fragrance.</li>
    <li> Came very well packaged and a good price!</li>
    <li> Not too strong, not too weak...a perfect balance...To get desired effect, you have to spray 3-4 times though instead of just twice.</li>
    <li> Gift for my husband.  Love this scent! Couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. One of my coworkers recomended it yo me and I loved it :D</li>
    <li> My son likes it, smells good fresh and young</li>
    <li> great price fast delivery very happy!</li>
    <li> Love this scent for men. Its light and smells soooo good. Kind of like an old school Cool Water. I bought this for my fiance and I love it when we are out and other women compliment him on the way he smells. My fiance was a little apprehensive at first because he had never heard of this and once he opened it and smelled it he instantly fell in love with it. He is really picky about his cologne too. I highly suggest this as a gift for the man in your life. Its very classy and masculine at the same time. You cant go wrong!</li>
    <li> clean, fresh new sent, you can&#x27;t go wrong in my opinion.  I think its original...not well know...not over-powering scent, light/subtle.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  Subtle, not too strong.</li>
    <li> perfect scent year round</li>
    <li> One of the best fragrances for men out there. I always get asked what cologne in wearing :-)</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great without being overbearing or too much. As a person who suffers from migraines I can say that this is not a cologne that triggers them! YEEHAW! I love this cologne as well as Paradise both from Alfred Sung. If you want to try a cologne or want to buy one for someone as a gift I think this is a great choice that most anyone would enjoy.</li>
    <li> Love this Cologne and its about time to buy some more. Best compliment i got from wearing this, from a gal at my work..\\&quot;does your girlfriend know you are going out in public smelling that good?\\&quot; I think that speaks for itself. Will be buying this again</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE PRODUCT BUT I THINK IT IS A LITTLE WEAK ON SMELL. I USE THIS ALL THE TIME AND THE SCENT IS VERY WEEK. DOES NOT HAVE THE STRONG SCENT AS MY OLD STUFF. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SETTING ON A SHELF A LONG TIME OR GOT TO HOT OR COLD IN STORAGE. THANKS DOUG</li>
    <li> I could not find this anywhere in the stores, and of course Amazon came through again and had a great price.  The shipment came very fast, just in time for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Not as long-lasting as I had hoped but the price was right. I would consider buying it again. Great product for this price point!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and  finally found it  ordered 2</li>
    <li> It is one of the best cologne that you can buy that does not have an overpowering scent and yet still attracts compliments. Purchasing this from Amazon guaranteed timely delivery and the best price which was equal in comparison to the male and female scents offered by Alfred Sung over the years and those who know of these products would equally recommend to other buyers that this is a great product.</li>
    <li> &#x27;Been burned countless times on Ebay, I will now only deal with Amazon. Because their sellers are trustworthy, they never fail to deliver and I never ever felt that sinking feeling that I will be receiving a fake product. This cologne is just one of the many quick delivery, easy transaction and authentic item I&#x27;ve bought from one of the many Amazon sellers. Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> My favorite scent! I&#x27;m surprised by its relative obscurity.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my hubby for our anniversary. He has been dying to have this again. Once he used it all up we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. We ended up finding it in a place they opened up in the mall but they wanted 3 times what I paid for it on here. Now my hubby is very happy to have his favorite scent back and I&#x27;m a very happy wife with extra money in my pocket for other items :)</li>
    <li> This scent is great, and I continue to receive compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light without fading out or getting lost after an hour, and spicy without feeling like a six-year-old&#x27;s scent experiment. I notice that I spray on more than I normally would with other scents, but it doesn&#x27;t seem overpowering (at least I haven&#x27;t been told).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to Hei at a shop that wanted to charge _way_ too much for some fragrance in a bottle, so Amazon is great.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to my husband, for everyday use that did not smell  like &amp;#34;wood or alcohol&amp;#34; and this was the perfect cologne for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband also love this one because is a soft fragance.  It&#x27;s sweet but not too much to be like a woman fragance.</li>
    <li> This cologne is the best. I bought it for my husband and he fell in love with it! I must admit that I have no complaints, especially when he walks past and I find myself smiling as the scent captures my nose. I do plan on ordering more!</li>
    <li> Great price, great product and its one of my favorite scents of all times. I love it and wear it often</li>
    <li> This was delivered super fast (In 2 days!) and I based my purchase totally on amazon.com ratings. No regrets. Hubby is impressed and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a manly fragrance. Not flowery, may be a hint of citrus.....like another reviewer stated, &#x27;Right out of the shower&#x27; kind of fragrance. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage son and he fell in love with the smell.He wears it all the time.Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite colognes, glad i found it in stock and at the price i did. Thanks</li>
    <li> The price makes this por homme fragrance worthwhile.  Great daytime fragrance.  My only real complaint is that the dieback is very quick</li>
    <li> I love this. My boyfriend is in  banking and has to be conservative, professional, and classy. This fits the bill.</li>
    <li> WOW. Smells great and clean....wish it would last a little longer than 4 to 5 hours . Overall very happy and price it a big plus.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite cologne at such a good price.  Glad I found it at Amazon</li>
    <li> Great product!! Alfred Sung discovered the perfect medium between sweet and musky, light and heavy, and subtle and pronounced. I wear it almost everyday and I have gotten SEVERAL compliments about the cologne. As a self-proclaimed men&#x27;s cologne connoisseur, I believe this is one of the best colognes available. I recommend it for anybody and everybody who appreciates sophisticated scents that are very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Cologne wasn&#x27;t real, real bottle is blue this one was clear,smelled like toilet water,  shocked this happened because I always buy this very cologne from  Amazon.com.  I will never buy from Amazon.com again.</li>
    <li> Great smelling fragrance that I&#x27;m about to order again.  Ladies love this cologne.  A must have for the collection.  Not to mention that it&#x27;s very affordable!!!!!</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite and was nearly out. Shipped out fast!</li>
    <li> Always nice and affordable</li>
    <li> i bought this for my grandson jake for chanukah and he opened it right away and sprayed some on himself.  the scent was very nice and not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting. This is a somewhat dated fragrance, but it is very nice and can be worn anywhere at anytime. You won&#x27;t get a better quality cologne for this price. It has great projection and performs above average.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite cologne. I stumbled upon it while buying a few suits at the Men&#x27;s Warehouse and have been hooked ever since.</li>
    <li> A great product. It is my all-time favorite. I have always had people ask me what I was wearing everytime, everyday. It is my wife&#x27;s favorite!! So, eh!! wife-approved too.</li>
    <li> Price is right ($17 free shipping) and the scent is very nice but it has a short life span.&lt;br /&gt;I would say you get approximately 3 to 4 hours before the scent dies off.</li>
    <li> this product was just as advertised. it&#x27;s what i wanted and it came as promised. what more can you ask.</li>
    <li> Love this! Smells great! Hard to find in stores and this is a great price! I was told at Macy&#x27;s that it has been discontinued...but I hope they are wrong!</li>
    <li> My hunny loved this. It has a very masculine earthy scent without being overpowering and musky.</li>
    <li> Everytime I hang out with one of my friends, Sam, I always have to give him the biggest hug right when I see him and again before he leaves because I love this smell so much! I am a slut for this cologne! This has been going on for some time now so I finally decided to buy it for my boyfriend and I still can never get enough :)</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and was exactly what I wanted.  It smells great and a better price than a department store.</li>
    <li> Great deal on a cologne that is hard to find. It is the only thing I wear. Give it a try</li>
    <li> IT HAS A WONDERFUL AROMA -AND everytime I put some on ,woman come up to me and say I smell nice ...highly recommend</li>
    <li> this fragrance got rave and I mean rave reviews here on Amazon, and on fragrantica.com (the fragrance encyclopedia). I think it&#x27;s a good, all-purpose, very inoffensive scent.  Kinda boring too, truth be told, but I am a fragrance buff and maybe a bit too snooty about all this . . . . bought for my husband, he could take or leave it, so I took it from him and layer it with white musk for a unisex appeal.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for cologne that makes you smell like skunk sweat sprinkled over burning hair, look elsewhere because Alfred Sung Hei is a delight. Hei?...more like &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; because I become intoxicated everytime my husband walks by. #cheaperthanmarriagecounseling</li>
    <li> My husband loves the scent!</li>
    <li> I loved this so much! It&#x27;s smells great and my girls think that too!! I can&#x27;t even go outside anymore cause every time I do I gotta beat the ladies of with a stick. Crowds be tryna get me :P</li>
    <li> Best smelling fragrance I ever purchased. Smells like you just stepped out of the shower my wife loves it. Tim</li>
    <li> this is my husband&#x27;s standard cologne, woodsy but not overpowering, have ordered from this site the past few times and have never had any problems and a great price as well!</li>
    <li> I have had several Sung fragrances over the years. Some I have loved, some hated and others been meh about. I like this scent better than the other Sung ones I have had but this scent doesn&#x27;t hold up during the day. I wouldn&#x27;t even know I had put it on by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Love this Men&#x27;s cologne it&#x27;s my favorite</li>
    <li> My husband wanted a variety of colognes for Christmas. I got him a bottle of &amp;#34;Hei&amp;#34; and he really likes it!!!</li>
    <li> great cologne. this smells fantastic. I buy this cologne all the time for my boyfriend. he smells great. worth the money.</li>
    <li> My second favorite cologne, cheapest price ever. Will def. restock soon.</li>
    <li> Good price, but the fragrance does not last long at all.</li>
    <li> One of my all time fragrances that I had essentially forgotten about over the years. Smells just like I remember and the price is rediculously cheap! Oh and for me at least, it lasts an entire day!</li>
    <li> Love love love this cologne. My husband has worn for years and he&#x27;s always told how good he smells.</li>
    <li> Smells great, shipped fast. Get lots of compliments on smelling like a champion.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure every girl i know is pleased that I don&#x27;t smell like old dirty gym socks anymore.</li>
    <li> Great price! One of my husband&#x27;s favorites. We generally pay quite a bit more for a smaller size bottle. Love Amazon deals!</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne of all time.</li>
    <li> I remember paying $60 for this cologne many years ago when I first wore it. Hei by Alfred Sung is a scent that is timeless. It is subtle and does not get old. It still smells so good and for a little over $20 it is a steal.  I buy this cologne as a secondary.  I love alternating between Bleu de Chanel and Hei.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with the scent of Hei...I&#x27;ve never had any woman tell me that she does not like this scent. Think about that! There is always someone who doesn&#x27;t like a certain cologne that you are wearing or have worn.  Not this one.</li>
    <li> For the price it is acceptable...I did not know anything about it before ordering...I find it to be much to light a scent..it disappears quickly.  Maybe a nighttime thing but don&#x27;t think i will order it again.</li>
    <li> Smells great &amp; the price was right.</li>
    <li> Great price for cologne</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best deal on GREAT smelling cologne on the internet! I was expecting a small bottle to show up on my door step and I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the bottle. I used to pay $90 a bottle for this in the mall of my hometown, so I will be ordering 4 bottles of this next week!</li>
    <li> I never get tired of the clean smell. It lasts and lasts.Hei is my \\&quot;goto\\&quot; scent!!</li>
    <li> excellent.....!!! thanks for all</li>
    <li> This cologne is great!!!! Nice subtle scent not too overpowering.... Great for everyday use.... The best and most important part is my woman loves it.... My wallet loves it too</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite (and inexpensive) fragrances! They also have &#x27;Shi&#x27; which is the women&#x27;s complimentary fragrance to this...which I love also...and its also inexpensive!</li>
    <li> love this for my husband! very fresh clean manly smell! I don&#x27;t like very musky smells. this one has just the right amt.</li>
    <li> I used to wear Hollister and this stuff. When I had Hei on, Ive had to literally almost beat women off of me. Never met anybody that didnt like it</li>
    <li> I use this cologne for everyday use because not very much people knows about it and also because you will not get bored of wearing the same cologne everyday the scent is nice and sutil.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t been able to find this cologne to replace my old bottle. Product is now manufactured or at least labeled slightly different but same scent. You can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> I get nothing but compliments on it, and when you buy it here, it is very reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy it at Macy&#x27;s or Nordstrom but it is 1/3 the price here on Amazon...</li>
    <li> You can not bet this price!!! I usually buy this in the store and spend $50 on the set and my fiance never uses the face wash. I love that i could just buy it alone..</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR THE PRICE...&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING WAS GOOD, IT CAME SEALED.&lt;br /&gt;ITS A NICE LIGHT SCENT&lt;br /&gt;REGULAR WORK COLOGNE....&lt;br /&gt;NO REGRETS BUYING..... YOU SHOULD AS WELL...</li>
    <li> I Love it, lots of complements------------</li>
    <li> Very nice, clean, woodsy men&#x27;s Eau de Toilette. Last a long time and very worth the price! LOVE the smell on my hubby!</li>
    <li> I know my guy was talking about getting this for hims self! I wanted to do something nice for him so I got it!!! He loves it!!!  Great buy and smells fabulous!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne based on the number of good reviews it received, and it&#x27;s reasonable price, and I was not disappointed.  Some fragrances are just too strong, but this one has a nice scent which doesn&#x27;t overwhelm your senses.  I would look purchase this again or consider buying another fragrance by Alfred Sung.</li>
    <li> This is no longer available in stores.  My SO loves the scent so I am happy to have found a source.</li>
    <li> this is a fake perfume</li>
    <li> I buy this for my significant other.  He&#x27;s been wearing it for years now.  It awesome to be able to order this for 1/3 of what we used to pay in the department store.  Fresh fragrance that last all day.  I order it  at least 3 times per year</li>
    <li> This has a weak fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> great fragrance, would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend about two years ago for the first time and now this is all he loves to you. Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> this perfume smells excellent and is very long lasting great product</li>
    <li> GREAT BARGIN  LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> He is 19 and we started getting him some stuff to turn him into a man. He thought Axe was sufficient cologne....so he had that going for him.&lt;br /&gt;He liked the scent (as did his girlfriend) so much that he ran out of the graduation bottle in 6 months and we had to replenish for Christmas. I hope he isn&#x27;t using it like they do in the Axe commercials- that could explain why he&#x27;s going through it so fast....I didn&#x27;t think of that till just now.</li>
    <li> Just excellent cologne!!</li>
    <li> Good &amp; clean smelling scent!!</li>
    <li> Women love it,the price way reasonable, an this product smells really really great. It is worth every penny buy it u wont be sorry</li>
    <li> Local vendor by my office recommended this perfume to me.  Not only is it economical but the fragrance is very good.  Its a light musky smell.</li>
    <li> Brought this new scent for hubby for Christmas. Nervous because he is a Blackberry Touch kind of guy. He opened it and said he loved the scent. I personally love how it smells on him; not overbearing at all.</li>
    <li> I get compliments ALL the time from men &amp; women for this cologne. I describe it as a fresh shower scent that is extremely light on the nose. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong people WILL notice it and most will ask you what it is, at least they have in my case but it&#x27;s not something that most people will find intrusive. His other cologne &amp;#34;Paradise&amp;#34; is also a very light scent but with a hint of pine forest, once again very subtle.</li>
    <li> Smells great and it&#x27;s not to overpowering. super fast delivery in like a day or two. I always get high compliments on it. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a more of a night fragrance. I love it.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, super yummy smell!</li>
    <li> Love the bottle and the spray has a nice smell goes on floral and lingers with a light musky fragrance ...very pleasing I have purchased other Sung fragrances for my boyfriend and we have never been disappointed with any of them ..I would recommend this for a casual light fragrance</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m CONFIDENT that you will get more compliments on this scent than almost any other you&#x27;ve worn. I&#x27;VE HAD GUYS STOP ME and ask me, \\&quot;Hey man, I don&#x27;t want this to sound weird, but what cologne are you wearing?!\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve had women ON ME asking me what it is, telling me how unique it is and how great it smells.  THAT&#x27;S ALL I&#x27;M GOING TO SAY. Try it, if you don&#x27;t like it, it was only 20 bucks don&#x27;t whine!!! In fact, don&#x27;t whine at all, just respond to me via this review and I will buy the bottle from you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promise you, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> smells really good, has a really light clean scent</li>
    <li> I have worn this cologne for over a year, and this product is not only fake, but i want my money back. You couldn&#x27;t smell it after about 30min and I was soooooo pissed! UNREAL!!!</li>
    <li> My aunt bought me this for my bday one year and I loved it. Ran out of it so I looked on here to see if they had it...They did! My GF loves the scent she was glad that I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> The smell is awsome and long lasting. I would defiantly recommend to anyone. My bf loves it and so do I.</li>
    <li> I just had to have this for my husband after smelling it on a co worker. I am so glad I purchased this cologne. my husband wears it and loves it.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent. I have asthma so some scents would make it hard for me to breathe. I haven&#x27;t had that feeling with this. It lasts all day which is a huge a plus. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Many years ago, I smelled this cologne in a magazine insert and had wanted it. But I didn&#x27;t find it in my local stores and completely forgot the name of it eventually. Cleaning up my desk earlier this year I found the little insert I had torn out and ordered myself a bottle. It&#x27;s got a very nice fresh scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering and has good presence. It&#x27;s not super masculine but it is distinctly a mens cologne...although I wouldn&#x27;t object to a woman wearing it either. It&#x27;s just a nice fragrance all around.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, in time for Christmas. This stuff is so expensive elsewhere. Glad to see it on Amazon for a better price. My husband was trilled over the larger bottle. He uses it often and I guess I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> I love Alfred Sung&#x27;s line. All of the perfumes or cologne&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried smell amazing. this was my husband&#x27;s first time using this line and he loved it.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome smelling cologne for men!  I&#x27;m have a ton of cologne and this is one of my favorites.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed and the ladies won&#x27;t either! ;)</li>
    <li> not too overpowering.  i don&#x27;t like having to type more than i want to, so please remove that requirement very soon as its irritating.</li>
    <li> Highly underrated,  this is a great light scent that lasts.  Price makes almost seem free</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. clean, simple, masculine.</li>
    <li> I CHOOSE THIS RATING BECAUSE OF PRIOR USE. I COULD&#x27;NT WAIT TO PURCHASE IT AGAIN. IF YOU WANT A CLEAN NOT TO OVER BARING COLOGNE THIS IS THE ONE.</li>
    <li> Great price. The smell reminds me of the clean smell you get after stepping out of the shower.  Long lasting.</li>
    <li> My cousin told me about Hei by Alfred Sung 5 years ago and I have been using it ever since. What I like most about it is that it isn&#x27;t a very common cologne, so the ladies will find it pleasant that you smell good, but don&#x27;t smell like one of those name brand fragrances at the mall ;) The aroma of this cologne is perfect for everyday use, it&#x27;s not too overpowering, but still fresh and distinct at the same time. Give it a shot! For less than $20 dollars shipped to your door, why not?</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling cologne ever! The price just makes it that much better, BUY IT NOW!</li>
    <li> I live this cologne and so does my girl! Makes my nights Rock!</li>
    <li> the only cologne i have worn for the past ten years. i always, always get compliments. it&#x27;s perfectly balanced, transcends trends and is relatively unique. still to this day I&#x27;m asked about my cologne, ten years on. absolutely classic.</li>
    <li> So I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about &amp;#34;this is watered down and doesn&#x27;t come in the right packaging&amp;#34; This product is mailed from Amazon Prime and from Alfred Sung, so I don&#x27;t know how it could be fake, this is also the price that would be in stores. Thank you so much! It came just in time for Valentine&#x27;s Day. Great smell too!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first when I was reading other reviewers comments about this product.  But so far I decide to take a chance and order one just to experience it for myself. I am really surprise that shipment was on par with the delivery time and I was not disappoint the product was wrapped nice and clean and also smell great.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Last a long time! A great price as well.</li>
    <li> Really smell great my wife loves the smell, will buy some more when needed.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best cologne  I have used till now, good thing is comes pretty cheap on amazon.</li>
    <li> love the smell buy more of his product</li>
    <li> an exquisite fragrance is one of my favorites, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> as usual with these cheap cologne or better say discounted : the smell is amazing ... light and strong ... yup!! the problem : wont last more than one hour ... that is my experience ... but hey all these cologne like this .. beside the expensive ones</li>
    <li> Love it! Just as expected and great size bottle for the price!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, seller excellent in shipping,made my husbands day. We love this cologne. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Hei is my favorite cologne and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years now.  The price is excellent and comparable to what I normally pay at the outlet stores.  Also, the product arrived the very next day, just in time for me to wear to an event that evening.  Super, super pleased!!</li>
