      <li>Great great product.</li>
      <li>It does not have a pleasant smell as I thought it would have.  </li>
      <li>the taste is good ,cooling in summer</li>
      <li>I feel very comfortable when I put the mask on face and the smell is so nice!</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t need cover up any more, using this in conjunction with my Rose 24hr brightening creme.</li>
      <li>Smells good , feel cool in the face.</li>
      <li>It reminded me more of how some of the gel masks feel on my face like [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>It felt more as a cream/moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>After removing it it does make my face feel moisturized and healthy.  </li>
      <li>However there is an interesting tingling/cooling sensation when I put it on that I wasn&#x27;t expecting.  </li>
      <li>The experience of having it on your skin is interesting.  </li>
      <li>To me it is more moisturizing, smells better, and feels nicer on my skin.  </li>
      <li>but it is not as pleasant as the GLAMGLOW products or First Aid Beauty.  </li>
      <li>She was a convert after a salesperson tried it on her at Sephora and continued to love it after getting a full sized container.  </li>

      <li>So it&#x27;s worth thinking about it</li>
      <li>I love using masks to mitigate my skin issues - drying masks for clearing up breakouts fast and hydrating masks to reduce the affects of aging and make my skin feel soft.  </li>
      <li>Currently my favorite masks are anything by GLAMGLOW (especially [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was the smell.  </li>
      <li>I really, really like this mask, but ultimately I like the GLAMGLOW Thirstymud better.  </li>
      <li>though I also have pretty reasonable expectations when it comes to skincare.  </li>
      <li>Ultimately it&#x27;s a really good mask even if it isn&#x27;t a clear winner for me over other luxury masks on the market.</li>
      <li>The texture was smoother and very soft.</li>
      <li>B0083S44LM First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Instant Oatmeal Mask-2 oz.]</li>
      <li>Irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Makes your skin so soft and radiant.  </li>
      <li>It did leave my skin soft after rising but nothing else.</li>
      <li>I decided to try the Fresh Black Tea Instant Perfecting mask because I have a friend who absolutely raves about it.  </li>
      <li>However, the Fresh Black Tea Instant Perfecting Mask, while having a higher price, is actually cheaper per ounce since you get 3.3 ounces in a container vs. GLAMGLOW&#x27;s 1.7.  </li>
      <li>price is an important consideration for you, especially if you don&#x27;t mind the smell or a little tingle.    </li>
      <li>It smells less like an added fragrance and more like an active ingredient.  </li>
      <li>.it is very expensive ,but its function is not so good as its price.but</li>
      <li>For context, I have skin that is dry, sensitive and also acne prone.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It does not have a pleasant smell as I thought it would have.  The product is a bit grainy and unlike any mask I have ever tried.  It felt more as a cream/moisturizer.  It did leave my skin soft after rising but nothing else.</li>
    <li> Irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I help my friend brought it she is very good.</li>
    <li> Great great product. Does what it says</li>
    <li> Whoa!  If you can afford this mask, get it!  Makes your skin so soft and radiant.  I will buy again when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> Very good mask. My face glow the next day! Best mask I used so far. Quick delivery. I will buy it again</li>
    <li> For context, I have skin that is dry, sensitive and also acne prone.  I love using masks to mitigate my skin issues - drying masks for clearing up breakouts fast and hydrating masks to reduce the affects of aging and make my skin feel soft.  I decided to try the Fresh Black Tea Instant Perfecting mask because I have a friend who absolutely raves about it.  She was a convert after a salesperson tried it on her at Sephora and continued to love it after getting a full sized container.  Currently my favorite masks are anything by GLAMGLOW (especially [[ASIN:B00ISEOY20 GLAMGLOW Thirstymud Hydrating Treatment, 1.7 oz.]] and [[ASIN:B009GYVMAS GLAMGLOW Super-MudTM Clearing Treatment 1.2 oz]]) when I can splurge and [[ASIN:B0083S44LM First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Instant Oatmeal Mask-2 oz.]] when I&#x27;m looking for something a little less expensive.  I was curious to see how this would compare.    The first thing I noticed was the smell.  I can&#x27;t quite pick out what it smells like but it is not as pleasant as the GLAMGLOW products or First Aid Beauty.  It smells less like an added fragrance and more like an active ingredient.  If you&#x27;re expecting something intentionally pleasant smelling, you might be disappointed.  The experience of having it on your skin is interesting.  Applying it to my face it smelled quite creamy and rich.  However there is an interesting tingling/cooling sensation when I put it on that I wasn&#x27;t expecting.  It reminded me more of how some of the gel masks feel on my face like [[ASIN:B000A0ADUW Ole Henriksen Blue Black Berry Enzyme Facial Mask, 3.5 Fluid Ounce]], though that product doesn&#x27;t tingle quite as much.  It isn&#x27;t painful or unpleasant, but was definitely unexpected.  Thankfully this isn&#x27;t a mask that hardens or itches so it is very pleasant in that way.    After removing it it does make my face feel moisturized and healthy.  I think it does a really nice job at this though I also have pretty reasonable expectations when it comes to skincare.  I expect them to earn their keep, but I&#x27;m not expecting a miracle cure.  Comparing this with the other products I&#x27;ve mentioned I do think from a moisturizing perspective it&#x27;s better than the First Aid Beauty Mask, but not quite as powerful as the GLAMGLOW Thirstymud.  Thankfully, the tingling sensation goes away a few minutes after you take it off and it doesn&#x27;t seem to increase my skin&#x27;s sensitivity to other products.    I really, really like this mask, but ultimately I like the GLAMGLOW Thirstymud better.  To me it is more moisturizing, smells better, and feels nicer on my skin.  However, the Fresh Black Tea Instant Perfecting Mask, while having a higher price, is actually cheaper per ounce since you get 3.3 ounces in a container vs. GLAMGLOW&#x27;s 1.7.

So it&#x27;s worth thinking about it price is an important consideration for you, especially if you don&#x27;t mind the smell or a little tingle.    Ultimately it&#x27;s a really good mask even if it isn&#x27;t a clear winner for me over other luxury masks on the market.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good! I feel very comfortable when I put the mask on face and the smell is so nice!</li>
    <li> Smells good , feel cool in the face.I&#x27;m like , my husband is also。The price is a little expensive , when there will be a discount it</li>
    <li> leaves my skin feeling moist and smoother than before using.</li>
    <li> The packaging is very poor. And the words fade on the bottle! The bottle is also bumpy!  I think the prodcts is fake!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I first got this product because it had a different scent to it than my friends department store mask.  But let me tell you after the third use I saw a big difference in my skin.  The texture was smoother and very soft. My pores were smaller and my skin appeared brighter.  I wanted to see results to my dry rough skin and I got them..</li>
    <li> it is very good as others say about it.but actually it is not so good .it is very expensive ,but its function is not so good as its price.but the taste is good ,cooling in summer</li>
    <li> I was hooked after Sephora gave me a free sample. This is the only creme that has ever given me a noticeable difference in my complexion. I don&#x27;t need cover up any more, using this in conjunction with my Rose 24hr brightening creme.</li>
