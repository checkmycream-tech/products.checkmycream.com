    <li> This is a very handy insert to a purse, messenger bag or duffle.  It makes all the little things you have to carry around quite accessible.  The only thing I would add is a closure of some sort so the insert could be lifted out and used away from the bag without spilling anything.</li>
    <li> Great bag for the car. Holds a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Many compartments to hold essential items that dont fit in handbag. Pretty color.</li>
    <li> wow a great little purse bag,so glad i baught it i sometimes carry small purses and no xtra places for items,this little helper is so nice and gives me storage to carry the xtra items i need to carry in my smaller purses,what a deal,i think im going back for more,</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other bag organizers that cost more but they were too small, too big or too flimsy. This works. I got all my stuff into it and it fits in my bags. Perfection.</li>

    <li> This purse organizer is just what it is an organizer. No more clutter in my purse and if I want to wear another purse all I have to do is take this out and put it in another purse. It is very cute and it keeps my purse nice and tidy. Great material.</li>
    <li> This is a cute little insert, but a bit smaller than I imagined. Like the color, and will find good use for it, just make sure you know it&#x27;s smaller than it appears, and will take a LONG time to get to you. Otherwise, good product at exceptionally reasonable price.</li>

    <li> Way smaller than what I need, but nice all the same.  Probably would not order it again, but feel it is well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I always look at the percentage and the price..this person happened to have both and now I know why.  Everything was great including the packaging.</li>
    <li> I imagined it bigger than what I received. Apart from that, it was a good deal (2.99$ incl shipping). It should hold everyday things like hand lotion, sanitizer, etc. and easy to transfer from one bag to another.</li>
    <li> Awesome, it is nice to be able to switch bags so easily. Price was good and it came quickly, plenty of space to store things.</li>
    <li> It is very nice to put into my bag. My mess stuff gets more organized. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> So well made, will be handy in any purse, easy to change to all me</li>
    <li> This little pouch is the handiest thing. Makes it really simple and quick to change purses. Keeps everything neat and organized.  I&#x27;m able to easily find items in my purse.  I&#x27;ve had it for awhile and it is holding up just fine.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I expected, but well made and lots of room for my make-up!</li>
    <li> I like this. It helps my purse stay organized. So often I find a purse I like but I look inside and it doesn&#x27;t have dividers or pockets, I love dividers and pockets. I can easily transfer my stuff from one purse to another.</li>
    <li> My brand name purse organizer tore and I needed to replace it,  that is when I found this one.  I am very thrilled with my purchase.  This one has so many handy little compartments for pens, chapsticks, whatever you need to organize.  I love the flap that snaps up and has a zippered compartment on it - another storage area!  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> It comes in handy since I am constantly changing purses. I can always find my things in my purse now. I ordered 2 so I gave my daughter one too. She loves it.</li>
    <li> My aunt wanted me to order this for her. She ordered a bunch of them to give out as Christmas gifts. Size,pricing,quality &amp; shipping process was excellent ... She loves it :)</li>
    <li> Shipping took FOREVER...  Bag fits great in my purse and keeps it clean!</li>
    <li> I know it is very cheap but it is very small as well, just buy it with that in mind, it will work with a small purse and no many things.</li>
    <li> Its so small it hasn&#x27;t really come in handy because it doesn&#x27;t fix well in any of my purses and falls around</li>
    <li> Just feels and looks cheap.  I purchased another purse organizer that was comparably priced though actually, and feels and looks (and functions) far superior.</li>
    <li> Ok, for the price. But not sure will fit many purses. Not very impressed But i think it would be a good gift.</li>
    <li> Wow! Had no idea when I ordered, the seller is from China.  Well, it must be coming on a &amp;#34;slow boat&amp;#34;!! I placed the order on Jan 2nd and have yet to receive it. Will not forget to check where it&#x27;s coming from in the future.</li>
    <li> I give it a four star since one of the snap cannot be snapped very well, so it is always half open of one side. Overall I think it is a good product and recommend for those who like to bring all gadgets/accessories in an organized way.</li>
    <li> This makes it much easier when switching between purses/backpacks. Not meant for a tiny purse, but it keeps the inside of my purse relatively more organized than it normally would be. It is much easier to dig around for things in my bag now.</li>
    <li> As described-Good packaging-Fast shipping-Well made-Very happy with item &amp; Seller-Would deal with again!! A++++</li>
    <li> This item has helped my purse a great deal. I got this smaller one just to be sure Iike the concept and it works for me. I am a very picky person and this satisfied me greatly. Very happy I ordered them. I got one for my friend as well and she loves it too. I carry lots of things in my purse so I believe in the near future I will be ordering a bigger one.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday! organizes very well and is very handy. I can just take it from bag to bag with ease!</li>
