    <li> These nails are perfect! I do nail art and wanted to stop paying over $20 for a pack of 30 nails. This might even be better! It comes in little bags labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. I don&#x27;t think that the sizes are smallest to greatest. I think it&#x27;s for each finger (0 is pinky, 1 is ring finger etc).</li>
    <li> i really like these.  they are a bit thicker which i like for the way i do my nails, they hold up better.  i like receiving each size in its own bag.  some of the nails are a bit unevenly shaped but for the price and all things considered i will continue to order.</li>
    <li> Nails are a little thin feeling, but I only bought them for practice (not for peoples hands).  Great deal, would recommend.</li>
    <li> Not the salon style half nails I was looking for</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in great condition.  The nails appear to be strong and sturdy.  I work a lot with my hands and need strong tips that won&#x27;t split under pressure.  These look as if they will work out just fine.  I will update if problems present at a later date.</li>
    <li> These are NOT tips!!! They are full length nails. Very disappointed that i waited 31/2 weeks for the wrong item!!</li>
    <li> hello everyone if you are into nail art like me and want a sturdy and grade A quality product well these nails are it. omg these are the best nail tips money can buy. Now lets be clear don&#x27;t get theses nail tips and then leave a negative review for them.  people when you are doing acrylic nails at home or a salon remember this the tip only adds length not strength too the nail. please make sure your bead consistency is right not too dry and not too wet and research on how to apply acrylic too the nails you do not apply it like nail polish. there are three zones the nail its the tip then the stress point also called smile line then the top get some practice wheels from amazon and practice making the proper bead consistency first and how too use acrylic nail brush. my friends if you learn these steps you will be amazed at your skill level in doing your own nails</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s not what I thought it was going to be.  Instead of getting nail tips, got got full nails. Very dissapointed.</li>

    <li> It took them 4 months to ship this to me...I was a little disappointed when they finally arrived. They look as advertised, but are on the flimsy side. I make do because I know how to apply the acrylic to make it last.</li>
