      <li>This is an outstanding value.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>

      <li>its an ok brush wish the bristles were softer</li>
      <li>Love the brush.  </li>

      <li>I love it, good designed and not expensive.</li>

      <li>So this is great so far</li>
      <li>Great Brush nice long handle and durable brush.</li>
      <li>and it seems like this brush is easy to use.</li>

      <li>The brush itself is rather nice, but the wood brush area split after the first use and bristles are beginning to fall out.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s evident whoever is trying to sell this hasn&#x27;t even looked at their own product.</li>
      <li>Their items are reasonably priced so that everyone can enjoy the fun, innovative and feel good</li>
      <li>It works just fine</li>
      <li>but it works just fine.</li>
      <li>The factory that put it together needs to use better nails and super glue.</li>
      <li>so it just goes to show that this thing is made very cheaply, which by the price, you get what you pay for but it isn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, this is a replacement, and I still have the handle from its predecessor, which works just fine.</li>
      <li>It has a nice large handle.</li>
      <li>, it was a cheap brush</li>
      <li>This is worth the price and more.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy having this.  </li>
      <li>sound,  </li>
      <li>Nice brush just not put together very well.</li>
      <li>once the head falls off you can see how cheaply this is made.</li>
      <li>I was excited to get this in the mail.</li>
      <li>My Husband is real pleased with it, now I won&#x27;t have to wash his back.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Most of my reviews are sarcastic and humorless. Not so with this review, its just plain garbage, both the product and my review that is. Broke within 12.6568050 seconds of opening with a simple back scratch tryout, poor design and weak at brush handle attachment, no amount of glue would work to fix, too bad and so sad, looked like nice bristles. Sent back to Amazon. Sad, sad, day....still so sad.</li>
    <li> With in a week it has mildew stain on it.</li>
    <li> Does a great job! Gets to those hard to reach spots on your back.. Feels wonderful. Almost like someone is doing it for you.</li>
    <li> I would have to recommend that you do NOT buy this brush.  The brush itself is great; nice bristles, sturdy enough yet soft enough (my brush does not have the white plastic bristle bed.  This one has the bristles inserted directly into the wooden head.)  The Bad: after eight weeks of use the handle broke at the grip where the material was narrowed to accommodate the grip.  The grip is nice but not necessary and I just noticed that there is mold blackening under the grip.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible brush. The people who make this brush should be ashamed of themselves! The head just flew off the handle while I was in the shower. I noticed that it was held on by two tiny nails and maybe a little glue. This apparently was not sufficient. I will try to glue it myself now, and see if it holds. I recommend that you do not buy this brush!</li>
    <li> Unusually flimsy product.  The wood is of such poor quality that the handle cracked after only a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Yes, it is far reaching. But the bristles are rather short and not very stiff. Great for a woman, but not for a guy who likes a good strong scrub.</li>
    <li> This piece of junk back scrubber had small cracks in the wood upon arrival and the head broke off from the handle (it&#x27;s only affixed by cheap wood staples)after only two uses. What a worthless product! I will never buy an Earth Therapeutics product ever again.</li>
    <li> The seller described this as having boars hair bristles and it doe not. Very disappointed because this was the main reason for me to buy this brush. It has not been used yet but most all the other reviews tell of the head cracking after one week. If so This items should be removed for sale. Guess we will find out.</li>
    <li> Within 4 days of first touching water, the wood at the base of the bristles showed fissures and cracks, and then began to turn black (mildew?). Clearly, this brush is not well-designed to cope with water, which is where the product is supposed to be used, unfortunately. It did not crack, but I did not use it long enough to get to that point. I could see how if it got much more warped, it would crack and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to fit the removable brush head back onto the handle. Threw it away. I wonder if plastic brushes would do better. I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> This is a brush for scrubbing one&#x27;s back.  How much can one say about a back brush?  Easy to hold, bristles are not too firm, not too soft.  It works, and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Really pretty, nicely crafted, and quite solidly made. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the bristles were just a little stiffer (they&#x27;re fine, just a bit soft for me).</li>
    <li> Currently I have had this brush about a month. After 6 uses the handle broke off from the green part to the end where the rope goes through the handle which cut the handle to about 1/2 it&#x27;s size. I purchased this for it&#x27;s \\&quot;Far reaching\\&quot; length. I can no longer use it for what I purchased this for. I drilled a hole in what was left of the handle &amp; glued the brush head to make it more secure to the handle &amp; am using it for much shorter chores. I would not recommend Earth Therapeautics Erogo Form Far Reaching Brush.</li>
    <li> this product is nice, i used it to scrub my back every night but after purchasing it and on the second day, the head fell off the stick and i had to super glue it back together. The factory that put it together needs to use better nails and super glue.</li>
    <li> Yes. this correct. I had been using this brush for years now, but what I do is add to the back of the brush (3) 3/4 inch flathead  aluminum screws. Very simple to install. This will keep the connection between the brush and handle in place. Glue by itself does not last. So, once your finished with the old brush , take off the screws from it, (they won&#x27;t rust cause there aluminum)and install them on your new brush. So, stay clean , Retired Early</li>
    <li> This is yet another disappointment.  I have purchased four back brushes in the last few months.  Three have broken almost immediately. Each was made in China and, after close examination, they are made of very thin material under the rubbery grip.  This one has not broken yet, but it is made in China and has very thin material under the grip (same location the others broke).  The brush itself is rather nice, but the wood brush area split after the first use and bristles are beginning to fall out.  I give it another week at most.  I think Fuller, while very expensive, is probably the best value.  Stores need to recognize the junk and stop pushing it to us as consumers.  And we, as consumers, need to stand up and rebel against this type of garbage.</li>
    <li> The brush head cracked the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;This is a junk item</li>
    <li> This brush was exactly what I was looking for!  Imagine my disappointment when the very first time I used it, the handle broke in the area under the rubber grip!  I tried gluing the handle, but that lasted for less than 1 use.</li>
    <li> Stop!  DO NOT PURCHASE!  It&#x27;s not often that you see a product with as many one star reviews as five star reviews.  Based on that I was some what reluctant to purchase this item, but since it was only about $7.00 thought why not give it a try.  What a mistake.  The brush cracked in two places the very first time it was used.  Probably the poorest quality item I have ever purchased. A complete waste of seven dollars (not worth the effort of trying to get a refund).  I have other Earth Therapeutics items that I love.  The concept of this brush is fine, but the implementation is lousy.  WHAT A SHAME</li>
    <li> broke within a week. DON&#x27;T BUY!!!</li>
    <li> The shaft on this brush is made of plastic and will break upon use. I do not recommend it. The brush would be much better if the shaft were made of wood.</li>
    <li> After only TWO days hanging in the shower, the wooden head split open and the bristles began falling on the floor.  The wood is very cheap so buy a plastic brush.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed.  The specs says it is 21.5&amp;#34; long when it is actually 18&amp;#34; long.  I was hoping for a longer brush.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it because the bristles felt too stiff at first but after using it for a week they softened a bit and it works and feels great now.  Handle is long enough and I like the little string so it can easily hang from a hook on in my shower.</li>
    <li> Nice brush just not put together very well. There is room for improvement!</li>
    <li> This brush lasted about a month (about 25 uses) until the bristles were gone; thus, although it was cheap, I didn&#x27;t realize it would be disposable! The wood continues to endure, but the business part, the bristles, are now completely useless.</li>
    <li> Nice big brush. Works great. I would recommend. Can use wet or dry. Just use soap to wash and let air dry.</li>
    <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the description because I wanted a body scrub brush.  This brush is way too soft and light to be used for exfoliating the skin either wet or dry.  I guess I misread the description.</li>
    <li> Does a wonderful job of reaching all my back.</li>
    <li> Long handle for lower back and toes with bristles soft but firm make a shower a great experience.  Operative words are \\&quot;long handle\\&quot; and bristles just right...not too soft.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This all natural bath back brush is a great find!  And a great price.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy having this.  works great!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush with fairly low expectations. I assumed I would get a brush that would last for a few months at which time I would buy another one. This brush got wet one time and the next day the head of the brush split and several of the bristle inserts fell out. I decided I could deal with that, it was a cheap brush and it was still useable. After the second time the brush got wet the head of the brush fell off of the handle. My recommendation is to spend an extra $5 and buy a brush that is higher quality.</li>
    <li> We looked all over for a back brush that has a long handle and found this one.My Husband is real pleased with it, now I won&#x27;t have to wash his back.</li>
    <li> The brush that was mailed to me was by this manufacturer but didn&#x27;t look like the one in the picture as it had a gel-like plastic on the handle. On the second useage while scrubbing my back, the arm of it snapped in half. I am not a big or very strong person so it just goes to show that this thing is made very cheaply, which by the price, you get what you pay for but it isn&#x27;t worth the hassle. I definitely would not buy this brand of brush again.</li>
    <li> Snapped in two with the first use.  It&#x27;s made with particle board.  There is NO WAY they designed this brush thinking they were providing a quality, marketable product.  They sell it (probably primarily by mail) and hope that you&#x27;ll just live with it.  They never responded to my emails, but when I notified Amazon.com of their lack of response and what a ripoff Earth Therapeutics was I had a refund notice withing a couple of hours.  So in summary, Earth Therapeutics sucks, but Amazon.com is AWESOME!</li>
    <li> Good quality and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> It did not come with the gel handle either. I still try to use it as a scrub and it works so far, but i cant reach my back as well anymore. The single staple that they used is poking out right now so i have to be wary of that as I shower.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush 8/13/2010; for a brush costing less than $10 it was a good brush. This brush was used daily for a year (it broke 8/31/2011) till the handle broke at the end that you hold it at. I had no issues with the brush during the past year. Would I recommend it? Yeap - for the price. I&#x27;m actually getting another one as I write this review. UPDATE 2/12/2012 - Well the one I purchased in 9/2011 just broke - and get this - at the same spot as the last one. I really think this brush has a design flaw. I decided to get a diffrent brush this time, it&#x27;s getting old having this brush break.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect brush and this particular type is hard to find now. Long wooden handle with a rubber grip, natural bristles that rinse easily and stay fresh. Looks great too. I&#x27;ll be enjoying this for a long time. Exceptional price too. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> First time I used brush head fell off. Would have re-glued it but stick end was warped.  Definitely don&#x27;t waste your money. Trash</li>
    <li> I love it. I am tall and the long handle allows me to reach my entire back. Love the stiff bristles.</li>
    <li> Sturdy brush head and handle. Length is good, maybe a little too long for my taste actually. Rubber grip is helpful. Bristle clusters are dense and therefore stiff, but soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle and brush head are not bare wood; they are finished with a protective coating which makes it very difficult to grip the brush anywhere other than the non-slip grip if your hands are soapy (for instance if you want to grip the head or near the head to scrub a body part that doesn&#x27;t require a long reach).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush-head/handle connection is loose after only 1 use, although it seems to be holding on somehow. Expect I&#x27;ll have to glue it soon. After only 2 uses, both ends of the brush head are showing 1/2\\&quot; crack (edge toward center).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At purchased price of $10, would not recommend or buy again. At $6, maybe, if it holds up at least 3 months.</li>
    <li> this brush has the right level of firmness and it&#x27;s easy to maneuver. I always keep a second on tap.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but I received it with a somewhat worn brand label, making it appear that it was not properly imprinted into the wood.  The brush is fairly tough on the skin, which fortunately was what I was looking for, but I wanted to post that here for other shoppers so they know what to expect, in case it is not what they want.</li>
    <li> Back Brush Far Reaching - BRUSH,(Earth Therapeutics) is exellent.  Nice firm bristles, long handle for reaching back, well made and reasonably priced.  Finally, I have something that won&#x27;t break easily and does the job well.</li>
    <li> The bath brush we had got damaged and I was looking for a replacement.  I like mine with a long handle (at least 18 in), sturdy bristles, and well made.  I really like the addition of the enhanced handle.  It makes it easier to hang onto.  I&#x27;m really liking this brush.</li>
    <li> Well, I should have read all these bad reviews before I bought this lousy product. My bad. Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time on this brush. I have used my new back brush a total of 3 times. Today in the shower, the brush broke completely off the handle. I literally received it 5 days ago. Bummer. Obviously I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying this brush.</li>
    <li> Opened the package and the bristles were falling out, then after the first use, the brush cracked right down the bristles. So disappointed! DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I have owned other shower brushes, however this one is the best I have had so far.&lt;br /&gt;It has a non slip portion on the handle and the length is perfect for reaching all areas of the back.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> The handle could be just a few more inches longer... otherwise, all else is well as far as quality is concerned. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these types of wooden brushes in the past, and they have lasted a long time.  The only reason for replacement has been because they tend to get a tad moldy even with good care, due to aging and exposure to constant dampness.  This brush didn&#x27;t even have a chance to get that old.  The first one developed a crack within 2 weeks of purchase, and shed many of the bristles, and it was definitely never dropped - always hung with care in the shower.  I took it back and the store replaced it for free.  The second one lasted barely a month and now it has suddenly developed a crack down the middle like the first one, and is also losing bristles.  I will try to superglue the crack before it gets any bigger but I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  Bottom line:  Go with another brand.  Btw, Earth Therapeutics products are made in China. &#x27;Nuff said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  6 days later, after applying superglue to the crack, it seems to have stopped the loss of bristles and the extension of THAT crack.  Now, however, there are other cracks developing along the lines of the inner bristles.  It&#x27;s a little harder to get drops of superglue down in between the rows without getting it on the bristles themselves.  I suppose if one were to coat the entire white plastic part with a thin layer of superglue the brush might last longer.  But should consumers have to do that in order to have a bath brush last longer than a month??  Is this what we&#x27;re reduced to with the lowering of product standards?  Pathetic. I&#x27;m done with Earth Therapeutics.</li>
    <li> The handle came off the very first use leaving two brads sticking out . The head is cracked and bristles are falling out.. It is NOT ergonomically designed.</li>
    <li> I bought about three others before getting this one. Nothing spectacular unless you take into account how hard it is to just find a simple well made product that actually looks in person like you expect.  Perfect simple well made back brush.</li>
    <li> THERE ARE NO OTHER BATH BRUSHES ON THE MARKET LIKE THIS ONE.  THE BRISTLES ARE RIGHT, THE LENGHTH AND CURVE OF THE HANDLE ARE PERFECT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give this product a ZERO star rating if I could.  I&#x27;ve had several of these in the past that were great but they had a soft plastic grip handle wrapped around the wooden base.  I didn&#x27;t know Earth Therapeutics had discontinued this item and now only stocks a pure wooden handle which is VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when holding the brush sideways or from the bottom of your back with a upward motion.  Several vendors here still show the green plastic handle but do not be fooled, you&#x27;ll get a wooden handle that is anything but ergonomic, I contacted Earth Therapeutics via email to confirm and the product now being shipped does not contain the soft plastic grip, only a wooded handle.  I addition, they are now driving a nail into the brush and handle in an attempt to keep the brush from coming off the handle.  This has resulted in the brush splitting within 2 months on both brushes as the nails will no longer hold the brushes to their handles, which also poses a risk of injury from the nail in the handle.  In essence, the brushes were useful for only two months.  In the end they were rather hazardous, an expensive and unsafe endeavor for what was once a great product</li>
    <li> Therapeutics Far Reaching Bath Brush is the best in their line of bathing brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The upside: Lasts a long time. The downside: May crack (but did not break and is still usable). This is one of the nicest natural bristle bath brushes available and great for those hard to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important note to remember: when exfoliating skin with a natural bristle brush do not use more than 3-4 days per week, to allow skin time to recover and boost collagen, and to avoid bruising skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall A sound buy. B+/A- or Four Stars!</li>
    <li> It works just fine but when I ordered it I was sure it was for the rubber grip handle model.</li>
    <li> Like the the it is natural.  The plastic brissels tend to scratch your back.  This brush does not!  My back feels great!</li>
    <li> The brush feels good on your face, chest, tail-end, feet and etc. in the shower. Easily helps remove dead and dried out skin from your feet....</li>
    <li> This brush was pictured to have an ergonomic handle but it does not! The handle is all wood and not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Slips out of hand. Needs rubber on handle to improve grip.</li>
    <li> it was ok.i like the other earth therapeutics products as well.Maybe i will try the soap at a later time.</li>
    <li> I selected the same brush I bought two years ago, but the handle did not have the convenient rubber grip handle as the original one had. Rather a disappointment. The handle supposedly can be removed from the brush but I am not able to remove it or I would exchange the handle from my original brush. The brush, itself, is good, however. Bill King</li>
    <li> Update (3/24/13)  It is almost four months since I purchased this, and I am still happy with it.  I don&#x27;t see any signs of the deterioration that some of the other reviewers reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of all the negative reviews here on Amazon.  So, far, I haven&#x27;t found any of those negative things in my use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I suspect possible bogus reviews, or someone with a grudge or other purpose, although Amazon says they were verified buyers.  When there are a lot of negative reviews, I think Amazon should investigate the validity, and either drop the product if they are valid, or take some action to limit or notate reviews that are highly suspect.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was one small issue -- the plastic label that is embedded in the blue soft rubber on the handle was not securely attached -- it was just a peg on the back, pushed into the rubber.  So, I put a drop of superglue on it, and it hasn&#x27;t been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that there was a hole drilled entirely through the handle at this point, which could potentially weaken the handle, but it is only about 3/16 inch or less, so not significant I think.  Nevertheless, it is unnecessary, so could be eliminated in a future revision of manufacture.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this brush some time back, but never used it. She gave it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head was cracked when I received it, and the head was wobbling annoyingly on the handle.  The head was attached to the handle by two screws that were so short as to be useless.  The two dabs of glue holding the head to the handle were the wrong kind of glue for wood, and did not do much good either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try to repair the brush just to get a bit of use out of it. I sanded the wood and epoxied the head to the handle, followed by a coat of spar varnish on the wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush was a nice concept in using natural materials (wood and natural bristle), but the manufacturing process left this brush useless without extensive repair.  What a waste of good materials!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these from a brick and mortar bath store years ago, and it served me so well that once I&#x27;d worn the bristles flat, I bought another here on Amazon. In the meantime, however, someone had decided that it was sufficient to attach the brush to the handle with nothing more than two thin metal brads, evidently shot-through from the brush side. I&#x27;d like to shake this person by the short bristles and tell them that this is in NO WAY sufficient. The brush head loosens after one or two uses. I sent my first brush back, thinking it must have been a goof at the factory. But the second came attached the same crappy way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is that the rest of the product is awesome. Great bristles, good reach, rubberized grip -- all the reasons my prior brush served me well for years. So with my replacement, I ripped the handle off the brads (not hard), pulled the brads out of the brush head with pliers (threw them away), and reattached the brush head with wood glue. The handle slides perfectly into the groove in the brush head, and with wood glue creates a very solid fit. Months later, the brush head shows no signs of ever falling off again.</li>
    <li> Still giving it 4 stars because the Brussels are not too soft or too hard, the handle is also long enough to reach all areas of the back.  I have used it less than a dozen times and the one nail that kept the handle attached to the brush won&#x27;t stay on.  It fell off before and I could reattach it, but now it won&#x27;t stay on.  I think I could fix it though, and still use it, by adding glue and more nails better placed than the one tiny one it came with.</li>
    <li> Great as a back gentle back scratcher dry too.</li>
    <li> Would not even give it a star.&lt;br /&gt;Broke on the first use. Do Not Buy This Item. Product is a RIP OFF.</li>
    <li> The only suggestion I would make is to make the end of the area being held round. It is difficult to hold a flat smooth surface in a soapy hand and not have it turn while trying to scrub.  Otherwise the brush and angle are great.</li>
    <li> Great Brush nice long handle and durable brush.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this in the mail.But my excitement ended abruptly today in the shower when the Head came off. once the head falls off you can see how cheaply this is made. The head was attached to the handle with 1 small staple with about 1/8th inch of it expected to hold the head in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY...</li>
    <li> Just as expected! really enjoying it</li>
    <li> This company surprizes me with they&#x27;re very poor customer service.&lt;br /&gt;When the brush head cracked, making it un-usable, all they would say is:\\&quot; It is not our problem.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Well, this products started out great, but it quickly began to give my husband problems, because the brush wasn&#x27;t stiff enough when wet.  Then it dropped off the hook on the wall, and the head broke off the handle.  It was about a month old.  It had very thin staples holding on the brush that were beginning to rust.  It was not made well at all in my opinion for the shower.</li>
    <li> perfect, I was looking for a long handled brush and this is great, the bristles are just right.</li>
    <li> Wood gets damaged easily.</li>
    <li> I used it once and it broke in two pieces.  The head is attached to the handle with a very small metal staple that is not sufficient for long term use.  It was very inexpensive so I guess you get what you pay for.  I will not be returning to Earh Therapeutics in the future.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend who has some issues with his back breaking out and just in a week his back is so much better. It&#x27;s a little too firm but it works just fine. It&#x27;s sturdy and it was a great deal. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Brush is made of wood and the head split after 1 use. Brush should be made of a water resistant material. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> Great quality brush after about a year the brush came off the stick!</li>
    <li> This brush lasted 1 week!!! The brush head is attached to the arm by a very small staple---1 week into use it separated.&lt;br /&gt;This is a piece of junk!!! Do not buy!!</li>
    <li> The Brush has excellent reach.However after only a few uses the wood is already starting to split.&lt;br /&gt;I dont know how long it will last</li>
    <li> I have been using it for less than a month and the wood handle has split.  should not be used near water - but then isn&#x27;t supposed to be a bath brush?  I&#x27;m not sure what they were thinking.</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised. Handle is long and doesn&#x27;t slip in soapy hands. Seller delivered promptly, and has good correspondence. Bristles are a little rough, but they may soften with time.</li>
    <li> The brush head came off the first time used.  DO NOT BUY!  I usually read reviews and apparently did not on this item.  My Bad.</li>
    <li> Had the brush for a week or so and the head has fallen off the handle already.  Glued it back to together and seems fine now.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush.  Good grip. Sturdy bristles.  No frills - just a good product.  Mostly wood and bristles, bery little plastic for a change.</li>
    <li> I did not order this but bought it at Target. The brush fibers came out after 3rd use. Brush head keeps coming apart. Won&#x27;t ever buy again.</li>
    <li> For an $8 brush this company charges $5.95. I would suggest buyers look to other companies that use more reasonable shipping rates.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this item. The bristles felt good, but in following the directions to gently tap excess water off of the brush after use, the brush head came off in less than 5 uses. It was impossible to reattach as well. I bought a similar two-sided back scrubber made by the same company in a grocery store, and the head came off that one after only a couple of weeks as well. I would not recommend this company&#x27;s products to anyone.</li>
    <li> So as far as the brush and bristles go, I like this. The bristles aren&#x27;t too hard or two soft, and it is pretty great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the handle sucks. It broke with only light pressure after about 2 weeks, and you can see many others have had the same problem. I have no idea how these other people with the high ratings actually use this thing without breaking it.</li>
    <li> Handle snapped in half after 6 weeks and maybe 15 separate uses. Maybe a total of 15 minutes of use before it broke. I have used brushes like this one for years. This was junk. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> quick delivery, good quality brush, has worked well, use it most every day and its holding up well so there you go</li>
    <li> Head and handle seperated after just a few uses. Two pieces of wood wedged together, I don&#x27;t even think they used glue, or at least weren&#x27;t clever enough to use waterproof glue. The bristles were very soft too, not stiff enough for exfoliation or even a good back-scratching feeling.</li>
    <li> This brush is terriific. It is much longer than the average one and I can reach everywhere on my body easily. It is well made and quite sturdy. I often use it just to scratch my back without even being in the shower.It has a nice large handle. A good buy. You will be pleased.</li>
    <li> I just love the back brush it helps to get th e small areas behind you when you shower. Wonderful product</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a similar one that got from BB&amp;B a couple years ago. Looks like quality has gone way downhill. It&#x27;s head cracked longitudinally after its first visit to the shower. It is going back to be with its cracked brothers and sisters tomorrow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave this one be and do what I am doing now: find one that has a good review.</li>
    <li> i like these  I dont know why i have to write more to get this in, it is stupid and makes many now want to even write</li>
    <li> Thank you for contacting me. -handle a bit slippery... Dialogue</li>
    <li> I like this brush.  The bristles are nice and soft and I like the soft hand grip. I think it will last as well.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we wanted. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great brush! Just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> GREAT BRUSH WITH THE REACH I NEEDED.</li>
    <li> I love it ! It&#x27;s perfect.  : )</li>
    <li> This brush hangs in our shower &amp; is used for cleaning our backs, scrubing down the shower walls or scratching any itch that is unreachable.</li>
    <li> I love it at first. But then it starts to rot away. I am not sure what i am doing wrong. I shower every days and it hangs on the hook inside the shower. I have an open shower so there is enough air for it to dry out between usage. I also have heating in there in winter. So I don&#x27;t really understand why this is happening.</li>
    <li> This is much easier to use than throwing the wash cloth between my shoulder blades and working back and forth!  I am average size and I think it would even work for a tall man.</li>
    <li> I love it, good designed and not expensive. Their items are reasonably priced so that everyone can enjoy the fun, innovative and feel good</li>
    <li> Great gift item.  I gave this brush to my daughter.  She loves it.  She uses it a lot in the shower.</li>
    <li> It arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was as described.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wooden bath brush to replace one that I&#x27;d had for about three years and had become discolored and permanently mold-stained. In my quest to find a natural wooden brush that wouldn&#x27;t mold (which perhaps isn&#x27;t possible), I decided to try this partially-plastic one. Bad choice. In about 14 days of gentle use, the plastic had cracked all over the place, lost a ton of bristles with every use (picking them from your body and drain/bathtub floor/shower walls is an annoying activity), and was quite moldy. Seriously, don&#x27;t bother, it&#x27;s not worth $10 for maybe a few weeks of use. Most reviews here and on Drugst0re.c0m are negative. I did contact the company, which wrote me back and said to supply them with the receipt. I got rid of the receipt after about a week, so no chance of a refund... The all-natural one I used for three years was an Ecot00ls. I just ordered a new one. p.s. They are apparently deleting customer photos of this product so that you can&#x27;t see just how bad their product is. I&#x27;ve uploaded several photos of the split, immediately moldy brush, and they have all mysteriously disappeared, quickly.</li>
    <li> The product is great in performance, but using it in a shower creates water damage causing discoloration and cracks in wood.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this brush for months....flawless......i bought two...glad i did</li>
    <li> Giving one Star was Generous!  Product arrived in a timely manner and looked to be very sturdy. After the first use the brush was already cracking near the bottom of the brush part close to the handle. After 4 uses in less than a week its already cracking at both ends of the brush part. Made in China and Don&#x27;t waste Your Money!  &amp;#34;Buy American so Americans Work!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It is the product I expected, but I don&#x27;t know why these brush heads are nailed to the handles, as well as glued.  Part of the utility of this type of scrub brush is the versatility in being able to use it without the handle.  With this one, I had to break the handle off, then use vicegrips to remove the nails.  I only need the handle for scrubbing the middle of my back, and so without the handle it&#x27;s 90% effective.  Fortunately, this is a replacement, and I still have the handle from its predecessor, which works just fine.</li>
    <li> I used this brush 2 times and it broke in half . I would not recommend this brush . Purchase at your own risk .</li>
    <li> Finally I found a brush that will reach where I want it to.  A my age I needed a longer handle.</li>
    <li> Grew black mold on the brush in three days hanging on the shower head.  Brush was also VERY soft and didn&#x27;t scrub well.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding value. The bristles are medium/firm but not scratchy. The handle is plenty long, easily reaching the middle of your back, and the wood handle has a good feel to it.  The only negative, as with all of these removable handle brushes, is that the handle will eventually come loose. I solve this with a dab of silicone rubber adhesive.</li>
    <li> It works good for your back and for your feet. Good massage and cleansing. This replaced an old worn out brush.</li>
    <li> update, now that this brush has been used for a while, the bristles have softened up and it is now soft enought to use on my back. when the time comes I will purchase another    This is the 3rd brush in more than seven years, the previous two were excellent, and I could use them on most of my body This brush is just a bit too abrasive than the prior two and unfortunately I can only use it on my feet.  Just not what they use to be.</li>
    <li> I was unhappy with this back brush because I thought I was ordering an ergonomic back brush which is so much easier on your hands if you have arthritis. I kept it because it does scrub well enough.  The bristles don&#x27;t seem as soft or sturdy like aforementioned ergonomic mode;. So in the end it&#x27;s always you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> 1 use and it&#x27;s broken,  I used it in the shower for one quick scrub  get done and as I am toweling off I hear this  &amp;#34;tink&amp;#34; sound,  i just had this feeling it was the brush and sure enough upon inspection  the head spit as it was just  sitting there  LOL&lt;br /&gt; . I will also mention I was hoping it was longer than the 18&amp;#34; stated on the page since Amazon has the product dimensions as 21.5 inches (I was hoping the handle was 18&amp;#34; and the brush head was 3.5&amp;#34; but once again the product description was wrong and the over all is 18&amp;#34; .  I am clicking the returns button after I submit this review</li>
    <li> iT MET MY EXPTATIONS IN ALL WAYS .  i WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS  THE DESIGN AND QUALITY OF THE BRISTLES EXCELLENT. jp</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, price was right and product is exactly as described and what I wanted.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Love the brush.  This is my second one and I searched for this specific one</li>
    <li> I bought this brush just four months ago. Last week, the handle fell off. After seeing how it was attached, I&#x27;m surprised it lasted this long. There were just two tiny nails holding the handle to the brush, and those were so close together there may as well have only been one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t believe the product description that suggests the handle can be bent to the \\&quot;desired shape.\\&quot; It&#x27;s WOOD! It&#x27;s evident whoever is trying to sell this hasn&#x27;t even looked at their own product.</li>
    <li> With all of the negative comments I was sure this brush would fall apart upon the first use. However it was instead a pleasant experience. It seems the wood has been waterproofed as the water beaded up quite a bit. The bristles seemed to stay in place and were not harsh but rather soft and only slightly scratchy. I&#x27;ve had other brushes that mildewed fast and that will probably happen to this brush if you don&#x27;t hang it up to dry. I like the ergonomic grip handle and it seems like this brush is easy to use. I will say however that when I bought the brush I didn&#x27;t notice the nail sticking out of the handle part by the brush. I had to pull out the nail. It looked like the nail had been nailed in from the wrong side of the handle. I can&#x27;t explain it but it was just something I had to fix before using this brush. I like that the brush head can be seperated from the handle but if you prefer you could glue it on with some wood glue. So this is great so far but I&#x27;ll be back to tell you if it falls apart and how long it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have been using this for a month and it is still great. 6/14/2013</li>
    <li> Was not what I had expected. Have a EARTH Therapeutics back brush, purchase 2 years ago &amp; thought it would be the same</li>
    <li> This is my second Earth Therapeutics brush. The first one finally got too gunky to trust, and while bleaching helps, it&#x27;s not perfect because the track the removeable brush is on gets water in but not out &amp; gets black. Plus the wooden head of these brushes tend to split in time. The brush is a decent stiffness and size. The only thing this one lacks is a grip on the handle to reduce slipperiness, thus 4 stars, not 5. I bought the same brand intentionally because the first one was good.</li>
    <li> I ordered two, and these are the best I have bought in years!</li>
    <li> This brush is not a well made brush.  It is two piece and doesn&#x27;t hold together.  Not recommended to anyone, even for the price.</li>
    <li> This natural bristle brush is one of the best back scrubbing instruments I have ever owned. it has a solid handle in a comfortable grip that allows you to give the force needed to really scrub your back.</li>
    <li> First one I got was cracked where the bristles are. It was replaced and it&#x27;s been wonderful. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Its hard to handle, the brush should come out of the stick.</li>
    <li> This product lasted exactly 3 uses.  The handle broke and the head is starting to crack.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend spending a few more bucks and getting something that will last a least 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  To Amazons credit I was given a charge back.</li>
    <li> poorly built. brush head came off after 2nd use. appeared to be attached to handle with not much adhesive or just some sort of staple</li>
    <li> its an ok brush wish the bristles were softer</li>
    <li> nice brush. I like wooden back brushes</li>
    <li> The Earth Therapeutics Far Reaching Natural Bristle Brush is a great product for body brushing. I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I like the brush and the bristles. Came slightly cracked, but can&#x27;t tell if that is part of the design. Has lasted so far but concerned about how long it will hold up with that crack in there. Also leaves space for mold to possibly grow :(</li>
    <li> great quality for an inexpensive brush&lt;br /&gt;lasting over 3 months so far and no bristles falling out or wood looking bad&lt;br /&gt;great product</li>
    <li> Save your money. The finish on the brush is not good. The brush started to mold and mildew within a few days. Cleaned and cleaned but it would not come out. Had discontinue use after just a few weeks. Poor product.</li>
    <li> Not only did the brush keep falling off the handle, after about 2 weeks the handle broke whilr I was using it.</li>
    <li> It worked good for a while, but the wood on the brush soon cracked and the handle fell off.  It would be a great brush if it never got wet.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the product because within a week of using it the wood split and I had to glue the splits in the wood to avoid the bristles from falling out.  I feel that it did not stand up to the cost of the product.</li>
    <li> Only had it for a few days but I like it fine so far</li>
    <li> Perfect for scrubbing your back. Handle just the right length!</li>
    <li> This is a good, quality brush. The craftsmanship of this wooden brush is top notch. The bristles are just right. The handle reaches all the right places. This is worth the price and more. It is nice to feel like I got what I paid for. Thank you and hope this helps.</li>
    <li> good materials. a little rough at first but within 2-3 uses the bristles softened up to the perfect rigidity. would buy again.</li>
    <li> thank you amazon love it it reaches my back soft and just perfect</li>
    <li> The handle drops off the brush end within a week. I can&#x27;t figure out why the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t fix this problem.</li>
    <li> after being unable to find a comparable brush in stores I found this on amazon&lt;br /&gt;on first use the natural bristles felt so good on my back I used on my whole body-buy it!</li>
    <li> On the plus side, bristles are very nice, length is very nice.  Head cracked after one use, typical with what others seem to be experiencing.  Really a bummer too, as it seems like a very nice brush otherwise.  Only used it like 3 times yet, so don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s something that will cause a critical failure or not, will contact Amazon on Monday about a replacement.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush and most likely will order another in the near future as a gift. I also recieved this product in a timely fashion...thank you</li>
