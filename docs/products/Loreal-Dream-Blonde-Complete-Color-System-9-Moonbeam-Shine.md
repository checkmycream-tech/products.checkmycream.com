      <li>I have never felt compelled to write a review before, but I am so pleased with the results of this product I just felt I needed to share my experience.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;She told me about Everpure, both shampoo and conditioner which would work more like the post-treament shine which was in this box.</li>

      <li>: Nice ingredients, but no longer being made as a complete system.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using 8G, Light Golden Blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>: Nice ingredients, but no longer being made as a complete system.</li>
      <li>It makes me so happy to know that I can get the exact color that I want without having to go to a professional AND thinking about how much money I saved by doing my color myself at home.</li>
      <li>, they all lightened my hair but left a brassy colour, I just dyed my hair last night with this product and it is wonderful!</li>
      <li>i am so very pleased with the turnout.. and it is so much better than my last professional job I can&#x27;t tell you!</li>
      <li>Certainly worth the money</li>
      <li>Blonde Moonbeam Shine gives me a great natural color.</li>
      <li>Unlike before when I wished to lighten my Med golden blond hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the color i&#x27;ve been looking for oh, and also it didn&#x27;t give just one solid color but gave a nice color range  </li>
      <li>Just the right color with no brass or ash.</li>
      <li>The color is better than all of the professional weaves that I had over 25 years -- really!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always left with a beautiful light blonde shade and glossy, soft hair.</li>
      <li>, i highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s well worth the money!</li>
      <li>This is a great product and color for those with dark-blonde/mousey-brown hair that want to go back to their childhood blonde color.</li>
      <li>I love L&#x27;oreal Dream Blonde!</li>
      <li>Unfortunately no stores seem to sell this anymore</li>
      <li>more white blond.</li>
      <li>When I first started using it there was no problem.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that I found a reseller that had a stockpile of this product to purchase from, and at half the price I used to pay for it in the store.</li>
      <li>and I certainly can&#x27;t figure out why.</li>
      <li>Great if you like a little bit of sunshine in your blonde--not&lt;br /&gt;brassy or red</li>
      <li>really intrigued me..</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
      <li>I really like this Loreal color for my hair.  </li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal rep was very helpful.</li>
      <li>and I can tell you, it really is a dream.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read here that some gals use just root touch-up and never do the whole head.</li>
      <li>Ordered through Amazon as my local stores stopped carrying it - it wasn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
      <li>But it does have the green top and is called Everstrong, which sounds restorative in its description: no salts, sulfate free, no parabens, natural botanicals and 100% vegan.</li>

      <li>I having been coloring my own hair for several years using different brands.  </li>
      <li>The gray roots, or rather the white roots, were barely colored.&lt;br /&gt;I called L&#x27;Oreal, looking to see if perhaps keeping the coloring solution on longer would color better.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m a natural light blonde to begin with.</li>
      <li>Light Natural Blonde.</li>
      <li>This sounded like a nice package: pre-color protector, the usual 2-part coloring solution (a lot of it) AND, a whole tube of both shampoo and conditioner, PLUS a small tube of after-shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal Preference for more years than I&#x27;d like to admit.</li>
      <li>whole treatment left my hair nice and soft, not distressed, but also not very well colored.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>My natural hair color is a very drab \\&quot;dishwater\\&quot; color.  </li>
      <li>also bought the shampoo with the green top.</li>
      <li>also bought the shampoo with the green top.</li>
      <li>I used this LT ash blond to cover and add blond to the new gray hair.  </li>
      <li>With such a light color, # 9, I could see myself possibly doing this...</li>
      <li>(my natural colour was a very natural golden blonde)..</li>
      <li>I just now finished my first time experience w/ Dream Blonde using #9 Moonbeam Shine.  </li>
      <li>It did a nice job blending  colors together and less brass tone than other brands.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like professional color ..</li>
      <li>Supposed to make hair soft, but manageable, and stylable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am naturally blonde, but as i got older, the color darkened a bit.</li>
      <li>Boxes do not typically have gloves.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone trying to dye their hair blonde at home!&lt;br /</li>
      <li>I even have natural blonde hair to begin with.</li>
      <li>My natural hair color is medium-dark blonde.  </li>
      <li>w/ natural low and highlights..</li>
      <li>My natural color is medium ash blonde, I&#x27;ve been using Loreal Natural Color  #10 ash blonde for a while.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is splitting off Higher than it when I did when I used my old standby 8G at the roots and pulled it through for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <li> I used this LT ash blond to cover and add blond to the new gray hair.  Unlike before when I wished to lighten my Med golden blond hair.  It did a nice job blending  colors together and less brass tone than other brands. will try it once again. I would like it to look less gray ... more white blond.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of my younger days color..I still have some left but now&lt;br /&gt;I can get my entire head/hair the same. Really nice feel too and doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;dry your hair out. Great if you like a little bit of sunshine in your blonde--not&lt;br /&gt;brassy or red but like you&#x27;ve been out in the sun all day! UPDATE recently purchased from BEAUTY TIME not only did the item not reach me (which in all fairness &#x27;could&#x27; have been a post office isdue as ut was refused at the USPS office..why, I have no idea...poor packing is what I was told when I called the PO office) but...when I contacted BEAUTY TIME via email they promised to send again....that was two weeks ago and I have yet to get my hair color but they sure took my money....needless to say I will not purchase from them again!</li>
    <li> IT WORKS!!!!! And that sets it apart from the others.  Ordered through Amazon as my local stores stopped carrying it - it wasn&#x27;t cheap.  Amazon had it for half the price of the local store.  Blondes do have more fun.  Well, mentally anyway.</li>
    <li> My natural color is medium ash blonde, I&#x27;ve been using Loreal Natural Color  #10 ash blonde for a while. I wanted to go lighter and I used this color #9 Moonbeam Shine. It turned out lighter but the color came out very bright yellowish orange, I did not like it.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a great blonde color. The Loreal Dream Blonde Moonbeam Shine gives me a great natural color. I have not been able to find this series in any store. The price is great.</li>
    <li> I just now finished my first time experience w/ Dream Blonde using #9 Moonbeam Shine.  I have used Loreal Couleur Experte w/ highlighting kit for years.. usually 8.3-9.2  I have even mixed these colours together and once got a great outcome.. but lately it seems to always be too brassy and reddish.  My last color was from a professional which was way too yellow.. but I endured the 2 months until serious roots showed... (my natural colour was a very natural golden blonde).. So I purchased this #9 and walla!  I am truly happy with the colour!! I was so sick of the highlighting kit included with the other Loreal product and this one really intrigued me.. The same conditioner is in this kit.. but it also comes w/ a great shine creme that I love... All in all.. i am so very pleased with the turnout.. and it is so much better than my last professional job I can&#x27;t tell you! I give this product 5 stars for ease of use.. good products, easy to read directions, and NO brassyness or reddy color nor purple tints. It&#x27;s the color i&#x27;ve been looking for oh, and also it didn&#x27;t give just one solid color but gave a nice color range  w/ natural low and highlights.. Please Loreal, don&#x27;t discontinue- i&#x27;ve met my match! (one tip, don&#x27;t shampoo- simply rinse the color, condition, rinse w/ cold water, then add the shine creme and style-you&#x27;re done!)Simply put, i highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s well worth the money!( ps ladies -don&#x27;t forget about your Ulta coupons!)</li>
    <li> My hair was light to start with, I wanted it lighter.  This product did nothing to accomplish this.  Product does not work as company says.  Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I love L&#x27;oreal Dream Blonde! I wish they would bring it back. It makes my dark brown hair a shiny blonde.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. I favor Loreal hair coloring products to begin with, but for some reason, my hair did not take this color at all. In all honesty, it doesn&#x27;t look like I even colored my hair.  My roots look a bit dark or the same prior to coloring and I&#x27;m a natural light blonde to begin with. I left it on for 30 mins as indicated. So, I&#x27;m not sure what happened. I noticed that smell of the coloring was a bit stronger than usual too. Hmmm. Will I use this product again? Probably not.</li>
    <li> This product is very good.  The color is warm and rich.  It cannot be purchased in the stores and I much prefer this to any other product out there.</li>
    <li> I have never felt compelled to write a review before, but I am so pleased with the results of this product I just felt I needed to share my experience.  I having been coloring my own hair for several years using different brands.  My natural hair color is medium-dark blonde.  Some of my previous at home colorings left my hair with a reddish tint, so I ended up having to use a toner afterwards.  The Loreal Dream Blonde Color System #9 gave me the results I wanted.  The picture on the box is exacty what I got and I really love it.  The set came with a leave in pre treatment conditioner for your ends, shampoo and conditioner.  It is very reasonably priced and I will be ordering 2-3 more so I will always have the product I need!  It makes me so happy to know that I can get the exact color that I want without having to go to a professional AND thinking about how much money I saved by doing my color myself at home.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past few years.  My natural hair color is a very drab \\&quot;dishwater\\&quot; color.  I really like this Loreal color for my hair.  I color the roots about every 6-8 weeks.  I don&#x27;t have much trouble with dry and/or damaged hair.  I like the shampoo and conditioner that is included to use once a week.  The only thing I do not like is the product is a little hard to find.  When I first started using it there was no problem.  Now, sometimes it is available and sometimes it is not.  I buy a few at a time to have on hand.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  A little more work, but great results.  Boxes do not typically have gloves.  Take a little time to use it.  Certainly worth the money</li>
    <li> This stuff is really great great great. Don&#x27;t think you can buy this in stores.  It&#x27;s like professional color ..angel hair</li>
    <li> This is by far the best at-home blonde haircolor you can buy. Usually when I dye my hair, even with other L&#x27;Oreal hair dyes, my hair turns out brassy and off-color. I even have natural blonde hair to begin with. But I&#x27;ve used Dream Blonde a few times now and I can tell you, it really is a dream. I&#x27;m always left with a beautiful light blonde shade and glossy, soft hair. I highly recommend it. Unfortunately no stores seem to sell this anymore and Amazon is the only place I can find it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and color for those with dark-blonde/mousey-brown hair that want to go back to their childhood blonde color. The color is better than all of the professional weaves that I had over 25 years -- really! It&#x27;s ashame that Loreal discontinued this product!!! I&#x27;m thrilled that I found a reseller that had a stockpile of this product to purchase from, and at half the price I used to pay for it in the store. I&#x27;m not looking forward to the time when I run out and have to find a replacement product.</li>
    <li> I really love this color it alway&#x27;s turn&#x27;s out the&lt;br /&gt;same everytime.It is a beautiful color.Please don&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;stop saleing it i can&#x27;t get it in the store&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Katy Ingle-Harman</li>
    <li> Just the right color with no brass or ash.</li>
    <li> This sounded like a nice package: pre-color protector, the usual 2-part coloring solution (a lot of it) AND, a whole tube of both shampoo and conditioner, PLUS a small tube of after-shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal Preference for more years than I&#x27;d like to admit. But I can&#x27;t grow my hair long using blonde coloring because the ends get very dry. The conditioner which comes with the regular Preference makes my hair limp, so I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This whole treatment left my hair nice and soft, not distressed, but also not very well colored. The gray roots, or rather the white roots, were barely colored.&lt;br /&gt;I called L&#x27;Oreal, looking to see if perhaps keeping the coloring solution on longer would color better. Instead I was told that the product had been discontinued in 2011. What???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color number here is 9, Light Natural Blonde. I&#x27;ve been using 8G, Light Golden Blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The L&#x27;Oreal rep was very helpful. Told me that G with a number means golden, that if I didn&#x27;t like the bit of brassiness I&#x27;d been getting to simply use the plain # 8. Or, of course if I like the color on this box, use plain # 9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preference comes only with the post-coloring conditioner (which I don&#x27;t like).&lt;br /&gt;Excellence comes with the pre-treatment protector, so that you can cover already colored hair and just aim for the roots...something which I have trouble with. I seem to color everything all the time, making my hair like straw at the ends which I usually cut off. I want to grow it longer and needed an answer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She told me about Everpure, both shampoo and conditioner which would work more like the post-treament shine which was in this box. Supposed to make hair soft, but manageable, and stylable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, of course I asked about root touch-up, and she recomended L&#x27;Oreal Rescue, color # 9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read here that some gals use just root touch-up and never do the whole head. With such a light color, # 9, I could see myself possibly doing this...great idea, no?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline: Nice ingredients, but no longer being made as a complete system. Each part, however, can be purchased separately, supposedly with the same result. I liked my hair texture after coloring, and will try some of the rep&#x27;s recommendations. But it won&#x27;t be a while since I just colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important Addendum June 29,2013:&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is splitting off Higher than it when I did when I used my old standby 8G at the roots and pulled it through for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that # 9 color is too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to my usual 8G, trying Excellence this time since it has the pre-treatment in it. A friend uses 8G Excellence with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the shampoo with the green top. It is NOT Everpure as the L&#x27;Oreal rep suggested. But it does have the green top and is called Everstrong, which sounds restorative in its description: no salts, sulfate free, no parabens, natural botanicals and 100% vegan. Vegan is the most appealing, not. It sounds like food. LOLa light color, # 9, I could see myself possibly doing this...great idea, no?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline: Nice ingredients, but no longer being made as a complete system.

    <li> But they have been discontinued. I will switch now to the L&#x27;Oreal I can buy at Wal-Mart. I will miss the shampoo and conditioners that come with these.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments for my hair color..it&#x27;s such a disappointment that they discontinued this!  Seriously I had to buy 10 boxes in order to make sure my hair was the perfect blonde shade for my wedding (which was a year away lol).  I will be sad the day I run out of this color :(</li>
    <li> I have never felt compelled to write a review on a product before using this one! I have been colouring my hair for over 6 years. I wanted to go from (faded) black to blonde, I used 3 other brands, none of them gave me the results I wanted, they all lightened my hair but left a brassy colour, I just dyed my hair last night with this product and it is wonderful! It still isn&#x27;t the blonde I want, but it definitely lightened it A LOT and took out all of the brassiness! With one more application I know that I am going to get the results I have been looking for!&lt;br /&gt;The product also comes with before treatment, shampoo and conditioner (which work great) and some after shine, which smells good and my hair is super soft and healthy looking after using everything that came in that box! I highly recommend this product to anyone trying to dye their hair blonde at home!&lt;br /&gt; The price is also quite reasonable, I am going to buy a couple more boxes just to have on hand because it is so great! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;-Hope this review helped.</li>
    <li> I am naturally blonde, but as i got older, the color darkened a bit. Ive always looked for a nice, light blonde that would look good with my complexion, and this color on the box looked perfect. However my hair did not take to the dye... only my roots did. I am  not sure if it is the product itself, or my hair that is a problem. &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I love this hair color line. The only place I can find it is here on Amazon.  Loreal discontinued it and I certainly can&#x27;t figure out why. I went through a lot of brands &amp; colors and none equaled The Dream Blonde Color system.</li>
