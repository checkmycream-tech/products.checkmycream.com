<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When I got it, I thought it was going to taste like yucky...I really like this juice.  Something I will continue to take.</li>
    <li> it seems to help my hair and nails grow, but even though it said it was in stock it took over a month to get it. Not sure if I want to order again.</li>
    <li> I live in the desert &amp; my nails were impossible to grow.  Now I have to clip them they get so long. My hair feels better, my skin is healthy - I use the oil on my face also, it seems to be a cure-all for everything. With all the good its doing on the outside, it must be doing amazing things on the inside. I would buy this stuff by gallons if I could.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this supplement for 3 weeks and can see the results on my skin, it&#x27;s delicious too!</li>
    <li> This product is not intended for loosing weight, its to keep you on the same wight regardles of what you eat. It works! I haven&#x27;t got any problems with shipping.</li>
    <li> Saw Dr. Oz talk about the benefits of using this product on his show.  As usual, he is correct.  I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  It does taste very good, almost like orange juice and other tropical fruits mixed.  Have not seen the other benefit of weight loss that he talked about with this product, but my energy has improved and I&#x27;m sleeping better, too!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after a recommendation. I just ordered more. I mix the liquid with water, ice, and drink it like that or blended to a smoothie. I also make a more traditional smoothie by adding whatever fruit I have on hand and some yogurt. I like the idea of a more natural way to get my omegas and vitamins. I have not yet noticed the beauty improvements advertised, but I have not been on it very long, and that is not the reason I decided to try it.</li>
    <li> This liquid supplement is really tart, however, I do love the taste.  It has improved my hair and nails in less than a month.  My body must have been lacking these supplements.</li>
    <li> I received this product in a timely manner. Product was packaged to prevent damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste is nice. This is my second bottle so I think I need more time to determine if there are any changes to hair, skin, nails.</li>
    <li> i found this supplement to be beneficial as far as skin, hair and nail nourishment. However, I was looking more for its benefits as a weight loss aid, as per endorsement by Dr. Oz. I did not experience the same weight loss benefits as described by those who commented in an article in First magazine, where Dr. Oz was also quoted. this, in spite of watching my diet carefully, and increasing exercise.</li>
    <li> It had a nice apricot type flavor. I drank a couple ounces every morning.I didnt notice that it did anything with weight. I did notice that my skin seemed brighter! I like the taste and the supplemental health benefits, but the cost will prevent me from purchasing any on a regular basis. If I have the opportunity to spend the money, I may purchase it again. I have yet to try any skin care items.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like the test of this. I wish I bought something else!</li>
    <li> I love the taste. One bottle did not last long. I need to measure instead of free pouring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a week of use and I have had to reorder. My skin and eyes look clear. I continue to have circles under my eyes. I don&#x27;t think there are any miracles in this, but it helps along with lots of other tonics and potions to keep me looking okay.</li>
    <li> This is added to agave syrup and club soda for a refreshing drink with lots of antioxidants. I can easily substitute this for a soda or other high calorie drink and be fully satisfied. It is supposed to be anti-inflammatory as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product twice in the last 6 weeks. Suddenly, the price has increased almost $10 as of 10-2-13! I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This is the best sea buck thorn as far as taste.  But for price and time it took to get not gonna happen again.  Will stick with another.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff!!!!  Tastes great and really makes your skin look great. You only need a shot serving a day...and you will see the difference.  Omega 7 is hard to obtain but this juice is packed with it.  Its a little expensive for two people everyday...but worth it.</li>
    <li> Very good product Dr Oz and Dr Weil recommend it</li>
    <li> Don not like the taste but does work great!</li>
    <li> Only been taking it for about 4 days but think there is a difference going on here.  I am ordering more even though it is way expensive in my opinion, but it does the job!</li>
    <li> Juice is fine on its own, but tastes great mixed with a little Oj. Will purchase again, it cleans your insides well.</li>
    <li> Better to spend $ on liquid collagen and taking green&#x27;s, and other alternative sources less expensive.</li>
    <li> Was a little hesitant about buying this because of the bad reviews about taste however the taste is really delicious and I&#x27;m already starting to notice I feel better and my skin and hair have improved.&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product and ill be definitely buying more.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle, but some how is bottle taste different from the first two.. It&#x27;s taste bitter.. I have however gotten use to the taste. I&#x27;m starting to see some improvement in my skin.. It&#x27;s brighter and much softer. I also take the capsules and some of the facial products.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!  The taste is GREAT and is very easy to take!  The bottle is a bit small considering you need to take 3 mls a day, but am def ordering more and will be a regular part of our diet.  The benefits of this product are exceptional!</li>
    <li> Sea Buckthorn is the best antioxidant on the planet. It gives me so much energy. I can not drink this supplement at night. Because I would be up all night. Great study aid to be up naturally for school. Great recipe 1oz sea buckthorn, 1oz agave nector mix together. Pour over tall glass of ice then add Pellegrino mineral water. The Best delicious.</li>
    <li> After using it for short period of time  noticed that my nails and hair looked better. I had to order more for friends and family that noticed the difference. The price is great, compare to where it is loacally available - half price-!! It lasts and you get used to the taste quick; at least I did!!</li>
    <li> As a woman of a certain age, this product is a must have!  I have been taking Omega-7 for a couple of years now to combat dryness in my hair, skin and mouth.  It is a wonderful supplement that I cannot love without.  This form is an easy to take supplement, shipping was fast, and the price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> i have been taking this supplement for a month. purchased at a vitamin shoppe. purchasing through amazon faster and cheaper</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading an article in First for Women magazine by Dr. Oz for weight loss. I read reviews before buying it and saw that it helped people with their nails so I bought it more for the nails than weight loss.  It hasn&#x27;t help with the weight loss but it doing a great job for my nails.  I have been using this for about 3 weeks.  My nails are no longer peeling and the are starting to feel stronger.  I have use many nail products and some vitamins but nothing seemed to work until I tried Sea buckthorn liquid. I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I have used the sea buckthorn for almost a month and have not seen an improvement in my skin, hair or nails. I am very disappointed with the results of this product.</li>
    <li> This product really does what it says, it revitalizes and renews your hair, skin and nails.  I noticed a thickening of my hair, lessening of age spots and wrinkles in my skin, my skin not tearing so easily when working outside in the yard without gloves, lessening of the dark circles under my eyes, and lessening of the ridges in my nails within 2 weeks.  I took the full 3 oz. per day, the bottle says 1-3 oz. per day, the taste is tart, but still tasty.  It has also helped with internal mucus membranes like my stomach and throat, I used to get dry and have to sip water all the time and now that is gone.  I used to get an acid stomach if I didn&#x27;t eat every 4 hrs. and that is gone now also.  I&#x27;m definitely going to get more of this liquid when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff , my hair grew faster.</li>
    <li> I think this could be a good supplant. I&#x27;ll need to use it longer to fine out. Little spendy..But I want to give it a chance.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like life blood! Entering fall and winter, it keeps me glowing! I need a bottle a month to make sure my skin is healthy...</li>
    <li> This Sibu drink is delicious! Much better tasting than any other Sea Buckthorn liquids I have tasted. Does not have the strong bitter taste that others have. Purchased this product through Amazon.com with a free shipping option which is one of the reasons I made this particular purchase here.  This product is a lot more reasonably priced on Amaz.com as well, much better than the in store retailers. Quick on the shipping too!</li>
    <li> This product is great, but the flavor is unique, not bad just different from anything I have tried. One serving does give me all of my Omegas in just an ounce. The price was also great and i got it cheaper than i could anywhere else. The product was also a prime eligible item so i got it delivered with free two day shipping. All in all it was a win.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Nails improved; skin improved. Can&#x27;t complain here. I bad tasting either. I like this product. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is good for me. It has helped my hair, nails, skin and even my energy. I have ordered it more than once so yes I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I live in the desert. The air is very dry, and biologically I have dry skin and hair. This product nourishes from the inside out with just a shot a day. My skin glows, and I have noticed hair growth, on my head. My hair is shinier and I am very pleased with the results of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you reach the age of 40, we health conscience women know we have to take extra care of what we have. I feel like I have found a natural magical gem. Its a must have for the moisture compromised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix with your favorite juice or drink it as a shot to start you day. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> 3 words ... The best ever.</li>
    <li> This tastes ok, I just didn&#x27;t see any noticeable results from it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been drinking 1 oz. a day for about 6 weeks (2 bottles) and while I really wish I could say wow!, I can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Changed my life. Gave me amazing energy.  Had to cut my nails twice a week. Great as a vitamin as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff tasted good and I noticed my hair and nails grew faster than normal. However, I was still low in fatty acids and this bottle didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> This is more beneficial than vitamins.  Provides great energy. T have used this for a long time to battle fatigue</li>
    <li> Particularly liked the fact the expiration date on the bottles is December 2015.  Have used this product for several years.  It was perfect.  Will order from you again.</li>
    <li> I plan to keep using this product. it tastes best when chilled in the fridge and is a good vitamin supplement. I can see improvement in my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product..... can&#x27;t imagine not having it.  I saw results very quickly, radiant, healthy glow to my skin, my hair and nails started to grow like weeds. I highly recommend this product. Thank you Sibu.  Take a chance try it. I just know you will love it!</li>
    <li> I just finished my 1st bottle and I do not see any difference yet. I started a second bottle......... Hoping it works. Will see.........</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t cheap, but I&#x27;ve noticed a difference not just in how my skin/hair/nails look--but how my body feels too.  I like to mix it into some watered down orange juice, gives a nice taste mixture... but I can also swig down a serving on its own if needed and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad.&lt;br /&gt;If I get lazy and skip it for a few days to a week, I notice I&#x27;m more tired and heavy feeling, like bricks are on me.  When I take a serving a day, I feel happier, lighter, more &amp;#34;put together&amp;#34; mentally, and my skin stays clearer.</li>
    <li> Discovered this at my local health store trying to improve the quality of dry hair, nails etc. loved the taste and noticed a difference in nails but not the hair..... Then I see it on dr. Oz with Andrew Weil, my favorite MD, so will keep going since I can&#x27;t get the fish oil pills swallowed. Who knows ....</li>
    <li> Items were exactly as ordered and they arrived promptly. Taste is really great but have not seen any results yet now on 4th bottle. Will give it a little more time.</li>
    <li> I think it tast pretty gross but after awhile you begin to get accostum to the taste. I take 1/3 cup a day for a month and have seen a significant improvement in my skin and hair growth. I would suggest the product and I&#x27;d also suggest you get 2-3 bottles like I mentiond I took 1/3 cup a day and it was gone within four weeks so save your self a little time ordering and just get 2 or 3 bottles at once</li>
    <li> This product is diluted with other juices, really takes away from the impact that the seabuck thorn should have.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> This tastes great, like apricot nectar, but I was dismayed to discover all the non-sea buckthorn ingredients; I don&#x27;t want to pay $1 an ounce for apple juice and cane sweetener (that&#x27;s just sugar!).  I&#x27;ve been taking it for a week and haven&#x27;t seen any change in my skin.  I&#x27;ve gained 2 pounds, but that might be the parties...</li>
    <li> This Sea Buckthorn tastes good.  I&#x27;ve had another brand that was pretty bitter.  This one is not.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I had read that this was a great supplement for my body so I decided to give it a try, the the taste is a little different, but, ok, the way i view it is, if the benefit outweighs the difference in a palatable expierience, then I will go forward, and still try again, to see if this really does work.</li>
    <li> it is ok I guess because I did not see any changes in my skin or anything else.  I have been taking this for 2 months and I am giving up on it</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost 3 years. My hair nails and skin has never looked better. My hair is in the middle of my back and I receive compliments all the time on how healthy it looks. I have three of my friends that are now using this; one for almost a year. I live by the supplement.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat buyer!  makes your skin quite soft!</li>
    <li> good for skin, nails and hair</li>
    <li> I liked the taste and even felt more energy.  As far as renewing my skin, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> I honestly think Sea Buckthorn is mainly for hair, nails and skin.  I did not see any weight loss, but I did notice improvement in my skin.  The taste is much better than other brands, which taste icky and bitter.  But this one is less concentrated so it tastes more like fruit juice.</li>
    <li> I started taking Sea Buckthorn 4 weeks ago for the extra omegas. Since that time, I have noticed that the skin on my arms is changing. I use to have lots of liver spots (age spots) that would dry out and flake off. Those spots are now gone!! Many of the spots have faded and are disappearing. My skin has become really soft also.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I have been using for a month now and have not really seen any changes. Taste is okay too. Not that delicious.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking 1.5 oz. of this a day for 60 days. As my second bottle began running low, I wasn&#x27;t noticing much of a difference. I belong to a weight loss group and have been at a plateau for 1 year. I&#x27;ve been off track lately with my eating, however, when I went to weigh in Wednesday, I was 2.5 pounds UNDER my goal weight. I have not been an angel with my diet, so it has to be that the sea buckthorn just took close to the 60 days to kick in. Just two days later, I&#x27;m down another pound! Thinking of switching to the gel capsules for portability, but this supplement is here to stay!!</li>
    <li> It worked really well in terms of my finger nails. I had box braids so in terms for hair Im unclear but I like the taste. Just mix it with orange juice.</li>
    <li> I like the taste of the liquid and I feel a difference in my overall wellbeing . It&#x27;s hard to describe but I know  I can tolerate thiigs I couldn&#x27;t before.    The only complaint is I had to contact the dealer  to see when the product would arrive as it took longer than  was originally stated.    I am going to order more today.</li>
    <li> It taste great, but I finished two bottles and still feel the same as when I started. Maybe you have to buy more to see and feel a change.</li>
    <li> Made my feet, ankles, and legs swell up. Then brought on gout in bottom of feet. Got nothing good from it, only more pain and suffering.</li>
    <li> Product taste great and arrived very quickly. Nice size bottle.  After 2 weeks not sure if I see a difference yet in my skin or hair but will be ordering again to give it more time.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me. Not really sure what else to say about this. Lots of hype about it but not sure why.</li>
    <li> I have no idea if it really works, it sure does taste good and I am 51.</li>
    <li> I like it ok, but it could have a better taste.  Supposed to taste like orange juice.  It is just a little bit bitter.  I noticed that I have lost a little weight with this product.  It helps regulate me.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am very surprise, because only 3 weeks and already seeing results. My skin has glow and my hair seems healthier per my sister and husband.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness this stuff is the stuff combined with other sibu products my skin was pretty cocoa brown and healthy recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I did get the product very fast but I don&#x27;t plan on purchasing any more it is a little to expense.</li>
    <li> I have been taking Sibu  a week and I have started to see the difference I my skin. I have had chemo  in the past and my skin became dry .</li>
    <li> I order sea buckthorn juice about a week ago used as soon as received the bottle I I like the way it taste I like sour flavor, i&#x27;m not sure if it dose what it came but I felt better and it control my appetite i&#x27;m not it as hunger . i&#x27;m going to order another bottle</li>
    <li> This item came late for me (2 days after was promissed) and already I was not in USA. I hope someone will enjoy it. For me it was too late.</li>
    <li> I realized too late that I&#x27;d have to commit to this product for a very long time to see any real difference in my skin, hair or nails, and it&#x27;s too costly to do that since as suggested, you&#x27;ll have to order a new product every two weeks.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s highly drinkable but you have to be willing to commit to this long term to see results, if any.</li>
    <li> Acquired taste! Make sure you mix it with your favorite juice or drink.</li>
    <li> By recommendation of our Physician, my husband has been using this product for over 3 years. Because of the cost, we decided to take a break to see if we would notice a difference. Within a couple months of not taking it, my husbands hair began to noticeably thin and a bald spot appeared.  WOW! What a difference! I would highly recommend it to anyone with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff does wonders for skin and thick long eye lashes.</li>
    <li> One of these bottles only lasted me less than a couple of weeks and I was afraid most of the potency had diminished by the time I was drinking it but after reading other reviews I&#x27;m going to give it another shot (no pun intended!) I ordered a second bottle after I finished the first one and the taste and texture was different from the first bottle so that was it for me! However, while reviewing it myself, I re-read the other reviews an ordered another one just now. I haven&#x27;t drank the Sibu for about 3-4 weeks but I must say I did notice I was losing less hair (than what is even normal I mean, my hair is pretty thick already) about 1/2 way into the second bottle. Even still, I poured the rest out because it tasted strange.&lt;br /&gt;I also started taking 15mg of zinc per day before a cosmetic procedure about the same time I started on the first bottle of Sibu which was just before Christmas 2013. I am now noticing LOTS of short hairs sticking all out of my shoulder length hair near my scalp and my hair feels thicker near my scalp and I mean quite a bit thicker! So I&#x27;m going to try some more! I&#x27;m still taking the zinc too though.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of SIBU products bit this one I will not purchase again.  I was really hoping to see if it really did help with weight loss but I cannot get past the taste.  It is terrible.  I gagged trying to get it down.  It is very gritty and thick.</li>
    <li> Did not get to use it.  I had the item some time before I opened it only to find the seal had been broken.  Expensive item I had to toss.</li>
    <li> This one is better than the concentrated one. It tastes better and does not gloop up after a few weeks. I still add it to juice and I feel a burst of energy. (My mother in law, after a week still didn&#x27;t feel anything...) My head feels clearer, I am sleeping better, and I am not craving food as much. I like it because it helps my nails and head, but if I lose some weight, than great!! I hope it works for you.</li>
    <li> Great product!  My hair and nails are the best they have ever been!  It tastes kind of citrusy.  I like it and recommend giving it a try.  Must use it for several months to see results.</li>
    <li> makes the fat disappear!  Love the stuff. Use it and you will not be looking back. I\\&quot;ve shed 20 pounds!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before making the purchase. I have been drinking this for three weeks. I am seeing a difference in my skin, but not sure if it is totally because of this one product. I think my face looks a little  brighter.  I am also taking one Sibu tablet daily and I am using the oil on my face in the a.m. and p.m. As for weight loss, nothing yet. May be to soon to say. I didn&#x27;t buy this product for that purpose. I&#x27;ll see in Oct. when I have my blood work done.</li>
    <li> Considering all the supposed health benefits this was supposed to have, I really don&#x27;t think it is anything special.  Certainly not worth the price.  Used it faithfully every day and saw NO benefits at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It was OK.  Didn&#x27;t notice any improvements in the week I was taking it.  (Who would, right,lol). It just tastes awful.  Tart and kind of bitter, like a carrot juice.  I decided to take a pill instead.  Cost-wise, pills were the better deal.  Plus, this doesn&#x27;t travel well.  Had to go without on a cpl trips.  Either had to take entire bottle or take a small Tupperware container, like for mustard/sauces.</li>
    <li> MY SKIN FEELS LIKE A ROSE PETAL,SINCE I BEEN TAKIING THIS WONDERFUL SEA BUCKHORN JUICE SUPPLE AND I MEAN SUPPIEMENT.</li>
    <li> great product taste great I drink it twice a day everyday. I noticed great improvement on my nails , and hair.</li>
    <li> Threw it out!!!  Ugh! Oops need to make up 11 words:  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!</li>
    <li> I suppose it&#x27;s good.  Didn&#x27;t observe a change in overall complexion, hair, or nails. It won&#x27;t hurt to try it</li>
    <li> Ive been taken this stuff for a little while my hair looks good my skin looks great, I look and feel amazing (it might just be all the healthy food I eat)</li>
    <li> Sea Buckthorn liquid Juice was very good. It cost. But it works. aI will not be able to get it anymore. I have given up all flour and sugar.</li>
    <li> I hear other Sea Buckthorn drinks taste awful. This one is like a mix of apple, carrot, and orange juice - tasty. After drinking 3 shots of this daily for a few months, I didn&#x27;t see any improvements to my skin (I have KP). Also it does have other fruits mixed in, so you&#x27;re not getting a strong sea buckthorn intake with this.</li>
    <li> My hair, nails, and skin all react great to this supplement.  After taking it for about 3 months all the scars on my body started to disappear.  I now have been taking it almost everyday for over a year and I have not scars left at all.  Was definitely not expecting that, but it was worth the money just for that alone.I notice huge differences in skin tone when I stop taking it.  I only take 30ml a day.  I don&#x27;t feel like I need more than that to get the result I want.  Also - My eye lashes have doubled in length and thickness from this too.  Nice bonus.  I swear by this stuff.  I have tried the pills and other brands, but they have done nothing for me.  I will continue to take this supplement until I throw in the towel and let age get the best of me.  :^)</li>
    <li> For the size and price, I just expected more.It did help kill my appetite, but I had to take 3 X&#x27;s more than the recommended dosage.</li>
    <li> I really like this product but am trying a few different brands to see if one is better than this. I do find this liquid better than the capsules I tried. So far this is my favorite version of sea buckthorn, and since I plan on using this daily, want to feel confident I&#x27;m using the best and most affordable version out there.</li>
    <li> I actually first discovered this at a bar  in a martini if you can believe it!  It is tasty,healthy and not too sweet at all....straight up that is!</li>
    <li> I loved this drink.  Even my kids loved it. Sweet and tart.  Noticing lots of new hair growth, and stronger nails.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this, it&#x27;s a must... I was taking the pill form until I ran across this on the Internet, I was hesitant to try it but now that I have I will continue to use it. I will still keep taking the capsules because you can carry them with you in your purse for convenience. Sibu has a really good taste, and you only take one ounce two to three times a day.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this !</li>
    <li> First of all delivery was quick and well packaged.  The product itself does wonders for my skin, hair and nails, I don&#x27;t notice weight loss, but I don&#x27;t gain weight.  (I keep no diet) I would highly recommend especially for women over 40 with thinning hair, brittle nails and lack of luster to skin!</li>
    <li> Only been taking it for about a month now...haven&#x27;t really given it a chance to see if its doing its purpose yet...but I love the taste, taste like orange juice</li>
