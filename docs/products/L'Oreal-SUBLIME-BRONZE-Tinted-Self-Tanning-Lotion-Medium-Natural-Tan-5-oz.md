      <li>This product has always worked great for me.</li>
      <li>Until now while I wait for it to come in lol.</li>
      <li>the results are great.</li>
      <li>and I think you&#x27;ll be happy with the results.</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s reasonably pleasant</li>
      <li>and my palms were a bright orange</li>
      <li>I have fair skin</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nivea Sun-Kissed Radiance Fair to Medium</li>
      <li>Good color&lt;br</li>
      <li>I always have good color underneath the bronzer</li>
      <li>I have a medium fair skin tone.</li>
      <li>IMO it was a good find.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good to use during the summer when you have a tan already and helps even out my freckles.</li>
      <li>I am actually fair skinned but find that if I apply it infrequently it lasts a couple of weeks and gives a nice glow to my chicken-white legs.  </li>
      <li>I will start off by saying I am extremely fair skinned, and found this went on easily, doesn&#x27;t seem to be streaky (the bronzer helps with making the application even), and it smells very nice after developing.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Great product doesn&#x27;t leave orange skin tones and goes on smooth</li>
      <li>Chairs, clothes, sheets, my couch, and heaven forbid it&#x27;s warm out</li>
      <li>The color and shimmer effects from using this product is nice.</li>
      <li>I like the kind of glow this tanner gives, and yes, it&#x27;s wonderful that it&#x27;s tinted so you can actually see where you are putting the cream so you don&#x27;t miss spots, but I do find this tanning lotion to be a bit overpowering in the smell department.</li>
      <li>Love this, goes on easy, smells nice, and wont rub off on clothing at all.</li>
      <li>I have used many many self tanners and since Mystic tan has discontinued their tanning lotion</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>Aside from looking like a zebra, I really do love the color and glitter that this lotion turns to be.  </li>
      <li>YOU WILL get streaks, you will get blotchy, and you will get darker on areas you don&#x27;t moisturize (which I think happens with most tanners).</li>
      <li>Love this self tanner.  </li>
      <li>top of all this, the lotion has vitamin E, so it helps revitalize and nourish your skin.</li>
      <li>That being said, this product is probably in my top 10 favorites.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s the best tanner I have used</li>
      <li>Maybe I should apply it with the backs of my hands! :-)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay,</li>
      <li>LOVE this self-tanner, except for the glitter/shimmer, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
      <li>I have used Famous Dave&#x27;s Moisture Tan and like it</li>
      <li>Hopefully, I&#x27;ll find a better product soon before I&#x27;m overly pasty again.</li>
      <li>This is a safe way to look tanned and even your complexion without risking the danger of a tanning bed.</li>
      <li>conclusion is that this is probably a good product if you use it frequently and get good at applying it.  </li>
      <li>The immediate effect is okay.  </li>
      <li>glad I did this on a Thursday evening because I have three days for it to wear off before work on Monday, but there is an almost-full container of this stuff that is going promptly in the trash can.  </li>
      <li>I also love that I can put lotion on over after 30 mins.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Just make sure an apply it with your favorite lotion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, pretty good product.</li>
      <li>I tan easily when I go into the sun, but I am attempting to stay out of the sun and keep my skin healthy.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing for those trying to not look pasty at their first day on the beach!</li>
      <li>It feels good when applied and dries fast.  </li>
      <li>I used it once and got a very nice glow immediately, and it looks natural.  </li>
      <li>It is also an excellent lotion, &amp; when I&#x27;m using this, I don&#x27;t need to use any other lotion.</li>
      <li>It does glitter, but I don&#x27;t find it very noticeable unless one is in a bright light and looks closely.  </li>
      <li>Comes off  easily with sweat and wetness&lt;</li>
      <li>Easy to get even color</li>
      <li>Comes off easily with sweat and any wetness</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and has no smell.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still hard to get it perfectly applied, but it&#x27;s better than most.</li>
      <li>With 3 applications you should get the effect you want--it streaks a bit on the first couple of applications, no matter how adept you are at putting it on.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and not a problem.</li>
      <li>Extremely light tint.</li>
      <li>It is a &amp;#34;stainer&amp;#34; and will rub off on your lightly colored bath towels if you don&#x27;t shower-and-scrub thoroughly.</li>
      <li>I have a light brown complexion which gets a bit sallow by end of winter.</li>
      <li>Also it has a bronzer which means the bronzer will come off in your shower the first time!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this, especially given the great reviews, but I honestly don&#x27;t see how anyone could give it over three stars.  </li>
      <li>I am fair skinned and still need to order dark to get a nice glow..</li>
      <li>Sublime years ago, it was never that great, but at least good for a quick tan.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The glitter disappears after a day, and the color fades significantly after 2-3 days.</li>
      <li>The best thing about this stuff is if you decide to just tan your legs or etcs it fades in with the lighter part of your body instead of a straight line from dark to light....</li>
      <li>Not a dramatic change, more like a glow.</li>
      <li>Gives me just the right amount of tan!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sticky until it dries, but it does dry quickly and the color is great, and non-streaky if you&#x27;ve prepped your skin and applied correctly.  </li>
      <li>first hour after you apply it, your skin will feel really sticky, but it does so to effectively keep the lotion from staining your clothes.</li>
      <li>To start off this is a VERY deep tanning lotion, I would not recommend to a fair skinned person like myself unless you mix it with another lotion (Which I recommend Hemps Self Gradual Tanning Lotion with the two together</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t really what I would call a &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; it is more like a gel.</li>
      <li>Smells not bad</li>
      <li>Maybe ok if I&#x27;m going out on the town, but for the most part I&#x27;m just throwing on a pair of jeans and off to run errands - so I look like I&#x27;m trying to be all fancy at the grocery store and such.  </li>
      <li>I am very white (I&#x27;m mostly Irish), and if used correctly, this works great!</li>
      <li>I was out and wanted something quick, so I just ran to the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>My best friend also got this, and a few moments ago texted me that she, too, was very streaky.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I admit, the lotion did leave a lovely color, and the streaks eventually faded as I applied more color daily.</li>
      <li>I mix with my regular daily lotion to calm the shimmer and works great for me!</li>
      <li>I double coated this the first time knowing the brown guide would wash off, the result was a natural looking light brown tan, very nice for winter.</li>
      <li>I washed my hands like a madwoman, and a few hours after applying it, I thought it looked great.  </li>
      <li>You come out with a golden glow versus coming out orangey.</li>
      <li>like I got my moneys worth.</li>
      <li>The next morning, wake up and shower, step out of the shower with a nice tan.</li>
      <li>to apply, and keep rubbing and smearing in until all the moisture is absorbed into your skin--this will increase your chances of getting a streak-free application.</li>
      <li>I put it on, and noticed right away that there seemed to be reflective, glittery speckles everywhere.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great product!  I used it once and got a very nice glow immediately, and it looks natural.  It feels good when applied and dries fast.  It goes on easily and has no smell.  Even 6 hours later, there is absolutely no odor, which is uncommon among self-tanning products.  It comes with glitter to make you sparkle, and this was a surprise, as I did not see any reference to this on the container.  It&#x27;s not overly done, though, and I am liking it.  If you don&#x27;t want the glitter, this product is not for you.</li>
    <li> I like this product for the price. It&#x27;s good to use during the summer when you have a tan already and helps even out my freckles. The glitter is a bit too much and makes me feel like a teenager. It&#x27;s a little on the orange side but not as bad as some of the cheap self-tanners. Overall OK. I think I&#x27;ll stick to my other more expensive product-Sun Laboratories.</li>
    <li> Love this, goes on easy, smells nice, and wont rub off on clothing at all. not hard to get even tan. there is glitter mixed in so if your not ok with a little sparkle them this is not for you, however its a fast even easy tan lotion, and i have tried them all!!!!</li>
    <li> This product works beautifully.  I have tried more expensive tanners that were more than twice the price that did not provide the rich color that this does.  The color is even with absolutely no streaks.  It wears off evenly in about 5-7 days.  The color is a nice bronze color for my pale freckly skin tone.  Absolutely no orange tint even if I apply it two days in a row.  It dries quickly with no color transfer to my clothes even though I only wait a few minutes to get dressed.  The only drawback is that is contains these little sparkly specks that some people might not like, but it goes away after your first shower.  Would buy this over the more expensive brands any day.</li>
    <li> I tried this self tanner because the Jergens gradual tanning lotion just did not work for me.  I tan easily when I go into the sun, but I am attempting to stay out of the sun and keep my skin healthy.  This worked on the first application for me and I noticed a subtle difference right away.  Beware, there is glitter in this self-tanner.  I find that it helps in the application but at the same time I hate wearing glitter.  So for me, I only use this in the evening after showering, since I always shower in the morning.  This does not rub off on sheets and with showering in the morning I can get the glitter off and not look like I&#x27;m going out to the club.  Love this self tanner.  Its still a bit expensive for drug-store but it has lasted long enough to where I feel like I got my moneys worth.</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that I can&#x27;t stand being in a tanning bed, and I can&#x27;t take the cost of spray tanning, which led me to try out this product. This stuff is amazing for those trying to not look pasty at their first day on the beach! If you apply a decent amount onto the skin, and rub it in really, really well, it gives you a very deep, brown (not orange!!) skin tone with a shimmer that reflects beautifully in the sun. It doesn&#x27;t splotch or streak, and it won&#x27;t stain your hands if you scrub them really well after application is complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first hour after you apply it, your skin will feel really sticky, but it does so to effectively keep the lotion from staining your clothes. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, and it doesn&#x27;t stink up your clothes. I applied this product, let my skin dry for an hour, and went out on the town in a tight little top. The next day my shirt smelled like my perfume and deodorant, but no sign of the lotion was left behind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern for some people&#x27;s preference of this product, it the shimmer effect. This stuff has got some intense bronzer, which leaves skin very glittery. If you&#x27;d prefer not to look like a Twilight vampire, then you may want to apply the lotion before bed (it won&#x27;t stain your sheets), and shower in the morning (don&#x27;t scrub your body too hard!). I promise the color stays for a few days, but the shimmer is easily washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color of my skin after just one application was amazing!! I&#x27;ve never looked this dark even after a summer of casual sunning. I hardly recognized myself in the mirror the next day, but I sure did look damn good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of all this, the lotion has vitamin E, so it helps revitalize and nourish your skin. I have naturally dry skin, but once this lotion totally dries, my skin feels smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, I&#x27;ll be buying this lotion again once I run out. I mean, you really can&#x27;t beat $8 a bottle over any tanning package at the salon!</li>
    <li> Sucks, definitely not worth 15 $ I used it for a week and orange spots started appearing and my hands were orange for a while this lotion made me looking dirty</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere in stores and found it online here for cheaper!</li>
    <li> Great product I have used this for years! This is a two pack with a free sunscreen unbelievable value!</li>
    <li> The best self tan cream I have tried</li>
    <li> I have a medium fair skin tone. This stuff streaked badly the first time I used it. However, I decided to keep going and hope for the best. I admit, the lotion did leave a lovely color, and the streaks eventually faded as I applied more color daily. Unfortunately, it left severe dark patches under my bicep area and thighs, where my skin is lightest. I have had to wait for this stuff to wash off, because I&#x27;m tired of looking like a leper. That&#x27;s another thing: don&#x27;t expect the color to last very long. I could almost watch it wash away each time I took a shower. The glitter disappears after a day, and the color fades significantly after 2-3 days. It gets three stars for the color, because that has been hard for me to find. But I&#x27;m moving on to my next sunless tanner...</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I am very white (I&#x27;m mostly Irish), and if used correctly, this works great! I wasn&#x27;t going for a super dark tan, just a little color. I apply this after I shower and shave my legs. I always mixed it with my favorite lotion (about 50/50 to tone down the orange-ish effect), and it really works nicely and blends well. I don&#x27;t shower for 48 hours and it lasts about 3+ days then fades away.  I have a shimmery glow to my skin that doesn&#x27;t look fake or orange. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years now. I&#x27;ll continue to use it. I must note, it does have that sharp smell to it... just like all self-tanners. If you can put up with that, this is the product for you. Just make sure an apply it with your favorite lotion. :)  I would recommend this product! A+</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It gives a nice, natural looking tan with just one use, &amp; easy to maintain a few times a week.  It is also an excellent lotion, &amp; when I&#x27;m using this, I don&#x27;t need to use any other lotion.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s got all the negatives of its predecessors, stinky, streaky, turns you a lovely golden orange. Oh, and it comes off on your clothes.</li>
    <li> This is the easiest self tanner to apply in my opinion so it&#x27;s generally the one I go for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve found with other self tanning lotions is you have to be a master at applying them or you end up with streaks and severe darkening around creases(armpits, knees, etc). Or they come off on everything and I do mean everything. Chairs, clothes, sheets, my couch, and heaven forbid it&#x27;s warm out and you sweat a little...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is so easy to apply but you have to rub it in!!! It&#x27;s not a lotion and there&#x27;s no waiting for it to soak in so it&#x27;s very doable. Just put it on and rub rub rub. If you don&#x27;t want streaks then don&#x27;t create them! Rub rub rub... Usually takes me 15 min. to do my whole body. I have fair skin so I have to be very careful around knees, elbows, feet and hands. What I usually do for example, is rub it in my lower leg and when it&#x27;s almost completely soaked in I&#x27;ll give a (one) sweep around my knee and foot. I always wash my hands between body parts and at the end I&#x27;ll put a little on a paper towel and go over my hand excluding my palm. Comes out perfect each time. There is glitter in it so be warned. I personally don&#x27;t care and even like it somewhat but some people will throw a fit about it. You can just wash off the glitter after 4-5 hours or in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will always prefer self tanner in the spray bottle but those only last a week or two and I&#x27;m out, plus I have no control over knees and elbows and have to use some pretty fancy techniques to get it off those areas without creating lines/streaks. So for now I&#x27;m going with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a smell but I think it&#x27;s reasonably pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t turn funky after a few hours (remember those back in the day?). Also it has a bronzer which means the bronzer will come off in your shower the first time!! I always have good color underneath the bronzer but it&#x27;s lighter. This isn&#x27;t a bad thing. This gives you a chance to build up to a color you want which means it won&#x27;t be patchy when it comes off. Two days in a row is plenty for me. Then just maintain it twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  Good color&lt;br /&gt;  Not lotion-y so it really doesn&#x27;t rub off on anything&lt;br /&gt;  Easy to get even color&lt;br /&gt;  Dries almost immediately&lt;br /&gt;  Smells not bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  Doesn&#x27;t last more than 3-4 days but lets be real, that&#x27;s how all do-it-yourself self-tanners are&lt;br /&gt;  If you sweat it can cause patchy-ness, again, I haven&#x27;t found a self-tanner where this isn&#x27;t a problem&lt;br /&gt;  The bronzer/glitter washing away in the shower is a little sad&lt;br /&gt;  Because it dries so fast it seems to stain nails worse than others</li>
    <li> Extremely light tint. Must use every day if you want a bit of color. (And I do mean just a little bit of color). I no longer tan to protect my skin, so I am fish belly white most of the year. With daily applications of this, in one week I went from fish belly white to flesh colored. Not a dramatic change, more like a glow. The scent is light and not a problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless self tanning lotions over the years. That being said, this product is probably in my top 10 favorites. It&#x27;s not perfect, but for the price it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Nice, natural looking color.&lt;br /&gt;-Goes on smoothly&lt;br /&gt;-Feels sticky at first but does dry quickly which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;-Nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;-Does not seem to rub off on clothing items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Will leave streaks if you are not careful - can often be fixed with a few more uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shimmer in this lotion may be a con for some, for others a pro. I don&#x27;t mind it really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty good product. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Best tanner on the market</li>
    <li> To start off this is a VERY deep tanning lotion, I would not recommend to a fair skinned person like myself unless you mix it with another lotion (Which I recommend Hemps Self Gradual Tanning Lotion with the two together it works like a charm). This isn&#x27;t really what I would call a &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; it is more like a gel. It smells different than other tanning lotions, and it can sometimes get irritating if you aren&#x27;t used to tanning lotion smell, or in this case gel. The tanning bronzer gel comes out quick so be careful, and it is quite dark when you apply. DO NOT APPLY WITH JUST BARE HANDS USE GLOVES. The reason why I say this, is because when I didn&#x27;t use any gloves for the first time, and I just rinsed my hands with soap and water, it didn&#x27;t come off all the way and made my hands a deep brownish orange as well as in between my fingers. (The whole thing in between my fingers still hasn&#x27;t come off and it has already been 2 weeks so I think that says a lot). When just applying this alone with fingers YOU WILL get streaks, you will get blotchy, and you will get darker on areas you don&#x27;t moisturize (which I think happens with most tanners). What I recommend for this product, is using gloves Hemps Self Tanner (the one with the Pot leaf and beige colored lotion) add a small amount with a small amount of this Sublime Tanning Lotion so that it can be even throughout the whole body and not be so harsh. When I didn&#x27;t do this, and just used this &amp;#34;bronzing gel&amp;#34; alone without any gloves, I used WAYYY too much, and I looked like a Oompa Loompa. It took me a hard scrubbing in the shower and a lot of it came off thankfully but not all the way. Please use this product responsibly.</li>
    <li> Product requested did not come</li>
    <li> I read the reviews as I had this on my face LOL. I was a little nervous. I have used many many self tanners and since Mystic tan has discontinued their tanning lotion I was in search of something comparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put two coats of this on my face last night. Glitter - oh yeah but worse than the glitter was the shine it gave my face, my face looked wet. It was bad. There&#x27;s a very perfumey smell. It&#x27;s okay, I would not recommend this to a guy though that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case. I use this at night and double to triple coat it about 2 hours before bed while I&#x27;m just hanging out in my PJ&#x27;s. I glitter and shine and go to sleep. The next morning, wake up and shower, step out of the shower with a nice tan. I double coated this the first time knowing the brown guide would wash off, the result was a natural looking light brown tan, very nice for winter. I&#x27;m going to triple coat it tonight for deeper results. So all in all, I will continue buying this. Oh and the dry time is about 2 minutes.  Yes it leaves you a little sticky but not bad at all. In fact, this is the fastest drying self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used (and there have been a lot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice, use this at night, sleep with it on and I think you&#x27;ll be happy with the results. IMO it was a good find.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of cosmetic products, but when I needed to tone down the fish belly white on my legs for a special party, I turned to sunless tanning lotion.  I&#x27;ve never used another one, and this was the one the drug store had, so I bought it.  Having read the reviews of similar products, I was wary and started about a week ahead of the party.&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT easy to apply evenly!  I took care to put on only a light coating and smooth it out to what felt even on my legs.  The immediate effect is okay.  I don&#x27;t really like the sparkle effect, but whatever.  After I showered the next morning, about half the color washed off, including the blotches where I had put it on unevenly.  The next night I put on another coat, thicker this time.  Again, blotches and half of it washed off with soap and water and only a little scrubbing on the blotches with a luffa. Third and last time was \\&quot;good enough\\&quot;.  I could see a difference between my lower legs where I had applied the lotion and my thighs which were still white.&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion is that this is probably a good product if you use it frequently and get good at applying it.  But for a one-time, instant tan the night before or afternoon of the event, better to save yourself the money.  I didn&#x27;t notice an unpleasant smell, mentioned by some, but odors are very individual.  I think next time I&#x27;ll pass.</li>
    <li> I like the kind of glow this tanner gives, and yes, it&#x27;s wonderful that it&#x27;s tinted so you can actually see where you are putting the cream so you don&#x27;t miss spots, but I do find this tanning lotion to be a bit overpowering in the smell department. I have used Famous Dave&#x27;s Moisture Tan and like it BUT the only problem with that one is it is not tinted so if you miss a spot or two during the application, you will only see the mistake the next day.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for years.  I am actually fair skinned but find that if I apply it infrequently it lasts a couple of weeks and gives a nice glow to my chicken-white legs.  I also like how smooth and soft it makes my skin as well as the faint sparkle.  The tint really helps you to see where it is streaky or missing.</li>
    <li> I am a first time user of this product.  I usually use a Jergen&#x27;s self tanner, but the store was out the last time I went in, so I decided to try this, because it had both a bronzer and self tanner.    I will start off by saying I am extremely fair skinned, and found this went on easily, doesn&#x27;t seem to be streaky (the bronzer helps with making the application even), and it smells very nice after developing.  I usually can&#x27;t stand how most self tanners smell after they develop.  It did make me a little rashy, but not itchy.    That being said, I had no idea beforehand about the glitter.  I put it on, and noticed right away that there seemed to be reflective, glittery speckles everywhere.  I feel like a tanned Twilight vampire.  It&#x27;s a little weird.    I will finish my bottle, but will probably switch to something else next time.</li>
    <li> I cannot comment on the tan this product may or may not give, as I am instantly turned off by the glitter!  I thought maybe it would wear off, but hours later I am still sparkling.  Maybe ok if I&#x27;m going out on the town, but for the most part I&#x27;m just throwing on a pair of jeans and off to run errands - so I look like I&#x27;m trying to be all fancy at the grocery store and such.  Not for me!</li>
    <li> This product contains glitter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. People compliment me on my Summer tan, but I never tan: I use spf15 sunscreen with SB over it! Yes, sparkles are involved here. But don&#x27;t worry about the sparkles--they only show up as much as the shine on silk stockings unless you look really close! This product works best when cut half and half with moisturizing lotion. (My opinion!) Otherwise it darkens the toes and ankles too much. With 3 applications you should get the effect you want--it streaks a bit on the first couple of applications, no matter how adept you are at putting it on. Use disposable latex gloves (rinse and use over &amp; over!) to apply, and keep rubbing and smearing in until all the moisture is absorbed into your skin--this will increase your chances of getting a streak-free application.</li>
    <li> I still have tanned legs with this product - even though the summer is gone.  If you use it as directed it really works.  I gave it to my daughters for their birthdays as an extra gift and they like it also.</li>
    <li> This product provides a very natural-looking, smooth tan, if applied properly (think applying sunscreen evenly to avoid weird tan/burn spots).  It smells rather strongly of a slightly floral perfume, which I like, but may not appeal to others.  It dries super-fast, which is great for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t have time to stand around naked while lotion dries, BUT if you apply it to your entire body (as I do), your palms will be heavily tinted by the end, even after washing.  Maybe I should apply it with the backs of my hands! :-) It does glitter, but I don&#x27;t find it very noticeable unless one is in a bright light and looks closely.  It does not appear to come off on clothing, which is a huge plus for me because I hated the tanners that came off wherever I sweated and stained my towels after a shower.  It also keeps my skin soft and smooth.  Overall, it&#x27;s the best tanner I have used and I will continue to use it.  But, since aesthetics are individual, here&#x27;s how the tanners I have tried line up, in my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Body Expertise Sublime Bronze Tinted Self-Tanning Lotion Medium: Very natural color, has immediate effect. Scent: Slightly floral perfume Drying time: Very fast--couple of minutes max Effect on clothing: Nothing apparent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Body Expertise Sublime Glow Medium: Color: Very natural, has some initial effect, but builds gradually over time Scent: Very chemical--typical tanner smell Drying time: Allow a few minutes Effect on clothing: Comes off easily with sweat and any wetness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jergens Natural Glow Medium to Tan: Color: Natural, has some initial effect, but builds gradually over time Scent: Chemical--typical tanner smell Drying time: Allow at least a few minutes Effect on clothing: Comes off very easily with sweat and wetness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jergens Natural Glow Face Medium to Tan Natural Color: Very natural, has some initial effect, but builds gradually over time; has added benefit of sunscreen Scent: Slightly chemical Drying time: Allow at least a few minutes Effect on clothing: Comes off  easily with sweat and wetness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea Sun-Kissed Radiance Fair to Medium: Color: A little on the orange side Scent: Light, citrus overlaying chemical Drying time: Allow a few minutes Effect on clothing:Nothing apparent</li>
    <li> Great temporary tint! I mix a nickel sized dollop of tint with a triple sized amount of body lotion in my hands before applying it to my legs, arms, and decolletage, and am careful to make sure I have applied it evenly. The result is natural looking &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34; If I want I can wash it off with a little soap and water or I can add to it for a couple of days to deepen the tan. That&#x27;s about as long as it lasts before becoming streaky from showering. Best to wash your hands with soap and water after applying in order not to have orange areas between your fingers.</li>
    <li> Not good.  It has an unpleasant smell.  It looks orangy and does not look natural, especially on the feet and ankles.  I did not use it for a couple days and now it is wearing off and my skin looks splotchy like I have vitiligo.  Ugh.</li>
    <li> This product has always worked great for me. I have a light brown complexion which gets a bit sallow by end of winter. This is a safe way to look tanned and even your complexion without risking the danger of a tanning bed. Applied correctly, there is no streaking. Just don&#x27;t forget to wash your hands after applyng!!!</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Smells like chemucals and doesn&#x27;t give color.. Maybe a hint. I am fair skinned and still need to order dark to get a nice glow.. Don&#x27;t bother with medium shades..</li>
    <li> Gives me just the right amount of tan!</li>
    <li> The color and shimmer effects from using this product is nice. You come out with a golden glow versus coming out orangey. Some heads up. I am 65. It WILL accentuate your age spots and freckles. It is a &amp;#34;stainer&amp;#34; and will rub off on your lightly colored bath towels if you don&#x27;t shower-and-scrub thoroughly. Apply evenly or you&#x27;ll get streaks and darkened areas where applied twice.</li>
    <li> The color after just one application is subtle enough even on very fair skin to just take the edge off the whiteness! I use it just on my legs and it doesnt scream &amp;#34;look her legs are tan but the rest of her isnt!&amp;#34;  It dries quickly but can feel a little tacky the first few hours even when dry. It does have a slight glitter to it which is nice.</li>
    <li> The old formula back in the day, say sometime around 2005 was great- It never streaked and looked pretty natural-This stuff glitters and streaks and looks fake as the day is long. It also wears off in flakes and looks worse and worse as time goes on. I suspect this has to do with it having Vitamin E in it which causes skin to exfoliate.. Exfoliate before you tan, not after!  I am about as pale as you can get, think Nicole Kidman or perhaps paler,ha-- I recommend Banana Boat Deep.. blend with a fragrance free body lotion and the results are great.</li>
    <li> Aside from looking like a zebra, I really do love the color and glitter that this lotion turns to be.  The packaging says streak free, however, that is definitely not the case.  Maybe I did not apply it correctly, but I followed the instructions as closely as I possibly could.  I washed my hands like a madwoman, and a few hours after applying it, I thought it looked great.  I went to bed, woke up, and my hands and feet were a complete disaster.  My husband and I went to Walmart shortly thereafter, but halfway up to the door I went to hold his hand and my palms were a bright orange so I turned back and high-tailed it to my car in horror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did this on a Thursday evening because I have three days for it to wear off before work on Monday, but there is an almost-full container of this stuff that is going promptly in the trash can.  My best friend also got this, and a few moments ago texted me that she, too, was very streaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this, especially given the great reviews, but I honestly don&#x27;t see how anyone could give it over three stars.  Hopefully, I&#x27;ll find a better product soon before I&#x27;m overly pasty again.</li>
    <li> This stuff gets into my pores and creates blackheads, other than that it&#x27;s ok for a quick tan. One way to get rid of the glitter is to wait about an hour or longer and apply hand lotion over the tan.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations when purchasing this product. I have a cappuccino complexion and really wanted to be as dark as possible.  If anything this product makes me lighter with a orangy hue.</li>
    <li> Cant mess this one up. I mix with my regular daily lotion to calm the shimmer and works great for me!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My wal-mart stopped selling it I guess so I decided to try the banana boat self tanners, jergens, the loreal airbrush form,etc etc etc.. I hate them all. Take way too long to dry and when I shave I have razor lines. When applying loreal sublime bronze on I always make sure that I am completely dry. Then I lotion it all over my body (not face because I break out) and with mmy knees, elbows, neck, feet, I half the tanner and lotion and rub it in my hands then apply lightly. After that I either blow dry my self dry, go naked for about 15 - 20 mins, or wear a robe/shirt until its time to dress. Then I wash my palms off with a wet rag. I dont care what anyone says this stuff is better than tanning salons tan sprays and any other product out there. The best thing about this stuff is if you decide to just tan your legs or etcs it fades in with the lighter part of your body instead of a straight line from dark to light.... LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. I also love that I can put lotion on over after 30 mins. I use it 3-4 times a week once a day and during the summer 2-3 times a day and it looks even better when I have an actual tan to go over it. But anyways yea this stuff is the best in my opinion. I am never without it. Until now while I wait for it to come in lol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product all summer.  I really like the brown, non-orangy color I get from it.  The only thing I dislike is the glitter.  I usually exfoliate and apply it at night then showering in the morning to avoid the glitter look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  It&#x27;s still hard to get it perfectly applied, but it&#x27;s better than most.</li>
    <li> Great product doesn&#x27;t leave orange skin tones and goes on smooth</li>
    <li> This is horrible!&lt;br /&gt;I use to Sublime years ago, it was never that great, but at least good for a quick tan.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using two or three others brands; Jergens, Sun Labs, even B,B &amp;B&#x27;s generic. I am really unpicky and will use pretty much anything. I have been self tanning for years and am rarely not tan. I was out and wanted something quick, so I just ran to the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money! It stinks like bad men&#x27;s cologne, it goes on horribly. Does not produce hardly any color, what color it does produce is streaky. Other have commented on glitter, heavens, it&#x27;s ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the aggravation and money, you&#x27;ll end up looking worse than when you started.</li>
    <li> LOVE this self-tanner, except for the glitter/shimmer, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The glitter/shimmer does wash off, but of course you have to wait until the color&#x27;s completely developed (I wait until the next morning). Product has a nice scent, as opposed to the usual chemical scent most have. It&#x27;s sticky until it dries, but it does dry quickly and the color is great, and non-streaky if you&#x27;ve prepped your skin and applied correctly.  Very natural color, I initially used it just on my legs and when I went into work the next day, several people asked me if I&#x27;d been laying out in the sun - the color is very natural on me, in artifical and in sunlight.  I will buy this again!</li>
