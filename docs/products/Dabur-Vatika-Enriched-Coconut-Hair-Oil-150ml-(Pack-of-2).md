<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the smell, works very well on 4C hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product a short time and I have already noticed my hair is so much softer. I&#x27;m glad it was recommended</li>
    <li> First I think it&#x27;s important to address the fact that yes it is a solid in a bottle. I knew this, but some of the reviewers didn&#x27;t seem to realize it and the \\&quot;problem\\&quot; is one that you would have with any coconut oil-based product. I put it between my boobs (I know that&#x27;s weird) to heat it up while I&#x27;m parting my hair and spraying on some aloe, and it always liquifies by the time I&#x27;m ready to use it (just a few minutes, really). Afterwards I give it a good shake and I&#x27;m ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles arrived with tops that have indentations you have to stick something in to open a hole, and the plastic is thick so it takes some doing. This may be nitpicky, but I&#x27;m not so sure why this is necessary as it&#x27;s capped and it is generally a solid. I believe I read someone&#x27;s review that said that if you squeeze too hard the little inner cap pops off, and this did happen to my mother, to whom I gifted one of the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truthfully, I ended up taking it back from my mother because it didn&#x27;t suit her needs, and I think based on your type of hair you can have wildly different experiences with the product. My mother and I are both black but she has fine, semi-straight hair and mine is very thick and very curly. The oil for her, even in moderation, was too slick and just sort of slid around her scalp. My hair drinks it up, but almost to the extent that it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s doing anything. I do use aloe first, after some trial and error with using it on dry hair and after shampooing, and I think that helps a bit. I am in love with the scent though, so I don&#x27;t mind using a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister, who is biracial, has the best results with this product. Her hair is wavy and pretty thick, and she gets the best shine and smoothness from this, even when her hair is dry. Her daughters have good results too. We all have natural hair, but it does seem like something that could work on relaxed hair for shine purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think this does anything spectacular, especially depending upon your hair type, but it is a good oil. It smells better, in my opinion, than regular coconut oil, but I don&#x27;t think it does much more than regular coconut oil. That said, it certainly smells delicious to me, and a little bit goes a long way for several types of hair. I definitely don&#x27;t think it could hurt anyone&#x27;s haircare regimen, and I do like it for skin, much like I like coconut oil, which is an added benefit.</li>
    <li> I love this product,added bonus is i got to bottles for this price it works so well on my hair. I will definitely buy this product again!!</li>
    <li> I use this product because I have very dry scalp. It helps to moisten my scalp and it keeps my hair soft. As strange as it may seem it also keeps the grays away. And If you want to grow your hair out this will help with that as well. I don&#x27;t particularly care for the smell. so I don&#x27;t use a lot of it and I only use it at night.</li>
    <li> I really love this oil!!! It gives your hair strength and shine without making it oily. It has a nice cinnamon aroma to it as well. It only takes a small amount and it leaves your hair so soft, you will want to keep touching your hair!!</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff!  I use it for a pre-shampoo treatment and add it to my deep conditioner.  The smell is kinda like an earthy. lemony type situation.  It&#x27;s kinda strong and can stick with you for a bit, but I don&#x27;t find it terribly offensive.  I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times, but I&#x27;m looking forward to the benefits of lessened hairfall and increased growth and strength from the additional herbs.</li>
    <li> In the bottled it is like coconut oil. Hard at room temperature.</li>
    <li> Ignore all the the bad reviews which complain about the product being in a solid form when it arrives. It seems they don&#x27;t realize what coconut oil looks like at room/cold temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the oil itself, works very well as a warm/hot oil conditioning treatment. I leave it in my hair for about 4 hours, then wash as usual. It will strengthen your hair, I don&#x27;t think it will necessarily thicken your hair, it may improve your hair in terms of holding water , which may come out to thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;It actually brings out a deeper color of your hair, not really color it. To some, its a desirable aspect. It&#x27;s not really a hair you should be applying to your roots for all day leave-in, I think it would weight down if followed up by styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other then that, a great buy. Its a hair oil, not a miracle oil!</li>
    <li> My hair has never been this healthy and shiny. Makes my natural hair soft. I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed to natural and this definitely helps.</li>
    <li> We live in CO and the dry air hear has been murder on my two year old&#x27;s very curly hair. I&#x27;ve been using this about three times a week for two weeks and man is his hair much better. It is no longer a brittle course mess. His curls actually look like curls again and it is easier (not easy mind ya but a LOT easier) to comb any tangles out. I was worried based on some comments about the smell. I was expecting a very strong coconut smell, similar to the way sunblock smells, but it wasn&#x27;t that strong. It takes less than 90 seconds running under hot tap water to turn it from a solid to a liquid. Three or four drops does his head and I rub the residue into my own hair and it is helping with my dry scalp (again thanks to the very dry air here in CO).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a thick paste that won&#x27;t come out of the bottle!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle it&#x27;s probably easier just to use plane coconut oil and put Henna in your hair every once in a while The Henna is what helps they hair fall to stop, but you need that coconut oil to moisturize otherwise it&#x27;s all dry on the ends but I recommend this if you don&#x27;t use Henna</li>
    <li> It suck. Didn&#x27;t do nothing:/</li>
    <li> I was really excited about the extra benefits this product had to offer...so far it&#x27;s a plus for me.</li>
    <li> Good oil for gaining and retaining healthy hair!</li>
    <li> I ordered pack of 2 but got only 1 small bottle of this product....very disappointed that paid extra money</li>
    <li> The product turned solid and the bottle I received was not the bottle in the picture, the bottle I got was half the size of the bottle in the picture. The product may work but I have to melt it first.</li>
    <li> Let me just say this product works and a little does go a long way. I&#x27;ve been natural for 5 months now and my hair is very dry naturally. I use  this Vatika Oil after I co-wash... while the hair is still wet and it keeps me for about three days! Hey, look at it this way, what do you have to lose? Good Luck my beautiful Naturals!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using vatika.  I love it!  It&#x27;s super  moisturizing!  It can solidify therefore making it a little hard to come out.  All you have to do is run the bottle under warm water.  And shipping was very timely.  I will order again!</li>
    <li> I use this oil as a pre-poo and a sealer.  It has a sort of earthy aroma that I like.  And it&#x27;s very good for my scalp.  It can be used as a liquid or a solid.  Which can be convenient depending on what you&#x27;re doing with your hair.  Try it!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, perfect product. Very good for your hair, grows hair, makes your hair feel and look healthy, I do recommend. I use every night when I come from work.</li>
    <li> This is great to use as deep conditioner, adding amla and brahmi powders together. However putting it directly on dry hair is not a good idea, since no matter how little I try it is still too oily. The bottle is a terrible design and pretty much useless in the cool days.</li>
    <li> Coconut oil with bonus incentives and yes it does the job so I will be purchasing this again. There is nothing wrong with going natural just gotta know what your doing.</li>
    <li> I have dry blonde brittle hair ... I&#x27;m trying to grow to my mid back . I am 39 and swim a lot . I started sleeping in this not really thinking it would do anything but the next day after I wash it out my hair is alive and shiny and feels sooo good !! Def will keep in my regimen. This was great price though ill probably just buy at Walmart now .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not convenient to use. Need to be warmed it up to melt before using.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It smells really good and it does work well.  It hydrates the hair and smells soooo good.</li>
    <li> I use this product as part of my hot oil treatments.  I use this product when I do twist outs or braid outs on top of my cantu shea butter leave in conditioner.  It leaves hair hair ubber soft and ubber moisturized.  Even when i retwist at night I use this on my ends. It is not heavy and does not weigh my hair down.  I will repurchase.  I am natural and I have coarse 3c-4b hair all throughout my head.  So it works on my spongy texture hair.  I also have low porosity hair and this is wonderful on it.</li>
    <li> Works great for my hair that is type 3B-3C African American. I only use on my scalp, using it on the hair causes a bad smell when build-up occurs.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that my hair is longer, healthier and I have a lot less scalp itching as well.</li>
    <li> I love it on my curly hair! It smells great too.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. I have 4c type hair, and this is the only product that makes my very course hair soft, and straight. I ordered more the very next day.</li>
    <li> shipped quickly. all coconut oil products are great!</li>
    <li> Terrible.  It wouldn&#x27;t even come out of the bottle.  It is a solid mass in the bottle of no use to me.</li>
    <li> Processed hair?? Lemme tell you, this here is what you need. First,  coconut oil is a solid and it is imperative that you treat it like a hot oil treatment, meaning heat up the bottle...it works best if you leave on overnight, wash out with a shampoo or even just a conditioner...silky nd weightless, image how you think an angels hair would feel...that is what you get. Freaking awesome!!!</li>
    <li> It was good when I first started using it but then it was no longer affective..... Smells like medicine</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Makes my hair so soft and detangles great. I&#x27;m a 4c natural.</li>
    <li> Purchased this about a month or so ago and it works great. Keeps my hair very well moisturized. The smell isn&#x27;t the best but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. When used daily I feel a tingling feeling which leads me to believe its working and doing what it should. Haven&#x27;t experienced any negative side effects. Does wonders for my natural hair also great when used as a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> So awesome I love this hair oil, and it smells great! I did a lot of research on this before I bought it so Im happy about this product and I have two bottles!</li>
    <li> I did much research and read many comments on this product before purchasing it and honestly I don&#x27;t understand why they&#x27;re any negative comments at all. I&#x27;m Dominican &amp; African American with thick, mildly coarse hair &amp; this oil made my hair soft, silky and look amazingly healthy!!! I also noticed no one who is transitioning from Relaxed to Natural commented or mentioned. I am transitioning and tend to keep my hair mostly straight and down and this oil helps me keep straight, moves my hair and makes it SHINE!! ... Now many ppl use it differently, I use a little at night when I do my doobie wrap and when I do a hot oil treatment I sometimes mix it with a hot Carrot oil. Only do a little cuz its very true A LOT GOES ALONG WAY. I use a small applicator bottle I bought at my local Beauty Supply for 2.00, it really help.s. Suggestion, part hair in 4 each side and dab a little. That way your roots don&#x27;t dry and straighten out a little better (remember this is for transitioners).</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! After I found out about it after doing some research on going natural and natural hair care. It makes my hair look &amp; feel so soft and moisturized for long period of time. My hair text is 4a/4b so this is a god send. The smell is not bad it has an okay scent. Either way though it&#x27;s what I use now for twisting, braiding and after co washing my hair.</li>
    <li> This product does make your hair a bit greasy, but if you only apply it to your ends, it works wonders! This oil has allot of ingredients that stimulate hair growth and my hair looks so shiny and soft! I would only use this as a pre shampoo, but if you are really scared of your hair getting oily then like I said only apply it to your ends. I love the smell of the coconut oil and I can count on this oily repairing my damaged dry hair! I would not recommend using this product more than once a week, pick a day where you don&#x27;t plan on seeing anyone if you use it all over your head. Honestly... one day of greasy hair will be worth it when my hair is long and healthy!</li>
    <li> my hair is very shiny and healthy now since I&#x27;ve started using this... my hair is thicker too now... I love it!</li>
    <li> Tried this a couple of years ago on natural hair with good results; used on braided hair, even better resuslts. A friend used a bottle of mine on relaxed hair and had phenomenal results. In a matter of weeks, had significant growth and less breakage. Basically, with continued use, experienced improved and more impressive results. On grey hair, did not notice a color change, but definitely a sheen; on flatironed hair-softer, silky, body and sheen. This may not be the experience for everyone, but it worked here. Love the scent, kind of reminds one of incense. Initially purchased on Amazon, but also found in local Indian grocery stores.</li>
    <li> I received the product on time, in great secure packaging, and the right product. I love coconut oil for my hair and this product delivered.</li>
    <li> I have only had this product about three weeks so I cant say for sure . but i like what i see so far.</li>
    <li> the oil did not come in the bottle as pictured. it was much smaller but it served its purposed. not bad</li>
    <li> I only came back to this to look at others&#x27; reviews to figure out how to get this out of the bottle. I see people say heat it up..so I&#x27;m going to try that. As for other aspects, it arrived the day it said it would and smells like coconut and its a yummy coconut smell! So hopefully I can figure this thing out...because this stuff should last me like a year or something!!!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product.  It seems to help keep my hair soft.  If you melt it it will remain liquid until the temperature drops below room temperature.  It is slightly difficult to puncture the seal but once it is puncture it comes out nicely after melting.</li>
    <li> Great product and price. Arrived quickly and just what i ordered.</li>
    <li> Alright, this is odd.  I removed the lid and puctured the center of the white plastic seal on the bottle.  Then I put the lid back on tight, and put the bottle into the bathroom sink, which was filled with hot water.  I returned 10 minutes to find oil in the sink, because somehow, it had leaked out of the bottle.  I couldn&#x27;t find a leak, but it leaked alright, and for all I know water leaked into the container.  Did I do something wrong?  Has anyone else experienced this?</li>
    <li> I have telex/relax hair and I wanted to try this product for my the ends of my hair. im very happy so far I think I will buy this product again</li>
    <li> Good product to keep hair silky soft, but beware  long term use of this product turns your hair darker in color.</li>
    <li> Really just wanted to rate it. I hate leaving comments for things like oil. Am I supposed to be shocked and surprised by something? Should it astound and amaze me like my first orgasm?</li>
    <li> I love this product. I apply at night before bed a d wash in the a.m. it leaves my frixxy hair very silky. I will order again and recommend this site. Delivery was earlier than expected. Great!</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but I just bought this for the third time so I thought I would write one.  I have very long (butt length) thick, curly, color treated, dry hair.  It gets extremely dry at the ends and a little greasy at the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product once or twice a week.  I melt it in hot tap water then use my fingers to completely saturate my hair.  Then I brush it until it is evenly distributed, then I add some more to the ends where it is the most dry.  After that I clip it up and put a hair cap over it.  You can get those anywhere, especially if the store has an ethnic hair care section.  It will keep the oil on your hair and from getting on whatever you touch.  Then I go to sleep with it like that.  In the morning I shampoo and condition like normal and my hair comes out beautifully.  It is frizz free, shiny and soft and with no oily residue or anything.  I really do love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have one complaint and its not enough to remove a star for but I wish it came in other scents.  The scent doesn&#x27;t linger on your hair once its washed out or anything but I don&#x27;t love the slightly medicinal scent of the product...</li>
    <li> I love Brhami (sp!) and Bringaraj (sp!) for my hair but was always a little tentative about the potential drying effects of Amla -- it&#x27;s one of the main ingredients so be warned.  I&#x27;d rather purchase single \\&quot;herb\\&quot; oils from Banyan or local health food store and make my own.</li>
    <li> I read most of the reviews on this privative and positive both. I personally love it. I don&#x27;t find that it has an unpleasant scent at all. Nor do I find it hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. If the product comes to you and it&#x27;s \\&quot;cold\\&quot; or you use it and it&#x27;s \\&quot;cold\\&quot; it will look like butter or lard. You have two options....run it under hot tap water or put a bit in the palm of your hand and rub...it melts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. In the morning apply it to dry hair (focus on ends and add a bit through the rest finger combing through)then brush through (with a boar hair bristle brush), pull hair up into a bun and secure (I have over 2ft. of hair, I use an elastic, and a few bobby pins), add a flower clip, and go about my day&lt;br /&gt;2. In the evening shower and wash my hair with Nexxus for split ends shampoo and conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have slept with it in my hair and my pillow was fine. I focused on the ends, pulled my hair up with an elastic into a high ponytail, braided my hair and rolled the braid into a bun, secured it, and in the morning either brush through (with the boar hair bristle brush), reshaped it into an up-do, or washed it out with the Nexxus for split ends shampoo and conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am of mixed race Caucasian and Asian with very straight hair. I very seldom use heated styling tools on my hair (when I want to curl my hair I set it the old fashioned way the night before usually or create a clever up-do in the morning and let it down for the evening events. My hair had some damage on the ends and some dryness but after less than a week and only a few uses of this product I almost can&#x27;t stop touching my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair as of this moment&lt;br /&gt;Very soft but not greasy...beautiful shine, some dryness on the ends but nothing a tiny trim won&#x27;t cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t expect&lt;br /&gt;This product to make my hair grow longer, thicker, or faster&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do expect&lt;br /&gt;This product to  make my hair softer and more manageable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things I have used this product for&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer on my face (would not suggest if you have oily skin. I have dry patches around my eyes and some from sunburns)&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and soften skin and course hair for shaving (works great on underarms, wash your deodorant off and apply the Vitika, shower normal and use your shaving gel or cream as you would under your arms)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally for me I like this product a lot and I am glad I found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things I have used this product for&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer on my face (would not suggest if you have oily skin.

    <li> This product is like no other. It&#x27;s amazing. I used it the same way done in the commercial and it actually worked.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil for the hair. It&#x27;s not sticky or heavy and leaves my hair amazing.</li>
    <li> Too greasy and made my hair too hard!</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair super soft and left my hair with a slight red tint! I completely recommend this!</li>
    <li> A very good and nourishing for pre- shampooing, leaves the hair soft and smooth!  Once a week it will keep your hair in excellent condition!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy and weighed down.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this. I washed my hair with Suave Naturals with Shea Butter. I put this on after and let my hair air dry. I flat ironed it a few hours later. My hair feels so soft! I have 1/3 white, 1/3 black, and 1/3 Native American hair. I have not had a relaxer in about 5 years but I do have dyed hair (blonde/red). The day I used this, I had an afro for about 2 weeks. My hair feels and looks like it did when I was getting relaxers. I will be buying this in bulk next time I order. This stuff is truly amazing!!</li>
    <li> Great for my hair. I love it. It controls hair fall as well. This is not smelling purely of coconut and has a bit of a nice sweet scent to it which I have grown to love very much. Really good for the winter time.</li>
    <li> So far so good. just started using it recently. I put a few drops of oil and massage my head with it after shower. I do not get that oily head feeling. oil seems light.</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is absolutely the BOMB!! My hair loves it so much. Great great product!! As soon as my oil is low I&#x27;m definely ordering more and more. I got this oil because of a recommendation from a YouTube member and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> After reading all the glowing reviews about this oil, I decided to buy it and try it for myself.  Well, after using once a week for several months, I saw no significant difference in my hair.  It did not make my hair grow any faster and it did not darken any of the few grays that I have.  Also, the smell isn&#x27;t the best either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing oil helped out a little bit with was dry scalp, but I could have gotten that with any hot oil treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m very neutral about this product. I don&#x27;t love it or hate it, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the fresh scent of this oil on my AA natural hair. As far as its moisturizing capabilities it wasn&#x27;t bad at all. I mostly used it as a sealant. I don&#x27;t feel like it can moisturize like natural - organic unscented coconut oil but it is definitely the next best thing.</li>
    <li> Oh no, I don&#x27;t like the smell of this coconut oil! That&#x27;s it, that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> Very smooth, makes my hair natural shiny and soft . Good amount per dollar. I would recommend to anyone to use</li>
    <li> I love this hair product and it moisturizes my hair in a way that reminds me of being in tropical weather.</li>
    <li> the smell was strong for me but it was okay</li>
    <li> Oil base and is very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: After shampooing and towel drying hair Mix with egg yolk and put on ends of your hair. Leave it in 15 minutes. Wash out with warm water. once a week. Prevents split ends and promotes healthy hair.</li>
    <li> This is super coconut oil. I transfer it to an applicator bottle for ease of use. If you&#x27;re natural and have slow growing hair, add this to your hair care routine and you&#x27;ll wonder why you hadn&#x27;t before.</li>
    <li> It smells good and is the consistancy of crisco shortening and difficult to get out of what is supposed to be a squeeze bottle.  Be sure to watch the U-tube videos before buying or using it on your hair because it contains henna and lemon oil and it possibly can/will lighten your hair to a redish color.</li>
    <li> I love the rich blend of natural essential oils in Vatika, I&#x27;ve used this product as a sealant to deep condition, moisturize &amp; repair my hair. I love the results and still use it over a year later today.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok, but not for evry day use to oiling. One or two time a week i thing working ok.</li>
    <li> Good for keeping your scalp moisturized and also smells good. Really healthy. Came on time and was done the right way. Will buy again from you all. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This oil is perfect...don&#x27;t leave smell in my hair...is easy to use...I normally use before bedtime. I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> Make sure you shake bottle well.  Product gets very thick if not mixed before using.  Smells nice-hair softens and fragrant.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this item the other day and I gotta say, I LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself is not watered down and it&#x27;s fairly thick so there&#x27;s no need to use large amounts of substance when applying to the hair, especially if you have short SHORT hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would suggest using this at night and wrapped underneath whatever scarf you use so your hair can be in better condition when you&#x27;re awake. But there is nothing wrong using it throughout the day if you don&#x27;t mind walking around with a natural lemony, plant scent on your hair all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, the smell is fantastic but strong.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS OIL......and I don&#x27;t see what all the fuss is  about getting the product out of the bottle!When it arrived it was already liquefied due to the heat outside.I punched a huge hole at the top of the bottle with scissors and that took all of a second...I decided it would be perfect in an applicator bottle..poured it in there and that was it..no hassles etc.It did turn back into a solid so I just put the bottle in hot water and after a minute or two it was back to its glorious self lol.This is really a great buy...you can&#x27;t beat the price and you get two bottles.I put it all over my daughter&#x27;s wet hair  she has soft curly hair and then cleansed it..her hair was super soft and her scalp isn&#x27;t dry like it was before...I put it on my scalp while my hair was dry and it is soft and shiny! MY HAIR IS COURSE LOL BUT IT will work on a lot of different types of hair..give it a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dandruff while in Maldives. It is the only product that I found to work. Plus I put it on my skin for my sin poisoning and I haven&#x27;t been having any reactions, even with sunscreen.</li>
    <li> It is too hard to get out of the bottle, other than that it is alright.</li>
    <li> would have given it more stars if it didnt have mineral oil and a scent that sometimes becomes annoying. but its good to use before doing henna treatment</li>
    <li> I appreciate that it comes in a 2 pack, but it was way too difficult. Number 1, it was impossible to get out without assaulting the bottle, finally gave up an scooped it out. 2. It was in a solidified form, that made it difficult to gauge about how much oil I was really getting until it was too late. It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> I got the coconut hair oil a few days ago. I really like how it makes my hair super shiny and even my ends that are in a major need of a trim look so much better. When I got the oil it was hard to get out because it was frozen so I had to let it sit for a little bit in hot water. After it thawed out I put a bunch in my hair and let it sit over night and washed it the next morning. I dried my hair and I didn&#x27;t even need to straighten it. My hair was really manageable and felt really soft. I have it in my hair right now! Great price too!!</li>
    <li> Not the best smell in the world but after using this product, my hair is shinier, softer and just beautiful. I should also mention that before using this product, i was using just the regular coconut oil for a week (every other day). I would apply some to my hair and leave it an hour (if i don&#x27;t have any plans for the day) before i take a shower or sometimes over night. I stopped using the coconut oil because i have this one now. I use this product after taking a shower. When my hair is slightly damp. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> These came really solid and chunky. I have to keep sitting the bottle in warm water to loosen the oil and get it on my hair. The odor is strong overnight. I find the jars of coconut oils respond to temperature better. You can&#x27;t smell them either.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, reminds me of the traditional grater cake and coconut drops I grew upon in Jamaica but way too greasy for my natural hair. My hair is a coily thick texture but soft to touch ( I have a three mixes in my family) for now I use it when ever the times is cold and the air is dry. Makes my hair look really black and shiny leading to health looking hair. Will repurchase after I am out.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product..keeps my natural hair moisturized and soft without the loud coconut smell.  This product smells more like lemons.  This is my third re-order.. Delivery was quick and the price is outstanding.</li>
    <li> I mix this in my hair conditioner with rosemary and peppermint oils and it works great! My hair looks better than ever. The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t smell fabulous - not a bad smell, just not a great smell. However, the scent isn&#x27;t off-putting and you can&#x27;t smell it in my hair.</li>
    <li> **Warning** If you have fine, blonde hair, this product will make your hair extremely greasy and dirty looking. The oil in the bottle is rock solid hard. I warmed it up in warm water with no results, then popped it in the microwave for a few seconds (which did seem to work). I had to pierce the cork multiple times, otherwise the cork would pop out and make a huge mess. Definitely not a fan of this product. On the plus side, the coconut hair oil works great on callused heels and rough elbows (if you can handle the greasy feeling).</li>
    <li> Very good product, started using coconut oil in my hair. It leaves your hair well conditioned, and soft, not frizzy. Can&#x27;t use too much though hair will look greasy, it is an oil,. Good product.</li>
    <li> I wear my hair natural curly and it frequently dries out and breaks. I use a small amount to style my hair and on weekends I use a lot to deep condition prior to washing. TIP: when the temperature chills this lotion solidifies so you may have to run warm water over the bottle to liquefy before use.</li>
    <li> Product inside bottle is hard,  you must put bottle in hot water to melt so you can use it each time. Product doesn&#x27;t tell you this, I figured it out. Smells ok, good price. Does help soften hair.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is that this product helped me a lot. My hair is growing in two weeks that I started to use it. I highly recommeded.</li>
    <li> Not the best smell so I use at nights instead.</li>
    <li> I read over 700 Amazon reviews before I bought this product. (Where you&#x27;re reading now is only one of nine places I found on  Amazon with Vatika coconut oil reviews.)  I now have phrases like &amp;#34;wavy swavy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;pre-poo&amp;#34; as part of my working vocabulary.&lt;br /&gt;  I did not puncture the plastic cork, but simply remove and replace it each time.&lt;br /&gt; I squeeze out a small amount from the flexible plastic container into a little glass dish and microwave for 25-30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;  I do the ends of my hair first;  use my fingers to distribute through the rest of my hair and scalp; and use a designated comb to distribute evenly.&lt;br /&gt; I use a small travel towel, turban-style, and leave the oil on for at least 45 minutes. Sometimes I warm the towel in my clothes drier.&lt;br /&gt; This product did not change my hair color.&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it three stars because I find that I have to shampoo and rinse two to (usually) three times to avoid a flat, oily look.</li>
    <li> It works good for me, I like it! No more dry flakes.&lt;br /&gt;No more dryness and itchy scalp. It&#x27;s good!</li>
    <li> I first purchased this during my visit to India, I complimented a young lady on her beautiful hair and skin, she said it was Vatika coconut oil. I have used it many times on my hair and sometimes I use it as a skin moisturizer, better than any lotion I ever used. I can see and feel the difference, added bonus is the wonderful smell, if you try it, I think you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;Side note, I have had my hair in locks for a number of years and it matters a great deal what products I use, and this is a winner.</li>
    <li> love, love  love it !</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> LOVE IT.  It has a nice smell and makes my hair very soft.  I put it in at night and sleep in it, (definitely wash it out next day cause it&#x27;s pretty oily looking!).  I&#x27;d buy this again and again!</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this product. The product itself is ok, but I will stick with regular coconut oil. This product doesnt come out of the bottle easy enough either. You must beat it, shake it and or run it under hot water.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a week ago, and when I received it, the product wasn&#x27;t an oil (anymore!), it was a butter, because I am assuming the oil solidified. Which makes it impossible to pour out of the bottle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am debating whether or not to put it in the microwave and melt the butter... but I don&#x27;t know think the bottle is microwave safe... And the oil may re-solidify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I am seriously disappointed because the product had good reviews.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Your hair will be so shiny, it moisturizers your hair, you have to heat it a bit before using!</li>
    <li> excellent product will be reordering soon, excellent service</li>
    <li> Smells so good, leaves hair super soft and easy to comb out.  A note of warning: only use a tiny bit, 2-3 drops at a time.</li>
    <li> Smell like chemicals, the smell makes me sick, throwed it away.</li>
    <li> Yikes!! I can&#x27;t get past the horrible smell to determine if it works or not. It honestly smells like vomit or mildew. I don&#x27;t want to mix it with anything that smells good for fear that the Vatika oil will ruin it... To the trash it goes - not worth sending it back. One the plus side I received it two or three days after I ordered it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good hair product</li>
    <li> I LOVE using this oil! It is great for using right before you wash your hair- leaves my hair completely conditioned!</li>
    <li> Hi, I must say I am extremely happy with this coconut oil. I love the smell. It has a soft scent to it. I am Hispanic, and my hair is naturally oily in the roots, but my ends are dry, After a few applications (daily for 1 week) I must say I can see the difference. My hair is getting in a much better shape and is extremely soft and has lost of volume. I also recommend Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder 9 Herbs Blend, as it restores your hair to a much healthier condition... Overall this product is a must!</li>
    <li> I have just received this product and I already love it. even my boyfriend tried it on his hair and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I went natural just a year ago and I have been very lazy with taking care of my hair because I have a 4C type of hair (extremely kinky) and always had trouble combing it. So once I received this product I tried it on a portion of hair and I immediately felt a difference, my hair was softer and shinier. Right now I am about to put it on my whole hair and live it overnight before shampooing tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is the smell. It has a very lovely smell. I would definitely recommend this product. The only reason why I am giving this product a 4star is because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a 5star</li>
    <li> Worked great on half-breed hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I cannot believe how soft my hair is and how much it is growing from using this product. A+++</li>
    <li> I personally didn&#x27;t care for this. Maybe its just my hair texture ext., but it wasn&#x27;t working. I&#x27;ll just stick to normal coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Is great for dry skin!</li>
    <li> Wanted to strengthen my hair.. specifically because I felt my hair was getting brittle as a result of swimming.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t say you had to microwave this first, but it&#x27;s amazing, doesn&#x27;t smell all too great, but I love it, it really nourishes my hair when I leave it in overnight. Super thick, so it makes your hair wicked oily, but it&#x27;s good for treatments! Would definitely recommend if your hair is super dead like mine.</li>
    <li> Made my curly hair very manageable. And gave it shine. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> product was exactly as described. I love everything about it; makes my hair feel soft and has a healthy shine after first use. It does have a different smell, but I actually loved it and almost didn&#x27;t want to wash it off after leaving it on my hair overnight!</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely AMAZING for your hair! I would think it&#x27;s good for most hair textures as well. I used it by putting it in my hair and massaging from the scalp down, about an hour before showering. Just shampoo it and all is good. You don&#x27;t even need conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;You can put it in after showering as well, but then it will be used as a sealant. If used before showering on wet hair, it moisturizes it and stops the shampoo from removing as much protein, leaving you with soft, shiny hair.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair very moisturized.  Great to put on your hair overnight.  The only negative of product is it is hard to get out of bottle.  It should be in a jar.</li>
    <li> The combination of oils does a great job with protecting the hair and providng shine. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp, and my hair feels stronger after use. I use it to moisturize braids. I also use it as sort of a conditioning rinse while in the shower. I have put it on dry hair to condition overnight before rinsing it out.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using coconut oil.  I like the way it makes my hair feel.  I do not know if coconut oil is suppose to become more like a thickened substance or not but this product goes from flowing oil to thicker oil (like a grease.)  It has a slightly strong odor.  Overall it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I cant say I love it or hate it, it is just okay.  It&#x27;s not bad for the price and I guess good for those days you feel your hair is dry.</li>
    <li> Do not have to say much because many other people already said very good things about this product, I love it, it doesn&#x27;t smell rancid as I read on another comment, I do not apply this product on dry hair, for me works even better with when my hair is damp, I have had many many other products, some very expensive and most of them were just another waist of money and time, but this one is very affordable and it did something I did not experience with another products which proclaim they are the top of the best, I will buy again, :)</li>
    <li> This hair oil is simply amazing! I have been using it for a couple of months now- once a week, sometimes twice, and I can see great improvement in my hair. I have pretty long hair, and long hair is prone to dry ends, and while there are lots of conditioners out there, most don&#x27;t do much. This oil really works- my hair has become very soft and very shiny, and I hardly ever use conditioners now. Another nice bonus is non-itchy moisturized scalp.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price! And this bottle will last you a long time even if you have thick long hair. No need for expensive Moroccan oil and such.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that coconut oil isn&#x27;t liquid if the temperatures aren&#x27;t high enough, so be sure to keep the bottle in warm water till the oil melts.&lt;br /&gt;For best results I suggest using this oil overnight. Just put some on your palms, massage the scalp, then apply some oil to the rest of your hair- you don&#x27;t need to use a lot- dripping oil doesn&#x27;t do anyone any good. Then just braid your hair, throw a towel on the pillowcase, and rest. I&#x27;ve discovered that blowdrying on hot for a couple of minutes with oil on is great too. After those manipulations, just wash your hair with your regular shampoo- I generally shampoo twice, for very thick hair three times might be better. The oil washes off rather easily actually (comparing to olive or vegetable oil), which was a pleasant surprise.  And then you&#x27;re good to go- air dry, or style the way you always do.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this oil if you want hair like in Pantene commercials.</li>
    <li> Feels really great on my hair and skin.  Good product.</li>
    <li> The bottle is not this bottle. The oil is always hard and it is not able to be poured out.</li>
    <li> Great product for hair and skin! It produced a healthier, more strengthened strand for hair, and moisturized my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I just used it a couple of times. Not sure about the results. But it is solid. I has to use a long small knife to take out a few and heat it up in the microwave. Just not convenient for busy and lazy me:). Hope it helps my hair in the long run.</li>
    <li> I actually got a bundle of two and I really enjoy the application process of this product. it solidifies alil in this el nino jersey wheather but slowly begins to melt in my hands due to body heat. It defines my roots for braidouts since im silly and cant cornrow.I put it on every part of my hair from scalp to tip and wait for my dry hair to soak it up before i put extra ish on it. i have a feeling i will buy more when i run out.thanks Vatika and Amazon!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this very long.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell. I have transferred it to another bottle to be able to heat it up and us more readily. I think it is a great oil for hot oil treatments and deep conditioning.  I was already using coconut oil on my hair and I think this will be even better since it has herbs in it to help with the hair.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain. It is easy to use and does the job. Very moisturizing and great for my hair. I like the bottle</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see a sort of jell rather than oil. It can&#x27;t be \\&quot;poured\\&quot;. But I found it easy to scoop a bit out with a bamboo skewer and wipe it off into my hands where I was able to work it into my hair. Adds moisture, reduces tangles, tames frizzies, nice smell. Love it!</li>
    <li> Tried practically every natural oil to seal my (Natural African) hair, but my ends still remained dry and shedding constantly. I even tried other coconut oils, (pure, organic), but ended up eating them on some pancakes, (which was very good, let me say.....:))  but it didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my hair. Vatika,  was a last result and I am very very satisfied.  Noticed result pretty quickly. Less shedding when I washed my hair and my strands feels notably softer. I love it so much I order two more bottles before I finished with the first one.</li>
    <li> Coconut oil is good for your hair and with the vatika herbal additives i thought it made it all the better. While its is still a good product, there are these little grainy, sand-like substances in the oil which makes it harder to apply to hair.</li>
    <li> Small bottle but smells great and moisturizes really well. Easy pour bottle for better control on how much you&#x27;re using.</li>
    <li> I have thick natural hair that always needs moisturizing and this oil works great!!!!! I use it all the time, as a pre-shampoo treatment, hot oil treatments, sealer for my ends, you name it. It works great as a heat protectant also. It smells heavenly and leaves my strands feeling strong and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product, as it was cheaper than buying the coconut oil at the store. However, I am back to the store bought coconut oil as this one made my hair fall out. I thought it was just a weird one-time thing. But every single time I would use it, my hair would start falling out right after washing it, for about 2 days. I stopped using this oil after about 10 times. Not sure if I got a bad batch or something, but based on what I tried, I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> Love this oil and it is very reasonable for the quality. This is my second set and its my most used hair product. stopped breakage, and it smells great! Ive researched most of the products  in it and they&#x27;re all supposed to be excellent for hair growth, anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, and most importantly all natural. I&#x27;ve bought many different types of oils before but this one is the best so far. No mineral oil included!</li>
    <li> For the most part it does what its supppose to do. It didnt leave an incredible shine, but it was enough. I dont care for the smell too much. I think I will stick to regular coconut oil. Still a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for many years. I also alternate extra virgin coconut oil in my hair occasionally, but feel that this oil has more of a boost in nutrients with the amla and henna. It helps to keep grays away, and I do agree that your scalp has a nice environment for hair growth with this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saturate dry hair with it before washing, and leave it in as long as I can. I part my hair in four sections and am very generous - a teaspoon on the ends of my hair for each section, a teaspoon for the midlengths and roots of each section, and comb through, massaging into my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wrapped hair in a hot towel before to help my hair cuticles open and absorb the oil more, which works well too. Whether with or without heat, usually my hair has soaked it in and it is not nearly as oily.  I leave it in as long as I can, at least an hour. The smell is noticeable but not unforgiving, and is gone after a shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t linger. Sometimes in the winter I only co-wash with conditioner and it still washes out well. It washes out relatively easily and really helps to repair hair, prevent split ends, and gift it a soft, strong, bouncy texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m natural/chemical-free, but have used this before when I&#x27;ve been both relaxed and texlaxed and the results were consistent. I think it works for all hair types - its just enriched coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;************&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Cocos nucifera oil (COCONUT OIL), HERBAL EXTRACTS [Emblica Officinalis (amla), Fruit Extract Terminalia Chebula Extract, Terminalia belirica extract, azadirahta indica leaf extract, centella asiatica plant extract, hedychium spicatum rhiizone extract, lawsonia inermis leaf extract].

    <li> I love the Vatika oil</li>
    <li> It makes your hair greasy and makes it look wet when its supposed to be dry. It also smells weird</li>
    <li> Not good as I expected! Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair, but I didn&#x27;t like it!</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this oil makes my hair smooth and shiny. It does have a different smell but it goes away.</li>
    <li> I opened the bottle last night which I bought a couple of months back. It&#x27;s dry and solid inside!!!how can I apply this stuff on my hair???</li>
    <li> Received &amp; excited to try it. But couldn&#x27;t get it to come out of the bottle. Put it away for awhile &amp; bought other coconut oil products. I kept seeing this product with 4 or 5 stars. So I knew there was a trick to getting the oil out of the bottle. Have been using my kitchen coconut oil on my hair, but it&#x27;s a little heavy. My hair is fine, curly, very thick &amp; dry. I&#x27;ve kept my hair short all my life because it looks like a dandeline puff-ball if several products to control it are used.&lt;br /&gt;So I looked up the Dabur Vatika coconut oil again &amp; this time I read the reviews very carefully. &amp; voila, someone mentioned that you have to put in warm water or 15 seconds in microwave. Yahoo! Now my hair can be non-dry, shiny, &amp; controlled. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy dark blonde hair, I apply the oil about once a week. If you have very light blonde hair it will leave your hair a little red, that is my only complaint! It tends to get solid on me, so I pop it in the microwave for a few seconds (no more than 10). I apply it to dirty hair before bed, leaving the hair loose. Never had any stains on my cotton pillow cases! A little bit goes a long way! And the sent is a bit strange, I will try the jasmine sent next. Overall the product is amazing! My hair is like silk! Less fall out and less frizz! Plus my scalp is so much healthier, no more Dandruff! Great buy!</li>
    <li> This hair oil is amazing, I try to use it three times a week, and it makes your hair soft, and the shine is amazing, also it helps your hair have less tangles in it! which is always a big plus for me, Also if you give this about a month or a month and a half you will all of a sudden notice a big difference in your hair length, it starts growing fast after that, it did for me. I realize everyone&#x27;s hair is different. I love the fact its full of great ingredients for your hair, and knowing that coconut oil is one of the oils that is proven to actually penetrate the hair shaft, is a Major plus. You should give it a try, especially for the price, you may find out its what your hair has been looking for, and if it&#x27;s not for you, then at least your not out a fortune! and girls you know what I mean; because their is many of products we all purchased for our hair for boo-koo bucks only to find out it didnt work! that&#x27;s a true kick in the gut, I know.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my naturally curly hair. I use it 2x per week as a leave in conditioner. Because my hair is on the dry side, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily at all. In fact, it makes it very shiny with no frizz!</li>
    <li> My first review ever! And I wanted to share how awesome this product is. I bought this product awhile back and still I have the two bottles I bought. It last for a very long time depending on how often you use it. At one point I was using this product 2x a month because it works so well and I see results instantly that I felt I didn&#x27;t need to do it as often. At times I would sleep with it and other times I&#x27;ll leave it in for a few hours either way you&#x27;ll see the results. My hair would feel Healthier and strong and gives it that shiny glow instead of dry and dull. Honestly I was sceptical when reading reviews cause some peoples reviews just sounds like total bulls*** haha but Ive tried most of this products brand and theyve held up to their word about how well the product works. $10.00 best investment on a product that actually helps and do as they say.</li>
    <li> First time purchasing this product, and I love the smell of coconut.  I added it to my Henna mix, and it helped to smooth the hair.  Would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This product is Great!. I use it several times  (3 times) a week. I leave it in for 3 to 4 hours when I am cleaning. Then rinse, shampoo and condition and my hair feels and looks beautiful.  I leave it on my scalp and hair overnight too.  Use of the Dabur Vatika Enriched Coconut Hair Oil alone is enough to heal your scalp if you have dry sensitive scalp or scalp conditions and it also  restores fine, limp hair to healthy, thicker  looking hair. It is truly a wonderful product.  Add a generous amount when you have a few hours.  The product ensures that your hair strands stay moist and healthy always.</li>
    <li> The bottle shipped is not the bottle pictured. The bottle I received has a little plastic \\&quot;cork\\&quot; in the top that reads \\&quot;pierce for use.\\&quot; That does not indicate that the cork should be removed, which is really the case... If you merely pierce it, you have a hole which you then have to squeeze the oil through. Which is fine, I thought, on my first use. It squirts out of the little hole and doesn&#x27;t make too much of a mess. Neat. But, on the 2nd use, the plastic cork popped out and resulted in the bottle exploding all over me and my clothes as well as the entire bathroom. I wasn&#x27;t squeezing extremely hard or anything, but being unfamiliar with this particularly terrible bottle design, I guess I didn&#x27;t squeeze correctly. The plastic \\&quot;cork\\&quot; should just be removed now that I think about it, one hole is never enough; you always need a second hole for air flow physics or else you need a very large hole, i.e. not the sort of hole you can poke in this plastic cork easily... you are going to need some weird poking device for that, something with a sharp point that gets quite large like a pencil if the lead wouldn&#x27;t break out. I looked all around my house for a tool that would poke a large enough hole for this design to make sense and couldn&#x27;t find anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the design of this bottle is garbage. If you have a seal at the end which requires a hole punched out, there should be a warning that the seal is not terribly secure and might just pop out, exploding the orange grease ALL OVER EVERYTHING. Henna does stain and grease is quite hard to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I will order from any one of the other listings here on Amazon. This particular \\&quot;add on\\&quot; vendor who ships through Amazon is showing the wrong bottle.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell that great and I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements with following the directions printed on the bottle.  I have dry, coarse hair with dandruff and was looking to make my flakes go away along with softening my hair.</li>
    <li> This oil makes my hair really silky and soft. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell but whatever I still love the product. I&#x27;ve seen a major growth-spur in my hair!!! I&#x27;am not sure if it&#x27;s because I was on a NO HEAT thing with my hair for about 2 years while I was using this or just the oil it&#x27;s self. Whatever it is-I really like this Vatika Oil.</li>
    <li> Good Product...use 2-3 times per wk. just very hard to get out of bottle, softer plastic needed&amp;#62; Bought for daughter also</li>
    <li> Before I use it, I put the bottle next to the vent of my laptop in order for melting oil.&lt;br /&gt;I leave oil in my hair for all night then wash my hair in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks like silk, my friend said. Good product!&lt;br /&gt;By the way, my hair color is black.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> The product suggests that you apply the oil on and leave it overnight.  Some people suggest that you put it on damp hair after a shower.  I have tried this both and I have found that both ways are good, but I prefer to put it on damp hair and letting my hair dry naturally.  I especially love the smell!  It does still smell a little bit coconut-y but the addition of lemon and rosemary makes it less so.  If I had one complaint about the product, it would be that it does go to \\&quot;sleep\\&quot; if the weather is a little cooler.  I am not sure how nuking it in the microwave affects the quality of the oil after doing so many times.  Otherwise, I love this product!</li>
    <li> Love this oil. I noticed a great deal of growth in my hair once I started using this oil...smell is ok, must be light handed with it, makes my hair feel like cotton...def lighter than EVOO.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works well on my hair as a deep conditioner (in conjunction with another product) and a daily oil. Try it for yourself. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is great. After using it for about a week, my hair feels softer, smoother and it shines like nobodies business. I love it.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Consistancy was a little gritty at first but over a couple of days consistency was oil based as it should be. Love the product don&#x27;t have to use it everyday because my hair is still moisturized and shiny which is excellent because I&#x27;m natural and have 4c hair and that hair type has a problem with holding moisture.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the only brand I&#x27;ll ever purchase wonderful product. It makes the hair and skin nice and moisturized and the price is nice!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing hair oil, that strengthens and grows all hair types.  When used overnight you will see amazing results in the morning.</li>
    <li> I remember my grandmother using Coconut oil on her scalp and hair as well as my mother so when I started flaking for no reason at all, I bought this. Works great before you shower to massage it on your scalp and leave, do not rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue with this product is when temperature goes down. This product hardens. I usually put it in the microwave without the cap for less than a minute. This is actually better to use because you have hot oil in your scalp, just make sure that it&#x27;s not super hot and just warm enough for you.</li>
    <li> I use this for a pre-poo on my natural hair. It makes my hair soft and easy to detangle. I would order it again.</li>
    <li> Product Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 Bottle of Vatika&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice. Contains 100% natural ingredients so there are no fillers, no mineral oil or other substitutes that are chemicals that have creeped into the other line of Vatika products. The coconut turns solid at room-temperature so easiest solution is to warm up the bottle and pour the contents out into a separate container.</li>
    <li> Unexpectedly, the bottle inside unexpectedly is solid state oil...... In fact, I also bought the wrong, was it, put it as shampoo……</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom and my daughter, whose hairs are on the dry side.  Neither them likes it, but they didn&#x27;t tell me because they didn&#x27;t want to hurt me.  When I found out both bottles left in the cabinet, and tried to use them myself, I&#x27;ve found out that they were hardened and solid!  No liquid oil at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never ever buy this if you don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> My mom and wife are very happy with this hair treatment. They use it when they dye their hair with Hannah. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am an African-American woman with natural hair &amp; had read many blogs of \\&quot;naturalistas\\&quot; who praised this product to the skies as an effective pre-poo so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew that the Vatika was a solid product that I&#x27;d need to warm in order for it to liquify so I placed the bottle in a bowl of moderately hot water for about 5 - 10 minutes.  Afterwards I saturated my hair with the oil, finger detangled, sectioned then covered with a conditioning cap for 1+ hour(s).  Next I rinsed the Vatika out of my hair with cool water before co-washing it.  My hair is left feeling super soft &amp; moisturized since I&#x27;ve added the Vatika to my regimen &amp; I love the smell once it&#x27;s warm &amp; liquified - lemony graham crackers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Vatika oil since late August 2012 &amp; although it doesn&#x27;t cover my grays nor change my hair color, I have noticed that I can go longer between color touch-ups. Prior to using this oil, I needed to touch up every 4 weeks but since I started using it I have gone as long as 8 weeks before needing to refresh my color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works well as a moisturizer for my twists &amp; scalp; my hair doesn&#x27;t feel overly moisturized or weighed down and I usually apply it every other night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vatika didn&#x27;t work as a sealant or leave-in for me: it didn&#x27;t seem to work well with the moisturizer I used (Shea Moisture Coconut/Hibiscus Smoothie) and my hair was rather frizzy after a braid-out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with a previous comment that depending upon what you want the Vatika to do within your hair regimen, you may have a positive or negative experience with it and thankfully thus far, my experience has been beyond positive.</li>
    <li> I like the way the oil feels but it does get solid so I have to nuke it to soften it</li>
    <li> I love Dabur Vatika Coconut Hair oil. It smells good and gives my hair a nice glossy look. It is not heavy and does not feel greasy. [[ASIN:B006BA3BAY Dabur Vatika Coconut Hair Oil 150ml, 2 Count]]</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t rave enough about this product! I&#x27;ve always had dry, fine, brittle hair, but after a few uses of this once a week, and I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair! It&#x27;s so smooth, soft, and shiny now. Pair this once a week with a good conditioner, and your hair will thank you.</li>
    <li> Used Organix coconut oil serum, but that costs about $10-$6 for a tiny bottle depending on where I go. Found this, got way more for my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed shine and softness after about 3 days of using it. I think it weighs differently in my hair then Organix, more heavy of an oil. My hair seems more &#x27;spikey&#x27; or &#x27;piecey&#x27;. I use Organix coconut-based mousse as well with this.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it on damp hair, then rub excess product out with a towel. That way it creates just a dusting in my hair - helps with the weight.</li>
    <li> I love using this on my natural curls before I shampoo.  I use a generous amount and allow it to sink it while my hair is bun.  This is a affordable coconut oil and the price can&#x27;t be beat.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is very effective. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it is impossible to get my finger in the bottle when I&#x27;m oiling my ends. It makes my hair very soft and doesn&#x27;t take long to melt when sitting in warm water. I would definitely recommend this to anyone needing moisturized hair. It is affordable and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Very good experience with this hair oil! Makes my hair soft and shiny! I use this a night before taking shower! It definitely does magic and i have started noticing that my hair is growing quickly too!</li>
    <li> Great for oiling hair or hot oil treatments, my hair loves this product. I have 4a hair that is kinky and coily, and this product helped during transitioning and my big chop; A litltle goes a long way depending on thickness and curl pattern.</li>
    <li> I like this coconut oil it provides a nice smell and moisture to your hair without the weighed down look and feel. The only thing I dont like is it does not stay in liquid form, so the bottle they put it in is not good!! It needs to be in a jar. Inorder to get the oil out you will have to heat the bottle and thats to much for me.</li>
    <li> The actual product is a 5, but I had to take a star off for packaging.  I&#x27;ve decide to just heat the product (oil) and pour into an empty moisturizer jar I&#x27;ve recycled.  My hair loves Vatika oil, but the packaging leaves A LOT to be desired.</li>
    <li> smells okay, I love how it makes my hair look and feel</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading that coconut oil was a good natural leave-in conditioner for bi-racial hair.  The package came with two bottles.  When I opened the bottle and tried to squeeze some out, the little round plug on the top of the bottle popped out.  I put it back in and squeezed again and it happened again, so I just let it come out the big hole and that&#x27;s when I figured out why it wasn&#x27;t coming out before.  This stuff is really thick.  Even with the plug out, I had to squeeze really hard to get any out.  I ended up putting it in the microwave for about 45 seconds to make it more like oil.  For comparison, this stuff is the consistency of crisco and when melted is like cooking oil.  I put it on my girls&#x27; hair and it got like crisco again, because their hair was cold and wet.  Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but this is not what I expected.  I will stick to argan and jojoba oil for now.</li>
    <li> My sister recommended this for great moisture and hair growth.  She was given some of this from her mother-in-law, from India and just fell in love!!!!.  We are from a biracial background and the oil is 100% coconut oil, which is great for the hair and does not leave a greasy feeling.  I love this!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore how my hair feels with this coconut hair oil. My hair has never felt softer. I use henna on my hair and it can dry your hair out. I have medium length hair and I put a tiny bit of coconut oil on my hair. The product is in a squeeze bottle and the product is solid. I have had to put the bottle in the microwave to get it out of the bottle and transfer it to a plastic tub with a lid. Once the oil cools it reverts back to solid and no amount of squeezing it going to get  that oil out of the bottle...This needs fixed.</li>
    <li> My hair shines and is softer now that I use Vatika. Just follow the instructions to see the improvement in your hair. Definite good buy.</li>
    <li> I like very much. It made a difference how my hair feels. My hair is now better manageable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thank you.</li>
    <li> 80F or above, the coconut oil won&#x27;t come out.  It&#x27;s a hard&lt;br /&gt;plastic bottle and you can&#x27;t squeeze it, to get anything out!&lt;br /&gt;It solidifies below a certain temp and none will come out!!  A&lt;br /&gt;total waste, unless you heat the bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent delivery, item description was exact, highly recommended.  I been using this product with combination of others for over 3 years.</li>
    <li> I like to use this combined with other oils for my custom made hot oil treatment that I use twice a month.  I also add a bit to my deep conditioning mix.</li>
    <li> When it comes  to this product the directions on the bottle shows great results for the hair and it really helps with scalp problems if any. A little does go a long way (it has a lemony natural smell that I can get use to) and does what exactly it says on the back of the bottle (basically a deep conditoner) for all hair types. Although my natural hair color is  dark brown and this oil changed my hair reddish brown if you continously use it overtime (it contains henna that gradually change hair color over time). I don&#x27;t mind the hair color changed since it&#x27;s not really noticeable with my dark hair compared to someone who might have a bright natural hair color or color treated hair. It really get&#x27;s the job done to get hair healthy again and great delivery/packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Seller and Thanks!</li>
    <li> this stuff is great. has all the great indian oils in it especially henna and it has coconut oil. I do a hot oil treatment once a week this stuff and my hair has a great shine to it.  I definitely recommend adding a hot oil treatment into your weekly regimen. it makes a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a while now as well as the Amla Hair Oil. I can&#x27;t really say that I see any difference. It is great for the skin. It is very oily going on, but quickly soaks in. My problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last long enough on my skin. I have to put this on almost every night to keep from feeling like a crocodile.I guess any kind of lotion you have to constantly repeat. I do like that I can put this on my hands and hair all at the same time. I just don&#x27;t see a difference in my hair, nor do I see my skin any different.</li>
    <li> First time using it, it&#x27;s good for your hair make it soft and manageable and if your hair is curly you would need this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend</li>
    <li> My hair has never been healthier, I swear my hair is even growing back and is now stronger</li>
    <li> Hair comes out silky.</li>
    <li> Arrived really quickly but it is a solid so it won&#x27;t come out and is useless. Will be returning it if I can figure out how. Total disappointment.</li>
    <li> Just tried it tonight. Smells nice and made my hair soft. It is a solid. You have to either squeeze it out or warm it in a bowl of hot water. A lot of the 1 star reviews are because they complained it was solid. It is coconut oil people hahah. I just hope the henna is a small amount and doesn&#x27;t mess with colored hair. It doesn&#x27;t look like a henna mix so I would assume its Ok. There is lemon juice so I would not wear it on your hair during the day if you don&#x27;t want your hair to lighten.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 3 years and love it. I have mutt hair (fine, course and wavy). The product has served me well and smell great too. I also enjoy the smell so much I use on my skin too!</li>
    <li> How do I get it out of the container? It&#x27;s like a hard piece of lard.  I had to stick  a knife in to  scoop it out.</li>
    <li> This oil has a heavy smell.  I use it at night so that the smell evaporates before I leave the house.</li>
    <li> if your an uppity girl, stay away. reading all the one to two star reviews made me sick. it is from India. the country where the women&#x27;s hair is the most prized and sellable product. it is not from America in a crystal blinged out bottle. it is in a recyclable, PRACTICAL use bottle. screw the bottle and design, the hard as a rock product works absolute wonders. ( ever heard of a microwave?) I used to purchase from indo-pak stores but the one nearest me moved. I used this product freshman year when my hair was shoulder length. senior year, my hair is long, lustrous, falls past my butt and envied by every long-hair-loving girl I walk past. Heat it up , squirt product in sections at roots, massage it in, add to length, wrap it up with a bag, and relax for a few hours. wash it out well. and there you go. I believe in this product 100%. I have provided a picture of my hair. (I color my hair black, good for color treated hair.)</li>
    <li> If you sleep with it overnight, be prepared for oily hair for a few days (even if you wash it). However, it does help making your hair look oily. I don&#x27;t care for the smell. I would try other products once I finish this one. I would recommend it for dry scalp. I don&#x27;t have that problem but it was nice on my hubby&#x27;s hair. It is worth a try if you have dry frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I find the scent to be pleasant. Not sickly sweet, or fake chemical fruity/flowery. It emulsifies in my hands quickly and blends well with styling products, or on dry curly hair. The only thing I had not considered was that here in Alaska, it will only be a liquid oil about 2 weeks out of the year. The rest of the time, even our warmer days of 60F are not enough to keep this from remaining solid in the bottle. I popped the dispenser off the top so I can dig a little out. Something to consider if you&#x27;re in the northern region.</li>
    <li> I love coconut oil for my hair, but I have to say, unless you are a dark haired brunette you should not use this. It has henna in it. I didn&#x27;t know this when I purchased it, and I was too afraid to use it because I didn&#x27;t want to damage my highlights (and I guess when you use henna it affects your ability to color as well).</li>
    <li> This stuff comes hard as a rock. I have to stick it in hot water every time I want to use it.</li>
    <li> Package arrived quickly. Due to dry skin issues, tried this product and it has worked well. After applying every third night for two weeks, scalp in much better condition. Previously used coconut oil from a jar, but this is more convenient and has several additional herbal ingrediants. Will purchase more of this product for continued use.</li>
    <li> i love this product every single time I use it! It makes the hair shinny and smooth- I like how its not super oily and sticky unlike other oils and it smells wonderful too</li>
    <li> This oil leaves my hair so soft and it penetrates so fast!  I am overjoyed to have taken a chance on this oil.  One word of caution:  the smell is a bit aggressive at first.  It&#x27;s fine once you put it on; in fact, it&#x27;s fine once you get past the initial suprise.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but very different.  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this ever since I went natural in March and it has help a lot. My hair has never felt and looked so healthy. I just hate the fact that I have to put it in hot water everyday because it thickens overnight.</li>
    <li> I have been using coconut oil on my hair and thought this would be an added bonus with it having additional ingredients.  I feel it works just as well, not better not worse.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT TWO ARR OK BUT ALL THE SAME OIL IS NOT LIQUID BUT SOLID NEED KNIFE TO GET IT OUT OF SQUEEZE BOTTLE THATS A JOKE PLZ RESPOND OR $$ BACK  THNKS GR</li>
    <li> I really cannot do any self expression about this particular product because I cannot access it. It is extremely hard to squeeze it from the bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vatika hair oil for about three months now. I have fine, straight hair. I use it when I color my hair with henna and indigo and I use it along with Brahmi and Neem powders as a conditioning treatment. My hair seems thicker and I have no split ends or damage even though I blow dry and use hot rollers regularly. My hair also has a noticeable shine.</li>
    <li> What a great bargain!!! I loved that I found 2 bottles of this amazing oil for such  a steal. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> it came quick, and it leaves my hair, healthy, smooth, and smells great! You do not need to lose a lot at a time so i will use it for a long time</li>
    <li> I use this once a week. I put the bottle in some hot water to melt the oil. I than saturate my hair with this stuff, focusing on ends. I than clip all my hair back and put a cheap little shower cap over it. I do not sleep in it because I can&#x27;t figure out how to keep the shower cap from slipping off and I do not want a bunch of smelly oil in bed. I do however keep this in my hair for a good 8-10 hours. I do not care for the smell but I can put up with it to get the results. My hair is naturally wavy and tends to frizz easily. Since I have started this once a week, I noticed my waves are more defined and the frizz is going away. I have notice less hair loss and my hair seems to be thicker. Yes, this stuff does bring out the natural red in my hair but I really don&#x27;t mind that. I have actually noticed that I do not have to dye my grays as often since I have been using this, so that&#x27;s pretty awesome. I have chin length thick hair so one bottle gives me about 4-5 treatments.</li>
    <li> After the dyed hair color had been stripped by my hair stylist, my hair was breaking, frizzy, and very unhealthy. I did some research and decided to try this product. After the second use (I wash my hair leave this in for a few hours, then wash it out) my hair has become noticeably  healthier and more manageable.</li>
