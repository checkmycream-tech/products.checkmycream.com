      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something to make my face look more even and to minimize the redness and pores around my nostrils.</li>

      <li>A fantastic product!</li>
      <li>Was shipped two day prime (love prime)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, if you have the money, it&#x27;s a safe buy.</li>
      <li>I love thesw face peels</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing and worth the $$</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy start to an anti-aging regimen.</li>
      <li>I endured pain but didn&#x27;t think that was too strong and wound up with scars.</li>
      <li>However, when I went to a dermatologist for a peal they told me to tell them when it felt too strong.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t like it because it was too strong for my skin.</li>
      <li>The product itself is fine</li>
      <li>/&gt;Dermatologist... This works fine</li>
      <li>Overall a great product.</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t had a pimple in six months I&#x27;ve been using it, and my skin appears luminous and smooth.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
      <li>It is super easy.</li>
      <li>This product does not smell fantastic, does not feel super smooth and does nothing for my skin.</li>
      <li>After only one use I saw an amazing difference!  </li>
      <li>(don&#x27;t need more breakouts thanks!).  </li>
      <li>But the part 2 of application did feel nice on the eyes and has no peeling qualities and is probably safe for such use.</li>
      <li>This is a product I can not live without and so happy to find at this price.  </li>
      <li>The pore treatment quickly reverted to original size.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the extra strength</li>
      <li>I searched top 10 products for helping reduce the appearance of acne scars &amp; this was high on the list.</li>
      <li>I looked on Amazon and was so happy to find it half the price of the retail store</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any change the next day, but on the second day I saw a remarkable improvement!  </li>
      <li>I found that it harmed and made more wrinkly the sensitive eye area.</li>
      <li>Soooo worth it.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>It clears right up.</li>
      <li>After the first night I used it</li>
      <li>It is a two-part application and even when I waited more than two minutes to apply the second application, I did not have any harm or damage.</li>
      <li>I first heard of this product when it was recommended to me by a department store employee.</li>
      <li>I recommend that you try and find samples somewhere first.</li>
      <li>Most regular face washes make me oily.</li>
      <li>Better value, same results.</li>
      <li>It really is a miracle worker (in my case anyways)!</li>
      <li>Really, was not the right face exfoliator for me.</li>
      <li>but because it&#x27;s not pharmaceutical grade it is less effective.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really changing my skin.</li>
      <li>Very upset about that.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s getting there, thanks to these.</li>
      <li>My skin has improved much over the course of this product.</li>
      <li>This peel really brings out the shine on my skin.  </li>
      <li>It really didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
      <li>Even my boyfriend noticed the difference, and he doesn&#x27;t notice much.  </li>
      <li>I really like the way this two step process works.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a 1.5 years and really like it.  </li>
      <li>When my skin is acting up, I clean it and then use these pads.</li>
      <li>First, I have incredibly sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin appear to be brighter and vibrant.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin very soft and really shrinks the pores.  </li>
      <li>They really peeled off my older skins, specially worked on the dark spots.</li>
      <li>it was only right</li>
      <li>I live by this stuff.</li>
      <li>I used the product once a week because I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>more even, less red, clearer.</li>
      <li>I originally was going to purchase this at nordstrom but for half the price</li>
      <li>my skin looks clear and toned.</li>
      <li>The saleswoman assured me it would clear up my skin, tighten my pores and help with aging skin.</li>
      <li>While not a miracle worker, this product is at least a &amp;#34;worker,&amp;#34; unlike so many others.  </li>
      <li>The first week I used them every day, then I used one every other day.</li>
      <li>So you&#x27;ll be out a lot of money and may only see very minimal amount of fresh glowing skin.</li>
      <li>The Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta peal at this level of concentration really doesn&#x27;t seem to change anything long term or with acne</li>
      <li>It not only keeps your complexion clear, it tightens and brightens.</li>
      <li>My skin isn&#x27;t necessarily oily but it is breakout prone, and products designed to make it better often make it worse.</li>
      <li>It does burn a little after the first two or three applications of the product, but it&#x27;s not an unbearable pain</li>
      <li>Less drying than proactive, but has not controlled my breakouts as much as I would like.  </li>
      <li>In the short term regarding pore size, there is a topical but not long term</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Easy start to an anti-aging regimen. Less drying than proactive, but has not controlled my breakouts as much as I would like.  Seems to work better if you use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and worth the $$</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Truly refines your skin.</li>
    <li> I first heard of this product when it was recommended to me by a department store employee. I purchased it hoping to help with my acne prone skin. The saleswoman assured me it would clear up my skin, tighten my pores and help with aging skin. I came home excited to try the product and after a week I was impressed. I looked on Amazon and was so happy to find it half the price of the retail store so I purchased another one. Was shipped two day prime (love prime) and although I have noticed a big difference in the size of my pores and small facial lines, it hasn&#x27;t helped with my problem skin, which is why I gave only 4 stars. Will continue looking for the magic treatment that may solve my breakout issues.</li>
    <li> Really, was not the right face exfoliator for me. It really didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. I used them for three weeks. The first week I used them every day, then I used one every other day. These are VERY expensive. So you&#x27;ll be out a lot of money and may only see very minimal amount of fresh glowing skin. I recommend that you try and find samples somewhere first. Perhaps Sephora can help or contacting Dr Dennis Gross company.</li>
    <li> This is a product I can not live without and so happy to find at this price.  I will definitely use this vendor again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure how to review this product so I&#x27;ll write this with two comparisons... dermatologist peals and at home peals. I purchased the 60 treatment package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dermatologist... This works fine but because it&#x27;s not pharmaceutical grade it is less effective. However, when I went to a dermatologist for a peal they told me to tell them when it felt too strong. I endured pain but didn&#x27;t think that was too strong and wound up with scars. This product will not leave you with any scars. It is a two-part application and even when I waited more than two minutes to apply the second application, I did not have any harm or damage. I would not recommend using this around the eye area. The directions also discourage this. I found that it harmed and made more wrinkly the sensitive eye area. But the part 2 of application did feel nice on the eyes and has no peeling qualities and is probably safe for such use. I&#x27;m not a dermatologist so do find your own information on the part two of the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Home peals... I did notice some pore minimalization, but only after each use. There was no noticeable scar minimalization at all. The pore treatment quickly reverted to original size. I used this product every day and it minimized pores when I did that. It did nothing for scar or evening skin tone at all regardless of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you have the money, it&#x27;s a safe buy. Use it every day and perhaps you will see a long term difference. In the short term regarding pore size, there is a topical but not long term effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you have an above average dermatologist and have the money for that, follow that path. The Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta peal at this level of concentration really doesn&#x27;t seem to change anything long term or with acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps. xoxo</li>
    <li> I live by this stuff. It not only keeps your complexion clear, it tightens and brightens.</li>
    <li> I would reorder.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love this!  It makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this when I ordered something from Sephora and loved it so I hurried to Amazon to order the 30 pack.  It makes my skin very soft and really shrinks the pores.  Also a brown spot I had on my cheek is fading.</li>
    <li> Great! My skin has improved much over the course of this product.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! I love this stuff. It&#x27;s really changing my skin. I suffer from acne and it&#x27;s getting rid of my dark spots one day at a time. Soooo worth it. I originally was going to purchase this at nordstrom but for half the price it was only right I bought it from here. (:</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference, but I&#x27;ll continue to use 2x a week</li>
    <li> Not as good as the extra strength</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Great results!</li>
    <li> This product is phenomenal!  I had a ton of breakouts in my teen years, and being only 22 now, I&#x27;m left with a lot of noticeable scars, uneven skin surface, and hyperpigmentation.  After only one use I saw an amazing difference!  After the first night I used it I didn&#x27;t notice any change the next day, but on the second day I saw a remarkable improvement!  It does burn a little after the first two or three applications of the product, but it&#x27;s not an unbearable pain and it doesn&#x27;t happen anymore and I&#x27;m only on my fifth use.  I used the product once a week because I have very sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t want to risk irritating it (don&#x27;t need more breakouts thanks!).  Even my boyfriend noticed the difference, and he doesn&#x27;t notice much.  I would recommend this to anyone unhappy with their skin!  It really is a miracle worker (in my case anyways)!</li>
    <li> Awesome product but the price has doubled since I first purchased. Its not worth that much and how irritating -- makes me feel abused and manipulated as a customer.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money! This product does not smell fantastic, does not feel super smooth and does nothing for my skin. I am greatly disappointed. If at all then it irritated my skin in the area under my mouth. I had to stop using it after 2 weeks because I got a rash. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use. Visible results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in awe of these things. First, I have incredibly sensitive skin. Getting a facial makes my skin angry for weeks. Scrubs dry me out. Most regular face washes make me oily. My skin is temperamental and bipolar. I was looking for something to make my face look more even and to minimize the redness and pores around my nostrils. I finally found it in these peels. I feel like these are magic! My pore are less visible, skin tone more even, less red, clearer. I&#x27;ve had people tell me my skin is flawless- and it&#x27;s getting there, thanks to these. They don&#x27;t burn. I use them once every 3-4 days. On the other days I use Origins Checks and Balance foam wash. I moisturize after the peels, if I&#x27;m gonna be in the sun. Usually, I use them before bed, and that&#x27;s all I have to use for my face. I use the ones that aren&#x27;t extra strength, don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessary. I don&#x27;t have acne or pimples, though.</li>
    <li> A fantastic product! When my skin is acting up, I clean it and then use these pads. It clears right up. I used them on a daily basis for a couple weeks before my wedding and my skin was glowing!</li>
    <li> These are amazing. My skin flakes in the winter and after one use the flakiness went away. If you don&#x27;t think they work, use it on only half your face and see if you notice a difference even while you&#x27;re doing it. Life changing, seriously. Like another reviewer, I cut them in half to get double the use and I find I don&#x27;t need them everyday. I&#x27;ll do two days and then skip a day. Better value, same results.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine but I had an issue with freshness of it.  For an expensive product I have already had to discard 3 of the packets.  Two of them were completely dried out and one had leaked and the packet was stained orange.  Very upset about that.</li>
    <li> Good, but u must continue to use it to see improvement.  Also expensive too.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when I purchased this. This was one of the more expensive skin care products I have purchased. It met all my expectations. I use it every evening. My slwas make up off then apply then pads. It is super easy. Since starting my skin is smoother and my pores are noticeably smoother. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This will change your life!!! Get ready for beautiful skin!</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble with my skin, but after using this product it is almost completely clear! my red marks that i have always had from past acne are almost cleared up. I would definitely  recommend this product !</li>
    <li> The best exfoliator I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I really like the way this two step process works. It makes my skin appear to be brighter and vibrant. While it does reduce dullness, it does not seem to fade age spots. I&#x27;ll just have to find something else to help with that.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  Product does make my face feel cleaner but thats about it!</li>
    <li> While not a miracle worker, this product is at least a &amp;#34;worker,&amp;#34; unlike so many others.  Makes skin a bit smoother, and breakouts are reduced.</li>
    <li> They really peeled off my older skins, specially worked on the dark spots.</li>
    <li> works well. my skin looks clear and toned. the price makes it difficult to use daily, so I cut them in half and use every other day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why everyone is raving about this. It does nothing to me.</li>
    <li> I searched top 10 products for helping reduce the appearance of acne scars &amp; this was high on the list. I have been using this product at least every 3 days over the past month &amp; have seen changes that I thought I&#x27;d never see. I have been using this product along with other products (rotating them every few days). The immediate reaction is similar to a chemical peel, but not as severe, but you can feel the tingling sensation, which lets you know it&#x27;s working. I will be buying more of this product once I run out of the box I have!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this on a spa trip and I have been hooked. It reduced the dark spots, made my skin brighter and reduced my pore size. It&#x27;s expensive but I notice a change when I don&#x27;t use it. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love thesw face peels but when I recieved them one or two were open or went bad so that was very dissapointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this peel for years.  I do not use it daily though.  I only use it when my skin looks dull, so maybe once or twice a month.  This peel really brings out the shine on my skin.  It removes the dead skin effortlessly.  No scrubbing.  I tried the extra strength formula once but I didn&#x27;t like it because it was too strong for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a 1.5 years and really like it.  I use it one day a week, but may increase to twice a week.</li>
    <li> When I started using this product my skin wasn&#x27;t horrible, but I had my issues with it. I always had a small pimple somewhere, and each blemish left me with an ugly dark mark that could take up to a year to fade. This peel is miraculous. haven&#x27;t had a pimple in six months I&#x27;ve been using it, and my skin appears luminous and smooth. My skin isn&#x27;t necessarily oily but it is breakout prone, and products designed to make it better often make it worse. I have spent countless hours researching and trying products to cure my skin woes, and nothing I&#x27;ve tried compares to this peel.  The downsides are minimal - It&#x27;s definitely on the pricey side, and it hasn&#x27;t touched my blackheads. Overall a great product.</li>
