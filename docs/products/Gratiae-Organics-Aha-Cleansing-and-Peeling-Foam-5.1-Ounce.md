<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product, I baght it for the second time, its perfect!!!</li>
    <li> Great skin care , but this order , the products were cloudy and not normal . Keeps your skin glowing . Apply after cleaning</li>
    <li> Love this product! Keeps my face clean and great eye makeup remover - instantly works. Pump is Ok - it was better on the same cleanser in the past but less foam this time. Still a great cleanser. I get roseaca and this is mild and keeps the breakouts in check.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pushing 49 years old and constantly have break-outs, this works better than many, many other products I&#x27;ve tried.  It does seem to help clear up my skin faster than other products and I love a foam cleanser.  I also feel it does help to control my very oily skin, it&#x27;s not completely oil-free but it is better.  I&#x27;m not sure I recommend this product, I will continue to use and see how it goes as I bought my first bottle in early July so I&#x27;m only about 7 weeks in.  Hope this helps!!!!</li>
    <li> last forever !&lt;br /&gt;It can be a tad drying if you use to much.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is on the oily side. It also removes makeup great.</li>
    <li> I started using this face wash in August of 2011 and I love it. It does a great job at cleaning my face without drying it out. The wash itself is smooth and velvety to the touch as you cleanse your face. All in all a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure the the peeling foam, but I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product and how it makes my face feel.  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do - cleans very well and does peel your skin.  I have mature dry skin - so, too drying for me.  But on younger skin, should do well.</li>
    <li> When I found this product I was looking for something to help with consistent break outs. I have tried everything from Proactive to Clinique to bring my skin back to life. Within the first week of using this my skin improved tremendously and I haven&#x27;t had a break out since. My sister is getting married in a month and calls this a life saver! We use it morning and night with a moisturizer and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser!</li>
    <li> WOW - UP&#x27;D THE PRICE TO MORE THAN THE SERUMS.  I&#x27;M SO NOT HAPPY.  Good cleanser,  not oily, a little goes a long way  I use this once a day in the morning. I feel it would be too drying if I used it twice a day.  It is not to go on your eyes.  It makes my face feel fresh and clean and not dry. A good start for my day! I&#x27;m happy to see this back on amazon to purchase. I think this company&#x27;s gone out of business,  or has reinvented themselves with a new company name .  I initially was ripped off at the mall at one of those carts purchasing several of these products by that company.  The One product I decided I liked and wanted again is this cleanser!</li>
    <li> Very good product for facial cleaner. Prompt service in the delivery of it.</li>
    <li> Make my face feel clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Iwas so happy to find my favorite Gratiae facial cleanser at Face,Etc. I could not find it any other place. It was also a reasonable price. I stocked up on it. First purchase of it was on streets of Las Vegas at a HUGE price but I grew to love it so happy to find it.</li>
    <li> This is the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. It is cleansing, not drying. Leaves my skin feeling healthy, and not so oily.</li>
    <li> Great product. It leaves my skin glowing and radiant. It last for months at a time. It&#x27;s a a must buy.</li>
    <li> Love the way this cleans.</li>
    <li> Makes my face so soft after using, foams up nicely and smells good.  Makes me wash my face as often as I should.</li>
    <li> Best cleanser I have ever used, and it&#x27;s not even close. Believe me when I say I&#x27;ve tried literally dozens of products. All the good reviews on here are accurate, ladies!</li>
    <li> After getting stung in Las Vegas, I have to wonder why I can buy it online from numerous vendors for so much less. I did manage to get the cute Italian guy selling it to throw in quite a few extras for free so I didn&#x27;t feel too ripped off though.</li>
    <li> This cleanser does what it says. But is is not a very strong exfoliator. I prefer the fruit acid peels over AHA cleansers. But I love Gratiae I just dont prefer this cleanser over vivo per lei. I still use it though and it can overdry your face a little</li>
    <li> I could feel a difference in my skin after first use. After a week, red areas looked much better. I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have never been one to spend a lot of money on skin care. This product is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This is a great cleansing foam which really exfoliates naturally without irritation. It also smells great and I felt as though I had a spa-like experience. If you are someone who likes to take care of your skin, then this product is for you. I would definitely re-purchase this foam.</li>
    <li> Gratiae Organics are amazing products. My skin type is oily and it is very difficult for me to find facial skin products that can counter act the excessive facial oil in my face, with these products I am able to do this with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gratiae Organics Cleansing and Peeling Foam is amazing it is smooth and creates a rich lather that distributes properly on the surface of your face. I love it because it does not contain any oils and has a pleasant scent. After I use this product my skin feels smooth,clean and has no traces of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gratiae Organics Facial Toner is also oil free and leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed for my daily facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both products are true to size and come neatly sealed in a plastic wrapper to prevent spills shipping is fast. Loved the product.</li>
    <li> I really like the soap cleanser. I tried it at the kiosk and also bought it there. Gladly I found it even cheaper here. Delivery to Europe was no problem at all and really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to the product itself: I love it, it smells sooo good and i feel refreshed after cleansing my face. The only reason why i only gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because it says \\&quot;Cleansing and Peeling Foam\\&quot; but i don&#x27;t get the peeling effect?! In my opinion it is \\&quot;only\\&quot; a cleanser - but a really damn good one.</li>
    <li> Bought at kiosk in las Vegas.  Loved it the fist time I used it.  My face was so dry and  flaky.  After 1 time, very smooth.  I had tried a prescription cream, but didn&#x27;t work.  Will always use this.  Smells so nice and a dime size will wash your entire face.  Much cheaper on amazon.</li>
    <li> I Love this product , but the original one . This definitely fake . The smell, the thickness and most important is after washing feeling ... It doesnt have the silky ness that most of original gratiae have. I can not believe people do make fake cosmetics/ skin creams</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve sampled other Gratiae products before, and they all have their individual charms, but this is my favorite.  It&#x27;s light enough to use daily, and in 2-3 days it already had really cleaned out and shrunken my pores, leaving my skin super soft and smooth.  This is one of their best secrets, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I suffer from rosacea and most products irritate me and make my face go red like a ripe tomato.  I was impressed to see the redness go away after washing my face.  The whole product line is great.  I was introduced to it in Paris Hotel, Las Vegas and paid $100 for the moisturizer.  When I saw them in Amazon for a portion of the price, I bought the rest of the products and love all of them.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face feeling clean and does not dry my face.  All you need are 1 or 2 pumps.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I used many different cleansing but this is best of bests cause when I touch my face feel so soft and clean..I recommanded my friends about it..so good. and price is make me so happy too^^</li>
    <li> I use this along with the gratiae scrub cleanser and the Cleansing Lotion. I have a regimen I use - the lotion cleanser every morning, the scrub cleanser two times a week and this one a few times a week. My skin is oily and all the products feel great on my skin and do not make it oily. In fact my face is less oily and more balanced since using these products. A little of this goes a long way. If you pust the pump half way that usually is a perfect amount for face and neck and chest area. It smells good and highly recommend it. It will make you peel, I used it for about two weeks everyday when I first got it and I did peel but once that stopped my skin looks the best it has.</li>
    <li> Skin felt clean and refreshed I like the form it wasn&#x27;t too harsh or drying to the skin.  Good product</li>
    <li> I just love this cleanser. Just a very little goes a long way; it is fresh and light leaving absolutely no residue or anything at all on your face. I have other products from this line and will stay with them.</li>
    <li> Found your website and was elated to find the products at such good prices after my daughter and I were robbed  at a local Gratiae  store in Perimeter Mall in Atlanta. We needed to practically take out a loan for the products we bought there. Thank you so much for the great values.</li>
    <li> Love it.........Nothing like it. Makes your face feel good and clean, smells good too.&lt;br /&gt;All there products are vey good. I was in Vagas and they got me hoked on this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year,  wroth every dine. I&#x27;m over fifty years old, I look like I&#x27;m in my thirty&#x27;s, Because of same type of product in this line.</li>
    <li> Thank you - Amazon for the order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It make my skin feel so soft and  Anti-Wrinkle Lifting Moisturizer Cream, and Replenishing Eye Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> SHE LOVED THE PRICING AND QUICK DELVERY</li>
    <li> I like the product but I don&#x27;t understand why it is called a peel unless I am using it wrong.</li>
    <li> The best face wash I have used by far.  I ahve used Obagi and a Clarisonic brush for years.  I now use this wash in the am and my Clarisonic with mild face wash in the evening.  I have suffered from adult acne for most of my adult life, with this combination it is now under control.</li>
    <li> Ever since I received this as a gift a year ago,  have used nothing else. It works great! I received it faster than I was told too!</li>
    <li> awesome!! I totally love it!! It makes my skin feel so clean without drying it out and I can use it twice a day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the minority here it looks like but I didn&#x27;t care for this cleanser at all. It didn&#x27;t foam as much as I would have liked, but that&#x27;s ok had it removed my makeup, which is primarily why I use a cleanser at night to begin with. Followed up with the Gratiae toner (which I like a lot) and there was all kinds of makeup on the cotton pad. Too bad because the cleanser does smell nice and didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all, which is why I gave it two stars. Gave it to my mom so it wouldn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
    <li> This was a little to drying for my skin, but excellant for my teenager. She loved it and wouldn&#x27;t be with out it now that she has tried it. Can&#x27;t beat Amazons prices anywhere!</li>
