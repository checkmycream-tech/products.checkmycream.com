<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Just found out about this product last week,  just in time for my wife&#x27;s birthday. It arrived promptly, and was the first gift she opened, and immediately loved it upon trying it this weekend on her hair, and skin~As we learn more about the usage, we can&#x27;t wait to try it again, &amp; again!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have resorted to using more natural products, this was such an awesome product to use not just on my skin but my hair as well.</li>
    <li> Argan oil is amazing. I use it from head to toe.</li>
    <li> Great oil.  I have kinky-curly, thick, coarse hair and this oil made my hair soft. There wasn&#x27;t a smell to this so I could use it with other hair products. I also used this oil on my face and chest area, without any breakouts. I went to purchase more, but amazon says it doesn&#x27;t know if this will ever be in stock again.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It easily gets absorbed and doesn&#x27;t make me hair and skin too oily. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Anyone who lives in a humid climate knows how difficult it can be to tame your hair.  I have thick, coarse, wavy hair with a mind of its own plus I live in a hot and humid climate.  I use a little of this oil on damp hair as part of my hair care routine and it has helped control the frizziness.  The smell is different from other argan oil brands I have used but it is not unpleasant.  I would purchase this product again.  The price is right for the quality and the way it has helped free me from multiple &amp;#34;bun days&amp;#34; makes me recommend this oil to my friends.</li>
    <li> I was using it for my hair and wasn&#x27;t extremely impressed.  I started to actually use this on my nails.. to remove waterproof makeup and to use it on my eyelashes and also my eyebrows.  I never thought about using it for anything other than my hair but I also have been using it in addition to my deep conditioning that I do for my hair once a week.  You would be amazed at what the things you can do with argan oil.  It&#x27;s improved my nails and I am more than happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this again along with the jojoba oil.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful.  The product has no smell, non greasy, absolutely clean and the dropper allows you to put just the right amount on.  I use  this mainly on my hands after working in the barns.  My fingers tend to crack at the tips from being wet and cold.  The Argan oil is the first product that allow my fingers to heal.  I love it.  I also use it on my face and neck as a moisturizer...wonderful!</li>
    <li> Best oil ever! I use this on my face and my hair/scalp. My face has been smooth and supple 12hrs later after applied. My hair looks healthier and shiny. There&#x27;s no smell that I notice from the oil, which I like and can be used as a carrier for essential oils. The bottle and dropper are glass and work well. I will definitely be ordering this again when I start to get low.</li>
    <li> This is the best Argon oil! I have highlights and this is the only thing that made a difference. My hair looks and feels healthy and shiny without the greaseness and weighed down look. Don&#x27;t hesitate, BUY it!</li>
    <li> The directions are correct, you only need a few drops to restore manageability to your hair. I love the recover my hair is making, less breakage after only using this version of argan oil after two uses.&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin, namely, dry, cracked heels, give this a try and again, apply a small amount, it goes along way.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it is supposed to! Helps me out everyday when I need it. Better than other argan oils, aight!?</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife because she has been using argan oil products for years now. She was happy with the quality of this new brand. She says it keeps her mane well nourished and frizz free, not oily as some other brands. Also, it can be used for skin care, which she was really happy with; especially because it did wonders for her hands.</li>
    <li> Work great after shower and before bed, feel like natural body oil.</li>
    <li> Best oil ever ! I love you Leven Rose!! My skin as well!</li>
    <li> There customer service is the best!! Fast reply to any questions I use Argan oil for my  scalp. I have used different types of Argan oil and this is one of my favorites. It is not sticky and it is odorless which makes it awesome. The price is great for the value. I would definitely purchase it product again.</li>
    <li> I normally purchase Argon oil from the health food store and spend a great amount of money on it. I&#x27;ve never purchased online before so I decided to try it. BOY AM I PLEASED!!!! The QUALITY of this product and the QUANTITY of this product for the REASONABLE price is just awesome!!! For one who utilizes this product daily for my face and also for my hair regimen, I am one satisfied customer!! I will definitely be purchasing again real soon!!!</li>
    <li> Exceptional value and a really wonderful product. I enjoy using it on my hands, face - and ends of hair.</li>
    <li> works awesome! I am a person with fairly dry hair and this takes care of it and leaves it so soft and healthy feeling and looking and without the smell that all the other brands have.</li>
    <li> I luv this product. I have been using it for hair and it has transformed my hair for good. I will buy this product for life!</li>
    <li> Love Leven Rose oils! I got the Jojoba oil and it top quality and and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great price, great product.  I think the Argan Oil is the lightest of all oils.  I have partially oily skin on my facial area, and this oil does not add to the natural oils in my skin.  It makes my skin feel really soft, especially the parts of my face that Peri-menopause caused dry patches.  This is a wonderful oil that I would recommend to my family and friends. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this oil!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of weeks now, and I am quite impressed. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to see notable differences, but my hair feels more manageable now. I&#x27;ve also started to use it on dry skin, and it does help. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and I recently purchased this product to use to tame frizz. I wanted a natural product, without a ton of harsh ingredients. It work GREAT! I just apply the oil to my damp hair, scrunch, and let air dry. My curls are frizz-free, shiny, (and best of all) SOFT! No more crunchy hair! All my life i have been trying different products to find one that would tame frizz without the \\&quot;crunch\\&quot; and i think i have finally found it. I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I have ordered Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil from a home shopping network, and this is just as good and it&#x27;s half the price!! I will come back for more when I run out!</li>
    <li> I love putting this on my skin and hair and it works just the same as the more expensive brands. You can not beat the price and I will defiantly be ordering again and again.</li>
    <li> My skin si now soooo soft! Thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> Costumer service was awesome. I use this for my hair only on my ends. Makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing. i love how it doesnt have any chemicals or perfumes in it so that you can use it as lip balm too. I&#x27;m using it for my daughters wavy hair, and my own hair. finally found a perfect product for both of us! we plan to buy more...</li>
    <li> It shipped super fast &amp; I tried it on my hair&lt;br /&gt;Day1:  Applied a few drops to my hair - love it !!, Also applied to my face to moisturize the skip under the makeup, feels good ... I want to try this for acne on my face and see if it helps ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I will definitely  come back again and review this after a few days ...</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this argan oil. The price was great and the customer service is amazing. I like to use it on my face and a couple of drops to smooth my hair down. Works great.</li>
    <li> I was blown away by this product!  It made my overprocessed hair shiny and not greasy at all.  And its 100% pure and organic. Nothing can beat that!</li>
    <li> The merchant contacted me with a brief email to be sure I received the item and was satisfied.  Never asked for a review or even seemed to be fishing.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I have used pure Argan oil.  I&#x27;ve used many products that contained Argaon oil and love them, so gave this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at first that the oil doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell.  I guess all of my products with Argan have a lot of fragrance.  It was a bit off putting a AT FIRST.  I&#x27;m used to it and just as the oil seems to melt into your skin the smell fades or other products overwhelm it.  I don&#x27;t mind at all.  If it is your first time using pure Argon oil, be prepared that it may have an unexpected smell.&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned this to the seller and was immediately offered a refund.  I refused, I wanted to use it longer for a fair judgement.  Glad I did.  I love the product and am used to the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Note--I have very sensitive, dry, skin and am plagued with eczema.  It is a great moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil. It is great on my dry skin and wonderful in homemade bathscrubs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan oil for about 2-3 years now, and I&#x27;ve tried different manufacturers. I like this one and another one the best, they seem to be consistent with each other in terms of scent and thickness. There are a lot of fakes out there, so if you find something that works, stick with it! From the same company I also have the jojoba and rosehip oil, and I&#x27;m happy with those as well, so I trust them with their product. I use the oils in a water spray bottle after I brush my hair, to help the curls form back up, and I also mix in with my body lotion and facial cream. My skin is super soft and my split ends appear only every 5 months now!</li>
    <li> I used this product on my very dry and brittle hair and within days it was softer and healthier looking. I even bought their bead oil for my Husband and he loves it. It makes his beard look glorious.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve used it as the base of a serum that I make and it&#x27;s amazing. I have so many people complementing me on my skin all the time. The company is great too. They take the time to write to customers to make sure they are satisfied with the product. I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this oil and will continue purchasing from this company. Love it!</li>
    <li> Customer service is very good...I have very curly frizzy hair when apply it looks shiny and control frizz for an hour..but it&#x27;s very good for my face..</li>
    <li> I am always bouncing between using coconut oil or biosilk for my hair in addition to the occasional mud treatment. My hair is very curly and frizzy, and can often get very dry, but just a few drops of this product with a little bit of biosilk and all of my friends have noticed the difference. Very happy with the results. My hair looks healthy and shines beautifully.</li>
    <li> I ordered both the Argan Oil and the Jojoba Oil. Both oils are nice and fresh, the price is right, shipping is fast, and the customer service is the best I&#x27;ve experienced.  I just ordered 4 more bottles so I can slather this stuff everywhere!</li>
    <li> I received the Leven Rose oil this weekend from Amazon and there was an insert that came with the bottle.  It said to go to their web address LevenRose.com/freejojo, fill out form or send email and I would receive a free travel-size bottle.  The problem is that the web address they gave me would not come up.  Anyone else have this problem?</li>
    <li> Feels AMAZING. I have psoriasis and eczema, so my skin is very sensitive and also very dry. I have had no problems with this. I can really tell this is top quality. My skin is felling lusciously hydrated, not oily. I will absolutely buy again and have already ordered Leven Rose JoJoba oil.</li>
    <li> Disappoint. No production or expiry dates anywhere, to assure users of potency of ingredients within, or effectiveness (usability). Argan Oil in particular has short life span in terms of effectiveness, after which it becomes rancid, worthless, non-usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated to (4) stars - from 2 - after receiving helpful response from seller.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. Is a dry oil so I use it in the ends of my hair and it never feels greasy. I&#x27;ve also used it for cleansing and moisturizing my face</li>
    <li> Great price and really works! Using it for my toddler&#x27;s eczema on her cheeks and it does the trick! Tried steriod cream, eczema cream, etc, but this is the fastest most effective and healthy way to eliminate her eczema. I just apply 1 or 2 times a day on the area and within 24-48 hours, it&#x27;s gone! I was using the more expensive brand, since I had a small sample bottle of the Josie Maran, but there was no way I could afford using that brand continously....so I found this one and never looked back. Now I use it for my daughter and myself. Thanks Leven Rose for a quality product and an affordable price! Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Leven Rose&#x27;s 100% pure Moroccan Argan Oil (4 oz) is a really nice product. For those who plan to use the oil on hair and skin, the 4 oz. size is the perfect size. It contains only 100% cold pressed, unrefined oil, no additives or significant fragrance are added. The viscosity is like a baby oil, so it quickly absorbed and distributed over hair or skin. The medicine dropper / bottle cap makes it easier to disperse the desired amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smooth the oil onto my hair (long, coarse and dry) before using styling tools, and as a finishing product. After days in the sun, it protects and heals skin on my toes and fingertips; summertime mani-pedis are preserved and appear sandal ready, at all times! It also sped up healing time, after my lips were super dried out by the wind, sun, and lack of lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend for the reasons listed, but also the company seem really interested in meeting their customer&#x27;s needs and hearing their opinion. There are so many great deals and excellent options for this type of product, especially on Amazon. But, what will make me become a repeat customer is Leven Rose&#x27;s interest in their customers. I think that&#x27;s great-- plus, the Argan Oil has quickly become a staple in my household.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I just use 2-3 drops and put in my wet hair before I blow dry. My hair super moisturized and I no longer need to use an anti-frizz serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, something fishy seems to be going on with reviews on this product. All 4-5 star reviews are getting &amp;#34;not helpful&amp;#34; votes.  It seems that there&#x27;s someone out there attempting to disqualify the good reviews on this product for some reason. Weird.</li>
    <li> Mmmm 100% Argan oil? I am not sure about the quality. Bottle said it&#x27;a 100% Pure Virgin Cold Pressed Moroccan Argan Oil though, it doesn&#x27;t say where it&#x27;s made.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3 different Argan oil from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This product is the most inexpensive one (it was on sale $20 for 4oz) and the most thinner liquid. Other Argan oil feels more thicker liquid and smell differently.&lt;br /&gt;This Argan oil makes my skin dryer. But other brands Argan oil doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one: http://www.amazon.com/Virgin-Argan-Premium-Quality-Organic/dp/B00GMAWI66/ref&#x3D;cm_cr-mr-title and this one was the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to buy USDA certified Argan oil. So you know it&#x27;s legit 100% Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;**FYI: There are lots of Made in China - Argan oil in the market these days, they mix with other oil but sells as 100% Argan oil. I am not saying this product is the one of them though.</li>
    <li> my first time using argan oil. i had damaged my hair due to a color treatment and it worked great in helping it repair the damage.  i used it over night and it helped a lot.  i would definitely by this product again.</li>
    <li> I like to wash my hair every few days, but I can&#x27;t do that with this product because it ends up causing my hair to smell odd after a few days.  The bottle has also taken to not shutting properly.  I think the oil is going to spoil before I use it all up.  I tried it on a whim because of the price, and I&#x27;m going to go back to the expensive salon mixture when this is empty (if not sooner).  It doesn&#x27;t give my hair the softness or manageability that I have with Moroccanoil.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Argan oil from Leven Rose for my wife and she absolutely loves it. There has been tremendous improvement in the hair fall condition and has reduced a lot. Thanks a lot for this great product.</li>
    <li> This bottle is larger than expected, and the dark glass will help ensure fresher product for longer. The backs of my hands were so dry when I got this in the mail, I immediately put one drop on the back of each hand and rubbed them together. It absorbed right in and my hands looked and felt soft and smooth again. Normally I would just use this on my hair, but it&#x27;s multi-purpose from now on.</li>
    <li> I like that the oil actually works. It  has a very light nutty smell which dissipates after you put it on. It is a all natural product that has no additives and is good for my hair and skin. Thanks again !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use in my hair before blow drying/flat ironing/curling. I&#x27;ve used other Argan products that really help combat the frizz and keep my hair from looking too dry. First of all the oil is extremely thick and does not absorb into my hair.  I&#x27;ve used this product a few times now, only using a few drops and avoiding my root, but it still makes me hair look soooo greasy that I&#x27;ve actually had to use dry shampoo to help absorb the all of the oil and even then it still looks greasy. I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t pay full price for this product and will no longer use it in my hair, but perhaps on my skin instead so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that the company e-mailed me directly asking how I was liking the product. I responded with an honest opinion, however, I was disappointed to receive this: &amp;#34;Thanks so much for your feedback and I&#x27;m sorry it&#x27;s not working out for you. Have a good night.&amp;#34;  Working in the retail industry, whenever I encounter a less than satisfied customer, I do everything in my ability to make it better so being brushed off like that really didn&#x27;t appeal to me.</li>
    <li> I was primarily drawn to this jojoba oil because of the bottle.  (Not sure why Amazon is linking my review to the Argan oil.)  All the other sellers of similar products used plastic bottles.  I&#x27;m more comfortable storing this in my medicine cabinet than I am the clear plastic bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil cam on time (thanks to Prime).  To my surprise, not only was the bottle made of glass, but the dropper was also.  Otherwise, the oil is great.  I used it to make some beard balm to tame my unruly mane.  My wife plans to use this as a carrier oil for some other facial/hair treatments with an assortment of essential oils.  I&#x27;ve used it directly on my skin and hair as well and it dries in place nicely, without an excessively oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One recommendation I would make on the packaging would be to include measurements on the dropper.  Lots of recipes call for measures of base oils in teaspoons or milliliters.  It would be easier to be able to measure them in the dropper, rather than having to transfer them to multiple other measuring devices.  That being said, the dropper is a nice, larger dropper.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t compare this argan oil to any other brand because this is the first time I have ever used argan oil. I bought it because it is organic and because there&#x27;s nothing else added to it - it&#x27;s pure - just what I was looking for. Since opening the bottle I have used it for my face and body serums as well as on my hair. I love this stuff and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this Argan Oil makes such a big difference in my hair, but it does. My hair isn&#x27;t that hard to manage, but am always looking for something to try. I have had this for about a week now, and I can&#x27;t believe how many compliments I have had. Friends keep thinking I went to the salon today, because my hair is smooth and silky looking. Its super simple to apply. I just put a little in my hair after getting out of the shower, and then combing and drying it is a breeze. I don&#x27; get any tangles, and the oil protects my hair from the hair dryer, leaving a nice professional look and feel. I have even started using some on my cuticles to keep my cuticles soft, and nails healthy. So glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my hair, hoping to make it shinier and less brittle. But if I use too little I don&#x27;t see much effect, &amp; if I use it too much my hair looks too greasy. Still trying to figure out if I&#x27;m using it incorrectly.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!!! I&#x27;d tried other argan oils and they would just sit on my face and it would look greasy under my makeup. When I started using this one, I noticed right away that it actually absorbed into my skin so by the time I wake up in the morning or get ready to do my makeup, it&#x27;s already been mostly absorbed. I love it! Definitely going to be a returning customer!  :)</li>
    <li> I replaced it with my daily moisturizer, and so far it has been great. My skin is soft and blemish-free. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, just a few drops. I suggest using it at night before bed because it takes a while to soak in all the way, and I doubt you would want to walk around with a greasy-looking face all day. I also use Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vinegar diluted with water as a toner in the mornings, which I also highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great for my hair. Don&#x27;t put too much because it will leave your hair too oily.</li>
    <li> Why did you raise the price from $14.00 to $68.00. I was going to try your argan oil because I love the jojoba oil. But when I came back to purchase the argan, levenrose raised the price outrageous. If I&#x27;m going to spend this kind of money, I&#x27;m going with Josie Maran. I know her argan oil is awesome. Not going to take a chance on something I haven&#x27;t tried for this money. Bad form if you ask me.</li>
    <li> This is a very heavy oil.  I have long thick hair and I regularly use a hair dryer and flat iron.  One dime sized amount is as much as I put on.  I start at the ends of my hair and work up, otherwise it is heavy and will weigh my hair down.  I also do use it at night a couple of times a week, leaving it on overnight and washing it out in the morning, which seems to help make my hair softer and more manageable.</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling and looking too oily.</li>
    <li> I have been using argan oils for hair and skin for years, I couldn&#x27;t  be happier! :)</li>
    <li> Level Rose makes such great quality products!</li>
    <li> Ok I have used several oils on mine and my families hair. This is better then the $45 product I buy at the salon and has more Aragan too. Now I can not wait to try the emu oil they put out next. Highly recomed this line to others.</li>
    <li> I have been using Argan oil for nearly one year. This was the first time I purchased this brand. Of course for price. The seller sent email every day after the order until it arrived asking for if I received it and how is it? That is good and bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, the product itself - it does not have any smell - like other products I have used. I thought the natural Argan oil has pleasant mild perfume like smell. Well, I could be wrong and anyway smell is not  a bid deal. But the oil is much thinner than other brands. The consistency in this oil is similar to machine lubricating oil, while all others were similar to most vegetable oils. As this is a natural product of a plant, I would expect it to be similar to any other vegetable oil and not similar to thin petroleum product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did contact the seller about the quality concern of the product as mentioned. The response - &amp;#34;we use different extraction process  ....we hope you enjoy this product&amp;#34; Well, I did enjoy it, I wouldn&#x27;t be contacting you about the quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give two stars because despite the quality as mentioned, it can still be used (I think!) for hair, although more will need to be used. This extra oil need per use will wash out the savings over other better brand.</li>
    <li> Use this for my face and neck makes my skin feel soft like it very much</li>
    <li> I love that it comes in a dark glass bottle to preserve it.  It is also 100% and cold pressed which is my preferred when buying essential oils.</li>
    <li> Great product! Essential for my daily skin care routine. In the morning I use it all over the body after the toner and before sunscreen. In the evening on the top of my products. The skin never feels dry.  Great for all seasons, particularly in the winter time living in Manhattan with cold weather and heating in the apartment.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, course hair and have been searching for a leave in product to make it feel softer. This works better than the leave in conditioners I&#x27;ve been using. I wasnt very good at applying it evenly with my hands, so I filled the pipette and added it to a 5oz spray bottle of water (along with a few drops of rosemary for scent) which does the trick. Makes my hair shiny and soft!</li>
    <li> This oil is EXCELLENT! All the Leven Rose products I&#x27;ve purchased work great, and the argan oil is right up there with the best of &#x27;em; it&#x27;s effects on my hair and skin are better than advertised. Previously I bought some argan oil locally at a arts fair, and the Leven Rose product is purer, smells &amp;#34;sweeter&amp;#34;, and came in a dark bottle(the local stuff came in a clear bottle, and with the sunlight coming in the bathroom window it got funky).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even used some on my dog&#x27;s ears. She was itchy and dry, her ears were really bothering her. Two days of rubbing a few drops of this into her poor ears and she was a new dog(now I do it once a week, and she&#x27;s still happy!)</li>
    <li> This product so far is amazing! it has made my hair softer and shinier.</li>
    <li> I use it and it&#x27;s sooooooo nice</li>
    <li> Very nice , smells lovely.. Like everything about this argan oil... Really do like it and keep my hair smelly great</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using a 50/50 mix of leven rose&#x27;s Jojoba Oil and Argan Oil to help me deal with a persistent skin rash (eczema i think). really happy with the results. One of my Jojoba Oil containers arrived damaged and this seller was eager to send a replacement without hassle. will be ordering from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This oil is the best oil I have ever used... I love it I use it for my skin and hair and it works wonders for both my hair and skin I am so happy I found this argan oil... I also have the jojoba oil from this company and I must say I love that oil also not to mention this company have the best customer service ever they ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS .. I will buy both oils from this company again I am a happy customer</li>
    <li> Great product and the seller is great will buy a again</li>
    <li> Little to no smell at all!! and It does make my skin feel moisturized and it makes my hair shiny, this is the second bottle I buy and I love it!</li>
    <li> I wanted this product so that I could improve the quality of my hair and boy does it work great. It has multiple uses for the body and for making various home made beauty products. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought the bottle from amazon. First the delivery was fast and on time. As an experiment, I stopped using all other cosmetics and used only argan oil on my face for a month. My skin is looking soft shiny, flawless. I am 55. People have noticed the difference in my skin. I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
    <li> Arrived super fast. Absolutely love this oil. I use it in combination with jojoba oil. It has pretty much replaced all my extensive and expensive hair, skin, facial, and cuticle products. Not to mention how great it is on my 3 year old&#x27;s unruly hair and I know exactly what I&#x27;m using instead of worrying about what unknown ingredients I&#x27;m subjecting her to.</li>
    <li> I selected this because of information I had read about and also, the previous reviews of this seller and her product.  I liked the light feeling on my face and slight scent.  It wasn&#x27;t overpowering at all!  I use a drop of Argan Oil every day and evening on my face with a light massage.  It feels good and leaves my skin so soft.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants soft skin and a pure natural product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Leven Rose Argon Oil for only a week and usually I would not review this quickly....but....after the first use of this oil I knew it was a winner.  My hair felt as soft and was as moisturized as it would have been if I was using the more expensive brands of Argon oil on the market.  I use Argon Moroccan as the last step for my loc-ing agent for my natural kinky hair. This is what helps my hair stay moisturized longer than any other product I have every used.  I am impressed.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Leven Rose Jojoba Oil for about a month now, and have had excellent results. I have heard great things about Argan Oil, and knowing the quality of Leven Rose products, I ordered some. This oil is excellent! I use it daily on my hair after I get out of the shower, and before drying it. It keeps my hair nice and silky, looking like I just came from the salon, all day long. It really seals in the moisture to keep my hair from drying out and geting frizzy. I definitely give this a thumbs up, and recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use Argan oil for my face, neck and scalp.  I have used different types of Argan oil and this is one of my favorites. It is not sticky and it is odorless which makes it awesome.  The price is great for the value.  I would definitely purchase it product again.</li>
    <li> Great product! Makes my hair shiny, soft and silky!</li>
    <li> I just started using Argan oil on my face after 47 years.  Being a guy and not knowing any better I always thought oil on my face would break it out but was I wrong and I am glad I discovered LevenRose Argan oil. My facial tone has evened out and I believe my skin was very happy to finally be getting the moisturization it needed. Thanks</li>
    <li> Not what I bought it for but works great on my feet :)  Put it on at night or after a shower and it really helps with dry heels.  Need to use the file much less.  Looking forward to sandal season.  Nice bottle and the dropper is very handy.  Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> so i ordered this when it was 68$ dont waste your money on this. its definitly not a good deal. i broke out after first on my skin , then also when you use it on your hair it then becomes EXTREMLEY greasy</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive and very dry skin and hair, in spite of using good products and drinking lots of water. I live a bad-hair and bad-skin life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can spread this all over my face before bedtime and not worry about breakouts. My lips often shed flakes large enough to bite off and sometimes crack and bleed. I started spreading argan oil on them, topping it with Aquaphor, before bed. It _really_ helped, more than the Aquaphor alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also mix a bit in with my leave-in hair conditioner. Note that a little goes a long way for day-time hair use or your hair will look a bit oily. A dime-sized puddle in my palm is a bit much for my fine shoulder-length hair. Even in the &amp;#34;oops, I overdid it state,&amp;#34; upon returning from college, my elder son said, &amp;#34;wow, Mom, what are you putting on your hair? It looks great!&amp;#34; He&#x27;s similarly challenged and spilled ¾ of my previous (8x cost) Argan oil purchase on his bed. I&#x27;m buying him a bottle of this so that he can take it to his dad&#x27;s and school without intruding on my nice new &amp;#34;do.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I use it on my face immediately after my morning shower and then dust my face with loose powder just before leaving for work.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great price! I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this Argan oil at such a reasonable price but I am glad that I did. I love this stuff and it has now become the staple of my nightly routine. I mix a bit with some EO and it is my new favorite nightly moisturizer. 4oz will go a long way when just using a few drops each night. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your face/skin feeling oily. I usually apply almost immediately before I go to bed and I sleep on my side (face on the pillow) and I have never had a problem with it leaving oily marks on my sheets either.</li>
    <li> Difference is visible immediately for hairs as well skin. Hairs are shiny, silky and better manageable. Skin is radiant and younger. I use it in combination with my cream with mild massage. Amazing result! Can be honestly recommended to everybody.&lt;br /&gt;Sona</li>
    <li> Have ordered 4 Levenrose products recently &amp; I&#x27;m quite pleased so far, only been using for a few weeks but the Jojoba &amp; Argan seem to be controlling the breakage &amp; dryness some, &amp; Rosehip is helping with dry skin some also. Will update after longer usage. I received very quickly and well package. I will be trying some other items also but want to use these regularly long enough to make sure they perform as stated. So far I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try. They state 100% satisfaction guarantee &amp; great email support as well, if this helps</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I had some seriously dry, chapped skin around my nose from a sinus meltdown. I applied this Argan oil twice after a shower to my septum and nostrils and it totally restored my skin. No cracks, redness or pain after one day. Also my hair and scalp were extremely dry from general winter indoor heat and dryness. I use a few drops of Argan oil after washing my hair while it&#x27;s still wet. Moisture completely restored instantly. Hair is shiny, soft, no static flyaway. The key is to apply the oil a few drops at at time while the skin or hair is still damp. This oil seems to be the real deal, not cut with any other oils. It is very light and nourishing. I have never had it look or feel oily if applied properly. There is no scent to this oil. Excellent natural product.</li>
    <li> This is great argan oil! I use it for everything! I did a lot of research before I bought this product! I read that there was a plastic smell that was detected by other customers that purchased this product. For me there was a little bit of plastic smell at the beginning when I first used it but it went away after a little while. Even if the smell stayed it would still be a great deal and product to use. Especially considering the prices for Argan oil!</li>
    <li> Amazing!! I&#x27;ve purchased this oil before as well as the Jojoba oil. They are the best! I don&#x27;t use facial clensers anymore to remove makeup. I cleanse using oils and it&#x27;s cleared my complexion, dry skin patches, and acne! It does wonders for my whole body. I put these oils in all areas of my beauty routine and have never been let down. In love!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this but after doing some research I found that argan oil is made from “argan nuts” and that they are tree nuts.. Since my son has a severe tree nut allergy I had to return it. I wish it would have had an allergen warning on the label. I found the following comment on the Nespot Allergy website: If you are allergic to tree nuts, although argan nut is not on the list of the priority allergens, it would be prudent to avoid the use of argan oil.</li>
    <li> Enjoying my Argan Oil on my hair.  I have noticed a change already and it has made my hair smooth and shiny.  i know I will be finding a lot more ways to use this oil as well.  The oil came packaged well and very quickly!!</li>
    <li> Like putting motor oil in my hair. One of the grosses products I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> I got this because I recently had a baby and got bad stretch marks. My face also changed from my pregnancy and I got blackheads. This oil is helping me with both. I am so happy I brought it. I do not regret it. 2nd day of using it and its helping a lot. Will keep buying</li>
    <li> I was running out of my &amp;#34;argan&amp;#34; oil and searching to replace it.  After reading many Amazon reviews, I learned that many &amp;#34;argan&amp;#34; oils are made from something else.  Read my bottle to find out it was actually kernel oil.  Shocked.  I purchased this one because it was certified 100% pure organic argan oil and was priced reasonably.  I use it daily on my hair to help restore the shine it has lost after growing back from cancer treatment.  It lacks the perfumy smell that some other fake &amp;#34;argan&amp;#34; oils have, but that is a good thing, I think.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife but then I started using it on my dry hands. It&#x27;s worked amazingly well and the scent is very light - not floral at all. My wife said it&#x27;s worked great on split ends in her hair and on her skin. The shipping was prompt, the bottle was protected and arrived in good condition, and I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I was on the hunt, high and low, for an affordable but QUALITY Argon oil when I stumbled upon LevenRose! I have EXTREMELY damaged hair, like straw, and just two drops rubbed in my hands and then into my hair made my hair soft and smooth and shiny without weighing it down or making it greasy! I think the key is to only use the smallest amount you need and not overdo it. A little goes a long way to restore moisture and shine to your hair! This bottle will last me a long time, even with daily use. The value is unbeatable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciated that the scent was mild and not at all overpowering, but I was most impressed by the INSTANT improvement in my hair. I&#x27;ve been using products with argan oil in them for a long time and I&#x27;ve never gotten the results from it that I have with LevenRose 100% Pure Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was also SHOCKED at how fast this arrived once I ordered it. The people at LevenRose don&#x27;t mess around! They really care about making their customers happy. I would definitely buy this product again. I also really, really want to buy the jojoba oil as as soon as I can afford. I&#x27;ll be sharing about this product with all my friends and social media followers (many of whom use argan oil, but if they have any sense they will switch to this brand!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you LevenRose for such an exceptional product!</li>
    <li> This is a must have product.  I use it in my leave in conditioner along with jojoba oil and my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair is so healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost didn&#x27;t try it because I have never seen Argan Oil so affordable, I am so glad I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;It is light and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now one of my essential oils.</li>
    <li> I have been using the 100% pure argon oil for about 2 weeks.  I noticed a difference the first time.  I am an African-American woman and use this product as part of my leave-in conditioner and also use it to add some shine to my hair.  It&#x27;s great for frizz control.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be able to say if it will make my hair grow, but it is definitely shinier and less frizzy.  I plan to make this product a regular part of my hair care regimen.</li>
    <li> I love Argan oil for everything - body, face and hair.  This is of fantastic quality and I have ordered other products from this company and have been equally as happy!</li>
    <li> I have naturally kinky hair. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over one month and it really hydrates my hair. I have less breakage as well.</li>
    <li> This is pure Argan oil - no perfumes or additives.  The scent is barely noticeable and the customer service is great.  I received an email from the company as soon as I placed my order (and this is a fulfilled by Amazon order).  I received a 2nd email a couple of days later to make sure I had gotten my product.  I received a 3rd email asking if I was happy with the product.  I have used Argan oil with additives and paid the same or more.  I mix this with whatever lotion I am putting on and my really dry skin is very moisturized.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of the Josie Maran Argan Oil and I loved it! I couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing my skin looked. However, it&#x27;s quite expensive, so I thought I would look to find another argan oil on sale. I ordered this one and I really wanted to like it, but it&#x27;s not so great. My skin doesn&#x27;t look nearly as good as it did with the other. Also, I think mine went back because the smell is awful! It smells like something died. I am definitely bummed because I really wanted to like this (especially for the price), but I think I stick with the other one.</li>
    <li> I use Argan Oil like it is going out of style, so I was excited to find a 4 oz bottle for a crazy cheap price with so many good reviews. I like Leven Rose fine - I agree with other users who say it smells and feels a little different than other Argan Oil, and did think it was unusual that I couldn&#x27;t find any information about it online anywhere, but after a week, my skin didn&#x27;t break out and actually seemed very pleased and so I was also pleased. And then, as if in slow motion, I brushed it right off my counter top and the glass bottle with 4 oz of oil smashed all over my bathroom floor. So. Lessen learned - if you go for this, and you should consider it, be super super careful not to break it because it is a huge pain in the butt to clean up.</li>
    <li> Love this oil...works fantastic!!! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I have used the Argan oil for my face, hair and hands for a whole week and i can see huge improvement on my face with less breakage and acne scars, my hair is shinier and softer and my hands are moist and not as dry as it used to be especially in the heat of the summer. I love that it has almost no smell at all and I can put a generous amount of it on my hair as a mask and keep it overnight then wash it in the morning, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This is great for hair!  It makes my hair shiny and frizz-free all day.  I will buy again from them.  Frances from http://www.levenrose.com/ is sweet!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in my hair,  but it does not absorb and leaves my long blonde hair looking greasy (even with a small amount). I&#x27;ve started using it on my skin and it is very moisturizing and works well.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! It made my skin and hair softer and helped with my acne. I am satisfied with my purchase. :)</li>
