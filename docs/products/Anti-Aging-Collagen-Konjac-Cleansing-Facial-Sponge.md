<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This sponge is amazing.  It leaves my face feeling clean but not scraped raw (I have really sensitive skin).  I don&#x27;t even use cleanser--just the sponge is enough to keep my skin clean and happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sponge for about a week now and love it. It&#x27;s very gentle but definitely exfoliates. Feels great on my skin!</li>
    <li> I love this sponge!! My skin is very sensitive and I have eczema so I must be careful with what I use so as to not irritate my skin, but this sponge is FAB!! My skin is so soft after I use it and it actually helps with the itching on my face from the eczema!</li>
    <li> I love that there are no chemicals to worry about in the Ashieda Konjac Cleansing Sponge. I use mine in the shower since I have a shower mirror unless I have makeup on then it is at the bathroom sink. I like that it has a string coming out of it so I can hang it by my mirror in the shower, so it doesn’t get misplaced. The Ashieda Konjac Cleansing Sponge is a great addition to any eco-friendly skincare routine and can even replace traditional cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample of this product for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.</li>
    <li> I used this product as a special treat to wash the face of lady friend on her 91st birthday!  We took her out to breakfast after this and her face had a shiny glow!  I was impressed in the results after just one use on her.  Also, in the few days following, a blackhead that she had noticeably reduced, to my surprise, from only using the sponge once.  After wetting the sponge, it was very soft and also easy for my friend to hold and use at her young age of 91 years old!</li>
    <li> Not sure why it is shaped the way it is; seems like a larger, flat sponge would be more effective for facial purposes. It does do a decent job of cleansing, but the size and shape is strange. There&#x27;s also a string attached to it. Makes me wonder what this thing was originally manufactured for. I don&#x27;t think it started out as a facial sponge.</li>
    <li> I love this! Not harsh to skin as you cleanse. It actually gives your skin a smooth feeling and glow!</li>
    <li> Not really a major fan of this product. I used this sponge for a few weeks and finally decided to stop using it. I couldn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin, and I&#x27;m still not sure what the benefits of the product were. I used it with face wash sometimes, and without sometimes - never really noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I tried it and really like it. It makes my face feel smooth. It&#x27;s not rough like other sponges I have used in the past. I have dry skin and it&#x27;s really made a difference. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a small half sphere sponge made from Konjac Root. It arrives **** (I was blocked from using the word for extra firm here--), and after a minute under running water turns into a lovely soft texture. It is the most ideal thing I have ever used to wash my face with. The texture and softness is incredible, and it leaves my facial skin feeling smooth and soft. It seems to have some sort of property that imparts a special softness to the face. I never thought anything that I applied cleanser with could do anything special for my skin but this is amazing. It feels great and makes my skin look great. This actually shocked me when it not only felt wonderful to scrub my face with, but made my skin so super smooth and soft. Scrub is the wrong word to use, as it&#x27;s totally gentle. And yet it seems to exfoliate somehow. I can&#x27;t praise this little sponge highly enough. I actually have two of them and will be using one on my body. This is amazing and I won&#x27;t be using anything else to clean my face with after this. This is one of my rare ten star products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note that a free sample was sent to me for review</li>
    <li> I have a lot of blackheads on my nose and the sponge with cleaners of course worked really well together.  I don&#x27;t have as many blackheads on my nose after about 3 weeks of continuous cleaning and it was very soothing to the touch.  I received this item for a honest review.</li>
    <li> This is a hemi-spherical sponge made from Konjac root extract, which means that this is a natural product. Konjac is a herb that grows mostly in  eastern Asia, from Japan and China to Indonesia. A variety of food items are made using it, which means that it is a safe natural product that will not have any harmful effect for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hemispherical sponge needs to be soaked in water as explained on the product-pack and it has to be used only when it attains the right consistency. I found that the product gives excellent result when used as directed. Of course, the tolerance for skin-products varies from person to person and everyone should do the customary checks before using it for a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend use of the product as directed. The results would be gratifying.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine promoted this to me and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did. I did not use any product with it: just the sponge itself. It left my skin feeling smooth, soft and clean. I like it!</li>
    <li> I cannot get enough of this sponge. I actually cannot get enough of all the Ashieda products. Anyways, this has helped my face look younger and better than ever, along with the mask I am totally never going to any other product again!</li>
    <li> Uh, I feel like a girl (jk), simply amazing skin cleansing sponge. I&#x27;m a 29 year old male, whom typically doesn&#x27;t do much if any &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; remedies. I lack the common ambition to even put lotion on my body because, well I am a male, I am lazy and I don&#x27;t care much about beauty remedies in general ha. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve realize my warranty on my body is depleting extremely quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered a trial of this product and I decided to try it, usually I decline on beauty products because, again I am too lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin since using the acne drug Accutane when I was 16 years old, so I don&#x27;t like to have a lot of things on or near my face. I don&#x27;t like to wash my face daily as I feel it irritates my skin too much and I breakout in rashes. After using the sponge, my face felt so fresh and so clean. It felt invigorated and hydrated. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all which was extremely pleasing and surprising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels vibrant and fresh and clean. The best part is its all natural which a lot of people look for. I am a believer. I easily can recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;-Cleanse pores, eliminate blackheads, dirt and oil without need of another cleanser&lt;br /&gt;-Naturally moisturize your skin&lt;br /&gt;-Gently exfoliate your skin, bringing out a natural shine&lt;br /&gt;-Balance the PH of your skin, Help repair and renew your skin&lt;br /&gt;-100% Natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;Honestly none that I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample of this product for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.</li>
    <li> this is a great product if you&#x27;re looking for something different to cleanse your face. I bought this product and was surprised to see that it cleansed my skin beautifully. will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge, very neat.  Hard when dry, super spongy when wet, and does a great job exfoliating...gently!</li>
    <li> This cleansing sponge is palm-sized, and rounded, with a flat bottom.  When moistened, the sponge is quite soft and pliable.  The slippery surface glides gently over the skin, removing loose skin and dirt on the face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can apparently be used to apply lotion, moisturizer, or skin cleanser, however these substances might shorten the life of the sponge, so do so at your own risk.  If you want to gently pamper your face, this sponge is great for a quick refreshing cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for evaluation.</li>
    <li> Thanks you so much for this sponge!!! I love it! Now that I&#x27;ve tried it for free, with promo code that was over a month ago. I will be an avid customer!! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sponge!! I got one for free during a brief promotion. It is wonderful!! I haven&#x27;t had to use any facial cleanser, which, in turn, has caused my face to produce less oil than usual. I love it so much that I ordered 2 more for my medicine cabinet so I&#x27;m ready when this one and the next run out. I also ordered one each for my mom, sister, and best friend as Christmas gifts! The company is very customer-friendly as well. The response from the promotion was greater than they expected, so shipping took longer than I expected. When I contacted them, they were super friendly. The friendly response and the positive results I&#x27;ve seen have me SOLD!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome!  I love using this sponge!</li>
    <li> I love my Ashieda Sponge! I usually don&#x27;t use any soap with it and it has made my face clear up dramatically. I have incredibly sensitive skin and although I&#x27;m 26, I still have the occasional break out. Since I&#x27;ve used the sponge my face has been incredibly clear and looks great! Will continue to order.</li>
    <li> it takes all my deadskin ..i use it every 3 days.. very good sponge!</li>
    <li> I love this product... great for exfoliating! Only problem I had is the the package instructions were written in small pale pink type on a semi-transparent plastic packet... impossible to read!!! Improve the packaging and this is a 5-star product!</li>
    <li> After using the sponge for a couple weeks I can honestly say it&#x27;s one of those things that I didn&#x27;t know I needed it&#x27;s really gentle on my skin and I love using it with my simple cleaner. I was a little thrown off by the way It arrives it waschard textured like a rock but after running it under water it became very soft and luxurious feeling</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I received one for free and I must say, it definitely does the job! Will certainly buy one in the future.</li>
    <li> so far so good after using it couple months.  Very smooth and can peel off dead skin fairly easily.  Works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Its light weight but a little rough.</li>
    <li> When I opened the package I was a little surprised to see this little and extremely hard sponge.  Before using it you are supposed to get the sponge wet so it will soften and also get  what bigger. I followed the instructions and did exactly what it told me to do. I put the sponge under warm water and to be honest it was fun to watch it grow. I ended up having a bigger and really soft sponge. Even though it can be use without any facial cleanser I decided to use my cleanser. I thought that the sponge was going to be a little rough so it would remove dead skin cells but it was extremely soft  against my skin. I washed my face using the sponge in circular motions like the instructions told me to and when I rinsed my face I was pleasantly surprised to see that it removed all the dead skin cells and also cleaned my pores. The sponge is so soft that it could be used on any skin type and even on baby skin. This sponge is amazing, I would totally recommend it! This is a great addition to your skincare routine and definitely now that winter is almost here and your skin tends to get dry and flaky.</li>
    <li> Soothing to the skin when in the shower.</li>
    <li> I like it, makes my pores smaller, my face feels different, I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Great sponge, I use it every night after I take off my make up and my skin feels very soft!</li>
    <li> I just used it and it&#x27;s so different from any other facial sponge that I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s not harsh at all and it does the job of getting rid of dead skin! My face feels so smooth and soft I&#x27;ll definitely be replacing it again in 8 weeks. Love it!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I already recieved my sponged and i really like it im using it to my my face rite now and it is really good i really recommend it to my friend :)</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE spongagesi was lucky enough to try it for free in exchange for my honest review. I have to say i love these and didnt know how i survived with out them!, This one is 100% natural and doesnt have any Free of Chemicals, Parabens, Sulphates, Fragrances &amp; Coloring. Good for Extra Sensitive Skin, Hypoallergenic - Cruelty Free, Vegan, Biodegradable, Naturally Sustainable -It even comes with a money backj guarantee!! Im so impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i got this in the mail, i kinda looked at it for a minute and thoooght how is this going to wash my face? I put the sponge in water and waited a short time. It went from rock hard to soft. I used it on my face, I figured it would clean it but that was it, after i washed my face and dried it , i felt it. Boy was it smooth!!! this thing really works and works well!. This sponge will last 2-3 months, what a greta deal. I will be using this every day!</li>
    <li> For less than $5.00 for this and you don&#x27;t even need to purchase an additional cleanser! I would totally recommend this to anyone with a face! :) This makes my face so soft and prepped for my daily facial regimen. This comes to you hard as a rock, with a string attached to it for hanging, and comes in a cute little package that says Ashieda in big letters across it and says Original Konjac Sponge. It is a rip a part package, with a notch in the side for tearing, it&#x27;s pretty easy. It takes about 2 minutes running it under water to get it soft, but oh my, once you do, it is like a piece of heaven your rubbing all over your face! I suggest rubbing it, in little circular motions all over your face, neck and chest if your a woman. I have been using this everyday for about 3 weeks and I will buy a few next time just to have a few on hand! What a cute Stocking Stuffer for that Beauty Queen in your life! I also have this in my Stocking Stuffer Gift guide on my blog here http://www.tinascouponswap.com/gift-guide-stocking-stuffers/ I have a lot of cool things listed! Maybe you&#x27;ll find something for that hard to shop for person in your life!! Now get yourself some Ashieda Konjac Facial Sponge! I promise, you will LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> I have used other konnyaku sponges before, this is lovely and good price. I didn&#x27;t want the collagen additive though, although it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any noticeable difference. I just didn&#x27;t want any animal products in my face sponge.  UPDATE JULY 2015: have been using the current sponge for about 6 months with no sign of deterioration :) awesome! I use mine every day. Just went to repurchase but the price has shot up to almost $10.... boohoooo....</li>
    <li> I wanted to thoroughly test the Konjac sponge prior to leaving a review so that I could be honest with my experience. Shipping was prompt, and the sponge arrived in simple packaging. It is coarse and firm, softening as watered. The first week I noticed that it helped significantly with exfoliating my skin without being too abrasive. My skin felt softer, and it effectively softened harder areas of my skin. It didn&#x27;t help with blackheads, my nose is a problem area and I was hoping it would alleviate some of the blackheads prone to the area but they remained. Overall, the sponge was effective and worked as promised, minus the blackhead removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;*Exfoliating&lt;br /&gt;*Design conveniently fits in the palm of your hand.&lt;br /&gt;*100$ all natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;*Didn&#x27;t help with blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sample was provided for my review</li>
    <li> This product is really good, I have been using this for a little while now and I can see the reduction of acne scars. It is also not a harsh sponge so gets the job done but doesn&#x27;t scratch your face.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought it would be upon arrival. I have not used it yet, so I will update the review when I do.</li>
    <li> Took a chance on the &amp;#34;off brand&amp;#34; of these konjac sponges and wasn&#x27;t disappointed. The shape is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand the flat side of the half-sphere shape is good for cheeks and forehead with the other side working well on the contours around the eye-area and nose. On the other hand the overall thickness at the peak of the sphere shape means it takes longer to absorb water and be ready for use. Dries out evenly, too! These were on sale when I bought them so I bought a few and gave them to friends to have them try as well. Everyone really likes them!</li>
    <li> I love these cleanser and would purchase again and again. They last a long time and are soft to clean sensitive faces.  I have purchased about five of these so far. I recommend this priduct</li>
    <li> WOW. I can&#x27;t believe how soft my face feels after using this! The texture at first is like a rice cake, but once wet it turns into a gel like texture. My pores which are normally huge, have decreased in size. Not drastically, but enough to actually notice a difference. My face is so soft after using this. I was really skeptical about using it since you dont need a cleanser, but it is a very soft exfoliating on your face.  I can&#x27;t wait to try all of them.I received this product in exchange for an honest review, regardless I only recommend products I think others will enjoy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this sponge. It&#x27;s great for exfoliating and makes skin soft. Not a magical acne cure but a great part of my skin care regime.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I first ordered this and didn&#x27;t know what it was supposed to do. I was incredibly surprised by the effect it had on my skin from just one use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have skin issues or anything like that and have a very simple make up routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I used this sponge I didn&#x27;t need any foundation. My skin was smooth, not shiny and all the little lines were gone. The bags under my eyes were almost gone as well. I even had people commentig on how great my make up looked, even though I was wearing even less than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am VERY pleased and will be recommending this to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Love this sponge!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really great, natural way to exfoliate.  It takes a few minutes of getting water on the sponge for it to soften, but when it does it is just lovely.  It does not feel harsh but still does the job.  It makes me feel like I&#x27;m on a beach in Bali!!!</li>
    <li> Wow!!! Ok, this is an awesome sponge. I&#x27;ve been using almost no soap when I wash my face with this and it&#x27;s really amazing how nice my skin feels. I was doubtful when I first started using it, but now I&#x27;m totally obsessed! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to cleaning my face with cleanser again!</li>
    <li> When I received this sponge I was confused. It was so hard! After leaving it under warm water for about 30 seconds though the fibers expand and it gets soft and pliable. I used this alone and while it was very soft and gentle on my skin I did not feel like it was doing much int he way of exfoliation. However when I paired this with a sugar scrub to use on my face I found it really held up and the scrub did not fall into the sponge and get lost like some other products (You know how you put a product on your sponge and it disappears and you have to use more? not so with this!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you put this up, either just on the side of your tub or using the attached string, it will dry out quickly and feel quite odd (kind of slimy but fun) and then dry completely, it will not go back to the original super hard state, not that I have seen anyways. Just run it under water and its back to its pliable nature. I do love this product, I use it once a week when i exfoliate my face, it is the perfect size to cup your cheeks and chin and get into all those nooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review.</li>
    <li> I have used this sponge on my face for almost two weeks now and find it perfect for my very sensitive skin .. it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;scratch&#x27;, it&#x27;s soft enough and at the same time lightly exfoliating ... works for me!</li>
    <li> Great cleansing sponge, feels good. I would repurchase this item!</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made. Thank goodness it was free.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. It isn&#x27;t much of an exfoliator but for free item it is what it is. My husband likes it.</li>
    <li> Great sponge for a free item! Love it! :)</li>
    <li> Felt soft, not harsh on skin face and works great for exfoliation without any harm on skin face.</li>
    <li> Works wells on cleaning the skin</li>
    <li> this was promoted to me by a friend.  i tried it i liked it.  i will keep ordering this product.</li>
    <li> This simple little sponge packs a surprisingly big punch.  It has this wonderful soothing effect on my face.  I use it in the shower and it just feels so good on my skin. It exfoliates, but so gently that you hardly notice.  The size is just right for maneuvering it around your face without getting soap in your eyes, too.  I actually like to use it instead of my Clairsonic and I was not expecting that. Highly recommend for everyday use.  (P.S. This is a woman writing from my husband&#x27;s account.:))</li>
    <li> This is the first sponge I&#x27;ve found that isn&#x27;t too harsh on my face. It exfoliates really well and my skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated at all. I definitely love it.</li>
    <li> Love the durability....and how it feels on my face. Love it cleanses with plain water.  Wish it were bath size.</li>
    <li> very clean feeling and is great for your skin to become smooth</li>
    <li> This sponge leaves your face feeling so smooth. It exfoliates and refreshes your face so well. I have oily skin and this has helped so much, it has made a big difference in how my skin feels.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a magical sponge that hardens when dry but softens and cleans when wet. No soap needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have had it for quite some time now and it doesn&#x27;t have an odor or stench as one would think something like this would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my face looking clean!</li>
    <li> I use this scrub twice a day and love the way it feels on my face- soft but exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a great alternative if you can&#x27;t quite afford those electric face scrubbers- this is essentially the same thing!&lt;br /&gt;I also have to use a lot less or no face wash versus when I use to use my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Once you use this you&#x27;ll wonder why you weren&#x27;t before!</li>
    <li> I love this product it took me over 30 years to finally find a product for my over sensitive skin. The product exfoliates and cleanses and leaves my skin smooth with NO irritation. lOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I love it, thanks Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> My wife bought the first one for me as a gift and she really persuaded me. I use it almost every day and use it without the cleanser. I’ll continue buying this sponge</li>
    <li> Cleanses very well. I like that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
    <li> I have been using this sponge for a little over a month and I really like it. It may appear rough, but once you get it wet and you pass it over your face, you will notice that it is actually rather gentle on the skin. It works well to exfoliate your skin and has kept my skin smooth. This contains no dyes, additives or preservatives. It works well and has become part of my daily skin routine. I use it every night in the shower after removing my makeup and cleansing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do like this. I can see visible results as my skin looks a bit ... lighter, freer, clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this was a lesser quality than the higher priced sponges, the konjac isn&#x27;t quite as dense. But I find that it works just as well and seems just as good. Great deal for half the price!</li>
    <li> I might be addicted.  I use scrub gloves for my body, but you can&#x27;t use that on your face.  This has just the right amount of exfoliation to it and my face looks and feels great afterwards.  Yay!</li>
    <li> i love this sponge coz everytime i use it i feel that my face is really really clean.</li>
    <li> This is great for cleaning my face, left my skin feeling very soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to Konjac sponges! Decided to try this brand out as I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a konjac sponge that doesnt fall completely apart by week 3. This one lasted 5 weeks just fine! I like the fact that I get more bang for my buck and can use it for my body after 5-6 weeks (hey, gotta squeeze every last penny out of it!)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the fuss is about....maybe I am using it incorrectly...</li>
    <li> I did like this sponge a lot, although I just don&#x27;t feel comfortable giving it 5 stars since I&#x27;m not sure I can say that I LOVE it. I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week now, so if over time my opinion of it changes I will update my review. It did do a great job of clearing up some rough winter skin issues I was having on my face. I don&#x27;t use soap with it, just warm water. If I&#x27;m wearing makeup, I use olive oil to remove the makeup first. Then, I just use warm water and the sponge. My face feels clean and my skin tone looks even in the morning when I wake up. I think it&#x27;s a nice addition to someone&#x27;s skin care routine if they need some gentle exfoliation.</li>
    <li> amazing. makes my skin so smooth</li>
