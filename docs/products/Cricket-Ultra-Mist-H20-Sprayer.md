      <li>The mist is very fine and evenly distributed.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very nice, sprays well, and is consistent.</li>
      <li>Now, it produces a nice, fine mist.</li>
      <li>and I bought 2 more.  </li>
      <li>Love the Cricket Ultra Mist Sprayer.  </li>
      <li>I love it..</li>
      <li>Love this water bottle because it &amp;#34;sprays&amp;#34; a medium mist.</li>
      <li>Another girl at school got one that also did not work, but she was able to somehow get it working.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love them.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice fine mist and easy to pump.</li>
      <li>but this is one of the best ones I have had in a long time</li>
      <li>it is easy to mix the anti-tap solution and water in this for the extension bonds and it sprays a fine even mist effortlessly.</li>
      <li>Produces a really fine, strong mist.</li>
      <li>Sure, it&#x27;s stylish, sure, every professional stylist I&#x27;ve ever been to has one of these sprayers, and sure, it puts out a super-fine mist...</li>
      <li>My stylist uses this sprayer and I was looking for a fine mist sprayer to do mine and my kids hair.  </li>
      <li>This mister is perfect when you want to do touch-ups on the hair that require a little water mist.  </li>
      <li>these sprayers really give a nice mist.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>The sprayer feels like very nice quality and should last.</li>
      <li>Other than that great product, recommend for anyone who has arthritis in the hands.</li>
      <li>Fabulous mister, exactly like the one my hair salon uses.</li>
      <li>This particular bottle is made with good internal parts and it is able to spray even thin liquids with good force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>The plastic piece that bears the most torque when you squeeze the trigger is only 2-3 millimeters thick!&lt;br /&gt;You will regret our purchasing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like you can spray your own misty fog to get your hair evenly damp or wet.  </li>
      <li>If I need it wetter, I just do several more sprays.  </li>
      <li>Very even mist over a sizeable diameter.  </li>
      <li>Is very well dispersed.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It is great to tame down strayed hair in the mornings.  </li>
      <li>It is a pretty decent product, actually!</li>
      <li>You guys sent me two bottles cause the first was didn&#x27;t work and my second bottle didn&#x27;t work either</li>
      <li>Many spray bottles were not able to spray rubbing alcohol, for some reason.  </li>
      <li>I needed a fine mist to apply my hair vitamins but what came out was just a regular spray that was too wet in spots and not an all over mist.  </li>
      <li>It gives you just enough water without being too much</li>
      <li>They last so much longer than regular sprayers you can buy in the store.  </li>
      <li>so it was such a waist of money and the issue never was fixed.</li>
      <li>So far, I have not got my second one to work either.  </li>
      <li>Apparently the one I got was a dud.  </li>
      <li>It may be a little tricky getting it to first spray.  </li>

<li> I was disappointed with the mist, it was definitely not a ultra mist that sprayed out.  </li>
<li> Sorry, Cricket, you stink.</li>
<li> and they both are terrible.  </li>

    <li> This mister is perfect when you want to do touch-ups on the hair that require a little water mist.  It is perfect for me.  The mist is very fine and evenly distributed.  If I need it wetter, I just do several more sprays.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Been using this spray bottle daily without any problems.  It may be a little tricky getting it to first spray.  What I do is; squeeze fully down on the trigger as to build up water pressure.  Simple as that.  Produces a really fine, strong mist.</li>
    <li> I find it very easy to use except for the amount of time you need to prime it before it sprays. Other than that great product, recommend for anyone who has arthritis in the hands.</li>
    <li> This is a 5 star product when it works.  A girl at school has the same one and I LOVED it.  I bought one here on amazon and it does not spray.  I returned it and bought another one at the beauty store and that one doesn&#x27;t work either.  Another girl at school got one that also did not work, but she was able to somehow get it working. So far, I have not got my second one to work either.  If it works, it&#x27;s the best, finest, even spray ever. But I can&#x27;t seem to get one that works!</li>
    <li> I rarely find the negative in much of anything, but this product is simply awful. Sure, it&#x27;s stylish, sure, every professional stylist I&#x27;ve ever been to has one of these sprayers, and sure, it puts out a super-fine mist...but I have no idea how it could last in a commercial setting. I used this sprayer all of 4 times and it broke - not for a hundred pumps each time, either. i probably squeezed the trigger 10 times total! I opened it up to see the inner workings and where it malfunctioned. The plastic piece that bears the most torque when you squeeze the trigger is only 2-3 millimeters thick!&lt;br /&gt;You will regret our purchasing. Sorry, Cricket, you stink.</li>
    <li> You guys sent me two bottles cause the first was didn&#x27;t work and my second bottle didn&#x27;t work either so it was such a waist of money and the issue never was fixed.</li>
    <li> these sprayers really give a nice mist. they work perfect and look very sleek and hi tech on my station.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I saw my friends Natalie Dyson who is owner/operator of Florida Hair Extensions and the official sponsor for the Miss Florida pageants using it. it is easy to mix the anti-tap solution and water in this for the extension bonds and it sprays a fine even mist effortlessly.</li>
    <li> Fabulous mister, exactly like the one my hair salon uses.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the mist, it was definitely not a ultra mist that sprayed out.  I needed a fine mist to apply my hair vitamins but what came out was just a regular spray that was too wet in spots and not an all over mist.  No way to adjust either.</li>
    <li> We keep it on our truck to sterilize pruning tools.  Many spray bottles were not able to spray rubbing alcohol, for some reason.  This particular bottle is made with good internal parts and it is able to spray even thin liquids with good force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it does eventually break from getting thrown around, I&#x27;ll just buy another one.</li>
    <li> This is the best spray bottle I&#x27;ve ever used - but it could be better.  It&#x27;s like you can spray your own misty fog to get your hair evenly damp or wet.  I have not noticed any wayward streams of water like other bottles.  My only gripe is the design of the bottle.  The hand trigger takes a few pumps to prime itself and it feels flimsy under my fingers when I spray.  This bottle will also save you counter space with its sleek design.  This just needs a sturdier trigger to be PERFECT.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it&#x27;s gonna do! I love it! It gives you just enough water without being too much</li>
    <li> Took a bit of time to &amp;#34;prime,&amp;#34; but once it got going the mister worked a treat.  Very even mist over a sizeable diameter.  Perfect for art projects using aqueous or alcohol-based media, where a blast from a canned fixative would be too much.</li>
    <li> It took a couple of days of off and on playing with this until it finally started spraying. We don&#x27;t know why it wouldn&#x27;t start, nor why it finally did. Now, it produces a nice, fine mist. My wife uses it to moisten her hair.</li>
    <li> I got tired of having cheap water sprayers and saw that my stylist used this one. It&#x27;s very nice, sprays well, and is consistent. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this sprayer and I was looking for a fine mist sprayer to do mine and my kids hair.  I bought 2 of these and they both are terrible.  They don&#x27;t spray anything half the time and the other half they splatter water down the middle of the spray stream.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve gotten a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; product, but so far I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> Very nice! The mist. Is very well dispersed. The sprayer feels like very nice quality and should last. A long time. Pricey though.</li>
    <li> I had no troubles with my sprayer.  I think it is a great product that works wonderfully.  I did have a hard time getting it to work when I first bought it.  Here is the tip:  depress trigger all the way until it clicks, this \\&quot;primes\\&quot; the bottle.  overall grade: A</li>
    <li> Love the Cricket Ultra Mist Sprayer.  It is great to tame down strayed hair in the mornings.  Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I already had one of these sprayers and I bought 2 more.  Absolutely love them.  They last so much longer than regular sprayers you can buy in the store.  It&#x27;s a nice fine mist and easy to pump.</li>
    <li> I love it.. Great. Product..bottle sprays good no clog and I have had a lot of bottles but this is one of the best ones I have had in a long time</li>
    <li> Perfect mist, truly a mist sprayer.</li>
    <li> I wrote for directions and received information about the product but not how to make it work.  Apparently the one I got was a dud.  Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Update -- Okay, I&#x27;m an idiot -- it does work -- it is just a little frustrating/difficult to get it started.  It is a pretty decent product, actually!</li>
    <li> Love this water bottle because it &amp;#34;sprays&amp;#34; a medium mist. It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;squirt&amp;#34; a stream! Perfect for dampening hair or misting plants! Hard to find so i bought 2!</li>
