    <li> Great fragrance for a young teenager.  Not too much or overpowering in the aroma.  Daughter is 14 and she get lots of compliments on this fragrance.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this fragrance!  A friend bought me Yes Yes as a Christmas gift and I instantly fell in love with the fragrance.  I&#x27;ve never experienced the real Can Can before so I sought it out but didn&#x27;t like it.  Can Can smells nice enough but lacks the &#x27;zing&#x27; that Yes Yes has.  I carry Yes Yes with me everywhere and when need a little pick-me-up, spritz it on and life is good!  I hope this fragrance will be around forever!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume so much. I got it as a present one year for Christmas and instantly fell in love. I wore it all the time and cannot wait to buy more of it! I&#x27;ve never smelt the actually &#x27;Can Can&#x27; by why do you need that when you have this amazing smelling perfume? I&#x27;d of course reccommend this. :)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume!&lt;br /&gt;So glad I found it when they stopped selling it at DEBS.</li>
    <li> My niece had this and my mother loved it. So I got it for her. She absolutely loves loves loves it.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, good buy.  Smells good</li>
    <li> ❤️❤️❤️❤️This perfume!!</li>
    <li> excellent product, thank you very much.</li>
    <li> While I think the scent of Yes Yes is sweet and candy like it doesn&#x27;t have much staying power. It  evaporates really quickly the scent disappears in less than an hour if sprayed directly onto your skin. I would recommend that you spray it onto your clothes or at the nape of your neck if anything this might help to hold the scent a bit longer. I like the smell of this product but the duration is a bit off and then again I guess you get what you pay for the pricing is great I have more than a few of the PREFERRED FRAGRANCE impressions and many of them last for a good while on my skin This is one that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I ordered this believing I was getting such a great smelling perfume...I was fooled, it didnt even come in a box, there is no name on the bottle, and the smell was awful. I think it&#x27;s a KNOCK OFF....so instead of being a YES YES, it was a disappointing NO NO! I lost money on this deceitful purchase.</li>
    <li> Yes yes a impression of Paris Hilton Can Can by preffered fragrance. It&#x27;s soft and sweet, but not to sweet. I have tried MANY of the fragrances by preffered fragrance and this one is a winner! If you like Can Can you will like this just as well if not better. I recommend giving it a try. You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume so so much.It reminds me of cotton candy and sugary goodness mixed together.It also puts me in a girly sort of bubbly mood.It is so feminine and young at the same time.It makes you smell yummy lol.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells really nice :) I can&#x27;t can&#x27;t really describe it&#x27;s scent but you should trust me and kNOw kNOw that yes yes is a good impression of can can :) (lameness switch now deactivated)</li>
    <li> I dunno what the real one smells like. but this was lovely. has kinda like a sweet candy smell to it.  not over powering but not hidden either. sticks to your clothes more then it does on your skin. I spray the hell outt my clothes. wont hurt to spray the skin though. all in all was a nice buy</li>
    <li> This product seems to be inconsistent. I purchased a small bottle from a local store, and loved it. The bottle I orders online, however, had a different fragrance. I was very disapointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume years ago and fell in love with the scent it smells awesome..I buy several bottles every time I see it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have stay that long but when you smell your clothes later its wonderful. I would suggest to spray on your body first, then on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great I love it.</li>
    <li> I found Yes Yes a fragrant alternative to Can Can.&lt;br /&gt;Although a little sweeter smelling, it definitely exudes the essence of Can Can&lt;br /&gt;Can Can gives the raw smells of a smoke filled cabaret, Yes Yes plays it a little safer&lt;br /&gt;Wished that the fragrance lasted a little longer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking online for some time for this perfume and finally found it.  Preferred Fragrance Inc.,  has good products and ships out in a speedy manner.  I am very pleased with my order and the condition of the product when it arrived.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried Can Can ..but I personally Love thee Yes.Yes perfume I have used it for 3yrs straight and i don&#x27;t get tired of using it . . So try it</li>
    <li> Smells so good!!!! I get complements all the time on my perfume!</li>
    <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO,  VENDIDO TAL COMO DESCRIBE EN LA WEB DE AMAZON , RECOMENDADO ESPECIALMENTE PARA QUIENES DESEEN DARSE UN REGALO Y AHORRAR AL MISMO TIEMPO</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on positive product reviews upon receipt of my order I realized the smell is too strong for me. It gave me mild headache, I contacted OEM Run for return they refunded my shipping and I kept the perfume and gave it to a friend who seemed to like the smell. I had best experience with this merchant - I will shop again in future - thank you OEM Run</li>
    <li> entrega al día mercancía en buen estado responsables los productos que uno compra son los que envían tal cual como se hace el pedido.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I bought as a birthday gift and the individual was really pleased and loved the scent. I do to. Thanks</li>
    <li> With the price of EVERYTHING sky high, it&#x27;s really nice to find a company that puts out a high quality product , with a price tag that&#x27;s super affordable. The perfume is not an exact match, (what imitation is) but is so close to the original, it&#x27;s worth getting. There&#x27;s no doubt about me coming back for seconds, thirds, ect, ect...</li>
