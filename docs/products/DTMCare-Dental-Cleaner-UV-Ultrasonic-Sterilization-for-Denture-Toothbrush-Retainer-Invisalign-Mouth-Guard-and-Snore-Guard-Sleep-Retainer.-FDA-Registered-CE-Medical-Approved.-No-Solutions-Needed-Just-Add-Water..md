      <li>Just add water and it cleans your mouth pieces perfectly.</li>
      <li>The best cleaner for my mouth guard I have tried in three years.</li>
      <li>It works great.</li>
      <li>great product.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t do a great job of getting the particles off</li>
      <li>Am very pleased with size, convenience of no plug required and ease of use.  </li>
      <li>I liked this cleaner in the beginning, but two weeks after using it, it stopped working.  </li>
      <li>It does an excellent job, my years old mouth guard looks better all the time.</li>
      <li>If you want your retainer cleaned successfully, buy a more powerful sonic cleaner.  </li>
      <li>I would rather just put the tablet in the water bath of this unit but don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s OK to do that or not.</li>
      <li>And, this statement isn&#x27;t correct, as it turns the ultrasonic feature off after 5 minutes, but the UV part keeps going for about 15 more minutes.</li>
      <li>My husband got top dentures, because he doesn&#x27;t brush like he should.</li>
      <li>Much more convenient for my living space.  </li>
      <li>The box it came in was the most secure packaging I&#x27;ve ever seen . . .</li>
      <li>I can clean better with a turd.</li>
      <li>It easy to use</li>

      <li>I use this to clean my mouth guard.  </li>
      <li>Had to return it, This thing doesn&#x27;t clean anything.</li>
      <li>It helps keep my oral appliances clean.</li>
      <li>I saw another reviewer that mentioned using hydrogen peroxide to clean the unit</li>
      <li>Thank you for helping me keep my husbands choppers clean.</li>
      <li>You have to clean them seperately and the full clean cycle with water takes 20 minutes for each denture.</li>
      <li>(battery power is available if you want it), UV light and high</li>
      <li>/&gt;The size of the unit is fine for my clear retainers</li>
      <li>(I also scrub first with soap and a toothbrush).  </li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the product and would recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>I liked the unit while it worked, but both functions stopped working less than a year after I bought it.  </li>
      <li>More than what I expected.  </li>
      <li>cleans really well.  </li>
      <li>I want the mouth guard to be as clean as possible and this certainly helps.  </li>
      <li>I like the high volume of vibrations (or</li>
      <li>Very durable so far.</li>
      <li>The second one worked for two weeks but now the blue light works but no vibration.</li>
      <li>It works very well, but I was disapinted that for the price it did not clean both the top and bottom dentures at the same time.  </li>
      <li>I ordered a second one and returned the first one.</li>
      <li>So pretty quiet.</li>
      <li>I thought if I spent this much on one, it would be more effective but this is just as powerless as the first one I bought and paid less for.</li>
      <li>You obviously can&#x27;t use it when feeding a toothbrush through the little door in the unit top.</li>
      <li>run it twice every morning - the second time, I flip the mouth guard over to expose the other side to the UV light.  </li>
      <li>Works very well and looks like it will hold up for a long time.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t realize it ran on batteries as well as direct current.  </li>
      <li>but it would be too small to hold a full set of dentures.</li>
      <li>the device is to small to clean both upper and lower dental plates at once.</li>
      <li>To small for full upper and lower at the same time.</li>
      <li>Was looking for a way to keep partial and retainer clean without using harsh chemicals.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I liked the unit while it worked, but both functions stopped working less than a year after I bought it.  I would not recommend this product because it does not last.  I have read other similar reviews, too!</li>
    <li> I liked this cleaner in the beginning, but two weeks after using it, it stopped working.  Back It went!</li>
    <li> I purchased the item as a holiday gift for my father. It works very well, but I was disapinted that for the price it did not clean both the top and bottom dentures at the same time.  You have to clean them seperately and the full clean cycle with water takes 20 minutes for each denture. The product is not as convenient as I would have preferred.</li>
    <li> The instructions are translated to English from Chinese.  It easy to use but the instructions don&#x27;t match always.  It seems to work correctly but it is rather noisey and its container is rather small</li>
    <li> If you want your retainer cleaned successfully, buy a more powerful sonic cleaner.  I did not notice any difference at all and this is my second sonic cleaner I purchased.  I thought if I spent this much on one, it would be more effective but this is just as powerless as the first one I bought and paid less for.</li>
    <li> I use this to clean my mouth guard.  I like the high volume of vibrations (or whatever they are called) and I like the ultra violet light too.  I want the mouth guard to be as clean as possible and this certainly helps.  This is my second one of this model.  The last one lasted about 3 years and the vibrations started being intermittent and then stopped altogether.  I bought this one again because it had the three features I wanted:  plug in power (battery power is available if you want it), UV light and high vibration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I run it twice every morning - the second time, I flip the mouth guard over to expose the other side to the UV light.  (I also scrub first with soap and a toothbrush).  I saw another reviewer that mentioned using hydrogen peroxide to clean the unit and I&#x27;m going to try that.</li>
    <li> I bought one and it never worked when the power cord was installed. I ordered a second one and returned the first one. The second one worked for two weeks but now the blue light works but no vibration. I ordered a different brand.</li>
    <li> Had to return it, This thing doesn&#x27;t clean anything. Not dentures, jewelry nothing. I can clean better with a turd.</li>
    <li> I use it for cleaning my mouth guard and a dental &amp;#34;appliance&amp;#34;. It does an excellent job, my years old mouth guard looks better all the time.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a way to keep partial and retainer clean without using harsh chemicals. My dentist uses ultrasonic system. Am very pleased with size, convenience of no plug required and ease of use.  Works very well and looks like it will hold up for a long time.</li>
    <li> Machine runs well but it does not change the look of the mouth guard. Hard to tell if the guard is getting cleaned.</li>
    <li> More than what I expected.  Didn&#x27;t realize it ran on batteries as well as direct current.  Much more convenient for my living space.  The box it came in was the most secure packaging I&#x27;ve ever seen . . . so it arrived in tip-top shape.  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the product and would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> My husband got top dentures, because he doesn&#x27;t brush like he should. I bought this because he&#x27;s going to take care of his expensive dentures. (I mean it), this is simple for him to use, doesn&#x27;t take up much space, and I had to ask if he was using it because I never hear it from the bathroom. So pretty quiet. Thank you for helping me keep my husbands choppers clean.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a great job of getting the particles off but the UV does kill the bacteria and get rid of the morning breath</li>
    <li> great product.  cleans really well.  Very durable so far.</li>
    <li> the device is to small to clean both upper and lower dental plates at once.</li>
    <li> It works great. I use it every day. It helps keep my oral appliances clean.</li>
    <li> Some of the worst instructions I&#x27;ve seen. They say the &amp;#34;Power saver turns the unit odd automatically after 5 minutes on the UV + Ultrasonic Washing cycle and repeats the use of &amp;#34;odd&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; again. And, this statement isn&#x27;t correct, as it turns the ultrasonic feature off after 5 minutes, but the UV part keeps going for about 15 more minutes. I have no idea how you use the lid for the inner water container. You obviously can&#x27;t use it when feeding a toothbrush through the little door in the unit top. I just took it off entirely - don&#x27;t think it matters and it&#x27;s just in the way. I think I finally figured out that the ultrasonic feature (and maybe the UV feature) is working when it blinks yellow and green/blue alternately and only the UV feature is working when it blinks green/blue.&lt;br /&gt;The size of the unit is fine for my clear retainers but it would be too small to hold a full set of dentures. I like that it&#x27;s small and lighweight for my use. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine the quality of how well it cleans - only a few days. I&#x27;m still using my tablet cleaners in another container once a day as well too. I would rather just put the tablet in the water bath of this unit but don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s OK to do that or not. The instructions state to use only water so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing, but it&#x27;s not as convenient.</li>
    <li> The best cleaner for my mouth guard I have tried in three years. NO cleaners required with this. Just add water and it cleans your mouth pieces perfectly.</li>
    <li> To small for full upper and lower at the same time.</li>
