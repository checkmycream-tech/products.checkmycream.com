      <li>I did an internet search and othger sites were selling a smaller amount of this perfume for alot more money</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Calyx since it came out in the 90&#x27;s, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased the large size.  </li>

      <li>The scent is not over-powering, and the pricing on Amazon was very competitive.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years, and no matter what new frangrances I try, I always come back to my old stand by.</li>
      <li>I wear no other perfume except Calyx.</li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite fragrance, and I expected it to look like the photo on the left.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, it came in a plain cardboard box.  </li>
      <li>Subtle; clean.  </li>

<li> she just got last year for a gift , it was hard to find then, to find it at Amazon was awesome,,so needless to say ,</li>
<li> Hard to find this scent at the stores, so I always replenish from Amazon.</li>
<li> has been increasingly hard to find.</li>
<li> Or at least selling it at Macys ,, my wife dropped her bottle</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not yet September and the button that sprays the perfume is broken for whatever reason won&#x27;t push down to release The fragrance!!</li>
<li> Yes, seriously.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t care for heavy sickening perfumes or colognes.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
<li> I rated this bad because the smell disappears.</li>
<li> I have never been disappointed.</li>

    <li> The product arrived within a couple of days.  I&#x27;ve been wearing Calyx since it came out in the 90&#x27;s, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased the large size.  I could not have been more pleased. The package arrived in perfect order and the fragrance was exactly what I&#x27;ve come to expect from prescriptives.  [[ASIN:B001BR4J8K Calyx By Prescriptives For Women. Fragrance Spray 3.4-Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Love it! Worked the Prescriptives counter at large store   for several years---It was the best skin care and scent around.</li>
    <li> Just what she wanted. Need I say more.</li>
    <li> I love the smell it&#x27;s so clean and fresh and just plain amazing!  The best part is that I got it way sooner than I thought I would and I got it on my Birthday! That worked out well!</li>
    <li> My wife just love it!</li>
    <li> Love this one.....great value</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;ve purchased several times</li>
    <li> This is a knockoff.&lt;br /&gt;I know how this is supposed to smell.&lt;br /&gt;It smells ok when you first put it on but it disappears in less than 10 minutes!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Turns to a alcohol gross smell.</li>
    <li> My wife used this in high school.  I became the hero when I got this for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first after reading the reviews that questioned the authenticity of the product, but decided to give it a try.  Well...I should&#x27;ve listened to the warnings of other buyers...it has NO scent what so ever!!!! literally a greasy shot of spray with no fragrance...I&#x27;ve been using Calyx for more than 15 years and know the distinct scent but you don&#x27;t need to be an expert on this one...because it was as if I sprayed water on my wrist...</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN PURCHASING THIS FRAGRANCE SINCE 1989 &amp; WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE IT. I DON&#x27;T WEAR ANYTHING ELSE...NO DISAPPOINTMENTS HERE!</li>
    <li> My go-to scent for work. Almost a grapefruit but definitely a citrus scent.  Subtle; clean.  If someone is that close to smell anything (leaning over you looking at your computer screen; sitting next to you in a crowded auditorium, etc) they&#x27;ll pick up on it, and I&#x27;ll always get a compliment. Not like the perfumes that knock you out in the elevator with someone who dosed themselves. Hard to find this scent at the stores, so I always replenish from Amazon.</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of reviews I was  apprehensive in purchasing this however I felt I received a great perfume true to&lt;br /&gt;The department store.it arrived nicely packaged,and is great.This is the real deal,I absolutely will buy again.</li>
    <li> My Wife&#x27;s favorite.  So happy that Clinique took this over from Perscriptives.</li>
    <li> This has been my signature fragrance for YEARS! Now that it has been discontinued in the stores, I&#x27;m glad that I can purchase it here on Amazon. It&#x27;s a very floral fragrance &amp; I get TONS of compliments on it all of the time.</li>
    <li> The beautiful fragrance speaks for itself! The perfume is  fresh, fruity, light, and reasonably priced. You have to try it to experience the true pleasure!  June</li>
    <li> I bought this product in March it&#x27;s not yet September and the button that sprays the perfume is broken for whatever reason won&#x27;t push down to release The fragrance!! I am very very disappointed</li>
    <li> Still my favorite (exclusive) scent since 1993. Yes, seriously. Glad it&#x27;s available here.</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described. Shipped quickly undamaged.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother.  To my horror. .she says it absolutely does not smell like the real calyx.  I was very upset.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite fragrance, and I expected it to look like the photo on the left.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, it came in a plain cardboard box.  (???) It smelled just fine.  But, I was concerned&lt;br /&gt;about the box.  Grey goods? (sigh)</li>
    <li> I have used the fragrance for years.  I love it. It has a citrus like scent that is clean and refreshing.  I wear no other perfume except Calyx.</li>
    <li> I rated this bad because the smell disappears. You have to use the bottle every time you use the lady&#x27;s room</li>
    <li> I have worn this scent as a part of my &#x27;persona&#x27; for over 20 years... It has never ceased to be fresh and appealing.</li>
    <li> Love the product. The scent is unique. I have been using this perfum for years. I&#x27;m so happy that I can buy it thru Amazon and for a great price.</li>
    <li> At first I was a bit wary about purchasing this product online, but after receiving it, I was quite satisfied. Same product sold at Nordstrom at a much better price.</li>
    <li> My go to fragrance. Aways get complimented!</li>
    <li> I have been using Calyx for three or four years and really appreciate it&#x27;s light fragrance. I don&#x27;t care for heavy sickening perfumes or colognes.&lt;br /&gt;It has been increasingly hard to find. So, I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve been able to locate some for now on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this for girlfriend and bought one for Mom, and it was 20 dollars more at Macy&#x27;s and that was when they had a sale on it.</li>
    <li> This is a fragrance I love in the warm weather! I have been buying this for years! It has a fresh lively fragrance without being too strong.</li>
    <li> I just love this scent.  Light and fresh.  Great for anytime.  Just wish it didn&#x27;t fade out so quickly. I give it n A.</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrance since college (over 20 years ago).  People remember me from this fragrance, though having your husband&#x27;s college roommate being the best at remembering this may not be a good thing...</li>
    <li> I buy this annually as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She always smells nice, so I guess I love it.</li>
    <li> best price for the size.</li>
    <li> I loved this perfume. It as a great price for a substantial quanitity. I did an internet search and othger sites were selling a smaller amount of this perfume for alot more money</li>
    <li> I buy this several times a year and keep it in my desk.  When the time is right I give it to my wife making everything better</li>
    <li> I would tell all that if you love a fresh smelling frangrance, this is it. I have worn this for twenty plus years.</li>
    <li> When I wear this perfume I get so many people asking what I&#x27;m wearing . It&#x27;s not easy to find Calyx. It&#x27;s no longer sold in the Prescriptives department .They have their sales for Calyx with another cosmetic company. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it! It&#x27;s very light and never overbearing .Men are the ones that really compliment me on this scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tired of wearing Calyx and am frequently asked what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing. I always purchase this product from Amazon. I have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> Indeed, just what I was looking for , I understand they stopped making Calyx ? Or at least selling it at Macys ,, my wife dropped her bottle she just got last year for a gift , it was hard to find then, to find it at Amazon was awesome,,so needless to say , I bought another bottle for Christmas , she was very happy , fast , safe ,easy , thanks Amazon. : )</li>
    <li> Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the freshness and fruitiness of this scent. I have been using it for far longer than I would like to admit and always get compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume and it&#x27;s clean scent.  The only drawback is it doesn&#x27;t last a long time after you put it on and I find myself re-applying throughout the day.  But I will buy it again because I think the scent is fabulous</li>
    <li> Best summer fragrance EVER</li>
    <li> This product was originally by Prescriptives, and I have been using it for several years.  The scent is not over-powering, and the pricing on Amazon was very competitive.  Now if I could only find the Calyx &amp;#34;Sheer Exhilaration&amp;#34; as well...</li>
    <li> I love this scent and it is unfortunate that it has been discontinued.  I now have to find a difference fragrance once all these are sold out.</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance as a gift for my wife since she couldn&#x27;t find it at any of the local stores.  She was surprised and loves it.</li>
    <li> BEST SMELLING FRANGRANCE EVER MADE!  I GET A HEADACHE WITH MOST OF THE FRAGRANCES AT THE DEPARTMENT STORES.  THIS ONE IS VERY DIFFERENT--IT HAS A VERY FLOWERY/FRUITY SCENT, AND BEST OF ALL...NO HEADACHE! LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS FROM OTHERS TOO!</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this fragrance. It smells like a combination of citrus fruits and summer (even though I wear it all year around!).</li>
    <li> This is my \\&quot;tried &amp; true\\&quot; fragrance.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years, and no matter what new frangrances I try, I always come back to my old stand by.</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite summer scent.  It is light, but it lasts.  It has more depth than most scents with this fresh composition. I recommend it to anyone looking for something alluring and a bit different.</li>
