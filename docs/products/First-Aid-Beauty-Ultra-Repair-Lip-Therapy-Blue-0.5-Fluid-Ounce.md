      <li>Best stuff ever!!!</li>
      <li>But for somebody who doesn&#x27;t mind mint flavors, this would be the PERFECT product for them.</li>
      <li>Happy with this order, great price too!!</li>
      <li>It smooths the  lips beautifully.</li>
      <li>Great lip balm and</li>
      <li>I love this lip repair!!</li>
      <li>My lips, never felts so good and</li>
      <li>It has the best applicator ever, it&#x27;s so smooth, and lasts on me for about ~2 hours without me feeling the need to reapply.</li>
      <li>This product is wonderful - feels cool, not greasy at all</li>
      <li>the color of my lips were beautiful and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>LOVE this stuff!</li>
      <li>but I found it here with faster shipping I love it!</li>
      <li>This is top notch!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>I am so glad to find this product now on Amazon!</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s be honest...</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome, leaves your lips so soft and doesn&#x27;t have that sticky feel.</li>
      <li>Feels great and silky right when I put it on, but doesn&#x27;t repair my chapped lips.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more of this.</li>
      <li>i will buy this again when I need more.</li>
      <li>Perfect for people with super dry, chapped, and cracked lips like myself.  </li>
      <li>I found myself biting my lips more with it on, and it wore off very fast!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s free of toxic chemicals and petroleum.</li>
      <li>I should clarify that I only gave this four stars because it&#x27;s not my FAVORITE lip item, but it is in the top five, and that&#x27;s saying something!</li>
      <li>Feels great on chapped, dry lips.</li>
      <li>and I see a real improvement each time I use it :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got makeup bags full of lip products - yes, it&#x27;s an obsession.</li>
      <li>once you realize how much better it is than the normal stuff from the drugstore.</li>
      <li>At first of putting it on, the fragrance or natural oils are very light, light peppermint scent to it, and felt like just like another chapstick, because of the beeswax, but after 2 minutes, the pain had disappeared.</li>
      <li>And this does exactly that!</li>
      <li>Just okay product (for me) -- did adequate job, but does not really heal/prevent chapped lips --- is okay, but for the price I do not recommend ---</li>
      <li>Although no dyes or coloring are in it, my lips looked so supple and kissable, I can now smile as I type this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s so worth it</li>
      <li>I ran to Sephora, and was about to purchase Fresh&#x27;s SUGAR lip moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Went to work today and my lips became drier and at this point, I couldn&#x27;t smile or even talk.</li>
      <li>I had read such good reviews and maybe had too high of expectations.  </li>
      <li>First when I got it it was a great product but took about a week until I noticed a good difference of my lips not being as chapped, but I had to constantly re apply it probably about every 30 minutes to an hour, then it started coming out of the tube as a yellow color instead of clear and now when I apply it it doesn&#x27;t do anything except the opposite and making my lips chapped.</li>
      <li>Again, I got very fast relief.</li>
      <li>It gets absorbed readily into the lip</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t make-up, it&#x27;s first-aide and it really works!</li>
      <li>I found the First Aid Beauty line, and since I am already an avid user of their Ultra Repair Cream, I considered it (I didnt know that they had a lip product).</li>
      <li>First found it in the mommy and me section on Sephora website</li>
      <li>After a couple of months this product is pure oil.  </li>
      <li>But the tube is huge for a lip balm — this is going to last me for a while.</li>
      <li>Very unimpressed for the price.</li>
      <li>it shipped extremely fast.</li>
      <li>goes on like vaseline, but a much healthier alternative.  </li>
      <li>This really helps a lot.  </li>
      <li>I really like most of their other products, not this one.  </li>
      <li>It makes my lips super soft and it doesn&#x27;t bother my daughter sensitive new skin</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than other similar products that I have.</li>
      <li>It looks like I have a new pair of lips after 2 hrs.</li>
      <li>But, especially at nighttime, I&#x27;m always wishing that I didn&#x27;t have to apply so much!</li>
      <li>After only a couple days of using this, my lips feel completely renewed and super deeply moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Soft lips</li>
      <li>The cracked skin doesnt sting and the ragged edges are so soft.</li>
      <li>and my lips feel soft.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this in the past and it has been fine.</li>
      <li>I normally wear the chapsticks from Wholefoods and thought that was enough since it seemed natural.</li>
      <li>This is very average lip balm, and not at all worth $12.00.</li>
      <li>Last year I was placed on a high blood pressure medication, that is well known for causing the drying out of the ears and a dry cough, etc.  </li>

<li> Last year I was placed on a high blood pressure medication, that is well known for causing the drying out of the ears and a dry cough, etc.  </li>
<li> The only reason it&#x27;s not my #1 is because I tend to like my lip treatments pretty thick - if you don&#x27;t, this might be the one for you.</li>
<li> On my fingernail areas, I apply just a little and within a few minutes, it is absorbed and I don&#x27;t have to worry about greasy fingerprints.</li>
<li> I later began to use it around my fingernails, where these areas began to dry out and peel.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m just obsessed with having smooth, moisturized lips.</li>
<li> Just the other day, my lips cracked in the middle.</li>
<li> they are dry a lot.  </li>
<li> Sometimes my lips get so dry</li>
<li> I needed a lip aid to help with my dry chapped winter lips.</li>
<li> I spent months exploring one product after another for my ears, until the point they were so irritated they were bleeding.</li>
<li> This stuff adds no color (can be a plus or a minus), has no flavor (again can be a plus or a minus), adds no shine, but soothes immediately.  </li>
<li> After reading the label, it mentions that its not for damaged or cracked lips, so I immediately put it down plus the cost of it was $23.</li>
<li> or maybe I was coming down with something?</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the tube sent to me was VERY OLD and couldn&#x27;t even be squeezed out of the tube.</li>
<li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
<li> I will no longer waste $2-3 again for any brand of chapstick-like lip treatment again.</li>
<li> now I add a small drop just inside each ear in the morning and before bed, and this keeps the side-effects of the HBP medication at bay.</li>
<li> Had to get my money back :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Overall I was disappointed in it.  </li>
<li> I had never experienced that before.</li>
<li> Then my the end of the day, my lips were burning as if something caustic</li>
<li> The taste is bad and it oozes when used.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not one of those where the second it rubs off, you&#x27;re cracked and miserable again.</li>
<li> I was getting a miracle, but I was wrong.  </li>
<li> Put it on at night and there is still a trace of it in the morning with no dryness or weird crud build up.  </li>
<li> No more bloody lips for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Sometimes my lips get so dry I think they are going to fall off.  I&#x27;ve used lots of products over the years, and waxy sticks do nothing!  This stuff adds no color (can be a plus or a minus), has no flavor (again can be a plus or a minus), adds no shine, but soothes immediately.  Put it on at night and there is still a trace of it in the morning with no dryness or weird crud build up.  It isn&#x27;t make-up, it&#x27;s first-aide and it really works!</li>
    <li> I used every bit of it, which says a lot!! I&#x27;m a chapstick junkie. I will be purchasing more of this. I received it as part of a kit though.</li>
    <li> Keeps even the driest lips moisturized!&lt;br /&gt;Great!</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! It&#x27;s 100% the best lip balm that I&#x27;ve ever used. Let&#x27;s be honest...I&#x27;m a lip balm junkie. I probably apply about 20x a day. I&#x27;m just obsessed with having smooth, moisturized lips. But, especially at nighttime, I&#x27;m always wishing that I didn&#x27;t have to apply so much! I want a lip balm that I can put on before bed, and not have to retouch five times before I actually fall asleep. And this does exactly that! It has the best applicator ever, it&#x27;s so smooth, and lasts on me for about ~2 hours without me feeling the need to reapply. After only a couple days of using this, my lips feel completely renewed and super deeply moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is the scent. I have a thing against mint-flavored lip balms, so that&#x27;s why this isn&#x27;t a 5-star review. But for somebody who doesn&#x27;t mind mint flavors, this would be the PERFECT product for them. Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey. But the tube is huge for a lip balm — this is going to last me for a while. And it&#x27;s so worth it once you realize how much better it is than the normal stuff from the drugstore. I plan on repurchasing this stuff for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> Last year I was placed on a high blood pressure medication, that is well known for causing the drying out of the ears and a dry cough, etc.  I spent months exploring one product after another for my ears, until the point they were so irritated they were bleeding.

    <li> I should clarify that I only gave this four stars because it&#x27;s not my FAVORITE lip item, but it is in the top five, and that&#x27;s saying something! I&#x27;ve got makeup bags full of lip products - yes, it&#x27;s an obsession. This one works, and it works well. It&#x27;s soothing, and it actually seems to repair and hydrate instead of just covering up chapped lips. It&#x27;s not one of those where the second it rubs off, you&#x27;re cracked and miserable again. The only reason it&#x27;s not my #1 is because I tend to like my lip treatments pretty thick - if you don&#x27;t, this might be the one for you.</li>
    <li> I had read such good reviews and maybe had too high of expectations.  I noticed I was constantly putting this on my lips as it did not last.  I could of saved a lot of money and got a cheaper brand as I could not tell any difference.</li>
    <li> Just okay product (for me) -- did adequate job, but does not really heal/prevent chapped lips --- is okay, but for the price I do not recommend ---</li>
    <li> Feels great and silky right when I put it on, but doesn&#x27;t repair my chapped lips. I have to keep putting it back on several times a day. It tastes gross and has a vaseline consistency, so I don&#x27;t WANT to put it on repeatedly.</li>
    <li> My lips peel a lot. they are dry a lot.  Lipstick just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  This really helps a lot.  It gets absorbed readily into the lip so it does it job.  i will buy this again when I need more.</li>
    <li> This is very average lip balm, and not at all worth $12.00. Save yourself some money and try a tube of &#x27;Aquaphor&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this in the past and it has been fine. Unfortunately, the tube sent to me was VERY OLD and couldn&#x27;t even be squeezed out of the tube. There was also a blue permanent marker line drawn through the product code on the tube. Where is this stuff being stored???</li>
    <li> UPDATE: After a couple of months this product is pure oil.  It comes out runny and as a liquid.  The taste is bad and it oozes when used.  I would not recommend.  Stick to a \\&quot;stick\\&quot; product that won&#x27;t melt.  I thought spending $12 I was getting a miracle, but I was wrong.  Had to get my money back :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.  No smell or fragrance.  Perfect for people with super dry, chapped, and cracked lips like myself.  Simply a miracle.  No more bloody lips for me.</li>
    <li> Just the other day, my lips cracked in the middle. I had never experienced that before. I normally wear the chapsticks from Wholefoods and thought that was enough since it seemed natural. Went to work today and my lips became drier and at this point, I couldn&#x27;t smile or even talk. I don&#x27;t know what had happened. I was applying olive oil to my lips. It kept it moist and then it would sink in and disappear. Then my the end of the day, my lips were burning as if something caustic or maybe I was coming down with something? Mind you, I&#x27;m not the one to wear lipsticks, lick my lips or eat a lot of salt: something you would consider to be drying. I ran to Sephora, and was about to purchase Fresh&#x27;s SUGAR lip moisturizer. After reading the label, it mentions that its not for damaged or cracked lips, so I immediately put it down plus the cost of it was $23. I found the First Aid Beauty line, and since I am already an avid user of their Ultra Repair Cream, I considered it (I didnt know that they had a lip product). Thank the Lord I bought it. At first of putting it on, the fragrance or natural oils are very light, light peppermint scent to it, and felt like just like another chapstick, because of the beeswax, but after 2 minutes, the pain had disappeared. I went out to eat, had dinner, and reapplied. My lips, never felts so good and the color of my lips were beautiful and healthy looking. Although no dyes or coloring are in it, my lips looked so supple and kissable, I can now smile as I type this. The cracked skin doesnt sting and the ragged edges are so soft. It looks like I have a new pair of lips after 2 hrs. My husband tried it, and he likes it, too! Totally unisex and no offensive color or scent. I will be buying these as stocking stuffers for family. I will no longer waste $2-3 again for any brand of chapstick-like lip treatment again. This is top notch! Plus, they are local ~Newton, MA.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this lip aid and was glade too find. I use this lip aid at night. I dont like using oily balms or glosses when I sleep (acne prone). I needed a lip aid to help with my dry chapped winter lips. This product is wonderful - feels cool, not greasy at all and my lips feel soft. I would buy again and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this lip repair!! It&#x27;s free of toxic chemicals and petroleum. I wear it every night when I go to bed. It doesn&#x27;t have a taste.  Feels great on chapped, dry lips. I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great lip balm and it shipped extremely fast.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever!!! First found it in the mommy and me section on Sephora website but I found it here with faster shipping I love it! It makes my lips super soft and it doesn&#x27;t bother my daughter sensitive new skin</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than other similar products that I have. It has almost a minty smell, but it goes away instantly.</li>
    <li> It smooths the  lips beautifully.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, leaves your lips so soft and doesn&#x27;t have that sticky feel. Happy with this order, great price too!!</li>
    <li> Never sticky, this does what us claims to do! Soft lips and I see a real improvement each time I use it :)</li>
    <li> I really like most of their other products, not this one.  I found myself biting my lips more with it on, and it wore off very fast!  Overall I was disappointed in it.  Maybe we need petroleum in our lip product...</li>
    <li> goes on like vaseline, but a much healthier alternative.  read about it in my fitness magazinestill experimenting with it .  hope this is helpful</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Use it every night before bed, and can still feel it on in the morning.</li>
    <li> First when I got it it was a great product but took about a week until I noticed a good difference of my lips not being as chapped, but I had to constantly re apply it probably about every 30 minutes to an hour, then it started coming out of the tube as a yellow color instead of clear and now when I apply it it doesn&#x27;t do anything except the opposite and making my lips chapped. Very unimpressed for the price.</li>
