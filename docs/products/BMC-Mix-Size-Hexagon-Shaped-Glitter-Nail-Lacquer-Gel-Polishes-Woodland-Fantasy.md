<li> long lasting.  </li>
<li> This polish is really thick, it does stay on (without peeling) pretty well though.</li>
<li> with the exception of the blue and green, these all look the same.</li>
<li> I thought it would feel all rough and bumpy when finished like at the salons</li>
<li> As long as you apply it very thin, then it goes on pretty well.</li>
<li> This product was very disappointing, the colors are way off, it was clumpy, would not dry under a UV light.</li>
<li> The polish is a little thick, I dont know if thats normal, so it took a little longer to dry under my uv lamp</li>
<li> a little too chunky when trying to make an even finish</li>
<li> so I can keep it up when she&#x27;s not able to do it for me.</li>
<li> They are actually very thin and have to be worn over solid color.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too thick.</li>
<li> They are too thick and tge polish goes on clumpy.</li>
<li> This polish is VERY thick.</li>
<li> of the bottles had thin layers of cured polish inside&lt;</li>
<li> The glitter is flat and not that scratchy annoying type at all.</li>
<li> I had also bought the pastel colors by BMC (I forget the name of them) and was very disappointed</li>

    <li> This are supposed to back Christmas present for my daughter.  I got into them while she is away for the wknd. I absolutely love them. My nails look like they were done professionaly. The polish is a little thick, I dont know if thats normal, so it took a little longer to dry under my uv lamp but it is worth it. I will buying more.</li>
    <li> These are great! I was actually surprised how well they stayed nice. I had also bought the pastel colors by BMC (I forget the name of them) and was very disappointed so naturally I thought these would be the same. NOPE! It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and they still look great!&lt;br /&gt;*The first picture is when I first did them and the second is two weeks later (please excuse the regrowth) :D 😆👍</li>
    <li> These are really pretty colors. They look awesome over top of another!</li>
    <li> Peels of very quick. It&#x27;s too thick.</li>
    <li> These work just like suggested they were beautiful</li>
    <li> with the exception of the blue and green, these all look the same.</li>
    <li> Great quality, exactly as described, fast shipping. Will definitely order from this company again!</li>
    <li> This polish is VERY thick. As long as you apply it very thin, then it goes on pretty well. Here are a couple of pictures of my nails with this polish on.</li>
    <li> This polish is really thick, it does stay on (without peeling) pretty well though.</li>
    <li> This product was very disappointing, the colors are way off, it was clumpy, would not dry under a UV light. I would return it but I don&#x27;t have the packaging it came with. I do NOT reccomend.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really thick which I thought would be a problem, but it wasn&#x27;t and the colors are very pretty</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I love these lines of gel nail polish is.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE COLORS....VERY CLASSY AND LONG LASTING!!</li>
    <li> this polish does Not stay on well would not buy again</li>
    <li> These colors are awesome. Soft, semi transparent and good quality. Great size to try Mia&#x27;s products, You won&#x27;t be sorry. The acrylic flows nicely. It dries a bit slower but hardens nicely. Lasts until next fill.</li>
    <li> I was expecting these to look like the pictures when I painted my nails. They are actually very thin and have to be worn over solid color. Would not have purchased if I knew that.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great service. I gave it a 4 star because I dis not like the brush. They are too thick and tge polish goes on clumpy. I found a thinner brush which makes it more even.</li>
    <li> I love this polish! It does take several coats but since it cures in 30 seconds is no problem.</li>
    <li> Pretty colors, the pinks look identical though. The packaging acppeared to be new, however they are extremely &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; compared to the sands of Aruba bmc set I got (which I love, by the way). Maybe they were opened???? I won&#x27;t buy the bmc glitter polish again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick, which is fine with me...&lt;br /&gt;but very &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;couple of the bottles had thin layers of cured polish inside&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got the returned item from someone else?&lt;br /&gt;Two orange color looks the same</li>
    <li> Also delivered so fast. I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I really love these nailpolishes. The colors are great - just as pictured. When I finished doing my nails they looked salon quality. The only problem is that they start peeling off after a week. But they look great before that.</li>
    <li> a little too chunky when trying to make an even finish</li>
    <li> I bought this polish for my DIL for Xmas, she&#x27;d just got her manicurist license. She tried it out in my nails &amp; we both loved it. I came back to buy another set for myself so I can keep it up when she&#x27;s not able to do it for me. Love it! Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, packaged nicely, and works perfectly. The polish I put on has so far lasted a week and I&#x27;m waiting longer to see if it&#x27;ll make it to two weeks.</li>
    <li> arrived in a very timely manner.  beautiful colors.  long lasting.  the only reason it did not get a 5 star is the color does not show any where on the bottle  just the name.  you have to open each bottle to find the color you want.</li>
    <li> This worked out great and was an awesome price.  The glitter is flat and not that scratchy annoying type at all.</li>
    <li> Very nice glitter a little big than I expected but they can work</li>
    <li> Love the pastel colors</li>
    <li> Great colors and the sparkle is just right. I will buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors and lasted for 3 1/2 weeks!</li>
    <li> These polishes are so glittery and beautiful! I receive many complements whenever I wear them. If you like glitter, this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, wonderful colors, only needed one coat. The color is only on the bottom on a sticker and my stickers were falling off from arrival.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.. I thought it would feel all rough and bumpy when finished like at the salons but it is nice and smooth.. Me and the grand daughters have fun on girls day!</li>
    <li> So far I love it, but lets see how it comes off.</li>
