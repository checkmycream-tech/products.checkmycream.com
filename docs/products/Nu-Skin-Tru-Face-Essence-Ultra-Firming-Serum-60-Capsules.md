<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nu Skin for years.  I prefer the 180 system for anti-aging. However, when you use the 180 system along with the firming serum the results are quite dramatic. You can besure that I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
    <li> If there was only one product you could buy for firming the skin then this is it. I am 59 years old and do not want to have a LA lift or any other type of face lift.  This product will give you firmer and even a feeling of thickness to your skin because of the ageLOC and ethocyn.  Its molecular size is very small which allows the product to go deeply into the skin down to the dermis where we need it in order for our skin to change.  I also felt the hydration level of my skin was much better and texture greatly iimproved. Feel free to email me for more info s.antos@comcast.net. If you want this at below wholesale I am happy to help.</li>
    <li> I know someone who sells Nu Skin and talked about how \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; they were.  So I snuck off toe Amazon to see for myself.  I didn&#x27;t notice one iota of difference.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I only got 59 capsules! What&#x27;s the deal here?!</li>
    <li> Good product but very expensive.</li>
    <li> Products are great, fast shipping</li>
    <li> A few month age, I used 10 Capsules from a friend of mine. Those were great for my dry face skin during the winter. So, I ordered a case from Amazon. I have used this case for one month. Everything is good and it is cheaper. Definitely, I am going to order more.</li>
    <li> This product has amazing results! Expensive but worth it! I use it every morning for 10 days then I alternate every other day.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product and was prepared to order it again.&lt;br /&gt;However I just noticed it has increased in price by $10 in one month?&lt;br /&gt;Makes me hesitate to do further business here.</li>
    <li> seems to have diminished my lip line and eye wrinkles - WHEN use in conjunction with the daily Vitality and R2 supplements - and other good facial moisturizers etc.</li>
    <li> It works in long run but the product is kinda pricy. I would like it if they can lower the price...</li>
    <li> Using this product for over 2 years now.&lt;br /&gt;Love how it keeps my skin young.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 49 and people think I&#x27;m 40 (genetic or the serum)?&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;m not taking any chances ;)</li>
    <li> My skin has never looked better, since using this serum!  My friends keep asking me what I am doing different!!</li>
    <li> I got it on time. Perfect and no complaint. The service was excellent</li>
    <li> Very, very soothing serum. Sinks right in and feels healing. I really love it and not drying so you can use under eyes. Cheaper on amazon than thru my skin.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s expensive - makes my skin feel won derful what more can you ask.</li>
    <li> I initially purchased this from a Spa, liked it so much I bought it directly through Amazon.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this item from a Nu Skin Distributor and use it for weeks. I don&#x27;t see much of improvement of my skin at all! I backed to my previous skin care and it&#x27;s working much better! Nu Skin it&#x27;s rediculous priced!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nu Skin&#x27;s Tru Face Essence Ultra and now ageLOC Tru Face Ultra, if I were limited to only once product for the skin on my face, neck and hands, this is it. The reformulated TFEU with ageLOC is great and shows an improvement right away. I know, I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 6 months. It&#x27;s the only product that targets the aging processes at the genetic level. I have it. I use it. I&#x27;m a very happy \\&quot;middle aged\\&quot; woman, because it appears my chronological age is now truly \\&quot;just a number.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> delivery was on time and I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell how much it helps and if the expense is worth it.  Why do they put it in separate capsules?  I&#x27;m sure it helps to make it more expensive.</li>
    <li> Very good product, still not as potent as the new one, not yet on the market. I was lucky to try it for a month and I am waiting for it...but expensive. Now compare to others on the market of course it could be considered okay and excellent. they are the best &amp;#34;pearls&amp;#34; I wish for. If I could use 4/day my skin would be delighted, I am so dry, that would be a great help for me.&lt;br /&gt;I love it ...Try it you might not do without!</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous! I use this protect product daily. It is a fabulous way to hydrate my skin. I use it along with other products by nu skin to keep it very moist. It has even helped my skin renew itself.</li>
    <li> Can see very little results even thought it was supposed to be fabulous!  I won&#x27;t make the mistake of buying this again!</li>
