      <li>Really cheap and was hard to take off of the packaging.</li>
      <li>cheap made and hard to put on</li>
      <li>I had to pull the wire apart a bit to get them &amp;#34;screwed&amp;#34; into place, but they stayed put in my thick but silky fine hair through active dancing until I gently &amp;#34;unscrewed&amp;#34; them out of my hair.  </li>

<li> They arrived much earlier than I expected so</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not really complaining.</li>
<li> I figured it out, they stay in if your hair is up &amp; somewhat tight.</li>
<li> Came a lot quicker than I thought, but after playing around with them for a little bit I am still unsure how they&#x27;re suppose to stay in your hair.     </li>
<li> It is a little difficult to place in hair, especially if hair is loose.</li>
<li> , I&#x27;ll just use what I have :/</li>
<li> its too hard to twist it in the hair...</li>
<li> I need them badly</li>

    <li> This a very pretty product. It looks just like the picture. The shipping was a lot quicker than it was suppose to be. I was impressed by this. It seems to be very well put together. It is a little difficult to place in hair, especially if hair is loose. However, it works very well if your hair is up and someone is helping you (let&#x27;s face it, we can&#x27;t always see and reach around our hair the way we like, but this is not the products fault.) I can&#x27;t wait to use these for my upcoming wedding!</li>
    <li> These little twisty things make my daughter&#x27;s hair fabulous! My daughter had taken a keen interest in hair accessories and everywhere she goes with them, she is getting constant compliments. They are really easy to put on, just twist onto your BRAIDED hair.&lt;br /&gt;My package came with no damages and got all 12 twisty things. There was one that had visible orangey glue, but its not that noticeable.</li>
    <li> These were great accents to wear in my updo for a special occasion--I have silver gray hair and prefer more subtle hair adornments but these were perfect.  I had to pull the wire apart a bit to get them &amp;#34;screwed&amp;#34; into place, but they stayed put in my thick but silky fine hair through active dancing until I gently &amp;#34;unscrewed&amp;#34; them out of my hair.  Slow and gentle turning makes them easy to remove.  I look forward to wearing them again.</li>
    <li> Sturdy! and a beautiful hair accessory!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten to use them yet, but they look just like the picture, came on time. No problems yet. Looking forward to using them.</li>
    <li> Look great especially to dress up hair . They were very easy to use in long hair or short hair .</li>
    <li> Really cheap and was hard to take off of the packaging. They were cheap so I&#x27;m not really complaining.</li>
    <li> These look great in my girls hair. They come out fine you just have to twist them out not pull them.</li>
    <li> They make any hair do look elegant, very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> These were absolutely perfect! My daughter wore them in her hair for my older daughter&#x27;s wedding! Stunning!! The price was the best that we found anywhere!</li>
    <li> My mother had these when I was a child and I wanted to wear some when my daughter got married so I ordered these.  They arrived faster than scheduled and were well packaged and of great quality.</li>
    <li> Came a lot quicker than I thought, but after playing around with them for a little bit I am still unsure how they&#x27;re suppose to stay in your hair.     EDIT - AHA I figured it out, they stay in if your hair is up &amp; somewhat tight. You may have 4 stars now, carry on.</li>
    <li> They look good twirl on nicely but some of the &#x27;pearls&#x27; came off. I need them badly so I am not returning any, I&#x27;ll just use what I have :/</li>
    <li> My bridesmaids look so elegant and beautiful with these in their hair!</li>
    <li> Pretty but they didn&#x27;t want to stay in my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have not quite figured out yet how to use these lol - but they are very cute.</li>
    <li> I wore these for my wedding, and they stayed put throughout the entire night up to about 4 am. I got compliments at the salon about how good these looked, they really brought out the hairdo, and made it more distinguished. I noticed it also looked beautiful in the pictures.</li>
    <li> cheap made and hard to put on</li>
    <li> I love them..they will be great for my hair on my wedding day very happy with the clips..will look great</li>
    <li> These hair pins turned out very pretty! They arrived much earlier than I expected so that was great too! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Love these hair clips though I got fake diamonds than the pearl ones. I thought they would get tangled in my hair but they don&#x27;t as long as you are consistent with which way you screw them in!</li>
    <li> its too hard to twist it in the hair... might as well buy the hair flower picks... its ok for the price..</li>
    <li> Perfect for the occassion. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> For the price, these little things are great! They twist in easily and the color is pretty solid! I even bought two packs-at seperate times so I know it wasn&#x27;t just that batch-but the quality is good and I think they&#x27;ll last me awhile if I treat them nicely!</li>
