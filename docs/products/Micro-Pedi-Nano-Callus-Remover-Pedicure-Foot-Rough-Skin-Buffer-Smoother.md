    <li> best product to get your feet ready for flip flops</li>
    <li> OMG I love this thing! No more crusty feet! I am a Californian and never wear shoes and when I do, it&#x27;s flip flops so my feet take a beating! This thing is just as good (if not better) than my pedicurist! I gave another one of these to my mother for Christmas as well and she&#x27;s in love too.</li>
    <li> Does an awesome job!! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these for myself a few months ago and loved it so much I ordered it for a gift for someone I know will love it too.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of different foot files and products to remove callouses, but some of them tempt you to take off more than what you should at one sitting.  This pedicure product is extremely easy to use and only takes off what should come off so that you can touch up later in the week if necessary.  You can see your dry skin flaking away!  Or if you use other files after soaking your feet but they feel too rough afterwards, combine your pedicure with this product afterwards to make your feet feel really smooth.  You can buy different roughnesses of files to use with it, too.  Also, the batteries seem to last forever.  I use this every week and I don&#x27;t remember if I have ever changed the batteries in 5 months - if I did, it was only once.  It&#x27;s light weight and easy to pack in a suitcase to take on your vacations and use before heading to the beach.  Buy it - you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really useful and handy</li>
    <li> its not amazing as the reviews suggest. Kinda have to use it at least every other day. we&#x27;ll be how i feel after ive been using it longer</li>
    <li> It does a good job but what you can&#x27;t see is the roller head is covered in the back.  So you don&#x27;t have full around access to roller.  Probably should have ordered their other style.</li>
    <li> I bought this last summer and I love it. I will never go back to using pumice. This little guy is amazing. After a few uses my feet are beach ready after a hard New England winter. I just bought another one as a gift. I did have to replace the roller after a season but was able to find the replacements on Amazon that were very reasonably priced. If your feet need work before you put on flip flops give this a try. It leaves my feet baby soft. After six months in boots that a tall order!</li>
    <li> So happy with this purchase and will certainly recommend it to my friends!  W. McKinnon</li>
    <li> I cannot find this item I may have received it, but I don&#x27;t recall.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just has ONE sided &amp; must maniplate item back &amp; forth on one side. Seen items that can use it both surface.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product. It is one of the best things I ever purchased. My feet look fantastic and ready for my summer sandals. The Mirco Pedi Nano fits perfectly in your hand..I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like it. I have very bad heals and this does a great job. My husband even uses it on his heals and elbows. We ordered a second one for my father in law.</li>
    <li> Got this and I&#x27;ll never go back to the manual device. Easy to hold for someone with small hands. Leaves your feet baby soft.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! Had it for 3 months. It works great! I got the wider on because I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, &amp; is easy to hold. I had a bad callous on my heel, that was hurting very bad. It took several uses to get rid of it, but it did. I even use it on my husband&#x27;s feet. He loves it too. Make sure you clean the Pedi rollers really well &amp; it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> works great, well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product!  It works great!!</li>
    <li> My Nano is wonderful...my feet have never been so soft! Softer than a baby&#x27;s butt!&lt;br /&gt;I gave one to my grandaughter who is 15 years old, she loves it..no more calloused feet from bare feet.</li>
