<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gillette Mach 3 are great razors and these were at a fantastic price.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product, gad to find as Costco no longer carries and said folks now prefer ones with batteries or roller ball action</li>
    <li> These razors work great and are very smooth on the skin. I have tried many blades and razors from different brands, but always come back to Gillette. Gillette has some of the longest lasting sharpest razors money can buy. I like this format as it contains six disposable razors - however, disposable is a relative term as these really lasts many shaves to make them feel semi-permanent.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re OK, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy them again.  They feel light and insubstantial, not a big chunk of metal like some other razors feel.  Shave is fine, nothing to rave about.  The green slimy stuff lasts about 8 or 10 shaves, then is gone, but the razor lasts me a lot more shaves before it&#x27;s too dull to use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll look for a razor that has a more substantial feel to it.</li>
    <li> I have this set to a 3 month recurring send, and one razor easily lasts the two weeks you need to space each one out for. Keeps the razor changing consistent, and just when I think I&#x27;m out of blades, more show up! Great for people trying to keep recurring costs down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good consistent product, you can&#x27;t even tell their disposables until you inspect them up close (no way to remove the blade) Handle is nice and sturdy, and it feels like the full featured mach 3, except that it always looks new because it is!</li>
    <li> This product cuts close, but is non irritating to the skin thus I don&#x27;t cut myself --as often-- because it glides over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is more sensitive now so it requires something that will make the blades glide across my face without causing friction or skin irritation from harsh perfumed chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got disposables incase I leave loose it on a business trip I don&#x27;t have to buy another handle to fit replacement blades, I kind of use things for a long-long time.&lt;br /&gt;So I  didn&#x27;t want to have to worry about having a bunch of replacement blades and having the handle wear out from use thus these handles aren&#x27;t sold anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me Disposable is better</li>
    <li> Best razors out there no pulling and they are nice and smooth giving you a great clean shave .  I will buy them again.</li>
    <li> Gillete Mach3 is the best shave ever! It features a protective Microfins help avoid nicks and cuts from the shave.</li>
    <li> Product arrived safely and as scheduled</li>
    <li> This older model blade is very, very good, and I still use them.  I do think I can do as well with other blades from Harry&#x27;s or Dollar Shave Club and save a little money.  But, this is a great blade and I continue to use them.</li>
    <li> I really love these razors. They are sharp and best of all, for me, they do not irritate my face like the cheaper three-blade cousins do. And to top it off, they seem to last for at least 15 shaves. I shave every other day, so that&#x27;s a month.</li>
    <li> The BEST razor you can get. Hands down. Smooth, sharp, long-lasting and nearly impossible to cut yourself with it. I&#x27;ve used everything imaginable in terms of razors.... electric, disposable, safety, straight, etc. etc. All things considered these are simply the best. Worth every cent. Trust me on this one.</li>
    <li> These work great for him and I and the delivery to the door ensures we do not run out!</li>
    <li> Not Bad, but not as good as expected</li>
    <li> The Gillette Mach3 Disposable, Sensitive, is in mont ways, the best razor I&#x27;ve found.  The comfort and overall maneuverability of the design are wonderful.  I am able to easily get a great, close shaving angle on my cheeks, neck, and chin, plus the blades are consistently sharp and smooth.  I can count on this razor to give me a close, comfortable shave without great effort or the need to shave some areas several times to catch what escaped the first, second, third passes with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with this razor involves difficulties shaving right under my nose.  I can&#x27;t seem to make the razor catch those whiskers without the scary prospect of inserting part of the razor head into my nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> i use razors forever. These dont get dull and work for like 10-15 shaves for me. The shave is really good for a disposable and I dont get cuts because the razors are on good springs. Its just like a mach 3.</li>
    <li> I used the Mach 3 disposable and refills for the longest time because they were just that good.  I am not much for brand loyalty but when I started to use these, I stuck with them for several years because they were everything I wanted in a razor - effective, durable, and inexpensive in either completely disposable or cartridge form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Mach 3 was the latest evolution about the late &#x60;90s that introduced three blades for perhaps the closest and smoothest shave a man (and [[ASIN:B0039LMTBU woman]]) could safely get.  Before this, I had stuck the two-bladed [[ASIN:B00EBA1T46 Sensor Excel]] series that got me the same results but struggled somewhat with my then irregular shaving habits.  As a Mexican-American male (though perhaps it&#x27;s more to my family&#x27;s genetics) with healthy skin, I grow large patches of stubble on my cheeks with denser patches and thicker hairs growing under my nose and chin.  I shave regularly but not everyday so I can average about three days worth of stiff stubble in between shaves that the Mach 3 would cut through like a hot knife through butter - with my shaving routine, I would go with and against grain passing the razor over my face four times for a soft smoothness that is usually reserved for women&#x27;s bodies. The open design (you can see through the three blades) not just rinses out well, it dries out faster and more thoroughly, limiting the effects of corrosion. About the only negative about the Mach 3 is not unique to it - the simple steel composition does wear down eventually but it breaks down pretty quick but the not the way you think.  While the average life my Mach 3 razors was about three months, there was distinct feel between smooth and effortless next-to-the-last shave and the last shave that would pull individual hairs, leave behind stubble, and cause nicks. Of course, shaving is a very subjective experience and your results will vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, the Mach 3 should be the first for consideration for those that want to move on from the generic, stiff, and less than three blade designs that some men and women have resigned themselves to use. While the disposable version is great any pattern for shaving, the refillable cartridge stands out for its performance of results and longevity for both men and women.those that want to move on from the generic, stiff, and less than three blade designs that some men and women have resigned themselves to use.

    <li> No problems and a great value!</li>
    <li> very good. i am very happ with these and the price is right. the head moves a LITTLE too much for me, but i got used to them. would buy again..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mach 3 a long time, and it&#x27;s pretty good.  Unfortunately, it irritates my skin pretty badly, but so do all razors I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I would definitely buy the Mach 3.  Gillette razors are unparalleled when compared to the competition.  Plus it is cheaper than the the higher class razor.</li>
    <li> These cut you and don&#x27;t last as long as regular blades. Enough said. I don&#x27;t usually review products on Amazon but don&#x27;t want anyone else to waste their time on these. Just get the regular Mach3 cartridges, which work fine.</li>
    <li> The razors may be decent but this package is typical last century thinking. It&#x27;s one of those plastic things that require siccors and a knife to open. Most companies have stopped using this sort of thing. Gillette needs become aware of the new technology.</li>
    <li> My go to shaver, I. Shave head and face, a d each blade last for at least a month.</li>
    <li> My husband uses these on his bald head to keep it shinny.  It is the best razor he has used</li>
    <li> It was a gift and he thought it was regular refills.</li>
    <li> I got six packs of six razors each for less than fifteen dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe a mistake but is a bargain ! Now to see if they shave well?&lt;br /&gt;The reviews were good !</li>
    <li> For my face...better than proglide, Schick, or other razor brands</li>
    <li> These are the real deal. Not being a European woman I like to keep my legs and underarms free of any unsightly hair and this brand of razor is the only one I have found on the market that is sharp and stays sharp for a long time. The Lady Schicks I was using don&#x27;t compare. Men will also love these because of the same reasons. Sharp, sharp, sharps and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mach 3 for 15 years and I won&#x27;t switch to anything else. I have very little problems with cuts or razor burn and it does a great job with my thick beard hair. With the build in lubricating strip, I don&#x27;t even use shaving cream. I&#x27;ve tried cheaper blades and they cut the crap out of me, and I don&#x27;t see any need for fancy vibrating blades or pivot heads when these do the job just fine.</li>
    <li> Dull razors that are clearly not made by Gillette, I have used Gillette razors daily for the last 12 years, one usually lasts about a week, these razors are duller than a razor after two weeks. I will never buy razors on the Internet again.</li>
    <li> Each one lasts me for 6-8 shaves and I have a heavy beard.</li>
    <li> The Mach3 was introduced by Gillette in 1998 and I&#x27;ve used them since then when I haven&#x27;t had a beard or used an electric. I&#x27;ve tried alternative blades, including old-fashioned double edge blades, and although I resist buying and using the Mach3 because IMO the cartridges are way overpriced (one source says the cartridges cost 9 cents to produce, yet they typically retail for around $2.30 per cartridge), I always return to the Mach3 because it gives me the cleanest, most consistently bloodless shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking now at the Mach3 I bought back when they were introduced side by side with a Mach3 disposable, and if there is any difference between the actual shaving heads, I cannot detect it. I don&#x27;t know if handles that hold Mach3 cartridges are made the same as they were when I bought mine, but my old one has some metal on it and is heavier than the disposable, which is all plastic and rubber. The handle of the disposable is fatter than that on my old Mach3, making for a somewhat more comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this 6-pack of disposables because with Amazon&#x27;s present special offer (a $2 e-coupon that is applied at checkout) the price per unit is only around $1.80 each (compared, as I say above, to an average price of around $2.30 per cartridge). When I use these up I&#x27;ll look for the best price I can find on Mach3 cartridges or disposables and will purchase whichever is cheapest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These disposables have clear covers over the blades, which slide off and can easily be slid back on, making them especially handy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, after shaving for around four decades with various shaving foams, I discovered Aveeno shave gel and have used it ever since. A little bit goes a very long way so I don&#x27;t worry about the price, and I find the Aveeno gel/Mach3 blade combination perfect for my face and fairly dense and tough beard.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a cheap alternative to expensive replacement cartridges. Here is a trick...you can gently pull the blade off these and use in on your Mach 3 handle.</li>
    <li> Got tired of buying refills, so I now use these.  Works well and good price.</li>
    <li> I have been using the first razor for over two months, and still going strong.</li>
    <li> Provides a great shave without any irritation.  I always have problems with disposable razors and irritating my skin, these never do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much tried just about every razor on the market at one time or the other, both cartridge and disposable.  I&#x27;ve tried Proglide, Remington King Of Shaves, Schick Hydro, Gillette Fusion, Schick Quattro to name a few as far as cartridge razors are concerned.  I&#x27;ve tried alot of disposables as well, ranging from any Gillette, Schick, BIC, Wilkinson and etc.  Out of all those brands, me finding this Mach 3 disposable razor was the best thing I could&#x27;ve used.  I have real sensitive skin, so just using any razor will leave me broke out and razor burned.  I was in the routine of using the Proglide series products, with the Proglide Styler as my main razor.  Unfortunately, lining with the Styler is a major hassle and headache.  Plus, like many who use the Proglide cartridges, I hate the fact that the blade only lasts for 3 shaves.  The commercials would have you believe it&#x27;ll last up to 5 weeks, but that must be for guys who either don&#x27;t have tough beards or stay clean shaven.  As for me, paying $20 every 2 weeks for the replacement Proglide cartridges was getting too expensive.  Plus, despite me using all the Proglide series product, the actual Proglide was still leaving me with quite a bit of razor burn.  So, I finally decided to keep the Styler for my body hair, but found the Mach 3 disposable razors and decided to try them.  I previously tried them a few years ago, but at the time I thought they were a bit expensive.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth they were and one disposable razor will last 5 shaves(which by comparison to the Proglide is 2 shaves better).  In addition, price wise the Mach 3 was $14 for 6 razors(once again beating the Proglide by 2 razors and being $1.50 cheaper) and I noticed I have little to no razor burn with the Mach 3 disposable razors.  While I still use the Proglide series other than the Mach 3 razor, I&#x27;m glad overall that I made the switch to the Mach 3 disposable razors.  It&#x27;s far superior to the Proglide in every way, including both sharpness and being better for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one potential negative I could see for some people would be the cost, but if you&#x27;re using the Proglide, then this still winds up being cheaper.  Plus, I prefer disposable razors since they usually can line facial hair better and you don&#x27;t have to snap replacement heads on and off.  In the long run, I find this product to be the most effective for the price and quality.  I&#x27;d recommend this razor to anyone not using an electric razor...sharpness and being better for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one potential negative I could see for some people would be the cost, but if you&#x27;re using the Proglide, then this still winds up being cheaper.

    <li> Received this package the other day and it was as described.  I must say, even though these are throw away razors, they are excellent quality.  They shave well, they have are sturdy and they are priced cheaper than the local Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> They do the job... I just wish they stayed sharper for a longer time...</li>
    <li> Just about as good as the regular Mach 3s.</li>
    <li> Last a long time, smooth,  and good for travel</li>
    <li> I used to use the non disposable Mach 3 and actually prefer these disposable razors. Close shave and&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I expected a sensitive shave since I love the non-disposable Mach 3 razors, and I was excited that there was a coupon. However, this razor is only good for one shave before it started to dull and practically rip my skin apart. Back to the regular Mach 3 cartridges for me.</li>
    <li> Overall good deal, but blades do get duller faster than the regular Mach3. Overall satisfied with the purchase though.</li>
    <li> I can not blame everything on this razor. I have sensitive skin and have not found a razor yet, that allows me to shave with out severely breaking out. The disposable razors are solid, no nicks and a smooth shave. It may work for some people, so I gave this review 2 stars. Otherwise, they did not work for me</li>
    <li> maybe the best disposable I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Update as of 7/13/15 - My original review was incorrect, the heads DO come off. There is no button like my Mach 3 razor to release the head but if you pull, it will come off. Upgrading to 5 star rating as this is a money saving item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying this disposable pack was cheaper then buying just the pack of blade refills. The &#x27;heads&#x27; of these razors do not come apart like traditional Mach 3 heads, so having these is a bit bulkier and takes up more space in my medicine cabinet. It might sound insignificant but I am married so I automatically have only 10% of all available space in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would buy the traditional refills if the prices were the same, but I will keep buying these so I can save some $.</li>
    <li> IN MY CASE, 1 BLADE WORKS FOR ME EVERY MONTH.</li>
    <li> Just does the job, comfortably.</li>
    <li> The razor has a very poor blade angle for males. Doesn&#x27;t allow for clean shave in certain areas of the face.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Mach3 Disposable Razors build on the classic Mach3 design, but for the budget or on the road crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the same razor as if you were buying the cartridges. I went to the disposable for a couple of reasons. One: I hate giving Gillette my money. What they charge for the simple, cheap action of shaving each day is criminal. This is in part to why I never changed to the Fusion razor. Why pay more money for shaving when the original does the job. Two: Really, same as one. I wanted to find a cheaper option for shaving. The disposables are a little bit cheaper than the cartridges and buying them on Amazon is a little more cheaper. Not tons, but a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Still pretty expensive when compared to Dorco razors. What I&#x27;ve found is the Mach3 is smoother than Dorco, but so much depends on what type of shaving cream you use and your skin type. Using a crappy shaving cream will yield you a cut up neck regardless of what razor you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Disposable Mach3s are the way I&#x27;m going in the future (with Edge shaving cream). Finding the right price at the right time is when I&#x27;m going to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 5 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;Recommended: Yes, but find what is right for you.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best razor I have used in my 40 years of shaving (I&#x27;m 42; just kidding)...</li>
    <li> it so good. Get set of six in low priceses. The quality is good, easy to use and received on time</li>
    <li> I recommend.  Equivalent to store bought products.  Nice to have delivered to door rather than having to find  a &amp;#34;Sales Associate&amp;#34; to open a locked case.</li>
    <li> I like the Mach 3 razor and usually buy blades for the razor. When I saw these disposable razors at a reasonable price, I thought I&#x27;d try them.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It gives a good shave, my last almost a month (I have a soft beard) and they work well, fitting the contour of my face well.&lt;br /&gt;I still think that razor blades are a huge racket. They charge inflated prices and keep adding blades and features trying to convince the public that they&#x27;re getting something special. I&#x27;ve bought generic blades for my Mach 3 razor in the past, but this time, they have discontinues them on their website. I suspect they had violated some patent and were forced to stop. I&#x27;m seriously trying to get used to a single razor blade just like my Dad used for many years. They work well, are a little more likely to cut you, but are low priced and give a good, close shave..</li>
    <li> Shaving quality as good as Gillette refills for the original razor. Could provide more quality shaves for the price, but still compares well to the original.</li>
    <li> Great deal real razors</li>
    <li> Pretty damn good!&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t bother spending more on the Mach4...the Mach3 does the job well and they last a decent 3 weeks per razor.(Depending of course on use frequency)</li>
    <li> description is shotty. I was just wanting to order disposable blades for my mach 3. These are actual cheap disposable blades with connected handle.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this 6 pack from the advice of my roommate, and couldn&#x27;t have made a better call. I used to use a Gillette Fusion Proglide Power, and I can honestly say that 5 blades is over kill for your face. 3 is the magic number! I will be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> For the same cost, or sometimes less than the actual refill cartridges, these are a total no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;They last just as long, and I don&#x27;t have to always worry about packing my handle. Great value.</li>
    <li> I used to buy the Mach 3 cartridges. They were getting so expensive that I switched to these disposable shavers. I feel they are much better and last much longer than the cartridges-at less cost. Great for travel too.</li>
    <li> No doubt these things are expensive, but they are still cheaper than Walmart, especially after free shipping. I use these razors to shave my head, and they are the only shavers that really work for me, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried cheaper versions. Now if only they would last longer...</li>
    <li> These razors are a good buy, like I said it&#x27;s smooth aqnd easy on my face. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t spend any more on pro-glide. I switched to these and they work better for me. They&#x27;re also drastically cheaper. I have really sensitive skin and these work awesome.</li>
    <li> great product/gr8 price/overall purchase experience, it met met my expectations :-)</li>
    <li> Great price for these razors.</li>
    <li> Good razors.  Gillette makes the best ones, but are usually way over-priced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m tired of buying women&#x27;s razors that seem to last 3 weeks, stay sharp after only 2 uses, and can never seem to get rid of hair after I run water over the razor. I decided to try a &amp;#34;man&#x27;s&amp;#34; brand of razors and went with these. They do the job, and after using a few weeks they are still sharp. They also feel a bit heavier in my hand than a normal women&#x27;s razor, which I like. Sidenote: It&#x27;s stupid for razors to be separated by gender.</li>
    <li> These are great rangers! It is a lie that women have to use women razors. The guys have it right for four blades do the job!</li>
    <li> They arrived on time.  They are handy and convenient as disposable ones.  Somehow they are not as sharp as I imagined. For the price, they are good but not very good.</li>
    <li> I started to buy these while traveling, so that I don&#x27;t have to bring my DE safety razor, brush, etc. along. They are very lightweight (good/bad), but provide a nice shave. For their purpose, I like not having a special handle to keep track of--I can just toss the entire unit at the end of a trip, or dry it and save it for the next one.</li>
    <li> These razors are horrible. They are not sharp, do not give me a close shave at all! The first time using this razor,n the shave it game me was as if the razor had been used for months. I ended up getting razor burn because I had to keep shaving over the same spot a number of times...not recommended at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using the first of the three I purchased.  A little spendy but they provide a very close shave and last and last.</li>
    <li> These average a little more than $2 a razor when ordered on Amazon, compared to Mach3 cartridges that go for about $4 a cartridge at Costco.  These work as well as the cartridges, so that is why I have stockpiled a bunch.  Get them before they are gone!</li>
    <li> Works great and provides a close shave</li>
    <li> The razor seems decent, but I am finding I cut my face with it.  I haven&#x27;t had this issue with other safety razors.  Will update rating if I learn to use it better - not sure if I should blame Gillette or myself on this.</li>
    <li> As promised, these are the disposable Mach threes. But they work great and they leave my face Honcut and closely shaved. Great deal</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using these disposable razors. It is becoming a bit harder to secure recently. Perhaps they are being phased out. They have just the right balance of shaving ability (smoothness and precision) and balance in your hand. They are first rate disposable razors far above competitors like Bic.</li>
    <li> Good price on a great product.</li>
    <li> I have used the Fusion [5 blade] battery powered for years but find these disposable 3 blade units the best for travel, and plan to use them in South Africa later this year....a truly great product</li>
    <li> The best and closest shave ever.</li>
    <li> Thought about the single edge that the pawn stars are promoting. After reading reviews on all types of single edge razors I went with the Mach 3. Extremely happy. Great shave. Blades are spaced enough where gunk doesn&#x27;t build up making cleaning and multiple uses a breeze.</li>
    <li> These have worked the best of the disposable blade options sold by Gillette.  They seem to be very similar to the Mach3 Turbo but now called Mach3 Sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Blades seem to be sharp and well positioned&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Price is very high for these disposable razors.  Costco or Sams Club usually have larger packages with better pricing.</li>
    <li> These Gillette Mach 3 Sensitive Disposables are great! The price was great, also! Having this many, at this price, seems to last forever! It is so much better than buying 1, or 3, at a time! I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> okay for a disposable - but still not real good&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been stuck using worse disposables that were so flimsy they shredded my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is better in a pinch, but no way would I ever use it if a I didn&#x27;t have to</li>
    <li> Perfect alternative to the real Mach 3 razor blades.  I use these for traveling and they keep working well for me.</li>
    <li> It makes great shave with very little effort. I find it even better than the regular Gillette Mach 3. Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is probably my fault,  but I thought that I was just getting attachments to my normal Mach 3 razor. These are actually full disposables razors (with handles).</li>
    <li> I usually buy some cheapie brand from Target.  Some of them are really terrible.&lt;br /&gt;I admit this product worked surprisingly well.  And the blade has stayed sharp MUCH longer than the cheapie brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!</li>
    <li> I like the Mach 3 line from Gillette. They give a clean, close shave. I&#x27;ve been using the refillable models for ages, but having lost, misplaced, etc the handles while on the road, I&#x27;ve decided to try their disposable models. I love filling up landfills, it&#x27;s so American. But.....they give as long of a shave (for my daily, six shaves) as I get from the refillable.</li>
    <li> Nice shaves, blades seem to last longer than other brands -- would recommend these!!</li>
    <li> Been using these to shave my legs for years. Getting the disposables is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Could not pass this up when it was on-sale - great blades and it allowed me to try out the new &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; model - thanks!</li>
    <li> Never run out o razors, son loves it.</li>
    <li> These are basically the same price as buying just the refill cartridges for the Mach3 (still the greatest razor ever made). Difference is, with these, if you lose your razor, no big deal. There&#x27;s five more where that came from, and you don&#x27;t need to fuss with carrying cases and swapping out cartridges. These each come with a replaceable plastic cover over the blades so they&#x27;re perfectly fine to just toss in a bag when you travel. However, these are still more expensive than they need to be, and for that reason, I am considering joining dollarshaveclub... very tempting. But these are still solid.</li>
    <li> I have used this type of razor for many years and have always been pleased with the results I recieve.  I look forward to the same service from this 6-pack of disposable units.</li>
    <li> One razor can be used for 2-3 weeks depending on the frequency of use. The blades are sharp and does a nice job. It gives a comfortable shave and reduces irritation after shaving.</li>
    <li> believe me each blade could be used for 3 months. i feel for the first one month its very smooth. second month too its the best one and for the third month i feel its good to be used....its just like go on and on and on and on until it breaks.</li>
    <li> I have switched to these disposable blades for the lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very happy with the quality and how long each razor seems to last.&lt;br /&gt;Almost just as good as the regular blades but at a much lower cost.</li>
    <li> Not as good as Fusion.  Too many bloody cuts and short blade life.</li>
    <li> These Gillette razors are great, but you get what you pay for, which is top tier quality. These razors glide across my face effortlessly leaving no razor burn on my face, when shaving on the neck I almost never get razor burn with them. For their price they are a little expensive, especially for disposable razors, but they have best in class performance to show for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other razors from Bic, which are solid, but I&#x27;ve gotten some intense razor burn from Bics, so I use Gillette razors instead now. Most Bic razors are a few bucks less, so you save on cost, but they don&#x27;t match the Mach 3 on performance, not by a long shot.</li>
    <li> I have literally tried them all out there. While I like the Proglide it is absurdly expensive. This gives me a fantastic shave, very very close. I have sensitive skin and have winter eczema (dermatologist actually recommended this disposable Mach3 for sensitive skin). You can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon Prime here with free shipping to boot! I will continue ordering these for sure.</li>
    <li> Good price, works well.  Don&#x27;t understand why these are cheaper than the replacement blade cartridges, but that&#x27;s how it works out and that&#x27;s why I bought them.</li>
    <li> These have been very slick for me so far. Great design and fits in the hand well. Doesn&#x27;t feel like a super cheap disposable like some can be like that. Easy to wash out and has provided me with close shaves.</li>
    <li> This is definitely NOT a smooth shave, the cheaper disposable are smoother. Well not be buy this stuff again!!!</li>
    <li> for the price, these are the worst set of razors I have ever used. Purchased these on a whim because of the mach3 name. These are no where near the quality of excellent mach3 fusion razors (my favorite). These are like BIC cheap. Will cut your skin and barely last for the second shave.</li>
    <li> These razors give a nice, close shave. I have noticed that if you&#x27;re not careful that you can cut yourself without realizing it. I guess it&#x27;s just the way they&#x27;re made. I don&#x27;t have that issue with the other Gillette razors.</li>
    <li> Great razors at even better price.</li>
    <li> I despise shaving, but I can honestly say that out of all of the razors, this is the best. I am prone to ingrown hairs, and my Indian waxing lady told me to start buying men&#x27;s razors.... I&#x27;ve never touched another pink razor again.</li>
    <li> Much better than most disposables</li>
    <li> Husband love this brand. He&#x27;s used these for years and loves them. It was a great price and we received them fast with prime.</li>
    <li> This is the only razor my hubby uses. he loves it but it costs around 3 dollars per razor at safeway . so we come to amazon.</li>
    <li> Great Razors, better price the replacement heads for the Mach 3. I get 5-10 shaves from each depending on how often I shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my chin daily for 50 years now and have never enjoyed it much, to say the least.  Actually, there was a ten-year period when I wore a full beard, and not having to shave was a relief every single morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the decades, I saw new razors come and go, including double-edged blades with dials in the handle to bend the blade in the middle and change its angle of attack, etc., etc.  All the new ideas helped about as much as bell-bottom pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a Mach3 disposable showed up in our house a few months ago, I think mainly because it was the only thing on the shelf with the limited retail services around where we live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pleasant surprise: the Mach3 disposable lived up to the \\&quot;glide\\&quot; image and its head adjusted like a champ.  What used to bother me was practically gone.  Just wow.  I almost don&#x27;t mind shaving any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t know whether the Mach3 disposable is the best, but I tried a less expensive imitation and it didn&#x27;t cut it.  I gather from reading around that the latest great things are of doubtful cost-effectiveness.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll change.</li>
    <li> feels great on legs, no chafing, but it doesn&#x27;t get the job done as nicely as id hope and it cut me ):</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have incredibly think facial hair so I like the sensitive razors. they are not prone to cutting you and feel nice to hold, they get a close shave and that&#x27;s all I wanted.</li>
    <li> Subscribe and save product that&#x27;s cheaper here than in the drug store.  My husband really likes these. I love his close shave and these shave close!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to last to long, but a good close shave.</li>
    <li> Best shave in a long time.</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift for my dad, it&#x27;s perfect for his sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Smooth and clean shave.  I love these razors!</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my boyfriend.  They are not as long lasting as the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; razors according to his expert opinion,  And he has been using the Mach3 for over a decade.</li>
    <li> I find these as good as the more costly Fusion blades. These disposable ones are nice and lightweight and enough for a few months use.</li>
    <li> gives a good close shave without razor burns</li>
    <li> I bought these on autoship for my husband for Christmas, so he has a regular supply all year long. He loves them.</li>
    <li> love these they work amazingly</li>
    <li> Thought they were refillable blades for my Mach3 but they are disposables. Tried one and works fine so I didn&#x27;t return them.</li>
    <li> I hate this product. Seriously, I wish they had give this product some other name than &#x27;Mach3&#x27;. Its been almost 10 years I have been using Mach3 and never looked for another product. Some days back I lost the razor :( So, I decided to give disposable Mach3 a try. It is nothing like the original. Its not smooth, as a result leaves a burning sensation after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These fixed head disposables beat the quality of the replaceable head system in my experience. Cuts better and is easier to handle. The loose hinged head type cuts me occasionally but these fixed head lightweights never do.</li>
    <li> A lot cheaper than the same product in store. Overall, Good Value for Money. Highly recommend this product for others.</li>
    <li> They shave my face. As expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor with added protection</li>
    <li> Awesome experience, highly recommended, very fast delivery</li>
    <li> My new favorite travel disposable. The head is an actual Mach 3 cartridge. Exact same thing. And the handle is decent quality too. A must buy.</li>
    <li> Ouch, these blades are really bad! razor burns all over my face from the very first use. I tried another hoping the 1 blade was a fluke, and same results, Ive had A LOT BETTER experiences with knock offs and generics. my face is loaded with ointment now, gawd these are bad! stay clear from these or you will end up like me, My face looks like it got herpes people!, lmao!!!!!</li>
    <li> More junky razors at a foolish price.  I was hoping for better.  My beard is not heavy at all, yet these things struggle to give more than one adequate shave.  They&#x27;re not &amp;#34;mach&amp;#34; anything.  And if &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; means &amp;#34;dull&amp;#34; then these are the razors for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mach 3 for years.  Why improve on perfection?  Now that they are disposable it&#x27;s even better.  I dry mine off after every shave and that tends to make them last longer.  I change about every month and have sensitive skin.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I will never buy the mach 3 cartridges again. For just about the same price you can get the disposable entire razor itself so no messing with the handle part that gets messed up after awhile anyway. I&#x27;ve already tossed mine away and I&#x27;ll be using these from now on.</li>
    <li> I have been using them for 3 years now and got some for my father in law the last time I went to India. He loved it too.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> They are awesome and very sharp and each lasts for a month before I use the second blade</li>
    <li> These razor blades are durable, and quite transportable. Love it for traveling! I have re-used a single razor for about 10 shaves before it lost its sensitivity. Great!</li>
    <li> These dull after one use and will nick u up big time if u come back for seconds.  Avoid at all costs can&#x27;t believe they put the Mach name on this crap</li>
    <li> I first bought these because I needed razors. I love Mach 3, always have, but kept getting sick of the expensive price for the blades. I found these disposable ones (for less than a similar pack of blades only..believe it or not) and then found I could save even more by purchasing them on Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; feature. I now get them every 3 months, right at my doorstep, for around 13 bucks.</li>
    <li> Like the 3 blades. Light and easy for close shave. I&#x27;ll buy more. Great to trim around close areas. Gillette has sharp blades.</li>
    <li> As a veteran shaver of 52 years, I&#x27;ve seen disposable razors evolve from one-bladed BIC&#x27;s to four-bladed Schick&#x27;s.  But NONE of them can hold a candle in terms of shaving ability, quality and gentleness to this Gillette Mach3 Disposable razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette has been first-and-foremost almost exclusively, since before I was a little tyke in the Dark Ages, in the business of helping people remove unwanted facial and body hair .  And they are still here!  That alone is a testimonial to the quality and effectiveness of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specifically, the Gillette Mach 3 Disposable is very ergonomic, extremely gentle on my sensitive skin, and shaves like a sonofab--ch!  It removes your whiskers and any other unwanted hirsuteness clean, easily and very thoroughly.  I am prone to cuts by razors (diabetic) and I have NEVER been cut by one of these, even if I hold it at a bad angle on the shower, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish I could buy these in bigger quantities than a 6-pack because I would stockpile them for the day they will no longer be available like so many other great products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the very BEST disposable razor, forget all the others - buy the Gillette Mach3 Disposable; you will be very happy you switched!</li>
    <li> I love the Mach3 blades. For years I bought the replacement heads, but this is a great value for the disposables.</li>
    <li> Over priced buy Harry&#x27;s or Dollar shave club</li>
    <li> Review says it all.  I shave my head and these were not suitable.  I will stick with my Mach 3 replaceable blades.  The handles are too light to put any weight or pressure on the shave.  My suggestion?  If you want to get some extra life out of them, pull the blades off of the plastic stem and they attach onto the replaceable handle.</li>
    <li> these are very good razors</li>
    <li> Very comfortable shave....fits great in your hand.</li>
    <li> first time user of these and I love them, very close shave and no nicks!</li>
    <li> No more searching the stores for the favorite disposable razor!  The shave is close without irritation.</li>
    <li> These are good for women. Most men&#x27;s raisers are better than women&#x27;s and they last many shaves of the legs and under arms.</li>
    <li> Just don&#x27;t work good for me.</li>
    <li> I pick this up on sale with the coupon.  The razors Do a good job for the price but thats to be expected when it comes to razors most work about the same so it comes down to the value factor.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these razors only problem is now his sons are loving them too.  Guess we will have to stock up</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> i really like these because they give me a better shave than i have had in a long time.  since they are OEM, they are better than the disposable head knock offs i have purchased on ebay</li>
    <li> I like it however the heads are really small and light, keep this in mind because its difficult to use if you shave your head, i used it as a secondary shave after shaving with a bulkier blade like the Gillette Fusion 5 blade. I cant imagine this shaving a week old beard unless you trim it first with an electric trimmer like a peanut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used any other razors than these because they&#x27;ve been very reliable. I got these disposable ones because the replacement blades are expensive. One razor lasts quite a long time for me as my facial hair is not that thick. Go Mach3!</li>
    <li> I have tried several different brands of disposable razors, all do a satisfactory job but these seem to last much longer, getting more shaves per blade with these, will stick with this brand</li>
    <li> These are my husband&#x27;s favorite kind of razors.  They were very nicely priced and are all gone.&lt;br /&gt;Need to order more.</li>
    <li> Have been shaving since before there were such things as twin blades... much less razors with three, four or five blades. Tried electric, but they irritated my skin and cleaning the heads was such a pain.  Tried non-disposable razors too, but the cost of the unit and replacement blade heads was ridiculous. With the coupon deal that Gillette has on these Mach3s right now, bringing the unit cost under two bucks, I&#x27;ve stocked up with enough razors for at least a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First purchased a Mach3 disposable on a business trip when I forgot my regular shaver, and found it really wasn&#x27;t bad... much less costly than the non-disposable, and a decent shave. After that I tried other disposables from companies like BIC and Schick, and even tried other Gillette models too, but none gave me the smooth, no-nick experience that these Mach3 razors do... so I keep coming back. Now I don&#x27;t even bother trying others anymore; the Mach3s are for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these just for shaving my beard area and have fairly thick, tough stubble, and one razor typically lasts three to four weeks or so. The best combo for me is using this razor with Edge Sensitive Skin gel shaving cream, as it produces a good, clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From time-to-time a pack might have a razor that is seemingly just not as good or as sharp as normal, and you can tell those right away (I just toss them away). Maybe one such razor out of every 15 or 20 (maybe happens once a year or so?). That&#x27;s a pretty good average i think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a disposable razor of this type and style for use similar to what I have described, then I&#x27;d recommend that you give these Mach3s a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy, well made razor. I like that my razor bumps are going away and that this product is helping that. I like that there are 3 blades also. This razor is more expensive, but its worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my father in law.  Needless to say he loved it and uses Mach 3 all the time!</li>
    <li> These shave exactly like the non-disposable version. It&#x27;s difficult to review a razor, since everyone&#x27;s face is different. I&#x27;ll touch on some points of interest, though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good: It&#x27;s disposable. I am a bit of a neat freak, and the idea of touching a razor that has been in the bathroom for twelve years more or less disgusts me. I&#x27;ll always go the disposable route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good: These slide so smoothly that I can just about shave with the grain without any shaving cream. Do I do this on purpose? Oh, of course not. But I couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: The strip at the top makes the blades slightly wider than a normal disposable. This causes me an issue trying to shave right below my nose. This can be solved by being very, very careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good: These last me a long time. I shave 2-3 times a week, and I&#x27;d guess the razors last a month each.</li>
    <li> I like these razors i reorder when I need them</li>
    <li> Very good. I was hoping to use the heads off this item on my vibrating M3 unit, but couldn&#x27;t see how to get them off intact. But this is quite usable as-is.</li>
    <li> great and it works too</li>
    <li> these are excellent razors...well balanced...smooth and steady.....these are 3.50 per each razor unit...same size package at local drug store.....I noticed some reviews on other Gillette products saying some felt they received fake razor blades...these were the real deal..</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Gillette is a well know brand. Not very sharp when using. I have to go over the same area several times to get a good close shave.</li>
    <li> I saw a lot of complaints by others about this product and I have used it for years and this box was exactly as good as the last set. Works like a champ and delivers a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> GREAT SHAVE!! I&#x27;M A WOMAN BUT RAZORS ARE FOR ANYONE. I FARE BETTER WITH MEN&#x27;S RAZORS. I JUST SHAVED MY LEGS W/O ANY RAZOR NICKS WHICH I ALWAYS SEEM TO GET WITH WOMEN&#x27;S RAZORS. PRICE A LITTLE HIGH BUT WORTH IT. FAST SHIPPING.I RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> Better than the newer Gillettes with more blades.</li>
    <li> Great blades for the money.  I often take the heads off and use them in my permanent Mach 3 razor.  For whatever reason the handle angle is different on these vs. on the normal Mach handles you buy with disposal blades.  You can snap the blades out though and they fit your regular razor.</li>
    <li> These are the best.  I buy them for my husband and I.  they work better than the lady shavers.</li>
    <li> Fine blades with no flaws in the packaging whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Awesome pack of razors for a cheap affordable price that gets the job done. Sleek and clean shave, good for men with more sensitive skin. The Lubrastrip wares out way faster than the blades is my only complaint, but I hardly care. They are so cheap compared to other razors today.</li>
    <li> I got these for my husband&#x27;s Christmas stocking and he LOVED them!  Said they lasted longer than the traditional Mach3 blades typically do.</li>
    <li> price was ok and the quality is very good, i usually suffer about irritation but so far this razor has been very good.</li>
    <li> The product is great - no more cuts and smooth and close shave every day. I really love this product.</li>
    <li> I have never had a razor go dull/wear out so fast.  I usually get 1-2 months of daily shaves off other brands Ive tried.  These after 2 days the moisturizing strip is worn off and it somehow changes the angle so the blades do not work as well.  After a week it is starting to rust.  I keep my razors in the shower where I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know most people would say \\&quot;How do you get 1-2 months off a razor\\&quot;.. but I do.. I only switch them out because I feel like it or drop/break it.. not because I notice them getting dull or cutting harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**1 month followup** My first razor was useless after a week, it rusted and felt harsh.  The second one is 3 weeks old and hasn&#x27;t started to rust yet so I&#x27;m still using it, but it does not work as well as my previous razors.  The handle is poorly designed and becomes slippery too easily so the only place to hold it steady is right at the neck once it gets wet.</li>
    <li> good and sharp razors for shaving.</li>
    <li> Much better than other disposable razors. Not just because it has 3 blades, but probably they are of better quality.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT.. WORKS FINE ..... good.. was the same i want it love it good shape and product for me is ok</li>
    <li> Now is more than 8 times i have used one Razor and still it is looking good. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> We love these razors.  I used to use women&#x27;s razors and I hated them.  They did a poor job and always caused cuts etc.  So I started using my husband&#x27;s razors.  They worked so much better.  We love these because they work great and they last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever used. I have used the mach2, mach3 turbo, mach3 cartridge and Schick power hydro 5. The disposable razor last as long or longer than the same cartridge razors and they are cheaper. I always get a good shave, minimal nicks and cuts, and the price is as low as you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look in the Sunday paper a lot of times they offer buy 1 get one free on the disposables and you cant beat that deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the new razors out there, I have found this older \\&quot;simpler\\&quot; razor works best and saves me money.</li>
    <li> One of the best 3 blade disposable razors I have used. Never a nick and always a close cut shave.</li>
    <li> So, I have a Mach 3 Turbo razor and I got tired of spending an arm and a leg for replacement blades. I decided to try these out. I am completely satisfied and blown away by them. You can use one over and over and it takes a long time before you have to throw it away. I was thinking that since they were disposable razors that they would be not as good. As far as I can tell they basically the same as Mach 3 razors except they have a cheaper handle. I would definitely recommend giving these a shot. Save your money on these instead of paying way too much for replacement blades.</li>
    <li> its awesome. gives wonderful experience and smooth after shave skin. no itching or cut. it has been Value for money</li>
    <li> Plus :&lt;br /&gt;Gives clean smooth  shave&lt;br /&gt;Every disposable razor lasts at-least a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus:&lt;br /&gt;Still unsuccessful to find a razor which does not cause bleeding near my chin.</li>
    <li> best shaver for a disposable.</li>
    <li> I got these as a stocking stuffer.  I don&#x27;t know the cost vs the kind that attach to the permanent razor handle but they shave the same as that kind.</li>
    <li> Was thinking about ordering blades for my Mach3 frame but these were every bit as good a really pleased with them.</li>
    <li> My husband was very happy with them! Not what he expected...He would get them again when needed. I&#x27;ve used them too!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it is sharper than the Mach 3 cartridges but it definitely is and keeps its edge for many days.</li>
    <li> They work, and last awhile, and like everything else made by Gillette, they are overpriced.  I mostly use one of the better Panasonic electrics, which is very good, but these still give me a really close shave about once a week, which lasts a couple of days.  Also good for head shaving about twice a week, so handy to have around.</li>
    <li> These are ok. I&#x27;m not sure why blade quality isn&#x27;t what it use to be. I was getting a full week of shaves out of my blades a few years back. These days I only get about 3-4 shaves, then the blade is really dull and pulls and nicks. I don&#x27;t think they are using the same quality of steel, or they aren&#x27;t getting them as sharp. I guess that sells more blades for them. I won&#x27;t do disposables again, I thought I was purchasing refill cartridges when I clicked the button. There wasn&#x27;t a picture. Next time I will read the description better. I just don&#x27;t like throwing all of the plastic in the garbage every few days or so.&lt;br /&gt;These do give a very nice close shave the first few times. Smooth and clean. They just don&#x27;t last long for me.</li>
    <li> I have bought these 5 times now. Much cheaper than I can get them locally. At somepoint, how many blades do you really need on a razor? 5,6,17? For me 3 blades is more than sufficient for a close shave, and I even dry shave with these sometimes. They hold their edge for around two weeks for me personally. If you keep them in baby oil when not in use, they wont get rusty and last even longer.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Gillette has a good reputation and these were a replacement for non disposable razors that were&lt;br /&gt;also Mach 3.  i like these better.</li>
    <li> These are a comfortable shave and despite the cost per unit, they tend to last a long time (month plus) so on a shave by shave basis quite inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Will last all year.  Quality and price</li>
    <li> I guess many women don&#x27;t think of using a man&#x27;s razor for shaving their legs...but this one is brilliant.  Glad I was able to stock up with a 6 pack for the Spring/ Summer months.  Sorry Venus...but I believe I have found a replacement with Mach3 razors.</li>
    <li> Same razors you can get in many department stores but cheaper. Good deal, good quality, real Mach3. Each razor lasts me through at least 12-15 shavings staying sharp enough.</li>
    <li> I like it.. it is smooth and clean! no scratches and marks on chicks! I would highly recommend to friends!!</li>
    <li> Love these!  I actually get less cuts than I did shaving with my Mach 3, these are a great value!</li>
    <li> Good shave, but don&#x27;t last as long as regular Mach 3 cartridges. The lubricant strip is very good, however. Pleased with value for the price.</li>
    <li> This an outstanding disposable razor that gives a smooth, close shave. The rubberized handle is user-friendly as you deal with water required to prepare your face for shaving. When I travel, I carry one for trips of up to week, and it shaves as well on the last day as it did on the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good disposable choice.</li>
    <li> My mom got me a set of these. And they were just sitting in the closet in my bathroom for months. And tonight, I finally got around to use it. After the shavings, my face started to bleed in one spot. And it itches in all the other area where I had facial hair. Never again</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, what more can I say?  This is a waste of my time.  all these reviews that nobody even reads.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t shave with anything else and great value!  Gillette should have stopped at Mach 3 - this is the perfect razor</li>
    <li> I used to shave with the Pro Glide, but a friend suggested I try the Mach 3 again. Wow, am I glad I tried these. No one needs more than 3 blades. I have very coarse hair they grows very fast and these give me a great shave. Also the blades are spaced further apart, so it is easy to rinse while shaving. They are also more reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> All these expensive razors are a joke. This works great and trust me I have had all the other ones.</li>
    <li> Have purchased before, and will do so again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to a vibrating Mach3, and these just don&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut the mustard.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very cost effective way to get a Mach 3 shave, which I still think is the best razor around for the price (the 4 and 5 blades do no better and are more expensive).  My only beef is that these disposable blades and handles are cheaper than just the replacement cartridges, despite having more expensive packaging and certainly more material used in production!  Wish they could find a better way to do this, maybe making the handles more easily recycled, or bringing other prices down to appropriate levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than Walmart so I picked them up here.</li>
    <li> great disposable razors</li>
    <li> Dont try it. It was like second hand. Likes used stuff not recommend to anyone. It is really hard to believe that this is a gillete brand items.</li>
    <li> This is a great man&#x27;s razor.  The handle is of sufficient size and construction to provide a good grip and the shave the razor head provides is smooth and effective.  I don&#x27;t see how anyone could be dissatisfied with this product and I will be ordering more in the near future.  However, as a caution, and if you choose to try it, just be sure you are getting the Gillette Mach3 and not the Gillette Sensor3. The latter has a somewhat shorter and lighter handle which I didn&#x27;t care for as much and I suspect many other guys will feel the same way.</li>
    <li> Getting harder to find these - I hope Gillette isn&#x27;t discontinuing them. Costco dropped the bulk package last year and Walmart only sells the 3 pack. These are actually the &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; version (despite the package photo). No big deal - the only almost imperceptible difference is the lube strip.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money. Stick with the original Mach3 replacement cartridges. These don&#x27;t shave worth a darn! Worthless! OK maybe a bit exaggerated but these are no Mach3! Shame on Gillette. I found these on Amazon for a bit cheaper and thought a Mach3 is a Mach3 right? Not the case here. It takes me twice as long to shave and after I&#x27;m done I have missed spots all over my face. I&#x27;ll have to give these to my wife.</li>
    <li> For throw away disposable shavers this is the only Shaver out of all that is out there that I can get 6 shaves out of one razor. I have a heavy beard and it works every time. After the 6 th shave it will pull on the beard then ya know time to pull out a new one.</li>
    <li> Great product. I automatically buy it</li>
    <li> I have tried the 5 and 6 blade expensive razors and this old but good 3 blade disposable still gives the best shave.</li>
    <li> Used to buy these at Costco until they stopped selling them - best disposable razors I&#x27;ve found</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying replacement blades, but these work just as well. If you want to stretch these out, you can probably shave for months with one razor, and it will still work well. It&#x27;s nice to have a few of these around for different travel bags.</li>
    <li> I have tried many blades and this is my go to brand. I feel as if the blade stays sharp longer and I love the design.</li>
    <li> Best razors available. PERIOD!</li>
    <li> Great razors.  To me they work just as good as the individual cassettes.</li>
    <li> I have used them before. They work fine.</li>
    <li> I bought these a couple of months ago. They are excellent, the same as normal Mach3 blades, which are my preferred shaving tool. In fact, mistakenly I expected them to be just the blades (to attach to my handles), and it turns out these are disposables that come with their own plastic handles. That way they are ideal for travel or the gym - just toss one in the toiletries kit. I am very happy with them. Next time I will order just the blades - I expect they would cost a tad bit less :)</li>
    <li> For a disposable razor, coming from the days of 500 pc. bags of BIC POS&#x27;s...these are so much better.  One thing to keep in mind, as long as you practice proper care and cleanliness with you razors...these will last a LOT longer than the use strips on the top indicate.</li>
    <li> The open head design makes these razors very easy to wash out during use. Triple blade feature blades are good quality and  sharp allowing razors to be used atleast 2-4 shaves making it a good value for disposable razors.</li>
    <li> EXPENSIVE,BUT,QUALITY</li>
    <li> I have to say it: LMAO as Gillette converts it&#x27;s Mach3 into a disposable and advertises it&#x27;s prowess as being better than the Custom Comfort3 disposable razor...which is also made by Gillette!  If the best you can do is say your new razor is good because your other razor was always a POS you ain&#x27;t got much to say:)&lt;br /&gt;Go buy the Schick ST2 on sale here at Amazon.com, three bags of one of the best disposable razors ever made at $0.43 per razor that will do a better job than any Gillette disposable.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this dull light weight.</li>
