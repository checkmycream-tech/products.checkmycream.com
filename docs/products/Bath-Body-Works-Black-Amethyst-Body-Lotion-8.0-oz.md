    <li> I bought this because I needed lotion and I love the Black Amethyst body mist. But I thought this was a bit strong. I like my lotion to compliment my different body sprays/be versatile with my body sprays or at least not overpower it and this does overpower it. Unless you&#x27;re wearing the Black Amethyst body mist with it. Then they go together well. Other than that I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
