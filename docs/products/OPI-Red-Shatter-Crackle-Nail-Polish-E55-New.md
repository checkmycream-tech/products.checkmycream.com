      <li>THIS IS.A VERY PRETTY POLISH OVER MOST SOILD COLORS.</li>
      <li>--not all colors work well with all Shatter polishes, so it is important to experiment with one finger before you commit to both hands.  </li>

      <li>Would appreciate any suggestions from anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Now to be fair the color of pink they showed wasnt in stock</li>
      <li>So much fun to do nail art.</li>
      <li>the polish its self is a nice red though.</li>
      <li>It idnt look as nice over pink as the picture showed.</li>
      <li>I LOVE  RED</li>
      <li>A pity, since I really liked it the first time I used it.</li>

      <li>RED IS MY FAVORITE COLOR.</li>
      <li>I bought the first one in a set and used it once.  </li>
      <li>This shatter color looks great over just about any other solid nail color.  </li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
      <li>It was delivered in a very timely manner but as for the color, I&#x27;ll pass.</li>
      <li>Like all Shatter polishes, the color really changes depending on what you put underneath it</li>
      <li>This product works really well.</li>
      <li>I really like Shatter.  </li>
      <li>i have only used this on a tester finger as a trial, the shatter effect is quite unique</li>
      <li>haha  WOW!!</li>
      <li>Still have yet to find a combo that will make this look decent.  </li>
      <li>THE RED SHATTER WAS THE FIRST POLISH</li>
      <li>It gives a great, creepy crackled blood look!</li>
      <li>The red is particularly pretty especially over beige, gold, and bronze.  </li>
      <li>Brand new as expected without any flaws or being opened!</li>

<li> The red is particularly pretty especially over beige, gold, and bronze.  </li>
<li> Brand new as expected without any flaws or being opened!</li>
<li> Long lasting too....</li>
<li> I&#x27;VE USED IT OVER BLACK, OVER WHITE AND OVER MY REGULAR NAILS WITHOUT POLISH.</li>
<li> so I used a neon pink for underneath.</li>
<li> When I went to re-use it about a month later it was all dried up.  </li>
<li> First give the easy shatter effect like the black one does, really disappointed and ended up throwing them away!</li>
<li> you layer over other colors.  </li>
<li> and thought maybe I didn&#x27;t close the lid down tight enough the air dried it out.  </li>
<li> Not your everyday, plain red nail polish.</li>
<li> THIS IS MY LEAST FAVORITE SHATTER... &#x3D;(</li>
<li> Im not sure what other colors to put it over.</li>
<li> I shouold return it, but it&#x27;s too much trouble, so I just won&#x27;t order it again.  </li>
<li> Looks like dried blood spatter.</li>
<li> Normally opi is very expensive</li>
<li> THE PRODUCT WAS OLD AND LUMPY AND WOULD NOT GO ON NAILS AND LOOKED BAD</li>
<li> WHICH SUCKS CUZ</li>
<li> It is dull!</li>
<li> Sucks!  </li>
<li> Total disappointment!</li>
<li> Not great at all!</li>
<li> Bottle was broken when it arrived!</li>
<li> I ordered this for a scary Halloween look.</li>

    <li> Quick Delivery of polish i have only used this on a tester finger as a trial, the shatter effect is quite unique</li>
    <li> This product works really well. It shatters perfectly.  I took it to my nail place and they were jealous. They wanted to borrow it.</li>
    <li> Not great at all! First give the easy shatter effect like the black one does, really disappointed and ended up throwing them away!</li>
    <li> Beautiful red color! Not your everyday, plain red nail polish. It is red polish with a kick. Very nice over gold, bronze, and nude nail polish.</li>
    <li> THE RED SHATTER WAS THE FIRST POLISH I USED AFTER RECEIVING MY ORDER. IT HAS PERFORMED LIKE OPI SHATTER SHOULD AND HAS HELD UP WELL ON MY TOES, THANKYOU.</li>
    <li> Sucks!  Looks like dried blood spatter. The silver and turquoise shatter are my favs!  Still have yet to find a combo that will make this look decent.  I guess Halloween would work.  Oh well not all shatters are great. . .</li>
    <li> Awesome effects wihen you layer over other colors.  LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> It idnt look as nice over pink as the picture showed. Im not sure what other colors to put it over. Would appreciate any suggestions from anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Now to be fair the color of pink they showed wasnt in stock so I used a neon pink for underneath. Didnt look good. the polish its self is a nice red though.</li>
    <li> This shatter color looks great over just about any other solid nail color.  I got zoo many compliments when I wore this red over a metallic orange...looked so awesome!!  Long lasting too....my manicure can put in a full work week with no noticeable chipping.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like Shatter.  The red is particularly pretty especially over beige, gold, and bronze.  Like all Shatter polishes, the color really changes depending on what you put underneath it--not all colors work well with all Shatter polishes, so it is important to experiment with one finger before you commit to both hands.

    <li> I ordered this for a scary Halloween look. I am so pleased! It gives a great, creepy crackled blood look! Very happy!</li>
    <li> I LOVE  RED SO I COULDNT WAIT TO USE IT. BUT I HAVE ONLY USED IT ONCE AND IM NOT A BIG FAN... WHICH SUCKS CUZ RED IS MY FAVORITE COLOR. THIS IS MY LEAST FAVORITE SHATTER... &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish! Brand new as expected without any flaws or being opened! Very worth the money for it!</li>
    <li> Sent it to a girlfriend, she painted her toes and fingers and sent me pics. I like the color and she liked it.</li>
    <li> Total disappointment! Bottle was broken when it arrived!</li>
    <li> THIS IS.A VERY PRETTY POLISH OVER MOST SOILD COLORS. I&#x27;VE USED IT OVER BLACK, OVER WHITE AND OVER MY REGULAR NAILS WITHOUT POLISH. I RECEIVED A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS. A TIP FOR ALL IS THAT THE PATTERN WILL CHANGE DEPENDING ON THE WAY IT&#x27;S BRUSHED ON.</li>
    <li> Meh, not the look for me, but the polish is fine, esp as an add on for a buck or two. I gave it away-</li>
    <li> I normally love OPI Products but this selection was not for me.&lt;br /&gt;So don&#x27;t let my speculations, deter you from buying...&lt;br /&gt;Ref. OPI Red Shatter Crackle Nail Polish E55 New&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice day</li>
    <li> This product was amazing. I got it for my bestfriends birthday. She loved it and said it was great. And I love what price I had to pay for it. Normally opi is very expensive</li>
    <li> haha  WOW!! I never expected for my best friend to freak out when i gave this nail polish as a present. she loved it so much! the color was super pretty, and it looks great on nails!</li>
    <li> It is dull! Has no gloss or shine to it at all. It was delivered in a very timely manner but as for the color, I&#x27;ll pass.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it!  Crackle is beautiful and easy to do.  Great color and fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the first one in a set and used it once.  It was great.  When I went to re-use it about a month later it was all dried up.  I never had this happen before and thought maybe I didn&#x27;t close the lid down tight enough the air dried it out.  Now I received the second one I ordered and the moment I opened it, the brush fell out of the handle and I noticed cracks in the polish inside the jar.  I shouold return it, but it&#x27;s too much trouble, so I just won&#x27;t order it again.  A pity, since I really liked it the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product. I thought I was ordering regular nail polish and discovered that it was something different. When I used the polish as directec it still didn&#x27;t give me that crackle look. I would not order this product again.</li>
    <li> I love the crackle. So much fun to do nail art. I want to get more colors.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT WAS OLD AND LUMPY AND WOULD NOT GO ON NAILS AND LOOKED BAD SO I TOOK IT OFF. WILL PROBABLY TOSS IT.</li>
