      <li>AMAZING!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s not to say this isn&#x27;t good, and I do recommend it</li>
      <li>does a good job at both cover-up and tightening slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>/&gt;I am so in love with this stuff!  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>yes, I&#x27;m definitely in love!</li>
      <li>I actually liked it except that even when rubbed in thoroughly I could still feel it under my eyes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still testing the neck/decollatage cream, but I was also thrilled with the microdermabrasion cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still testing the neck/decollatage cream, but I was also thrilled with the microdermabrasion cream.</li>
      <li>it absorbs quite nicely</li>
      <li>I have been searching for an effective treatment for this for a couple of years and this is probably the most effective product I have tried to date.  </li>
      <li>I  liked this product but found something I liked better.</li>
      <li>Maybe people with more crows feet and wrinkles would see something that we haven&#x27;t, but so far, we are not that impressed.</li>
      <li>love the price on amazon</li>
      <li>eyes water a lot, and for this reason most eye creams are out of the question because they run into my eyes and sting.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting to that age where I want to know what I put on my eyes is doing more than just moisturizing</li>
      <li>/&gt;Several months ago I braved a MAC eye cream that was JUST a moisturizer; it was ok, but I want more than just moisture.</li>
      <li>(I still love and recommend the Anew products over Estee, Lancome, etc.!)&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I think it does work her eyes look better than ever</li>
      <li>Hydroxatone Hydrolyze Intensive Under Eye Treatment is such a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>so glad I got it</li>
      <li>I had a change in surface appearance and texture using Perfective Ceuticals eye cream, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll use from now on unless I find something better</li>
      <li>I feel so confident now.</li>
      <li>As the skin gets thinner towards my cheek, the purple gets more noticeable.  </li>
      <li>The puffiness is at the top, nearest my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I had a change in surface appearance and texture using Perfective Ceuticals eye cream, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll use from now on unless I find something better</li>
      <li>I wish this was in a tube which would protect the product better.</li>
      <li>It made my under-eye look more puffy.</li>
      <li>This size container yields many applications.</li>
      <li>Anticipate better results with continual use.</li>
      <li>is 45 and like many women has tried many dozens of beauty cremes, lotions, potions serums and the like.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Hydroxatone is one of the better working eye creams.  </li>
      <li>but it seems to stay on for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much more even, now.  </li>
      <li>love this stuff.</li>
      <li>The application was easy, went on smoothly with my fingertips, felt pleasant and creamy, and was easily absorbed by the skin under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Most importantly, it seems to be working.</li>
      <li>It would be fantastic if it lasted more.</li>
      <li>Good product and fast shipment</li>
      <li>good product works really well</li>
      <li>I had been using Victoria Principal&#x27;s Reclaim line for about 10 years and LOVED it, but needed something to step it up.&lt;br /&gt;After much reviewing, I found this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice, light cream that absorbs quickly, leaves the skin feeling hydrated and</li>
      <li>There is a very mild smell to it</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is great for hydrating and absorbs really nicely into the skin, but it did not work like I expected it to at all...</li>
      <li>this does nothing special and does not work better than the one I am already using .</li>
      <li>I have used eye cream since my early 20&#x27;s on the advice of mature women who swear moisturizer around your eyes will keep the skin around the eyes looking its best for many years.  </li>
      <li>I used during the day also and it was fine under makeup.</li>
      <li>Also there is no noticeable difference with the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
      <li>(I did see the fine wrinkles get smoother), so I recommend it for that aspect.</li>
      <li>Came quickly!</li>
      <li>ranges between the above two, but seems more pleasant when applied.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However if you do have a question, feel free to leave a comment</li>
      <li>This cream isn&#x27;t cheap either</li>
      <li>I find this cream feels very silky and nice on my skin.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not gone, but they&#x27;ve faded and that&#x27;s a good thing as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
      <li>The texture is smooth and quickly and easily absorbs into my skin.  </li>
      <li>The cream seems highly concentrated and feels amazing on my skin.</li>
      <li>When you first put it on, you feel a gentle bit of warmth, a very pleasant feeling, actually.</li>
      <li>Not as great as expected...</li>
      <li>(try it, won&#x27;t sting if it gets in your eyes and it leaves your skin nice and soft).</li>
      <li>I wanted to have a good comparison on how this worked, so I only used it on one eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for more than two weeks now, and don&#x27;t see much difference.  </li>
      <li>I am biased because I use another eye product that I really love, and just have not found something else that I like as much.  </li>
      <li>Good thing I set my sights low!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have the under eyes of a 20-year old (or even 30 or 40), but the eye I used this on has fewer and shallower wrinkles and that is a nice improvement.  </li>
      <li>Once I began using this, however, I was pleased from the very beginning.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;There is some ingredient that plumps up the under eye area fairly quickly</li>
      <li>I absorbs quickly and immediately hydrates.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply and very soothing.  </li>
      <li>If I would be able, I would send it back and recieve a full refund!......</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s pretty economical!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just not sure I&#x27;m ready for the kind of committment required to get my eyes looking good.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> like all miracle creams - it is all about the psychological comfort - no physical help</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, period. Made no difference at all. And when I called customer service they refused to give me the return info until they went through a LONG list of talk points on why I should keep it, and additional offers. It was haggle city. A real pain in the neck. Save your money and your time.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.  And it&#x27;s expensive&lt;br /&gt;I used it for 4 weeks no difference.</li>
    <li> I  liked this product but found something I liked better.</li>
    <li> Marvelous!!! love this product!!! always seen and heard about this product on tv so glad I got it, it took my under eye puffiness down right away!! Soon as I started using it never could find any product to help solve my under eye puffiness now I have, for sure try it!!</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working. I see a small change.</li>
    <li> Forget all the hype...this does nothing special and does not work better than the one I am already using . If I would be able, I would send it back and recieve a full refund!......</li>
    <li> Great product for my eyes.  Cant live without it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.  I only see slight changes.</li>
    <li> It did not work.  I still have bags and dark circles under  my eyesl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavinia Perry</li>
    <li> This was actually for my sister.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!!!  Does wonders for under eye circles and bags!!!  I have used this I the past,  was always looking tired and just awful but this really helps the circles and bags under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I thought the eye cream felt like it was dried out in the jar.  It was really hard to apply.  I might have just gotten a bad batch, but I won&#x27;t be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Not as great as expected...</li>
    <li> I have had dark circles since I was a little girl.  This product has worked for me in diminishing the dark, raccoon looking eyes I have had all my life.  I was doubtful, but willing to try it.  It does really work - - at least for me!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is the best I have ever have. I have always had dark rings around my eyes. This cream does what it says. You must use it the correct way or perhaps you will not get my results 2 X&#x27;s aday !!  Give it a try or try it again. My husband noticed it, I just said,&amp;#34; how are you liking my complexion now a days&amp;#34;? I had no make-up on at all. He pick it out right away. I was so happy he noticed.. I feel so confident now. Give it a try....you will be surprised, I certainly was.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This stuff doesn&#x27;t work. This might be an expense jar of lotion at best. All lies, same your money</li>
    <li> It stings my eyes..  I have not used it in awhile.  My eyes sting so bad  that  I have generous amounts of tears, and my makeup seems to get washed away.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks, and it seems to diminish the awful bags I have under my eyes.  They&#x27;re still there, but somehow appear smaller.  No allergic reactions, and you get a lot of product.  Will last a long time.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work miracles.</li>
    <li> It actually works! I apply twice a day as directed and I have noticed a great change. It does make my tear ducts leak but only for a minute. Will definitely buy another order!</li>
    <li> love this stuff. love the price on amazon</li>
    <li> I brought this 6 months ago and used the whole jar. this product does not work at all. don&#x27;t waste your money.i went on line to check&lt;br /&gt;up on their ad everyone of those people that talks about how great this product is gets payed to doing this. why can&#x27;t they tell the truth&lt;br /&gt;or don&#x27;t say any thing.i guess money really talks</li>
    <li> Not as advertised do not see that much if improvement</li>
    <li> I have only had this for about two weeks and i can already see a little change. I have puffy eyes and with school and working its hard getting the rest i need so i tend to have dark circles. I noticed my eyes are not as puffy as they used to be and the dark circles are still present right now. i will update as i use the product for a longer period of time. I like the fact that a little goes a long way. This little jar should last me till at least May. The directions specify its for the eye area only and you put this product around the whole eye area. There&#x27;s no weird or bad smell to it so that definitely helps. I did get a little in my eye the first time using it and there was no burning or anything like that, so over all this product seems to be a winner in my book. Will post an update soon.</li>
    <li> It made my under-eye look more puffy. I tested it three times on three different occassions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a sour dough texture and SMELL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as under eye treatment:&lt;br /&gt;Dove does a good job at both cover-up and tightening slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deadsea products truly tighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay ranges between the above two, but seems more pleasant when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So take your pick of these tried-and-true ones.</li>
    <li> Take my review with a grain of salt, I&#x27;m a guy (so&#x27;s my hubbie) and I didn&#x27;t follow the package directions exactly: ie. I didn&#x27;t wear it at night; only during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hubbie likes to try everything under the sun to care for his skin, but he&#x27;s got sensitive skin. This did not bother his sensitive skin, but he did stop using it rather quickly. He did not like it as much as the Regenerist product of the same ilk. When we got this he was using some even more pricey gel under his eyes and he went back to using that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use fancy creams usually (Vaseline with cocoa butter mostly) but I thought I would give this a shot. I actually liked it except that even when rubbed in thoroughly I could still feel it under my eyes. It felt like Eye Black. I can say that the skin under my eyes is softer and the wrinkles are a bit less noticable, but that could be because I have been washing my face and eye area especially with baby shampoo (try it, won&#x27;t sting if it gets in your eyes and it leaves your skin nice and soft). That and the price are the drawbacks...but like Regenerist, the price of this will probably go down when it isn&#x27;t the new kid on the block any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it (have been now for over a week, only during the day as I said--I don&#x27;t want to leave a greasy stain on my pillows--) and report back if I give up (as I have with everything except the baby shampoo).</li>
    <li> I have used eye cream since my early 20&#x27;s on the advice of mature women who swear moisturizer around your eyes will keep the skin around the eyes looking its best for many years.  I am now 36, and am still using basic eye cream.  But since I am getting a bit older, I thought I&#x27;d try something different, especially because I have always had what can be best described as light purple partial circles that spreads from the inner corner of my eyes to about halfway across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the texture of this cream, which reminds me of soft whipped butter.  It applies smoothly, not greasy or thick, and absorbs nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have sensitive skin, but this products does have a light warming, almost burning, feeling every single time I use it, for about 30-60 seconds.  Sort of like Vicks VapoRub.  I don&#x27;t care for this at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for 8 weeks, and have not seen any change in the circles under my eyes.  I also have a couple of small age spots in my eye area, and these have not diminished at all (I thought they might, since this is an anti-aging product.)  I didn&#x27;t really expect to see much difference in the fine lines around my eyes, since the claim of this product is to reduce the \\&quot;appearance\\&quot; of lines, which is not the same as actually reducing the lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot justify the lack of results with the current price of $79, even if I were just using this for a basic eye moisture cream, especially since I don&#x27;t like the burning sensation.  I&#x27;m going back to a basic eye cream.</li>
    <li> Just what my wife wanted she likes this stuff and I think it does work her eyes look better than ever</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it did not do anything</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a month now and do not see any difference.</li>
    <li> HYDRO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydroxatone is one of the better working eye creams.  It did reduce some of the appearance of under eye bags.  I would certainly buy it again</li>
    <li> This eye cream is very spreadable and seems to be helping with the dark circles and lines around the eyes.</li>
    <li> neither here nor there</li>
    <li> good product works really well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3-1/2 weeks so far and it seems as if some of the darkness around my eyes is improving.  It seems to make the skin around my eyes dry so I also have to use a moisturizer.  I also noticed that the area around my eyes has been breaking out more, not sure if this is a coincidence.  Since it is still early on I am interested to see how things will look over the next few weeks.</li>
    <li> I have used Hydroxatone am/pm cream for months and it is a great moisturizer. I just received the eye cream yesterday and put it under my eyes at bedtime. When I got up in the morning my eyes are stinging and burning. I am usually not sensitive but this bothered me to the point I had to wash my face quickly and use ice cubes to cool it down. I thought maybe I rubbed it in my eye so I tried again this morning just under the eye and it feels a little weird but I will wait and see what happens.</li>
    <li> Still really can&#x27;t tell that it has helped and I use it 2 x daily.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks, so it might be too early to tell for sure, but it does seem as if some of the darkness under my eyes has decreased.  My biggest concern was that I have ultra-sensitive skin so I need to be extra careful what I use on my face.  However, Hydroxatone Hydrolyze Intensive Under Eye Treatment has not irritated the skin around my eyes at all.  It is lightweight and non-greasy and does not have any overpowering fragrance that can be a deterrent for many similar products.  Most importantly, it seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I am a 50 year old man and I often \\&quot;consult\\&quot;(she gets to choose)with my wife before ordering Vine products.&lt;br /&gt;She is 45 and like many women has tried many dozens of beauty cremes, lotions, potions serums and the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both started using the Hydrolyze Eye Treatment about six weeks before our anniversary. She liked&lt;br /&gt;it immediately and I felt it was working after the first week or so. The \\&quot;proof\\&quot; though was in both of us receiving&lt;br /&gt;several compliments on our radiant glow and youthful looking faces. Coincidence? Maybe, but we both notice a&lt;br /&gt;difference in our faces in the mirror. And my wife claims it is the best eye treatment she has used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I recommend it without hesitation. Good product.</li>
    <li> Being a later 30-something, I&#x27;ve found myself suddenly experiencing vanity.  I noticed the wrinkles, the sags, and the dark circles under my eyes.  And I hate them all.  But what&#x27;s a girl to do, huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can&#x27;t turn back the hands of time to our youth but we can give the old hands a nudge with the help of products like [[ASIN:B009XRFA88 Hydroxatone Hydrolyze Intensive Under Eye Treatment]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so in love with this stuff!  It only takes a little bit (and by that I mean a dime-size on the fingertip) smoothed around the \\&quot;bag area\\&quot; of eyes and over the eyelids to see great results in about a week&#x27;s time.  There is a bit of noticeable difference with first application about make-up is applied but the real results come later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for just over a month and my eyes look less stressed and tired (you know the look I&#x27;m talking about, right?), the crow&#x27;s feet are very minimal, and my lids have a blump, youthful appearance.  I just feel so much better about my facial appearance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, last but not least, even using it twice a day, every day, my jar is no where near empty.  So plenty of bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, I&#x27;m definitely in love!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 31 and have always had dark circles around my eyes, especially since having my son two years ago.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2-3 months and have noticed an improvement in the skin tone around my eyes.  It&#x27;s much more even, now.  I use this twice a day, nearly every day.  I&#x27;ve not had any irritation but I do not normally have sensitive skin.  It has not caused any breakouts, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a fairly large container for an eye treatment.  After almost 3 months, I might be about halfway into it and I&#x27;ve been applying it generously.  After dipping further into the product, the oil starts to collect on the surface.  It&#x27;s not overly oily upon application.  When I apply makeup over it, it tends to become a little flaky at first but it seems to stay on for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with it, so far.</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this product.  I was intending to use it for darkness under my eyes but have had to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first I used the product twice a day as intended and I saw zero change in the skin tone, color, or condition under, above or around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, whenever I applied the product there was somewhat of a burning sensation.  Now I was careful not to get any of the product in my eyes, to not use too much product, and to apply it carefully.  Didn&#x27;t matter what I did, I always got a stinging burning sensation on the skin around my eyes where I applied the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, I started to lose eye lashes at a rate greater than usual.  Normally I lose an eyelash her and there and never think of it.  But after using this product I noticed a definite increase in the loss of eye lashes.  And with that I stopped using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe my skin is too sensitive, maybe it has a weird pH that is incompatible, but either way this product had negative effect for me and I cannot recommend it.  However if you do have a question, feel free to leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Made my eyes feel very moisturized. I used during the day also and it was fine under makeup.</li>
    <li> Lasts and goes on smoothly but haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet and have been using it daily twice a day for awhile now. Still hoping</li>
    <li> I love Hydroxatone products, but especially this one! The cream seems highly concentrated and feels amazing on my skin. A little bit goes a long way, and though the jar is small, I am sure it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed results after just a few days, and the area under my eyes looked fresher and brighter. The skin membranes under the eye are very thin, so applying a concentrated formula like this eye treatment does wonders after absorption. I would say be very careful, though, when applying the product, as it can irritate your eyes if you use too much. Again, less is more with eye creams!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a fantastic product, one which I will most definitely continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> I have pale skin and a genetic tendency towards dark circles under my eyes.  I have been searching for an effective treatment for this for a couple of years and this is probably the most effective product I have tried to date.  After about 5 weeks of use I have definitely seen an improvement, the circles are about half as dark as before-hooray!  I can not comment on how well this works for crows feet or wrinkles but for circles this is a winner for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is pretty thick and does not seem to have a scent.  I have not had any irritation.  The only drawback is that this is in an open jar. While pretty, exposure to air and dipping in fingers will shorten the life of the product.  I wish this was in a tube which would protect the product better.</li>
    <li> The description says that you&#x27;ll see results within two weeks.  I&#x27;ve been using this for more than two weeks now, and don&#x27;t see much difference.  My eyes have been puffier than ever lately - which may or may not be due to the use of this cream, but I definitely don&#x27;t see any reduction in wrinkles, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Nothing works on my dark circles - Nothing.  I recently tried ththis product.  I was prepared to be totally let down by this product. Surprisingly, it has done a reasonably great job!! My puffiness has gone down, which in turn, has reduced my darker circles. I am 58, have very translucent skin which is on the very dry side. I find this cream feels very silky and nice on my skin.  I do still have some blueish tint to my under-eye but I believe that that is genetic.&lt;br /&gt;We all know that creams work differently on different skin types and age&amp; extent of problem.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is the best product I have ever used around my eyes.  I absorbs quickly and immediately hydrates.  I use it at night, under my makeup, and during the winter months, I take it to work and dab a bit under my eyes.  It penetrates my makeup and is not greasy, so my mascara doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
    <li> This product is good, and it feels good when you apply--coolness. I am biased because I use another eye product that I really love, and just have not found something else that I like as much.  That&#x27;s not to say this isn&#x27;t good, and I do recommend it, I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years and do not intend to switch to anything else. I call it miracle in a jar or fountain of youth in a jar. Ladies, if you want to reverse aging time or at least stop it, here is your answer.</li>
    <li> I had been using Victoria Principal&#x27;s Reclaim line for about 10 years and LOVED it, but needed something to step it up.&lt;br /&gt;After much reviewing, I found this. It contains all three ingredients that are essential for preventing/minimizing wrinkles and lives up to its hype. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard so much radio advertisement about this product, that I was super excited when I found out about it...but when I started using it--I saw no visible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great for hydrating and absorbs really nicely into the skin, but it did not work like I expected it to at all...so sadly I am disappointed :(</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now. Both morning and night. No difference yet. Still hopeful:(</li>
    <li> Hydroxatone Hydrolyze Intensive Under Eye Treatment is such a wonderful product. It lightened the dark circles under my eyes, smoothed down crow&#x27;s feet, and fine lines under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice, light cream that absorbs quickly, leaves the skin feeling hydrated and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin around my eyes looks brighter, less dull, and not so tired looking. I credit this cream for my getting compliments on how well I&#x27;m looking lately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
    <li> This eye cream looked a little heavy, so I just barely touched my finger to the cream and lightly applied it under my eyes and on my crow&#x27;s feet. The cream feels soft and with a cool sensation. It took about a week before I started to see results, they are gradual but my crow&#x27;s feet have faded. They&#x27;re not gone, but they&#x27;ve faded and that&#x27;s a good thing as far as I&#x27;m concerned. This stuff works and that gets it a big five stars from me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other eye creams that all claim to reduce bags/puffiness, and dark circles. None have done anything whatsoever. I even spent a boatload of money to try Chamonix&#x27;s Genucel -- their marketing says you will see a difference &amp;#34;within 12 hours.&amp;#34; All lies. Genucel is vastly overpriced and it doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL. I didn&#x27;t have much hopes for this Hydrolyze, and it didn&#x27;t live up to its promise, either, but seemed maybe a tiny bit better than most of these worthless products that claim to be able to reduce under-eye puffiness but don&#x27;t really do anything. When you first put it on, you feel a gentle bit of warmth, a very pleasant feeling, actually. That made me think it might be doing something, then again, maybe they put whatever ingredients they did to give it a warming feeling just to MAKE you feel like it was doing something. At first I thought it was doing something and wrote a positive review, but now after finishing the bottle, I see that this product is nearly as worthless as all the others. I was also disappointed that as I got near the bottom the jar, the product got thick and cakey. The product also often flakes off, making it look like you&#x27;re peeling after a bad sunburn. Not worth the money; will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> There is a different product from the the same brand name.  It was not the utra like the one I ordered.  I do not think the ultra works as well for eyes as the other one..  The other one works much better. I would not order this one again</li>
    <li> Good product and fast shipment</li>
    <li> I used this cream for 3 weeks straight and thought I started to see a change, but then I went on a trip and feel like I got reset to day one. I&#x27;m not sure I want to start using something that I&#x27;ll have to keep using daily forever to get results. Maybe I&#x27;m just okay with having dark circles and using cover stick? It does seem to do *something* and there was no irritation. I&#x27;m just not sure I&#x27;m ready for the kind of committment required to get my eyes looking good.</li>
    <li> Very very disappointed. This product came with a container only half full half of the product was not in the container.</li>
    <li> i havent noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> Came quickly! I love the product!!</li>
    <li> Fantastick product. Fantastick price!!!</li>
    <li> I love the softness and firm skin around my eyes. I love this product! I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Expectation is on the low side. Maybe I need to give it a little more time.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about using this product, because I have persistent dark circles under my eyes, and I keep looking for something that will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It... might help? I don&#x27;t know for sure, because I have to stop using it after a couple days, because my eyes get all bloodshot and irritated, which is not a good trade! I do have some dryness due to the aftereffects of LASIK surgery, so I&#x27;m probably more sensitive than most people. But I try not to get any cream where it could possibly get into my eyes, and I still keep having this reaction. Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend if you have sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> I never believe the cosmetics industry when they make claims that a creme can make you look younger, remove fine lines, take away bags, lighten dark circles, blah blah blah.  The inflated price tags on facial products is laughable, when in the end the ingredients are all very similar and rarely do more than moisturize your skin.  I tried this complimentary jar courtesy of the Vine program and was hopeful that at least it wouldn&#x27;t irritate my undereye skin, but I had no pipe dreams that my dark circle would become lighter.  Good thing I set my sights low!  This creme, when used EXACTLY AS DIRECTED FOR SEVERAL WEEKS, yet did nothing more than moisturize my winter-dry skin.  The application was easy, went on smoothly with my fingertips, felt pleasant and creamy, and was easily absorbed by the skin under my eyes.  Here&#x27;s the bad part.  I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive eyes, but within 30 minutes, my eyes were tearing up and burning due to the irritation from this creme&#x27;s proximity to my eyes.  Though I was careful not to get any creme inside my eyes during application, there was obviously enough irritation just from being on my dark circles to create a strong and burning sensation in my eyes.  The dark circles are still as prominent as they were on Day One.  I discontinued use after four weeks because I could not tolerate the burning eyes.  If this product had even slightly reduced the appearance of the dark circles. I would give it four stars.  This missed the mark completely and therefore, since I cannot offer zero stars, I&#x27;ll toss over a one star rating and call it a day.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and very soothing.  Circles under eyes, appear less dark.  Anticipate better results with continual use. This size container yields many applications.</li>
    <li> My opinion is this eye cream lightened my skin while doing nothing for the actual purple beneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have faithfully used this product morning and night as directed.  The area underneath my eyes is both puffy and purple.  The puffiness is at the top, nearest my eyes.  As the skin gets thinner towards my cheek, the purple gets more noticeable.  This product did whiten some of the puffy area, but the area where the skin is thinnest shows no improvement. Also there is no noticeable difference with the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this just over two weeks. At 60, I don&#x27;t expect to see wrinkles \\&quot;vanish overnight,\\&quot; but I can tell that this cream stimulates under-eye circulation.  Don&#x27;t worry, it doesn&#x27;t sting like lip venom. This is a very generous sized jar, considering how small a dab you need.  I always end up having a bit left over on my fingertip to dab on my forehead or laugh lines.  My eyes are quite sensitive, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any problems with this.  In short, I wish I&#x27;d had this product back when I was in my 30s.</li>
    <li> If you have read my other reviews you know that I love and prefer Avon Anew&#x27;s line of anti-aging products over most any brand and would recommend them to ANYONE. You can actually SEE results from their eye cream! However....last year I had a horrible allergic reaction to a MAC powdered foundation. At that point, my skin went ballistic and I had to stop wearing any face/eye products that were &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; because they just made my skin sting and itch. This included my BELOVED, beloved Avon Anew eye cream and face creams! I had to completely stop wearing any moisturizers on my face/neck, that weren&#x27;t just BASIC. (I still love and recommend the Anew products over Estee, Lancome, etc.!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several months ago I braved a MAC eye cream that was JUST a moisturizer; it was ok, but I want more than just moisture. I&#x27;m getting to that age where I want to know what I put on my eyes is doing more than just moisturizing, I want it to earn its keep! The MAC product didn&#x27;t sting me, but it didn&#x27;t DO ANYTHING. I was stuck using this (my eye area is dry) because anything else just stung me. When the Hydroxatone came up in VINE, I had to sit and think about it for awhile; I figured that it would probably sting and burn since my skin is so reactive now after that horrible allergic incident. But, I decided to try it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes water a lot, and for this reason most eye creams are out of the question because they run into my eyes and sting. It takes a mighty thick cream to stay put on my upper eye area: I&#x27;m happy to report NO running, no stinging from the Hydroxatone. And, when I put this cream on either at night or in the morning, I don&#x27;t feel a dry &#x27;pulling&#x27; feeling on my eyes later. This cream keeps on moisturizing. It also isn&#x27;t so greasy that it makes your eye makeup run or slide: big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is so thick and rich, you only need to barely tap your finger to the top of the cream and you have enough to apply. I&#x27;ve had this about a month now and you can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;ve used any out of the container. With all the nice properties it has, I can see myself repurchasing this when (if!!) it ever runs out. I mourn the loss of my ability to wear the Avon Anew--deeply--but the Hydroxatone seems to be stepping up to what I expect from an eye cream. I think that it&#x27;s even reducing a latent puffiness I had under my eyes, that I just noticed today seems to be gone. I know that often I&#x27;d look in the mirror and think it looked a little &#x27;full&#x27; under there but just marked it up to getting older. This morning as I applied eyeliner I couldn&#x27;t figure out why things seemed different under my eyes and then I realized that the fullness (I don&#x27;t want to say &#x27;bags&#x27; but...) was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by the Hydroxatone products so far, I didn&#x27;t expect them to do anything for me but so far that&#x27;s two out of three I&#x27;m very happy with. I&#x27;m still testing the neck/decollatage cream, but I was also thrilled with the microdermabrasion cream. Hydroxatone has really caught me off guard but I&#x27;m glad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: So far this jar still has eye cream in it, and it&#x27;s been five months. That&#x27;s pretty economical! A tiny bit goes a long way. I will say that if I only needed depuffing in my eye area, this is what I&#x27;d get. But I need more; I&#x27;m seeing a bit of roughness, crepey lines and such. The Hydroxatone did a splended job in taking out puffiness that I didn&#x27;t even know I had! But it&#x27;s not so hot for my anti-aging needs. If you need hydration and de-puffing, this is quite a bargain! I probably have at least another month&#x27;s left of use in the jar. I had a change in surface appearance and texture using Perfective Ceuticals eye cream, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll use from now on unless I find something better but it&#x27;s not looking like I will.you can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;ve used any out of the container.

    <li> This cream is a moisturizing cream only and should be advertised as such and not anything else.</li>
    <li> I have a slight addiction to trying out different skin care products, so was very anxious to give this eye treatment a try.  At 38, my skin is not nearly as tight and elastic as it once was and I have always had a bit of an issue with dark under eye circles.  Once I began using this, however, I was pleased from the very beginning.  The texture is smooth and quickly and easily absorbs into my skin.  The area under my eyes appears lighter, brighter and smoother after a couple weeks of use and I look forward to seeing the long term results of using this daily.  I do want to mention that I have very sensitive skin, especially around the eye area - I have to be very careful the types of eye make up that I use because it will irritate my eyes and cause me headaches.  The Hydroxatone Hydrolyze Intensive Under Eye Treatment did sting a bit when I first began using it, though nothing overly bothersome or uncomfortable.  That sensation, however, did fade after a few applications and I have not experienced any sort of skin dryness in the areas that I have used the product, but smooth softness.</li>
    <li> After giving this product the old college try, I can honestly say that I see absolutely no change in the appearance of fine lines, dark circles, puffiness, etc. Maybe the key is in the word, &amp;#34;appearance,&amp;#34; because Hydroxatone does not promise that those things will actually be reduced or disappear completely -  only that it might appear to be the case. Maybe they are counting on beauty being in the eye of the beholder rather than being a reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all fairness, the &amp;#34;appearance&amp;#34; claim is made by almost every cosmetic company there is, so I do not hold it against Hydroxatone for marketing their product that way. But after several weeks of daily use, nothing appears to be different to me at all. The product, however, is a very nice moisturizer, if that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I used Hydroxatone Hydrolyze Intensive Under Eye Treatment for about four weeks and then gave up.  I wasn&#x27;t seeing any results.  Plus, the cream is very thick and doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin.  If I unconsciously rubbed my eyes hours after applying, it would get in my eyes and on my contacts blurring my vision.  Blinking and artificial tears did not remove it.  Only washing out my eye with water and soaking my contacts in solution worked to remove it and that isn&#x27;t always possible if you aren&#x27;t at home.</li>
    <li> I finished one whole jar but noticed slight improvement but nothing huge.</li>
    <li> My dad think this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I really hate my under eye area -- the wrinkles, bags and dark circles betray my true age and make me look older than I feel.  I wanted to have a good comparison on how this worked, so I only used it on one eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some ingredient that plumps up the under eye area fairly quickly so there was a noticeable difference between my eyes within a few days.  If I don&#x27;t use it over the weekend, the difference isn&#x27;t as obvious but there is still a difference after two weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, it isn&#x27;t miraculous -- I don&#x27;t have the under eyes of a 20-year old (or even 30 or 40), but the eye I used this on has fewer and shallower wrinkles and that is a nice improvement.  I also use it on the eyelid on that side but don&#x27;t really see any difference there.  But the difference between the eye I use it on and the other eye is enough to convinced me to start using it on both eyes.  I don&#x27;t like seeing how bad the other eye looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am wildly sensitive to fragrances in skin care products so was pleased when I opened it and didn&#x27;t smell perfumes.  There is a very mild smell to it but I assume that is the smell of the ingredients because there is no fragrance/perfume on the ingredient list. I can use this without having any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear extended wear contacts and have had no problems with this getting in my eyes and no stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is the same size and shape and in complementary colors to the [[ASIN:B009XRFAJW Hydroxatone Intensive Overnight Repair Cream, 1 oz.]] but different enough that you won&#x27;t grab the wrong one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My budget does not really extend to more than drugstore line skin care, but if I can&#x27;t find something less expensive that works as well on my under eye area, I would buy this product when this jar is gone.  I like the improvement in my under eye area after just two weeks of use and won&#x27;t want to give that up.</li>
    <li> Wow, an under eye treatment that really works! I&#x27;ve used this for over a week, both day and night and I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in my under eye circles. WOW is all I can say. AMAZING! This treatment is very thick and creamy and a little bit goes a really long way so use sparingly and it will last a long time. This is a small jar and doesn&#x27;t look like much, but then again it doesn&#x27;t look like much has been used so it&#x27;s well worth the investment as I predict this may last me 2 maybe 3 months. It would be fantastic if it lasted more. And also I had slight wrinkles and they appear to be slightly fewer. My under eye area feels less dry than before as this product feels it stays on longer through both day and night until you remove it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind aging as long as it is gracefully. In fact, I rather enjoy it, and not only because it beats the alternative. I have tried several eye creams, and many of them sting. This does not. That is my sole criterion, and this product meets it. It brightens the area under my eyes without making my eyes water and my skin sting, so A+++ rating.&lt;br /&gt;My eyes look and feel better, so this is going to become a regular part of my routine.</li>
    <li> My mom, who just turned 65 barely has any wrinkles but she does have puffiness under her eyes as well as darkish circles. She doesn&#x27;t wear much makeup at all but is religious with her moisturizer. She has been using this cream for weeks now but truly, I have noticed no difference. I don&#x27;t see her everyday so it&#x27;s easier for me to say if I noticed anything rather than her. She says she hasn&#x27;t either. She does like that it absorbs quite nicely and I guess as a moisturizer it works well. But that&#x27;s about it. This cream isn&#x27;t cheap either so I&#x27;m not sure what the benefits of using this cream VS another one are. Maybe people with more crows feet and wrinkles would see something that we haven&#x27;t, but so far, we are not that impressed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since it first came out. This is the same product and the price is better than I have found before</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions of the package, and I originally bought it after a high recommendation in 1-2 magazines that I read. I did use for 6weeks, and while it moisturized my under-eye skin, I still saw dark circles that were not very improved. It does firm up my skin (I did see the fine wrinkles get smoother), so I recommend it for that aspect.</li>
    <li> still waiting to see results</li>
