    <li> Love this product.  Use it everyday.  Used to use Moroccan Oil but it was more costly and I really like the way this makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> The girl who cuts my hair used this on me one day, and it was love at first try! I couldn&#x27;t get over how soft &amp; smooth my hair was; I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it! And it smells great. You don&#x27;t need a lot, but I now consider it a necessity when I blow dry my hair. Apply it to damp hair &amp; dry as usual. Viola!

    <li> Never ever feels greasy or heavy! Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I have very dry, coarse, frizzy hair.  Although I do not think this product helps the frizz, it does make my hair feel softer and look healthier.  I actually use it and then a smoothing gel and it makes the smoothing gel work without leaving the hair stiff when I comb it out later.</li>
    <li> My stylist had a sample of this ThermaFuse HeatSmart Serum and I after I smelled it, I had to get some for myself. It makes my naturally curly hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist introduced me to this product and it&#x27;s the best serum I&#x27;ve used. I love Moraccan oil, but this one tops it. If you blow dry your hair and use a flat iron, this is the serum for you!</li>
    <li> Perfect detangled and smoother for people w keratin straightening treatments</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and it is long, so the hair in the back underneath is the frizziest, this product calms the frizz and yet the curl stays really nice, it also makes your hair smell heavely.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it leaves my hair soft and shiney and looking very healthy.  It is very light so it doesn&#x27;t weigh you hair down.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands but keep coming back to this one.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> Great stuff !  Softens hair but doesn&#x27;t make it oily.</li>
