      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this every day for a week and have found my hair more manageable and easier to comb without tangles.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love it ..</li>
      <li>However, I use over the counter conditioners and Pantene has always been my favorite choice.  </li>
      <li>Overall, excellent results both in the shower and for hours afterward.</li>
      <li>This is one of the better conditioners I&#x27;ve used in a while.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>After using Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V Repair and Protect conditioner for about a week I was left fairly impressed at its ability to restore hydration as well as add a bit of luster and shine to the conditioned finish.</li>
      <li>Overall, a good conditioner at a great budget price.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>it added more moisture and my hair looks shiny, more bounce and healthier</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it works well on my hair.</li>
      <li>My wife &amp; I are pleased with the results of the Pantene brand.</li>
      <li>I was really happy to try this one as it promises repair and it really delivers on that promise.  </li>
      <li>I love the way my hair felt after using it.  </li>
      <li>my hair is lovely.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>Most of the frizz is gone and my hair seems relaxed.</li>
      <li>I think they have a great scent and are not very expensive compared to salon brands.  </li>
      <li>Pantene works great and you don&#x27;t need a full hand worth of it to work.</li>
      <li>I have color treated and  permed fine hair, so I need a conditioner that is both light and effective.</li>
      <li>This conditioner has a nice, mild fragrance.</li>
      <li>, I was happy enough with this product although I don&#x27;t think it was any kind of overnight miracle cure.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Besides that, it&#x27;s a very good product overall.</li>
      <li>But, for a product available from drugstores, this is pretty good.</li>
      <li>and so it was a \\&quot;no-brainer\\&quot; when this came up as available on the vine program to get some more product which we already love!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was easy to distribute throughout my hair and easy to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It damages and breaks easily</li>
      <li>My wife&#x27;s hair sure looks pretty though.  :-)</li>
      <li>These may seem like extras, but details like this are important when it comes to a product I use every time I shower.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The conditioner has a silky smooth quality to it as it is massaged into the hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>sweet fruity fragrance is a bit too strong and unnatural.</li>
      <li>conditioner itself smells good, works well, giving noticeably smooth hair, and as far as conditioners go it&#x27;s quite good, but I would ignore the whole piece of how much it can fix your hair otherwise it may set your expectations incorrectly.</li>
      <li>I did not notice a significant difference after using this product.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair soft, smooth and shiny (and smells amazing).</li>
      <li>Having a light fragrance that seems to evaporate quickly, there is no residual scent on the hair, thank goodness.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice finish and is never heavy.</li>
      <li>The claims that this conditioner makes seems to be true - the power to repair 6 months of visible signs of styling damage in just one use when used with Repair &amp; Protect Shampoo.</li>
      <li>same product, good price</li>
      <li>The price was super.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I can&#x27;t verify that this product has actually repaired the damage to my hair, I can say that since using it, my hair feels better to the touch and looks a lot better, too.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The back of the conditioner does state that it is OK for use on colored hair, so I felt confident in using it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Repair &amp; Protect Conditioner for 3 weeks as a daily conditioner, and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>It is a lot thinker than normal conditioner but that may be why it does a better job.  </li>
      <li>Less frizz and fly aways, smoother hair, I&#x27;m in.</li>
      <li>Overall this is a pretty good conditioner</li>
      <li>I do let my hair air dry for about 15 minutes, so that might be a good help.</li>
      <li>I have fine wavy hair and my hair have got really frizzy after all the hair coloring</li>
      <li>The product rinses out nicely, and doesn&#x27;t leave my fairly fine hair feeling greasy or weighed down.  </li>
      <li>For the right price I would recommend this for everyone who uses conditioner.</li>
      <li>After drying, my long fine hair felt very soft and smooth and looked better.  </li>
      <li>It is a good conditioner, readily available and affordable, but I don&#x27;t consider it to be superior to other conditioners in the same price range, so it&#x27;s a matter of personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>keeps my hair soft &amp; easy to comb through after a shower.</li>
      <li>I have used various types of Pantene products for years and am always satisfied with their quality.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recently been using Tresemme with better results than Pantene.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says.  </li>
      <li>I love Pantene products, especially their conditioners.</li>
      <li>And finally, my hair is soft for both brushing out and for styling, looking smooth and healthy throughout the day, despite the processing I&#x27;ve put it</li>
      <li>For a drugstore conditioner this works pretty well at making my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this conditioner over any higher priced drugstore brand conditioners.</li>
      <li>I tried this and after only one time, my hair looks much much better.  </li>
      <li>brushed through easily.  </li>
      <li>The bottle cap is the flip-open style, and is easy to open.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair smooth and tangle free without weighing it down.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Although I would not consider the results to be &amp;#34;dramatic,&amp;#34; the Pantene Pro-V in the Repair variety is an inexpensive, concentrated conditioner that does not smell bad.  Having a light fragrance that seems to evaporate quickly, there is no residual scent on the hair, thank goodness.  The first time using the product, I did have to fight with the cap that did not want to open for me, but I won.  The cream is very white and the dispenser on the bottom design makes for a fast treatment in the shower.  I leave it in for a couple minutes, rinse it and my hair is lovely.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel healthier.  I don&#x27;t know if we need the repair part but it definitely feels conditioned when we are done.  My wife says it makes her hair easier to style and that it looks better after being blow dried.  It is a lot thinker than normal conditioner but that may be why it does a better job.  The scent is unappealing.  Is smells like hotel bar soap.  It has a slight scent that disappears before it even makes it to our hair.  Bottom line is that this is a great conditioner.  It makes our hair feel good and that is the purpose of conditioner.  For the right price I would recommend this for everyone who uses conditioner.</li>
    <li> We find Pantene as a reliable budget brand hair conditioner.  Though we did not exactly see it &#x27;erase&#x27; six months worth of damage on our hair, it is significantly softer after using it.  My wife has thick hair and she needs a good amount of the conditioner in order to see the difference.  It is easy to rinse out and the scent is very pleasant and not perfumey, which we like.  Overall, a good conditioner at a great budget price.</li>
    <li> Because I hit the pool for lap swim workouts on a frequent basis I&#x27;m always on the lookout for good hair restorative products in my shampoo/conditioner or else I suffer the effects of dried out strands and other chlorine/chemical damage. After using Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V Repair and Protect conditioner for about a week I was left fairly impressed at its ability to restore hydration as well as add a bit of luster and shine to the conditioned finish. In fact, results were about on par with other conditioner products that I typically use that cost upwards to 2 to 3 times more per bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner has a silky smooth quality to it as it is massaged into the hair and scalp. Rinses out ok but requires some extra wash time as the silky residue tends to cling to your strands longer than expected. The fragrance is sweet and pungent reminiscent of perfume and berries. Overall, excellent results both in the shower and for hours afterward.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.  It does exactly what it says.  It repaired my fly away split ends.  I would recommend this to anyone needing a good repair shampoo.  The price was super.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better conditioners I&#x27;ve used in a while. I have really fine hair that curls like crazy in any humidity. It damages and breaks easily and I&#x27;ve pretty much resigned myself to having really short hair. Once it goes past collar length and starts going over my ears, it&#x27;s an unruly mop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this every day for a week and have found my hair more manageable and easier to comb without tangles. It&#x27;s not greasy, stays pretty thick in my hair and works. It does take more effort to wash out than other conditioners.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical when conditioners and shampoos talk about repairing months of damage to your hair, and how they can basically undo everything and make it great.  Lots of assumptions wrapped up in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner itself smells good, works well, giving noticeably smooth hair, and as far as conditioners go it&#x27;s quite good, but I would ignore the whole piece of how much it can fix your hair otherwise it may set your expectations incorrectly.</li>
    <li> My wife reports back that the product works to her satisfaction, leaving her hair soft and shiny and without too much of a strong lingering scent. I can personally report that when I tested on men&#x27;s (short) hair, the product made my hair feel softer, but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in shine.  My wife&#x27;s hair sure looks pretty though.  :-)</li>
    <li> Initially I thought this product was overstating its virtues, but I now agree that it really works as there is a significant  improvement in my color treated hair even on humid days. It only takes a small amount of product for my shoulder length fine hair, so this bottle will probably last me several months which makes it extremely cost effective.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Using this at the moment. Will be ordering more soon. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is a great \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; conditioner.  Helps keep your hair from drying-out.  It&#x27;s quite affordable.  Pantene has always had a great line of products, and this one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have really dry hair, and you&#x27;re looking for an extra to try. . .  then you might want to take a look at the \\&quot;overnight serum\\&quot; (link below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00AZYF90C Pro-V Repair and Protect Overnight Miracle Repair Serum 4.9 fl oz]]</li>
    <li> The conditioner smells nice and is easy to spread over my hair. It washes off well, too, and does not leave unpleasant residue. The hair seems to get smoother and softer after use. It does not seem to weigh the hair down.</li>
    <li> The claims that this conditioner makes seems to be true - the power to repair 6 months of visible signs of styling damage in just one use when used with Repair &amp; Protect Shampoo. Results are dramatic. Vibrancy returns. Smoothness makes a big come back.  I did not have six months of damage, but I recently had a bad perm and my hair was very dry and frizzy.  None of the other conditioners seemed to be helping, even a deep conditioner.  I tried this and after only one time, my hair looks much much better.  Most of the frizz is gone and my hair seems relaxed. I did not use it with their shampoo.  I like the consistency of the product and i&#x27;ts not too thick, greasy or oily.</li>
    <li> When you have a daughter with terrific long hair you go though a lot of conditioner. We&#x27;ve found that some of the less expensive kind works okay but you need to use a lot of it. Pantene works great and you don&#x27;t need a full hand worth of it to work. We&#x27;ve been impressed with Pantene products for years and so it was a \\&quot;no-brainer\\&quot; when this came up as available on the vine program to get some more product which we already love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> same product, good price</li>
    <li> I have thick shoulder length hair that requires a daily conditioner - even if I use a 2-in-1. I did not notice a significant difference after using this product. It has light-scent; not overpowering - which our household prefers.</li>
    <li> keeps my hair soft &amp; easy to comb through after a shower. I needed something not too expensive &amp; a good quality.</li>
    <li> I use Pantene products almost exclusively.  I was really happy to try this one as it promises repair and it really delivers on that promise.  I have a medical condition that causes extreme breakage and fall out if I comb too hard.  After using for just one week I have noticed the breakage and fall out lessen greatly.  I also like the fragrance.  I recommend this conditioner over any higher priced drugstore brand conditioners.</li>
    <li> Pantene has always been a good reliable drug-store brand. I used to use Pantene for years until my hair seemed to not like it anymore. I&#x27;ve recently been using Tresemme with better results than Pantene. However, I have always loved the smell of Pantene and this conditioner smells great and it did a good job conditioning my hair. When I am out of Tresemme I might consider switiching back to Pantene again.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love it .. Pantene has never let me down</li>
    <li> This is problem the best Pantene product so far.  I have been a Pantene user for a very long time.  I have had several people notice the difference in just a month of using this product.  I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> This conditioner does a great job at reducing frizz and making hair shiny and easy to brush.  It is especially good after too much sun and chlorine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sweet fruity fragrance is a bit too strong and unnatural.</li>
    <li> this conditioner helped my dry damaged hair. it added more moisture and my hair looks shiny, more bounce and healthier</li>
    <li> I LOVE  Pantene products! I need shampoos and conditioners that moisturize my hair which can dry out easily.  This conditioner moisturizes my hair without weighing it down or leaving it greasy.  It also has the great Pantene scent.  This will definitely be added to my conditioner rotation!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner. Makes my hair soft and silky without feeling stripped and dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m wary of marketing hyperbole, and I&#x27;ve yet to use a hair conditioner that&#x27;s a &amp;#34;miracle.&amp;#34; But if you&#x27;re looking for a reliable, basic, inexpensive hair conditioner to use routinely, this is an excellent choice. I found that after only one use, my hair was noticeably smoother and softer and I&#x27;ve kept using it.</li>
    <li> My wife &amp; I are pleased with the results of the Pantene brand. The shampoo was excellent and it turns out the conditioner lives up to our expectations. For me I not only like the bottle shape, as it stand on it s broad-based flat head and stays put; but the silky application where a little dab goes a long way, and the soft manageable results. My wife prefers it over other brand names as well.</li>
    <li> Generally, for shampoo I have to use a salon product to keep my dyed blonde hair from going brassy or green.  However, I use over the counter conditioners and Pantene has always been my favorite choice.  I don&#x27;t really notice a difference between the various formulations of Pantene conditioner, meaning, whether it is marketed to smooth and shine, or repair damage, or is age defying, I pretty much find them all to work the same which is very well. I think they have a great scent and are not very expensive compared to salon brands.  They are more expensive than Suave or VO5 but I feel when it comes to your crowing glory, you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> This product claims to &amp;#34;repair...6 months of visible signs of styling damage in just one use&amp;#34; and while it is moisturizing it&#x27;s not a miracle worker. It is a basic conditioner and made my hair manageable and shiny but it didn&#x27;t entirely tame the frizz. The scent is pleasant and I like the bottom flip cap dispenser for ease of use. I would buy this again but my styling products are still what makes my hair look presentable each day.</li>
    <li> I have fairly short (ear lobe length) hair I had been coloring brown for a while, and recently decided to go platinum and had it bleached, so it&#x27;s been through a lot of processing.  Needless to say, I need to use conditioner after every shampoo to have my hair be soft enough to brush out after the shower instead of feeling like tangled hay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Repair &amp; Protect Conditioner for 3 weeks as a daily conditioner, and am very pleased with the results.  It is easy to apply, not too thin or too thick.  It rinses out easily, not leaving a thick or greasy feel behind, including on my neck &amp; upper back which often happens with thicker repair-type conditioners.  And finally, my hair is soft for both brushing out and for styling, looking smooth and healthy throughout the day, despite the processing I&#x27;ve put it through!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is light and pleasant.  The bottle cap is the flip-open style, and is easy to open.  The bottle has a slightly matte finish, so it doesn&#x27;t get all slippery in wet hands.  These may seem like extras, but details like this are important when it comes to a product I use every time I shower.</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner fairly well, although I would not say it is the best I have ever used. But, for a product available from drugstores, this is pretty good. I don&#x27;t think it meets all the claims made on the packaging (mine was slightly different than what is pictured, though the product was identical). Especially the part about reducing six months of damage in one wash (my packaging really said this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it did fix *some* damage. I used this over the length of my hair after shampooing with the shampoo from the same product line. I concentrated my effort particularly at the ends. I don&#x27;t have split ends, but my hair is a bit damaged from years of color treatment. This was easy to distribute throughout my hair and easy to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I do think it helped. My hair was shiny and fairly soft the next day. And I think I didn&#x27;t have quite as many flyaways as usual, either. It is entirely possible that, with continued use, I will see continued improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you can compare my experience with your own, I have fairly thick, waist-length, color-treated hair. It is, I think, standard Caucasian hair that has a bit of a natural wave to it. I shampoo every night and let it air dry. It tends to be dry and I usually follow my conditioner with some detangling spray and a bit of hair oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I was happy enough with this product although I don&#x27;t think it was any kind of overnight miracle cure.</li>
    <li> My hair is medium-long, color treated (red) for many years, and thick.  For a drugstore conditioner this works pretty well at making my hair soft and smooth.  I&#x27;m not so certain about the claims of &amp;#34; repair 6 months of visible signs of styling damage in just one use when used with Repair &amp; Protect Shampoo&amp;#34;, though I don&#x27;t have the shampoo, so maybe that&#x27;s the set back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back of the conditioner does state that it is OK for use on colored hair, so I felt confident in using it.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any stripping of my red hair color and it seems to be gentle on it, causing no issues thus far.  Less frizz and fly aways, smoother hair, I&#x27;m in.</li>
    <li> Felt like it stripped my hair ! I will never buy Pantene again, I  felt like I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has a nice, mild fragrance. I have curly, frizzy hair and this conditioner does a fairly good job of conditioning my hair. It does not weigh down my hair. It does not feel greasy. Overall this is a pretty good conditioner and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner. Leaves my hair smooth and tangle free without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Pantene changed their scent.  I went to Target and smelled them all.  No notification of the change.  I have 5 huge bottles now that I hate the smell of.  Pantene used to smell wonderful.  No longer.  Now it smells acidic and acrid.  At first I thought maybe I had my bottles too long and it deteriorated.  Not so.  THEY CHANGED THE SCENT AND IT&#x27;S AWFUL.</li>
    <li> I have color treated and  permed fine hair, so I need a conditioner that is both light and effective. So far this one leaves my hair soft and shiny. Kinda has a fruity scent to me not to heavy but smells a little fruity.  Pantene is a brand i have used for a long time now. I love how it does not weigh my hair down or make it look oily but also repairs the damage of blow drying, curling, perming all that.</li>
    <li> I have used various types of Pantene products for years and am always satisfied with their quality.  I have long wavy hair that I have to blow dry (otherwise, it takes hours to air dry.)  Because of using the hairdryer so often, the condition of my hair has suffered.  Even with trimming it, the ends still get dry and brittle and split easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can&#x27;t verify that this product has actually repaired the damage to my hair, I can say that since using it, my hair feels better to the touch and looks a lot better, too.  It doesn&#x27;t feel dry and it is easier to style without weird fly-away ends.</li>
    <li> While I didn&#x27;t find this product to have any remarkable repair capability, it does work well as a conditioner for most people.  The scent is pleasant but not overpowering.  The product rinses out nicely, and doesn&#x27;t leave my fairly fine hair feeling greasy or weighed down.  It is a good conditioner, readily available and affordable, but I don&#x27;t consider it to be superior to other conditioners in the same price range, so it&#x27;s a matter of personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like that this product contains keratin, most commonly a slaughterhouse byproduct.  I really don&#x27;t like the idea of cow hooves, etc., on my hair.  I&#x27;m going to look for a plant based product as an alternative.</li>
    <li> In combination with a shampoo that neutralizes chlorine, this prevents or repairs the split ends that appear after only a few sessions in the pool.  Before I found this, I&#x27;d have to gingerly work a brush through my hair to disentangle.  Split ends are now history.  I found this once at a brick and mortar store but after I discovered it worked, I never saw it in a store again.  Thank you Amazon for making this a Prime item!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it works well on my hair. I use it in combination with the Shampoo &amp; Serum and my hair is soft and manageable EVERY day!</li>
    <li> I cannot say i have seen a drastic different in the quality of my hair using this product. I  have been using this conditioner on my fine hair for a few weeks. As much as I do like Pantene I would probably would not use this part of their line again.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is just what my hair needs for the dry winter. I use it with the Repair and Protect shampoo. After blow drying and straightening my hair I don&#x27;t even need product. I&#x27;m serious. I do let my hair air dry for about 15 minutes, so that might be a good help. I used to have to spray down all my crazy fly aways, amd now I don&#x27;t have to. Only down side is I have to wash my hair more often- but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a bad thing.</li>
    <li> Pantene is my go to brand for off the shelf conditioner.  It has a nice finish and is never heavy.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 2 months ago. I have fine wavy hair and my hair have got really frizzy after all the hair coloring plus I use the blow dry and flat iron A lot. After using this I have notice my hair is getting better, less frizz and smoother. I will reccomend this product to everyone that wants ther hair feeling natural again. Just love it!!!</li>
    <li> This smells good and works wonders.</li>
    <li> The Pantene Pro-V Repair and Protect conditioner is the best. It is gentle yet after one wash you can already see the difference. It leaves your hair soft, smooth and shiny (and smells amazing). I would recommend this to anyone, but especially if you have long and thick hair. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. As a natural (4c hair), I know not to really use a ton of Pantene products unless it&#x27;s strictly for &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34; hair. But this works very well. Makes my hair feel Really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, do Not try to leave it in for a Very long time. 35 minutes tops. If not, it&#x27;ll turn your hair Very stiff.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, it&#x27;s a very good product overall. It smells wonderful as well.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this Pantene conditioner.  The bottle is large and you don&#x27;t need for very much for each use, so it will last a while.  The conditioner has a nice flowery scent.  After rinsing it out, I had no tangles and my hair brushed through easily.  After drying, my long fine hair felt very soft and smooth and looked better.  It was not weighted down and had seemed to have some extra bounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner did seem to help repair my hair&#x27;s dryness and damage.  I love the way my hair felt after using it.  I highly recommend this conditioner!</li>
    <li> I love Pantene products, especially their conditioners. Nothing works better on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair manageable and soft. I&#x27;ve tried other conditioners, but I always come back to Pantene.</li>
    <li> I have dull, colortreated hair and thia system has helped ro make my hair soft, shiny, and managable. Receiving compliments on the shiny hair.</li>
