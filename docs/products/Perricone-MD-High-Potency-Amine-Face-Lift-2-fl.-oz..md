<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I personally love all of Perricone MD products.  This product is highly effective providing the skin with an instant look and feel of having had a face lift.  Another must have beauty product.</li>
    <li> Although I didn&#x27;t get the lift I expected I did get nice definition after using this product consistently for a couple of weeks.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love all dr.perricone beauty products awesome results !!!.😊😊😊</li>
    <li> Have used this for many years and love what it does for my skin.  Helps wrinkles fade and stay away.  Will use this forever!!</li>
    <li> Like the product.  Smells better than Cold Plasma, but works about the same.  It is hard to tell much difference for a woman my age (62) and an avid outdoor person and 32-year flight attendant.</li>
    <li> Use a sunscreen,  Use sunscreen</li>
    <li> The only thing that could make this product any better would be if it could be less expensive !</li>
    <li> I am a big user of many facial products (check out my reviews). I wanted to like this (sort of -it ain&#x27;t cheap), but it just doesn&#x27;t do a think for me. It&#x27;s too light, and I see no benefit with long-term use. When this happens to products at half-use, they become my chest and hands only product. I will only use the superior stuff for face and neck on a daily basis. I won&#x27;t re-order.</li>
    <li> Only after a few applications, I could (and especially my boy friend) definitely notice a difference in my skin!  Very highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I use the No Foundation Foundation so when I used the last of the skin care line I was looking to replace, I went to the Perricone MD site and took the skin care quiz. This product was one of the products suggested for me. I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin so I decided to purchase the full size. I should have gotten the sample. I read through the ingredients and nothing stood out as being an allergen for me. Well this product makes me itch - my face &amp; my neck are driving me crazy and I&#x27;m scheduling with the dermatologist today. Also keep in mind that if you purchase through Amazon rather than the Perricone site, that you can&#x27;t return something once it&#x27;s opened. Had I purchased through Perricone, I would be getting a $69.00 refund. I was offered a 30% discount on my next product through the vendor, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I will be purchassing skin products only through the actual company site from now on.</li>
    <li> I heard great media hype about this product.  It is a good moisturizer, but definitely nothing special given the price.</li>
    <li> Actually able to feel a tightening of my skin.  At 79 years of age I&#x27;m amazed at how it makes my skin feel &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; which makes me feel better about myself.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference and I  am very disappointed. I should be able to trust the claims from a physician.</li>
    <li> I have only used for 4 mornings along with Perricone MD  High Potency Evening Repair for 3 nights and both have had a dramatic effect on my skin!  I had two pimples come up on my face which I rarely have break out which I&#x27;m sure the products just pulled out some impurities.  I have several deep wrinkles below my left eye I believe because I&#x27;m prone to sleep on my left side (I have mastered falling asleep on my back the last several years; but  during the night I end up laying on my left side).  These deep wrinkles have tremendously been reduced and the other smaller wrinkles are fading in just 4 days!  I have serious very deep  marionette lines and honestly can&#x27;t see much improvement there yet.  I am 58 years old and have spend my life in the hot Florida sun.  Only the last 12 years have a used a sun screen on my skin and only the last eight years started using 70+ on my face, neck and chest and I wear a hat.  I have medium to medium dark skin and have only had one sunburn as a child.  The really noticeable wrinkles only started to appear at 55 years of age when my skin became drier which I contribute to hormonal changes. My skin type has always been on the normal side not too oily, not too dry just right.  I hope these two products will also have some effect on my neck as I was born with a fat pocket under my chin which is now starting to sag...when I was in my twenties &amp; thirties I spoke to several doctors that said I would need to have it surgically removed. I am very pleased with my purchases and I would recommend them; a little on the pricey side but a little goes a long way; well worth the expense!</li>
    <li> it does what is says, tightens without drying or leaving a residue.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product under my regular moisturizer and it is wonderful..I think it even helps get rid of brown spots.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and feels wonderful…Highly recommend</li>
    <li> WARNING!!!  This is an UNETHICAL company that makes charges on your credit card without your permission.  I ordered directly from their web site, and they started billing me for large amounts of money for no reason.  They obviously had no permission from me to bill me very large amounts of money.  I tried calling them to complain, and as soon as the automated answering machine found out I wanted to contact their billing department, they automatically hang up the phone.  STAY AWAY from this company!!!  They will start putting HUGE bills on your credit card without your permission, and then it&#x27;s just a hassle explaining to the credit card company that they are billing you without your permission.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful and I highly recommend it for those who have lines and wrinkles, it improves the skin&#x27;s appearance and help minimize the look of the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> If this product was like when I purchase it through stores, I would have given it 4 stars. I am not sure if it was old, watered down or what but it was not effective.</li>
