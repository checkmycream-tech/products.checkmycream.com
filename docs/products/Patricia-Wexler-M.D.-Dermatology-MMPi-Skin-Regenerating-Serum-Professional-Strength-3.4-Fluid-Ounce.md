<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really disappointed, I would rather save money to buy super copper peptides to increase my collagen production as antiaging weapon rather than this nonsense, If you want remarkable skin improvement, you should resort to Acid peel or Derma roller/stamp with copper peptides to force your skin to produce collagen to regenerate. This is the last ordinary commercialize product I would buy, if you are afraid of pain/ acid then this is good choice, but no pain no gain.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite creams, I have been buying it in any sizes and always have it at home, trully make skin smoother.</li>
    <li> Been using this serum for years.  Thanks so much</li>
    <li> This is the best skin care product I have ever use, and the only one that helps relieve the scaling and itching of Seborrhea for me.  I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Patricia Wexler for 7 or 8 years now. Before using her products I struggled with finding the right products that worked for me. I have rosacea &amp; very sensitive skin. One day I wandered into Bath and Body Works &amp; discovered this magnificent collection.&lt;br /&gt; I use a few things from her. Including this serum. I&#x27;ve received many compliments as well.&lt;br /&gt;Like other women...I will be using her products the rest of my life. Thank you Patricia Wexler!</li>
    <li> I used to use this seven years ago and stopped because the price at bath and body was way too expensive in college.  I bought it on a whim of a memory.  &amp;#34;Didn&#x27;t I love this once upon a time?&amp;#34;  It arrived.  WHY DID I STOP USING THIS!!  A little goes a long way (otherwise, your make up will slough off if you over do it).  My skin is so smooth (not smooth like oil.  I mean smooth as in texture of my actual skin - so flat and perfect).  I am a user for life.  If it works this many wonders for me at 27, I am happy to look 10 years younger at 50, too!</li>
    <li> You get a lot for your money.  This is the softest serum I have ever used. It feels like your applying silk to your face.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely product for me; I&#x27;m 73 and have used it for many years... a.m. and p.m.  My skin appears smooth and hydrated.  No fuss... just good ingredients and regular use.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum, especially in the humid, warm weather months. It goes on the skin very matte and doesn&#x27;t make your face oily or greasy. I&#x27;m in love with the texture of it. I first discovered it in a free sample from Bath and Bodyworks. I&#x27;m still using that sample as it was a pretty good size and you don&#x27;t need much of this. This is a great price for a huge container of 3.4 ozs. As it spreads so well and you only need a small dab on the forehead, checks, nose and chin, it will last me for quite some time!</li>
    <li> Really helped my serious dry itchy skin. I love how smooth and rich it feels</li>
    <li> Gives you a glow that people notice.</li>
    <li> I did like this product, but didn&#x27;t love it. I really liked how my skin feels after I use it, but I didn&#x27;t see any changes in my skin texture or appearance.</li>
    <li> Love Wexler products but coud never afford them retail. My skin is smoother and softer when I use Wexler products.  That&#x27;s why I love Amazon. I can by quality products fr less.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I am 64 but my skin looks 40.  For bnest results, rub deep into skin at bedtime &amp; let it soak in.</li>
    <li> This serum makes your skin feel very soft, but I haven&#x27;t really seen any reduction in lines and wrinkles. I get the same result from much less expensive creams.</li>
    <li> I love this serum and use it twice each day!</li>
    <li> This is a very good skin product.  Have used the product in the past and have been very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for years and my husband loves it as well.  Greatly absorbs into skin with no greasy residue at all.  I have tried several products through the years and this is the best product for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum for about 2 years.  It only takes a little bit to cover the face and neck, so it lasts a long time.  I love how soft my skin feels after using it.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! My skin is very dry and  this is the best product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the most luxurious feeling serum or cream I&#x27;ve ever tried. It glides on smoothly and gave my skin a nice dewy look. One jar didnt last long because I kept applying and reapplying for the fun of it. However I dropped MMPI from my skincare routine a few yrs ago after becoming more health conscious. If Wexler made a &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; version I&#x27;d buy in a heartbeat. Humongous jar lid &#x3D; total waste of plastic</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Really works been using it for years</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever use and I&#x27;ve tried may . Its worth the money i really have sensitive skin and this product has been great for my skin. If I had the funds I would travel to NY to Dr. Wexler personally to care for my skin. The whole line is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two days on my face and neck. The first day, my skin was nice and soft, although the serum is heavy; not ideal for summer. On the second day,  everywhere the serum has touched is bright red. You can see the line on my neck where I stopped spreading the serum. I have washed the serum off, but skin feels like I&#x27;ve gotten a sunburn. I do not have particularly sensitive skin, and used the packaged product as directed.</li>
    <li> as an older woman, I look for products that will moisturize and improve the appearance of my skin.  The Dr. Wexler serum looked like it might do the trick, to judge from a number of reviews.  I should have read further.  The &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; is thick and heavy in the jar and on the face.  Even used sparingly, it lies uncomfortably on the skin.  I can&#x27;t understand, given its texture, how skin can absorb it.  I tried it for three days;  by the second day, my skin was breaking out in little, pink bumps.  By the third day, I wanted the product as far from me as possible.  Possibly a woman with a different kind of skin could use it.  I could not and returned the product.</li>
    <li> I opened the bottle and got a tiny bit on my fingers then got distracted,  not 5 minutes later I was swelling up all over the place.  I went into anaphylaxis shock and before the ambulance could get there I was blue and unresponsive,  I actually died. Thankfully I was revived and after a stay in the hospital for 3 days under observation I was released.  I will never use this again. .</li>
    <li> I have been using Patricia Wexler Products for about 10 years now. This is my favorite product. I use it after I bathe in the evening. It makes your skin feel so soft and I do think it helps the aging process. I have recommended this product to family and friends but not a lot of people can spend the money on the more expensive facial products.  Amazon has better pricing than Bath and Body works.</li>
    <li> I really love this product and use it with the Moisturizer every day.&lt;br /&gt;This gives my skin more moisture and leaves my skin feeling supple and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Bath&amp;Body years ago. When I ran out, I did not buy it again because of the high price tag. I thought I could achieve the same results with less expensive products.&lt;br /&gt;I always remembered that I was constantly receiving compliments about how smooth my skin looked.&lt;br /&gt;I am African-American and have very sensitive skin and had an allergic reaction rash on my face a couple years ago that left my skin uneven. My pores seemed to be too open and not smooth as it once was.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to bite the bullet and buy the serum again.&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of using it every night (using twice a day was too strong), I can see that my skin is regaining its glow and looking smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I did find that I have to make sure that I use sunscreen or else my skin gets a little red on  my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am so glad that I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a small amount on the tip of my index finger to cover my whole face. The 3.4 oz will probably last about a year or so. That means it really is only costing pennies a day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 years. Makes the skin feel like silk. Evens out skin tone. Doesn&#x27;t leave heavy moisture film, just nice balanced skin. I&#x27;ll never switch!</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does. Likeher serum.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for several years and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I have used this serum for many years and it is great.  Not greasy of heavy.  It is especially good in the winter time.</li>
    <li> Goes on like velvet. Feels great.  I am not so sure it proves look or quality of skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 years now. Just love it! Finally found it at Amazon!</li>
    <li> I like Patricia Wexler products, it is very good for my skin. I ma 65 years old and hardly have any wrinkles. I am using her products for several years and never regret, and will use it as long as it available!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and enjoy it. I only buy it on sale and find that I can make a container last for a couple of months, minimum. It&#x27;s a serum to be spread very thinly over the face, not a cream to slather on.  I wish the ingredients were listed,  because I tend to think it is not much different than putting a light coating of Vaseline or a similar substance on my face--at least, that&#x27;s the way it feels to me. A test on my hands showed me that the back of the hand with the serum looked less dry hours later, so I do believe it does a good job of retaining moisture and minimizing lines as a result.</li>
    <li> Best serum product I have used.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have used for many years.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer.love it.</li>
    <li> I usually buy Estée Lauder night cream.  I tried this once and now use it.</li>
    <li> I have a 6 month old and I swear my skin is softer than his when I use this product.  And my fine lines are greatly diminished.  I use Pond&#x27;s cold cream for a cleanser, then this, then Neutragena&#x27;s visibly even moisturizer to even out old acne marks.  In the first 2-3 weeks I felt like I had a new face.  Since then the difference is slower to notice but there continues to be gentle improvement each week.  Worth buying on the sale price, for sure.</li>
    <li> I hate the BIG jar it is in, but the product doesn&#x27;t seem to have a good texture like what I have previously purchased.&lt;br /&gt; I have to be really careful how I apply it, or if it comes in contact with my eye glasses, it leaves a heavy film, I  did not have this problem&lt;br /&gt;before.</li>
    <li> I love the regenerating serum. Nothing makes my skin softer.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I like the texture of the product and how it makes my skin feel, but I always wondered what&#x27;s in it. The ingredients are only listed on the box and not on the jar.  So for those of you wondering what&#x27;s in it.  Here it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dimethicone, cyclopentasiloxane, isododecane, polisilicone-11, dipropylene glycol, butylene glycol, myristyl nicotinate, cyclohexasiloxane, cetyl, peg/ppg-10/1 dimethicone, dimethiconol, pyrus malus (apple) fruit extract, cinnamomum cassia bark extract, rheum palmatum extract, glycine soja (soybean) seed extract, water, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, ethylhexyl salicylate, silica dimethyl silylate, bisabolol, laureth-12, propylene glycol, diazolidinyl urea, iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, RED #33 (CI 17200), YELLOW #5 (CI 19140)</li>
    <li> I read the ratings before I bought this item and I was not disappointed.  I love the way my skin feels, so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the price but it is a big jar and should last about six months.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase at excellent price. Product delivered results as promised.</li>
    <li> great stuff.,  been using this product for over 10 years and still love it.</li>
    <li> I love the Serum, I just couldn&#x27;t find it anymore until I looked on Amazon. I will continue to order this item, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I like it, I don&#x27;t love it. It feels good on and am seeing a slight difference. Not sure for the money if I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> It is great on elbows, but I can&#x27;t say I really love this product. Goes on and stays pretty greasy.</li>
    <li> I switched from Olay anti-aging to this and the difference was amazing. Overnight, my skin felt softer and more moisturized. My pores also look smaller. The product is red in color but does not show on the face. I love the feel of it - it&#x27;s very luxuriant. Each bottle lasts about 6 months even though I use it twice a day. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Love it, recommend it to all for a healthy silky feeling day and night.  Supplier was wonderful!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Fantastic price for same product they&#x27;re selling in store</li>
    <li> This is one of several products by Patricia Wexler M.D. that I use and love. It has improved the condition of my skin. Helps with my dry flakey skin. I also use her Intensive Night Reversal and Repair Cream. I really like how it helps with my dry skin. She also has a skin resurfacing cream for scrubbing off the dry skin flakes called Resurfacing Microbrasion System and her Anti-Aging cleanser. All good products. I found her products on QVC years ago and I found it here on Amazon and it is more affordable here on Amazon. There are several sellers selling it on Amazon. Just check with each one and get the best deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for years, and I love them.  I&#x27;m 67 years old and get many compliments about my skin and have no age related problems on my face.  They also protect me when I am out in the sun.</li>
    <li> I am now 63 years old and have been using Patricia Wexler&#x27;s Intensive 3-in-1 Day Cream for 4 years and have found it keeps my skin supple, moist, and the tiny wrinkles at the base of my cheeks have not deepened. Her Regenerating Serum also smooths out my skin and I am very happy that it especially eliminates the tiny bumps on my chin. Recently I tried the Olay regimen, but I found the skin at the side of my chin began to sag and my whole face looked pulled down and mean looking. So I went right back to Patricia Wexler&#x27;s products and my face is happy and looks it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the day and the night creams for about a year. Supple moisturized skin to the point of to shiny some days. When it gets warm i have to switch to another day cream as this is to rich and i look like an oil slick and get clogged pores. I will definitely keep it as my winter cream. Also you can now buy it in bath and body works and they have deals on it now and again.</li>
    <li> love it, a little sticky at first but I got used to it. A few days without it and I was right back using it again!</li>
    <li> A nurse in the cardiac care unit (don&#x27;t worry - all is fine) of our local hospital checked my arm band and did a double take after looking at my age. She then asked me what I used on my skin.  I told her I used Patricia Wexler &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; - this great pink stuff in a jar. I am not sure she knew what I was talking about but I have to say, her asking me that made my day, after a scary night in the ER. I have been using this product for a couple of years and there is not a better thing on the market for dry sky.  Yes, it is expensive but is fabulous. I agree with the less than four star review, it does not work that well on wrinkles, but it is the best product for the dry, arid CO weather.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for around 5-6 years. Always go back to it as a basic. It protects my extremely dry and sensitive skin from the elements with out any oily appearance. Yes, it does need a light moisturizer over it, patted lightly. For liquid make-up, I follow with Dr. Brandts Pore-refining primer and I have a much improved matte appearance to skin. Does not prevent wrinkles, but is very soothing. I need that as I have Hypo-thyroidism and am post-menopausal, a double whammy. And blonde and fair-skinned.It is rather thick and can be applied sparingly if you need. I need a little more! It may not be a big preventative, but I keeps my skin soothed and has calmed some rough &amp;#34;rashing-type&amp;#34; reactions for me.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time and was new in box just like posted</li>
    <li> Always a great choice. Good Price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> this serum makes your skin feel soft and it smooths out wrinkles</li>
    <li> great price!!! fast shipping ! love it !Love this stuff. Skin glows and changes the entire texture of skin! used it for years. will only buy this from amazon $63.00 vs $150.00/No brainer!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have used it for over 2 years and my face is soft and less lines.</li>
    <li> Great product.  This really keeps the skin well hydrated and very smooth.</li>
    <li> I keep coming back Wexler  Skin Regenerating Serum; especially in the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;It just makes me feel good.</li>
    <li> I do believe this helps with the wrinkles. I use it in the morn ing and before i go to bed.</li>
    <li> Fine product, have used it for years with no problems, just needed a refill of this fine product and price was better than other venues.</li>
    <li> I like it very much and I recommend it to my sister and she like it to. We will recommend to other people about this product.</li>
    <li> I used this product about 4 or 5 yrs ago and was very pleased, like many times, I tried other products, then I remembered how happy I was with this product.  I researched it again and found it on amazon and purchased it.  I love how it makes your skin feel, not sure if it can help with wrinkles, but I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I used to use this product and told myself I wasn&#x27;t worth the price.  Recently I found a jar with just a little left.  After using it I realized I needed to continue so I found it on Amazon.  I do love this product and the size I bought will last for many months.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  i have been using it off and on for years.  I do stop every once in a while to give my skin a break, just because I think you shouldnt constantly cover all your pores, your skin needs to breath.  It makes my skin so soft, and my make up lays atop with perfection.  I have also noticed that I do not have as much acne when I use it.  At almost 40 years old, I still have occasional breakouts.  I truly believe this serum helps keep my skin look healthier.  My husband will tell you that he agrees that my skin looks younger and more radiant when I am using the serum, even if its only day one or two.  I will continue to use this stuff, and hope it never goes away - I have found nothing like it, and I have tried because it can be costly - But it is well worth it.  Love Love Love!!</li>
    <li> Love this and glad I could get it on sale because I couldn&#x27;t afford to pay full price of $150.00!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting</li>
    <li> Like too see not sooo..thick.but wirks well with a face serum</li>
    <li> This serum is great!  I haven&#x27;t found any I like as well as this.</li>
    <li> Great product, I&amp;#34;ve been using it for years. Arrived quick thank you.</li>
    <li> I had a free sample and I loved this product, so I ordered the serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the regenerating serum for several months.  I bought it to minimize wrinkles and sagging around my neck and to smooth the crepe skin on my decollete.  I then started using it all over my face. Why not? Only a dot of serum will cover my entire face.  I&#x27;m a realist and know that the only way I can get rid of all this is plastic surgery, but Dr. Wexler&#x27;s skin regenerating serum is the next best thing.  My wrinkles are smoothed almost all of the way out; however, if I don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis, guess what?  They&#x27;re back!  My face looks radiant.  The only thing the serum does not do is take away the sagging under my chin, but I don&#x27;t think the serum is intended to do that.  So I&#x27;ll be hunting for something else.  In the meantime, it&#x27;s all the way with Dr. Wexler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some complaints on Makeup Alley, so let me say that this serum is not made for younger people.  It is for 50+ people with real wrinkles.  Under 50, you should be using preventative products. (50 is an arbitrary number -- you alone should know when you need something for your wrinkles.) Second, there were some complaints about the &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; feel of the serum.  Put the gooey stuff on (remember a little bit goes a long way), smooth it in, and then I go brush my teeth or work on my hair.  It takes it a few minutes to be absorbed, but then your skin feels incredibly soft with no gooeyness.</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my face feel so smooth without feeling greasy. I am prone to acne. The Wexler products have actually helped keep it under control!</li>
    <li> This is a great cream that I love and recommend to may people. A little really does go along way so only us a little, otherwise that is where the greasy feel can come from. People noticed a difference in my face in just one week. Like this cream for keeping up my 32 year old face.</li>
    <li> I did like this cream. You only need to use very little on a damp face.</li>
    <li> This is my second jar of this wonder serum.  I think it&#x27;s the best out there for filling in crease lines in your face.  Put it on, and 20 minutes later, you look like a new person!  Someone was selling some other company&#x27;s product and asked if I was interested.  I said &amp;#34;no, thanks, I just spent a small fortune on (this) product.  She didn&#x27;t ask what the product was, but instead said, &amp;#34;whatever you are using, it works great!&amp;#34;  I have to agree.</li>
    <li> I love the Wexler serum. I put it on after washing my face and before moisturizer. It&#x27;s a great&lt;br /&gt;product and makes my face feel so soft. The best serum out there as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> Been using this serum for years and love how soft it makes my skin.</li>
    <li> Product arrive on time and as promised. This serum has made my face baby skin soft and appear years younger. I haven&#x27;t found anything else that compares. I wear it under my moisturizer but make sure you let the serum absorb before layering with the moisturizer and foundation.</li>
    <li> I would not use anything else on my skin.  I am 67 and have plump soft skin and only a wrinkle around the mouth to give me away.  Have been using this for years.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever!!! It&#x27;s for all skin types, but if u are the type with drier skin, I&#x27;d used some moisturizer in case it becomes irritating. But the skin will get used to it. And you will forever buy this product. I have my whole family on it. My 60-y.o. Dad uses the entire tub in a month because he loves it so much. And he used to be a Nivea guy. Not anymore!! He looks smooth!!</li>
    <li> This product keeps the skin feeling the same as when first applied. I have used this product for 6 years and am100% happy!</li>
    <li> good product w good price that help buyer &#x27;s pocket.It&#x27;s too true to be that price .Everybody deserve good product with reasonable price since we use a lot .Thanks.</li>
    <li> This serum is great over other moisturizers that are more fluid.  Used it for years and will never be without it.</li>
    <li> I have used the serum for 10 years, it&#x27;s amazing.  I always receive complements about my skin</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel smooth as velvet. My husband has also started using it and says that it is the best moisturizer he&#x27;s ever tried.</li>
    <li> I was given a samply of this product about 4 years ago at our mall during the Black Friday sale.  I have used it every since.  When Bath &amp; Body works stopped selling it in their stores, I started buying it online, and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I believe my skin is softer and the spots are lightening. I lunched with my sister and immediately wanted to know what she was doing, her face glowed. You can go without makeup! We&#x27;re in our 60&#x27;s! We always spf, but sometimes you just want to go natural.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for dry skin.  Extremely concentrated and last a long time.  Cheaper than Bath &amp; Body works, which is the only place I have found this product.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy.  Skin absorbs the moisture and make you feel so soft.  I love Wexler products.  Softens the skin which softens the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This feels amazing on the skin, and I really like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have any scent.</li>
    <li> You will love the texture of this product.  It goes fast, remarkable results,&lt;br /&gt;You see and feel the changes daily especially deep wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;You will notice a firmer face daily, even under your chin and neck.&lt;br /&gt;I love all of patricia wexler&#x27;s products but this is my most cherished one.&lt;br /&gt;I will never be without it.</li>
    <li> I have no idea what this stuff is or what it does, but my wife must love it.  Every time I get ready to place an order to Amazon, she adds this to it.  It must be some good stuff for as much as it costs, and as little as you get.  I just wish I new how to make it.  I&#x27;d be a millionaire.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is the best product I have used in all my 49 years of using facial moisturizers. I use it at night after a shower to hydrate my skin. It is not greasy, oily, or watery. It has a perfect consistency and once you place a small dab on your face and blend it in, you can instantly feel the ingredients soaking into your skin re-hydrating and neutralizing your skin. I have oily to normal skin but after showering my face becomes flaky, itchy and tight. But this moisturizer delivers intense hydration that lasts all day without causing me breakouts or greasiness. I absolutely love it and I have become a faithful customer forever.</li>
    <li> Definitely a 5-start product!!</li>
    <li> This is the first renewal serum I have used,so I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare with.My husband bought this for me 3 years ago from bath and body works for my birthday.Since then I have continued using it.It makes my skin soft and smooth,I can&#x27;t imagine what will happen to my skin without it.This is the best thing that ever happened to my face,love it love it!!!!!On amazon its half the price compared to bath and body works..</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.. just like what you buy in store</li>
    <li> An easy to access gel serum, it goes on smoothly and seems to work well. The large container should last awhile, and the price was a bonus. For travel, the gel can easily be placed in a smaller jar. I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve resolved to replace any of my make up and cleaning products that are animal tested with cruelty free brands.  When I ran out of my night time serum (from a well known brand with a French name often referred to by 3 initials) I choose the Patricia Wexler Intensive Night Reversal and Repair cream.  After a week my skin felt noticeably softer and more supple.  I decided to go ahead and begin using her full line and not wait for all my products to run out.  The skin regenerating serum is GREAT!  Just a tiny bit goes a long way and I use it 2x day on my face, neck and down to my collar bones.  It&#x27;s amazing how much softer and smoother my skin feels.  It&#x27;s also less expensive than what I was using so it&#x27;s a good deal all around!  Definitely recommend this line.</li>
    <li> Age: 56&lt;br /&gt;Skin Type: slightly sensitive with a little bit of rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I found this serum for an amazing price on Amazon! I&#x27;d previously purchased it somewhere else, for half price--the original price of $150 is a bit much for me to pay. At half the price or less, it&#x27;s definitely worth every penny. When I ran out recently (and it lasts a long long long time if you use it properly), I found it on sale on Amazon--WHUPOW! I purchased right away--of course, as always, Amazon is amazing in their ability to mail a product with lightning speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is very thick - a pinkish color - and you do not need much of this product, for a little goes a long way. If you use too much, the product will \\&quot;sit on your face\\&quot; and feel too \\&quot;tacky.\\&quot; As you smooth it onto your face (and throat --and any left on my fingers I rub into the backs of my hands), it does feel a little thick, but just keep smoothing it onto your face. After, you may feel as if the product has not \\&quot;soaked in\\&quot; but give it five to ten minutes or so. I wouldn&#x27;t apply it right before bed but at least ten to fifteen minutes before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying, I notice right away a \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; of my skin - I suppose it&#x27;s hydrating, but it acts almost like a primer, preparing your skin for the next product--which, for me is a moisturizer. At times, however, I will use only the serum over my clean face. Try using your Clarisonic (I have the Mia) first, and then while your face is exfoliated, and still slightly damp after blotting it dry, smooth on a tiny pea-sized (one of those tiny peas, not the big ass peas!) portion of the serum. If you are going to apply moisturizer and/or make-up, as I said, wait a little bit, ten minutes or so, to let the serum soak into your skin. Not everyone may like the thickness of the product and how it feels on the skin, but to me, it&#x27;s worth it. My skin feels softer and smoother, and it does help the appearance -- I won&#x27;t say it makes any fine lines completely disappear, but there is a noticeable difference in how your skin will appear after using this product regularly for a few weeks, and with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a HUGE jar--it&#x27;s a lot of product, so don&#x27;t be put off by the price. Think of it this way--- I was purchasing a serum in a much smaller tube for a much smaller price, but when I figured out the PER OUNCE price I was paying, I actually paid a little more for the smaller tube of serum! So, if you have the money to shell out to purchase this product in the bigger jar (not at the original price, but at half-price or less), you will save money in the long run, and you&#x27;ll have an amazing product.</li>
    <li> love this product for my face. it makes my face glow and it hydrates it. I know it is a bit expensive but it is worth it</li>
    <li> Best face junk known to man!</li>
    <li> I love the Patricia Wexler skin care line, and this serum is the best part of the line.  (Recently she discontinued several items, which made me very unhappy.)  The price on this was very good, the item arrived earlier than promised, and it was in  perfect condition.</li>
    <li> My wife LOVES this stuff.  I have no idea what it does, and I know it costs a lot for a tiny little jar, but she says its GREAT!</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Used Wexler products for years&#x3D;great.</li>
    <li> Works great at a great price.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and I get so many compliments on the way my complexion looks. One jar lasts forever and spreads so easily.</li>
    <li> This pink magic potion feels SOOO good when applied to my dry face....I live in a dry climate and this makes my face and neck feel very moist.</li>
    <li> I have been using Patricia Wexler products for several years now, and they are absolutely fantastic!  The serum replenishes the moisture in your skin, and if I&#x27;m just hanging around the house, it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll put on.  The day and night creams are excellent as well.  The price SEEMS expensive, but you use so little, that it lasts several months.  I recommend Patricia Wexler products to everyone!</li>
    <li> Excellent product--I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Great value as well.</li>
