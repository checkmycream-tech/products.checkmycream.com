      <li>This made me super happy and felt great that I was getting the comments.</li>
      <li>Just love it!</li>
      <li>A nice creamy product.  </li>
      <li>My search for an effective under eye treatment continues.</li>
      <li>I guess that would have been nice</li>
      <li>Tlhe under eye cream has a  very refreshing feeling and easy to wear under makeup.  </li>
      <li>This is very light and keeps the area underneath the eyes moist.</li>
      <li>Luckily you can screw off the top and get the remaining product out from the bottom of the container which is a good thing at $30 plus for .5 of an once.</li>
      <li>This should not cost more than $10.</li>
      <li>so you would run out of serum and have to buy more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many serums.</li>
      <li>This cream pumped out nice and smooth and went on evenly.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping that the longer I use it the more results I will see.  </li>
      <li>I am giving it more time to&lt;br /</li>
      <li>most of them don&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>This one is a bit better.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;m using it for just one, I can also confidently review that this eye serum is absorbed well with good coverage on both the forehead and decolletage.     </li>
      <li>I forgot) for free!</li>
      <li>I end up with ALOT more serum than I need</li>
      <li>I guess I should not have gone for the cheap stuff !</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it until it runs out and see if it gets better.</li>
      <li>I suffer more from puffiness than circles, but do still have circles.</li>
      <li>Each pump gives about 4 times more serum than I need for both eyes.  </li>
      <li>or if I&#x27;m feeling okay.</li>
      <li>you will love it.   </li>
      <li>Interesting fact is when you get this product there is a note inside the box which says \\&quot;if</li>
      <li>The way its designed it forces you to squirt out way much more than needed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they did this on purpose</li>
      <li>This cream does an ok</li>
      <li>but now I have baggy eyes thanks to this product!!!!</li>
      <li>Can really see improvement, feels good going on my face.</li>
      <li>Seller most definitely wants to please!!!</li>
      <li>Easy to put on and not greasy.</li>
      <li>it is easily mistaken for a line of Prevage.</li>
      <li>Nice product for an older eye or an eye that shows stress, rings, puffiness, and much more.</li>
      <li>I thought the pump on this bottle was totally fine</li>
      <li>It may be a fine product</li>
      <li>Within a week I saw a huge difference with the discoloration under my eyes and the puffiness.</li>
      <li>The product I have purchased has been great and worked out as expected or better.  </li>
      <li>NO fragrances is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>That is probably why it was so cheap.</li>
      <li>You will enjoy it.  </li>
      <li>I guess this stuff is better fresh.</li>
      <li>It sticks, so when it breaks free, it shoots across the room.  </li>
      <li>So far this product is a good serum.</li>
      <li>Though the pricing is good, it isn&#x27;t so good when 3/4 of it is wasted on the sink or floor.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>I have only used it for a few days, so do not know the results in that area yet, but it has a very nice feel, massages in nicely, and does a great job of reflecting light.</li>
      <li>No bad chemicals or whitening agents, just good old fashioned ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many other eye products and so far this has been the best.</li>
      <li>When I look at photos from 2 years ago, I can really see a huge change!</li>
      <li>Not alot of product for the money but is good to buy this ones to try before buying the larger one.</li>
      <li>I have tried many eye creams and this one really does the job.</li>
      <li>and you cannot tell if it&#x27;s a full bottle.  </li>
      <li>better than even Murad and absorbs really well.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s true, a lot comes out with one pump</li>
      <li>And, quite  honestly, it seemed to create eye puffiness that I did not previously have as a result of using it.</li>
      <li>Eye Revival has helped tremendously.</li>
      <li>SUPER product.</li>
      <li>but I have every confidence in the product and look forward to the same amazing results.)  </li>
      <li>I guess the best you can say is that it doesn&#x27;t make anything worse.</li>
      <li>My friend gave me a bottle of Eye Revival as a gift since she used it with success too.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really see significant improvement.  </li>
      <li>I am a believer, and the price is right.  </li>
      <li>No serum that really works can do it that quickly.</li>
      <li>I am 51 years old and people think I look about 40, however, if I don&#x27;t use a good eye cream I will definitely be puffy underneath the eyes...</li>
      <li>I have done many researches and nothing seemed to be promising so far.</li>
      <li>So far its visably noticable that the puffiness and fine lines are deminishing.  </li>
      <li>Works pretty good, takes a little longer to absorbe into your skin before it starts to work.  </li>
      <li>When you are mid forties to 50&#x27;s, we women need a better product which is targeted towards our age and also stress, health, lifestyle and diet.  </li>
      <li>This works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, this serum is for real so try it if you need help under your eyes!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Shame on you Amazon for sneaking this product in the very beginning of the Prevage line!</li>
      <li>The last bottle I received was a serum, this is more like a lotion.  </li>
      <li>I am not using it that long however, So far so good.</li>
      <li>and you get way more than you actually need.  </li>
      <li>I saw no difference at all after using it consistently for 2 months.  </li>
      <li>A great amount of the product is rendered unusable thanks to the shoddy dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ordered this product as a birthday present for my aunt after reading several good reviews about it.   </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> don&#x27;t know, my wife uses it</li>
    <li> I used it for over a month and saw no change in my under eye circles, puffiness, or wrinkles. Plus, the cream had an unpleasant odor. I&#x27;m using a different product now through Olay that actually produces results.</li>
    <li> This product did NOTHING for dark circles but I did notice a difference with eye puffiness. I used this product every day for a month. I would not recommend this if you want to use it for dark circles. I didn&#x27;t like the pump bottle, it always squirted out way too much and it just got wasted. It smelled strange too.</li>
    <li> If you do a search for Prevage Eye this off-brand is the THIRD item displayed. \\&quot;Eye Revivial\\&quot; is so generic it is easily mistaken for a line of Prevage. It may be a fine product but I feel really ripped off, especially since I will have paid $10 in shipping fees (25% of the item cost) when I do a return -- and I have nothing.  Shame on you Amazon for sneaking this product in the very beginning of the Prevage line!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the results I was hoping for from this product.  I was hopeful, reading the reviews of others, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.    I applied this product twice a day for 5 weeks and really did not see any difference.  I would say that my dark circles or puffiness were not diminished at all.    I did find the lotion to be non-irritating and non-drying but as far as lightening the dark circles under my eyes, it was not effective.    I&#x27;ll also agree that the pump design is awful.  Even when I carefully and slowly depressed the pump, lotion still shot across the bathroom.  I stopped using the pump and simply unscrewed the top and tipped a small amount of lotion directly onto my finger.    My search for an effective under eye treatment continues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 2 weeks and had minimal improvement.  I&#x27;ll keep using it until it runs out and see if it gets better.</li>
    <li> The serum itself is very good, absorbs well and performs as advertised. Unfortunately the bottle&#x27;s cheap pump sticks, clogs, breaks or messily leaks and squirts it around without delivering a consistent, measured amount. Result is lots of serum waste which, at the price, is not acceptable. Put it in a simple tube, guys. I don&#x27;t plan to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This product has not worked either to reduce my dark circles or the fine lines that have started to appear under my eyes. The fine lines have actually got worse since I started using this serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for 3 months now.  Don&#x27;t really see significant improvement.  It does kind of keeping my dark eye circle from getting worst though.  When I first received the product, I was very disappointed.  The package was torned and winkle.  I was surprised that the bottle did not get lost in mail.  There was no seal for the product and you cannot tell if it&#x27;s a full bottle.  There was no way to know if I was getting an used product.  I&#x27;m getting ready to buy another one.  But definitely not buying this one again.  I have done many researches and nothing seemed to be promising so far.</li>
    <li> This product appears to be diminishing my dark circles, but the jury is still out.</li>
    <li> The product may be OK - but the dispenser pump is terrible.  You have no control over how much comes out and you get way more than you actually need.  It is very frustrating to use because of this, so I will not order it again,</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product.  I have used it for the past 2 weeks and it has not reduce my dark circles at all.  And, quite  honestly, it seemed to create eye puffiness that I did not previously have as a result of using it.</li>
    <li> After I finished the first vial of Eye Revival, I could see absolutely no difference in the puffiness or the blue circles under my eyes. I had to give it one star because my review was not accepted without it.</li>
    <li> This cream does an ok job-  helps more with puffiness than the dark circles.  My real problem with it is that the pump-type delivery system is not easy to control.  I end up with ALOT more serum than I need so I end up using it on my whole face.  For that reason alone, I will not purchase this product again-- too wasteful.</li>
    <li> A very small sample of this product was sent to me via mail.  I tried it on just one side of my face and was truly amazed!!  I immediately went to Amazon and ordered the product.  I&#x27;m only a few days in to application, but look forward to the continuing results of my first try.  Immediately the puffiness is gone...the smile wrinkles are less pronounced...and I&#x27;m looking forward to the reduction of the circles under my eyes.  (Results being a little hard to notice as some days they seem less than others...but I have every confidence in the product and look forward to the same amazing results.)  Try it...you will love it.   JG</li>
    <li> I was looking for something less expensive than the $90 eye cream I&#x27;ve been using and I did a lot of online research and purchased this.  My eyes would dry up on the edges after four hours and it did nothing for dark circles.  Not very moisturizing at all, and so many comments on the bottle.....it&#x27;s true, a lot comes out with one pump and you can&#x27;t really put it back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pass on this, ladies......</li>
    <li> I have been using this product to reduce my dark circles, not only it did not help but now I have baggy eyes thanks to this product!!!! Interesting fact is when you get this product there is a note inside the box which says \\&quot;if you give us a good feedback on Amazon we will send you a free facial cream\\&quot;! Now, up to you to trust the reviews!</li>
    <li> I tried this for about a month. I suffer more from puffiness than circles, but do still have circles. When I opened the package, there was a nice little note. Apparently, if I leave a four star review I will get bottle of a different product (probably moisturizer - I forgot) for free! Yea! Another bottle of something that doesn&#x27;t work. I guess that would have been nice had it worked, but obviously if it worked - you wouldn&#x27;t have to ask for four star reviews. I finally ordered the Preparation H from Canada - it contains the ingredient that helps with the puffiness that the US has taken out. The Eye Revival is however good for foundation for eye makeup concealer, hence the two stars! Save your money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money if you&#x27;re looking for something to take the puffiness away. Just doesn&#x27;t work. I does however lighten the dark circles a bit.</li>
    <li> This product is ok, but should have been better if you can press wihout too much serum coming out, thereby wasting the serum, since you only need a little bit.  i have been using this for 2 weeks now but still have puffiness.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT HAD SOME CONCERNS THE COMPANY GOT BACK INTOUCH WITH ME PROMPTLY AND HANDLE MY CONCERNS IN AN EXPEDISHOUS MANNER.I DEFINITELY WILL RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY</li>
    <li> I used this product 2x per day every day for 6 weeks and is simply did not work.  Dark circles under my eyes are as dark as ever.</li>
    <li> Tlhe under eye cream has a  very refreshing feeling and easy to wear under makeup.  Cant wait to see how it works in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> i got this serum im using couple weeks morning and night but still same  no result yet ,i could not see any changes bought 3 of them</li>
    <li> I have tried at least 2 other products that did not work for me because I am very sensitive to chemicals and even plant materials in cosmetics. This has occured to me even with cosmetics that claim to be hypoallergenic. Eye Revival not only worked to moisturize and reduce the circles under my eyes but also did not produce any allergic reactions. I am overjoyed that I have found a product that works and that I can use long term. No more wasted time or money!</li>
    <li> Ok..it&#x27;s been a month since I&#x27;ve been using this (morning and night), dark circles, puffiness, lines...all still here.  Should have saved my money and bought coverup instead.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream based on the reviews&lt;br /&gt;wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle, didn&#x27;t get one&lt;br /&gt;puffiness did go down but not away, didn&#x27;t do any thing for my dark circles and did ok on the wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be giving it 4 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the \\&quot;airless\\&quot; pump it shoots out too much product and it will splatter if not careful</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it was so highly rated. I found that it worked well. I was disappointed that was a pump dispenser because it would distribute more product than I needed which meant that I used it up way too fast. Luckily you can screw off the top and get the remaining product out from the bottom of the container which is a good thing at $30 plus for .5 of an once. I would not buy it again because I think I can get the same results at half the price but it did work well.</li>
    <li> darkness was reduced.  bags under eyes are no different after two weeks of use.  I am giving it more time to&lt;br /&gt; truly evaluate product. The small pump bottle does not work well.  It spits, not smooth flow of liquid.</li>
    <li> So far its visably noticable that the puffiness and fine lines are deminishing.  Hopefully the dark circles will follow...just recieved it and will give it fair time.</li>
    <li> I have been using the eye revival for 2 months now and it really does work. All of my under eye lines are gone so as the dark circles. I have tried many other eye products and so far this has been the best. Excellent, responsive customer service too. They resolved my issue as soon as I contacted. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> A nice creamy product.  Does not reduce my under-eye puffyness, but may have some effect on wrinkles.  Too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> I have used this every day twice a day since I received this 20 days ago.  Nothing happens.  The dark circles have not changed one bit.  I doubt if it is going to work at all, but I will continue another 10 days and then I give up.</li>
    <li> They complicated the pump way too much so that you can&#x27;t control the amount coming out regardless of how careful you are.  It sticks, so when it breaks free, it shoots across the room.  Very poor packaging design leaves casts a horrible shadow on what may be otherwise a good product.  Though the pricing is good, it isn&#x27;t so good when 3/4 of it is wasted on the sink or floor.</li>
    <li> it works!  better than even Murad and absorbs really well.  I am a believer, and the price is right.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have used this Eye Revial serum for four weeks. I used it AM and PM.  Just ran out.  It did nothing for me.  I was very hopeful.  It should be packaged differently.  Too much squirts out at one time. For the price it ran out too fast.</li>
    <li> I paid $40 for this and it only lasted 3 weeks - not long enough for that kind of money and not long enough to really tell if it was helping.  Won&#x27;t buy again at that price.  And I just used a tiny dab for each eye.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for months and I can see no visible difference.  I guess I should not have gone for the cheap stuff !</li>
    <li> I am well impressed by this product.&lt;br /&gt;I just began to use and the good effects is already showing. The shadows around my eyes begin to clear. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was sad to say that when I got my item the date on it was only one month from being expired. I used it every day for a month afterwards and I didn&#x27;t see any results. I guess this stuff is better fresh. I got it on a discount. That is probably why it was so cheap. They needed to hurry up and get rid of it</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for almost a 1 year now. It works MUCH better than any other product I have tried before. I am 45 and I have had a problem with dark circles most of my life- even as a teenager. As I got older, the puffiness only accentuated the problem. I started trying every cream on the market with minimal success. Then I tried Eye Revival. What a difference! I even gave up my other expensive eye cream since this one is less expensive. The dark circles are virtually gone and (when I get enough sleep) the puffiness too. SUPER product. For those who said they used it for \\&quot;a few days\\&quot; and saw no difference. Give it a little more time. No serum that really works can do it that quickly. Though I saw some improvement in 2 weeks, it took about 3 weeks before I saw the major difference starting to occur. When I look at photos from 2 years ago, I can really see a huge change!</li>
    <li> Eye Revival Age Defying Eye Serum - Great product.  You&#x27;ll love it.  Seller most definitely wants to please!!!</li>
    <li> I was hoping for some help with dark under-eye circles.  I used this on one eye and my normal eye stuff on the other for about 6 weeks now.  So far this serum hasn&#x27;t done better or worse.      The really disappointing thing has been the design of the pump.  Each pump gives about 4 times more serum than I need for both eyes.  Since I&#x27;m using it for just one, I can also confidently review that this eye serum is absorbed well with good coverage on both the forehead and decolletage.     It also has a tendency to come out with enough force to splash off your finger/palm entirely and end up 1/2 way across the room.  While utterly entertaining, I could do this with my faucet and a piece of tape for less than $40.</li>
    <li> I read about the great results people were getting from Eye Revival and so I decided to give it a try. I have not had much luck with the under eye creams lately and my eyes have been getting darker and puffy from so much stress (family &amp; work). I got my order on a monday and by Saturday my dark circles were almost gone and the puffiness too! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I thought the pump on this bottle was totally fine so I do not know what the other reviewers were talking about. The serum came out nice and slow like it should. Anyway, this serum is for real so try it if you need help under your eyes!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product as a birthday present for my aunt after reading several good reviews about it.   I thought allowing 1 week for delivery would be enough time to receive it before her birthday but shipping was slow and I didn&#x27;t get it until after her birthday passed.  My aunt has been using the product regularly but has not seen or felt any difference so overall I&#x27;m not very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Just wrote a review for another under eye product and gave it 1 star. This one is a bit better. Life extension has one but it&#x27;s a complete joke.</li>
    <li> After toning, moisturizing, setting and all, I use it around my eyes, esp.  under the eyes for dark circles and bags under the eyes.  Just love it!</li>
    <li> Eye Revival was recommended to me from my dermatologist because I have sensitive skin. He said this serum is great for my skin condition and will work without any side effects. I have only found one other eye cream to work before but it was very expensive. This cream pumped out nice and smooth and went on evenly. Cream has no smell which I like. NO fragrances is a huge plus. Eye puffiness started to diminish by the next day too so I am very happy.</li>
    <li> The serum seems to work but the dispenser squirts out enough to cover parts of my face. There is a problem with the dispenser mechanism. The serum won&#x27;t last anytime at this rate. Very wasteful!I wanted a replacement but they can&#x27;t do that. I&#x27;m afraid to order another one as I don&#x27;t want this to happen again. Has anyone had this issue?</li>
    <li> Do not be fooled by the sale price. I thought I was getting a good deal. Nope. This should not cost more than $10. Worst dispenser ever. I saw the reviews about the dispenser being awful. Yet I thought it was just dumb people or there had to be a way to just squirt out a little. I was wrong. The way its designed it forces you to squirt out way much more than needed. I&#x27;m sure they did this on purpose so you would run out of serum and have to buy more. As a result I won&#x27;t even waste my time on this. Going in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I noticed much of an effect.</li>
    <li> Save your money - this does NOTHING. I saw no positive results at all. I guess the best you can say is that it doesn&#x27;t make anything worse.</li>
    <li> I \\&quot;took a chance\\&quot; on this product as I am VERY picky about what I use, having used natural or homeopathic treatments, supplements, etc. for over 60 years. My skin looks great (I will be 75 on my next birthday, and people generally guess me at about 55), however I just had cataract surgery on both eyes and was interested in reducing the puffiness under my eyes. I have only used it for a few days, so do not know the results in that area yet, but it has a very nice feel, massages in nicely, and does a great job of reflecting light. My skin seems to say, \\&quot;let&#x27;s keep doing this, this feels very nice.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance of the company selling this item was excellent, and I could recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> The last bottle I received was a serum, this is more like a lotion.  I don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Has helped with the puffiness.</li>
    <li> I am an eye cream addict.  I have tried just about any eye product that promises to reduce puffiness around the eye area.  I started having this problem after my thyroid stopped working (slowed my metabolism).  The problem is ...most of them just don&#x27;t do anything. Since the eyes are \\&quot;the windows to your soul\\&quot;; you want people to notice your bright,healthy and beautiful eyes. This is the only product that hydrates the eye area,reduces puffiness under and above the eye and darkness under the eye.  When I run out of it, I can see the difference.  Since this eye serum can be pricey, only Amazon can provide my fix. I am a real fan of Eye Revival.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purcahsed this eye serum. At 61, I have quite a few wrinkles at the corners of my eyes, plus puffiness. Eye Revival has helped tremendously. I&#x27;ve tried many serums. I rank this one as #1.</li>
    <li> The squirt bottle bottle this came in doesn&#x27;t seem to work so I have to always open the bottle to use it (otherwise would have been a 5 star review).  The product seems to work well for my under eye circles and puffiness.</li>
    <li> I bought this product expecting it to help with the dark circles under my eyes.  I didn&#x27;t do anything. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how big of a difference this makes.  I noticed a change in darkness the next day.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Works pretty good, takes a little longer to absorbe into your skin before it starts to work.  Not alot of product for the money but is good to buy this ones to try before buying the larger one.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when i bought this, I have tried numerous other products and paid a lot of money. This product really works. Within a week I saw a huge difference with the discoloration under my eyes and the puffiness. I will definitely continue to use this product. Easy to put on and not greasy. A great product!!</li>
    <li> Product:  I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to give a statement on it&#x27;s overall quality.  Would like to give it a fair chance before reporting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dispenser:  Well if you like the product shooting all over your walls and in large quantities, you won&#x27;t have an issue.  I prefer the dispenser to actually work properly and not have to wipe it off my bathroom walls and shower curtain.  A great amount of the product is rendered unusable thanks to the shoddy dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer:  Please, I am begging you, please do something about the dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have tried all the most expensive eye creams, and none of a few of them contain chemicals which whitening compounds...I have always had issues with dark rings due to medications I take for Crohn&#x27;s, and you can really tell when I truly am NOT feeling well.  I tried Ol*y and not happy with it, in fact, I got an eye infection from it...tried a VERY costly product by Mur*d, did not work.  The others are too thick and don&#x27;t allow for easy makeup application.  Some products profess to be great, but they depict a girl in her 20&#x27;s.  When you are mid forties to 50&#x27;s, we women need a better product which is targeted towards our age and also stress, health, lifestyle and diet.  This so far, is working, use twice a day.  You will enjoy it.  No bad chemicals or whitening agents, just good old fashioned ingredients.  So far, I&#x27;m liking it.  Will update my report in another 4 weeks.  Nice product for an older eye or an eye that shows stress, rings, puffiness, and much more.</li>
    <li> The product I have purchased has been great and worked out as expected or better.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well.  You have to remember to use this twice a day or results will come slow.</li>
    <li> tried 2 times a day bottle very small, not much in it, wife said i told you so no difference disapointed in results</li>
    <li> neutral, not ordering it agaiin thankyou</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of eye creams that say they will reduce puffiness and dark circles....most of them don&#x27;t.  The Eye Revival Age Deying Eye Serum delivers on their promises!!  I have used this product for about 2 weeks, and can definitely see a difference.  The skin around my eyes is tighter and the circles less apparent, all without drying my skin.  I&#x27;m hoping that the longer I use it the more results I will see.  It is moderately priced and the seller delivered in a timely fashion.  I have been very pleased and will purchase again</li>
    <li> It may have somewhat reduced the dark circles. which is why I tried it.  It did not cause any problems for my sensitive prone skin.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day, twice per day. sometimes I use it before my moisturizer and sometimes after. It has been about one month now and there seems to be some progress in lightening up the dark circles. It has reduced the dark circle closer to the outside of my eyes rather than the inside. Maybe it takes longer than one month to show significant overall difference.&lt;br /&gt;The pump is difficult to use because it sticks, then pumps out way more than I need, so I feel I am wasting my purchased product. It also smells like citronella to me and made the inside of my left eye kinda itchy. I will use it until it is gone then probably try something else.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews on this product I thought I would give it a try.  Save your money, this product does not work!!  I saw no difference at all after using it consistently for 2 months.  I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money, just thought I would warn others.</li>
    <li> I have tried some of the most expensive Eye cremes ever. I tried Amore Pacific which was pricey but did not work. I also tried a few others including Olay which left my eyes very puffy. So far this product is a good serum. I am not using it that long however, So far so good. I am 51 years old and people think I look about 40, however, if I don&#x27;t use a good eye cream I will definitely be puffy underneath the eyes... the dark rings are frightening.  People usually ask me if I sleep well or if I&#x27;m feeling okay. That is usually a key indication that you&#x27;re not using the right skin care and eye care products. This is very light and keeps the area underneath the eyes moist. I also use it on the lid crease as well with no allergic reaction.  The Olay professional Pro X complex gave me an irritation of the eyes. I have also tried Nip + Fab dark circle fix cream which really did not work well. So far I rate this one the highest and right under that I rate Rozg&amp;eacute; Vanilyx. Dr Murads is not good, nor is Clinique or Dr Brandt, Which was very very costly.</li>
    <li> I have dark puffy bags under my eyes and have searched for a cream that would help me for a long time. My friend gave me a bottle of Eye Revival as a gift since she used it with success too. I was applying the cream in morning and night and I began to see some results by the 5th day. My bags were going away and the dark circles were getting lighter too. I kept using the cream and by the 12th day the difference was so dramatic that everyone I worked with was commenting on my eyes. This made me super happy and felt great that I was getting the comments. My confidence and self esteem were sky high too. I do not know what in this cream made it work so well but you need to try this stuff!</li>
    <li> Can really see improvement, feels good going on my face.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye creams and this one really does the job. The price is reasonable through Amazon. This stuff really works. I have sensitive eyes and was pleasantly surprised to find it did not cause irritation.</li>
