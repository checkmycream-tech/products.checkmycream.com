      <li>Honestly, the $6 Walgreen curl cream works better than this stuff.</li>
      <li>So far this product is the best I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
      <li>but I do love how this product gives me the results that I am looking for when I do spiral curls</li>
      <li>This will hold your curls,  but it may be better to wash it out.</li>
      <li>I personally love the smell of the product and don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
      <li>Hair is healthy.</li>
      <li>I know love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It also seemed to make it tangle more.</li>
      <li>While I love the fruity smell, this is not the product for my hair.</li>
      <li>Wonderful Product can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t use more then about a teaspoon amount on my hair.  </li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to make of it,</li>
      <li>I purchased this before I read the reviews and now I am pleased I did.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Any who, I  love it</li>

      <li>I tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curly Pudding in the free samples via their website.</li>
      <li>so I took advantage of the buy 1 get 1 free campaign on the MJ website.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought it at Target for $22 for an 8 oz jar.  </li>
      <li>Glad I checked on here before buying it again at Target as it is such a better deal on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Several of my friends use CP and love it, but I don&#x27;t want any more of my curls to lose their life</li>
      <li>I recommend getting the free samples first.</li>
      <li>If anyone is interested in getting these products from me, please feel free to reply to this review.</li>
      <li>Okay, I have been using this for 2mths, but now I am looking for a new product.</li>
      <li>I purchased mine at a Target (Broadview, IL), but according to most of the reviews, so far this just looks like some whipped butter with grape kool-aid flavoring and probably not a bad batch.</li>
      <li>I have short 4A hair and had been using Jane Carter&#x27;s Curling Cream and thought it was pretty good.</li>
      <li>you are using way to much!!</li>
      <li>The first few times I used it, I LOVED it!</li>
      <li>My curls were even more defined and still soft.</li>
      <li>I know for sure that one lady has a perm in her hair but claims it to be natural and uses MJ&#x27;s product on permed hair and gets the results that you may want.  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ve spend about $70 trying to get a nice curly look but back to the braids for the summer.  </li>
      <li>but this is so worth the money.  </li>
      <li>My hair was still soft from the moisturized and my hair can be pretty brittle, so that turned out ok.</li>
      <li>More than likely I&#x27;ll have to cut it off and start from scratch.</li>
      <li>The first picture is now .</li>
      <li>I brought it near my home, for the not so cheap price of $8.</li>
      <li>Those of you with my hair type would appreciate the joy of discovering a product that actually adds moisture to hair that can easily become dry and coarse.</li>
      <li>I have a 4c coiled hair type which is the most senstive and dry</li>
      <li>Instead, my hair came out poufy and continued to expand to amazing levels as it dried.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the products, I&#x27;ve turned my friends on to it,&lt;br /&gt;everyone</li>
      <li>Washed my hair and conditioned the hair and tried the product, as this product was drying, my hair was very spongy and did not have the curl that I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d heard so much about Miss Jessie&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Im in transition, so my hair is still straight on the ends.</li>
      <li>as i put too much in my hair.  </li>
      <li>I tried it a second time because one of the reviewers suggested that most people simply use too much product</li>
      <li>I did notice was that at first MJCP had my hair reaaaalllly soft.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After a couple of weeks of use, I noticed that after shampooing my hair that there were sections that had completely lost its curl pattern and was borderline straight.</li>
      <li>I just went all natural, and rinse my hair in the morning, put some product in, and walk out (which is very convenient) &amp; it curls on</li>
      <li>I normally use Kinky Curly curling custard in the mornings for a wash and go.</li>
      <li>I got the large regular CP which does smell very grape like.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s on to a new product for me.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
      <li>The texture of my hair is very soft and spongy.</li>
      <li>No shrinkage period, no flakes, and my curls are soft and curly!</li>
      <li>Not only did it leave my hair feeling like straw but more importantly made it look worse than if I had used nothing at all.</li>
      <li>Can be pricey, and the scent can be a little strong.</li>
      <li>I will definitely purchase the large container now.</li>
      <li>and they were not stiff.  </li>
      <li>Anyways like the instructions say, after I wash my hair I put a nice amount on three of my fingers and rub it on my little afro while pulling my curls through, and also while my hair is still WET.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 3c/4a and this did absolutely nothing, but leave a white flaky residue and create dandruff on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I noticed that Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curl Pudding made frequent appearances in those videos and decided to give it a try, as part of my twist out process.  </li>
      <li>, I have been natural for almost 3 years</li>
      <li>It detangles the hair, leaving it soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>my texture is extremely soft and sort of an \\&quot;S\\&quot; curl.</li>
      <li>I decided to use the MJ&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curl.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m newly natural</li>
      <li>and my hair was soft.  </li>
      <li>Basically if you do not have NATURALLY curly hair do not buy this product...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 4B, still early in my transition.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to say I don&#x27;t recommend it because there are many different tpyes and textures of black hair, so what works for one doesn&#x27;t necessarily work for others, and many women</li>
      <li>When I saw this product initially at a beauty supply, I saw it was geared more for dark afro type hair, my hair is very blonde and curly wavy</li>
      <li>It can make your hair a little dry (4 stars), so be sure to use a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It took almost 7 months for my true curl pattern to come through, and after a few weeks of using CP, my curls were obliterated:-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(Camille Rose, Shea Moisture, or raw shea), and had completely different results with other products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m currently trying to find products to revert my curls back to normal ...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this before I read the reviews and now I am pleased I did.  Amazon is where I buy, as well as,  research. I brought it near my home, for the not so cheap price of $8. I was worried after seeing the reviews, but it was too late to return. I decided to do a Bantu twist-out. Im in transition, so my hair is still straight on the ends. Use *Sparingly* was a common word in success stories,  so I took heed. I used a couple of small dabs on each dry knot. After doing knot #8, #3 was loose so I took it down to redo. To my surprise, my hair had Already set into a Deep S pattern!!  It can make your hair a little dry (4 stars), so be sure to use a moisturizer. I&#x27;ve used my bottle 10x, and that is only 1/4 the bottle. Never seen any flakes. My Sista,  this will indeed give you the curl control you need, in a matter of minutes!!  Remember, use just a little.      UPDATE (2/16/15: Okay, I have been using this for 2mths, but now I am looking for a new product. While I like the curl definition, it makes my hair stiff. It tends to break while combing. This will hold your curls,  but it may be better to wash it out. The good thing,  I still have quite a bit left. If you want to try it, I suggest you don&#x27;t comb your hair after use and always wash. Otherwise, you may see breakage.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, after wearing braids for 2 years, this year I decided to go natural and try some of the curly products on the market.  The texture of my hair is very soft and spongy. I tried Elasta QP Curling Pudding and that did nothing for my hair.I tried Kinky Curl - this left my hair with alot of white flakes and not the curl that I was looking for.  Then, I bought MJ&#x27;s Curling Pudding using small twist on wet hair, sat under the dryer for 1 hour as prescribed, took out the twist and it did not hold the curl, after seperating a curl or two, it began to frizz up.  I decided to use the MJ&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curl.  Washed my hair and conditioned the hair and tried the product, as this product was drying, my hair was very spongy and did not have the curl that I was looking for.  After watching enough vidoes on YouTube, I thought that I would have the same affect - DON&#x27;T BELIEVE THE HYPE, these woman have their hair already treated to react to the products.  I know for sure that one lady has a perm in her hair but claims it to be natural and uses MJ&#x27;s product on permed hair and gets the results that you may want.  So I&#x27;ve spend about $70 trying to get a nice curly look but back to the braids for the summer.  If anyone is interested in getting these products from me, please feel free to reply to this review. It would be my pleasure to pass along these products instead of having them sit.  I am proud to say that I have the cleaness hair in Brooklyn.</li>
    <li> The reason why this product has gotten a good amount of bad reviews is because the product is being used wrong. Reading directions will take you a long way. Now when i first got this product i HATED it because i didnt do certain things to my hair after i applied the pudding. Anyways like the instructions say, after I wash my hair I put a nice amount on three of my fingers and rub it on my little afro while pulling my curls through, and also while my hair is still WET. This products smells so good and I can literally see my curls expanding and the shrinkage dissappearing. After I&#x27;m done rubbing it in, I either tightly twist my hair, or put rubbers bands all over to let my hair AIR DRY. While its drying I apply a small amount of Hollywood beauty olive oil to each twist or rubber band puff, simply because my hair requires an oil because of how dry it gets. Once its done drying my hair looks amazing! No shrinkage period, no flakes, and my curls are soft and curly! Of course this product is expensive (although I bought my curly pudding at target for $23.00) It works very good for me because I&#x27;m following the directions. I don&#x27;t recommend blow drying your hair with this because you may definitely see flakes. I also recommend to twist the hair while it air drys with the pudding so that it locks moisture and the pudding in. Overall I like Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curly Pudding.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product can&#x27;t say enough about it. use daily</li>
    <li> I purchased the curly pudding about 3 weeks ago.  I&#x27;ve used it twice(once for twist outs and once to define my curls to just wear out) and both times my hair felt dried out and crunchy, and when you try to wash it out it kinda had this slimy feeling to it.  I will use the rest of the jar because it was expensive, but I will not be purchasing anything else from this line.  On a good note, it smells GREAT!!</li>
    <li> So I think some people are confused about this product. Basically if you do not have NATURALLY curly hair do not buy this product... it will not magically change the texture of your hair. Any who, I  love it, I have been natural for almost 3 years my texture is extremely soft and sort of an \\&quot;S\\&quot; curl. It defines and moisturizes my hair and does not leave it hard and crunchy like other brands. You should not apply it heavily because it will dampen and leave a white film in your hair. It smells great as well!</li>
    <li> I have short 4A hair and had been using Jane Carter&#x27;s Curling Cream and thought it was pretty good. I&#x27;d heard so much about Miss Jessie&#x27;s so I decided to start using the curly pudding. The first few times I used it, I LOVED it! It had good slip and really defined my coil out, and also eliminated a lot of the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of weeks of use, I noticed that after shampooing my hair that there were sections that had completely lost its curl pattern and was borderline straight. I&#x27;m newly natural so I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to make of it, but then I saw another Amazon reviewer mention that after using curly pudding some of her hair was straightened as well. I was horrified! It took almost 7 months for my true curl pattern to come through, and after a few weeks of using CP, my curls were obliterated:-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using it but some sections of my hair still haven&#x27;t recovered and I&#x27;m not sure that it will. More than likely I&#x27;ll have to cut it off and start from scratch. It&#x27;s extremely disappointing because I haven&#x27;t found another cream that has the same slip and shine as Miss Janky&#x27;s, but if I wanted straight hair I&#x27;d go back to a relaxer! Several of my friends use CP and love it, but I don&#x27;t want any more of my curls to lose their life so it&#x27;s on to a new product for me. Use with caution!</li>
    <li> I tried the unscented version of this product &amp; was actually blown away by the results.  My 2 strand twists were \\&quot;oingy boingy\\&quot; like stated on the label.  They were plump and shiny.  Before I applied it I washed my hair, conditioned &amp; put leave in conditioner; sectioned my wet hair &amp; applied MJCP to each section starting at the root.  I then dried my hair with a bonnet dryer.  After a week, I let it out &amp; had a well defined twist out for another week.  I&#x27;ved used it twice since then &amp; have been happy with the results. It is pricey so I took advantage of the buy 1 get 1 free campaign on the MJ website.  I got the large regular CP which does smell very grape like.  I found that with use my curl pattern was not relaxed but defined,  enhanced and I will continue to use these products.  My MJ products are not used for moisturization, however, but just for styling. I use H20 &amp; then seal with an oil mix or a variety of Carol&#x27;s daughter products.</li>
    <li> Seriously amazing curl cream...</li>
    <li> I bought this product a while back, but never used it. Then I got hooked on watching Youtube and the tutorials posted about doing twist outs and what products should be used on 4b/4c hair, which is my hair type. I noticed that Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curl Pudding made frequent appearances in those videos and decided to give it a try, as part of my twist out process.  I untwisted my hair, expecting curl definition and didn&#x27;t get it. Instead, my hair came out poufy and continued to expand to amazing levels as it dried. Essentially, I had a fright wig with little curls on the ends.  But I just figured that I did something wrong and had to tweak my process. No biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did notice was that at first MJCP had my hair reaaaalllly soft. Those of you with my hair type would appreciate the joy of discovering a product that actually adds moisture to hair that can easily become dry and coarse. However, just a few minutes later, my hair was drier than usual and had a crispy texture to it. I was so disappointed. MJCP was not cheap. I will continue to use my S-curl moisturizer. Laugh all you want, but that stuff works!!</li>
    <li> This is really the best product I have ever found for my daughter&#x27;s gorgeous curls, they never turn frizzy.  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> This product is OVER RATED and WAY over priced. Why in heaven&#x27;s name would I spend THAT much money on what is actually just equal parts curl activator gel, and cholesterol creme?&lt;br /&gt;Listen, there are plenty of other companies making a similar product for a fraction of the price, so why should I pay so much money? Over rated.</li>
    <li> Love it and can&#x27;t wait to test it with the beach/pool months ahead!!</li>
    <li> This product is the only thing that works for my daughter&#x27;s curls. And the delicious smell is amazing.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product.  Always on hand.</li>
    <li> Honestly, the $6 Walgreen curl cream works better than this stuff. Not only did it leave my hair feeling like straw but more importantly made it look worse than if I had used nothing at all. I tried it a second time because one of the reviewers suggested that most people simply use too much product so I tried using a lot less, but the results were the same. If crunchy frizzy hair had been the look I was going for...this product would&#x27;ve gotten five stars.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible. Yes it reduces frizz but  reducing frizz, it SHRINKS your hair. Before using this product, my curls would fall in my face. After using my curls shrunk and now I have an Afro. I&#x27;m currently trying to find products to revert my curls back to normal ...considering that this product made my curls disappear . there hasn&#x27;t been any hope. The first picture is now . The second picture is before use . DO NOT PURCHASE</li>
    <li> I just went all natural, and rinse my hair in the morning, put some product in, and walk out (which is very convenient) &amp; it curls on it&#x27;s own.  I&#x27;m still on the fence with this one.  It&#x27;s a bit heavier than some of the other products I&#x27;ve used. and I haven&#x27;t had time to use it, and sit under the dryer like it suggests.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice.  Once at the shop then once by  me.  My hair came out great at the shop...it was bouncing and my curls were stretched out and my hair was also very soft and moisturized.  When I did it myself it came about half the way the stylist at the shop did it.  My hair was still soft from the moisturized and my hair can be pretty brittle, so that turned out ok. But then a few curls here and there looked like they had lint in them, come to find out it was product...as i put too much in my hair.  The curls still came out a little stretched but not as much and my hair was soft.  So my conclusion is it will take sometime to get use to using this product properly so I get the result I got by going into the shop because I only get my hair done in the shop like once or twice a year. I have a 4c coiled hair type which is the most senstive and dry so this product does work if used correctly it just takes time and practice.</li>
    <li> The Price is not the greatest but I do love how this product gives me the results that I am looking for when I do spiral curls and it also makes my hair shiny. I personally love the smell of the product and don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
    <li> So far this product is the best I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent.  There is no residue on your hair and it gives your hair a nice sheen.</li>
    <li> I tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curly Pudding in the free samples via their website. I have 4A hair very tightly curled but a definite curl and it is a TWA. I normally use Kinky Curly curling custard in the mornings for a wash and go. I like kinky curly but my curls can get stiff. Not with Miss Jessie&#x27;s curly pudding. My curls were even more defined and still soft. I will definitely purchase the large container now. I recommend getting the free samples first. Save your money and see if it is for you.</li>
    <li> It works! Can be pricey, and the scent can be a little strong. Otherwise, it &amp;#34;tames&amp;#34; and controls your curls beautifully!</li>
    <li> It leaves your hair flaky. I didnt like that.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  My curls hold all day long.  It eliminates the frizz!</li>
    <li> The smell is incredible!!  I love this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 3c/4a and this did absolutely nothing, but leave a white flaky residue and create dandruff on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I tried it three seperate times/2 different washes (freshly washed/damp/dry) and all times I took down my braidout or twists to discover a flakey, frizzy mess. I usually never leave a bad review, but this product was way too expensive for (1) no curl defintion, (2) leaving product residue, and a (3)frizzy mess. I also used the same amount I use of any twisting butter (Camille Rose, Shea Moisture, or raw shea), and had completely different results with other products. I purchased mine at a Target (Broadview, IL), but according to most of the reviews, so far this just looks like some whipped butter with grape kool-aid flavoring and probably not a bad batch. No thanks, Miss Jessie!</li>
    <li> The only think wrong is there isn&#x27;t a shine to the hair.</li>
    <li> When I saw this product initially at a beauty supply, I saw it was geared more for dark afro type hair, my hair is very blonde and curly wavy, always looks a bit frizzy, this stuff is the bomb, second time I bought it now..........</li>
    <li> This product worked great!  My curls were well defined with no frizz and they were not stiff.  My hair was also nice and shiny.  I got lots of compliments on my curls.</li>
    <li> While I love the fruity smell, this is not the product for my hair. I&#x27;m a 4B, still early in my transition. It made my hair hard, frizzy, and dry with zero curl definition, and the shrinkage was ridiculous. It also seemed to make it tangle more. It&#x27;s hard to say I don&#x27;t recommend it because there are many different tpyes and textures of black hair, so what works for one doesn&#x27;t necessarily work for others, and many women I know love this stuff. All I can say is that it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I just love Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curly Pudding!!!  It&#x27;s the only thing that i have used that keeps my curls from frizzing.  I hate spending a lot of money on styling products but this is so worth the money.  I originally bought it at Target for $22 for an 8 oz jar.  Glad I checked on here before buying it again at Target as it is such a better deal on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who is complaining about this product making their hair dry, brittle, flakey......you are using way to much!! I have thick, curly shoulder length hair and I don&#x27;t use more then about a teaspoon amount on my hair.  I run it through my hair and let it air dry.</li>
    <li> Was opened and leaking product when i recieved it.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> It detangles the hair, leaving it soft and shiny. Hair is healthy. Thanks for the products, I&#x27;ve turned my friends on to it,&lt;br /&gt;everyone like the results of using this product</li>
