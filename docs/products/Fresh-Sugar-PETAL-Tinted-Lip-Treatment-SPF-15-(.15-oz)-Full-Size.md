### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best lip moisturizer ever.</li>
      <li>Best lip treatment I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>This is a wonderful color, too.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful product!  </li>
      <li>so it looks great on me.</li>
      <li>My lips are &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; and this is great.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
      <li>It lasts and feels and tastes good.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s closer to rose against my skin</li>
      <li>Greatly helped my very chapped lips as promised!  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I bought four of them when I found such a great price!</li>
      <li>Most brands of lipstick make my lips peel and flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying any more.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and the texture of it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff</li>
      <li>I had my doubts about this color, but it is more versatile than I thought.  </li>
      <li>I always love the smooth way this lovely lipstick glides on my mouth.  </li>
      <li>I love Fresh lip treatments and this color is light and cheerful</li>
      <li>I like to blot my lips after I smooth it on because it become almost transparent but the color remains, as does the soothing feel.  </li>
      <li>I own the Berry as well as the regular lip treatment.  </li>
      <li>What is left is quite nice</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite color.</li>
      <li>I bought the petal color because it&#x27;s basically a more vivid color of my natural lips</li>
      <li>Summers), so lost much of the product.</li>
      <li>Worked really well on my vacation in Hawaii.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Fresh Sugar is very nourishing.</li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s because the top of the case actually screws on and off, so those who are accustomed to just popping a lipstick open or closed could very easily break this one.</li>
      <li>It wipes completely off on the rim of a glass pretty much after one or two drinks.</li>
      <li>I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive because it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and in a large tube that will last a long time!</li>
      <li>Moisturizing, nice subtle color.  </li>
      <li>But did arrive very soft.  </li>
      <li>Love the simple add of just a little color.</li>
      <li>The scent is great and it doesn&#x27;t have that weird waxy taste like similar products.</li>
      <li>and it was soft when it arrived.</li>
      <li>I have gotten compliments on the classy case as well</li>
      <li>A subtle pink that is fairly sheer and just looks great.</li>
      <li>You have to be extremely careful with it as the tube twists on (I&#x27;ve twisted the stick up and smashed it on the top before), and it melts very very quickly.</li>
      <li>But now that I&#x27;m used to it, I prefer the screw top because it&#x27;s less likely to open accidentally in my bag.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t very long-lasting - maybe an hour as long you don&#x27;t drink anything.</li>
      <li>When ordering I thought Petal may be too brown, but it&#x27;s a very neutral pink that looks natural.</li>

    <li> I had my doubts about this color, but it is more versatile than I thought.  It looked like a bubble gum pink when I tried it out in a department store, but I think I just didn&#x27;t apply it generously enough.  It&#x27;s closer to rose against my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never tried a lip treatment that provided color and moisturizing as well as this product!</li>
    <li> I just got this today and it&#x27;s amazing! When ordering I thought Petal may be too brown, but it&#x27;s a very neutral pink that looks natural. The scent is great and it doesn&#x27;t have that weird waxy taste like similar products. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend ordering this in the summer as I ordered it in late April and it was soft when it arrived. So it would probably melt all the way in hotter temperatures.  Overall work the extra money vs other products!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Greatly helped my very chapped lips as promised!  But did arrive very soft.  Have to be ever so careful in applying it to keep it usable.  But it IS usable. Plan to buy another color.</li>
    <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive because it&#x27;s a great product.  Moisturizing, nice subtle color.  I&#x27;ve seen a number of reviews complaining that the tip breaks off. I think that&#x27;s because the top of the case actually screws on and off, so those who are accustomed to just popping a lipstick open or closed could very easily break this one. I&#x27;ve almost done it a few times myself.  But now that I&#x27;m used to it, I prefer the screw top because it&#x27;s less likely to open accidentally in my bag.</li>
    <li> I love Fresh lip treatments and this color is light and cheerful</li>
    <li> This arrived melted (Phx. Summers), so lost much of the product. What is left is quite nice and I use it.</li>
    <li> I think I have every color of the Sugar Lip Treatment but this is my favorite. A subtle pink that is fairly sheer and just looks great. This is probably my fourth tube of this color. Love it!</li>
    <li> Best lip treatment I&#x27;ve ever used.  Five stars!</li>
    <li> Most brands of lipstick make my lips peel and flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh Sugar is very nourishing. The color is buildable and yet sheer enough to not look too fussy.  I have gotten compliments on the classy case as well</li>
    <li> Best lip moisturizer ever.</li>
    <li> My lips are &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; and this is great.  I wear it often.  It lasts and feels and tastes good.  I own the Berry as well as the regular lip treatment.  Worked really well on my vacation in Hawaii.</li>
    <li> I always love the smooth way this lovely lipstick glides on my mouth.  This is a wonderful color, too.  I like to blot my lips after I smooth it on because it become almost transparent but the color remains, as does the soothing feel.  That&#x27;s why I bought four of them when I found such a great price!</li>
    <li> this is my second tube of this.  love it.</li>
    <li> does not chap my lips.</li>
    <li> Love the simple add of just a little color. It&#x27;s smooth and in a large tube that will last a long time! Love this stuff</li>
    <li> This Lip Treatment does not give my lips a lot of color.  And I&#x27;m not sure about the taste.  But I like the long-lasting quality and that the cap screws on to the base is a nice feature.</li>
    <li> I like the color, the feel and the screw case BUT the active ingredient is oxybenzone, a known hormone disruptor. This is not some &amp;#34;all chemicals are bad&amp;#34; comment, but rather &amp;#34;this is a known bad ingredient in sunscreens.&amp;#34; Do you really wanted it in your breast milk?</li>
    <li> I bought the petal color because it&#x27;s basically a more vivid color of my natural lips so it looks great on me. I also have cherry which is extremely red and one that&#x27;s sheer. This is by far my favorite color. I love the smell and the texture of it.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying any more. For one it&#x27;s expensive. You have to be extremely careful with it as the tube twists on (I&#x27;ve twisted the stick up and smashed it on the top before), and it melts very very quickly. It isn&#x27;t very long-lasting - maybe an hour as long you don&#x27;t drink anything. It wipes completely off on the rim of a glass pretty much after one or two drinks. And it makes my lips chapped if I wear it all day. I&#x27;ve had this problem with other lip balms before though, the only lip balm that helps rather than hurts me is Chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Color&lt;br /&gt;  Texture&lt;br /&gt;  Smell&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Price&lt;br /&gt;  Melts too easy&lt;br /&gt;  Not for long-lasting wear&lt;br /&gt;  Doesn&#x27;t soften or heal your lips like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
