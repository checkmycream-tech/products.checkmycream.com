      <li>The shampoo and conditioner have a wonderful light scent.  </li>
      <li>Its great for all hair types and is very cheap for how well it works.</li>
      <li>So if you have a silky healthy mane, this stuff&#x27;s great</li>
      <li>Also is great on skin :)   </li>
      <li>While the shampoo is nice, I didn&#x27;t find it to be exceptional, and it did nothing for my scalp.  </li>
      <li>And since using it, I must say, I LOVE it!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Emu oil shampoo, conditioner and oil for about 6 months now and I absolutely love them!  </li>
      <li>but this is for people who already have fabulous hair and great genes.</li>
      <li>LOVED BOTH ITEMS AND LOVE</li>
      <li>They are very prompt in shipping and polite and try their very best to please you.</li>
      <li>Loved the set and love the w&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It smells nice.  </li>
      <li>and she decided to try the set anyway as she liked the scent.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells so great, and I feel like my scalp is clean after using it.</li>
      <li>I really love the combinations.</li>
      <li>I wish it had more oil.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to LOVE this product as I adore Emu Oil</li>
      <li>They did send a free tube of lip gloss with emu oil with the set... a nice touch</li>
      <li>have scalp dryness and this set has helped my scalp to feel better.  </li>
      <li>After some more research I found this shampoo/condtioner combo</li>
      <li>well, maybe this works better for in-between hair...</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>All I know for sure is that this is not a product I will ever use again.</li>
      <li>if my hair was healthy there is no doubt in my mind</li>
      <li>Love it .I</li>
      <li>it smells pretty good.  </li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t really rave about these aside from the pleasant smell.  </li>
      <li>This is the best shampoo and conditioner if your hair is dry and brittle.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lot more runny than I expected, but that does not take away from the great product!</li>
      <li>Most shampoos makes your hair feel silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s also a great product to keep hair soft and sweet!</li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products!</li>
      <li>Love it as it leaves your hair and scalp feeling clean.</li>
      <li>However, the conditioner is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>Shipped fast and nicely packed.</li>
      <li>Emu oil is great for the hair and skin, this shampoo and Conditioner really helped my hair recover from a very damaged state.</li>
      <li>guess I&#x27;ll finish off this love fest with a high recommmendation and an A++++++ rating to the company and the product. :)</li>
      <li>I also find the scent off, it doesn&#x27;t have a clean smell almost like a musty/sour smell.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this product for dry scalp and am happy that I decided to try this product.  </li>
      <li>After more than two uses, it builds up and makes my hair kind of gross.  </li>
      <li>Lol, I mean it&#x27;s nice putting something on your head that isn&#x27;t infested with chemicals...</li>
      <li>A WHILE OF USE: After about a week or 2 of use I do have to suggest maybe trying out a good conditioner or deep condtioner to use once a week with this product.</li>
      <li>I also love that it has emu oil in it however, not that much.</li>
      <li>Other reviews seemed to say this was great, but not for me.</li>
      <li>Update May 2015: if you are also looking for a remedy to super itchy scalp with no dandruff or rash, try products without methylisothiazolinone.</li>
      <li>I received my order relatively quick (</li>
      <li>I received it fairly quickly and used it right away.</li>
      <li>Again, old stand-by, non-medicated, John Frieda hair care is better.  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that the shampoo has all natural ingredients and is Ph-balanced.  </li>
      <li>Maybe this shampoo and conditioner set simply isn&#x27;t right for ethnic hair.</li>
      <li>so I feel like I&#x27;m not washing my hair right.</li>
      <li>The shampoo suds very very well.</li>
      <li>Thanks Silky Garden!).  </li>
      <li>Really did not expect these products to work so well!</li>
      <li>I love this product and have purchased another set but the bigger bottles!</li>
      <li>, I instantly ordered more.</li>
      <li>Purchasing through Amazon was easy and secure and delivery was received well before the expected arrival date.  </li>
      <li>However, this product contains more coconut oil than emu oil and itwas a great disappointment.</li>
      <li>After washing my hair with the shampoo my hair feels clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>a little goes a long works beautifully in my hair which is full but straight.</li>
      <li>Because I&#x27;ve been begining to notice my hair feeling just a litttleee bit dry :)</li>
      <li>it dry :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not to mention the fact that this product really is all natural (which is rare to find these days)</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair</li>
      <li>They really put a lot of time and care into creating and shipping these products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve saved the shampoo to use as a body wash, but haven&#x27;t really tried it out for that yet.  </li>
      <li>Evidently many people are allergic to this ingredient in lotions and hair products and it isn&#x27;t widely known.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t tell what is happening</li>
      <li>She goes through it so fast though.</li>
      <li>A gentle tingle?</li>
      <li>and it cleaned my hair so gently</li>
      <li>I have a super itchy scalp this summer for no reason (not dry, no rash, nothing).</li>
      <li>I wash my hair, the shampoo really makes it feel rough instead of very sleek and smooth.</li>
      <li>I occasionally have an allergic reaction to deodorant and this is the only thing that makes the skin feel better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m black and this makes my hair very soft and lovely...</li>
      <li>Turns out I have a scalp yeast infection, and since normal dandruff shampoos didn&#x27;t help he prescribed me a shampoo and lotion.</li>
      <li>This shampoo &amp; conditoner set is DEFINITLY worth the extra money to add to your morning or night routine.</li>
      <li>Many actually thought i had straighten my hair on purpose even when I allowed it to air dry.</li>
      <li>I went to the doctors a few days ago after trying everything that I&#x27;ve read to be good for a dry itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>Now I can run my hands through soft hair!</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>&quot; in a product and although as a black woman oil is important to my hair, I don&#x27;t want the oily look or feel.  </li>
      <li>smells good, but it&#x27;s too watery for my long thick hair-the search continues...</li>
      <li>when I flat iron my hair afterwards it turns out soo straight and flowy!</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t watch to wash your hair with a bunch of chemicals and are looking for soft hair..</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much easier it was to straighten my hair the next morning after showering with this</li>
      <li>I was looking for a natural based producat that would not be hardsh and wouldn&#x27;t strip my natural 4A/3C hair.</li>
      <li>Wow, saw this product in a magazine for 3x the price with Silky&#x27;s Garden on Amazon.</li>
      <li>i was surprised that it also was a body wash on its label.</li>
      <li>Afterwards, my hair is soft and feels well conditioned.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of \\&quot;slip\\&quot; for detangling but it is enough.  </li>
      <li>Needless to say, I was delighted.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this product!!!! The shampoo can also be used as a body wash and it has done wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t watch to wash your hair with a bunch of chemicals and are looking for soft hair.. this is it.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t tell what is happening here.when I wash my hair, the shampoo really makes it feel rough instead of very sleek and smooth.Most shampoos makes your hair feel silky and smooth. i was surprised that it also was a body wash on its label. I can&#x27;t see shampoo and body wash linked together. I have to wait and see the results over time.</li>
    <li> smells good, but it&#x27;s too watery for my long thick hair-the search continues...</li>
    <li> Emu oil is great for the hair and skin, this shampoo and Conditioner really helped my hair recover from a very damaged state. Its great for all hair types and is very cheap for how well it works.</li>
    <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;I have scalp dryness and this set has helped my scalp to feel better.  I will continue to use as long as it is carried by AMAZON.  Goldie</li>
    <li> Sometimes my hair would feel a little like straw just like it had been stripped after a shampooing.. but the conditioner wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> This shampoo &amp; conditoner set is DEFINITLY worth the extra money to add to your morning or night routine. I have medium length, wavy hair that&#x27;s about average in thickness.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunetly out of the blue I recently started struggling with slightly dry,itchy scalp (though without dandruff) and have spent quite a bit of money going through different shampoos/conditoners found in supermarkets. Tea Tree oil, Herbal Essences, L&#x27;oreal, Aveeno and even salon grade products didn&#x27;t make any difference when it came to my dry, itchy scalp..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So finally I decided to sit down at my computer to do some further research besides just online reviews on beauty sites. And that&#x27;s when I discoverd about emu oil (if you do some research on it, it seems like a miracle product). After some more research I found this shampoo/condtioner combo and I will always use it from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this set completely get rid of my dry/itchy scalp but it also makes hair extremly soft,clean and managable. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much easier it was to straighten my hair the next morning after showering with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the fact that this product really is all natural (which is rare to find these days) so I always feel like I&#x27;m treating my hair and body well when I use this shampoo/condioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as the cherry on the cake is the company that sells this product. They are very prompt in shipping and polite and try their very best to please you. They really put a lot of time and care into creating and shipping these products. Just check out their website and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.. I hope they never stop producing this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll finish off this love fest with a high recommmendation and an A++++++ rating to the company and the product. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTER A WHILE OF USE: After about a week or 2 of use I do have to suggest maybe trying out a good conditioner or deep condtioner to use once a week with this product. Because I&#x27;ve been begining to notice my hair feeling just a litttleee bit dry :)it dry :)</li>
    <li> Lol, I mean it&#x27;s nice putting something on your head that isn&#x27;t infested with chemicals... but this is for people who already have fabulous hair and great genes. If you have damaged hair or you&#x27;re seeking moisture, don&#x27;t use this. BUT, do get the EMU Oil, that stuff works wonders on dry hair and you only need a tiny tiny drop. Also is great on skin :)   So if you have a silky healthy mane, this stuff&#x27;s great :) But I have thin, moisture starved hair, so I need a little more.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with pure emu oil for a really dry itchy scalp issue I&#x27;ve had for over a year. It actually didn&#x27;t help my scalp. But the texture of my hair has definitely improved. My hair is noticeably softer. I went to the doctors a few days ago after trying everything that I&#x27;ve read to be good for a dry itchy scalp. Turns out I have a scalp yeast infection, and since normal dandruff shampoos didn&#x27;t help he prescribed me a shampoo and lotion. So although this didn&#x27;t help with my intended issue, it still seems to be good stuff.</li>
    <li> I wanted to LOVE this product as I adore Emu Oil and it has done wonders to improve my dry, breaking hair. However, this product contains more coconut oil than emu oil and itwas a great disappointment. I received it fairly quickly and used it right away. After shampooing, it left my hair like wet straw. I figured this would go away after I used the conditioner-wrong! After the conditioner, my hair was even worse! I let it dry naturally and I was horrified when it started breaking off as I napped. There was a LOT of hair all over my pillow! I was shocked as I did not expect such a thing from a product that claimed to be natural. I immediately returned to my old shampoo and conditioner from LUSH and was relieved when no more breaking incurred. Maybe this shampoo and conditioner set simply isn&#x27;t right for ethnic hair. I also find it a bit misleading that it actually contains very little Emu Oil. I told my friend about the experience and she decided to try the set anyway as she liked the scent. She suffered no hair loss but it left her fine, (usually silky) hair looking like the end of a broom. Yikes! I have curly, thick, shoulder-length hair and well, maybe this works better for in-between hair...I don&#x27;t know. All I know for sure is that this is not a product I will ever use again. It was not worth the price, time, or use to me. So, if you&#x27;re thinking of buying this, I recommend you first take a real, long look at the ingredients list. Before using it, add a little olive oil to your hair and keep it on for thirty minutes before you go in for the wash. This might protect your hair a bit if you&#x27;re not sure about the results you will receive.</li>
    <li> well first of all i have naturally curty hair, i got the emu oil shampoo because i went blonde and it KILLED my hair. Emu oil (from what i have been told) can heal any and everything. i used it a few times and i think my hair is just too damaged to even let the shampoo and conditioner do its job. Then again any shampoo i use will dry out my hair so fast. if my hair was healthy there is no doubt in my mind this product would do awesomely for my hair.</li>
    <li> Ordered Emu Oil Shampoo and Conditioner set for my wife.  She loves it!  It makes her hair look great.</li>
    <li> It smells nice.  But I can&#x27;t really rave about these aside from the pleasant smell.  After more than two uses, it builds up and makes my hair kind of gross.  I tried just, &amp;#34;sticking it out,&amp;#34; and used it for a couple weeks before going back to my old stand-by brand.  Emu oil is also supposed to help skin issues like psoriasis, nope.  Made it worse.  Again, old stand-by, non-medicated, John Frieda hair care is better.  I&#x27;ve even tried this stuff in well water and in city water.  No go.&lt;br /&gt;I DO, however, like using the shampoo as a bodywash/conditioner:  It makes my skin feel pretty soft and helps sooth irritated dry skin.  I occasionally have an allergic reaction to deodorant and this is the only thing that makes the skin feel better.</li>
    <li> Loved the set and love the w&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVED BOTH ITEMS AND LOVE THE WAY IT LEAVES MY HAIR TO STYLE</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m black and this makes my hair very soft and lovely...when I flat iron my hair afterwards it turns out soo straight and flowy! Love it .I also recommend usin emu oil the night before u wash ur hair. That&#x27;s also a great product to keep hair soft and sweet!</li>
    <li> Purchased this when I first went natural little over a year ago, but rarely used since I became such a product junkie,lol! Well I went back to this last week and it cleaned my hair so gently, I instantly ordered more. I believe it&#x27;s the distilled water that&#x27;s in it. Don&#x27;t sleep on this ladies, give it a try. Curls were popping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Emu oil shampoo, conditioner and oil for about 6 months now and I absolutely love them!  I was a little hesitant initially about the term \\&quot;oil\\&quot; in a product and although as a black woman oil is important to my hair, I don&#x27;t want the oily look or feel.  These products were beyond my expectations!  Before using these products I would have to relax my hair at least every 6-8 weeks.  Now I will probably go back to natural because these products make my hair very soft and managable without a greasy feel or appearance.  The emu oil absorbs completely with no residue left on pillows, furniture or anywhere else.  A little goes a long way so about 3 drops applied to my medium length hair lasts at least 3-4 days.  Living in a desert atmosphere makes it difficult to keep my hair from drying out but these products have totally changed that. The shampoo and conditioner have a wonderful light scent.  Don&#x27;t expect lather like other shampoo&#x27;s because this product truly has ALL natural ingredients so there&#x27;s very little sudsing if at all which is not something I miss.  I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that the shampoo has all natural ingredients and is Ph-balanced.  I also love that it has emu oil in it however, not that much. I wish it had more oil.  It is not as oily as another reviewer may have said.  All-in-all it smells pretty good.  I also thought it might cure me of my extremely itchy, dry scalp, but it didn&#x27;t.  I wish I could find something that would cure that.</li>
    <li> While the shampoo is nice, I didn&#x27;t find it to be exceptional, and it did nothing for my scalp.  However, the conditioner is fabulous.  A very small amount produces very soft feeling hair, and with my extra thick hair, that&#x27;s saying something.  The bottle lasted four months, since so little was needed (I wash my hair 2-3 times a week). I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Really did not expect these products to work so well! I have fine, thin, damaged hair, but right after the first shampoo/conditioning my hair felt silkier, had less &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; feeling ends, was shinier, and had some bounce. Needless to say, I was delighted. I have bought again with the same results.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner if your hair is dry and brittle.  I used these once and my hair felt like silk.  Only downside is that my hair tends to feel oily with continued use.  I have to switch between this and another quality shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Amazon on a whim.  I was looking for a natural based producat that would not be hardsh and wouldn&#x27;t strip my natural 4A/3C hair. I have been using it for about 4 weeks (4-5 washes).  I received my order relatively quick (Thanks Silky Garden!).  And since using it, I must say, I LOVE it!  The shampoo suds very very well. If you do not rinse/wet your hair well of the products and oils you already have in your hair, there will be little to no sudsing (Hair Tip:  Saturate your hair with water only then wash with Emu Shampoo, OR saturate with water,wash with any ole shampoo, rinse, then wash with this shampoo.  Both ways worked for me). After washing my hair with the shampoo my hair feels clean and soft.  The conditioner doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of \\&quot;slip\\&quot; for detangling but it is enough.  Instructions say to leave the conditioner on for 1-2 minutes but I like to leave it on for a little longer (15-20mins) and cover my hair with a plastic cap/bag and then rinse. Afterwards, my hair is soft and feels well conditioned.  I follow with JBCO which is an added bonus for moisturizing. I will definitely continue using this shampoo and conditioner.  I love this product and have purchased another set but the bigger bottles!</li>
    <li> Wow, saw this product in a magazine for 3x the price with Silky&#x27;s Garden on Amazon. I&#x27;d never used Emu Oil before so I decided to try with this company - and wow! This stuff smells so great, and I feel like my scalp is clean after using it. A gentle tingle? Maybe that&#x27;s my imagination...either way, it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s a lot more runny than I expected, but that does not take away from the great product!</li>
    <li> I find that for the cost this system is not worth it. I have to use quite a bit of conditioner to cover my hair, the shampoo I find is hard to work through my hair. I have very curly hair so mayve that makes a differance. I also find the scent off, it doesn&#x27;t have a clean smell almost like a musty/sour smell.</li>
    <li> Love it as it leaves your hair and scalp feeling clean.</li>
    <li> Great organic product will buy both again</li>
    <li> a little goes a long works beautifully in my hair which is full but straight. Will definitely buy over  and over again. Shipped fast and nicely packed.</li>
    <li> Meh.  I have a super itchy scalp this summer for no reason (not dry, no rash, nothing). I&#x27;ve tried lots of products and read about this stuff. It seemed to leave my hair rather rough and dry, and did no good for my scalp itchiness.  I&#x27;ve saved the shampoo to use as a body wash, but haven&#x27;t really tried it out for that yet.  Other reviews seemed to say this was great, but not for me. They did send a free tube of lip gloss with emu oil with the set... a nice touch and I do like the gloss! Update May 2015: if you are also looking for a remedy to super itchy scalp with no dandruff or rash, try products without methylisothiazolinone. (This product does not have it if I remember correctly, but I still didn&#x27;t care for it).   Evidently many people are allergic to this ingredient in lotions and hair products and it isn&#x27;t widely known.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner solved my dry scalp problem and made my hair less dry and brittle. Now I can run my hands through soft hair!</li>
    <li> My hair was very dry and my scalp oily from the winter air, this has really helped and it makes my hair so soft and my scalp is clearer now.</li>
    <li> I have to say after using this combination after a day, my hair was soft and straight, less frizzy. Many actually thought i had straighten my hair on purpose even when I allowed it to air dry. I really love the combinations.</li>
    <li> She goes through it so fast though. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive but I&#x27;ve been instructed to keep a supply on hand by the boss. I&#x27;ll do as I&#x27;m told!</li>
    <li> I have dry scalp and the shampoo and conditioner seems to help my problem.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that there are hardly any bubbles from the shampoo so I feel like I&#x27;m not washing my hair right.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product for dry scalp and am happy that I decided to try this product.  It works great and keeps my scalp moisturized and feeling great. I would definitely purchase this product over and over again.  Purchasing through Amazon was easy and secure and delivery was received well before the expected arrival date.  The package was delivered undamaged and packaged well.  Great product!</li>
