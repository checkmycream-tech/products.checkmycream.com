    <li> what can you say? This is the BEST product to use hands down if you want that stencil to stay put!!!</li>
    <li> Two wipes and its gone...after it dried over an hour. Tried it multiple times, many different ways...could have just melted a speed stick, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> This stuff is worth its weight in gold!! I have had to let stay on for 20 minutes despite what the label says.. But that 20 mins is worth the wait, trust me!! It holds the stencil on with the strength of 100 men, does not wipe away!!! will definitely be ordering more !!!</li>
