      <li>Don&#x27;t know the foundation of these chemicals that make up this product, but I love it and how it makes my skin look so perfected for a grandmother of 65.  </li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t bother trying anything else any more.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin look nice and smooth and makeup is often not needed.</li>
      <li>must admit that I don&#x27;t see the miraculous results that others have posted, but I do see that my face seems to be more moisturized and</li>
      <li>, I was sent the regular Protect &amp;Perfect Serum</li>
      <li>Love Boots</li>
      <li>Good results and price was right.  </li>
      <li>well, i did some research and found that boots had great reviews, but i asked my older sister (28)</li>
      <li>Merry Christmas to all and a Happy New Year</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t give it a perfect 5 stars because I was initially looking for something paraben free, and this turned out not to be.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my skin felling soft and people noticed how great my skin looks.</li>
      <li>So far it is great.....</li>
      <li>I put this right where it came from, the trash!!</li>

      <li>I received both of my bottles very quickly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a  nice cream at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s true.. a miracle in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;lines diminished just like magic.</li>
      <li>This No. 7 has been known to help treat fine lines and skin texture.  </li>
      <li>I really love the Boots No7 Protect &amp; Perfect Serum but do not love it&#x27;s cost.  </li>
      <li>did not notice a visible improvement in wrinkles or fine lines, but my skin does look radiant.  </li>
      <li>hope im that lucky!)</li>
      <li>This is a great product to use if you want to see improvements in the overall appearance of your skin, and it helps to diminish fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>I agree with the cosmetics review boards who find the Boot&#x27;s No7 line to be one of most effective, yet modestly priced anti-aging creams.</li>
      <li>Fantastic skin cream.  </li>
      <li>and SHE said that she uses boots too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well, after hesitating about 3 minutes (1oz didnt sound like a lot)</li>

      <li>Although there is GREAT improvement in the shine and wrinkles in my skin, I think it is more due to the Retin-A.</li>

      <li>and i cant wait to see how amazing my skin will look as i get older.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of anti-aging products and this stuff is the best,yet!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m halfway through my first tube and I believe I saw results the first week. I&#x27;m 52 and tried everything under the sun. I have other tried and true products but this is definately a permanent addition to my regime. My skin appears firmer, more radiant, and even the deep wrinkles on my forehead are much less noticable. And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes my skin feel.  I have coupled it with the #7 Night Cream.  I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Came quickly.  Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> This is a nice light daytime or evening lotion. Doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes (wear contacts) or sting my skin. Have been using this for a few years and it does make my skin look smoother.</li>
    <li> This one of the very best skin serums I have used....</li>
    <li> This is my main beauty ingredient, next to sunblock.  I love it.  Any Boots No 7 product is a great product.</li>
    <li> Heals any imperfection on my face!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 65 years old and have been looking for something to lessen the lines around my mouth....this serum has done it!!  I love it and would recommend to anyone.  Never thought I&#x27;d actually find something that would work....and have only been using it for two months...amazing. I use the moisturizers too and will be ordering the eye cream next.</li>
    <li> This No. 7 has been known to help treat fine lines and skin texture.  It wears well under makeup and with other B and B creams</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month but only in the mornings.  My skin feels firmer and my pores are smaller.  I really like this product! It works for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really loving this.  I had read a review in a news story and ordered it to try it.  I could feel a difference in my skin the first day.  It took a little longer to see the difference but I love the way my skin looks and feels.  I usually have mild dryness which can make your foundation look bad.  I use this every day before I put on my make up and also at night after I take off my makeup and my skin is soft and no dryness anymore.</li>
    <li> In brief, the Boot&#x27;s No. 7 beauty products are the best I&#x27;ve ever found. The No. 7 Protect and Perfect Intense Serum will convince you.</li>
    <li> i turned 26 and thought i should do something to prevent wrinkles.  well, i did some research and found that boots had great reviews, but i asked my older sister (28) what she used. she mentioned that she&#x27;d been using Boots, this brand from the UK...enjoyed it...blah blah blah. wow - coincidence! then i asked my mom (58), who is EXTREMELY low maintenance, started using face cremes only a few years ago (looks great anyways - hope im that lucky!), and SHE said that she uses boots too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well, after hesitating about 3 minutes (1oz didnt sound like a lot), i ordered it and im SO glad! the 1oz lasts me quite a long time (about 4 months?). ive been using this for about 1-2 years, and i concurrently bought  dermadoctor wrinkle revenge, clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel, and aveda radience fluid.  i would give up the dermadoctor and the aveda, and keep this product (boots) and the clinique moisturizing gel.  i feel as if boots WOULD moisturize my face just fine, but since its pretty expensive for such a small amount, i think i tend to use less than i should.  so i use the clinique in the evenings and bootsin the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i HIGHLY recommend this for brightening, tightening, and maintaining your skin texture/tone, along with a favorite moisturizer (for both younger and more mature ladies)!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 3 days now and I must say people are thinking that I am much younger. I am unsure if I can give credit to this product, but prior to using this product, I didn&#x27;t feel that I look so young.  I would recommend everyone try.</li>
    <li> I bought the product from the hype on TV and in the magazines.  Although there is GREAT improvement in the shine and wrinkles in my skin, I think it is more due to the Retin-A.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement, but my skin has not gotten any worse either for being 59 years of age.</li>
    <li> I am not noticing any difference from any other product I have used in the past.  Basically not worth trying.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too soon to see if it works or not.</li>
    <li> This does a great job on wrinkles without being greasy or heavy on the skin.  Would recommend after a retinol product.</li>
    <li> The wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> reduced pores and skin feels rejuvinated</li>
    <li> so far love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> Did not impress me at all. Did not do what it claimed. Put on every day. No difference. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> did everything according to the instructions and it did nothing. i have had absolutely no difference to my skin.</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin look nice after use. But I haven&#x27;t noticed any permanent difference.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that I have notice any difference in my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I know at my age it will not make my wrinkles just disappear, but it seems to soften them up and make them less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a long time&lt;br /&gt;I loved it&lt;br /&gt;But my skin began plateauing&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t looking any better, and actually began looking more damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it was great for the time I used it, I have now switched to bio oil, and would not go back!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It has helped to reduce the wrinkles on my face and neck and makes my face feel good.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.</li>
    <li> Good results and price was right.  Also recommended by a dermatologist ; would recommend to my friends and family also.,</li>
    <li> Love this, I get this over Mary Kay products. And my dermatologist said that my skin looks so much better and since the last visit and that&#x27;s been since I started using this. The price is great too!</li>
    <li> Great product with very favorable reviews from Good Housekeeping ! Will keep using.</li>
    <li> Great for my face.  Love number seven.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. It makes me look younger. Love love love love love it.&lt;br /&gt;Best cream ever. Lasts for 6 months</li>
    <li> i LOVE this serum. i have gotten so many complements since i have been using this. everyone has been asking why i look so good lately. this stuff is my little secrete. my skin feels so soft and amazing. im only 26 and i cant wait to see how amazing my skin will look as i get older. a customer for life. i also have very sensitive skin and this does not bother my skin what so ever. honestly you need to buy this and try it for yourself. it is just amazing!!!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know the foundation of these chemicals that make up this product, but I love it and how it makes my skin look so perfected for a grandmother of 65.  Will try other No. 7 items down the road, for sure.</li>
    <li> I like it. Don&#x27;t know if it takes my wrinkles away, but feels good going on and absorbs nicely. I use it with other products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Protect and Perfect for about 3 years now and everything was fine. It did seem to be keeping fine lines at bay and preventing the fine ones from getting deeper (not a spring chicken here!). However, they changed the formula in early 2014 and I have to give it up as its given me loads and loads and LOADS of whiteheads! Most embarrassing at my age!    I suspected that it was the new formula, but didn&#x27;t want to give it up. However, after wandering into another skin shop one day, I was given a months supply of their product and so I stopped using the Protect and Perfect at the end of the tube. The endless march of whiteheads stopped appearing within 3 days. I used the other product for a month and had nothing other than the odd period-related period. Then, when I ran out of the other product, I cracked open a new tube of Protect and Perfect and it didn&#x27;t even take 2 days before the whiteheads began manifesting and advancing across my face. Now, 4 days into it and I have no less than 10 pimples on my face.    It looks like I&#x27;m going to go back to the other product - although I&#x27;m not sure it is as effective on the skin as Protect and Perfect. But I am NOT fond of having zillions of pimples every day! Call it an allergic reaction. I didn&#x27;t have this issue with the old formula, but I definitely do with the new one.</li>
    <li> I apply this to my freshly cleaned face prior to any moisture cream.  It is wonderful.  Has really helped with dry skin and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> My wife love this product.</li>
    <li> Feels nice. I have not noticed any difference. Have been using about 2 months.</li>
    <li> Used for 40 days did not see a change</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the hype is about this product. But once again, I fall for it thinking it&#x27;s going to do everything they claim. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and I see nothing great. How it  got the Good Housekeeping seal is beyond me. I always valued that rating...but now I&#x27;m suspect. It&#x27;s a  nice cream at a very reasonable price. But that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Wow, this serum leaves your skin so soft, it&#x27;s amazing.  I was really pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit that I don&#x27;t see the miraculous results that others have posted, but I do see that my face seems to be more moisturized and luminous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one has commented on my skin.  But like I said, this serum leaves your skin very silky smooth and soft -- and that&#x27;s got to be a good thing, right?</li>
    <li> One of their best products.</li>
    <li> I can tell a significant difference after 2 weeks - will buy again</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
    <li> Only been using this product for 3 weeks. Like it so far but true test will come after 3 months of usage . So far so good</li>
    <li> Love this! Skin looks great after two weeks.</li>
    <li> So far, not a bit of change. I don&#x27;t understand how it shows the seal of approval when that is given to a product that does what it claims to.  Has been 5 weeks and no change at all.  Going to continue to use and keep my hopes up but seriously would not recommend to anyone.  Seems like a complete waste of money at this point.</li>
    <li> This is my second time using this product.  Yes, I like it.  However, I haven&#x27;t used it for a long period of time, but so far it is the better serum that I have used.</li>
    <li> Super product. Not oily but very moisturizing. I buy about 1 tube every 2 months and try not to ever run out.  (Don&#x27;t get the pump version -- you&#x27;ll lose a lot a the bottom.  With the tube, you can cut the top off to get out the last remaining bits).</li>
    <li> Ladies:  I NEVER believe in miracle creams, but Boot&#x27;s No7 REALLY works!!!  I saw a substantial difference in glow and a much softer texture and all-around appearance in less than 3 weeks!  I received both of my bottles very quickly.  This 50-year old lady, highly recommends this product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gone now and I didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> One of the best serums I&#x27;ve tried.  Leaves my skin felling soft and people noticed how great my skin looks.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live with out it</li>
    <li> Really like this product.</li>
    <li> I have very fine lines only on my forehead and I have been using this product for a month now and don&#x27;t see any changes or improvements at all. I will continue using product until it&#x27;s all gone, if nothing improves I won&#x27;t buy again especially since it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
    <li> So far it is great..... I need a little more time to truly judge the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She says it works as expected.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing . I recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have not been using it for very long - about two weeks.  I don&#x27;t see much difference as yet.  I expect with more time, there may be more difference. It is a small tube.  I doubt that it will last longer than one month so keep in mind when buying.</li>
    <li> I did not notice any difference than other&#x27;s . Not Perfect or intense!</li>
    <li> This worked wonders on the lines I was beginning to develop above my upper lip. They started to disappear after just two weeks. I agree with the cosmetics review boards who find the Boot&#x27;s No7 line to be one of most effective, yet modestly priced anti-aging creams.</li>
    <li> This is a good value.  I&#x27;ve tried more and less expensive moisturizers.  I won&#x27;t bother trying anything else any more.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell if I really notice, however friends say lines by mouth are much less visible. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum.  I don&#x27;t give it a perfect 5 stars because I was initially looking for something paraben free, and this turned out not to be.  My pores look much smaller and my skin feels very soft and looks like it has a nice glow.  My husband actually commented on how nice my skin looked yesterday, I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s ever commented on it before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice a visible improvement in wrinkles or fine lines, but my skin does look radiant.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll stick with this long term, because I am looking for something more naturally derived, but I&#x27;m fairly happy with the results.</li>
    <li> The tube of product was quite small, so I have not been lathering my face with it.  I&#x27;m using conservatively and have not noticed any marked improvement.  No one seems to have noticed a change in my skin.  Not sure it&#x27;s worth the money or the hype, but will continue using it until I have exhausted my supply and then see what I think.</li>
    <li> I am 40 years old with oily/combination skin and I have very few wrinkles to speak of, which is surprising since I am a former smoker.  I started a skin care regimen in my early 20s, so I&#x27;m assuming that helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product after seeing a news report about it on a major news network in 2007.  Apparently, this was a hot commodity over in the UK, so I had to get my hands on it.  This is a great product to use if you want to see improvements in the overall appearance of your skin, and it helps to diminish fine lines and wrinkles.  I also use this in conjunction with several other products, including, but not limited to, microdermabrasion products, retinol, vitamin C, SPF lotion, and night creams.</li>
    <li> I can not see any change on my skin</li>
    <li> Love this serum, It feels so good on my skin. Love Boots No 7 products. I get a lot of complements.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed any significant differences in skin texture.  It does have a nice, silky feel to it and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. I love it.</li>
    <li> Best serum I have found and is just as good as more expensive department store brands! I will stick to this product line.</li>
    <li> I liked the way my skin felt, but it dried out my skin and made it peel. I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; to be any different than any of the many products being marketed these days.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again because of the price.</li>
    <li> Fantastic skin cream.  Soaks right into the skin.  Leaves the face feeling  baby soft!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen sun in a while on east coast so don&#x27;t know how this product will work as a sun screen.  For everyday use, I see no advantage.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it says and more. I have very sensitive skin but this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. It works it&#x27;s magic all day under my makeup all day long. I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> AFTER ONLY 5DAYS USAGE OF THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;A COUPLE OF MY FRIENDS HAVE MADE POSITIVE&lt;br /&gt;COMMENTS ABOUT MY MORE VIBRANT SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;I TOO HAVE NOTICED VERY POSITIVE CHANGES.&lt;br /&gt;IT CERTAINLY HAS UPPED MY SELF CONFIDENCE&lt;br /&gt;IN MY APPEARANCE, IN AN UNBELIEVABLY SHORT&lt;br /&gt;TIME.</li>
    <li> Feel really light weight and great for my skin. Makes me feel refreshed and skin looks great and no signs of stress from my all nighters.</li>
    <li> Judging these products is difficult but I think it has improved my skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this out to see if it made any real difference. It&#x27;s a nice serum and I think it&#x27;s a good quality. But truly there is no magic here. Perhaps I need to try the entire No. 7 skin product line before judging ...</li>
    <li> Who thinks Good Housekeeping would certify product full of petrochemicals? The main ingredient is a silicone derivative that is on a FDA warning list as being a possible carcinogen to humans and went down the line in a litany of petro-whatevers. UGH!!! No wonder these are so cheap!!!! Shame on you, Boots. I put this right where it came from, the trash!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is one of few that doesn&#x27;t cause problems with my skin.  It makes my skin look nice and smooth and makeup is often not needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Boot&#x27;s No7 Protect &amp; Perfect Intense Serum THREE times...once for me, the second was for my husband (yes, he loved it too) and another for me! I&#x27;ll buy this wonderful cream until they no longer sell it! I highly recommend it! My husband and I are in our 60&#x27;s so we need all the help &amp;#34;Boot&#x27;s&amp;#34; can give us!</li>
    <li> great stuff, feels great on my skin. saw it on tv and decided to try it, glad I did excellent</li>
    <li> This product is ok, nothing to wrote home about.  I use No 7 in other products and found this one not to be that great, but what works for one person may not work for another.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in the intense, &amp; I did not get the intense, I was sent the regular Protect &amp;Perfect Serum</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for a few now and I notice a slight change in my skin for the better.  I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  This is the first and only serum that doesn&#x27;t do that ad my skin is very sensitive.</li>
    <li> It seems to be helping my wrinkly sun damaged face. My age spots are much lighter, and it feels so soft on my face.  !!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Made me break out and sat on TOP of my skin instead of absorbing into it.&lt;br /&gt;I have super sensitive and combo skin... Oh well...</li>
    <li> Makes a real difference in your skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
    <li> I love this and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this lotion for sometime now.  It is well worth the money and I can recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> I really love the Boots No7 Protect &amp; Perfect Serum but do not love it&#x27;s cost.  I do not mind paying for a good product, but this tube does not last, a little does not go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I believe the serum really does work and I absolutely love the silky texture when I apply it to my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;If there were more applications in the tube, I would give Boots No7 Protect &amp; Perfect Serum 5 stars, and more if I could!</li>
    <li> Not especially moisturizing, but helps make up to go on smoothly.</li>
    <li> I love their entire line, rich and serious softness. I use it before applying Clinique liquid makeup. Prepares skin to easily flow liquid makeup n softens skin</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s true.. a miracle in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;lines diminished just like magic. first application results.&lt;br /&gt;soft and smooth application with no irritation/used daily.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m over my mid 40&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;you can&#x27;t beat the low price for this super serum. also avail at boots dot com or target.&lt;br /&gt;i use the micro-dermabrasion exfoliator 2 times a week and then apply this serum&lt;br /&gt;and i love them.  i have purchased literally thousands of dollars of expensive beauty&lt;br /&gt;serums, lotions, creams ....etc etc...give this one a try.</li>
    <li> Great product I would recommend it to anyone! I really enjoyed what I received. Merry Christmas to all and a Happy New Year</li>
    <li> Give it about three weeks and you will start noticing a difference.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find anything special about this product.  It is not a moisturizer.  I put this on just after cleaning my face but before any moisturizer.  I found it was very drying!!  I couldn&#x27;t wait to use my regular moisturizer. It lasted about 6 weeks using it once a day. I really cannot see any benefit.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - it works!!</li>
    <li> I love all the Boot&#x27;s No&amp; products. They work!</li>
