    <li> seems to work....will take more time</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it corrects skin pigmentation problems with botanical extracts, so no harsh chemicals on my sensitive skin. But at the same time, you have to be patient. I&#x27;m Caucasian with really fair and sensitive skin. I had quite a bit sun spots on my face from last summer and after applying this religiously every day, they started to fade; I also used it on a scar from a mosquito bite on my hand, now it&#x27;s completely gone!</li>
    <li> I think I see a very little bit of improvement on a spot on my hand. Been using it twice daily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product almost a month now. It has lightened all of my acne scars as well as cleared up my skin. I will definitely keep buying it. It&#x27;s worth the price too. My skin has never felt this good.</li>
    <li> Bought this product and still no results&lt;br /&gt;Big waste of my money, sorry I even waste my time and hard earn money</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me ......i stopped  using  it because&lt;br /&gt;I could not see  or  read  the ingredients. I got&lt;br /&gt;rid of the remainder.</li>
    <li> This product works very good for my son skin with pigment allergy problems.The skin on his face started looks great!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, it really really does work!!</li>
    <li> Very bad product it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> works good some of my moles just fell off</li>
    <li> This product cost to much I through was big jar but it so small jar I don&#x27;t know it work or not if work good that ok for the right. thank you</li>
    <li> I really like this cream.. It has cleared my skin very quickly it Is Amazing!  I will continue using it until my entire face is clear.</li>
    <li> My face was breaking out badly, and as an adult, my skin is not as easy to clear up as it once was. The breakout left dark marks so I bought a clay mask, and this lotion, and hoped for the best. The lotion worked great and a little went a long way. It evened out my skin tone! Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used about half of the container and I was expecting my dark spots to be considerably lighter but they are not.</li>
    <li> I have the type of medium/fairskin that is supposed to be ideal for spot removers. I used it according to directions twice a day. Nothing. waste of money</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it worked as I have a lot of moles on back and neck and am self conscious</li>
    <li> ARE there any effective dark spot removers out there?! At any rate, this isn&#x27;t one of them. I used the full jar on the backs of my hands, giving it a couple of months to work and saw zero improvement.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work on me the spots are still there</li>
    <li> I received it a week ago,so is to early to talk about results.but  the hand spot started getting lighter, is leaving the skin soft and no smell at all.</li>
