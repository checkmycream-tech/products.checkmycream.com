<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My mom purchased this at Sally&#x27;s. it was really cheap, but it just didnt work for my hair. It made my hair feel a little hard and it didnt feel like it moisturized at all. Im relaxed with 4a/4b hair, i tried it on my natural new growth and it didnt work either. But a lot of people love it. But its just not for me :(</li>
    <li> great product great price</li>
    <li> Unfortunately did not work well for me, but everyone&#x27;s hair is different, you have to see what works for you. It means you become a product junkie at the beginning but eventually you find what you need.</li>
    <li> I am black and have all natural hair. It is not processed with anything like perm or relaxer. I do not color it either. My hair is naturally curly and long so now that I am older I wanted to find something that kept my natural curl, since grease breaks out my skin.   This is the first moisturizer that I have used in YEARS that actually works! My hair has never felt softer and has never grown faster. I love this stuff so much that I buy it in bulk.   My boyfriend, who is not black, also uses this stuff to moisturize his scalp and he loves it too since it helps prevent flakes! I would TOTALLY recommend this for anybody looking for a strong moisturizer that is not oily.   It leaves behind no white residue so even if you have dark hair it works great!</li>
    <li> The product just laid on my hair and did not really moisturize. I would wake up in the morning with hard hair due to just laying on the surface. I think it will work for some types of hair. Just not mine</li>
    <li> I love love this moisturizer it really soften the hair and it smells very good. I will definatelly purchase again.</li>
    <li> This just a note; this perm is not just for Black people as some stylist continue to discuss.  I know because sometimes when I go to my stylist she is putting the perm in White women&#x27;s hair.  This is when I lived in Philadelphia, PA.  may be in other areas the stylists don&#x27;t advertise it.  I have this perm and I love it.  It&#x27;s very easy to wear,  I put the moisturizer on every other day; sometimes at night, sometimes in the morning.  I use it in the summer about 2x per week, usu.  Mon and then Fri.</li>
    <li> This leaves your hair amazingly soft and shiny. my only complaint is that it broke out  my face. Which is possibly an easy fix... keep my hair pulled back and out of my face. Normally that easy to do especially with a puff or a twist out but its harder to do as your hair gets longer or as you lay around the house lounging and not thinking about it. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all... but this product definitely causes my face to break out which sucks because it truly its the best I&#x27;ve use on my natural hair. I&#x27;d probably give it a 3.5 star rating but since that not possible... 4 it is!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it anymore since I cut all my hair off, but while I still had hair it was great.</li>
    <li> I have tried different moisturizers and this one is the only one that quenches my hairs thirst besides water. I mixed it with another moisturizer and they keep my hair soft and not dry. I am looking for something that i do not have to comibine with something else to get the results . My hair is curly and when i apply the lotion it hydrtates and coats it protecting from dryness. Good lotion. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this on Amazon.  I love that it was a nice large size that was reasonably price too!  Plan to buy more soon.</li>
    <li> Love how this makes hair perform. The BEST!</li>
    <li> The product is awesome for natural hair! Moisturizes w/o oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little bit cheaper elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Get the mist too.</li>
    <li> This is a re-order.  I used to order from a Beauty supply store- no more!</li>
    <li> Ok everybody I&#x27;m a black female and I haven&#x27;t had a perm in my hair in 2months so my hair is natural....I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good moisterizer for my hair...I had this product in my closet ...I use this on synethetic wigs like curly hair...It makes the wig hair feels like human hair...I very been using it for years....So I decided to use on my natural hair...Omg!!! this moisturizer straighten my hair like I had a perm...My hair is so soft I wear my hair conrow during the winter time I wear wigs...I&#x27;m going to get the shampoo and conditioner the whole line..</li>
    <li> This has done wonders for my son&#x27;s hair he is 2 and he hates for us to do his hair in the morning and this helps his tangles so much.</li>
    <li> Loved it it&#x27;s so much I think i&#x27;ll use it for  a long while. Really impressed with how long it keeps  my curls in&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s August 2013 and I&#x27;m still using it... There is really a lot in there</li>
    <li> I use this product daily it work&#x27;s wonders on my hair I love this quantity for the price very fair-</li>
    <li> I love the size of this product for the price I can re-fill my smaller bottles. I love the convenience of having it delivered to my door. I use this product to maintain my weave it works great with curly hair.</li>
    <li> Wet you hair, tease this product in and no frizz. Works excellent on permed ethnic hair that is not suppose to be wet too often.  This product dries with your hair and leaves you hair soft, even after it dries.  I am definitely going to continue buying this as I have been now for awhile.  When you put it in after wetting your hair, it allows you to finger tease your hair and curls it up nice.  (short hair)&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing about this product is no greasy build up and it can be used by anyone of any race.  I hope this helps someone in deciding.  Also attach a comment please.  I would love to know someone actually trusted my rating.</li>
    <li> Just LOVE this product for my natural hair;  it really brings out the natural curl no chemical processing needed; I&#x27;m sorry it took so long to learn about this. I recommend this to all my friends that now rock the short natural look.</li>
    <li> I use this product in conjunction with the mist.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products, but this is the one!!!  I have short, curly, texturized hair and with these products my hair is soft, shiny with defined curls!!!  This is the one!  I won&#x27;t use anything else.  A plus is that here, I can order a huge bottle.  Yes, yes, yes!!!</li>
    <li> I use it to moisturize my hair and it keeps it soft and moisturized all day. My hair also smells good.</li>
    <li> I like how this finishing lotion leaves my hair.  It keeps it moisterized and soft and MOST of all my husband loves it how it looks on me.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The best for my hair! Got here early and pretty cheap compared to all the other offers! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Great product and I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> The only product I use.  Keeps my hair soft and moist.</li>
    <li> this is good for the hair,it adds a nice balance with a sheen and texture. you only need a small portion. the fragrance is mild.good value for the price.</li>
    <li> After seeing the ad on TV. I decided to try it.I am glad that I did ,they are the best products that I, have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I see a change in my hair. It really works . I would recommend it women to use.</li>
    <li> This product makes my daughters very kinky hair look super shiny when wearing in twists. It also seems to be very healthy for her hair as it is growing nicely. I also like the fact that I can apply more very couple of days when her twists look dull.</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer.  I apply relaxer only to my roots 3 - 4 times a year.  I started a healthy hair growth journey last year and I&#x27;ve been through quite a few moisturizers and other products that weren&#x27;t working for me.  But, this lotion is amazing.  I noticed a change in my hair right away.  It was more manageable and shinier and just looked all-around healthier.  Of course, I use other products in my regimen, but this is my go-to moisturizer.  I like to seal it with argan oil or organic coconut oil.  I believe it has helped me to maintain the length of my hair as I grow it out.  I don&#x27;t use it on my scalp.  I only apply it to the strands of my hair every night and a little bit in the morning.  For my scalp, I only use the castor oil at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CTTZQQ/ref&#x3D;as_li_ss_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B003CTTZQQ&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;dila-20</li>
    <li> This hair lotion is the only hair lotion I have found for my Type 4 hair.  It provides my hair with moisture, softness, and sheen.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Product is great for natural hair. It keeps it moistened and prevents breakage. I use it as a water based moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Very easy to use--leaving your hair soft, shiny and curly.  I would recommend this product to anyone that has natural hair</li>
    <li> very good product for curly hair. this product gives hair the Moisture it needs and  doesnt dry out. i put it evey morning with a little bit water</li>
    <li> This keeps my hair mousturized but only if i twist it after. If i just lay it on my head it will make my air stiff and quite sticky. But overall nice product :)</li>
    <li> I just love the way this product makes my hair look</li>
    <li> Any product must be suited for the appropriate hair type. I have 3b/c hair that is color treated, fine and dry. My hair has a tendency to be frizzy. This product prevents the frizzies after the 2nd application. After the 1st application it did not feel particularly moist after it dried . But by the 2nd it felt silky and amazing! You should NOT really use heat with this product imo because it contains glycerine. Nevertheless I can wrap my hair to get a nice straight set with this product. You can also set this in some other fashions like maybe twists for a wavy look. I have not tried it with a roller set so I can not comment on how it does for that. But I do not think glycerine does well with blowdrying or curling at all! you might get too much steam and scorch or something. I am on a no heat regimen so this is just fine for me. It takes away the frizzies and makes it silky and very soft to the touch and smooth feeling. If you have naturally fine, straight hair it might possibly be too heavy for you possibly (I do not know). And if you have 4c hair you might want to add some castor oil to it to make the balance a bit better for heavier hair.</li>
    <li> but think I will like it.  Fourteen more words required.  Ten more words required.  Six more words required.  Two more</li>
    <li> awesome products, really moisture your hair</li>
    <li> Love this product, works wonders on my hair.</li>
    <li> As described arrived on time..</li>
    <li> I have been all natural for a few years now and this is the only product that moisturizes, gives that soft feel and holds my natural curls. I feel it works best on african american hair and when your hair is wet, it holds even more moisture!</li>
