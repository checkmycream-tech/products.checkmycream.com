### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is a wonderful allnatural product that does protect you from the sun.</li>
      <li>I was so happy with this product!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a trade off for awesome protection!</li>
      <li>I followed the directions on this product (basically \\&quot;don&#x27;t apply too much\\&quot;), and it performed beautifully for me.  </li>
      <li>But I find that Desert Essences Tea Tree face wash works beautifully to remove it.  </li>
      <li>I cannot use any of the chemical sunblocking agents, they all off-gas a great deal.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great</li>
      <li>great-</li>
      <li>Neither my mother nor myself is happy with it now.</li>
      <li>I told everyone about this sunscreen, it WAS that good.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve searched for years for a sunscreen that I could use, as we spend a good portion of our winters in Florida.  </li>
      <li>Works good for me.</li>
      <li>The best sunscreen,it is rated number 1 by experts as being safe for you in terms of the ingredients, it does not have harmful chemicals in it as do most others.....</li>
      <li>The sun protection is great and lasts many hours.   </li>
      <li>So just know, very good, very natural, great company...</li>
      <li>Its amazing.  </li>
      <li>Nice and creamy.  </li>
      <li>The ingredients are spectacular.  </li>
      <li>Effective, nourishing and nicely waterproof.  </li>
      <li>the most optimum cream for sun protection.</li>
      <li>It honestly seems as if this stuff enhanced my burn.</li>
      <li>I also use it on my toddler and the application is very easy, like applying lotion.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best I have found that does not have any harmful additives.</li>
      <li>So that is a trade off for natural, but if you have dryer skin it may be perfect.</li>
      <li>Though I&#x27;ve liked the ingredients or texture of some better than UV Natural, this is the best compromise of all worlds, I think.  </li>
      <li>I love this product because:  </li>
      <li>For me, I love the stuff and don&#x27;t think I could to my job without it.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Like most sunscreens do.  </li>
      <li>We love it.  </li>
      <li>LOVE this for my kids.  </li>
      <li>so we cannot tell how much more sunscreen in the tube.  </li>
      <li>be sure to go to the website for the Environmental Working Group - they ar</li>
      <li>so for a while I am gonna buy one more.</li>
      <li>I even liked the oilyness of it as it kept my skin moist and went on so smooth and easy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;Finally a great sunscreen that contains natural ingredients, namely Zinc ...</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product for those of us who are allergic to any of the other sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t cheap</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does not leave a ghostly white film on surface of skin, so this is great.</li>
      <li>Then just use good old soap and a washcloth in the shower when you get home.</li>
      <li>I am also very happy that this is a zinc block because titanium dioxide is not much better than the chemical sunscreens.</li>
      <li>Reef friendly-</li>
      <li>I know this is effective because I live in the mountains in colorado, but never get burned or even develop any color.</li>
      <li>What I liked MOST OF ALL was that it did not turn my skin white!</li>
      <li>And after reading reviews on the Skin Deep cosmetic safety database I wondered if I was doing my skin more harm than good, so I decided to switch to a more natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I needed a good product that would last all day and not burn my eyes.  </li>
      <li>And, it is true,</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are other very good natural sunscreen products out there, but they tend to leave your skin looking a bit more lighter / whiter.</li>
      <li>and it seems running out quickly.  </li>
      <li>but it run out quickly.</li>
      <li>I am also very happy that this company makes spf for lips with just zinc, this being extremely hard to find!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t love the smell at first, it doesn&#x27;t smell like much, maybe art clay or something, but we got used to it.  </li>
      <li>After not being able to find it in any store this past winter - I was going to Hawaii, so needed a good sunscreen, I ordered it from Amazon.    </li>
      <li>They have updated their formula, but I am confident that the new formula will be just as good as the old looking at the new ingredients.</li>
      <li>But it provides great, long lasting protection and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and healthy even after use for days and weeks on end.</li>
      <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I am an elementary school PE instructor in California</li>
      <li>Rarely did I have to reapply.  </li>
      <li>A bit greasy, but worth it.</li>
      <li>I have been using uv natural for many years.</li>
      <li>Maybe all the &#x27;natural&#x27; sunscreens are like this, but I&#x27;ll keep looking for something better.</li>
      <li>[...] This product has one of the best overall ratings - low toxicity and high UV blockage.</li>
      <li>but I my shampoo takes it right off.</li>
      <li>oh,, when you wash your hands after, the soap and water just seem to slide right over, because of the wax in the spf on your hands, but if your hands aren&#x27;t in water there&#x27;s nothing to notice.&lt;br</li>
      <li>conclusion is that it&#x27;s more comfortable and convenient to sweat it out in a hat and long sleeves than use this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>junk\\&quot; just all natural ingredients that are only good for them.  </li>
      <li>At least, its the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t use it very much</li>
      <li>You did not need very much.  </li>
      <li>Have gone through many tubes of this sunblock for the entire family and will continue to purchase.  </li>
      <li>to cream up, as it is light and not a problem to coat sensitive skin areas like the neck etc.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m switching to another sunscreen (most likely Shiseido&#x27;s SPF 55/60) after finishing it.</li>
      <li>First I feel that it is</li>
      <li>But, it&#x27;s very non-irritating, so they did something right about choosing non-harsh ingredients.  </li>
      <li>My daughter has a very light European complexion and easily burns, but this product worked and stayed in place, even with almost 2h of constant swimming in the ocean.</li>
      <li>My daughter is very light skinned (red hair and blue eyes if that is any indication) and burns very easily, with just one application of this sunscreen her skin stayed protected for the whole day at the beach (and we live in Florida).</li>
      <li>The old sunblock was very oily, but my dry skin really loved this and it never broke me out.</li>
      <li>It lasts long- with good judgement, I usually only need to apply once.  </li>
      <li>and they lasted us the whole summer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gentle soap; I put it on with a loofa, wait 1 min, and rinse it off.  </li>
      <li>While it does feel very greasy and sticky going on, after minutes, my normally dry skin felt only nicely moisturized.  </li>
      <li>After my first day of using this all I can say is WOW.</li>
      <li>Eco Logical All Natural Sunscreen for Face SPF30+]] )</li>
      <li>I love the fact that there are no chemicals in this sunblock, not just because of the issues with using chemicals on my face, but this mineral block does not break down in sunlight.</li>
      <li>The new version has less oils in it, but I am sure it will still work for my skin.  </li>
      <li>I find it far less waxy than similar products, so it&#x27;s far more comfortable in humid weather.  </li>
      <li>It is natural and works very well</li>
      <li>Two friends with oily and normal skin agreed that they preferred it to the others I had.    </li>
      <li>Expensive, but worth it for safe protection right?</li>
      <li>I am very  surprised to see a reviewer say they were burned wearing this.</li>
      <li>Most of the zinc oxide sunscreens are really hard to wash off, but this one is effective using very little and it stays on!  </li>
      <li>UV Natural changed the formulation!</li>
      <li>Goes on clear, no coloring&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>just natural.</li>
      <li>I bought 1 bottle of the adult and 1bottle of the childrens</li>
      <li>I know I applied enough because I could feel and see it on my skin, the stuff is really sticky.</li>
      <li>But I am overly sensitive to things, so I still recommend it to everyone else.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The new product is not the same as the old product.  I found UV Natural back in 2007 at a health food store.  It wasn&#x27;t cheap but I needed a good product that would last all day and not burn my eyes.  I was so happy with this product! I work outdoors all day and I am also very active swimming, diving. This product did not burn my eyes at all! Even when swimming in the ocean.  I even liked the oilyness of it as it kept my skin moist and went on so smooth and easy. You did not need very much.  What I liked MOST OF ALL was that it did not turn my skin white! Like most sunscreens do.  I told everyone about this sunscreen, it WAS that good.  After not being able to find it in any store this past winter - I was going to Hawaii, so needed a good sunscreen, I ordered it from Amazon.    UV Natural changed the formulation! No longer is it oily, nor does it go on with ease. It leaves your face WHITE.  It is not the same product and I am very disappointed that it is not labeled as \\&quot;NEW\\&quot; .  Neither my mother nor myself is happy with it now. It still does not burn your eyes, and some folks will like it that it is not oily. But not this woman, Sorry UV Natural, you lost a big fan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreens-- all claiming to avoid the burning irritation and toxic chemicals of mainstream brands.  Though I&#x27;ve liked the ingredients or texture of some better than UV Natural, this is the best compromise of all worlds, I think.  At least, its the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  A little goes a long way and during a scuba diving trip in Nicaragua, I would find that one early morning application would keep me from burning the entire day.  While it does feel very greasy and sticky going on, after minutes, my normally dry skin felt only nicely moisturized.  Two friends with oily and normal skin agreed that they preferred it to the others I had.    I love this product because:  It performs well- I&#x27;ve never had a burn using it.  It lasts long- with good judgement, I usually only need to apply once.  My skin feels well moisturized all day.  Not tested on animals.  Recyclable bottle.  One bottle has been lasting me all summer (so far.)  The bottle is small and concurs with airline regulations for carry-ons.  I don&#x27;t get irritation, even around the eyes.  Reef friendly- I don&#x27;t feel guilty polluting the water while protecting myself.    I don&#x27;t like that:  If my hair touches my face, it can get greasy.  The ingredients aren&#x27;t quite as simple/pure as those in the Badger sunscreen I have.  It takes a while to apply (sticky.)  It does take some attention to get remove in the shower, but I&#x27;d hardly call it a hassle.</li>
    <li> I got totally sunburned even after reapplying and I was only doing errands around town in partial sunlight for about an hour.  But, it&#x27;s very non-irritating, so they did something right about choosing non-harsh ingredients.  I just wish it protected against the sun.  Hard to believe they have the correct zinc% listed.</li>
    <li> I have multiple chemical sensitivity and any sort of cosmetic fume can make me very ill - whether it be from preservatives, fragrances, etc. I cannot use any of the chemical sunblocking agents, they all off-gas a great deal. This product was my lifesaver the last two years. However, it is heavy and it takes a few moments for the oil to soak in. That is the trade of for using only the zinc as a sun block - they can only make its particles so small, so it creates a thicker product. But it does not leave a white film. One neds to apply very little - I will squeeze some into my palm and then pat it on with my finger tips, to spread it lightly.  Alas, as of this year even this product has a small fume that irritates my respiratory system. But I am overly sensitive to things, so I still recommend it to everyone else. The sun protection is great and lasts many hours.   be sure to go to the website for the Environmental Working Group - they ar the folks who conducted the independent study of over 1000 sunscreens, only to find that over 80% on the market do not supply the UV protection that their label claims. They also rate the chemical toxicity level of each product. [...] This product has one of the best overall ratings - low toxicity and high UV blockage.</li>
    <li> I have been using uv natural for many years. They have updated their formula, but I am confident that the new formula will be just as good as the old looking at the new ingredients. There is a lot of skin cancer in my family so I have been wearing sunscreen/sunblock since I was 19 and I am now almost 36. I love the fact that there are no chemicals in this sunblock, not just because of the issues with using chemicals on my face, but this mineral block does not break down in sunlight. I am also very happy that this is a zinc block because titanium dioxide is not much better than the chemical sunscreens. The old sunblock was very oily, but my dry skin really loved this and it never broke me out. The new version has less oils in it, but I am sure it will still work for my skin.  This sunblock is very expensive and not sold in stores near me, but this does not keep me from using it, and a little goes a long way making the tube last a very long time. I also use it on my toddler and the application is very easy, like applying lotion. I know this is effective because I live in the mountains in colorado, but never get burned or even develop any color. I have had to go down 1 shade in foundation after wearing this sunblock and I am paler than ever in the face.   I am also very happy that this company makes spf for lips with just zinc, this being extremely hard to find! I am very  surprised to see a reviewer say they were burned wearing this. This has been overall the opposite of my experience.</li>
    <li> In trying to remove the horrible ingredients in regular sunscreen from us, I came across this brand.  We love it.  I bought 1 bottle of the adult and 1bottle of the childrens and they lasted us the whole summer. It is super thick so you only need a very little bit.  My daughter is very light skinned (red hair and blue eyes if that is any indication) and burns very easily, with just one application of this sunscreen her skin stayed protected for the whole day at the beach (and we live in Florida). Rarely did I have to reapply.  This is the only brand of sunscreen we use now.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen because of the recommendation from the environmental group.  It is very expensive for a sunscreen and I used it for a few weeks and it seems running out quickly.  The tube color is almost the same color of the sunscreen itself so we cannot tell how much more sunscreen in the tube.  I believe when I bought it the filling was not really full because it is very thick creamy so I didn&#x27;t use it very much but it run out quickly. The sunscreen itself is very moist and I don&#x27;t know the other brands so for a while I am gonna buy one more.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions on this product (basically \\&quot;don&#x27;t apply too much\\&quot;), and it performed beautifully for me.  I find it far less waxy than similar products, so it&#x27;s far more comfortable in humid weather.  I do find it hard to remove, though that&#x27;s true for all sunscreens in my experience.  (I&#x27;d rather have it linger at the surface anyway!)  But I find that Desert Essences Tea Tree face wash works beautifully to remove it.  It&#x27;s a gentle soap; I put it on with a loofa, wait 1 min, and rinse it off.  Voila--my skin is back to normal!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful allnatural product that does protect you from the sun. I do like it, but it is greasy because it uses a lot of oils for sunscreen. So that is a trade off for natural, but if you have dryer skin it may be perfect. I don&#x27;t use it on my face as I have oily skin, not that I would break out but haven&#x27;t risked it. So just know, very good, very natural, great company...a tad slick.</li>
    <li> Really needed to address this product, especially based on the one previous review.  This is a wonderful product for those of us who are allergic to any of the other sunscreens.  I&#x27;ve searched for years for a sunscreen that I could use, as we spend a good portion of our winters in Florida.  I even had severe reactions to the formulations that my dermatologist suggested, but could wear this product.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does \\&quot;stick with you\\&quot;, but that&#x27;s even going in and out of the Gulf (and I don&#x27;t usually re-apply, even though I should).&lt;br /&gt;Put on a thin coat. Then just use good old soap and a washcloth in the shower when you get home.</li>
    <li> This is like glue.  It took 2 weeks for the lotion to wash off.  However, i did not burn.</li>
    <li> LOVE this for my kids.  First I feel that it is \\&quot;no junk\\&quot; just all natural ingredients that are only good for them.  Second, the coverage can&#x27;t be beat.  My kids have NEVER burned and we are out in the poolr 3-4 times a week in the summer.  I didn&#x27;t love the smell at first, it doesn&#x27;t smell like much, maybe art clay or something, but we got used to it.  It is very thick and messy going on, but you don&#x27;t have to reapply hardly ever.  Its amazing.  And, it is true, a little goes a very long way, especially on little bodies.  Love this stuff.  Only stuff for us.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different types of natural sunscreens and have been really disappointed with what I find, until now. This is by far the best I have found that does not have any harmful additives. It is pretty thick but it stays on through sweating and 110 degree weather. It is kinda pricey but lasts.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on clear, no coloring&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Hard to find locally at natural food stores&lt;br /&gt;- Pricey (but again, you get what you pay for)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;Finally a great sunscreen that contains natural ingredients, namely Zinc ... the most optimum cream for sun protection. (If you ever saw a life guard at the beach or public pool with a big blotch of white cream on their nose, that&#x27;s Zinc). After you apply it and massage it in, it may look a bit oily / shiny on your skin. That&#x27;s good. But if you don&#x27;t like that look, that just wipe some of it off with either your hands or a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other very good natural sunscreen products out there, but they tend to leave your skin looking a bit more lighter / whiter.</li>
    <li> Effective, nourishing and nicely waterproof.  Have gone through many tubes of this sunblock for the entire family and will continue to purchase.  A bit greasy, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just too thick and greasy. It is natural and works very well but it&#x27;s almost the consistency of body butter.</li>
    <li> I use this on my kids bc it is natural.  It&#x27;s nice and thick and stays on for a long time.  My kids have never had a sunburn using this.  The smell isn&#x27;t great but it&#x27;s a trade off for awesome protection!</li>
    <li> I am an elementary school PE instructor in California so I must use sunscreen every day. With frequent use, regular sunscreens left my skin dry and flaky and caused breakouts on my face. And after reading reviews on the Skin Deep cosmetic safety database I wondered if I was doing my skin more harm than good, so I decided to switch to a more natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UV Natural is like no other sunscreen I have used and it took a little getting used to. It is thick and greasy/oily and contains zinc (an active ingredient that is actually safe) so it gives skin a white hue. But it provides great, long lasting protection and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and healthy even after use for days and weeks on end. It can be hard to wash off with regular soap but I my shampoo takes it right off. No one else in my family likes it, but they don&#x27;t have to wear sunscreen on a daily basis and suffer the harsh effects of regular use. For me, I love the stuff and don&#x27;t think I could to my job without it.</li>
    <li> Feels thick and will definitely last compared to commercially-tauted brands. A 1/4\\&quot; - 1/2\\&quot; dab is enough to cover your face or hands.  I didn&#x27;t realize sunscreens were meant to be removed after use until reading other reviews on this one.  Washing it off takes oil so I&#x27;m switching to another sunscreen (most likely Shiseido&#x27;s SPF 55/60) after finishing it.</li>
    <li> Nice and creamy.  No strong smell to burn eyes or nose. The ingredients are spectacular.  Absorbs well.  Works good for me.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I can use as I am allergic to everything else.  Most of the zinc oxide sunscreens are really hard to wash off, but this one is effective using very little and it stays on!  It&#x27;s kind of expensive and I have to buy it online......but it&#x27;s worth it to me because I am out on the ocean almost everyday.  Between this sunscreen and my sunscreen hat.....I&#x27;m well protected.</li>
    <li> Im out in the sun a lot, and I&#x27;ve been using conventional sunscreen (banana boat etc.) but after reading about the various harmful chemicals in these, I did some research and decided on this all natural sunscreen. Expensive, but worth it for safe protection right? After my first day of using this all I can say is WOW. I got absolutely FRIED by the sun after just a few hours (including a re-application of this stuff). I know I applied enough because I could feel and see it on my skin, the stuff is really sticky. It just did nothing to block the sun, and I mean nothing. It honestly seems as if this stuff enhanced my burn. So I get home and take a shower, after literally laughing about how bad my burn looked, and the stuff is so sticky it won&#x27;t wash off! So not only did it not work, you can&#x27;t get rid of it! I feel deceived (this stuff was expensive!), but at the same time I can&#x27;t help but laugh at how abominably awful this product is. I&#x27;m hoping I can return it. They should sell this stuff in practical joke shops.</li>
    <li> The best sunscreen,it is rated number 1 by experts as being safe for you in terms of the ingredients, it does not have harmful chemicals in it as do most others.....one slight drawback, it is greasy....but it absorbs after a while.</li>
    <li> 40 bucks for spf, but still. weird thing about this is that it feels like it&#x27;s going to be insanely greasy, but it&#x27;s actually a little drying, it&#x27;s weird. I think it smells great- just natural. never noticed any other problem with it. oh,, when you wash your hands after, the soap and water just seem to slide right over, because of the wax in the spf on your hands, but if your hands aren&#x27;t in water there&#x27;s nothing to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. This sunscreen does work. That&#x27;s obvious because when I miss a spot, that spot burns, and the rest of me doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;2. Doesn&#x27;t contain chemical sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s so sticky that it turns me into a walking flytrap. After a bike ride my skin is carpeted with little flies and dust, and I can&#x27;t wipe it off; it just smears in. I wouldn&#x27;t use it at the beach because then I&#x27;d be walking sandpaper.&lt;br /&gt;2. I can&#x27;t touch anything while wearing this sunblock. It leaves white marks on leather furniture, stains my clothes and bags, stains the armrests in the car.&lt;br /&gt;3. It takes some scrubbing to get it off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion is that it&#x27;s more comfortable and convenient to sweat it out in a hat and long sleeves than use this sunscreen. Maybe all the &#x27;natural&#x27; sunscreens are like this, but I&#x27;ll keep looking for something better.</li>
    <li> 4 stars for The UV natural adult SPF 30 sunscreen protection cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to cream up, as it is light and not a problem to coat sensitive skin areas like the neck etc. No need to rub it in it just clings on naturally.&lt;br /&gt;It does not leave a ghostly white film on surface of skin, so this is great. However, this may be a bad sign of nano particles or not the perfect natural ingredients, not sure. I hope it IS all natural and free of mineral oil derivatives and bad stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, it didn&#x27;t leave us a burning hot feeling like the other sunscreen we purchased. (see my review of [[ASIN:B004TTH1GO Eco Logical All Natural Sunscreen for Face SPF30+]] ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we don&#x27;t like and therefore no 5 stars is the sticky goo feel. Sweating like crazy as soon as I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, it does the job and keeps us from burning. My daughter has a very light European complexion and easily burns, but this product worked and stayed in place, even with almost 2h of constant swimming in the ocean.</li>
