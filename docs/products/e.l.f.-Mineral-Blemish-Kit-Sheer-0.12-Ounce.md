### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It covers blemishes perfectly and the powder is non-greasy.</li>
      <li>It works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Have used e.l.f. Mineral Blemish Kit for couple years, works wonderful.</li>
      <li>Covered everything perfectly.</li>
      <li>This product is great.</li>
      <li>Aside from that, the product itself it great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
      <li>I know the price is alluring, but bareMinerals is superior.  </li>
      <li>Works really good at healing pimples with out over drying</li>
      <li>Works ever bit as good as name brand product</li>
      <li>This stuff is just as good as the well known brand blemish therapy.</li>
      <li>I am so glad that I found it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It is not an absolutely amazing product</li>
      <li>but I take good care of it &amp; it looks better.</li>
      <li>I wear this underneath makeup every day and even use it on days when I don&#x27;t want to wear makeup, but still want to look nice.</li>
      <li>Handy to get rid of any remaining stubborn blemishes.  </li>
      <li>I had more than a couple of places of moderate-severe acne at the time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, for now I&#x27;m sticking with this until I find something better</li>
      <li>(woohoo, no salicylic acid in it like most)</li>
      <li>goes on without a mask effect, so she tells me :)</li>
      <li>Love love love it.</li>
      <li>This product could be much better..</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>There aren&#x27;t many kits that can conceal and treat blemishes.</li>
      <li>The price just makes it so much better.</li>
      <li>it creates a highlighting effect, doesn&#x27;t blend easily</li>
      <li>The brush is fine</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my skin</li>
      <li>Fantastic product-</li>
      <li>it goes on smoothly, lasts all day and vanishes on my skin.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s light weight</li>
      <li>I have never had such amazing coverage in a powder!</li>
      <li>If you have moderate acne, consider shelling out the $ for the bareminerals kind, but honestly, I find myself happy using a homemade remedy- aloe vera and dead sea salt dissolved in distilled water.</li>
      <li>I noticed right away my pores shrinking and blackheads going away!</li>
      <li>This one does both, the color is bright enough that you don&#x27;t look like you painted over a blemish.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with it so far.</li>
      <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t pay much..</li>
      <li>with much more product and much lower price point...</li>
      <li>This product absolutely deserves more positive reviews.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I use this with a powder brush and dust it lightly over my whole face before bed to help any clogged pores go away.</li>
      <li>but it is so light it doesn&#x27;t really work on medium-dark toned skin (unless you blend with another powder)</li>
      <li>I love this product soooo much I ordered multifies, it works very well,</li>
      <li>and it was almost gone by the 3rd day, with no picking.dried it up nicely.</li>
      <li>Just as good as the &#x27;other&#x27; brand label...</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t like this Elf powder: the powder didn&#x27;t come out very easily, the container itself felt very low quality and was not exactly effortless in its design, but most importantly, the powder did not absorb well into the brush or into my skin.</li>
      <li>I expected a cheap replacement, &amp; some disappointment...NOPE!!</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t touched this stuff since the first week</li>
      <li>but it gets 3 stars for actually helping treat pimples (unlike most makeup)...</li>
      <li>/&gt;maybe for the fair-skinned person who gets the occasional pimple, this would be ok.</li>
      <li>I love bareMinerals and had high hopes for this product, but it did not dry out my blemishes or reduce inflammation.  </li>
      <li>With elf acne foundation regular use I haven&#x27;t needed it anymore, but will use it if any problems occur very quickly.</li>
      <li>The product has decent coverage (though not as much as other powder concealers I&#x27;ve tried) and is light-feeling and nice.</li>
      <li>If you like less products in your life and don&#x27;t love cosmetics, that might be worth a try.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s pretty much the main point when using a spot concealer, for me, I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much to cover up blemishes - but it is a nice powder and provides a little coverage.</li>
      <li>My skin is very oily &amp; acne prone</li>
      <li>although this doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage at all...</li>
      <li>but like I said I am very  picky when it comes to things like that.</li>
      <li>This works very well to hide blemishes and it isn&#x27;t noticable</li>
      <li>and I really was a critic, having tried everything in my 35 yrs.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice if it worked or not</li>
      <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t blend into my skin, so it just sat on top of the spots I was trying to reduce and coverup-making them look more noticeable and made me feel worse about my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the name brand in the past and this seems to be just as effective.</li>
      <li>I usually use Bare Minerals (which is also good), but my monthly budget could not afford it this time.</li>
      <li>I am very pale, so I can get away with wearing this on its own well.</li>
      <li>This has really helped clear up some acne and hides blemishes well!</li>
      <li>I ordered this with high hopes.</li>
      <li>It is a very light smell and is not overwhelming</li>
      <li>Mature skin, but cystic breakouts break my heart.  </li>
      <li>: It does help acne, it doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of a pimple, but helps to shrink it underneath your makeup, it has tea tree oil &amp; sulfur  </li>
      <li>Save yourself the problems and order this one from elf directly.</li>
      <li>This is the only real deal remedy, because it has sulfur, which has been used for centuries in curing problem skin.</li>
      <li>Bare Minerals sulfur treatment far surpasses this stuff.</li>
      <li>I still like my original brand, but for half the price &amp; same quality, I have changed a couple products.</li>
      <li>I have ordered this same product directly from elf previously and only ordered it on Amazon because of the free shipping.</li>
      <li>When combined, this seems to reduce the size and redness enough to allow my regular bb cream can do a decent job covering up.  </li>
      <li>Not a Bare Minerals product; very surprised upon opening the package and realizing it was labeled &#x27;Elf&#x27;.</li>
      <li>After washing my face thoroughly I apply MARGARITE zinc cream to my acne (tinted) and then use this powder, then I go over it with my physicians formula foundation powder (like bare minerals) and try and blend the two...</li>
      <li>The only remedy for my adult acne.</li>
      <li>I used my bare minerals blemish therapy often</li>
      <li>The scent is slightly noticeable at first, but fades as you blend the product in.</li>
      <li>It has an odd smell (I didn&#x27;t mind the bare minerals scent at all), is much lighter than bare minerals, and just doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s 3% sulfur, same as the Bare Minerals product and works just as well.</li>
      <li>I am very picky when it comes to products with an odd odor.</li>

<li> I use Bare Minerals though this product isn&#x27;t expensive enough to return; intend to use what I&#x27;ve purchased and order via established Bare Minerals vendor.</li>
<li> /&gt;Overall, I use it not as a miracle worker or to really help get rid of acne, but as a preventative measure so my pimples don&#x27;t get worse.</li>
<li> The box was crushed and there was no brush.</li>
<li> It does have a slightly burnt sulfur smell</li>
<li> My pimples take less than a day to go away.</li>
<li> This powder works so well - the horrible red bumps dry out quickly with no picking.</li>
<li> The few times I did use it, it didn&#x27;t seem to help at all.</li>
<li> Preferably, a few times per day.</li>
<li> In a few days they were gone after receiving this powder.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This make-up does not cake or anything like a foundation would. It covers blemishes perfectly and the powder is non-greasy. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this same product directly from elf previously and only ordered it on Amazon because of the free shipping. I guess you get what you pay for because I don&#x27;t believe that this is the same product I was getting from elf. It smells weird and does not do the job. Save yourself the problems and order this one from elf directly.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is not an absolutely amazing product but it does the job. The price just makes it so much better. My only con is the smell. I am very picky when it comes to products with an odd odor. It is a very light smell and is not overwhelming but like I said I am very  picky when it comes to things like that. But this complaint is no reason to not like this product.</li>
    <li> Handy to get rid of any remaining stubborn blemishes.  In a few days they were gone after receiving this powder.  With elf acne foundation regular use I haven&#x27;t needed it anymore, but will use it if any problems occur very quickly.</li>
    <li> This works very well to hide blemishes and it isn&#x27;t noticable</li>
    <li> Works ever bit as good as name brand product</li>
    <li> This stuff is just as good as the well known brand blemish therapy. I have been using that brand for years. I decided to try this based on price. It works wonderfully. The brush is fine and I don&#x27;t get the reviews stating the powder is hard to get out. Turn it over, tap or shake then turn over again. It&#x27;s not rocket science.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much to cover up blemishes - but it is a nice powder and provides a little coverage.</li>
    <li> I love this product soooo much I ordered multifies, it works very well,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy about the product or the brush.. Just my opinion.  Its hard to get the powder out unless you hold it upside down or jam the brush in the holes.. and then the powder just falls off the brush.  The few times I did use it, it didn&#x27;t seem to help at all. Glad I didn&#x27;t pay much..</li>
    <li> I have never had such amazing coverage in a powder! Love it!</li>
    <li> The product has decent coverage (though not as much as other powder concealers I&#x27;ve tried) and is light-feeling and nice. It blends well with very pale skin. I like the brush applicator. I haven&#x27;t seen the sulphur do anything for clearing blemishes. The scent is slightly noticeable at first, but fades as you blend the product in.</li>
    <li> I have oily, acne prone skin, so I like this powder a lot. However, the only downside is that the applicator brush is pretty useless.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice if it worked or not</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the name brand in the past and this seems to be just as effective.</li>
    <li> This product could be much better..but it gets 3 stars for actually helping treat pimples (unlike most makeup)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons : VERY HARD to get powder out, the design is flawed, the \\&quot;color\\&quot; is supposed to be sheer but it is so light it doesn&#x27;t really work on medium-dark toned skin (unless you blend with another powder) it creates a highlighting effect, doesn&#x27;t blend easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It does help acne, it doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of a pimple, but helps to shrink it underneath your makeup, it has tea tree oil &amp; sulfur  (woohoo, no salicylic acid in it like most), it&#x27;s light weight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I use it not as a miracle worker or to really help get rid of acne, but as a preventative measure so my pimples don&#x27;t get worse. My skin is very oily &amp; acne prone but I take good care of it &amp; it looks better. After washing my face thoroughly I apply MARGARITE zinc cream to my acne (tinted) and then use this powder, then I go over it with my physicians formula foundation powder (like bare minerals) and try and blend the two... my face is so oily I can&#x27;t wear liquid foundation, so this routine helps me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for now I&#x27;m sticking with this until I find something better</li>
    <li> Love love love it. The only remedy for my adult acne. I don&#x27;t have a lot but I get some skin imperfections, let&#x27;s put it this way, ever since I stopped my birth control. This needs to be applied quite often, though. Preferably, a few times per day. Keep dusting it on the problem spot. This is the only real deal remedy, because it has sulfur, which has been used for centuries in curing problem skin. Forget about all those acids they offer you in skin clearing complexes - those only irritate you and don&#x27;t do the proper job.</li>
    <li> Not a Bare Minerals product; very surprised upon opening the package and realizing it was labeled &#x27;Elf&#x27;. I use Bare Minerals though this product isn&#x27;t expensive enough to return; intend to use what I&#x27;ve purchased and order via established Bare Minerals vendor.</li>
    <li> I noticed right away my pores shrinking and blackheads going away! It does have a slightly burnt sulfur smell so I recommend applying it before your makeup instead of just wearing it alone</li>
    <li> Just as good as the &#x27;other&#x27; brand label...with much more product and much lower price point...</li>
    <li> although this doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage at all...and that&#x27;s pretty much the main point when using a spot concealer, for me, I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Works really good at healing pimples with out over drying</li>
    <li> I use this over liquid foundation on forehead, nose and chin to cover small blemishes, control shine and prevent breakouts. it goes on smoothly, lasts all day and vanishes on my skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything. It doesn&#x27;t heal or provide coverage. It doesn&#x27;t even smell like it actually contains any sulfur. Bare Minerals sulfur treatment far surpasses this stuff.</li>
    <li> It has an odd smell (I didn&#x27;t mind the bare minerals scent at all), is much lighter than bare minerals, and just doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well. I used my bare minerals blemish therapy often but I haven&#x27;t touched this stuff since the first week I got it. Wish I returned it.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 of these, one for me and the rest for my grandkids. Had a nasty bump that broke out on my face and it was almost gone by the 3rd day, with no picking.dried it up nicely. It should last for quite a while.</li>
    <li> Covered everything perfectly. I usually use Bare Minerals (which is also good), but my monthly budget could not afford it this time. I expected a cheap replacement, &amp; some disappointment...NOPE!! I still like my original brand, but for half the price &amp; same quality, I have changed a couple products.</li>
    <li> This product absolutely deserves more positive reviews. I use it as a spot treatment/concealer after using my foundation and it instantly soothes and covers redness. My pimples take less than a day to go away. And for the price? It&#x27;s amazing! Sometimes I use this with a powder brush and dust it lightly over my whole face before bed to help any clogged pores go away.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a bareMinerals Blemish Therapy replacement, please do not waste your hard earned cash.  I know the price is alluring, but bareMinerals is superior.  I love bareMinerals and had high hopes for this product, but it did not dry out my blemishes or reduce inflammation.  Just bite-the-bullet and spend the extra for bareMinerals.  Also, I do not work for bM, and they are not paying me to write this.  I am just a long time user of Blemish Therapy and will continue to use as long as it works.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend ordering this brand of blemish powder, especially if you are looking for an alternative to the BareMinerals blemish therapy. The latter actually works and it works well, however, the company&#x27;s blatant reduction in product while keeping same price was absurd so I bought this product as an alternative. Here&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t like this Elf powder: the powder didn&#x27;t come out very easily, the container itself felt very low quality and was not exactly effortless in its design, but most importantly, the powder did not absorb well into the brush or into my skin. I had more than a couple of places of moderate-severe acne at the time. This was useless to me. It didn&#x27;t blend into my skin, so it just sat on top of the spots I was trying to reduce and coverup-making them look more noticeable and made me feel worse about my skin. I actually sent this back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe for the fair-skinned person who gets the occasional pimple, this would be ok. If you have moderate acne, consider shelling out the $ for the bareminerals kind, but honestly, I find myself happy using a homemade remedy- aloe vera and dead sea salt dissolved in distilled water. When combined, this seems to reduce the size and redness enough to allow my regular bb cream can do a decent job covering up.  If you like less products in your life and don&#x27;t love cosmetics, that might be worth a try. Acne sucks.</li>
    <li> I ordered this with high hopes. The box was crushed and there was no brush. Aside from that, the product itself it great. I have cystic acne and this mineral blemish powder( along with the Aztec mud mask) I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my skin and I really was a critic, having tried everything in my 35 yrs. It works, buuuuuut seriously, where&#x27;s my brush?</li>
    <li> My wife has oily skin and loves this stuff, wishes she could get it from a store.  Has stuff in it to help with acne. goes on without a mask effect, so she tells me :)</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed a while back when Bare Minerals cut back the size of their Blemish Treatment sulfur powder dramatically without changing the price, more than doubling the per-ounce cost. I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement ever since and I think I found it! This product is great. It&#x27;s 3% sulfur, same as the Bare Minerals product and works just as well. I wear this underneath makeup every day and even use it on days when I don&#x27;t want to wear makeup, but still want to look nice. I am very pale, so I can get away with wearing this on its own well. Fantastic product- I am so glad that I found it!</li>
    <li> This has really helped clear up some acne and hides blemishes well!</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t many kits that can conceal and treat blemishes. This one does both, the color is bright enough that you don&#x27;t look like you painted over a blemish. This brightens the area, and treats the underlying cause. I&#x27;m thrilled with it so far.</li>
    <li> Have used e.l.f. Mineral Blemish Kit for couple years, works wonderful.</li>
    <li> Mature skin, but cystic breakouts break my heart.  This powder works so well - the horrible red bumps dry out quickly with no picking.</li>
