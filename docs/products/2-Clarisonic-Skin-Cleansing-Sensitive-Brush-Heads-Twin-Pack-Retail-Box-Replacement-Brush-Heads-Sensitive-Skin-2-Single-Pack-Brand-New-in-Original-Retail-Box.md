<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Item was as described.  I&#x27;ve used the brushes and they are definitely real Clarisonic brushes.  They arrived in the original box.&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping and perfectly adequate packing.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These are the same as the original brush that came with my wife&#x27;s Clarisonic. These are not some second rate off brand brushes. They are made by Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> Got these to replace my original Clarisonic head. Great price and came in the original Clarisonic box. They are perfect.</li>
    <li> They are great - but not long after I bought them my Clarisonic died on my and I&#x27;m not going to spend over a $100 every two years because they don&#x27;t charge forever.  But I use the brushes manually and I&#x27;m guessing they do just as good a job.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are perfect for my sensitive, acne prone skin. I tried using the acne brush heads but they were too harsh for my skin. I have been using these heads for almost three years now. Amazon seems to be the best price for the heads too.</li>
    <li> Really good product, I am pleased that it&#x27;s not a cheap knock off like some of the other brushes reviewers have commented on.</li>
    <li> The brush heads are just what I hoped for: gentle tingling as my face is cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;The brush  head cleans easily with cleansing cream or moisturizing soap.&lt;br /&gt;I always leave the brush off of my Mia so that both pieces dry naturally!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is never irritated, as long as I use &#x27;sensitive&#x27;!</li>
    <li> These brushes are totally fake and feel really rough on the skin. They feel nothing like the real brushes. Don&#x27;t trust all the reviews saying they feel like the real deal. They are 100% fake. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    <li> After using these brushes my skin feels soft,subtle and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I had rough flaky skin from seborrheic dermatitis and this product was recommended by a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Great product! Thank you. It fits my MIA perfectly and the price is wonderful! I will never buy these at a regular retail store again.</li>
    <li> works well with clarisonic and came in fast</li>
    <li> This package of two is a bit expensive, but there are a real deal, it fit well with my brush. So I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I never realized how dirty my face was until I started to use Clarisonic.  The sensitive brushes are perfect for my sensitive skin.  I never thought I could be so pleased but I am.  Highly recommend if you want to bring that youthful look back to your skin.</li>
    <li> New heads to go with Mia 2.  So soft which is perfect for my sensitive skin yet it gets my face so clean.</li>
    <li> These are perfect and amazing, didn&#x27;t realize how gross mine was until the new ones came in the mail. Thank you</li>
    <li> (Used with Clarasonic Mia 2)  This product is faulty.  It does not vibrate or clean as it should.  Do not purchase.</li>
    <li> The real deal. Same packaging, same quality brush heads as ulta carries, but at a lot cheaper price. Fast delivery, would have reviewed them sooner but waited for the original one that came with my clarisonic to wear out.</li>
    <li> I am chinese....so my english is not well . ...Clarisonic  is sooooooooooo  much expensive in  China!!!  so ,I  very  like this product！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！Do not know if you can understand my English?  hahahahahhahha ·~~~~</li>
    <li> I ordered the clarisonic skin cleansing sensitive brush heads twin pack, but after I used it, I noticed the paper inside the box said DEEP PORE CLEANING BRUSH.  This is very disappointing.  I always purchase my replacement heads on Amazon and always get the sensitive brush heads.  My skin can be very sensitive and I would never have bought the deep pore brush heads.  Boo</li>
    <li> What a difference! Clarisonic has really helped my face (and neck area) look younger, brighter. And my face feels great afterwards, my pores have gotten smaller over time using this product. I always use the brushes for sensitive skin - works wonders!</li>
    <li> The brushes are dirty. I wonder it is second hand or what.&lt;br /&gt;Some bristles were squashed even though they placed in the box.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy anything from this buyer again.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are just like the brush that come with my Clarisonic Mia. Great for sensitive skin, I would not buy any other kind or brush.</li>
    <li> I bought the clarisonic about 6 months ago but the regular head didn&#x27;t work for my skin.  This one is perfect.  My skin is very sensitive (slight Roseacea)- the whole bit.  My skin definitely looks and feels cleaner and softer (I have been using these for about 4-5 days now)- it definitely makes a difference.</li>
    <li> These brush heads gave me a bumpy red rash on my face. VERY HARSH. (It took me a while to realize it was the brush heads and not an allergic reaction to something else!) I ended up tossing them both. Do not buy these. Prior to ordering these, I&#x27;d used genuine Clarisonic brush heads for years--I loved them and never had any problems. These brush heads are an inauthentic and potentially dangerous product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to buy this. It took a little longer to get than most Amazon orders but this seller saved me big time. The brush heads are of very good quality and I am so happy to have gotten them at such an amazing price. Great deal</li>
    <li> I purchased the two pack of sensitive brush heads, but there is a noticeable difference between the brush heads I ordered on amazon and the original brush head that came with my mia.  The amazon brush heads have softer bristles and appears to be slightly different.</li>
    <li> i found it very effective and i also have recommended to others to get more benefit out of it. Keep it up</li>
    <li> They feel rougher than the regular brush heads do. These feel feel more scratchy than the the regular brush heads do.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads retail for  $25 each.  I got a much better deal on Amazon.  And of course I love the Clarasonic!  I can&#x27;t imagine going back to washing my face by hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone from the deep pour, to the acne brush, to this one.&lt;br /&gt;Over-all in the long term, the sensitive brush head is much better for me.&lt;br /&gt;You certainly need to replace every 3 months and remember not to press the bristle so hard on your face.&lt;br /&gt;You almost have to gently, barely touch the brush to your face for maximize the cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who does not have a Clairsonic should buy one.&lt;br /&gt;Try different brushes andtest things out!</li>
    <li> even though the box says Clarisonic and the brushes look exactly like them, this must have been a bad batch of brush heads, they where harsh to the touch and to my skin on my face.. i used them once and threw them away. no wonder they where cheap, I gave in and went to Macy&#x27;s and bought them there and they where soft and great like before.  Never again will I buy online for something I can&#x27;t touch.. and i soon as i got them i compared the feel to my old ones and could tell they are not the same for whatever reason that might be....</li>
    <li> I paid a lot less for these than I would have paid at Sephora or Ulta and they&#x27;re exactly the same.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this purchase, I had been looking for the replacement brushes at different department stores, and was not happy with the price.  I will definitely continue to order these online.</li>
    <li> Seems to work ok.  But not holding up as well as original one that came with my Mia .  Did come in a box, though</li>
    <li> Item acts and looks real. I&#x27;d say this was a very good purchase considering how much these brush heads usually are at name brand stores such as Ulta. I recommend purchasing these. Good deal.</li>
    <li> Excellent Brush Heads!!  I have less or no break outs when I use these Claisonic sensitive brush heads. My skin is Not really sensitive, yet these brush heads feel good. I like the texture and softer skin. I feel better saturation of my creams and serums when I use this item. In My Opinion; Others are Not Equal, the Less Expensive brands are also Cheaper, as in Cheap, with inferior technology. I bring mine everywhere I go. It easily fits inside my luggage. I feel a huge difference when I don&#x27;t bring it on trips or don&#x27;t use it at home. These heads are Long lasting easy to change out. I Remove mine after Every use to rinse out the back of the Head &amp; inside base then let them air dry. The Base &amp; Heads Look New &amp; don&#x27;t get Soap Scum Build Up from my Cleansers. I Never need to Scrub any areas of the Heads or base unit. Use it on One side of Your Face, One Arm &amp; One side of Your Back/ Body, with Nothing on the Other Half, go through the Day &amp; You&#x27;ll Never go without it again!! There Truly is an Amazing Difference!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 08-27-13</li>
    <li> Ordered this to replace my worn clarisonic sensitive brush head. Put one on and the machine buzzed but the brush did not rotate! Tried the second brush and same thing. Plus the second brush said for Deep Pore Cleansing instead of Sensitive on the box. Looks like the real deal, but it cannot be, cuz ordered another brush direct from Clarisonic and lo and behold, works like a dream!!&lt;br /&gt;Be warned and beware, this is a dud!</li>
    <li> I was so worried for nothing.  Came before promised or expected.  Very happy.  Everything was excellent, would and hope to purchase from this site again.</li>
    <li> These brushes are legit made from Clarisonic. The price was decent and it came in two. I use my clearisonic on my face daily and every other night. Love it and makes my skin smooth. Removed most of all my makeup and most importantly it wasn&#x27;t too rough on my skin and my moisturizer soaked in nicely. Will buy from vendor/supplier again.</li>
    <li> Fits and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Original sensitive skin brush heads. Compatible with my original Mia. They are soft enough not to irritate my skin, but not too soft to a point where it doesn&#x27;t clean it. Great purchase!!!</li>
    <li> Easy way to order and get quickly at good price? Have been using clarisonic for 3 years and very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased a Clarisonic scrubber more than a year ago and she uses this every day.  The problem is that the replacement brush heads are expensive at the big brand retail stores.  Good value for this product.</li>
    <li> Great price &amp; everything! Been using my Clarisonic Pro for 3 years &amp; can&#x27;t say a bad thing about it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this tool for several years now at the recommendation of my esthetician.  The brushes need to be replaced periodically.  In between, I clean them with my ultrasonic cleaner used for jewelry, etc.</li>
    <li> These are good replacements. I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t fit or that they would be different than what I already have, but they&#x27;re exactly the same. I plan to repeat my order when it comes time to replace them.</li>
    <li> foot still hurts-been wearing inserts.</li>
    <li> They fit my Mia. Not much else to say. They work. Do a better job than other, less expensive cleaning brush products out there which claim they are as good.</li>
    <li> Be Aware of these proclaimed authentic clarisonic products on amazon. They come in authentic appearing boxes and all but the brush heads do not fit properly. When they are securely fastened into the grooves, they do not vibrate.  The brush heads are also much rougher than the original one that came with the Mia2, which irritated my skin.  Don&#x27;t waste money to buy fake stuff, spend the extra few bucks to buy authentic product from a legitimate retailer.</li>
    <li> gift - giftee loved it&lt;br /&gt;has sensitive skin and this product allows her to actually feel she is cleaning her face</li>
    <li> These really did come in the retail box as stated in the description. I was worried as I read some reviews on Amazon with people saying they had received fake brush heads. These are the real deal.</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic cleaning brush is wonderful. Gets off dirt and makeup ordinary hand washing misses. It also helps stimulate blood flow to the face.</li>
    <li> I paid a fraction of the cost of the two clarisonic skin cleansing brush heads!!  i was so excited!  i&#x27;ve bought books and now the clarisonic skin brushes at an incredible discount.  i&#x27;ll always check here first, before buying retail.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes and my face looked really irritated. I finally made the connection the brush was too harsh, even though it was for sensitive skin.  I think the brushes are fakes and are too harsh.  Will have to buy new ones and throw these out!</li>
    <li> I specifically looked for, and ordered, a replacement brush that said it was a genuine Clarisonic.  This seller said the two-pack of brushes I ordered were genuine.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do know that the first brush of this set that I&#x27;ve used doesn&#x27;t spin consistently.  I can feel when I&#x27;m using it on my face, that sometimes the brushes are spinning, but other times it is NOT spinning.  I&#x27;m just rubbing a brush around on my face.  It&#x27;s vibrating, but not spinning.  When I watch it in motion, I can also tell it&#x27;s alternating between spinning and not spinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just get mad every time I use this.  Haven&#x27;t tried the second replacement brush yet.</li>
    <li> They last forever. never mind the three months that they recommend.  Super easy to clean, but they don&#x27;t need to be replaced so&lt;br /&gt;often.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Sensitive Brush Heads, and instead the packaging says Acne Cleansing. The old brush heads I have are originals that came with my Clarisonic. These replacement heads look slightly different, and the bristles have a different texture. Also - for the first time after starting to use my Clarisonic, I am getting break outs again. So clearly, these new brush heads are not as effective.</li>
    <li> My concern with price is if they were fakes. They came in original Clarsonic boxes just like you&#x27;d see at the store. Delivery was quick!</li>
    <li> Absolutely did not work on my Clarisonic. I brought the heads to a store in the mall to try them on another Clarisonic machine, they did not work there either - was told by the sales associate that this is happening to a lot of people buying these here. Same thing happened to my friend. If the price is too good to be true, then it probably is. What a rip-off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have been looking for the brush heads every where. They are very expensive when purchasing elsewhere!  Glad I found them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic brush set is top of the line. It&#x27;s probably in the top rankings in the market for similar products. The design is great and it&#x27;s durable and effective as well. I&#x27;ve used others in the past and even tried the Proactive brush but it wasn&#x27;t up to par with this. It&#x27;s really heavy and durable which to me is the biggest selling point. I tend to abuse my beauty items so if they can last, they get a vote from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are EXPENSIVE and so are the refills! For that reason I try to eliminate my need to use them as much as I possibly can. That means keeping my skin clean!! Tea tree oil is how I manage this- [[ASIN:B00I42CK4A 100% Pure Tea Tree Oil + FREE Acne Fighting Blemish Roll-on Stick with Tea Tree Oil]] Between that and a face scrub once a day, my pores get their insides cleaned plenty! Tea tree oil clears up existing acne or blemishes too, and quick. The brush is my emergency/big night out special use only treat!</li>
    <li> The bristles are very soft, and there were no issues putting them on. I was long overdue to replace my brush head, and it is a pleasure to use now!</li>
    <li> What a deal.  If you have seen these things on the Clarisonic website or in a retail store you know they are ridiculously expensive well this was the exact same thing, same box even that I saw last night in Belks and their twin back was $48.00.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Just like I received with my Clarasonic when I first got it. Fits perfectly and does a great job cleaning the skin. Would definately recommend..</li>
    <li> These cleansing heads arrived the day after I ordered them!  Amazing!  Very fast shipping and they arrive in tiny plastic bags inside the clairsonic box.  From what I can tell they appear to be the original heads and not a duplicated.  They fit my Mia2 no problem and I will order from this place again.</li>
    <li> The Mia 2 is the machine I bought to use these heads on.  I purchased one for me &amp; one for my daughter for her birthday.&lt;br /&gt;We both love the machine.  It gives your face a healthy glow.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I order these brushes recently and it wasn&#x27;t worth the money. I used it in the morning and in the evening for two days, the bristles looked like i was using it for a month. I through it in the trash! I then ordered my replacement brushes from Clarisonic, it was about the same price too. Sometimes you just have to get burn to learn.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this, if she is happy, I am happy.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews for these brushes, which made me concerned.  These are real and from clarisonic.  I am Very happy with them.</li>
    <li> Seems authentic. Compared it to the original sensitive brush head that came with my Mia 2 when I bought it... The plastic base seems a bit off in color other than that its almost identical. Came with the box and instruction manual inside as well as a protective cover for each brush. What a great deal!</li>
