    <li> Theyre beautiful and strong enough to keep in place for the most unruly hair.</li>
    <li> The picture makes them look bigger than they really are. When they say &amp;#34;Mini&#x27; they mean it, 1&amp;#34; high, 1&amp;#34; wide</li>
    <li> Long thick heavy hair and these are great!</li>
    <li> a little smaller than I thought, so hard to get around my pony tail</li>
