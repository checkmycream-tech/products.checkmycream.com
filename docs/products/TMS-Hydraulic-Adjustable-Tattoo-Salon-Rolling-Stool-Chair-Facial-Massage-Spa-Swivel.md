    <li> Very easy to put together.  Very light also to carry around, as I have a mobile massage therapy business.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this stool in my kitchen so I can sit while preparing veggies, washing dishes, etc.  The stool is perfect.  Height is easily adjustable and the wheels work well.  I can sit and roll from the counter to the sink to the &#x27;fridge.</li>
    <li> Quality of chair met my expectation.  The frame and wheels are sturdier then other models.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but every time I move, it sounds like it&#x27;s breaking.  Hasn&#x27;t broken and I think the issue is in the seat somewhere.  Maybe it&#x27;s just mine.  It was easy to put together and is very comfortable on my toosh.</li>
    <li> After first use the hydraulics bottomed out and kept lowering everytime I sat on it&lt;br /&gt;They sent me a replacement bar but after beating the chair with a rubber mallet for several minutes, I realized the bar was not going to come back out. So Im stuck with a dented chair that doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I only used this a couple of times and then the hydraulics went out on it. It will not stay elevated  when any weight at all is put on it and is very short when it is in the lowest position, therefore useless.</li>
    <li> 13.5&#x27;&#x27; diameter cushion too small with backing that&#x27;s so weak it flexes when you sit on it, so if you were to lean back you almost fall over. Im 6&#x27; 185lbs, Castors don&#x27;t roll smooth at all (Similar to castors used in cheap plastic drawers you get at walmart). Invest more on another chair.</li>
    <li> Great sellers and products.</li>
    <li> Thin padding, very wobbling and the base is aluminum which bends and dents very easily.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> works fine, everything is snap together so easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this chair. I only used it a few times and the hydraulics stopped working. I will be sending this chair back!</li>
    <li> Great sturdy stools.. Bought four and lovem</li>
    <li> This stool is very comfortable, and adjustable (height). Perfect for me to perform Chiropractic adjustments. Everything works as expected and the assembly took less than 1 min. If you have a high body weight, it may be uncomfortable. I strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great stool for great price</li>
    <li> a bit noisy when rolling otherwise its good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this stool.  It seems to be very well made, it&#x27;s comfortable to sit on for long periods and it hasn&#x27;t had any problems holding up my 260 pounds!  Was easy to assemble and so far seems to be a great bargain.</li>
    <li> Hydraulic broke in one week</li>
    <li> Considering its fragile/light built look -its well made for the affordable price ,and as an artist I&#x27;m always looking for some multiuse .&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this BARBER chair (as it printed on its original company box) for/as:&lt;br /&gt;1. as a leg rest support for my long-back office chair.&lt;br /&gt;2. when I paint I need to stand up too often,so it helps allot.&lt;br /&gt;3. I even use while i&#x27;m cooking (adjustable highs/lows really helps in all situations.&lt;br /&gt;4. I think this is the only chair on the market, that I can actually put on the floor without wheels and it will stay steady (all 5 legs touch the floor )&lt;br /&gt;Most will not stay on the surface without wheels ,coz of the pneumatic tube on its way.&lt;br /&gt;Its so light weight I can move it around without prob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. I deducted one star for the cheap aluminum alloy ; too much of magnesium very little aluminum so it makes base porous and breakable &amp; it will stain,&lt;br /&gt;2. If it will be dropped on cement or any hard surface.&lt;br /&gt;3. ii&#x27;s just cosmetic; vinyl hand-stapled to to wooden base seat. I&#x27;m not sure about longevity of this product, but for this price you pay &amp; considering what I stated above its a still. I recommend it. Its comfortable not to soft or too hard.</li>
    <li> Great stool for the price. Cushion not very thck. But i didnt use the cushion anyways. I bought a roc an soc cushion and retrofitted it to the base. Works awesome. And cheaper too!</li>
    <li> Hydraulic&#x27;s stopped working after 4 uses</li>
    <li> Great little stool, just what I wanted, thank you.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what was described and exactly what I needed.</li>
