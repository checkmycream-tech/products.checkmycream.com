### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The handle is not the best but considering the price.</li>
      <li>The best for the buck!!!!!</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great service.</li>
      <li>Great price</li>
      <li>Brush works up a good lather and works as it should.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for beginners</li>
      <li>Thanks for a great brush at a great price!</li>
      <li>It holds water well, whips up nice and feels good going on.  </li>
      <li>After ordering this one it performs great, and leaves me with a perfectly smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Otherwise a nice inexpensive brush.</li>
      <li>These brushes make a nice creamy lather and should do well.  </li>
      <li>It feels great on the face, and it stirs up plenty of lather provided you use true shaving soap.</li>
      <li>Nice grip, well constructed, and has lasted through many shaves.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a brush that you can use and own for more than a week just do yourself a favor and spend the money on something that is worthwhile.</li>
      <li>This fells a lot better than pig hair, on my face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this brush.  </li>
      <li>Bristles are ok.</li>
      <li>Badger is better than boar.  </li>
      <li>The brush arrived in fine shape.</li>
      <li>If you are looking to waste money on a brush that you can use for a weekend and look forward to losing this is the perfect purchase.</li>
      <li>Fantastic brush.</li>
      <li>I have been using shave brushes all my life and this brush holds water great is just firm enough to build a good lather and lift whiskers....</li>
      <li>highly recommend this to anyone who wants to experience an amazing, quality shave.</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for though, this is worth the money if you need a quick fix.</li>
      <li>Really, as someone who has been wet shaving for 5 years now and buying quality shaving gear these brushes make excellent gifts for the many friends I try to turn on to wet shaving.</li>
      <li>And as far as the free gift...</li>
      <li>I found this one for his Christmas stocking, and it was exactly what he wanted.  </li>
      <li>It is very brushy-like</li>
      <li>I have used it for the past week and have been very satisfied with how it does its job.  </li>
      <li>But I didn&#x27;t expect a whole lot for $8.</li>
      <li>Decent brush.</li>
      <li>Deducted one star because it seems to shed on a pretty regular basis.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this product simply because I have received much better brushes from other purchases.</li>
      <li>Kinda cheap, the handle is not solid, rather a hollow plastic.</li>
      <li>brush will be a boar brush, this one is too soft.  </li>
      <li>I ended up purchasing a more expensive quality brush which I should have done in the first place.</li>
      <li>and I might buy a new one in 3 or 4 years when this one wears out, maybe earlier if it wears quicker.</li>
      <li>However, once that wore off, he stated he will not use anything else and will be purchasing another brush similar to this one (if not the same one) when he needs a new one.  </li>
      <li>It is not a high end device but who wants to spend big $$$ on a shaving brush anyway.  </li>
      <li>He can&#x27;t get over the softness of the bristles, although he did have to get used to the smell the first few days.  </li>

<li> I would recommend to anyone either as a wet shave noob or someone who has been at it for a long time.</li>
<li> Minimally...</li>
<li> I threw it away because it was shedding hair worse than a typical middle aged man.</li>
<li> Plastic handle is a little cheapish but as I said, it does the job and does it well.  </li>
<li> It was the plain envelope it arrived in.</li>
<li> Bit flimsy, but it works for a beginner, hard to beat the price.</li>
<li> It sheds worse than my Siberian Huskies.</li>
<li> I was disappointed by the quality and look of the handle.</li>

    <li> Decent brush. I was disappointed by the quality and look of the handle.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a badger hair shaving brush for the last several weeks at retail stores and they are an arm and a leg! After ordering this one it performs great, and leaves me with a perfectly smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to experience an amazing, quality shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for beginners</li>
    <li> All in all I&#x27;m pleased with this brush.  The hair doesn&#x27;t come out like I&#x27;ve seen with other brushes, I think only one in a week of use.  It holds water well, whips up nice and feels good going on.  It is not a high end device but who wants to spend big $$$ on a shaving brush anyway.  Plastic handle is a little cheapish but as I said, it does the job and does it well.  I would recommend to anyone either as a wet shave noob or someone who has been at it for a long time.</li>
    <li> Does this brush work? Minimally... It sheds worse than my Siberian Huskies. And as far as the free gift... It was the plain envelope it arrived in. The brush was not properly packaged and the lack of care showed. It was just put in a packaging envelope that allowed it to be beat up and misshapen from the start. I would not recommend this product simply because I have received much better brushes from other purchases. If you are looking to waste money on a brush that you can use for a weekend and look forward to losing this is the perfect purchase. If you are looking for a brush that you can use and own for more than a week just do yourself a favor and spend the money on something that is worthwhile.</li>

    <li> Started shedding from day one. You get what you pay for though, this is worth the money if you need a quick fix.</li>
    <li> Nice grip, well constructed, and has lasted through many shaves. It feels great on the face, and it stirs up plenty of lather provided you use true shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush. I have been using shave brushes all my life and this brush holds water great is just firm enough to build a good lather and lift whiskers.... The best for the buck!!!!!</li>
    <li> After six months of usage, it sheds.  It looses about three dozen hairs per shave.  They get stuck in the razor and who knows what they are doing to the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next brush will be a boar brush, this one is too soft.  But I knew that when I bought it.</li>
    <li> Really, as someone who has been wet shaving for 5 years now and buying quality shaving gear these brushes make excellent gifts for the many friends I try to turn on to wet shaving. Badger is better than boar.  These brushes make a nice creamy lather and should do well.  The handle is not the best but considering the price. 5 star starter brushes.</li>
