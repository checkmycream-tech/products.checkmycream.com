    <li> This masque is wonderful - it will leave your hair so soft, shiny and healthy! I use this product once every 2-3 weeks and it makes my hair feel wonderful! The only issue I have is that it can tend to weigh my hair down so I try to make sure I use it on a day where I&#x27;m looking for a volumized style. It&#x27;s a great product to have in your beauty toolbelt!</li>
    <li> I have tried alot of conditioners and masque and this is by far one of my favorites.  Leaves hair very soft and helps color from fading as fast.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> This product has a great deal for a super fair price; My wife loved the product and the delivery was very quick, and is recommended for all those who want a quality treatment in their hair;</li>

    <li> Fantastic hair treatment.  I typically use this product once/twice a week and it leaves my hair silky smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Love love this product when paired with Kerastase Chroma Riche shampoo. My hair is very porous and for years Ive struggled with finding the right product. Not no more. It is what I consider expensive but On the same note I only was my hair every 4-5 days now where  in the past I felt I needed to wash it daily. It seems like it penetrates into the hair and my hair Is at its best on day 2-3. I won&#x27;t go back to another brand again. I tried to go cheaper a few times since discovering this product but its not worth it to me .</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Does not weigh down your hair and rinses clean.  Very easy to open in the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, never have I been so disappointed. The container was not sealed and the inner top cover was missing. I suspect it&#x27;s been tampered with. It does not smell the same nor does it leave my hair as I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to -it leaves a waxy film on it. I would had returned it if it wasn&#x27;t for the hassle of returning it. I will continue to use this product but I will never purchase from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it!  It&#x27;s so thick and makes my hair thicker and less straw-like, as it&#x27;s color damaged.</li>
    <li> Awesome conditioner. Dont need much, just enough to moisten hair but focus on ends. If you put too much then it can weigh hair down. Worth the price. Think of it as concentrated conditioner. Great for super tangled hair or dry hair.</li>
    <li> This masque has changed my hair. I live in South Florida and it helps keep my hair frizz-free and healthy in the humid weather.</li>
    <li> I like this product, as it was recomment to me by my hairstylist.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad it is available online, it saves me money and buying larger size, it last longer before I have to buy again.</li>
    <li> Hair shows results rapidly, leaving hair very soft, and healthy looking. This masque protects hair when you are outdoor.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but love it!</li>
    <li> The real deal here. Will shop here again. There is some fear coursing through me each time I make an online purchase of something that&#x27;s this expensive but this company is legitimate.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair that tangles easily. This conditioner moisturizes my hair and allows me to easily comb my hair out in the shower. If you have dry, damaged and/or color-treated hair, this is for you.</li>
    <li> I ordered Kerastase Chroma Riche Masque 16.9 oz. and I received a different product when my order arrived.  I did not want to bother with trying to return it for the correct product, so I kept it but I am not happy about this.  I will order from a different vendor in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Kerastase products in the past and have been happy with the purchase. This product does not compare. The texture and smell are quite different and my hair does not react the same. I am a bit hesitant buying shampoo in the future.</li>
    <li> Me encanto, excelente el tiempo de entrega fue realmente rapido fue lo q esperaba ..muy agradecida por la rapidez del servicio</li>
    <li> I love this masque. I&#x27;ve been using these products  for about 10 years now, I used to have to change  because my hair would get too used to one product. This changed the thickness and condition of my hair! I use almost 1 product from each line. Not all, but, I need 1 for color, damage. Thickness. I recommend highly</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair shines after using this conditioner.  It is a wonderful hair treatment for dry hair.</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes a huge difference in hair health, shine, and texture. I now use many products in this line and they do exactly what they promise. Expensive, but worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Makes my hair feel alive.</li>
