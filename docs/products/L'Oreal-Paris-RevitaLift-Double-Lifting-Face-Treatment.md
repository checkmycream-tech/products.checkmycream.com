      <li>I really liked every thing about it,</li>
      <li>I really want to thank L&#x27;Oreal for this wonderful cream, my face was cover with wrinckles, I used this cream, twice a day</li>

      <li>Very easy.</li>
      <li>I saw a review of this on D. Oz with a plastic surgeon, who recommended it, I have been using it since, and it really smooth&#x27;s out the skin, the lines diminish and it feels good on your skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a skeptic when it comes to any kind of skin creams that are supposed to work magic on my 60-year-old face.  </li>

      <li>Will let you know more after I have used it longer.</li>
      <li>I tried to in the beginning, but should have known myself better.  </li>
      <li>I love the way this goes on, I should have gotten black/brown.</li>
      <li>4 more words huh.</li>
      <li>THIS IS THE NEXT BEST THING TO BOTOX!  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Love this product, does everything it says it does...</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure your mileage may vary,</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did not see results, even minor.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Loreal Revitalift products and they work as well or better than more expensive department store brands.</li>
    <li> feels good and refresh and i feel the lift work and i will buy it again for the cost is good</li>
    <li> Great great product.  Smells lovely too and love how it feels so great on my neck and face.</li>
    <li> My mom swears by this product. She is over eighty years old  yet people think she is still in her sixties. I guess that&#x27;s a good testimonial.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay products for over 30 years but have always been disappointed in their eye creams.  L&#x27;Oreal makes a much better eye product.  It really helps reduce lines and puffiness.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 5 years and it continues to work!</li>
    <li> Good for summer, but don&#x27;t work on eyes, so eye cream is required.  Works nice on throat too.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really want to thank L&#x27;Oreal for this wonderful cream, my face was cover with wrinckles, I used this cream, twice a day and I can see the diffference. My face looks younger, healthy and not much of wrinkles. Thank you again.  Yes, I&#x27;ll keep on using it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works very good,  Firms and tightens the skin soon after you start using it.  Very moisturizing. Good fit for mature skin..</li>
    <li> It is a nice lotion, but that is it.  So you are paying a high price for just plain old lotion.  I must admit, however, that I am not real good about using this as a regular regimen.  I tried to in the beginning, but should have known myself better.  I still don&#x27;t think it would have done the miracles I wanted.  If it was what I was hoping, everyone would have been screaming from the roof tops....hopefully I remember this for next time.  :)</li>
    <li> I think this product is fantastic for the price. I didn&#x27;t think I needed &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; and things like that as a guy, but this product seriously works well &amp; doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  My skin looks and feels great.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I love the way this feels and I can tell a little bit of difference but not a lot.  I think that when this runs out I will be trying something else.</li>
    <li> These items are very good.I would recommend them for anyone with non-oily skin.(I really don&#x27;t know about oily skin.  Also the service is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Double Lifting Cream after considerable research, which convinced me that retin A and peptides are the two preferred products for building collagen and elastin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often rely on Amazon&#x27;s reviews.  However, many of the reviews on beauty products are obviously written by their manufacturers.  Still, I was impressed with this product&#x27;s ingredients - especially at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave Double Lifting a try \\&quot;despite\\&quot; the glowing reviews about an immediate lift by some reviewers; and I am quite prepared to try this product for 8 weeks.  But what a surprise.  I have used this product three times, and each time, I have noticed an immediate lift.  I might add that the lift was significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say how long the lift lasts.  I didn&#x27;t try to clock it or even determine whether it continues overnight.  But it certainly exists in my case.  (I&#x27;m a good person to draw this conclusion - since I have spent many, many hours learning to exercise the individual muscles in my face.  If anyone knows each wrinkle and crevice of her face, I do.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the \\&quot;lift\\&quot; will only be temporary. Perhaps the product will cease to have an immediate impact when I apply it later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say.  Nonetheless, I do like the ingredients in Double Lifting  -  so much so that I am removing another, more expensive product from my daily regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An immediate lift?  How in the world is this possible?</li>
    <li> I order L&#x27;Oreal RevitaLift I am 59 My skin isn&#x27;t to bad with wrinkles some brown spots. I really didn&#x27;t see to much of a change. It smells nice and is like most other produts. The price was good.</li>
    <li> Have used it for a month, following the directions to the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;, no change whatsoever in my eye bags and crows feet. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> so far so good, i like the dual mixture. i like the feeling on my face, but i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s doing anything....hmmm</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this by mistake. I thought it was the double lifting eye cream with two creams in one pump.  The red cream goes on your upper lid and the white cream goes under your eyes. I&#x27;ve been using that product on my eyes for years with great results and that&#x27;s what I thought I was ordering when I ordered this. When the package arrived and I realized this was basically the same thing I had been using for my eyes but that they had created it for a face cream, I was actually happy I had made the mistake. I tried it and I get the same results for my face that I had been for my eyes. I immediately ordered a second bottle (I always stock up on the cosmetics I can&#x27;t live without). It definitely rejuvenates skin and tightens it. I can feel it working the second I put it on. I am 38 years old and I still get carded for alcohol and no one can believe my real age when I tell them. I think a lot of it has to do with the creams I use, and this one is now a favorite.</li>
    <li> have been using this product for 2 months and have noticed dramatic difference in skin texture, tone and vitality. Department store pricing is $19- $27  so the savings through Amazon,makes it even better!</li>
    <li> This is not a wonder drug or miracle drug.  However, it does deliver some really good results.  It minimizes wrinkles, not the Grand Canyon type, but normal aging wrinkles and it does seem to firm up the facial skin and well as even out skin tone.</li>
    <li> The white lotion stopped getting out after several uses.  And I can not return it because the return window is already closed.  Waste money.</li>
    <li> GREAT SELLER, DOESNT WORK THOUGH AS PROMOTED</li>
    <li> It feels great on my skin! 2 in 1 lotion is great....saving time and money! Good price and product! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Started using this less than a month ago and it is great.  I am 68 years old went to a new  doctors office last week and he thought he had the wrong chart.  He said I look no where  near 68 years old.  Thank you L&#x27;Oreal</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t lift anything,and didn&#x27;t do anything that baby oil or anything else would have.  There are other L&#x27;Oreal products that I like much better than this one.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how many products I have tried ... and this is the first I would give a 5 star rating to. I have only used this 1 week and am absolutely amazed at the visual difference. My turkey neck and I have been at odds for years and this has made such a difference I am amazed as well as I can see a difference in my face as well. To be honest my face has a few deep wrinkles but does not need the lift as much as my poor neck even though I am in my 60&#x27;s. This is an unbelievable winner in my book and have already recommended it to my sister as well as purchased a few other products in this line, and plan on trying at least one more. At drugstore prices no less... by the way I have spent a fortune on some products without any where close to these results ...</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and so far I notice a lovely hue to my skin.  I would recommend everyone to give it a try and I believe you will be very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I saw a review of this on D. Oz with a plastic surgeon, who recommended it, I have been using it since, and it really smooth&#x27;s out the skin, the lines diminish and it feels good on your skin.  it is cost effective also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months. It really does lift the neck and jowl area and make it appear smoother. It has a nice sent and is light and easy to absorb into the skin. For the money I doubt if you can find anything that works better than this one. I also like L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift for Eyes.</li>
    <li> I used it for months...finished second bottle...no noticeable difference at all. Some moisture...that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It really works exactly like it says I am 33 and am getting wrinkles around my eye and between the eye brows and now on my forehead this stuff took the fine lines AWAY and made the deep wrinkle in the corner. of my eyes look like fine lines. I look so much younger already not sure about the long term effect like if it takes wrinkles away over time as I have only used it twice but I am in love with this stuff I have been using Olay and never really say a difference and that was 40 bucks!!! I really do feel like I look younger and more pretty Oh also one more thing I would like to add when I put makeup on it would always make my wrinkles look worse with this glides right over over it and still can see any wrinkles. I am going to buy more :D</li>
    <li> I heard and read this was an incredible product, and was my first purchase of this type.  I have very few wrinkles or significant signs of aging, and saw absolutely no difference whatsoever in the small areas that could use a little bit of a \\&quot;lift\\&quot; or a plump.  The product also ran out too quickly for the amount I used in the amount of time, and I am suspicious that the container was not full when I received it -- or worse -- that it was substituted with another product.  Either way, I&#x27;m not buying this product again or any other from the seller I bought it from.</li>
    <li> very happy with this moisturizer.. Why spend more at the drug stores?&lt;br /&gt;Works well, feels nice and buy from Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have used L &#x27;Oreal products for years and I was very happy to find this product at such a great price.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer even for guys too. It does the job and the scent isn&#x27;t too heavy. It keeps your skin healthy.</li>
    <li> I am undergoing chemo treatments for breast cancer. Chemo is terrible for my skin, always dried out and my face was looking very old.  After the first couple of uses I saw that I looked better, less dry and less old. I use it twice a day and when I look at myself in the mirror at least now I don&#x27;t see an old looking face and no hair.  This products and my wigs help me to feel presentable again in my business.&lt;br /&gt;I have never seen a product that so many women agreed on, that is what made me try it.  I am very glad I did.</li>
    <li> I did not see any different it what it said it would improve after using all of it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I think it works to reduce wrinkles, as shown on Dr. Oz&#x27; show.  I&#x27;m a believer!  I use it ever day</li>
    <li> Return to sender right away if this product stings when applied to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Purchase in a cosmetic store for an easy return.</li>
    <li> I love Loreal anyway but this stuff is amazing.  It smells just like a product I received a sample of that cost ten times as much.  In just two days my skin is noticeably tighter and my wrinkles have lessened.  This really works and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> This product is simalar to the current moisturizer im using. Cant say I have seen any results but it has keep my skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Works fast! Put it on my over worked hands to really see, and the wrinkles and dry skin gone in seconds. Use on face and neck with vitamin C oil only. I wear no make-up. Turning 45 and have been told in the last week, that I barely look 35. I will take those compliments any day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be re-ordering&lt;br /&gt;YES as a gift!</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping to see some change maybe not right away but after a week or so..I saw nothing it is a good moisturizer that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I like the cream. I noticed a slight difference. Only issue I had was with dual dispenser. One ran out before the other.</li>
    <li> Okay so, im 16 and i did alot of tugging and stretching my face, but anyways it does work instantly, i use the red side more because i like the way it warms up, and i suggest you wash and exfoliate your face before you put this on, because it can seep into your face!</li>
    <li> Loved it! Thanks Dr. Oz, was the plastic surgeon on the show that gave the name! Saw the results really quick, really recommend!</li>
    <li> I love the way this goes on, I should have gotten black/brown. It goes really well. A little does really go a long way! Its a great deal for what you get.And its lasts all day! You can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> I am in my early 30s and have been using anti aging products since I was 25. I have always been using Olay anti aging eye creams and this is the first time I have used loreal. I must say I noticed some new fine lines under my eyes that were not there (or at least have not noticed) from when I was using Olay. Will probably go back to olay.</li>
    <li> The product arrived old and dried out. Shame on you for selling an old pasf</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do what was advertised to do no change in my skin. most L&#x27;Oreal products do a pretty good job and live up to expectations, not this one. I would not recommend</li>
    <li> maybe slight change after a month.Maybe longer use would have done the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t have such a strong fragrance :(( Estee Lauder still hasn&#x27;t caught on about heavily fragranced products. People don&#x27;t want perfume in their face creams!!!</li>
    <li> I had not been able to find the product in all of Las Vegas and thought it may have been discontinued. I gave been using but for years andcwasvrhrulledvto find it, needless to say ordered several. 5 star rhanks</li>
    <li> Used the entire bottle, saw no difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;It is gentle on your skin, doesn&#x27;t burn, which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;However like all of L&#x27;Oreal products it has a strong perfume smell that I hate.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a skeptic when it comes to any kind of skin creams that are supposed to work magic on my 60-year-old face.  I know that nothing is going to remove my wrinkles and make me look 10 years younger other than invasive surgical procedures so I have low expectations.  I am happy if my skin is soft, smooth, and blemish free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the RevitaLift Double Lifting Gel to replace my Miracle Blur and I like it even better.  It is a pump squirter that dispenses two different products, a red gel and a white cream.  Together they make my skin feel great -- soft and smooth.  I put it on underneath my foundation when I wear makeup, and by itself on days when I am not wearing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, nothing miraculous happened, but my skin is clean and soft, not dry and not oily.  I spend a lot of time in the sun during the summer so I have to pamper it a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product.</li>
    <li> After tring several other products, I decided to give loreal a try. I loves how it goes on my face, it almost feels cool as its going on and it does not feel oily when I put it on.</li>
    <li> I will be buying this again.The price is awesome too, considering I have wasted money on more expensive products in the past.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
    <li> it is just another cream</li>
    <li> This product is just another variation on the many moisturizers sold that promise miracles to people with aging skin - If you&#x27;re 35 (and don&#x27;t really need this product) you&#x27;ll probably like it because it&#x27;ll make you feel proactive about keeping your skin looking youthful. If you&#x27;re over 60, then you probably won&#x27;t be happy with the results.</li>
    <li> After just a few weeks I see a noticeable difference in my jawline, neck and chest. I am using this with a 0.5mm derma roller and several other RevitaLift products. I am very happy with the effectiveness of this product line.</li>
    <li> One of the bottles didnt work properly and only suspenced the white lotion</li>
    <li> This was really working out great until one side clogged up and I couldn&#x27;t get the lotion and the gel to &amp;#34;gel.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love this double lifting gel.  My skin looks amazing.</li>
    <li> I tried this, because it had good reviews and I found a very good price for it on Amazon.  I did like this stuff, and it seemed to work as well as any product can for smoothing wrinkles and firming skin.  But it does not last very long.  I used it on my face and neck.  I applied it liberally but not excessively, and it barely lasted a month.  I&#x27;ve found other products that last longer and seem to work as well in a comparable price range. But it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Only the white stuff comes out!  Where&#x27;s the red stuff?  Damn you, these wrinkles are proliferating!</li>
    <li> I have long used some of the most expensive skin care brands available as I work in cosmetics and had access to all the brands. In a rush to grab something before a trip I selected this and have been thrilled to find it does firm and moisturizer wonderfully! Imagine the savings being able to get fantastic moisture from a brand with this price. Very impressed and I have extremely dry skin and it is winter so to see this good a result is excellent.</li>
    <li> This smells good. Not overpowering.  I can&#x27;t say that I have noticed any difference since using it whatsoever, however.  Which seems to be the case with everything I try!</li>
    <li> Will buy again.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the way it dries in the two holes where the product dispenses out.  There should be a little lid to snap on it.  I hate separating the hard pieces when I use it.</li>
    <li> Love this product and I love that I can get on subscription and have it sent to the house on a regular basis.  Very easy.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling very smooth.</li>
    <li> For me personally I do not like it.  I am all Italian and have olive skin and break out somewhat easily. This product made me break out, therefore I wont be using it again. Going back to Clinique serum. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Very good product you can feel your skin lifting as soon as you apply it and I can see a improvement in my skins texture Thank you very much from Mary</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my face.  I could see positive results within 24 hours.  Each day I see a definite improvement!  I plan to buy the \\&quot;Deep Wrinkle Repair\\&quot; next!&lt;br /&gt;Linda Sutton</li>
    <li> I ordered this from a review from Dr. Oz. I really had no clue if it would really work. Well, it is amazing! I have been having compliments on how much younger I look. That makes me very happy to give it an excellent recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be sorry when you try this product.</li>
    <li> After Dr. Oz had a program about products that work for under $20, I decided to give this one a try. I&#x27;ve lost weight and I&#x27;ve got a little loose skin under the neck. This product really does the job! I&#x27;ve gone a day or two without it and notice the return of that wrinkled skin. After going back on this double-lifting gel I happily got back the nice results. The only problem with this is that since it&#x27;s actually two products pumped, I always seem to finish one side before the other. That&#x27;s the only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five.</li>
    <li> I was out of my normal product (health brand formula) that I used and the company was out of stock. I went to Walgreens and saw that this was on sale (for the price I just paid on Amazon) and decided to try it since I was in need. I was always skeptical about commercial products but L&#x27;Oreal has a good reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of creams for the under eye but there are so few creams dedicated to the eyelid area. I have been using this cream for over a month now and have seen a difference in the firmness of my upper eyelid as well as my under eye. I didn&#x27;t have much hooding but enough to be annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am now a L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Customer and I will continue to get it from Amazon because their regular price is the same as the sale price at Walgreens. Win, win, win :).</li>
    <li> me and the wife love it ..........every morning.............9/2014  allmost</li>
    <li> This product is the best that i have used and i have tried many different products. Makes my skin feel smooth and lifted and puts a glow back in my skin. I can tell when i do not use it and when i do. My complexion has improved a lot in the month that i have used it.</li>
    <li> read the reviews and thought i would try this but i did not see great results in 3 weeks of using so i went back to old faithful.  may work for someone else just not me</li>
    <li> I will be reordering Revitalift, This is by far one of the better products of this sort I have used.  I really liked every thing about it,</li>
    <li> I really like this.  It leaves my skin looking younger and has a matte finish.</li>
    <li> I was wondering if this would work, as yet i do not see any thing better at all. i won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the different L&#x27;Oreal Revita Lift cream for a long time and I like it.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Double lifting cream doesn&#x27;t work any better than the regular RevitalLift and it is half the size. The pump or shall I say pumps since it is a 2 part cream never did work properly. I had to use a stir stick to dig out the cream each time. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Love this product, does everything it says it does...now it doesn&#x27;t do it instantly but if you keep using the product, you can see the results!</li>
    <li> Saw this product recommended on the Dr. Oz show.  It is a wonderful product.  I saw overnight results and am now noticing long-lasting results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s effective and reasonable priced; one bottle lasts a month using 3x per week.) However, I have issues with the plastic dispenser.  In the beginning it worked, then after about 9 uses, the red chemical quit pumping. Only the moisturizer/tightener cream pumps now.  I just bought another bottle but kept my receipt in case I have the same problem with the next unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I wish they would \\&quot;think green\\&quot; and make a container that accommodates refill tubes. Considering the volume of sales L&#x27;Oreal does every month, think about how many plastic holders end up in the dump needlessly.</li>
    <li> When I tried to use this product, only one side of the gel opening would work. I tried everything to make it work, but in the end, I found that there was no gel on that side. I wouldn&#x27;t trust it to purchase again..</li>
    <li> Just like new only cheaper. I haven&#x27;t used this before cant tell you how it work.  4 more words huh.</li>
    <li> Excellent lifting gel. I use it for my chin area, and it makes a real difference. Great product.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my face everyday.  under my make up or just by itself.  It is a great product.</li>
    <li> Product felt really smooth and moisturizing.  Using the product nightly, it lasts about 1 1/2 months.  While it felt really good, I didn&#x27;t quick notice a real difference in the skin.  Pump makes it a little difficult to get all the product out of the bottle.  Not the best, but not the worse.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin</li>
    <li> Revitalift Double Lifting can make skin feel tighter temporarily because of the amount of alcohol and absorbent magnesium sodium silicate it contains, but that&#x27;s about drying up skin and causing irritation, which is actually wrinkle-inducing. There isn&#x27;t much else to extol in this gel, and calling it advanced must be L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s idea of sarcasm.</li>
    <li> I am 27 years old.  I have noticed some laugh lines forming around my mouth, the lines deepening from my noise to my mouth, and lines in between the brows (these are the worst).  Nothing serious, but I wanted to stop the little buggers in their tracks.  I used this product, in conjunction with [[ASIN:B000KONYPY L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced RevitaLift Complete Night Cream, 1.7 Ounce]], for 7 weeks and noticed no improvement in these lines.  While my skin is significantly softer to the touch, as far as wrinkles go, this product was a dud for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I also developed either some sort of acne or a rash while using this product, as I had small red bumps/marks form while I was using these products.  Approximately one week after discontinuing use of the Revitalift products, the bumps/marks stopped popping up.  Luckily they were easily covered with makeup, but on days I didn&#x27;t want to fix up, the marks were very noticeable.  I don&#x27;t have especially sensitive skin (other than that some jewelery turns my fingers green), so I was surprised this happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not re-purchase this product or the Night Cream from the same line, as it didn&#x27;t improve my wrinkles one bit and the red marks/bumps that arose during use were embarrassing when I wasn&#x27;t wearing makeup.</li>
    <li> It was okay. Not 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> Really?  Are you kidding me? In 3 days I SAW A DIFFERENCE!  I am over 60, have used EVERYTHING, used to buy my skin care in Europe, have spent hundreds on &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34;...and I am amazed!!!  This is truly an amazing product for an incredible price!</li>
    <li> works good for your skin, but if you have oily skin not as good.</li>
    <li> Definitely works to firm skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old busy busy mom. I started looking tired so a lady in her fiftys told me about this! I noticed results within two weeks. Tigher face....brighter eyes..... I love it! I plan on getting the night cream as well! Def important! Must have!</li>
    <li> Hard to say if this product works if you can&#x27;t get it tosquirt outof the container! There are 2 chambers that combine into one application but it just doesn&#x27;twork. What a waste oftime and money.If they can&#x27;t get something this basic right, I wonder about their product quality.</li>
    <li> works to moisterize and tighten, easy to apply , love the way the two types are separate or can use both combined</li>
    <li> What I expected. Convenient pump and over all quality of item was good. I would recommend to others. Thank you</li>
    <li> I am giving this product 2 stars for making my face feel a tad bit  firmer and it seems to have exfolitated somewhat and my skin appears less dull, but then again it could be wishful thinking and wanting to believe that it is working. I am almost finished with the tube only using it once a day. I may go to twice a day and see if there is any improvement. Nice smell, but not what I am hoping for. Will continue to look for that fountain of youth!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item many times from CVS.  The Amazon price is comparable. I started using it when it was recommended by a skin specialist on the Dr. Oz Show. I use many moisturizers, anti-aging products, masks, facial stimulating devices, cleansers, etc. I also use NuSkin Face Mask (Original Formula) which is amazing. I think this moisturizer is a good product. However, after using this for approximately 1 year, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than many other products out there---certainly not what I expected after hearing about it on Dr. Oz. In my opinion, the regular Revitalift is just as good. This product does not last very long and there is NOTHING double lifting about it. I believe I have had more success with the Loreal Youth Code products, both the moisturizer and the serum. I find the serum very similar to the Genifique Serum by Lancome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line--- nothing spectacular---none of these products will perform miracles! I believe that proper cleansing with a rotating brush twice a day, along with a daytime moisturizer with SPF protection and a heavier moisturizing night cream, after cleansing in the evening, will improve skin texture and minimize fine lines. The Loreal Youth Code or pricey Lancome Genifique Serums used along with this routine also seem to tighten and minimize sagging. However, IT IS IMPERATIVE to establish a routine and continue to use the products (whichever you choose) diligently twice a day. Like everything else in life, if  you put the time in, you get the results.</li>
    <li> I started using this two days ago and I am amazed at the difference my skin feels tighter and the wrinkles are much less noticeable</li>
    <li> It makes my wrinkles less noticeable and I seem to be gaining tightness in my throat.  Will let you know more after I have used it longer.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Good experience</li>
    <li> As the title says, I&#x27;m a 27 year old guy.  I was beginning to notice small wrinkles under my eyes and the lines on my forehead were beginning to become noticeable, so I decided I wanted to start treating them now instead of waiting until it was too late.  That being said, I&#x27;m only 27 so my wrinkles are very minimal and my skin overall is still probably fairly resilient.  I&#x27;ve had pretty awesome results with this stuff.  I&#x27;ve only used it for two weeks, but the lines under my eyes are completely gone.  The wrinkles on my forehead are not visible anymore, either.  Incredibly (and confusingly), for the first time in my life, I have dimples when I smile.  Not sure how that happened, but they&#x27;re there... never even had em when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure your mileage may vary, but this stuff worked really great with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  I just wanted to edit to say that the package is a little misleading.  There is really only about a months supply in the bottle (using a very small amount).  I&#x27;m not sure why the bottle needs to be so large.</li>
    <li> This worked pretty well for the money which was just a little. But I won&#x27;t buy it again because I like to use natural products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months now and find wonderful results!  Would highly recommend L&#x27;Oreal RevitaLift Double Lifting Gel..</li>
    <li> For the price and build up of positive feedback/ comments I read online before buying this item, I was very disappointed. I saw no results and was left with bad breakouts from using it. I have moved on to better more expensive organic products by origins from Sephora. Where I can also get a weeks sample of any product prior to purchasing!!! I found the zero oil by origins really works and got rid of the small acne bumps on my forehead that ive had for years,\ I also love modern friction scrub!!! I also use primer and mineral foundation powder from bare minerals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product its full of preservatives and chemicals.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and I do believe it is working, don&#x27;t expect a miracle, it&#x27;s not a face lift.  Since I think I have some benefit I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> notice a difference after using it for 2 weeks, will order more,  have been using loreal for several years and i love the line in general</li>
    <li> I wont&#x27; purchase this again.  It was OK and I didn&#x27;t really think it did much.  It was also hard to put on since a gel and lotion came out at once.  I do have the RevitaLift Double Eye Gel and I love that product.  It works better since I put the gel on my lid and the loiton under my eye.</li>
    <li> Okay, I was on the fence! BUT THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT! I got it because I have some saggy skin under my chin (I&#x27;m 30 but it was still always something I struggled with) within 4 uses it has already tightened up! WONDERFUL PRODUCT! Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> This product was just ok.  I didn&#x27;t notice it did anything bad to my skin but I also didn&#x27;t notice that it did anything good to it either, it was just another moisturizer.  Seller shipped product in a very timely manner and was well packaged</li>
    <li> i  could not tell a difference after using this product. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> You can buy this for 12 $ from Walmart, so I don&#x27;t believe that the real price is not 50$</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now and can clearly see the difference it has made.  I even can notice the difference if I forget to use it even one day.</li>
    <li> bought for friends as gift.  they like to use them. very good. Price is affortable as well.  will buy more next time.</li>
    <li> So far I have loved the feel of the moisturizer. Aging makes me much more aware of the wrinkles so I am glad there are qualitry products available to help us older ladies..</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE NEXT BEST THING TO BOTOX!  LOVE THIS CREAM!</li>
    <li> Tried this after I read an article that suggested it be used with anther product. Not a miracle in a bottle, but seems to work as described. I have seen a little lift here and there.</li>
    <li> I would like to know how many African American Women have tried this product and how effective or not effective it was for you. I am 40 years old, have very dry skin, no wrinkles but a lot of fine lines I would like to get rid of, and a little lift wouldn&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;ve tried many products and none have made a substantial difference. Are there any African American Women that can share their experience with this product?</li>
    <li> Purchased 3 of these at the same time. 2 of the 3 failed to open the white cream - despite numerous attempts, with taps,etc.  The 3rd worked perfectly and I really like it.  But will not buy again due to the package.</li>
    <li> Used it at a friend&#x27;s house and had to have it. So Cal girl in the sun a lot. Boyfriend likes the smell as well.</li>
    <li> I Purchased L&#x27;Oreal \\&quot;Revitalift Double Lifting Gel\\&quot; for my Mom and my Sisters. After six months my Sisters can&#x27;t tell the difference, my older Sister says that She has as many Wrinkles as She did before using the Cream, She couldn&#x27;t tell of any Changes. However, my Mom tells me that L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Double Lifting have made her face very Smooth and Nice and even got rid of some White Bumps or little Pimples She had for a while, and also added ...\\&quot;The Cream is Fabulous the Wrinkles get Smaller and all the Imperfections on the Skin are Disappearing\\&quot;...Well, there you have it, my Mom likes it and I believe everything my Mom tells me ...don&#x27;t You? ...Thank You D.D.</li>
    <li> love this product im 51 been using it for a couple of years,i also use other loreal products.a little goes a long way.I use it every morning and it usually last me a couple of months.</li>
    <li> A moisturizer that works awesome and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and two different creams. This gel can be gritty, especially the red part. It is to merge into one gel cream, but it didn&#x27;t help me.</li>
    <li> The cream went on nicely and smelt nice but I didn&#x27;t see any real results. Then again maybe it was a preventative measure, it has been a few years back when I did use this product and I didn&#x27;t have the wrinkles I do now. I have used other products in-between that time too. I have to face it that I am just getting old, haha. I think I am gonna start to make my own creams, its hard to know whats in anything these days and all the money we are wasting, from cheap to expensive!</li>
