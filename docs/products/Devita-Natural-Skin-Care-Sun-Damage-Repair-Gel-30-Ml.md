      <li>and im loving the compliments!</li>
      <li>I have fair freckled skin</li>
      <li>I attribute it to exercise and buying good products.</li>
      <li>I have also found this to give my skin exceptional clarity without breakouts.  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Still, I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product just once a day at night after my shower, and most of the sun spots and wrinkles are gone in just a month!</li>
      <li>this is nice stuff.  </li>
      <li>WOW is all I can say - best purchase!</li>
      <li>did not make me break out but the devita rejuvination seemed to work better on my wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>The even better part is the immediate reduction in color of brown spots.  </li>
      <li>I love Devita products; however, I have not noticed any reduction of my sun damage.</li>
      <li>Although I love this line, I do not like this product at all</li>
      <li>and I love how it feels.</li>
      <li>My skin looks healthy and lighter.</li>
      <li>The best part of this serum is the instant glow</li>
      <li>and I simply love how it soaks into my skin.  </li>
      <li>Most importantly, I just couldn&#x27;t tell that my skin improved at all from using it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m am overall happy I bought this.</li>
      <li>It does significantly reduce pigmentation.  </li>
      <li>To be honest I would probably had not bought this had i known that because my skin is very VERY sensitive and breaks out with any carrier oil.  </li>
      <li>At the end of each Summer, even with the use of sunscreen, I like to find something special to ramp my skin up and get it glowing for colder months.  </li>
      <li>you just have to find the right formulation!</li>
      <li>I appreciate that this product is made from natural ingredients, and it has a nice gel texture that absorbs well, with no grease or sticky residue.</li>
      <li>I use this twice a day with my night time usage being after I use my Clarisonic as it seems to make the delivery system even more intense.  </li>
      <li>This product is fast and easy to absorb.</li>
      <li>This miracle product does exactly what it says!</li>
      <li>This serum is so light and gentle that I can use it every night, including around my eyes, without any tacky residue.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased many brands of facial creams and products that contained empty promises, but not this serum it delivers great results.</li>
      <li>Guess it&#x27;s not great for traveling but great product!</li>
      <li>shipping was super fast too!</li>
      <li>it gives your skin - a fantastic luminosity that even my 16 year old commented on two days in a row when I had no makeup on.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed a better overall quality to the texture of my skin, just can&#x27;t get rid of the pesky sun damage</li>
      <li>Overall, when I have facials, I am told I have lovely skin.</li>
      <li>I noticed results within the first week of using this product.</li>
      <li>Do not expect overnight results, I really started seeing results about 2 weeks in, and now after 1 month I am just blown away!</li>
      <li>this is the first product I do not like and will not reorder.</li>
      <li>This serum is very light, has no perceptible smell and sinks right in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure about all the good reviews here.</li>
      <li>In fact I love devita, it is the only effective, gentle ALL NATURAL skin care line that I have found that is absolutely not greasy nor does it cause breakouts at all.  </li>
      <li>The pump isn&#x27;t very efficient.  </li>
      <li>and I really like the results.  </li>
      <li>The Devita Sun Damage Repair Serum really HAS to be used in combination with DEVITA Skin Brightening Serum with Kojic Acid</li>
      <li>It works very well for my skin; improved it within 2 weeks</li>
      <li>It goes on very silky and smooth, not greasy at all and as one other reviewer mentioned, your skin drinks it up.  </li>
      <li>Product came promptly and so far, I really like it.</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t used it for long enough to be able to tell if it is working, but thought prospective buyers should be advised about the gel vs. serum issue.</li>
      <li>I feel that I cannot live without this product.  </li>
      <li>If you are in your 40s, as I am, and want to use natural skincare that fights sagging, this is it!  </li>
      <li>I gave it two stars only because I love Devita&#x27;s other things from their site.</li>
      <li>I use it nearly every night under my night-time moisturizer.</li>
      <li>but I appreciate the natural ingredients and safety rating according to the EWG website.</li>
      <li>All natural ingredients do work</li>
      <li>I am 48 years old with some sun damage on my face/chest.  </li>
      <li>It contains retinol which keeps my face SO smooth and copper which actually keeps my skin feeling firm.  </li>
      <li>However, it is a major</li>
      <li>First it has an odd consistency</li>
      <li>It is a rather small bottle &amp; it does go quickly</li>
      <li>Secondly, the product doesn&#x27;t seem as if it&#x27;s full or something (comes out odd like a glob of gel and the bottle doesn&#x27;t seem like its going to last long).</li>
      <li>Really works-- sun damaged skin is a lot less red, and it started working within a couple of days!</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that my skin has been breaking out a little more than often, maybe just adjusting to this newer product.</li>

    <li> If you are in your 40s, as I am, and want to use natural skincare that fights sagging, this is it!  It contains retinol which keeps my face SO smooth and copper which actually keeps my skin feeling firm.  I feel that I cannot live without this product.  I use it nearly every night under my night-time moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love Devita products; however, I have not noticed any reduction of my sun damage. I have been using this product for a month. I will continue to use it until it is all gone. I have noticed a better overall quality to the texture of my skin, just can&#x27;t get rid of the pesky sun damage</li>
    <li> This product exfoliates and moisturizers, got rid of redness and bumpyness on my forehead. Calms skin really love this product!!!! All natural ingredients do work you just have to find the right formulation!</li>
    <li> I needed a face serum that wouldn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky.  I&#x27;m also prone to breakouts, but still get wrinkles.  If that&#x27;s not enough, my skin is super-sensitive!  This serum is so light and gentle that I can use it every night, including around my eyes, without any tacky residue.  I use it as my nightly eye serum, so this product does double duty.  The only downside is the price -- YIKES, and for only one ounce!  This bottle lasts me about one month, but I use at least 5 pumps for my face, eyes, throat and chest.  Still, I love it!</li>
    <li> I use this nightly and after my weekly salicylic acid peel and BAM! i swear i thought I had gained weight in my face but I realized my face was getting firmer and smoothing out EVERYTHING from using this product! It does significantly reduce pigmentation.  When I run out I will probably get the stronger RX version to see even more dramatic results! This product description does not contain all the ingredients though because on my bottle it says there is Jojoba seed oil.  To be honest I would probably had not bought this had i known that because my skin is very VERY sensitive and breaks out with any carrier oil.  HOWEVER my skin soaks this stuff in as if there were absolutely no oil.  I LOVE this stuff!! In fact I love devita, it is the only effective, gentle ALL NATURAL skin care line that I have found that is absolutely not greasy nor does it cause breakouts at all.  Tell your girlfriends!!</li>
    <li> The Devita Sun Damage Repair Serum really HAS to be used in combination with DEVITA Skin Brightening Serum with Kojic Acid</li>
    <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s really starting to fade my sunspots and it even helped sooth a sun burn I got on the Fourth of July.  I&#x27;m am overall happy I bought this. shipping was super fast too!</li>
    <li> This miracle product does exactly what it says! I had very dark red sun spots on my nose and some small wrinkles around my eyes. I have been using this product just once a day at night after my shower, and most of the sun spots and wrinkles are gone in just a month! Do not expect overnight results, I really started seeing results about 2 weeks in, and now after 1 month I am just blown away! Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It&#x27;s gel type serum. it absorb quickly, not sticky, but it moisturize well. My skin looks healthy and lighter. One sad thing is that this gel is a bit hard,and sometimes doesn&#x27;t come out.</li>
    <li> Copper peptides are amazing and this serum is wonderful. I noticed results within the first week of using this product. I have purchased many brands of facial creams and products that contained empty promises, but not this serum it delivers great results. I can&#x27;t imagine not sing this for the long term. I have gotten compliments on my skin and people are always amazed when I tell them I use Davita and I ordered it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The instructions for this product tell you to &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; it into your skin.  This is impossible, as it is not a serum, but a gel, which dries almost immediately and isn&#x27;t of the proper consistency to massage into anything.  What i do is put some on my finger, add a drop of my collegen gel, mix them, and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it for long enough to be able to tell if it is working, but thought prospective buyers should be advised about the gel vs. serum issue.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product at night before I go to bed and I simply love how it soaks into my skin.  I alternate the use of this as a every other night thing and I really like the results.  I have fair freckled skin and I feel that this product evens out my skin tone.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> I appreciate that this product is made from natural ingredients, and it has a nice gel texture that absorbs well, with no grease or sticky residue. The pump isn&#x27;t very efficient.  I had to open the jar and try to scrape out the last 20% of the contents.  Most importantly, I just couldn&#x27;t tell that my skin improved at all from using it. It&#x27;s just too expensive to do absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> This product is fast and easy to absorb. Perfect for any skin and I love how it feels. My husband will use it too~!</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I noticed the difference in my skin withing a few days. My skin protests if I&#x27;m a day without it!</li>
    <li> A waste of money ..this stuff don&#x27;t work !!</li>
    <li> Although I love this line, I do not like this product at all and I do not feel it is helping my skin. First it has an odd consistency (a glob comes out from the pump) and it is pricey. I don&#x27;t mind pricey if the product is works. I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective bottle of this or what as I usually order from Devita&#x27;s website and this is the first product I do not like and will not reorder. I&#x27;m not sure about all the good reviews here. They don&#x27;t seem to make sense to me. Secondly, the product doesn&#x27;t seem as if it&#x27;s full or something (comes out odd like a glob of gel and the bottle doesn&#x27;t seem like its going to last long). Still a Devita girl...but this is not up to par with the products I have received from the Devita site. Will not be reordering. I gave it two stars only because I love Devita&#x27;s other things from their site.</li>
    <li> Really works-- sun damaged skin is a lot less red, and it started working within a couple of days!</li>
    <li> this is nice stuff.  did not make me break out but the devita rejuvination seemed to work better on my wrinkles.  i will buy that again when i run out of this.</li>
    <li> Product came promptly and so far, I really like it. I have been using it for over a month now &amp; have even had a couple compliments on my skin. It is a rather small bottle &amp; it does go quickly but I appreciate the natural ingredients and safety rating according to the EWG website. My only complaint is that my skin has been breaking out a little more than often, maybe just adjusting to this newer product. Overall, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am a skin product junkie and bought this based on the reviews here online.  I am 48 years old with some sun damage on my face/chest.  Overall, when I have facials, I am told I have lovely skin. I attribute it to exercise and buying good products. At the end of each Summer, even with the use of sunscreen, I like to find something special to ramp my skin up and get it glowing for colder months.  This serum is the bomb and I&#x27;ve use several in my lifetime.  It goes on very silky and smooth, not greasy at all and as one other reviewer mentioned, your skin drinks it up.  The best part of this serum is the instant glow it gives your skin - a fantastic luminosity that even my 16 year old commented on two days in a row when I had no makeup on.  The even better part is the immediate reduction in color of brown spots.  I have also found this to give my skin exceptional clarity without breakouts.  I use this twice a day with my night time usage being after I use my Clarisonic as it seems to make the delivery system even more intense.  I&#x27;ll be buying this serum and trying other products from this line again.  WOW is all I can say - best purchase!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I used it a couple times and I swear it worked instantly.&lt;br /&gt;The only Problem is the bottle and ceramic floor. I dropped it and the glass broke and I lost about 80 percent of the product. Guess it&#x27;s not great for traveling but great product!</li>
    <li> It works very well for my skin; improved it within 2 weeks and im loving the compliments! I will always buy this product!</li>
    <li> This serum is very light, has no perceptible smell and sinks right in. However, it is a major No when you&#x27;re also using Vitamin C. Wish the description warned users of that! My dermatologist had to tell me (with a frown). And left to choose, I&#x27;ll keep my Vitamin C.</li>
