    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my clarisonic for 3 years and hadn&#x27;t even thought about looking into a less expensive alternative to the replacement brush heads.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this combo pack on Amazon.  It comes with all the different brush heads available with the clarisonic, and the quality seems identical.  I love the fact that this combo pack allows me the opportunity to try some of the brush heads I never would&#x27;ve before because of the cost.  Lastly, the manufacturer followed up with me via email the day my package arrived, to explain all the brush heads in detail and to offer assistance should I have any questions.  I will NEVER buy the clarisonic brand name replacement heads again because this is just as good.</li>
    <li> Glad I found these. Fits my clarisonic perfectly. Would have given 5 stars but brushes are not marked which brush is for which purpose. I suppose it does the job either way.</li>
    <li> I received one brush damaged, and have tried to contact the sellers about this but have not gotten a response. Otherwise, I am pleased with the purchase. The quality is fine for a generic and I&#x27;ve had no issues with my Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I wish the heads were labelled.  I just picked one and put it in.  plush and firm, feels great!</li>
    <li> The brushs were to soft</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price and way cheaper than the department stores.</li>
    <li> Good value for the cost compared to the originals.&lt;br /&gt;Slightly softer than originals.&lt;br /&gt;Overall happy with the purchase&lt;br /&gt;If the girlfriend likes them enough we will probably order these again over the originals</li>
    <li> Ordered the value 5 pack, they&#x27;re the same brush head just different colors.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast...brush heads work great (and an excellent price!).  Definitely will order again!!!!</li>
    <li> Brushes are a good quality.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for a significant savings from the &amp;#34;Mia&amp;#34; branded heads.  They perform at the same level as the MIA heads, the bushes are of equal quality.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best knock-off brush heads I&#x27;ve used! They are a little softer but work as well as the real clarisonic. Delivery was quick. No complaints here!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, products showed up as described. It fits Mia 2 product nicely. I have been using it for a month. Don&#x27;t have any problems with it.</li>
    <li> As others have said, the middle bristles do not rotate properly. Instead, they vibrate and do not function as well on the higher speeds.</li>
    <li> Although these are a great price two of my brush heads came damaged. I will say I received a prompt reply and offer of a replacement or refund.</li>
    <li> Received these items same day I ordered!!! Awesome. I started using the first brush the first night and it worked perfectly. The blue brushes are super soft and they make a lot of suds :) Super Happy Customer</li>
    <li> 5 for the price of one!!  they fit perfectly, work perfectly and i&#x27;m absolutely thrilled!</li>
    <li> So far its been working really well.</li>
    <li> Great quality, just as well made as clarisonic. I have the 3 Aria and it fits perfectly. Only thing I wish is they include a color match for each brush type....came quickly and well packaged</li>
    <li> Nice to find replacements that aren&#x27;t $30.00 each!</li>
    <li> Love these!! Perfect for my Clarisonic Plus brush.</li>
    <li> for the price these works great.  The fit my clarisonic and I didn&#x27;t break the bank for it.</li>
    <li> Clearly not the quality of Clarisonic brushes in regards to a natural bristle feel, but for the price, they&#x27;re very acceptable and the manufacturing is ever bit as good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy them again as I like swapping out my brush heads every 3 months.</li>
