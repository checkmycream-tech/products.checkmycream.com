      <li>So hopefully you are ok with complete strangers wanting a sniff of your beautiful hair!</li>
      <li>I have tried SO many hair products to do what this does.</li>
      <li>Which makes it even better.</li>
      <li>way better than bio silk and Than the ones from hair salons.</li>
      <li>And huge plus, it seems DEVINE.</li>
      <li>This product makes my hair shiny and makes it look fresh and healthy</li>
      <li>Everyone asks me why I smell so good and are surprised when I tell them it&#x27;s my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair stayed smooth and nice the whole day</li>
      <li>I have my hair streaked and this product brought the unique color of the streaks in my hair.  </li>
      <li>Nice product for frizz keeps hair soft and helps keep it straightened.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and when the bottle is gone, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again!</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t leave your hair greasy, even feels great on your skin and hands and will not weigh your hair down.</li>
      <li>I love all of the products, but I especially love the serum because it gives me a tangible product I can manipulate through my dry hair and ends and feel the smooth and silkiness while I am blow drying or just giving my hair a heat break and let it dry naturally.</li>
      <li>I love this product, great for when hair when wet or done styling to smooth out dry ends.</li>
      <li>this is my second shipment of this product and I am very pleased Thanks</li>
      <li>I am an avid &#x27;</li>
      <li>My hair is always misbehaving - gets a lot of frizz no matter how much hair product I use.  </li>
      <li>I have very curly hair and after a shower this is what I use to get a brush through it.</li>
      <li>Love this product but you have to be careful with amount you use as it is a thicker oil.</li>
      <li>I bought a bottle for my mom too and she has really frizzy/wiry hair</li>
      <li>Also it has a very light smell so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with other fragranced products or perfume.</li>
      <li>I am a platinum blonde and take my hair through a drill course every three weeks, so finding a product that puts my hair back into tip top shape is a never ending search.</li>
      <li>Does what it says and it definitely takes care of my very frizzy Puerto Rican hair!!</li>
      <li>I bought this to replace the wen hair serum I used up (worked great but too expensive).</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft just like when my hairstylist does my hair.</li>
      <li>It enhanced the beauty of my hair completely.</li>
      <li>I usually have somewhat dry/frizzy ends, especially after blow-drying and straightening my hair, and I dye my hair too, so this really works well to help keep the ends smooth.  </li>
      <li>You only need a small pea-sized drop for shoulder length hair, and it really smooths your hair and makes it super soft!  </li>
      <li>4 oz. goes a long way as well, and lasts much longer than the leave in product sprays which is a big plus on the wallet.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased it at the salon in May 2011, and this small bottle lasted me over 2 1/2 years!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years, and this is the first time I have bought a replacement bottle.  </li>

    <li> I am an avid &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; user. I am a platinum blonde and take my hair through a drill course every three weeks, so finding a product that puts my hair back into tip top shape is a never ending search. Until I found this product line. It is so hard to find the serum in stores, even in our local beauty store so  I am so happy I found it online for a great price (cheaper than ordering through the beauty store catalogue.) I love all of the products, but I especially love the serum because it gives me a tangible product I can manipulate through my dry hair and ends and feel the smooth and silkiness while I am blow drying or just giving my hair a heat break and let it dry naturally. It cuts the dry time, and frizz time. And huge plus, it seems DEVINE. Everyone asks me why I smell so good and are surprised when I tell them it&#x27;s my hair. So hopefully you are ok with complete strangers wanting a sniff of your beautiful hair! 4 oz. goes a long way as well, and lasts much longer than the leave in product sprays which is a big plus on the wallet. My mother snags this from me all the time (along with all my other hair products). It won&#x27;t leave your hair greasy, even feels great on your skin and hands and will not weigh your hair down. I only wish it came in a bigger size.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells good. Relieves those edging hairs and smoothes them out. Would reccomend the product. Try and buy online, it tends to be cheaper that a beauty/or drug store.</li>
    <li> It was good but not for my hair, my sister ended up using it and loves it</li>
    <li> Love this product but you have to be careful with amount you use as it is a thicker oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years, and this is the first time I have bought a replacement bottle.  I originally purchased it at the salon in May 2011, and this small bottle lasted me over 2 1/2 years!  And I used it almost every single day!  You only need a small pea-sized drop for shoulder length hair, and it really smooths your hair and makes it super soft!  I use it after blow-drying and straightening as a finishing smoother.  It smells amazing too!!  I usually have somewhat dry/frizzy ends, especially after blow-drying and straightening my hair, and I dye my hair too, so this really works well to help keep the ends smooth.  Beware if you use too much, it will make your hair dirty and greasy feeling!  I bought a bottle for my mom too and she has really frizzy/wiry hair and she is hooked on the stuff!</li>
    <li> Nice product for frizz keeps hair soft and helps keep it straightened. I will purchase this item again. Rated it a five star.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Definitely helps to create slippage when combing out my wet colored hair.</li>
    <li> I struggle with dry hair.. My hairstylist introduced me to this product. It makes my hair so soft just like when my hairstylist does my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product for helping with tangled hair and damaged hair. A little goes a long way... smaller than a pea size for medium thick hair &amp; medium length.</li>

    <li> this product tamed by frizzy hair and left my hair shining and curly.  No more dry friz.  I have my hair streaked and this product brought the unique color of the streaks in my hair.  It enhanced the beauty of my hair completely.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair shine, and smooths out the fly-away strands.  The smell is divine!  This is the only product that keeps my hair silky after straightening it.</li>
    <li> My hair is always misbehaving - gets a lot of frizz no matter how much hair product I use.  One of my niece has this and I tried it.  The result was amazing!  My hair stayed smooth and nice the whole day so I ordered my own bottle of this serum.  No more bad hair day for me.  My only complain is the pump - not working.</li>
    <li> most amazing hair serum!!!!!!! way better than bio silk and Than the ones from hair salons.</li>
    <li> Love this! It&#x27;s a must. I have tried SO many hair products to do what this does. I&#x27;m very pleased and when the bottle is gone, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Perfection. I bought this to replace the wen hair serum I used up (worked great but too expensive). It&#x27;s a 10 is a great product; no frizz, non-greasy on my hair, and it holds up for two days. Also it has a very light smell so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with other fragranced products or perfume.</li>
    <li> The It&#x27;s a 10 products are the best products I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair. The serum and the styling cream together are awesome.</li>
