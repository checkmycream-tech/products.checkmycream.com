<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This brush is the definition of perfect! Its definitely an airbrush finish touch :)</li>
    <li> Love this brush. It&#x27;s soft and works great from bronzer.</li>
    <li> Really lovely brush. Provides superb coverage when applying liquid foundation. Yes, it is a bit pricey for a brush but you definitely get a higher quality product.</li>
    <li> Makes foundation look flawless</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this brush.  I used to use \\&quot;beauty blenders\\&quot; (a popular brand of foundation application sponges) to apply foundation.  Discovering this brush is the best thing that ever happened to my face.  It literally does look like my foundation was applied with an airbrush and I find that it&#x27;s so efficient that I use much less foundation than I normally would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently one of my friends was complaining that her face was really blotchy and reapplying her foundation did absolutely nothing for her. I told her to try using my brush and it actually was able to completely mask the blotchiness.  I&#x27;m very impressed and I&#x27;ll probably be giving this away to my girlfriends as a christmas present.</li>
    <li> So I just got the brush and it is NOT the same one pictured on this page. It is a tarte brush but it is a lot longer and the bristles don&#x27;t look the same. Has anyone else had this problem? I am not sure whether to use it if it is still a good brush or return it.</li>
    <li> I have this brush and it is the best brush I have ever owned!! Worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Has quickly become my new favorite makeup brush. I love tarte products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE with this brush!! it&#x27;s high quality and super soft! I&#x27;ve had many MAC brushes and I thought those were nice, but this one is the softest I&#x27;ve ever had! It feels so amazing against my face &amp; applies my foundation perfectly. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this, you will be too! :)</li>
    <li> Best foundation brush- soft, durable and flawless application.  Nothing more to say...</li>
    <li> This is my go-to brush.  I do use this with Tarte&#x27;s Amazonian Clay Foundation and it works wonderfully.  It helps to buff your skin to a flawless look.  I dot my makeup on my face in different areas and then use the brush to buff in circular motions.  When I need a bit more coverage, instead of buffing I press the brush into the skin a few times (not sure what that movement is called).  It&#x27;s soft and gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I already have one of these brushes and love it. But this replacement brush isn&#x27;t quite the same. The bristles are much softer than expected.</li>
    <li> Perfect for Tarte full coverage foundation!&lt;br /&gt;:) Blends it in really well</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, less than from tarte!  Brush is beautiful to hold and look at.  The brush head is very large and dense.  bristles.  Still not sure I like it better than my old two-ended IT Cosmetics brush for applying powder foundation, but I am still practicing, so am not the best judge.  It covers a lot of ground, and would be a good brush for body powders, if you are into that.</li>
    <li> LOVE!! Leaves your makeup perfect, I even use it to blend my contoured part , it is a bit tougher to clean but worth the buy!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing! I use it every day and it gives your makeup such an even look. It&#x27;s so soft. It is a little bit big for around the nose but other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Use it daily to apply foundation and it works great.</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft, so dense and it is so pretty to look at. The quality is amazing! I had no plan as to what I was going to use this brush for, I just wanted it. It is a multi tasker in my brush collection. It really gives foundation a air brushed finish.  I also like using it with setting powder or with my Tarte Amazoian Clay 12 hour powder foundation.  It&#x27;s a multi purpose brush and I am so happy to own it.</li>
    <li> I was well over do... My last buffer I bought was 17 years ago. This Tarte Buffer is an excellent tool. The finished texture of the my foundation is smooth. Almost flawless! So glad I choose this product.</li>
    <li> Not sure why, but in always seem to gravitate back to this brush. I am a makeup artist and will use this on myself religiously and/or on clients (additional brush). I kid you not, the coverage and finish you get with this brush is unparalleled. I have a plethora of top notch brushes and this one takes the cake. It can be used with both liquid and powder. For liquid make a nice, even, blended layer and then use a stipple motion with extra product for spot coverage. For powder, get a generous amount and either lightly buff or just pat/stipple.  That&#x27;s it! Flawless each and every time.</li>
    <li> Before using this brush I always used the a standard flat foundation brush. This tarte brush gives such a flawless finish that I never realized how flawed my makeup application had been previously. Once you try this brush you won&#x27;t want to use anything else to apply your foundation.</li>
    <li> Very light in weight, professional and well constructed. When I glide this on my face to apply the foundation, I felt like air very soft, absorbed the mineral foundation, easy application, this brush is a must have for your everyday use.</li>
    <li> Firmer than I was hoping it would be.</li>
    <li> It will give you a flawless look ( I use liquid foundation). It cost $32 at ulta ( pricey) but you will be happy with the outcome ,</li>
    <li> Blends foundation great, and easy to clean (I use 91% alcohol to clean my brushes)</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Works well for foundation - makes it go on so much smoother</li>
    <li> to buy this on QVC you have to buy product, which honestly don&#x27;t want to do, just wanted the brush.  This was the only place to buy brush only, at the time when I purchased.  you will like the feel of this on your skin.  To clean just use castile soap, cheaper than buying expensive brush soap.</li>
    <li> wife loves it, says it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> I will add my accolades to everyone else&#x27;s review. What a wonderful brush! I have no idea how I lived without it. It&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve ever found for applying foundation. Period.</li>
    <li> OK, I just got it today so I will have to do an update review later, but so far I love this brush!  It has the perfect density and it&#x27;s super soft.  It&#x27;s a big brush, larger than most foundation brushes, but I kind of love that about it.  It actually looks more like a powder or bronzing brush, and I&#x27;m sure could be used for that as well.  I&#x27;ll let you know how I feel about it in a few weeks :)&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I still love this brush :) I use it for powder or mineral foundation.  It&#x27;s great for blending and buffing large areas, but harder to work around angles like your nose and eyes.  I haven&#x27;t found this to be a problem at all, just something I thought I should note.  I love this brush and would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this with my liquid foundation and it&#x27;s amazing!  I feel like I get a thinner coverage than I do with my other foundation brush, but it is flawless.  I love this brush.  It&#x27;s versatile and wonderful with everything I use.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. I use it to apply my mineral makeup powder over the foundation and it&#x27;s such a nice finish. The bristles are oh so soft, but the body of the brush is really good, it holds it all together so you can actually direct the application where you need it. I&#x27;ve had brushes that are too wide and just hard to manage, but this one is super soft. Wonderful size, and excellent also if you want to use for applying blush or finishing powders. I&#x27;d buy from Tarte again. It seems like a super nice quality and it was worth the price. Even though I&#x27;ve just had a few weeks, I feel it&#x27;ll last a very long time!</li>
    <li> BEST best best brush ever!!  I gave everyone this brush for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Foundation goes on like a dream! And quickly, too!</li>
    <li> I adore this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Applying foundation is super quick and easy when using the Tarte Buffer Airbrush Finish Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very dense and will definitely provide you with an airbrush finish. I am no stranger to applying makeup, and whenever I get called by a client, I always make sure this is in my kit because I know they will be astounded by the results.&lt;br /&gt;It easily spreads and blends foundation effortlessly, making it all the more easier and quicker option even for hard to blend foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used baby shampoo to clean this brush - it must have been hundreds of times - and it has still kept its shape, texture, and effectiveness. I have yet to see one bristle fall from this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is meant to use with the Tarte foundation, but you can honestly use it with whatever foundation you like! I might also add that it is perfect for applying powder as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promise you will be amazed at how effective this brush is, while maintaining it&#x27;s softness throughout the years.</li>
    <li> Great brush! Covers smoothly and very soft :)</li>
    <li> I really like my brush. This myfirst time trying it and I really llke it. My funndation go on great and even. I have let my friends and family know about this brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome and well worth the money. Gives a great finish.</li>
    <li> A good makeup brush is essential and in my opinion, this brush is as good as it gets.  I just wish that Tarte sold a concealer brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!  I always used my fingers while applying foundation, but that is a distant memory!  This brush does not shed and buffs foundation into your skin with no streaks, giving you a flawless, perfectly smooth complexion!  Thank you Tarte!  I use with my Tarte Amazonian Clay 15spf Waterproof Foundation which makes this a perfect duo to a beauty regime.  I will never change brands!</li>
    <li> I use to think brushes didn&#x27;t have anything to do with the look of the makeup. I honestly thought it was just some prissy obsession to have fun with applying your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;THEN I bought a Mac brush. I thought, &#x27;WOAH! This DOES WORK! There IS a difference!&#x27; I didn&#x27;t like how they wasted SO much expensive makeup that the brushes would pick up. However I became a HUGE advocate that the right brush can dang near make ANY foundation amazing!&lt;br /&gt;So I started buying more and more brushes because I kept finding better and better ones!&lt;br /&gt;I saw this brush on a youtube makeup video and I couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing it was. So I took the gamble and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;BOY AM I GLAD I DID.&lt;br /&gt;I now use less then HALF of the makeup I normally do and that&#x27;s not even the best news! I FINALLY have an airbrushed look.&lt;br /&gt;I never thought it would be possible and boy is it ever.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed. This is one of those products that I almost want to buy a spare in case something happens and they stop making them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it! :)</li>
    <li> I love this foundation brush! It has to be the best brush ever. I have a MAC 190 brush and an ELF stipple brush for foundation...but none works as beautifully as the Tarte brush. This is the first Tarte product I&#x27;ve ever had and I am super impressed. The brush is super dense, very soft, and it applies easily. It was definatly worth the price.</li>
    <li> If my Tarte brush disappeared one day, I would cancel all my plans and go on a search to replace it.  Thats how much I love this brush!!!  It applies my powder foundation perfectly and it prevents any caking which has always been a problem for me.  This is a winner!</li>
    <li> Takes alot to put foundation on with this. I rather use it for powder. Maybe blush but Still like it. It does use alot of soap to wash all the makeup away. Thats the down side but real soft and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I got a completely different brush lol idk if this is a scam or not but it is a taste brush just not the one in the pic. disappointed cus I wanted a small buffing brush.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush</li>
    <li> Tarte brush was odorless  and had firm plush fibers.  Very good for applying and blending foundation.  Good value and I recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this, the feel is soft against your skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush on QVC.  It came with my order of Tarte Amazonian Clay foundation.  This blush does a beautiful job blending the foundation into my skin.  It really gives a great, natural looking finish.  That foundation in particular isn&#x27;t the easiest to apply and I definitely think that the brush and foundation together look beautiful.  It also makes application very fast.  However, I have 2 issues with the brush.  First, it is incredibly hard to get foundation to look good on the nose.  the brush is simply too big.  For this reason, I have been finding myself using the Real Techniques Expert Face brush to get foundation on my nose.  Second, it&#x27;s a pain to wash.  The brush is SO dense that it takes a while to get all the product out of it.  It really gets embedded in there.  My regular MAC Brush Cleaner doesn&#x27;t really cut it for this.  I need to use my Neutrogena makeup removing foaming face wash to effectively remove makeup residue and then follow with the MAC Brush Cleaner to condition it.  This brush seams to suck in more product than the Expert Face Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like it though.  I actually have two.  I use the second one to apply powder.  It&#x27;s especially great for my Smashbox Halo Powder.  Also at $32, the price is REALLY reasonable for a brush of this quality.</li>
    <li> This brush does a great job blending my foundation, very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I never believed that creme foundation was able to get an airbrush effect but this brush proved me wrong. Helps cover evenly, flawless and fast without leaving bristle marks (like other foundation brushes do). Washable and soft. One of my makeup best friends. If using with Tarte Amazonian clay foundation, even better.</li>
    <li> I just received my brush today and it was love at first touch! Yes, this brush is pricey but it was soooo worth it! I applied liquid foundation with it and the result was an airbrush soft look! I simply love it! I have yet to try it with powder but I know it will work wonders too.Can&#x27;t say enough about this brush! Love my Tarte :)</li>
    <li> I DONT REGRET BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! It&#x27;s a great investment for just this brush.... It&#x27;s great for foundation and powder products just great for blending everything in!! And it seems just like new every time you wash it no hairs come out there really secured in there place... And did I mention the brush is SOOO SOFTY!!!! LOVE IT !!!!</li>
    <li> Learned about this brush from a make up artist. Blends make up flawlessly. Great product!</li>
