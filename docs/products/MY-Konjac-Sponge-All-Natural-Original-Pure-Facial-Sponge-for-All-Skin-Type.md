<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have been very pleased with this sponge - very gentle, but does exactly what is promised.  Great exfoliation.</li>
    <li> This changed the way I wash my face. It really makes my face feel so much cleaner and softer. It makes my facial cleaners foam up a bit more, which I thoroughly enjoy; it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m receiving some quick spa treatment. Love!</li>
    <li> I just discovered these things.  I like this one and keep one at the bathroom sink and one in the shower.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty remarkable how much this simple sponge has changed my skin. My skin is noticeably smoother, softer and I hardly break out anymore. I will probably re-purchase this forever.</li>
    <li> This sponge changed my skin care routine forever. I like this one more than the charcoal one. It&#x27;s just a simple white kinjac sponge and I like being able to see any makeup buildup so I know when to sanitize or replace it. I like that this has a string that you can hang it by. I learned the hard way some brands don&#x27;t provide this and although it isn&#x27;t a hard task to fulfill myself, it&#x27;s nice not to worry about it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin (if I touch my neck or chest they immediately turn red; if I touch my face, shoulders or back I&#x27;ll break out ... it&#x27;s a pain!), so I&#x27;m VERY picky about the products I use, especially on my face.  After reading a review about a Konjac sponge by a beauty editor who said something like &amp;#34;this sponge really works,&amp;#34; I decided to try the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; version of it.  I LOVE IT!  I immediately noticed that my skin looks brighter and the pores on my nose appear smaller.  Knock on wood, I also seem to have fewer breakouts.  I take my makeup off first, then use the sponge all over my face, then use my ProActiv skincare regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other users, no one else has commented on my &amp;#34;glowing skin,&amp;#34; but that doesn&#x27;t matter to me - I&#x27;d rather that I be satisfied with it.  I started using the sponge about a month ago, and I just ordered two more for when my existing sponge needs to be replaced (although it&#x27;s still in perfectly good condition after using it twice per day for a month).  I contemplated trying one of the clay sponges but decided to stick with the sensitive version due to previous skin problems.</li>
    <li> Think its helping clear up my skin</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I saw no benefits</li>
    <li> I love this sponge.  I had never heard of it when I received it as a gift one Christmas.  I didn&#x27;t even know what it was, and I tried to eat it!  But once I tried it, I loved how my skin felt after cleansing with it.  It seems to do a better job of exfoliating my skin than my Clarisonic,  And it&#x27;s so soft when you&#x27;re cleansing.  My only beef is that it falls apart after a while, and these are not cheap.  But I understand this is a natural product, and thus, would fall apart eventually.</li>
    <li> I have been using my sponge for about 2 weeks now and have noticed that my skin is softer and clearer. I recently had a baby which has caused my skin to become more oily. Based on the results that I have seen so far, I think I will purchase the charcoal sponge to see if it helps with the oil.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money... it doesn&#x27;t accomplish anything noticeable and it attracts mold</li>
    <li> On my third one of these.  Using a facial cleanser both morning and night strips my skin and dries it out, so I started using the konjac sponge + water in the morning instead of soap.  It works really well and provides gentle physical exfoliation.  My skin is left clean, smooth, and non-irritated.  I&#x27;ll continue to purchase these in the future!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but it was a recommended product in one of the health and wellness magazines I read. I find it to be effective and gentle on my skin, and I love how my skin feels when I use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Konjac sponge for a little over a week and I love it! It&#x27;s not abrasive at all and leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> If you need an exfoliating sponge like I do, this is not for you.  I did nothing to exfoliate my dry, flaky skin combined with an oily t-zone.  No good for me!  I ended up ordering the Buf Puf (gentle) and it works perfect.</li>
    <li> I started to break out after using this. I used it once a day.</li>
    <li> Love the sponge! I just reordered to share with family. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this for cleaning with my lotion.  Just the right amount of light abrasion for mature skin.  Only issue is they need to be replaced after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through so many facial sponges and I&#x27;ve even used a Clarisonic. I must say that this konjac sponge is better. I can feel such a huge different in my skin. The price for this sponge is also just as amazing. I will definitely be repurchasing it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks (just with water) and I love how it gently exfoliates. I can even get under my eyes and around my tear ducts to gently scrub away the flakes there with no irritation or redness afterward. It does take a long time to dry, but I press (not squeeze or wring!) it firmly between two towels and that helps to get most of the moisture out after use. If you treat it gently it will last a long time! no tears or signs of wear in mine yet and I&#x27;ve been using it once a day to once every other day. Haven&#x27;t noticed any miraculous improvements, but it does exfoliate well and make my skin smoother and brighter.</li>
    <li> These sponges are a great way to gently exfoliate your skin. I use the larger size in the shower on my arms and legs, and the teardrop sponge twice a day on my face. I will be ordering more in the future!</li>
    <li> I love this sponge. I was concerned when I first received it because it was hard as a rock. However, once you wet it, it becomes super soft. It&#x27;s great for cleansing and exfoliating sensitive skin. I use it daily!</li>
    <li> This product has been life-changing for me as and it has improved my skin care routine. I have oily skin but since I started using the konjac sponge it has controlled my oil. It makes my face feel squeaky clean! It&#x27;s super soft and gentle on the skin. Plus, it&#x27;s so much fun to use! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I gave this product a try! I have fair, very sensitive skin to ingredients and texture. I have horrible breakouts and flareups if the products I use are too abrasive on my skin, but if I don&#x27;t exfoliate enough, I get clogged pores. I have been using this about a week and have not had any major breakouts or flareups while this continues to keep my skin smooth and pH balanced. It&#x27;s also slowly helping to exfoliate and fade the hyper-pigmentation I have. You can use it without a face cleanser, but I use mine with one and think it has double the cleaning power without stripping my face. Better than fingers, but gentler than a washcloth. It&#x27;s the perfect in-between. These are definitely worth giving a shot if you haven&#x27;t tried them!</li>
    <li> A simple and natural way to fight dry skin and revive its texture during these cold days. Very good product, which I strongly advise to buy for those who are looking for a good natural product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so soft! I love it</li>
    <li> great products, get seller, will be back again</li>
    <li> A wonderful product to make certain all your makeup is off and your face is clean.</li>
    <li> I love these Konjac sponges, they have replace the expensize clairsonic for me, however these do not last very long. They tend to dry out after a month or so.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your time and money, it is good i guess to remove make up only, nothing special about this sponge.</li>
    <li> Gentle, yet very thorough exfoliation.  I use it twice a day and I love the texture of my skin afterwards.  Can be used with and without a cleanser.  Less breakouts since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous about this purchase and wanted to wait a week use the product before I provided feedback. I really really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I like how it feels on my face as I am washing it. it is so gentle around my eyes. my skin feels so smooth and clean. when I am done washing my face I rinse and hang to dry.  I am going to order more, and look at the other konjac sponges.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; sponge. I purchased this bc I&#x27;ve seen good things abt it on YouTube however I&#x27;ve had it for almost a month now &amp; I don&#x27;t rly feel like it does anything for me? Maybe it&#x27;s bc I have the sensitive one so its not working to its full potential? I do have normally dry/sensitive skin so I didn&#x27;t want to purchase any random one &amp; have it break me out. I&#x27;m not disappointed in this product but I probably won&#x27;t be repurchasing it.</li>
    <li> Ok, this is weird.. Its like washing your face with a handful of mushy pasta. It is so gentle that i was sure that it wasnt doing anything but my skin feels wonderful after using it.  You just have to make sure that you let it dry completely between uses or mold can grow.. Not a problem for me, just hang it by the string over the tap and its dry by next day. Never tried it to remove make up so cant comment.. A great gentle exfoliant.. Woud recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this sponge for a week now but so far it&#x27;s awesome! Seller shipped it fast! And I love that you need no soap to use it! Saves me a bundle of money not having to buy expensive face washes!</li>
    <li> The company shipped the sponge in an extremely timely manner. I love the sponge and alternate between no facial soap and the putting facial soap on it. I love that just the sponge will keep your face clean and refreshed. The sponge feels so soft and gentle but also worked wonders on my blackhead. I will continue to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> I love using this as a natural facial cleanser! I only use water with this, and you only need to wet it until it soft, rub on your face, squeeze the water out and hang dry. It also last a few months! It&#x27;s a good price too.</li>
    <li> LIke this - on my 3rd week. Very clean feeling on my face after using.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for lazy girls who care about having nice skin (my kind of product). It comes at an affordable price and is so easy to use. It feels sooooo nice on the skin. Definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> Best face care sponge I&#x27;ve ever used! It has completely cleared up my combination skin and made my fine lines disappear. I have very sensitive skin and love this sponge. I am a lifelong fan and will be giving this product as a gift to all my friends and sisters!</li>
    <li> Arrived wet, made me break out! Yuck!</li>
    <li> Seller did great.  The PO didn&#x27;t.  Great product!  If you haven&#x27;t tried this you must.  My face felt so soft and smooth!  I will be buying again for sure!</li>
    <li> Great gentle exfoliator. It has a handy string for hanging to dry after use and is of good quality. Feels a little like gel when wet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for nearly a month now and its still going strong. It is really good at lightly exfoliating my face without it feeling &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34;. Much better than the brush type of cleaners that can damage your skin/pores in the long run. I highly recommend this sponge from this seller. Well worth the $10 I paid for it. Just remember that to ring it out for drying you need to push the water out (press it between your palms) rather than squeeze the water out (in your fist); it will last longer.</li>
    <li> LOVE this cute little sponge. My face has never looked better or felt better. Will be a regular buyer.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and very sensitive skin.  I read an article recently saying that even so-called sensitve brush heads on a cleansing brush was a bad idea for people with skin like mine (gulp!) Guess what I had been using?  This article recommended the Konjac sponge.  I had never heard of them before so I headed out to Amazon.com knowing they would have them whatever they were and sure enough they did.  I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and I have to say that I love it.  It is hard to describe but it feels really soft on your skin and you can&#x27;t believe it is acutally exfoliating but it is!  I have used it with and without liquid facial cleansers and it does not seem to make a difference in the cleansing ability of the sponge.  In fact, you need very little product because the sponge really spreads it well.&lt;br /&gt;I am a convert!</li>
    <li> Love this thing! Gets my skin clean with very little cleanser &amp; exfoliates at the same time. It&#x27;s a great size and very gentle.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend this product. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Works and feels great!</li>
    <li> Best sponge ever!  My skin feels great, it hat a thread to hang. I will be buying more for friends.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge. It really lathers up my cleanser for a foamy, gentle exfoliation.  My skin feels smoother and softer after.  I have pretty sensitive, acne-prone skin, but this is still gentle enough for me to use twice a day.</li>
    <li> I use a moisturizer with sunscreen, and even though my face wash has exfoliating beads, I still need something more for it to really feel clean.  This was the solution!</li>
    <li> Love how it feels on my face.</li>
    <li> Was not too impressed after the first few uses but after it has been hydrated several times I can see it working more effectively. It removes MOST make-up well (some of my pencil eyeliners will not remove but smudge when I used this). I also think it is good for exfoliation, I didn&#x27;t use it for several days and saw a few dry patches on my face that cleared up after using it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for anyone who has allergic skin.&lt;br /&gt;I find it more effective than those silly sonic face devices.&lt;br /&gt;It is gentle and earth friendly!!!</li>
    <li> Oh man, I love my konjac sponge. I have been using these for over a year and love, love, love them. I have super oily skin and this perfectly pH balances it. It thoroughly exfoliates my skin and I do not get oily all day. This is truly a secret gem. I get to s of compliments on my skin. Which I never did before.</li>
    <li> I love these -- they are amazing.  They totally change when they are wet and feel so good on my skin -- they are non-irritating and work really well...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 39 years old and starting to get more serious about my skin care, but not so serious that I want to put TOO much time into it. I use the sponge to gently exfoliate while I wash at night. I was using it morning and night, but that felt like too much. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and my skin does seem to have a subtle glow that it didn&#x27;t have before. It feels very clean, but in a soft way, not a stripped way.</li>
    <li> I had heard of this product from an online source.  Decided to purchase one for myself, and one for my daughter.  We are both very impressed with the results.  In the first application, I could feel a smooth texture to my skin.  I will continue to add this product as part of my facial care.  Also, I plan to buy extras and give them as gifts...</li>
    <li> I love the feel, soft and slippery like squeezing a bowl of Jell-O!  It does not hurt my face when I scrub it like my old facial cleaning brush!  But it does not clean as good as my old facial cleaning brush!  I&#x27;m happy with it and will continue using it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin got after using this sponge. It is so gentle on the skin and yet it does such a great job at cleansing the skin. I will definitely try some of the other sponges too.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this sponge. Usually I just use my hands for cleanser…I know I shouldn&#x27;t but I&#x27;m lazy. This sponge is great and easy and feels really cool. Haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions to it and my face is really soft.</li>
    <li> exactly as described!</li>
    <li> I bought 1 for myself and 1 for my daughter and they are lovely. I was concerned about my daughters sensative skin but this is very gentle. it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I SO LOVE this sponge!!! I use it, rinse it, and hang it by the string, to dry after every use. I got black mold spots showing up in less then 6 weeks.  This is a pretty expensive sponge to have to replace every six weeks.  Not sure if you will try it again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 65 and have very sensitive skin, but still need assistance with getting my skin really clean to prevent blackheads.  This sponge does a perfect job of cleansing my face in the morning with no other cleanser needed.  It also makes my pores seem smaller.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge - it lathers up easily, helps rinse your face off and leaves your skin very soft.  It works great with all types of cleansers, bars and liquids alike.  Glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> When I say I love this product, I mean it. It gently cleanses my face and leaves its looking/feeling great. Definitely must repurchase!</li>
    <li> Works wonders at controlling oils in my skin and cleaning off dirt and makeup!! Love it I&#x27;m a repeat buyer!! This brand is great I&#x27;ve tried the other sponges and they rock too! ❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> Sponges are exactly what I wanted and the price was excellent</li>
    <li> Not sure what the deal was, but after about a week, under my eyes turned red and I had to discontinue use.  I may try again and avoid my eyes by several inches.</li>
    <li> I have tried many cleaning items.  As long asI emember not to scrub too hard,I can use this every day.</li>
    <li> I have used all sorts of cleaning pads and cloths and sponges and all are generally rough.  When I wet the Konjac sponge it softened and felt like silk.  Amazingly gentle and soft and was excellent for facial washing.  I will now always wash with these sponges.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This sponge is great, soft enough to use every day. It surprised me it could work as well as it does with it being as non-abrasive as it is. Also works good for removing make-up even without cleanser (foundation &amp; eye shadow, not liner or mascara).</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these; one for myself and one for my 15 year old daughter.  We have different skin issues, mine being dryness and aging skin, hers being sensitive and prone to acne.  The sponge performed beautifully on both of us.  It was nice to give our skin a break from cleaners which can leave residue.  I will definitely be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> Love this brand of Konjac! In fact, I prefer it to Bosca, which is much more expensive. I was originally looking for a more gentle alternative to my clarisonic, and switched to the Konjac exclusively. It leaves my skin softer and smoother, feeling quite clean! The shape of this brand dries quickly (vs. the round Boscia) and there&#x27;s more surface area to touch the face. I&#x27;ve used the black charcoal sponge as well - don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference between the 2, but I like the white because I feel like I can see any makeup residue better, and I remember to boil it more often (just pop it in a mug of boiling water and microwave on high for 2 mins). It&#x27;s a winner for clean, smooth skin in my book!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I purchased this sponge. I definitely seen a difference in my skin after using it, especially with the texture of my skin. I find that I don&#x27;t have to exfoliate as often. I am one of those that don&#x27;t like to use a cleanser in the morning. I find it unnecessary for my skin and don&#x27;t want to over strip my skin. I started using this in the morning on its own while in the shower and its very gentle on my skin. Will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this Konjac Sponge.  It&#x27;s very easy to maneuver over the entire face and the result is quite noticeable.</li>
    <li> I use it sparingly but it still ended up drying the skin in my face. When used as directed, it&#x27;s very soft and has very little exfoliating properties.</li>
    <li> I use this daily and I love it.  I get a great cleaning with a &amp;#34;spa effect&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My skin is so soft after using this! Felt so good to massage my face!</li>
    <li> Love this product .&lt;br /&gt;It has helped clear my bad acne skin in just a week of using it</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SPONGE!!!!! It is so amazing. It has changed the texture of my skin and reduced the appearance of blackheads on my nose. Leaves my face baby soft. Giving them to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I use it every day and my skin is the smoothest its been in a long time! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  I&#x27;m over 50 and never been good about removing makeup at night. I also still have the occasional bout with break-outs.  This sponge makes it easy to clean my face and neck and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth without drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be ordering more as this one wears out.</li>
    <li> Read about these things in a magazine, but all the suggested brands were 20+ dollars. This is the same product for half the price! Works great, my skin is softer than ever and never gets red or irritated. Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this sponge!  Very unique and simple sponge with great results.  I love that there are no weird chemicals in it and they don&#x27;t do animal testing.</li>
    <li> Oh how I LOVE this sponge! It&#x27;s so gentle, yet exfoliates the skin. Very easy to use and makes my skin feel so clean. It&#x27;s going in all of my ladies Christmas baskets this year!</li>
    <li> Good, but not as spectacular as everyone made me think it would be</li>
    <li> I found this product on accident and have completely fallen in love! I have sensitive skin so it can prove challenging to find a product that works as it claims. However, my skin has never felt so soft after using the sponge for only a couple of days. It has now been a week and I plan to continue using this product for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;To &#x27;My Konjac Sponge&#x27;, thanks for taking the time to make a great product!</li>
    <li> The sponge has a nice exfoliating effect which I like as my skin is a bit sensitive to normal exfoliators. I can’t say I can feel or see a difference, but it’s still a nice sponge to cleanse my face with. It does not make my skin dry or red, but I think perhaps I would have been better off choosing one with a clay instead of the plain one...</li>
    <li> I heard about konjac sponges from friends and decided to try them. I have been using this for a few weeks and my skin is much smoother.</li>
    <li> This sponge is great.  Very durable and gently exfoliating.  I have been using it twice a day for about two weeks and it shows almost no sign of wear.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! It&#x27;s soft on your skin and leaves your face feeling luxurious, silky, clean and supple. And it helps tighten pores. My new favorite, and most likely a staple in my cabinet.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love my new Konjac sponge. It gently exfoliates without irritating my skin or using harsh chemicals. I only wish someone told me about this product sooner! I have purchased 5 of them and plan to use them forever!</li>
    <li> Love this. I bought 3!! Such a great price.</li>
    <li> Love this sponge!!! My skin is so soft and this is all I use to wash my face</li>
    <li> The sponge is super soft, it came in great time as well as good condition.  I *feel* like I need something a bit more course for my skin to feel clean.  This sponge, when wet, is more soft than a face cloth which is nice but not for me.  My skin did not react at all and my girls (age 7 and 9) enjoy using it too.  I just feel like I need more...</li>
    <li> I love this sponge! I use it every night. You don&#x27;t need any cleanser to remove make up and it leaves your skin feeling amazing! I take off my eye make up first and then finish with this sponge. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love it!  It&#x27;s super soft and feels great.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel soft and I don&#x27;t even use moisturizer afterwards but my skin feels soft.  I haven&#x27;t noticed much in the way of my blackheads or clogged pores yet but I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long so we&#x27;ll see ;)</li>
    <li> Amazing! I have extremely sensitive skin which is also oily, so I get clogged pores all the time. I can&#x27;t exfoliate because scrubs and acids are too harsh and leave my skin a red, irritated, broken out mess. But this Konjac sponge is a miracle. It is so gentle that it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all, yet it cleans and exfoliates very well leaving my skin soft and clear. I&#x27;ve been using it every night for a few weeks and no complaints. I purchased the original (white) sponge, which I assumed would be the most gentle, and so far it&#x27;s been fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is, so far, the only konjac sponge I have ever used.  I read that it was good at exfoliating, and as it is very inexpensive, I decided to give it a try.  Unfortunately, I was not very impressed.  I have used the sponge for several weeks with a bit of my regular cleanser (Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Recovery Cleanser).  I did notice immediately after the first use that my skin felt a little softer, though it didn&#x27;t necessarily look or feel any cleaner.  This was very exciting, but sadly other than feeling soft to the touch, I haven&#x27;t noticed any other differences with regular use.  My skin doesn&#x27;t look brighter or smoother, and my pores don&#x27;t look or feel tighter, as other reviewers have claimed.  I tend to get flakes around my nose and chin, and this sponge doesn&#x27;t completely remove them.  I&#x27;m still experiencing the same amount of breakouts in the same places, so it isn&#x27;t helping any on that front, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive, so trying new skin products can often lead to breakouts, dermatitis flares, and more.  This sponge caused none of those issues.  I think it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s more sustainable than an actual sponge.  I suspect my oldest child might appreciate the novelty of it, and therefore it might help her be more eager to wash her face (I have not tried this yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re the type that needs a washcloth or other product to apply cleanser, and you don&#x27;t like to just use your hands, then this is a decent product as it is very gentle.  However, it doesn&#x27;t really exfoliate much, and it certainly isn&#x27;t a miracle worker for ANY skin issues.  I feel like I get better looking skin just washing my face using clean hands and a gentle cleanser in combination with occasional chemical exfoliants.</li>
    <li> I have terrible skin and still have it in my 60s. At a regular monthly meeting with my sewing buddies and the day after I started using this sponge, someone asked me what I was using on my skin because it looked so much better. I haven&#x27;t missed a day using it since. My skin feels better; it looks much healthier. Well worth the cost and continued use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m becoming a major fan of MY Konjac! I&#x27;m ready to toss my kids&#x27; decorative germ filled poufs and replace them with MY Konjac baby sponges.  They do feel VERY fragile but as long as you squeeze (DO NOT WRING) and hang to dry it should last some time. Also, if  you do not sanitize sponges of any sort- GERMS will eat it away causing it to tear.</li>
    <li> This sponge is really gentle on your skin. I like that because it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s scraping all the oil out of my face... for me to just replace it with moisturizer after. It doesn&#x27;t remove make up well but that&#x27;s the only flaw I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
    <li> i love this konjac sponge. i have very sensitive skin that needs extra help with exfoliating since I get flakes and clogged pores, even with regular AHA use. the konjac sponge is the perfect way for me to physically exfoliate my skin gently, since even regular wash cloths can be abrasive and irritating. this leaves my skin soft and refreshed. when wet, the konjac sponge has a unique texture that&#x27;s like a jelly sponge! that makes it one of a kind.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s environmentally friendly and no sponges were harmed but I was extremely underwhelmed by this product. It did nothing special for me and it didn&#x27;t clean my face all that well. My skin didn&#x27;t dry out or get oily while using it, though. I honestly get better results with a basic washcloth. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> LOVE this sponge. It&#x27;s totally and completely natural, and my skin felt so hydrated that I almost thought it was oil.  But when I looked in the mirror there was no regular shine. My skin just looked healthy and normal, and it felt even better. It was sooo soft. At $10, this sponge is PERFECT, especially because it lasts 2-3 months. This sponge is so great that I ended up buying one for each of my sisters and for my mom.</li>
    <li> This sponge is so gentle on my skin.  It buffs away dead skin in a very effective manner.  It also allows cleansers,  if used,  to lather and distribute evenly.</li>
    <li> i am very pleased with this product - it does what it is supposed to do, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate the follow up concern from the company; I really liked that they followed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I wish I had known about this years ago. It really has been so good for my breakout prone skin. I use it with a handmade soap at night and just water in the morning. My skin no longer looks dull and actually glows.</li>
    <li> This sponge cleaned my face so well! No need for soap, just water. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This sponge is great.  It feels great on your skin and cleans very well.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd My Konjac Sponge and I really adore using these. I use them in the morning to cleanse my face and I use them at night to remove my makeup. They clean gently but effectively.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this before, this is so soft.  It&#x27;s gentle and you while using it I can see the dirt and makeup come off.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I don&#x27;t think I can live without it now that I&#x27;ve trIed it. Highly recommend to all to try.</li>
    <li> I chose this sponge after reading rave reviews about konjac in general, and I liked the price of this sponge over some of the ones sold in stores! I have used it every night with my cleanser, and I love it! It&#x27;s so gentle and so soft that it doesn&#x27;t feel at all like you are physically exfoliating your face. It also comes on a nice little string so it hangs perfectly in the shower when you&#x27;re done and always dries nicely! I&#x27;ve noticed that my face is smoother and my cystic acne seems to have gone down significantly.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> My skin reacts to everything and this sponge did not bother it at all. It felt scrubby and soothing at the same time. It has an interesting texture when wet, hard to describe. After using it for one week, I love it.</li>
    <li> Konjac sponges are quickly becoming my favorite kind of sponges to clean my face. You can totally use them alone or with your favorite cleanser for a great exfoliation. I use it in combination with Lush&#x27;s Dark Angel face scrub and it&#x27;s like I am at the spa. My skin feels amazing afterwards and I didn&#x27;t even have to step out of my own bathroom. I have used a few different of these kind of sponges and they are all amazing. If you are looking for a great facial sponge then look no further because you have found the best.</li>
    <li> I started using this 2 weeks ago. I&#x27;ve been hanging it to dry after each day&#x27;s use. There appears to be red and black mold growing inside. I liked the way my skin felt after using it, but will not continue use now.</li>
    <li> I recently posted an article about the Top 5 Beauty Essentials for the Traveling Woman and it included a konjac sponge! This is why! These sponges are incredible to take with you on any trip. It is a reusable sponge that you can use with or without a cleanser to clean your face. What is so great about this sponge is that it is biodegradable, eco-friendly, and vegan! It is not harmful to the environment, which is hard to find in beauty products these days! It removes toxins and impurities, which means YES you can use it to remove your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my face with this sponge, I can immediately feel the different in my skin. It is clean, smooth, and soft! You simply wet the sponge and begin cleaning your face! The sponge is very gentle on your skin, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about irritation or pain while cleaning with it. After you are finished, you can simply hand it on your bathroom for it to dry. The next time you want to use it, it will be as hard as a pumice stone, just like before. Wet the sponge and it works as good as it did before!</li>
    <li> I am really liking this sponge.  I have been using this for about a month and I have to say it does the job well.  I had been using a Buff Puff since I was a teen, but as I am getting older, those got to be a little harsh on my face....even when I used them gingerly.  Although this might not be as exfoliating as some other products out there... it does the job for me... leaving my face clean and fresh while also removing all the oils, makeup, and dirt from the day.&lt;br /&gt;I will note here, the first time I used this sponge I was a bit weirded out by the wet, silky almost slimy feeling it had acquired once I had gotten it wet.  I kept thinking HOW is this actually cleaning my skin?  However, it DID leave my skin clean, and wasn&#x27;t harsh on it at all.  I use a touch of facial cleanser, some warm water, and I wash my face as usual.  Afterward, I make sure to rinse it well and then use the attached loop to hang it dry.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit I am a bit paranoid about the possibility of mold or other things growing on it (it is reusable, but I couldn&#x27;t find anything that said for how long).  As some other reviewers have written,  I make sure to press out as much of the water as I can (you should not wring it out).  It is usually dry by the next evening.  Still, I am going to keep an eye on it to make sure nothing grows... I may try boiling it as well to kill anything that might be in there.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this sponge so far.  It is holding up well and does the job that I intended it to do... get my face clean while also being gentle.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Wonderful product</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome!  It cleans my face so well and is super gentle.  I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> MY Konjac Sponge are made exclusively with the konjac fiber, a pure vegetable fiber taken from the root of the Amorphophallus Konjac plant.&lt;br /&gt;Konjac plant, also known as konnyaku potato or elephant yam, is a plant that is native to eastern Asia.&lt;br /&gt;Konjac root is rich in minerals, vitamins, and it has been traditionally used as a beauty treatment for a long time in eastern Asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year Konjac sponges have been all the rage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once you pick one up and open it, it first comes as this hard piece of weird looking thing. You wonder, “They expect me to use this on my skin?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worry not! These bad boys turn into the softest yet firm piece of material. It just soaks the water up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you’re going to do when you open up the package is get it soaked into some water. It starts to expand into a nice sponge. Not your typical sponge though. It’s almost hard to explain how it feels. It’s almost like a very smooth &amp; soft rubbery feel. In a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it by itself with no cleanser or with cleanser. It’s all up to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s great as an exfoliate. It helps with clearing out your pores and getting that gunk out. It’s cleans your skin so good that your moisturizer just soaks into your skin afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s gentle enough for your whole face and the one I’m using here fits perfectly in my hand to where I can cup it and move it around my face and around my eyes and nose.</li>
    <li> I am hooked.  This is not a harsh sponge and my sensitive skin responds well.  It&#x27;s amazing to see the dead skin come off after having exfoliated.  Using my Thayers alcohol free witch hazel in cucumber, lavedar or rose is great.  My skin if very soft after use.  I try and exfoliate at least 4 times a week.  It&#x27;s amazing how much dirt and dead skin sits on your face.  Exfoliating is such an important part of my skin care process.  It works for me.  Hope it works for you.  THis is what I do.  I wash my face with Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin creamy cleanser with very warm water to open pores.  Then, I soak my KONJAC in a clean clear bowl with hot water and let soak.  I gently rub in circular motion all around my face for a couple of minutes. Put KONJAC sponge back in water and squeeze out access water and you will see all of the dead skin floating in the bowl.  I then splash cold water on my face as this closes the pores and then am ready to apply my toner and moisturizer.  Good luck</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin prone to both dryness and this sponge has worked better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Konjac sponge for a few months now(this is my second one) and absolutely love it.  My skin feels smoother and cleaner.  I also use it on my neck and decolletage have notice an immediate improvement in my skin there as well.</li>
    <li> Love these sponge! In the shower or at the sink, just add water and your favorite cleaner, do a little gentle rubbing and you face feels incredibly clean, fresh and soft. Great for any type of skin - mine is super sensitive, and I have great results without damage. A must have a part of your beauty routine!</li>
    <li> I like it. I thought it might rough on my face, but it was really soft.</li>
    <li> This.sponge was highly recommended by my daughter. I purchased two; one for a gift. Once wet, it is soothing, gentle and the nicest facial product to ever touch my sensitive face. The person that receive the gift sponge feels the same. I have been so impressed that I plan to order the body sponge.</li>
    <li> excellent price for an excellent product</li>
    <li> Love this sponge! It gently exfoliates while leaving a very supple feeling to my skin, not tight and dry like other exfoliatiors. The congestion in my chin is almost completley gone and my skin is glowing. How did I ever wash my face before this sponge?!?</li>
    <li> I bought this face sponge hoping that it would work to lightly exfoliate my very sensitive skin and it does exactly that. It has very little texture, but plenty to wash with daily and it does exfoliate the little that I wanted it to. Very easy to clean and I love the string to hang it to dry after each use. I also love that it is environmentally friendly and cruelty free.</li>
    <li> Great product! Work well!</li>
    <li> So far I like it a lot! Skin feels smooth and clean after use. Very soft on my face and you just need to be gentle in handling it so it doesn&#x27;t rip or tear as another reviewer mentioned it ripped right away.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent sponge makes it easy to clean my face and leaves my skin feeling soft</li>
    <li> I have purchased several Konjac Sponges &amp; love how my face is gently exfoliated, cleansed, &amp; feels so soft. It makes a great gift too..</li>
    <li> I dry, sensitive skin and this is the most gentle, yet effective, exfoliator I have ever used that does not leave my skin reddened. It is very mild but works.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moJLP69RUPDW5X]]I like using sponges to wash my face as well as my body.  The sponges I use on regular basis are made from cellulose (i.e. wood pulp).  Konjac sponge is made from the root of the Konjac plant (which is a potato-like plant). By comparison to a cellulose sponge my Konjac sponge has smaller holes and feels softer and more resilient. I included a photo of the Konjac sponge next to the cellulose sponge in my video, you can see the difference just by looking at them side by side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Konjac sponge feels very soft when wet and very hard when totally dry. It absorbs quite a lot of water. It suds up fairly well. It takes quite a long time to dry.  Out of curious I left one sponge to dry without using it for several days and it took 3 days to totally dry. Each sponge has a string loop that allows you to hang it to dry, which helps to dry it on all sides. Because the sponge is soft it has a fairly limited life span. Based on what I read I expect to get 3 months out it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got 6 different sponges to compare them to each other as it was not clear if they would feel significantly different from each other.  I they feel quite similar to each other in terms of softness and resilience.  I was happy to see that none of them had a scent.  The difference in color comes from what the sponges were injected with, but none of them bleed any colors.  The water runs clear as you can see in my video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Original Pure  Konjac Sponge works on all skin types including very sensitive. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;♦ French Green Clay Konjac sponge is recommended for Oily skin because it absorbs dirt and oil. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Volcanic Scoria Kojac sponge is recommended for mature skin as volcanic scoria supposedly is good for purifying skin. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Red Clay Sponge improves elasticity and texture of the skin. Size: 4.5\\&quot; x 2.5\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;♦ French Pink Clay Konjac sponge is good for dehydrated skin. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Bamboo Charcoal Konjac Sponge is good at gentle exfoliation. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using two sponges on regular basis for about 2 weeks now. I have to say that other than color I am not able to tell the difference between the sponges by either how they feel or by the effects on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges feel pleasant and soft. I like how my face feels after using them. If I have some flaking on my face the sponge removes the loose skin very effectively. Does it reduce the appearance of the pores? I can&#x27;t say I notice any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges are very soft, so they do very gentle exfoliation. If you like the feeling of something rough on your skin this sponge is not going to give you that feeling.  It is very gentle and soft. I think some of the marketing is just marketing (i.e. is a bit exaggerated).  Don&#x27;t expect miracles this is just a nice sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges are provided by Konjac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia reviewSponge is good at gentle exfoliation.

    <li> Really helped to clear up my teen daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin, so my pores are all clogged. This product didn&#x27;t help me, but it might work for someone with normal skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! I love it because everytime i wash my face and neck with it it leaves my skin smooth, clean, velvety and i don&#x27;t need to put any moisturizer on after i use it. Awesome stuff!</li>
    <li> After I cleanse my face I use this to get the residue product off of my face and get the dead skin off of my face. This product works perfectly for both purposes!</li>
    <li> It works great, I use it in the morning prior to putting on makeup. It isn&#x27;t overly drying and will leave your face feeling well balanced and clean.</li>
    <li> My kids love it and fight to wash their faces with my sponge, so their faces are certainly cleaner! If I had bought it for them I&#x27;d be impressed. After hearing reviews I was personally expecting more exfoliation power. Be forewarned, sponges can&#x27;t change your life! It is, however, a practical item, vegetable based, and my face feels pretty clean without cleansers. I have happily added it to my natural facial routine.</li>
    <li> Really excited to use this</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a little harder. I don&#x27;t think it exfoliates as well as I had hoped. My skin is softer after using it. I just wishes the area around my nose was exfoliated better.</li>
    <li> i love this! it makes my face feel really clean and moisturized.  sometimes i use a cleaner with it, sometimes i don&#x27;t. either way its a great product and helps exfoliate while being really gentle. Will probably repurchase when mine wears out.</li>
    <li> I have only used the sponge for a couple of weeks, so far I like it.  It&#x27;s very gentle exfoliation.</li>
    <li> OMG I love this so much. It is the plushest, nicest, best thing I have EVER used on my face. I bought this solely due to all the fantastic reviews. I can&#x27;t even explain how it feels on my face. It is super exfoliating, but it feels like you&#x27;re scrubbing your face with a spongey cloud. You seriously need to try this. I bought the plain white one and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be trying any of the other ones as this works just fine for me. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Does not exfoliate at all - has more of a slick texture when wet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sponge for about 5 months now.  I like the way it makes my skin feel and look.  A little more polished, if you will.  It is very gentle on my mature skin.</li>
    <li> UPDATE - the tiny black spots can appear in 2 to 4 weeks and the dark shadow in about 4 weeks, even with hanging to dry. I still like what they do for my skin, but it gets really expensive replacing a $10 sponge every 2 to 4 weeks. I might try a cheaper brand. In my photos, I can see that the new sponge is crisp and white, whereas the 1-month old sponge has black specs and a dark shadow inside. Yes, I rinse it well every time and hang it up to dry!  OLD REVIEW I&#x27;ve used these for a while now and will continue with them. At first I had trouble with mold growing right away. The hook where I hung it to dry in the shower didn&#x27;t hold it far enough away from the shower wall, so it wasn&#x27;t drying out between uses. I bought an over-the-door hanger to put over the shower enclosure and hang the sponges there. Since then, they&#x27;ve lasted a lot longer before I start to see the dark shadow growing inside. Before trying these sponges, I&#x27;d used Buf-puf. Now Buf-puf feels so rough on my skin! I can&#x27;t go back. When I first used Konjac, I got a lot of skin peeling as all the dead skin started coming off. Now I rarely have any peeling skin. When I do see some flaking, I make a point to scrub longer on that spot, and that will clear up the flakes in a day or two. I wish they were less expensive, but they do last a long time when allowed to dry between uses.</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect with this facial sponge.  I used it the first time and it made my face feel better.  It does not irritate or have any extreme scents that are annoying.  It has a soft texture while scrubbing my face and it seems to clean it very well.  I will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Best facial sponge on the market!!  I can&#x27;t live without one!!!</li>
    <li> I love Konjac spongues and this is the first one ive tried that doesnt have the natural charcoal in it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love love it! makes my face feel SOOOOOO clean!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Leaves skin clean and exfoliated, and glowing. Superb efficiency in shipping/receiving this item as well.</li>
    <li> It feels great, soft and gel like. It gently exfoliate the skin.</li>
    <li> How did I ever live without this sponge? ??&lt;br /&gt;Cleans and unclogs my pores leaving a soft luminous face!!</li>
    <li> LOVE this facial sponge.  Was alittle worried when it got here because it was so hard - but it softens right up in water.  Very soft to use, the texture was different but I love it. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and it seems like it will be very durable.</li>
    <li> Thrilled with my purchase. I use the sponge every other day and my (sensitive, dry, breakout-prone) skin is left soft and smooth without a trace of irritation. After two weeks of use my pores are also much less visible. When researching konjac sponges I read one article suggesting them as a natural (and much more affordable) alternative to sonic cleansing brushes and I have to say I don&#x27;t think a $200 system could do a better job on my skin. I have also purchased the bamboo charcoal sponge which I plan to use when I feel a breakout coming on and I plan to make these sponges part of my skincare routine for years to come.</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like for $10 and it didn&#x27;t get mineral based make-up off. I do feel like it exfoliates pretty well, but I use it after cleansing if I had make-up on. Perfect thing to gently wash your face in the morning!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Cool sponge. Not sure if it helps my skin yet as I&#x27;ve only been using it about a week but its very soft and seems to be gentle on the skin. Different from the abrasive scrubs I&#x27;m used to so its a little getting used to but we shall see how it goes in a month or so. :) I enjoy the texture so far and really like that it&#x27;s from a natural source rather than adding more chemicals to my routine etc.</li>
    <li> Works amazing and no more need to buy face wash.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges!  They are gentle, yet my skin is cleaner and my complection is clearer since using them.  I don&#x27;t know how they clean as well as they do without irritation or dryness.  I&#x27;ve given these to five other people so far and every one of them as reordered.</li>
    <li> What a cool product, love using it!</li>
    <li> I Love it, it&#x27;s so soft, I feel my face softer!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this sponge for about a week. After the very first try  I fell in love with the sponge. When cleaning it gently massages the skin and my skin looks  fresh and younger Just love it!</li>
    <li> This sponge dries quickly and is very effective as a cleanser and exfoliator.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a soft sponge.  Haven&#x27;t noticed anything different on my face.  A Buff Puzz is probably better and much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the original Konjac sponge for 3 months &amp; enjoy it. I cannot say it has been particularly good at &#x27;removing impurities&#x27; or &#x27;exfoliation&#x27;, as some reviewers have claimed. There have been times it has not removed the barest of mineral makeup I wear.&lt;br /&gt;Works well with my cleanser &amp; has held up extremely well with 2x daily use. Overall, pleasant to use, saves on amount of cleanser I need, and non-irritating to my sensitive skin. Easy to care for, a great travel item, and has not discolored as another brand of Konjac sponge I reviewed did after a few weeks use.  I would consider a second purchase of this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple weeks, so I haven&#x27;t noticed a real difference in my skin.  However, I do use it once or twice a day and use it with soap to clean my face.  I was getting sick of constantly buying face cleaner / make-up removers, and I haven&#x27;t yet found a sponge loofa that worked well on my face, but this fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do boil / sterilize it once a week, it hasn&#x27;t crumbled or anything yet, but after only a couple of weeks it is showing a little bit of wear, so it will probably only last about a month or two, however for the price, I&#x27;m ok with replacing it that often.  I&#x27;m hopeful I&#x27;ll see the other benefits of using the konjac sponge, but until then, its great to use as a daily sponge to remove make-up / wash your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really happy with this sponge. It&#x27;s a nice gentle exfoliator and leaves my skin feeling very smooth!  I am definitely going to try some of the other Konjac sponges.</li>
    <li> I use this sponge every night and it makes my face feel so clean! My daughter uses it too. I will have to buy her one for her stocking!</li>
    <li> Great sponge. Beats the pricier types and cruelty free! Will definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I will never go back to using another face scrubber or wash cloth.  Not only does the Konjac Sponge work marvelously without any cleansers (provided you aren&#x27;t wearing makeup, as in first thing in the morning) it tends to amplify the benefits of your cream or foaming face wash.  It leaves my face and neck glowing.  My skin has never been so radiant.</li>
    <li> Love this sponge.  It is gentle enough for eye area but invigorating.  Makes skin feel smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> Its a sponge for your face, which feels less abrasive then using a washcloth or anything else to wash your face. After a week of use (2x a day) my face feels amazing and I&#x27;ve even opted to use less makeup because blemishes and dry-ness are gone. I did have a concern about how long it would last as it is made with plant based products and is hand-made, but the company has amazing customer service and they replied to my concern right away and even sent me a backup! The great customer service definitely makes me love this product even more, but even without it I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I stopped using a washcloth when someone recommended this sponge to me.  It&#x27;s gentle for my sensitive skin, yet strong enough to exfoliate my skin.  I definately suggest trying the konjac sponge to wash your face.</li>
    <li> Love it! My face always feels very refreshed after I use my sponge.</li>
    <li> This is actually the second sponge I&#x27;ve purchased. I love this product! I suffered with acne for 12 years, but the sponge cleansing followed by aloe as a moisturizer has left my face completely clear and glowing!</li>
    <li> Came quickly and seems to be good quality.</li>
    <li> Not sure what the big draw is.  I felt like my skin was cleaner when using a face wash cloth. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this sponge for a few months now and have had no break-outs! I don&#x27;t add a cleanser, I just wet the sponge and it takes all my make-up off and leaves my skin feeling nice and clean.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, acne-prone,and very very dry skin. I have been taking acne medication that dries out my skin completely, and as I&#x27;m recovering from the blemishes I&#x27;ve noticed that it has left me with scars, dark spots, and flaky skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love this sponge because it&#x27;s gentle enough for my sensitive skin and helps get rid of those flakes!! Although my skin is still really dry and will flake throughout the day, this sponge definitely helps in cleaning it up at the end/start of each day.&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to use! I like that it has a string so you can hang-dry it. It&#x27;s also curved on one side to fit the palm of your hand. It helps in cleaning facial makeup off my skin too.</li>
    <li> So far so good! In my experience, Konjacs fall apart really quickly - I haven&#x27;t had the sponge long enough to see exactly when it&#x27;ll fall apart, as that&#x27;s inevitable, but I&#x27;ve had it for two weeks now and it&#x27;s still in great shape. Otherwise it works as well as any other sponge has; lightly exfoliating and toning.</li>
    <li> I was very underwhelmed.  The reviews for this product were so positive that I may have had too high expectations.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t compare to a Clarisonic like some reviews say.  I think you can also get similar results from a good quality BHA or AHA product.</li>
    <li> I have amazon prime so the shipping was supposed to be fast anyway, but I got the sponge even before the 2 days! I got it in 1 day!!!! I think it&#x27;s also because it shipped from California and I live in California, but regardless that made me super happy. So it was a great start. As for the sponge, I love it. I&#x27;ve always wanted to get the clairasonic but it&#x27;s just too expensive. I was highly considering buying that brush before I stumbled upon this through recommendations on YouTube and an article on yahoo. Since it&#x27;s so cheap I decided to go for it and I&#x27;m really glad I did. The texture is so hard to describe because I&#x27;ve never encountered anything like it but when you first get it it&#x27;s really hard and I wondered if it was going to work or not. But you run it under water like it says and it becomes soft and it feels lovely on the skin. I highly recommend to try it because it&#x27;s so inexpensive and it works really well. I take off my foundation/makeup before using it. I use oil and a washcloth. And then when I put my cleanser on this sponge and wash my face the leftover makeup on my face rubs off on the sponge and obviously you can see it haha. So to me that means it works well to clean my face!</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed the sponge quality first week,,,morning &amp; evening...&lt;br /&gt;After that -  sponge seems to have significantly diminished from its original size.</li>
    <li> It may be a bit soon to leave a review as I have only been using it for about a week, but I sincerely like the product and think it will be a &amp;#34;stick to&amp;#34; cleanser for me meaning I will use this and reorder if necessary. Don&#x27;t really know how long they last or continue to do the job. I am amazed that it makes my skin so soft and I have used it strictly without any additional cleansing products so far. I would highly recommend it to anyone and my daughter has used the charcoal sponge for only a week or so and already her complexion is clearing up. Wow. Thanks Konjac.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel nice and clean without being rough or abrasive!</li>
    <li> Soft. Love that it&#x27;s vegan/cruelty-free/plant-based</li>
    <li> Very soft and gentle on skin. If you use a cleanser or scrub on the sponge, it foams up really well, which is great.</li>
    <li> I ordered a Konjac Sponge for my sister for Christmas and one for myself as well. I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase! I have extremely sensitive skin and have been using it everyday. It isn&#x27;t harsh, removes all of my makeup and leaves my skin feeling amazing and looking great. I can&#x27;t wait to order one of the infused sponges for myself and friends. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this sponge! It has been amazing for my skin, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> very happy with these, my daughters love these sponges!</li>
    <li> I use this for physical exfoliation and it seems good without being to harsh on my skin. Very gentle, but since I&#x27;m using active topical creams from the dermatologist my skin peels a lot and sometimes this sponge is too gentle to help remove the dead skin. Also I recommend hanging this sponge in a dry area so it wont collect bacteria from being damp.</li>
    <li> I really liked the teardrop shape but this one didn&#x27;t last very long at all for me. It was used with an oil cleanser and developed a hole in the center within a couple of weeks. Once it got the hole it deteriorated fast. It&#x27;s cheaper than the one I usually get (Boscia) and I like the shape better but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I received the sponge extremely quickly, and now use it everyday in my routine. I use Retin-A, so my skin can get a bit flakey. This helps with the flakiness! It also suds extremely well. It&#x27;s very soft, but a weird texture.</li>
    <li> I only discovered konjac sponges recently in a blog post I was reading.  So I got on Amazon and (no surprise here) found that, yes, they do carry konjac sponges.  So, I ordered one.  I must say I love it.  It is very gentle on my sensitive skin and leaves it soft and smooth.  This will now be a part of my regular skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Far exceeds my expectations. Just what I needed and wanted.</li>
    <li> I had heard good things about the Konjac sponge and wanted to try it out on my dry sensitive skin. I found I really like the sponge, felt it made my skin more polished and even and it shipped very fast. Very pleased all around.</li>
    <li> Great, gentle daily exfoliator! Cheaper than Sephora.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sponge because I felt like I was wasting a lot of my preferred facial cleanser by pumping directly onto my fingers and then washing my face. The sponge is definitely a huge help in that regard; I can use two or three pumps of the bottle now, rather than 10 or 12. This is the first facial sponge I&#x27;ve used, so I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t comment on its plusses and minuses in regard to other sponges, but I like it quite a bit. The size and shape are certainly a huge improvement on a washcloth as far as ease of manipulation and minimizing mess. (I am not particularly graceful.) I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars at present because I&#x27;m not used to the texture yet; it&#x27;s very gentle and I still sort of miss a great sandpapery, scrubby feeling. I know! I&#x27;m nuts.</li>
    <li> I love konjac sponges for daily face cleansing. Care for it properly and it won&#x27;t let you down! I use it with my regular facial cleanser to remove my makeup every night and it works great. It exfoliates very gently with no irritation and get the makeup completely off my skin. You won&#x27;t ever go back to using a washcloth, expensive and environmentally unfriendly cleansing clothes or just water and your hands again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to replace your konjac sponges frequently so that bacteria buildup doesn&#x27;t eventually occur and make you break out.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect but I watched a YouTube video....I&#x27;ve tried a Clarasonic, expensive face cleansers, etc.,but unless my mind is playing tricks on me, my SKIN LOOKS GREAT! Do yourself a favor and just get one of these. The concept is as unique as the sponge itself! I don&#x27;t know how it work, nor do I care as long as I have one of these! I hope it becomes more popular because people really need to try this.</li>
    <li> I received my natural konjac sponge a few days ago and I just love washing my face with it. It&#x27;s hard teardrop shape quickly absorbs water and turns it into a marshmallow texture that thoroughly cleanses with water only or with cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to use it without cleanser just for exfoliation and I follow up with my ABS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have  the My Konjac Sponge French Clay version, which I love but the natural sponge is so much softer that I will be using it on most days.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t try this earlier, my skin has completely changed since I started using it. I use it only in the morning, but it is definitely gentle enough to use twice a day for regular cleansing. It&#x27;s so soft, and so easy on the skin, it leaves no residue and rinses clean. You definitely have to hang it to dry it, but the attached string makes that very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t see myself being without a Konjac sponge in my cleansing routine ever again! Don&#x27;t fall for gimmicks, all konjac sponges will work, don&#x27;t pay the $25 for the ones from the big stores, these work amazingly and you can afford to keep them updated and clean!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product, very very happy.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Intially  I became introduced to the konjac sponge at Sephora and loved it but felt it was a bit pricey at 18 dolllars. I came across this brand on Amazon and it&#x27;s even better for than the brand at Sephora.  For one, it&#x27;s such a good price! Secondly it&#x27;s almost 2 and a half times the size which is nice because you can cover more surface area and clean your face more efficiently. Also the teardrop convex  shape of this brand is very cool. Much easier to handle so you don&#x27;t drop it in the shower!</li>
    <li> 10/10 would recommend</li>
    <li> The sponge works great, and it turns every shower into a mini-facial. I have sensitive skin, and the sponge cleans well. I just rinse the sponge to soften it, and then rub it all over my face and neck. I swear my skin glows afterwards!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of them. I keep one in the shower and another one in the medicine cabinet. I absolutely love how my skin feels now. Soft, radiant and smooth! Excellent products and fantastic seller.</li>
    <li> Loved it, best face purchase ever.</li>
    <li> Love this sponge! Makes my skin feel clean while being very gentle! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Had this sponge for about 2 weeks now and I love it! My skin feels softer and seems brighter than it has in a very long time!</li>
    <li> You wonder why most Korean women have beautiful soft skin~Because unlike in America where we think going more rough on our skin will clean out pores and remove all makeup... but I heard that it is more safe for your skin to go more soft but cleanse twice~ Ever since... my skin has completely cleared up and feels soft without the irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget the $200 Clarisonic Brush~ My sensitive skin LOVES this all natural sponge~ It cleans perfectly leaving my skin soft and squeaky clean without the irritation~ Using it softer or more rough around my blackheads never broke out my skin like the Brushes does. Will continue using this~~~</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I have extremely sensitive skin which is also oily (combination), so I get clogged pores all the time. I can&#x27;t exfoliate because scrubs and acids are too harsh and leave my skin a red/irritated. But this Konjac sponge is amazing! It is so gentle that it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all, yet it cleans and exfoliates very well leaving my skin soft and clear. I&#x27;ve been using it every night for a few days and no complaints. Best sponge by far, I highly recommend to my readers!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this - Lifelong customer right here!</li>
    <li> This sponge is great for gentle physical exfoliation.  Plus it&#x27;s easy to clean after use!  I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a month and it&#x27;s as good as the day I got it!  No sign of wear.</li>
    <li> Works great for teen skin. Love that you can use your own preferred skin cleanser!</li>
    <li> Really amazing feeling sponge material, love cleaning my face everyday with it.. and hang to dry.. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy it!&lt;br /&gt;Very recommended</li>
    <li> This makes my skin tingle and feel so clean I love it! And am in need of a new one haha will be ordering soon</li>
    <li> I have been using my Konjac for about a month now. At first I felt that it did a nice job cleaning my skin and helping exfoliate. But, about 3 weeks in my skin started to become very oily and yesterday morning I started to break out. Today my face looks and feels horrible. (Side note: This break out does NOT coincide with my menstrual cycle.)  I don&#x27;t think I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Use it daily, sometimes with and sometimes without, a gentle cleanser.</li>
    <li> Considering this is my first Amazon review of a product, that shows how disappointed I am from this sponge. I just bought this sponge this week and after the second use it ripped! From the reviews I expected more from this product.</li>
    <li> ive only used it twice so far but my face feels smoother already</li>
    <li> My kids and I LOVE these sponges. We all got one. We all have combination, sensitive skin, and these have been great. I use a drop or two of skin cleanser (pick your favorite) after the sponge is wet and squishy,  massage is around my face, and rinse. Make sure you rinse the sponge well, but be careful to sqeeze it gently to get all the water out but not damage it. My younger daughter just plain loves the feeling of the sponge, and has asked me to buy her one just for the shower. As for its efficacy, my skin feels cleaner, with less dry skin. Also, my skin seems to absorb my lotion better. I&#x27;m so glad I found these!</li>
    <li> The first one I purchased was great. The second one though was not as dense and tore around the string area. It still worked well, but it was hollow in some places unlike the first sponge.</li>
    <li> Exactly the same as the $20 Sephora version. Not too harsh on your skin so it can be used daily to exfoliate. Love it!</li>
    <li> Better than a,washcloth, your hands or honestly anything. It feels so good,on the face and after,a,week my face felt and looked smoother.</li>
    <li> My wife seems to like your product very much.</li>
    <li> Love this thing !! It&#x27;s just so cool and it works !!! It was highly recommended so I decided to buy and so glad I did. It leaves my skin looking amazing ! Thank you for a great product !</li>
    <li> Really nice soft sponge.  I got it to be gentle around an injury - it is uniquely soft and feels great.</li>
    <li> I truly love this sponge.  I have very sensitive skin and this sponge feels wonderful</li>
    <li> My wife is the one in the family who knows her stuff when it comes to skincare, while I&#x27;m the one who benefits. This thing feels amazing and makes me look forward to starting off the day&#x27;s skincare routine she lays out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely not a substitute for my Clairsonic.  Pretty soft sponge.  Buff puffs are much more effective.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It feels so good on my face, and it doesn&#x27;t put nearly as much pressure when washing as my hands do. I use it twice a day and I microwave it with water to sterilize it every other day. The string is getting a little worn out but the sponge is still staying strong! I&#x27;ve owned it for almost a month now.</li>
    <li> I am loving this sponge so far.  It leaves my face feeling clean and I love that it is all natural.</li>
    <li> The surface of this sponge is quite soft and smooth, so I don&#x27;t find it useful for thorough or deep cleansing (removal of my zinc oxide sunscreen or makeup, for example). Most important: Not good for any appreciable exfoliation, as I&#x27;d hoped it would be. Unfortunately I&#x27;ve returned to using my exfoliation cloth, although this is exactly what I had hoped to replace. Sometimes I use this sponge as a buffer / extra bulk with my exfoliation cloth wrapped around it. The very thin hanging string didn&#x27;t allow for quick / easy handling, and ripped through the tip of the sponge pretty easily after a couple weeks of use.</li>
    <li> The Organic Pure has worked out great on my sensitive skin that breaks out from everything, from soap, to make-up, to moisturizer. Even a washcloth makes my face red for an hour after using it. I have used the Organic Pure several times now and there has been no redness and my super dry skin is softer and looks healthier than it has in ages! Thank you MY Konjac Sponge for going that extra mile!!!!</li>
    <li> Cleans well and it&#x27;s very soft on my skin. I suffer from acne and it does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> bought for my wife and she loves it.  thanks for offering such a great product.  will surely be back again.</li>
    <li> Konjac sponges are my new favorite way to cleanse and exfoliate my face. At the moment I am using two different sponges, so each has the chance to thoroughly dry between use. (Just mentioning in case any of you are wondering why I posted two different Konjac Sponge reviews within the past couple weeks).  I have been using a Konjac sponge daily for several weeks now. My skin has been very soft and smooth and my occasional breakouts have been clearing up faster than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the konjac sponge to be very gentle yet effective for cleansing. Sometimes I even use it to remove mascara with no irritation (usually I use a little coconut oil to remove makeup first). I usually do not like physical exfoliation on the face such as scrubs or luffas. I find them too abrasive and irritating. I certainly would not use a physical exfoliate daily. Not the case with the Konjac sponge. It exfoliates very gently, it almost feels like a mild massage. As I clean, I can see the sponge absorb my makeup. I thoroughly rinse after use and squeeze the water from the sponge than hang it to dry. I think it is important to keep sponges clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Konjac Sponge is a similar size to the palm of my hand. It is about four inches long, three inches wise and about one inch thick (when dry).  I feel it is a good size for a facial sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received My Konjac Sponge free of charge in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Fun novelty item. Mine lasted a couple months before falling apart. Would use it during my morning shower. Great texture. Not sure if I&#x27;ll bother getting another one.</li>
    <li> Im very pleased with the results of using the Konjac sponge for the past two weeks.  Although it is a soft sponge it seems to exfoliate the dead skin cells well.  My complexion is improving each day of use.</li>
    <li> Great product. My skin looks very nice!</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this sponge didn&#x27;t irritate it at all. It&#x27;s really gentle and leaves my skin smooth. Love using this when I wash my face at night.</li>
    <li> Best facial sponge I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I like the sponge. It arrives stiff and hard, but as soon as you get it wet it becomes very soft and very gentle on the skin. I like it and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and would definitely purchase it again.  It feels wonderful and does a great job gently exfoliating my skin.  I have never used anything better.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. Wishes I had bought it ten years earlier.</li>
