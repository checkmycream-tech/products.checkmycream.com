<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was given a gel kit for Christmas last year and went online to purchase a light. There were so many options and prices ranging from $20-250+ for UV and LED lights. After reading reviews and researching the options I decided to get this particular light. After using it for about 4 months here&#x27;s what I think of it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;  -Convenience: I was hooked on being to cure both my hands at once. I am already annoyed that I have to take off my old polish one hand at a time, I don&#x27;t think I could handle having to cure and hand at a time also (except maybe with a quick curing LED).&lt;br /&gt;  -Wattage: I&#x27;ve seen UV lamps with wattage as low as 9 and as high as about 54. This lamp is 45 watts, which seems powerful enough to accomplish what I want.&lt;br /&gt;  -Settings: I use the 2 minute setting for everything and I&#x27;ve never had any problems. There&#x27;s also a 3 minute and continuous setting. I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to look at the clock or set a stopwatch to time myself.&lt;br /&gt;  -Price: After spending a few hours researching these lamps I realized this is probably has the best features for the price. There are models from $20 up to about $300 (LED usually), this seemed to have everything I need for about $50. That&#x27;s just a little over the price of one gel manicure at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;  -Works with all my polish: I mostly have Gelish prodcuts, but also bought Red Carpet and FingerPaints products, which cure equally as well under this light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  -UV vs LED: In hindsight I wish I would&#x27;ve sprung for a LED light. The bulbs last much longer, there&#x27;s no cancer causing UV rays and the drying time is much quicker. The better LED lights are $60+, but I did see one that got pretty good reviews for about $33. The lower priced LED lamps generally only do one hand at a time, up to 4 fingers at a time (thumb separate). I&#x27;m not entirely sure if I&#x27;d be happy having to put my hand under a lamp 4 times for each coat of polish I do, even if it&#x27;s for less time. The LED I want is $270 and does one whole hand at a time, 30 seconds each coat. Now that I&#x27;ve grown to love and rely on my gel manicures I know it&#x27;s probably going to eventually be worth the extra investment.&lt;br /&gt;  -Bulbs: I can&#x27;t say exactly how long these bulbs will last, but the replacements are sure pricey. I looked it up and each bulb is right now $11.21, so the cost of 3 new bulbs will be $33.63. This is just a quick Amazon search, I didn&#x27;t do any major price comparisons. That&#x27;s not much cheaper than the cost of the whole unit plus bulbs. I think when I get to the point of needing to replace them I will be giving my unit away and upgrading to my desired LED dyer.&lt;br /&gt;  -Size: Both a positive and negative, yes, you can dry both hands at once, but this thing is pretty big to store. If you are short on space this might not be the best option out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I&#x27;m not unhappy with my purchase and am giving 4 stars for &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34;. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like doing my own manicures or if I would do it a couple times and would get bored of it, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a light. Now that I know I&#x27;m going to be doing my own gel manicures for years to come, I will eventually upgrade. For anyone who wants a relatively inexpensive, larger, 2 handed UV lamp, I definitely recommend this unit. If you have the cash to spend it might be better just to initially go with the LED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I did end up getting the Gelish light for about $200. I wish I would&#x27;ve got it so much sooner! This UV light did serve me well, but when I got my LED I was in heaven. Now repairing a nail is a breeze and do nail art since it cures so quickly. The times for that are: base coat 5 seconds, color 20-30 seconds, top coat 30 seconds. I also like doing one hand at a time so much more. I can scrape the extra paint off with my opposite hand. If you think you&#x27;re going to be doing gel for a long time I recommend splurging for the better light. Igave this away and it&#x27;s still going strong though.</li>
    <li> My wife hated it...they dont dry as quick as advertised plus it&#x27;s very hard to clean the gel at the borders of the nail. Colors are misleading also.</li>
    <li> Great quailty, came just as described. A great buy.</li>
    <li> Had a smaller UV Gel Nail Dryer that did not dry as well.  This one drys my nails in a short span of time and keeps them dry.</li>
    <li> The light were no good.  We had to hit the machine to get the lights on&lt;br /&gt;it was too much hassle to return it and we ended up keeping  in  storage.</li>
    <li> I like it, but the bulbs are always loose and go on and off.  I&#x27;m constantly having to work with them!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Powerful enough to use with CND Shellac&lt;br /&gt;Two hand size saves tons of time when doing self manicures&lt;br /&gt;Reflective interior helps insure an even dry&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Has a timer (which helps more than you&#x27;d think)&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install/replace bulbs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to touch back bulb with nails if you&#x27;re not careful&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes necessary to \\&quot;cook\\&quot; base coat a little longer while the lamp heats up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with purchase and very glad I didn&#x27;t buy the $120 lamp</li>
    <li> My wife loved the shellac process we bought an additional dryer so my daughter would not have to transport hers from her house to ours</li>
    <li> The wife loves it period. She can cure her nails on both hands at the same time and it actually works saving me money on going to a salon. Excellent product hands down</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble and my gel polish cured perfect! Its dumb that they require you to type more words than this because what else can you say about a uv light?</li>
    <li> Have been enjoying doing nails at home...works good...but...the bulbs WILL NOT stay in place...that&#x27;s a pain!&lt;br /&gt;The packaging appeared as if it had been opened and possibly sent back?</li>
    <li> Works great! I was a little hesitant to but it because I had never heard of the brand but it is awesome.</li>
    <li> I just received my dryer yesterday and I used it for the first time. It only took two minutes to dry each layer. My nails look great! No more spending $60 at the salon every 2 weeks!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a decent amount of time before writing a review on this product and a year is probably pretty good haha. This lamp is awesome. It is large enough to cure both hands and then both feet at the same time. I have used it probably every week for a year now and have absolutely no issues. The bulbs all still work great. Very impressed. Especially for the price. Just follow all your gel nail polish instructions and you will have no problems. And also remember that your nails with always remain tacky until the last step of top coat polish and then once you wipe with alcohol they will be perfect and shiny.  UPDATE: It&#x27;s been almost 2 and a half years and this light is still going strong! Still use it every 2 weeks for my nails.</li>
    <li> Easy to set up, works perfectly fine. I use it with my gelish kit... Need to purchase those hand protectors since the UV light exposure isn&#x27;t such a good thing for hands. Glad I picked this lamp because it fits both of my hands or feet for quicker results...</li>
    <li> Horrible light. Cheap. I broke after only two uses and even those uses were not flawless. I&#x27;m not happy with this light.</li>
    <li> This works very well.  Mine came with a light bulb that didn&#x27;t work, but I was able to pick one up for only $8.00 at a nail store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a long time now and love it!  I do my own shellac nails and toenails and it works great!  Love the size because you can do two hands (or both feet) at once.</li>
    <li> I got it when I needed it. thank you. It dried shellac polish well, the top coat didn&#x27;t dry too fast but I think its because I wiped the tacky layer off the color to do nail art prior to the top coat. next time il try to do the art on the tacky later.</li>
    <li> it has a tab that hangs down and if not careful will mess up nails when putting hands in</li>
    <li> Every bit as good as the CND dryer AND I get BOTH of my hands in it.  Win.</li>
    <li> Perfect for shellac nails.  The price is way less than the CND uv light and it works perfect for the shellac nails.  I like the double size too.  No instructions were included.  It was helpful to read the reviews as they included helpful tips!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my nail dryer.  I am using for the CND gel nails.  I did take a bulb out to lower the wattage.  My gels have been chipping sooner that expected and wondered if maybe they were curing too fast with all 3 bulbs.  Dryer is great, just trying to work out the kinks of the gel nails</li>
    <li> I bought this gel dryer after reading several reviews online.  Initially, I was going to purchase the normal gel dryer for an individual hand.  After comparing the price difference between a single and double, I chose the double.  I am very pleased with its performance.</li>
    <li> I love the OPI Axium/Shellac/ gel nail polishes.  I decided it was cheaper in the long run to buy my own supplies rather than getting my nails done.  This worked just fine.  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I made the decision to purchase this product; it has already paid for itself since I can now do my nails at home! I really like the timer feature and find that it works well with my gel polishes.  One thing to make note of, if you are not using a gel sealing top coat, you will need to keep your nails under the lights for much longer than 2-3 minutes, perhaps 6-8 minutes or longer.  I highly recommend getting a gel sealing top coat, specifically made for uv lights as this will speed up drying and hardening.  If you are thinking of getting this, and know the benefits of using a uv light, you won&#x27;t regret it! I got the 45 watt uv dryer and it is awesome! Soooo worth the price!</li>
    <li> I received this unit this week and thought GREAT, I can do my nails now! I got set up today - took everything out of the boxes, viewed the DVDs on how to do Gel nails myself, tested the unit and was good to go. I got the bonder for the gel&#x27;s cured and then the unit died. No power, nothing, nada, zilch. Had power from the plug to the the unit, but nothing from the unit. Great. I don&#x27;t think I will recommend this.</li>
    <li> The product arrived fast and i was very exited to use it. I found out that one of the bulbs were broken. It hasnt been replaced and i havent used my dryer. I am beyond mad. It is just sitting in my closet now.</li>
    <li> Perfect for shellac and Gelish.  Both hands fit in at once which i didn&#x27;t expect it to be that  big, but saves time... I even opened an amazon charge and saved $30.00!</li>
    <li> This is the same lamp my manicurist uses for my gel nails.  After spending way too much getting these $30+ gel nails, I decided that it looked as simple as polishing nails.&lt;br /&gt;Did my gel nails for the first time last night and they turned out great.  The lamp worked perfectly and I am very happy with this purchase, and the price is amazing!</li>
    <li> I was nervous - but I bout 4 CND colors and the top and base coat and this dryer - and followed the instructions left here by another reviewer.  (1 min under lamp for base, 3 minutes each color coat and 3 minutes top coat, wipe with 91% alcohol on a pad to remove tackiness)  Perfect, beautiful salon nails!!  Not trilled with the color Negligee - it is not as advertised - it is instead a very very very sheer shell pink. Almost nude. But still love the results.   Highly recommended. Will save BIG $ now :)</li>
    <li> I really love the \\&quot;largeness\\&quot; of this UV light - I love how it accommodates two feet or hands.  I would give this product 5 stars, but it lacks a minute timer (minimum is two minutes) and the bulbs fit loose (which causes flickering).  In the end, the pros outweigh the cons - it is easy to use my phone for a minute timer and it is easy enough to push the loose bulbs in.</li>
    <li> This is not a good macine for curing gel nail polish.  Lights turn off constantly and do not cure the nail polish (I used Gelish).  Spent an hour and the polish never cured.  I ended up taking it off.</li>
    <li> Just got it in the mail Saturday, popped it open and used it instantly! I love it! It cured extremely fast and it doesn&#x27;t burn. Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> Great product!  No need to pay the expensive salon manicure prices.  This is great for doing at home in the privacy of your own home.  The first review by Stephanie Hodges(Arbonne Girl)helped me bunches!  Did each step the way she said to and my nails came out looking just like I had them done in the salon.  No more salon trips for me!  Thank you Lord!!!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t be the price. Works great for nail drying when I do my Shellac or Gel nail polish. Has a button for continuous, 2 minutes and 3. I have had it since the summer and still works like new. No problems. There is no need to pay double for a lamp that does the same thing the others do.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I purchased this dryer.  And so far, so good.  It was easy to get the bulbs in, and it seems to work well and quickly.  Another reviewer, Arbonne Girl, provides great step-by-step instructions for getting the polish on.  I followed her suggestions exactly and ended up with a terrific looking manicure.  I thought I&#x27;d provide some suggestions for removal, as I saw some reviewers said they were having trouble getting the polish off. So try this:  1.  Use a nail buffing block (medium/medium fine grit) and buff the shine off of your nails.  2.  Cut 10 small pieces of cotton and 10 squares of tin foil.  Saturate the cotton with acetone and place a piece on each nail, then wrap with the tin foil.  Let the cotton/foil sit on your nails for a couple of minutes.  3.  Remove one cotton/foil at a time and lightly scrape the polish from the nail.  This is going to seem random, but I happened to have a metal dog dental tooth scaler (also purchased from Amazon), and it worked perfectly to scrape the loose polish off my nails.  Now I just have to get a new scaler for my dog&#x27;s teeth :).  4.  Use one of the pieces of cotton to clean off any bits of remaining polish.</li>
    <li> The Thermal Spa uv/gel light nail dryer may be a decent product. The position of the bulbs are good it would probably get the job done if it shows up in one piece. The light itself had no padding in the box it arrived in. So when the outter box is banged up and then the inner box has no padding for the light unit, I was not surprised when it didn&#x27;t work. It did work for one 3 minute cycle and then it would not come back on. There were no directions in the manufactures box. You don&#x27;t need them to figure things out but it would have been nice. Some one in packaging was obviously in a rush. I sent it back and won&#x27;t buy another on line.</li>
    <li> The salon said you could not get the stuff to do shellac at home and had to have it done professionally. I went home and amazon&#x27;d \\&quot;shellac\\&quot;, bought all the stuff to do it at home including this light, and it worked perfectly :)</li>
    <li> Discovered Shellac at the salon, and after doing some research - realized I can do it at home.  This light works great with the CND shellac product. I was a little nervous because it wasn&#x27;t CND brand but it works great!  Great price.</li>
    <li> Purchased the whole set for Christmas Gift and so far wifey used it once and no problem with this item.  ALTHOUGH it nails did start chipping off easily after 5-6 days!!</li>
    <li> I used this light yesterday for my first ever at-home gel manicure.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting such amazing results.  After reading other reviews for at-home gel mani&#x27;s, I was kind of nervous to try it myself but my nails look like I had them done in the salon. If you do the proper prep work, the application was a snap and with this light, you can do both hands at once, which is a real advantage over the smaller portable lights.  I did 3 minutes per step (using the Red Carpet Manicure products) and I swear I will never go back to a salon.  The light and gel products will pay for themselves after just 3 manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had tried this sooner!</li>
    <li> Ok, I am the type of girl who is extremely active (and extremely frugal).  I have never been able to keep a regular manicure looking decent for more than a day and a half, and I&#x27;m not the type to rock the acrylic or gel nails. As I wanted to have a more polished appearance at work, when my local spa started offering Shellac nail services, I thought this would be a great alternative for me.  I was informed that shellac is extremely durable and as easy to put on as regular nail polish (none of that smelly acrylic or gel stuff for me!), but I was put off by the $45.00 price tag for the initial service and the need for return visits every 2-3 weeks for the upkeep (I work full time and go to school part time and have difficulty committing to regular spa visits both because of time constraints and the costs involved). The technician at the spa said that this services could only be done by professionals, and that the required supplies could not be purchased by mere mortals such as myself.  As a perpetual skeptic, I figured that a little research was in order. I was pleased to discover that Amazon carried all the supplies I needed to perform this service at home.  During my research, I visited the CND Shellac website, where they recommend their own U/V nail dryer for use with their shellac.  After more research, I decided to save myself a considerable amount of money and purchased the Thermal Spa 49135 U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer from Amazon.  I also purchased the CND Shellac U/V top coat, CND base coat, and the CND Shellac in Cocoa - all through Amazon.  At this point I need to qualify this review with the following:  I am, by no means, a professional nail technician.  In fact, I just started doing my own manicures very recently (have been doing my own pedicures for the past year or so), and have no special skills other than a steady hand, patience, and the ability to follow directions.  The CND Shellac system is as easy to use as putting on nail polish, although you must follow ALL the directions on the bottles regarding curing times, etc., and the Thermal Spa U/V Nail Dryer worked beautifully to cure the CND product!  I was a slightly nervous when my nails came out a little tacky at the end, but, once I removed this tacky layer with the alcohol, per the instruction on the top coat package, I was AMAZED at the results.  The Thermal Spa dryer definitely worked as promised on the CND product for a fraction of the cost of the CND U/V nail dryer.  Now the for the caveats.  The initial investment was pricey (I paid roughly 125.00 for the nail dryer and the CND base coat, CND top coat and CND Shellac), but I figure I&#x27;ll make most of my money back after the second use.  Not a bad ROI.  Next, the manicure process may be a bit more time-consuming than a regular manicure, due to the curing time required for the product, but really is no more difficult to perform than painting one&#x27;s nails with regular polish.  It is IMPERATIVE that you follow the directions when using the shellac products, but, if you do, you can end up with results that look fabulous for a fraction of the cost of a spa visit.  Bottom line, save yourself some money - this Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer works wonderfully with the CND Shellac products.</li>
    <li> Used this thing one time and then it completely shorted out.  Do not buy this!!!  I am super frustrated -- it died halfway through a manicure on my daughter.</li>
    <li> With working and running to get my nails done every two weeks, i have decided to shellac my own nails at home.  This nail dryer works great.  It was easy to install the bulbs and is not too bulky.  Considering some of these dryers are so expensive, I went for middle of the road price and am glad I chose this product.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product and returned it after a couple of tries. It didn&#x27;t work as it was described.</li>
    <li> The Thermal Spa 49135 U/V Nail Dryer is such a convenience and it requires less trips to a nail salon.  And, you can use it for regular nail polish too (not just gelish types)!!  I abolutely love it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The Thermal Spa Nail Dryer works just like the ones at the salon. I haven&#x27;t had any issues and have used it several times. If you use it for shellac or gel polish follow the instructions the the brand of polish (all can be found on the professional brand&#x27;s websites) and they will last the 14+ days. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase and saves me a ton of money from going to the salon!</li>
    <li> I started doing my own gel nails after watching a few you-tube videos.  After I bought this dryer, I started doing my sisters nails as well. They loved it, and bought themselves this dryer as well.  We all do our own nails now and love to compare colors, trade tips on colors and drying, etc.  The worst thing thing about paying $40 for a reg. manicure was leaving the shop with wet nails.  This product was like a bright star!  Love it.  Over 1 year later, still going strong.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before purchasing this product and here is my review... I had no issue installing the lamp, it was quite simple to insert them correctly.  I used gelish polish with the lamp.  The timer made it easy to watch a TV show while waiting for the curing process to complete, which was a short 2-3 minutes anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I cured the base coat for a few seconds, each coat of the polish for two minutes and the top coat for three minutes.  My nails came out perfectly dry, even and super shiny.  This is the first time I am using the product so after  a few more tries with the system I will update my review. All in all, very easy to \\&quot;install\\&quot; and use.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so bummed!  I purchased this unit and was really excited to do my nails, as a number of my friends have used the Gelish system and it looks great.  However, this unit was supposed to come with 3 UV lights and didn&#x27;t.  Then, I purchased, separately, 3 UV lights, and they don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had an issue with anything I&#x27;ve purchased through Amazon before, so not sure what happened this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t contact the company that sold me this product (Minterex). Unsure what to do at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I used my Thermal Spa for the first time using Gelish polish.  It worked GREAT!  Now I have a beautiful, strong manicure that will last for at least 2 weeks.  In just a few uses, I will have paid for the unit in savings from what my local nail place charges for the same thing.  I have used Amazon for years and they are also the best online shopping site!!</li>
    <li> I was going to buy an LED lamp, but the reviews here on amazon for those have been faked.  SO, I decided to buy this UV lamp for my Gelish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it a few days before the polish arrived, and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it, all the bulbs were neatly packed in the bottom of the box, and weren&#x27;t too difficult to click into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it 3 times, once for each of my hands (separately) and I did my daughters hands (at the same time)&lt;br /&gt;Just 1 minute for each layer of Gelish, the top it off needs 2 minutes.  All cured perfectly!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made of plastic, not metal as in the item description.</li>
    <li> I bought this item and I&#x27;ve used it twice so far. It is a great product and works just like it says. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly! No complaints here!</li>
    <li> I have now used it 5 times...and really appreciate that I can place 2 hands in at the same time.  And it is not too big, so that I can place it in a cabinet when not in use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife to use in her salon. The photos on the internet will deceive you. This item is large and it fits both hands or feet comfortably. The craftsmanship is excellent and it really is value for money. She is happy with it and her clients enjoy using it.  Simply fantastic!</li>
    <li> I purchased this light specifically to do my own Shellac nails. The light arrived promptly, and appears to be in working order. Although I almost threw out the light bulbs because they are at the bottom of the box, under a piece of cardboard- so you do not know they are there. After going to multiple stores looking for these specialty bulbs (no sucess), thankfully I read a review that indicated where the bulbs are in the box. As for my Shellac nails, they are chipping within a couple days (compared to staying solid for almost 2 wks when having them done at the salon). It&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s my error, so I am not going to blame this device (but I do have the step by step instructions on the Shellac process, and all required products, so I can&#x27;t imagine where I would be going wrong). Also, this device is huge!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this unit and could not be more happier with it. I use it primarily for my shellac nail services. The dryer works great! I love that it has room for both hands to fit in. It is a stronger uv than most. After researching for a while on the internet I chose this dryer for the price and so happy I did. Other cnd dryers are more expensive and not worth the price difference. After using a CND dryer for a year prior, I see no reason for the expensive price put on them. I highly suggest this dryer if any one needs a good shellac or gel dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not typically one to write a product review but I found all of the other reviews so helpful on this product - the reviews are the reason I chose this lamp.    I have used this lamp with the Shellac nail polish system and IT WORKS LIKE YOU GOT THEM DONE AT THE SALON!  I have chosen this lamp with no regrets for the following reasons:  1. This lamp has enough watts to cure the Shellac polish - even more watts that some of the more expensive name brand lamps.  2. This lamp has enough room to cure your entire hand/foot or both hands/feet, including the thumbs - the name brands OPI and Brisa only have room for four fingers at a time and then your thumb by itself.  3. The price of this lamp is half the price of the name brand lamps.  4. This lamp is easy to use, it has a 2 minute setting, a 3 minute setting, and a continuous setting. (Shellac system uses the 2 minute setting.)    I recommend going to the Shellac website and printing off the instructions on how to use the nail polish with your lamp; the instructions include a last step after your top coat sealer requiring alcohol.  I believe the instructions recommend using a 90% alcohol but I have used the $1 bottle of generic rubbing alcohol (70%?) at Wal-mart and it cures the nails just fine - they are not tacky after this last very important step.    I have not used any of the other brands of nail polish with this lamp - I am looking forward to trying the OPI Axxium and Harmony Gelish with it soon!  THIS LAMP WORKS WITH THE CDI SHELLAC NAIL POLISH SYSTEM!!</li>
    <li> I really like this U.V. light quite well. It works on all gel products I&#x27;ve used so far and is wide enough for two hands or feet. I feel it was a great buy at a great price.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping it would work after reading all the reviews and unfortunately after repeated attempts, my nails begin to pull back from the edges every time after only a few days.  I know I am applying the polish correctly ...would use the CND lamp if you want to be sure you are doing it right.  Asked for a refund and have not heard back from seller.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this uv light.  I was researching UV lights for a long time before making the decision to purchase this one.  I am so glad I decided on this product!  It works great on BRISA uv gel products! I am not sure what the girl reviewing this product below was doing wrong but this light has the power to cure my gels just like the salon! (just be sure to buy the glue drying spray and spray each nail after 2 - 3 mins of curing and then wipe nails with cotton square soaked in acetone before filing/buffing).  My nails look so great! I wish I made this purchase sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint was no instructions were included but if you&#x27;ve had your nails done at the salon a few times you will be able to figure it out. I am so excited to try this product with the colored gel products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this light; it won&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
    <li> I used this UV light dryer for 10 seconds on my CND base coat, then 2 minutes for each coat of CND \\&quot;Red Baroness\\&quot; shellac, and finally 2 minutes for my CND top coat - and my results are amazing!!!  I am throwing away every bottle of traditional nail polish I own and will only paint my nails with Shellac from now on.</li>
    <li> I bought this to cure the \\&quot;Shellac\\&quot; nail polish system at home. It does a great job! I can easily fit both hands into the unit at once, and the timer buttons (located on the top front) are easy to use. The unit cured the polish beautifully! This unit was $100 less expensive than the CND/Shellac branded dryer!</li>
    <li> Would like to know about replacement, not acting correctly</li>
    <li> Is fantastic, thank to this product my nails are not messed up any more. Cure my nails in minutes. The only problem is that is too big, but you can put both hands at the same time. Is really light and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I had this thermal spa led lamp for over two years! I love it!!! I also can do my toe nails too! Love love love it! The only thing is that it DOES get HOT and you HAVE got to put SUNSCREEN on! It&#x27;s very important to your skin!!!</li>
    <li> Works really great for my salon. I bought a different one on amazon and that one sucks, but this one is great!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this light to cure my shellac nail polishes! Works great.....Has nice timer settings for 2,3 and continuous minutes. Easy to set up and get going!</li>
    <li> Update...Buyer Beware! I purchased this product and after 9 months it stopped working I contacted the seller NailBeauty4U to inquire about replacing the lamps they were not at all helpful. I did find out that Thermal Spa garantees the product for 1 year and will replace it for you if you return it to them.    Has anyone experienced problems with their shellac nails? I followed all the directions and  my nails are lifting and peeling off after a few days they don&#x27;t chip but I can pull off half or the whole covering. I do put my hands in water a lot but others have told me they do also and their nails are not peeling off and last 2-3 weeks. What am I doing wrong any advice would be appreciated. I have also used gloves and they lasted about a week before they started to lift on the sides.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Works great, just like salon!</li>
    <li> Great replacement for my 9 watt lamp, cures much faster too and it was such a bargain! I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> My husband has been battling toenail fungus for a while now.  We&#x27;ve tried doctor-prescribed pills and then found out that those damage the liver.  We&#x27;ve been sunning our toes out on the patio, but the weather has gotten too cold for that.  For only 10 minutes a day, this little machine does the same thing and does it well.  It is also nice if you do your own fake nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but I relied heavily on the reviews about this UV lamp when I was shopping, so now feel a need to contribute. This light is fabulous. light weight but not cheap. I used it with Shellac CND polish. The first time I have ever tried anything like this... I&#x27;m a total novice, and I was surprised how beautifully the process went. I have large hands and long fingers, so it&#x27;s nice to have plenty of room and this lamp saves time because I can put both feet in it at once. Don&#x27;t hesitate on this lamp it&#x27;s great and a good value,  it pays for itself in just a couple of manicures. In my area salons charge $35.00 for a Shellac manicure. The tip and travel time make it work for me. I found several great instruction on you tube giving instructions on how to do the job well. Remember your nails will feel a little tacky until the end when you should use alcohol to remove the residue. Good Luck. The lamp works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp to use with my Gelish nail products.  It works great and there is room to dry both hands or feet at the same time.  The cost was reasonable and I will save so much money doing my own nails.  I was nervous about doing my own gel polish - but my nails look just as good as at the salon AND I was able to do my feet which they don&#x27;t offer at my salon...  GREAT PRODUCT... The bulbs are packaged at the bottom of the box, so I almost missed them... (I think they should put them on top or put a note on the packaging).  I used a base and top coat along with 3 coats of colored polish and got professional results.  I used the 3 min timer just to be sure I was curing my nails long enough because I was worried about the tacky feeling.  The alcohol removed the tacky feeling immediately so I will try the 2 minute next time and see if the results are the same.  The hardest part is keeping the polish away from the sides of my nails, I ended up with a little extra polish on the sides of a few nails that I had to file away and re-seal with the top coat, so next time I will try to be a little neater. :0)  After watching a few more tutorials online and buying the right colors of polish, I plan to tackle the french manicure next time - wish me luck LOL...</li>
    <li> Been doing my own gel manicures for 2 years. this is the 3rd light I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s sturdy, lights don&#x27;t wiggle around&lt;br /&gt;- 2 min timer for standard set&lt;br /&gt;- 3 min timer for extra set time&lt;br /&gt;- continuous light time for flash setting&lt;br /&gt;- cord detaches for each boxing and cleanup&lt;br /&gt;- both hands easily fit&lt;br /&gt;(haven&#x27;t ever tried feet)&lt;br /&gt;VERY PLEASED!</li>
    <li> The light seemed pretty cheesey--very lightweight and unsubstantial.  All in all, I wasn&#x27;t too surprised when it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  Amazon was great about the return.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a UV lamp.  It&#x27;s got my nails gellin&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This UV Light Nail Dryer arrived quickly and does a great job for shellac nails.  I have used it about 6 times so far and I have absolutely no complaints.  I love the fact that it will accommodate two hands or two feet.  This really saves time.  The price was great, too.</li>
    <li> Twice a fast because I can fit both hands in at the same time.  I read reviews on quite a few of these and this one had high ratings.  Glad I went with this one.  I have used this a bunch and ( knock on wood ) it has worked beautifully!  I love everything about it and the price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> With the exception of figuring out how to get the nail color to cover to the tips, this light with the CND shellac worked perfectly with my first time using it.  I thought at first that the lights did not work but they had to be pushed in far enough and then all 3 lit up.  Definitely recommend; even if you only have your nails done 2 or 3 times a year, it will pay for itself.</li>
    <li> It cures the nail polish like it is supposed to.  It is rather large so you might want to go with a smaller one hand unit if you do not have a lot of storage space.  I have used the item twice and I have had fantastic results.</li>
    <li> If you do your own gel manicures at home this is a must own. I had this rinky dink 9w I bought from sallys which worked...but I could barely get my one hand in let alone both like this beauty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three settings, 2min-3min-continuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 bulbs included, all 18w&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I do my own manicures I don&#x27;t put both hands in, however it&#x27;s so nice and roomy I never fear accidentally bumping into the top or sides when inserting my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dries my gels superbly and securely. I have never once experienced lifting or any kind of machine malfunction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this, you WILL NOT regret it.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading reviews from others.  I&#x27;m licensed and wanted to have the needed items for Shellac nails.  This was half the price of the one sold by the makers of Shellac and it works perfectly. It&#x27;s also double the size, theirs isn&#x27;t, so you can do twice the work in the same amount of time.</li>
    <li> I just used this for my very first shellac manicure at home. It worked perfectly, came with everything that I needed, and dried the polish in the right amount of time. I&#x27;d buy this product again. Totally great for shellac polish!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It does exactly what it says. I can cure both hands at the same time. The Shellac polish really protects my nails and stays shiney until I remove it. It is so easy and quick ! My nails look great for about 2 weeks. I had someone ask me where I get my nails done- she was shocked I do them myself. It looks like I paid $40 to have them done. I use the base coat, white polish for the French tip, and top coat. Cure  it for a few minutes then wipe with pure acetone and cotton ball and you are done!I do wonder if I should wear tanning goggles when I do my nails though because the light is so bright!&lt;br /&gt;I would buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> want to purchase this item based on the reviews, but anyone know where to purchase replacement bulbs?  Are they a standard type bulb, easy to find?</li>
    <li> I ordered all my UV polishes and this lamp from Amazon. I can&#x27;t believe salons charge $30-$40 a pop for a gel manicure, that I can now do at home for free. Works great with the Shellac system so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Having now used my UV polishes and lamp numerous times, I have to say I love the gel polishes! It took me a few tries to get my manicure perfect, but I&#x27;m a pro now (I think). Some key points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The base coat/polish/top coat will not dry without the UV lamp. This is great, because if you screw up a nail you can just wipe it off and start over. Also, you can run the brush over the nail as many times as necessary to smooth the polish without worrying about it drying/clumping. Also, be sure to remove any excess polish you get on your skin before you cure with the lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The gel polishes are great for fixing a split/broken nail! Whereas before, if I split a nail, I had to cut it off, now I can mend the split with the gel polish. This stuff is strong and dries hard and essentially repairs the nail until the split grows out. HUGE plus for me as I am always breaking nails&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Sometimes I get bored with the shellac colors and want to use my OPI or China Glaze polishes, but still want the strength of the gel polish. I found I can use the UV base coat, cure for 30 sec., then put the UV top coat on over it (cure for 2 min). After it&#x27;s cured, I use rubbing alcohol to remove the sticky layer. I now have a strong, clear, gel base coat. I can now apply my other polish and then top off with my regular top cat. Fantastic! And it seems my regular polish lasts longer on my nails (maybe it sticks to the gel better?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, hope these tips help! If you are paying for gel polish at a salon, you really need to stop and buy this lamp/polishes!</li>
    <li> This light works great and cures the gel nicely.  I like the fact that you can place both hands in at the same time.</li>
    <li> I decided to do my gel nails at home. I&#x27;m very pleased with this UV/Gel light. It has 3 settings, 2 minute, 3 minute and continuous light. Works great. I&#x27;ve done several gel polishes at home with this light and it cures the polish very well. It&#x27;s great size too because both of your hands or feet can fit in it to cure at the same time. Comes with the light bulbs as well. Just be careful when you put them in, they are fragile. I&#x27;m very happy with this light and the price was very good!</li>
    <li> I got this with free Prime shipping, but it had one broken bulb. I got a replacement next day from Amazon. Great service.    This thing looks better in person than I expected. Seems well made. I use it to cure my OPI Axxium soak-off gel polish and it works great. It has plenty of room for both hands or both feet, but isn&#x27;t as bulky as I expected and very lightweight. Has a molded in handle on top too. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have bought both the one hand dryer and two hand dryer but surprisingly the one hand dryer works better. They were the same price and this one doesn&#x27;t work as well as the one I purchased before. They are the same brand so I don&#x27;t know why there is a difference because this one actually had a higher wattage.</li>
    <li> Works great, my wife got this for her birthday and has used it several times to do her own nails.</li>
    <li> We use this lamp with our CND Shellac we purchased.&lt;br /&gt;It works great and I LOVE that you can put both hands in at once!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t have asked for it to work better,&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;*Saerie</li>
    <li> I agree with the previous review.  No need to buy the expensive CND U/V Nail Dryer.  I am doing my own nails with Shellac products and use this unit.  It works great.  Save the money.  For complete directions on how to do your nails, go to the CND website and look up Shellac.  They give very complete, step-by-step, directions.</li>
    <li> This light did not work for me.  I am returning it. Late returning because I thought it was working for me.  Then I did Shellac on a client, when I went to wipe the nail on the final step.  The polish came off the thumbs.  Because it has no side lamps the thumbs did not cure.  You must be careful about this. I don&#x27;t want to take the risk again of having to redo a clint.  Time is money.</li>
    <li> I just received this product as a Christmas gift and I love it.  I really appreciated the review I read before leaving this one.  I don&#x27;t think I shook the base and top coat long enough.  I would also recommend using paper towel when using the alcohol to remove the tacky stuff after putting the top coat on.  It worked real well and did not leave anything on the nail like a cotton ball did.  I am excited to start experimenting with it.  I heard you can use the base and top coat of Shellac but use regular polish between.  I am interested to see if this works.  I would highly recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> I do my own shellac and get very creative with it, and it cures it just fine. I got one and had to return it and get another because the light would take like five minutes to turn on, but this new one works like a charm.</li>
    <li> The first time I did my nails with this, it worked beautifully with the gel polish.  I am very happy with the product and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Love that I can put both hands under the light at the same time.  No problems at all.</li>
    <li> In this case we paid a little bit more for this model based on the reviews on Amazon and we were glad we did. The construction and functionality of this unit is great!</li>
    <li> First thing&#x27;s first, one of the bulbs was defective so I called Thermal Spa and someone who spoke english answered and told me they&#x27;d ship me a new one. Pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product goes, it&#x27;s great. It dries the nails just as it said it would. Buy it now!</li>
    <li> It works but takes about 5 minutes per coat I think if you can get one with a small fan as well as the lights you would be happier. For the price I thought it would have been better.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a starter Gelish kit and a little UV light at Sally Beauty--the little light was only $15.00 and it was worked just fine--it uses batteries, but you can purchase a plug in separately, which I did not do. It&#x27;s really too small to put all 10 fingers in at once and is almost too thin of an opening to do toes, especially tough fit for the big toe without hitting the top bulbs.  I definitely want to get this one!  The Gelish is so much better for my mail health than the acrylics I had done at a salon for 3 years---Jeez, they were soooo expensive, and invariably the acrylic nail would come loose on most fingers within the first week.  With Gelish, I&#x27;m over 14 days--as the nail grew out- I used a fine grit nail file and polished the area at the cuticle til smooth, using a couple of different grits, both on the fine side, and cleansed w/ alcohol, then applied Ph Bond, then foundation coat, cured, color coat, cured and top coat and cured, then cleased to remove tackiness. This should extend the manicure at least another week.</li>
    <li> I use this UV light for the Shellac nail system and it works great! And the fact that I can dry both hands (or feet) at once is a bonus.  I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I had another lamp that I was trying to use for policrylic (sp) and shellac/Gelish. It was not working well and I was ready to give up. I just bought this baby yesterday and selected one day shipping. It arrived early in the AM and I tested on both Gelish and Shellac and it works AMAZING. My nails look fabulous and I am so excited that as a SAHM I can have gorgeous shiny nails without spending and arm and a leg.  So glad I didn&#x27;t buy the 150+ lights as this is PERFECT. It cured everything in two minutes. Thanks again Amazon for another great product!</li>
    <li> I just placed my order online, planning to use this dryer on traditional nail polish.  I&#x27;m going to stock some gel polish sooner or later.  But since I want to cure my polish in a quick manner, I am hoping this dryer would work just fine on regular nail polish.  Pretty ladies out there, please advise.  Is this an overkill if a U/V gel light nail dryer&#x27;s used for curing traditional nail polish?  Is it even safe?  Thanks for your help!</li>
    <li> I bought the Thermal Spa Pro UV Light hoping to save myself some money and enjoy my nails a bit more after having had shellac and Tammy Taylor&#x27;s Miracle Manicure applied in the salon a couple of times. I realized then that this was something I could so do myself.  I also purchased the Tammy Taylor Miracle Manicure Starter Kit (elsewhere) and followed the directions TO THE TEE not once, but THREE DIFFERENT TIMES.  Either the product failed or the lamp failed - not sure which.  My nails are in shreds and too painful to do anything further with at the moment.  When they grow out a bit and firm up, I am going to try Harmony Gellish products and see if the lamp is at fault or the Tammy Taylor products are - or simply the operator (me).  I suspect its the combination of the miracle manicure and my nails, but we will see.  My nails did not like the required filing off of the product for removal - and Tammy Taylor&#x27;s soak-off gels did not adhere to the miracle mani base, as promised, for even two days with extended curing times under the lamp (minimum of 4 minutes for each application).  The soak off of the gellish will be gentler and better for my purposes.  I am fairly certain the Thermal Spa lamp is fine and I will update my review after trying Harmony&#x27;s Gellish products.  The Thermal Spa arrived timely, was packed well, and has worked like a charm with each use.  It is a great size for fitting both hands (and maybe both feet) in at the same time, as per the advertisement.  The price was right and the size is great and I really like the built in handle, the variable timer, and the ability to remove the cord for storage.  In this regard, I have absolutely no complaints.  I only hope I can get Harmony&#x27;s products to work for me in order to save my sanity and my pocketbook!  Wish me success folks!</li>
    <li> The advertisement for this light is inaccurate. When it comes the box says one thing, and the UV lamp actually is a 2, 3 and 5 minute timer, not 1, 2, &amp; 5.</li>
    <li> Bulbs come loose very easily. Used it twice but got sick of the bulbs shifting loose in the middle of a manicure. The one time they stayed lit it did a good job but this is not a long lasting machine. Spend a bit more for the nicer models!</li>
    <li> I was worried about ordering this because I didn&#x27;t know if it would cure the CND shellac polish.  Works great and a great price!</li>
    <li> This pays for itself in a few uses.  It works well.  I&#x27;m not sure why some comments say that it doesn&#x27;t cure.  You have to use the alchohol wipes to get the sticky feel out of it.  I love the gel polish and the lamp, I have saved so much salon money by doing this myself.  I was a little messy at first but after some repeat attempts it works really well.  Nothing negative or bad to say about it.</li>
    <li> Described as \\&quot;comfortably accommodates two hands or feet\\&quot;...yes, if you&#x27;re a munchkin !&lt;br /&gt;I have average female hands and could not put both hands in for proper cure (exposure). As for feet ? I didn&#x27;t even go there...&lt;br /&gt;Amazon happily refunded my return, and I bought a different unit for 1 hand cure, for $15.00 less, the U-Spicy with timers and bulb guard, which I received yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love Amazon !</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading a ton of other shellac reviews. This thing is amazing. I just followed the other reviewers directions of 30 sec base coat, 2 min first coat, 2 min second coat, 2 min top coat. Then wipe with alcohol and bam. Beautiful shellac nails. My first time and worked like a charm. Buy this guys!! The bulbs don&#x27;t come with directions but they&#x27;re easy to snap into place.</li>
    <li> I love the convenience of being able to put both hands in at once. It makes the process a lot faster.  Also, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that big considering it&#x27;s a double wide. I just put it back in the box and put it in the closet when I&#x27;m not using it. The time on top is great too.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The dryer arrived on schedule with all parts (note bulbs are included in package below the unit)...seems to be working properly...I&#x27;ll find out for sure tonight!!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this dryer.  It is wide enough that I can put shellac polish on both hands and dry them at the same time.  I also like the feature of 2 minute and 3 minute timers.  I would recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> For being a &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; UV light, this takes forever to cure my gel nails.  It eventually gets the job done, but not before I start pondering the merits of the arguments I&#x27;ve heard for isolated hand/foot-skin cancer via UV light exposure.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with CND&#x27;S shellac. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. It comes with no instructions, however it is super easy to install and use. I cannot vouch for how it works with any products other than Shellac, but I give it 5 stars for a shellac manicure! There is truly no need to purchase the CND machine which is 100$ more expensive than this one. If you are looking for the perfect shellac manicure done from home with this machine, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, make sure your nails are properly cleaned. Then apply the CND base coat and bake for 1 minute. Follow by a colour coat, which I baked 3 minutes just to be on the safe side. Then another colour coat for 2 minutes, and a top coat for 2 minutes as well. Most important step: wipe your nails with 99% alcohol. NINETY-NINE, not 70. And VOILA perfect manicure done from home! 5 stars without a doubt.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The lamp works great! My favorite feature is the timer options. I get a set of nails at the salon, but then come home and paint them myself and this lamp sets the polish very quickly. I highly recommend this lamp.</li>
    <li> I bought my daughter this for Christmas and of course i was worried that it was a cheap version , or didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;She loved it and still does. She told me it&#x27;s just as good as the expensive ones out there. { she would know as she does her nails every day}</li>
    <li> Thus far I am very pleased with this purchase.  It was a good price, easy to put together, and worked like a charm. I only hope I can order bulbs as easily when these burn out.  Company shipped this in a timely manner and was packaged well.  I also like that you can put two hands (or feet) at a time.  If you want to do Shellac this is a GREAT choice! :)</li>
    <li> I use Gelish and creative and both do very well with this light. It&#x27;s big for two hands and has timers which are helpful.  I totally recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I was tired of getting my nails done every two weeks and spending so much money.  I wanted to do it myself and save the time and hassle every couple weeks.  I ordered this Thermal Spa to use with the Shellac Nail polishes and it works excellently.  I was so satisfied and my nails look beautiful.  I purchased two more of these along with the Shellac Nail polishes and gave them to my daughters for Christmas.  They love, love, love this.  It is EXCELLENT.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I wonder if anyone has tried the largest UV provider in the world, THE SUN.  Why wouldn&#x27;t it work for Shellac Nail Polish?</li>
    <li> I ordered it last Saturday April 22,2012 and I arrived to day. It was my first time painting my nails with the cnd shellac and this  uv lamp did the job perfectly! A+ do not hesitate no need to buy a $200 dryer.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Thermal Spa Gel Light Nail Dryer and love it. My husband is an electrician and determined I would like the total wattage of the lamps to be at least 42 watts not the lesser.&lt;br /&gt;It allows you to insert all your toes at one time or all fingers at one time in it. I paid $52.00 and that is about the price for one nail salon visit.</li>
    <li> Easy to assembly and great cure</li>
    <li> Item arrived beautifully packaged and nothing was out of place.  I have now used this three times and love the results.  I use CND polishes and my nails couldn&#x27;t look more professional and I am a true novice.  Love this machine and do recommend this to anyone wanting to do their own nails.</li>
    <li> It cures the nail polish as it is supposed to. I just figured for the price it would do it a liitle faster. I have to cure each coat for 6 mins, so it is hard and not sticky.</li>
    <li> I had first purchased from Bhavika A Vedawala/myotcshop Storefront and besides the fact that they took a long  time to deliver the produc came with a lamp that did not work. I returned it and  then bought if from Planet Stuff.  It was 5 dollars cheaper and Planet Stuff  delivered in only 2.5 days. Product came perfect. I just wish it had a 20 second setting and that the product was a little more \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;/sturdy... But I guess nowadays everything is very fragil. It&#x27;s a good product for a reasonable price. I use it with the Shellac nail polish.</li>
    <li> This is exactly the same LED lamp that my nail guy used to use when I visited his salon.  Though I wish it was a bit deeper, it works well, and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I purchased this nail dryer to do shellac nails at home.  It is easy to use and nice because I can do both hands at the same time.  Assembly required was inserting the bulbs into the unit (easy) and then plug it in.  It works as promised and I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Went from the mini light that took forever to dry both hands to this awesome beast! It&#x27;s really not that big to store and makes drying both hands at once SO much faster. I use a little sunblock on my hands as the light can be a bit warm at times. Great product for the price!!!</li>
    <li> i bought the nail light because it received so many good reviews, but i was a tad worried about a few bad reviews it had received.  the lights installed with no problem (and i don&#x27;t know how someone could not see them in the bottom of the box), the power cord was included, and it worked perfectly for me right away! i received the light yesterday and did my own manicure with the CND shellac system.  it worked perfectly!  love that my nails were dry right when i was done, and the light cured my nails just like it should.  i cured for a little bit longer (3 minutes instead of 2 for each coat)in case my coats weren&#x27;t as thin as they should be.  i&#x27;m happy with the purchase and can&#x27;t wait to see how the manicure lasts and then do my next one!</li>
    <li> I just received this product this past Saturday and right out the box worked great.  I was able to do my hands along with both my girls hands in less than 30 minutes tops.  Such an excellent buy, would recommend getting this light.  Plus its big enough for 2 hands was def. a big plus!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but I had to for this light because I think it&#x27;s such a great purchase. This light works SO well. I had only gone to the salon once to have the shellac done and immediately fell in love with it. My salon only charges $14 but I knew right away that I wanted to be able to do this myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish lasted for a week and would have lasted longer but my nails grow so fast that there was a lot of outgrowth after just a week. Plus I get tired of the same color quickly. I wanted to be able to change the color myself whenever I want to and I wanted to save money. I know that if I&#x27;ll be doing this weekly, this lamp will pay for itself in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lamp is huge. I can fit both hands and both feet in it. It&#x27;s so easy to use if you follow the instructions. I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it but if you can paint your nails with regular polish, you can do this. And it goes quicker than I thought. I bought three different CND polishes from Amazon as well. It dries very quickly and as soon as you&#x27;re done curing your last coat and wiping off the stickiness with alcohol, they&#x27;re solid and ready to go. It&#x27;s awesome! I can&#x27;t wait to order more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who say the bulbs aren&#x27;t included, you must have just missed them. Why would they sell a lamp with no bulbs? And if they did, they would tell you that in the description. This comes with everything you need but the polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT lamp at a great price. Definitely one of my most exciting and rewarding purchases in quite some time!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to cure my shellac nail system and it does a great job, and the price was really good too comapared to buying the creative uv lamp for 150.00. I would recommend this to anyone. I&#x27;ve had really good results.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and seemed to be packaged well.  Upon inspection, it looked used.  There were fingerprints and smudges on the inside surfaces.  The worst part, though, was that the bulbs did not plug in all the way.  I had to push them in tighter and hold them in place to actually get them to light up.  Very annoying.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> Works great for the opi gelcolor! I&#x27;m not a professional! I just use this for personal use.&lt;br /&gt;Base coat: 1 min&lt;br /&gt;Color coat: 2 min per coat&lt;br /&gt;Top coat : 4 min&lt;br /&gt;Then rub down with the alcohol soaked cotton</li>
    <li> I bought this item in July and it works nicely, drying nails quickly &amp; evenly.  I&#x27;m having a little problem finding replacement bulbs, tho.  Perhaps another owner could point me in the right direction?</li>
    <li> I previously owned a mini uv light for $20 and it took me an hour to do my nails.  I decided it was worth more money to get both hands done at the same time and am SO glad I purchased this.  The automatic timer was great, not having to watch a clock to be sure I used it long enough. I would DEFINITELY recommend this product if you want spa-like nails without the monthly cost.  It will pay for itself after doing your own nails a few times. If you&#x27;re on the fence which to buy...buy this one!</li>
    <li> I really like it. I can use for both hand (including thumbs). I was not sure what to buy, but so far I really like it. It would be nice if it had a 1 minute timer... but it is not a big deal. I use OPI Axxium soak-off and it works incredible. I think i would never go back to the traditional manicure... the investment was paid off in a little over a month... DIY</li>
    <li> I chose this item after reading the other reviews and it has been a great purchase. It is a bit large but not heavy and stores easily. It is big enough for both hands and was easy to use.    I use the Gelish polish and it works very well with that item. I plan to try the CND brand next.</li>
    <li> I have used the CND lamp for years and just bought this lamp. There is NO DIFFERENCE. If anything, this one is better because you can do both hands at once!! I PROMISE YOU! Buy this one - you&#x27;ll save $100!!</li>
    <li> Push in the bulbs forcefully,   yet gently, until you feel the click.   The bulbs are packed in the bottom of the  box. A++++++ product.</li>
    <li> I bought this Thermal Spa for my birthday last year(2011).(along with the Shellac top/bottom coats &amp; a few nail polish colors. All of that for right around $200!!)  I have loved it! It has more than paid for it&#x27;s self at $20-30 a pop for a salon manicure! I usually use this at least once a month and have had no problems so far. Don&#x27;t be afraid of this spa&#x27;s low price! Save your self the $$$ and get some new Shellac colors to go with it. :)</li>
    <li> I agonized over whether to purchasea a U/V nail dryer or not.  After reading many, many reviews, I narrowed down my choices to this dryer, the price had much to do with my decision.  Yet, I ordered it with some doubts that it would work for my needs as I mainly wanted to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; regular nail polish rather than gel.  I have many bottles of regular nail polish to use before making the big switch to Shellac, which I consider a little costly for me at the present time.  Some of the reviews for this dryer stated that the dryer came without bulbs.  I&#x27;m wondering if the people writing these reviews actually checked the box thoroughly, as the bulbs come separately bubble-wrapped and boxed under a layer of cardboard in the box with the dryer.  I received three 18-watt bulbs, so this is a 54-watt dryer, a bit more powerful than what the product is described as.  One review stated that the dryer is \\&quot;flimsy\\&quot; and cheaply made and that the bulbs keep falling out.  The 3-prong bulbs must be fully inserted into their holders, there is no way they can fall out if properly installed.  The dryer is very well made and I am expecting years of use.  My regular nail polish dries perfectly.  I start with 2 minutes each for the base coat and first coat, then increase the time to 3 minutes each for the second coat of color and the top coat.  If a coat should go on a little thick, I dry it a second time just to make sure it&#x27;s cured through.  I get a couple of extra days out of my polish now, but I mainly wanted to speed up the drying process of regular nail polish, which this dryer does to my satisfaction.  I would recommended this dryer.</li>
    <li> Bought this 4 my daughter she loves it! It even works for gel polish! Really speeds up the nail drying time &amp; big enough for both hands!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a good product because of who make it but my sally hanson cheap- one works so much better</li>
    <li> Unfortunately on first time of using it blew up within 10 seconds of turning it on made a Big Bang and smoke went everywhere.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend this light at all.  The time indicated for drying was not ample time, nails were still wet, not just tacky.  Had to leave hands in for 3x the amount of time after each application and my hands felt like they were getting a tan not drying nails.  Very dissatisfied!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for gel polishes. I chose to go with UV because it&#x27;s cheaper and there are still some gel systems that do not cure with LED. Anyway, this easily fits one hand (perhaps can fit two but I paint one hand at a time) and doesn&#x27;t get hot. Exactly what I needed at a wonderful price.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to acctually use this item yet, but I do know that if it holds up it was a fantastic price! It came quickly and was packaged well. I&#x27;m excited to try it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to  do the Shellac at home after a Shellac Mani/Pedi cost me $125 with tip.  Ummmm hello!?  I bought this Light, Base Coat, Top Coat and a Polish for slightly more.  I&#x27;ve already got my money back.  Works perfect with the Shellac.  30 seconds on the base, 2 minutes on each polish coat and then I do 5 minutes on the top coat just to be sure.  They come out perfect, just like at the salon.  Just make sure to push your cuticles back,  The Shellac is so awesome, such an amazing breakthrough in Nails and with this puppy you can get the magic at home for a fraction of the cost!   Winning!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received this UV light, but when I pulled it out of the box it had a crack on the top front right side.  I was so disappointed, although it still worked great when I used it for the first time, and I loved the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I looked into exchanging it, I actually had to return it and order a new one (instead of simply exchanging) because I had originally ordered it from a third party seller.  So, when I went order it again I discovered the price had gone up.  I should be able to receive a replacement at the same price I ordered the first one.  When I contacted Amazon they helped me get the new UV Lamp at the original price. Lesson learned - it&#x27;s easier to return items that are ordered from Amazon sponsored items.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  I do my own nails and it saves me tons of money!  Have had it for several months and not had any problems with it working properly.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once so far, but I love it.  It worked very well to dry my Gelish manicure.</li>
    <li> The lamp was larger than I thought, which is a good thing! I love it and it works great, would recomend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> After much research I was almost afraid to purchase any of the UV lights on the market, but I decided to try the Thermal Spa. A UV light is a vital part of the new gel and shellac nail polishes.  After spending 3x the normal manicure rate at the salon to get my nails done, I decided to try doing my own.  While the polish itself it more expensive than regular nail polish, the light to cure the gel was the most expensive part.  Many were available in the lower price ranges, but most reviews showed them to be inferior with many problems.  I chose this nail dryer because of its size and mostly good reviews.  It is everything the manufacturer says it is.  Large enough for 2 hands, built in timer, and easy to use.  It was shipped in a timely manner and works great.  My only complaint would be that there was not much instructional information with the unit.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed by this UV light. Salon / spa quality or better. The first one I purchased had a connection problem with one of the bulbs but Amazon made it so easy to return so I could purchase another. Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> This light was a little difficult to insert the light tubes, but once this is done, the light is easy to use and stores back in the box.   YOu only need it every couple of weeks.   Be sure and put in the back light before putting the the top lights.</li>
    <li> This UV light is the same light my manicurist uses. I Googled it when I got home and found it here on Amazon for a great price. I&#x27;ve been using it at home with the Harmony Gelish UV polish with great results. Large UV light allows for two hands, or both feet. The dry times are great and I love that the cord in the back unhooks completely for easy storage.     Just one thing to remember-- there&#x27;s a small bar at the back, and you need to STOP when you feel it with your fingertips. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll bump the bottom light with your nails and ruin your polish!    This is a great light-- well worth the investment!</li>
    <li> This is the best buy ever!  You can do your own Shellac nails - don&#x27;t let the salons tell you differently.  I was very worried that I would not be able to, but with this lamp and the Shellac products, it&#x27;s easier than I ever thought.  I followed the directions perfectly and my nails look perfect.  The directions on the CND web site will give you all you need, but you don&#x27;t need to buy their expensive lamp.  My nails cured just fine with this affordable lamp and with the double size, my nails were done in less than an hour (and that includes taking off the Shellac from salon).  BTW - the salon I went to did an awful job - too thick and peeled in a week.  However, I do suggest you go once or twice to an experienced nail tech to watch how it&#x27;s done.  After that, even I could do it and I am not that good at painting my nails.  My Shellac lasts about 12 - 14 days.  Save yourself at least $500 a year and do it yourself!  Important note - Amazon featured this for $70 when I bought it - it looks like it&#x27;s much more expensive now??? I am not sure I&#x27;d pay $145 - I would be temped to buy used off eBay or look elsewhere for a better deal.  It works great, but $70 would be my price range for a UV lamp.</li>
    <li> Received this product promptly. I works wonderfully. Would recommend to everybody. Have used several times, makes nails look professionally done, but are done at home.</li>
    <li> I think this works well. It cures my shellac well and it does the job it is intended for.  And right now, I see the price is far lower than it was when I bought this.     But it has a huge footprint which makes storage annoying and takes up too much room on the table.    I could fit four of my feet in there.  My cats were fascinated and could get their little heads in there (good thing we have no kittens). It is more than you could possibly need.    I&#x27;d buy from the same manufacturer, but opt for the regular unit!    Do not buy from Venet, a vendor who never bothered to send.</li>
    <li> i love it it works grate.. iv owned it for 4 mos now and use it at lest 4 times a week.. :)</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great with shellac! Will def recommend to friends. Reasonably priced also. I would def buy another one in the future</li>
    <li> Based on reviews I was sure this item was perfect......until it arrived without it&#x27;s cord.  After contacting Amazon, I had to return it because the 3rd party vendor USA Vitamins doesn&#x27;t send missing parts. Lovely, not! Amazon was great to refund, but wouldn&#x27;t it have been a whole lot easier if someone could have just sent the missing part (cord)?   I&#x27;m almost tempted to just go buy a cord, but on principle I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done! I got it for my Opi Axxium gel nails and it works fine with them. I feel like it takes me more time to cure the gel now than it did in the beginning but it has been a year so that is expected.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews I decide on this one.  Works great easy to install bulbs, have used it 4 times now. Its a two hander so lots of room to move around. Glad I bought this one</li>
    <li> I recieved my light, but the bulbs all say 18 watts. Is this normal? It works, but I am leaving my nails under extra just to be sure.</li>
    <li> Love this lamp!!!!!  FINALLY!  After 5 purchases and 3 returns, I&#x27;ve finally got what I need!  There would have been a 4th return had I not waited too late...I was trying to save $$$ and give it a fair shot...but it works with regular polish and was only $11...so I&#x27;m not too mad at that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t come with very good instructions, so I had to figure out how to get the lights in...and I wondered if I needed to touch the actual bulb...I work in TV and if you touch some bulbs...the oil from your hands will cause them to blow and not work...just being cautious.  It uses 2 bulbs though and came with 3.  Hoping they last long and are not expensive to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that....This is the bomb!  I can fit both hands, haven&#x27;t tried toes yet, but will do one at a time just to be safe.  I can spread my fingers out so they don&#x27;t touch.  Doesn&#x27;t get hot...I did the 3 minute cure then the 2, just to be safe.  I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but I am in love.  I&#x27;ll update review if anything happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Harmony Gelish polish...the whole kit...$25 to $35 here but $45 at Sallys....&lt;br /&gt;I buy my polish on here too, because for $12.95 you get a mini bottle at Sallys, and here you get a full sized!</li>
    <li> I love this light!  I have NO problems with the lights falling out like other people said, if you push them in until they click they are fine! Large enough to fit both hands or both feet.  I use mine alot since I have a big family and everyone wants their nails done and it works perfect!  I use the gelish nail polish.  Other people complained about the 2 min setting and it not having a 1 min setting, WHO CARES!  I leave my nails in a little longer ayway to make sure they are fully cured! DON&#x27;T BE AFRAID TO PURCHASE THIS UV LIGHT!  In my opinion it&#x27;s PEWRFECT FOR GEL NAIL POLISH!!!</li>
    <li> the lights DO NOT dry the polish recommended to go with this machine. I feel ripped off and could have donated the money somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to start using this! I pay way too much money at a nail salon for me not to start doing them myself. But, the only downfall.. no bulbs came with the dryer! Does anyone know where to purchase them?</li>
    <li> Did not like this product, it went on and off the first time I used it.  It would not stay on.</li>
    <li> This dryer should be advertised for toes/pedicures only. The dryer isn&#x27;t deep enough the lights are low to the base.  My nails kept hitting the bulbs. I don&#x27;t think I have longer than normal fingers.</li>
    <li> I just used this lamp for the first time and it did everything it was suspose to do!  I am a complete novice with nails, but I purchased some shellac nail polish and the lamp in order to avoid trips to the salon.  It worked beautifully!  Best thing to remember is that the polish should be used as if it is typical polish. The coats should be thin; just remember to cover the edge of the nail, especially with the top coat.   The drying time was only about 2 min per coat, except that I dried the top coat about 5 min, \\&quot;just in case\\&quot;.  I wiped off the nails with alcohol and I feel like I have just come home from the salon.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This light is perfect. I can fit both my hands in it and works well on toenails, also. I do 2 minutes between coats and it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> When I first got the lamp, it worked perfectly and I was thrilled.  However, after I used it 4 times the lights began to flicker every time I turned it on and eventually stopped working entirely.  I tried turning it off and on, changing the light bulbs etc. to no avail.  It was a good product while it worked but the short time it worked made it useless to me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if anybody else has discovered this, but I find that the UV light helps \\&quot;cure\\&quot; regular nail polish into a much stronger, more durable prodouct.  I was getting gels at the salon but, after repeated applications and removal, my nails were getting destroyed. I decided to take a break from the gels and noticed that my regular salon manicures were lasting way longer than my home manicures, even though I was using all the same products.  The only difference:  I dried my nails under a UV light with a fan at the salon.  So, I bought this light for home use and -- Ureka -- my polished nails are lasting days longer, even when doing laundry and housework.  I&#x27;m using the light (along with a small fan) to cure each step of the application:  I put on two coats of base coat (OPI Nail Envy)and use the light/fan combo for a couple minutes, two coats of color (OPI)and use the light/fan for a couple minutes, finish with top coat(Seche)and use the light/fan again. The polish was totally dry and I immediately used my hands without fear of messing up the polish.  The manicure is lasting a whole lot longer than it used to.  I&#x27;m on day #5 without a chip, having done 8 loads of laundry and ironing.  And believe me, my natural nails are tissue paper-thin.    I gave 4 out of 5 stars only because the bulb connections are pretty flimsy.  I hope the light lasts.  It&#x27;s the same unit they use in the salon I go to, so I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic.</li>
    <li> This lamp is very good. I also have the 36 watt cheaper lamp as well and I prefer this one.  Definitely worth the difference in price. This lamp  large enough to fit both hands in at once or both feet in at once. I have personally used with the IBD Builder Gels, Gelish and Shellac and the all cure great. For those having issues in curing make sure that you are wiping the final layer off with alcohol. Gel polish is not like regular polish the polish remains tacky as you dry each layer. Once you dry the final top coat the tacky finish needs to be removed with alcohol. Another reviewer mentioned that this lamp works great with the OPI Gelcolor as well.  I can&#x27;t wait to try this lamp next with OPI Gelcolor hopefully the polish will show up in the mail soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have an initial issue in getting the lamp to start but that had to do with my incorrectly installing the bulbs I did no push them in far enough once that was corrected the lamp has worked great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to have to return this dryer for much more expensive OPI LED dryer because the Thermal Spa just will not cure the OPI gel polish.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was cheaper than the ones I found in Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply store (~100$). It comes with the bulbs, which is nice, and it has 3 settings for the timer. It works perfectly with my gelish nail polishes. Since gelish calls for 2 min under the lamp between each coat, the 2 min timer on this lamp really minimize the hassle of me trying to set my iphone timer while trying not to ruin my nails. I have not tried it with other types/brands of gel polish.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic for anyone who loves to do nails.  The longer it takes nails to dry the more likely you are to smudge or otherwise mess up the polish.  This light nail dryer works fantastically!</li>
    <li> Original review:  I read a lot of reviews prior to ordering all the products to do the CND Shellac nails at home.  This particular gel light dryer was the one most recommended.  Since I was unsure if I was going to be able to do the Shellac process myself, I didn&#x27;t want to spend an huge amount of money but did want a light that was appropriate.  This light arrived quickly and packaged well and I easily had it up and running.  Note that it is a 45 watt light which is much better than some of less expensive models.  I have had it for 4 months and have used it both for manicures and pedicures every two weeks. I have found it to work flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a few complaints but they would not prevent me from recommending the light nor would they  prevent me from repurchasing. 1. It comes with limited instructions and gives only generic parameters for drying.  I followed the recommendations on the CND Website.  2. It has a one year warranty but there is a $14 fee required if you send it in to be repaired. 3.  There is no information anywhere (not even the Thermal Spa website) that gives any indication of how long the bulbs will last or if they need to be replaced because they become weak.  4.  I decided to order extra bulbs just to have on hand and found they are $11.99 each at the cheapest vendor on Amazon.com.  To replace all three bulbs would be $35.97 and a totally new light unit is only $54.18 as of this writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After using the Thermal Spa for a year and deciding that the CND Shellac process was something I wanted to continue doing at home, I decided to purchase the CND u/v dryer.  I had found out some interesting facts about using this for the shellac process and decided I wanted to purchase.  One large difference is the fact that the CND dryer has a fan inside.  The Thermal Spa does not.  Also, it has been developed exclusively for use with the CND Shellac polishes.  Another factor was that other reviewers said they felt it did a better job than the other models.  Another factor was it has buttons for each specific drying time required for the process (10 seconds, 120 seconds, etc.) that the Thermal Spa did not have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been pleased with the Thermal Spa light but after using the CND Lamp just one time I can see a tremendous difference in the quality of my manicure. It is much more professional looking and is lasting much longer. I really wish I had purchased the CND Lamp to begin with.  It really is worth the difference in price.</li>
    <li> If you do your nails at home and like the gel polish, this UV light nail dryer is a must have.</li>
    <li> Just got this UV gel light nail dryer is awesome everything was in side the box and the three light bulbs there was no problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;am a nail tech. this machine can use any gel nail polish. you can put both hands and side the uv light. the price is just right so happy i went this Light.</li>
    <li> This is a good lamp, lots of power and exactly as described! My nail polish stays perfect for weeks. This is much more powerful than any of the lamps at Ulta or Sally and there is plenty of room for 2 hands or feet.</li>
    <li> this is a great buy for the money and i save not having to go to the salon and get a manicure on their time and paying for the whole thing i can just do it this way and get my nails to dry so much faster</li>
    <li> Died as soon as I plugged it in</li>
    <li> I love shellac but hated paying $40 every two weeks so I decided to try the do it yourself method!  After researching UV dryers I settled on this Thermal Spa one due to the price and overall good reviews.  Totally satisfied!  This works great since you can paint both hands and dry them at once.  Definitely follow the CND times for drying your nails and the tips on the process (i.e. paint a thin coat each time, seal the ends of your nails and the cuticles) and you will have a salon worthy manicure!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this to use with the new Shellac system.  Works great!  Nice and roomy so you can use for a pedi too.  Previously bought another lamp and it didn&#x27;t work with the Shellac system at all.  Love this!</li>
    <li> works great. you can fit both hands &amp; both feet in.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and worked like a charm!  No more going to the salon for a gel manicure.  I now have all the tools to do it myself when I want and how I want!  The light is large and cuts the curing time because you can do both hands at the same time!  Good price!  Go for it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave Amazon reviews, but I relied heavily on the reviews of this product to make my purchase, so I thought I would write one myself. I purchased the light in order to give myself Shellac manicures at home. It arrived very quickly. The lights were packaged in the bottom of the box and the power cord was in the top. I clicked the lights into place in seconds, plugged it in, and was ready to go! It worked perfectly for applying Shellac. I love that it&#x27;s wide enough for both hands. I paint both hands with whatever coat I am on, and then cure them together, which saves so much time and also uses the bulbs less so I won&#x27;t have to replace them as often. Since I&#x27;ve only used this once, I can&#x27;t attest to how long it will last. That being said, it is even nicer looking than the one my nail tech uses in her salon, plus it will pay for itself in no time with the money I am saving. It&#x27;s a great little machine!</li>
    <li> This is a great poroduct. Get at home for a lot less what you would pay at a nail business. Wonderful product - works great and gives you great nails.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for coupling with purchase of OPI gel starter kit.  Fast delivery. Easy to use. Ample space for drying one hand with fingers completely separated and extended.</li>
    <li> Bought light to use with gelish nail product.  Light worked great!  My nails are very short and crack and peel even at a very short length.  I am trying the gel nail route to see if I can strengthen my nails and let them grow out a bit.  First application a great success.  Cleaned/buffed up nail bed very well and had a good clean base for applying product.  Application easy using one thin coat each of base, color (simply sheer) and top coat.  Outcome is excellent- smooth, clean, natural looking nails that are very, very shiny.  I am happy with the gelish product also - comes in nail polish style bottle and very easy to apply thinly.  I&#x27;ll post how the nails wear and how removal is in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Lovin&#x27; this light! I&#x27;m using it with gelish polish and it works great! The only issue is the design of one of the bulb clips in the back...it sticks out right where your nails go...so be careful not to smudge your polish!</li>
    <li> This UV lamp is wonderful. I can&#x27;t specify as to it&#x27;s long term reliability, as I&#x27;ve only had it for less than a week, but it cuts the time it takes me to do my nails with Shellac in half.Because I do both hands (or feet) at once, instead of having to do them separately. It arrived so quickly, I was shocked and very, very pleased.</li>
    <li> AWESOME MACHINE! Works great! Price is perfect! Lightbulbs last a long time… over a year and still going...</li>
    <li> I applied one undercoat and one top coat of shellac.  Used UV light for 6 minutes.  Shellac very tacky afterwards.  After waiting 45 minutes (not using light), still tacky.  Then I saw the alcohol trick and that made all the difference.  I wiped off each nail with rubbing alcohol and they look very shining and instantly lost the tackiness.  I will update this review once I see how long the polish last.  But pleased with machine so far.  Knocked off one star since package seemed used...retaped.  And machine had a few water spots inside.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product from amazon to use with Nail harmony gelish. This product is fantastic. It is definitely big enough for both hands and both feet, which is a great time saver. It also comes with 3  18 watt lamps. Only 2 are necessary to give 36 watts to cure nails. Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp in order to cure my CND Shellac UV Gel colors. The lamp got to me in no time, well packed and damage free. Super easy to put together (place 3 light bulbs in their place and plug in). The lamp works flawlessly and even my very first CND Shellac application turned out perfectly. Could not have asked for a better product!!!</li>
    <li> I like this.  Had it for over a year.  I use it to set regular nail polish.  It works very well.  My regular polish lasts a good two weeks when I use the UV light.  The bulbs were a little hard to snap into place.  You MUST push hard and you&#x27;ll hear them click.  Once I got them in, they were set.  There is a timer for a 2 and 3 minute setting that automatically turns off the lamps when done. It&#x27;s nice and light to move around and there is a little handle built into the top to make it easy to grap.  It really is large enough for me to get both of my size 11 wide feet into,  and you can do two hands at once.</li>
    <li> This nail dryer is super amazing for all UV nail polishes (including Shellac and OPI axxium). It came with 3 bulbs, 18 V each. You only need 2 of them (a total of 36 V) in order to fully dry your polish. You can keep the third one for a later replacement. I highly recommend this item for those who are getting into the new UV nail polish system.</li>
    <li> I purchased a very small UV lamp through Sally&#x27;s for $60.00. When I saw this one on Amazon I immediately purchased it because the price was great and the lamp is wide enough to fit two hands. It also has two, three, and constant timers. I wish it also had a thirty second and one minute timers but it&#x27;s no biggie considdering the price. When I openend the box I could tell this was a profesional product right away.</li>
    <li> Works great with Shellac.....only draw back is that I wish it had a fan</li>
    <li> I enjoy the gel nails with this UV light!  This is useful, U can put  two hands or two foot into the light!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product once and was extremely pleased with it.  It&#x27;s big so you can put both hands or both feet into it.  Since I&#x27;m new at using Shellac gel polish, I think it&#x27;s best for now to do one hand at a time.  I would recommend this product. It works well and is a good price.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this dryer.  I got this dryer and the CND shellac base coat, color and top coat.  I am so happy I discovered the Shellac products and have been able to get the same salon results at home.  I am a working mom with 2 small children so my nails are tested to the max.  I had given up on painting my nails because they are chipped and wrecked within 24 hours.  The Shellac line really does what they claim - it looks amazing 14 days later.  If you love having your natural nails look amazing without going fake, this shellac line is for you!!!</li>
    <li> Blue light never came on... returned!</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous about buying this light because I&#x27;d heard of lights that were marketed as similar to those in salons, but took twice as long to cure.  This one is PERFECT!  It&#x27;s the perfect size for both hands and cures perfectly.  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Super ! I use it with CND products, it&#x27;s much cheaper then CND lamp, but it&#x27;s perfect, it cures just like the CND lamp !</li>
    <li> I was hoping to give this dryer a high rating but the cord did not come with the item and I emailed the company a week ago with no response.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! Works great and you do not need to spend 150.00 on the shellac uv light! Does both hands at the same time! Very impressed with this product!</li>
    <li> If you are contemplating this product, STOP!  I have been paying $25-$45 every two weeks for shellac at the salon.  I have used the lamp twice now and my nails look as nice as the salon. The CND shellac is the only product I use and it stays on as long as as the salon as well.  No instructions were included with the lamp, but all I did was google them and found them right away.  I LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> ordered as a gift for my girlfriend since 8.October.2011 and not received till 28.March.2012. Don&#x27;t buy from these thieves. big time scam really a waste of money</li>
    <li> I studied many reviews before purchasing this dryer.  It is great and my Shellac nails look very pretty.  I am very happy. Would recommend this dryer. Important to follow directions for preparing nails and applying Shellac</li>
    <li> Received my Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V gel Light Nail Dryer in less time than expected. It was packaged well and was new and unopened.  I assembled it easily and after reading the directions, was ready to go in just a few minutes.  I am new to the CND Shellac line, but I bought this light to cure this product line, which I also just ordered and received.  It worked perfectly with this product. I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution - For those who no longer sun bathe or go out in the sun without sunscreen, I recommend covering arms and other body parts when using any UV light as the reflected rays can add up in time.  When doing a manicure that requires repeated exposures under the light, I use gloves with the fingertips cut out to keep my hands protected and a long-sleeved shirt to cover my arms &amp; chest so that I keep my exposure to a minimum. I also angle the light away from my face and avert my eyes when curing my polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had a few weeks, but so far, I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to use on CND&#x27;s Shellac and it works great. Dries the nails perfert and such a better price than CND&#x27;s light.</li>
    <li> I received this item, inserted UV lights, plugged in unit and Turned unit switch on... NOTHING.... DID NOT WORK...  Won&#x27;t buy from this seller again...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. She said this was best gift ever. Must buy</li>
    <li> I received the item on time. I put the bulbs in and plugged it into the outlet, and nothing! I was very disappointed to find out that I would have to send the item back. Unbelievable!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before buying this uv lamp and I was impressed. I also want my cnd shellac polishes to be done fast, no time for one hand at a time curing. Using this lamp also reduces the bulb usage, because you cure both hands or both feet at the same time. It saves time and money, period. My shellac nails look beautiful and have lasted very long. The cost is also economical. I am very pleased with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you keep it on, the thing shorts out, someone else has one of the same kind, and it doesn&#x27;t do that. I think we got sold a lemon.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer so that I could use gelish nail polish. I got the bulbs in and turned the unit on and the power lights flashed, but no bulbs came on. I took them out and replace them again, turned the unit on and off, and I can&#x27;t even get them to come on. Really disappointed with this unit and will be returning it to Amazon. I&#x27;m surprised this unit has mostly good reviews....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE - 07/2014&lt;br /&gt;After becoming very frustrated with this unit I discovered that you have to push the bulbs in pretty forcefully ( until they click into the unit!) I&#x27;ve had this dryer for 2 years now and it works great. I saved the box it came in and it stores more easily in the bathroom cabinet. Dries gel nail polish really quickly and it has saved me a ton of money over the years now that I can do my own gel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product quite a few times and it&#x27;s holding up quite well. Dries CND and Gelish polishes (the only ones I&#x27;ve tried). Big enough to fit both hands or feet. At the end, dry the top coat an extra two times or so to make sure the polish is dry....one final dry didn&#x27;t quite do it for me.</li>
    <li> The big problem with this unit is that it does NOT come with bulbs.  This means you cannot use it when it arrives.  In addition, it is almost impossible to find replacement bulbs especially if you are not a registered nail technician and it takes three bulbs at $10 a piece plus shipping so make sure you factor this into the unit cost.</li>
    <li> After much research, I decided to buy this UV lamp system.  I did not want a lamp shipped from Hong Kong.  and I wanted a brand name.  I saw this lamp sold on some nail websites for much more than the $60 some odd dollars it was here.    Some tips for using this with Gel Nails.  1.  Always mix the bottles, I have had the nails flake off after about a week because the polish was not well mixed.    2.  I use the Harmony / Gelish pH balance before I put the base coat on.  This basically takes any moisture or oils out of your nail and makes them an acidic pH.   Its cheap too    3.  Gelish Basecoat , a  very thin layer and dry for 1 to 2 min.  This lamp does not have a one minute timer .... I wish it did    4.  Polish Coat.... again a very thin layer and BE SURE to try and wrap the polish around to the top edge of your nail.  This creates a seal and will cause less chipping.  Be sure to dry for the full two mintues for each coat.  Do a three minute dry if you are using a dark polish    5.  Gelish Top Coat.... this bring you the shine you want.  Super thin layers are key and wrap that top coat over the edge/ tip of your nail.    Hope this helps</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this one time so far, but I&#x27;d say it worked pretty well!  I bought this dryer thinking it was 45 watts, but it arrived with 3 18watt bulbs, so it&#x27;s really 54 watts, but I suppose that&#x27;s not a bad thing!  The bulbs are a little awkward to put in, and you&#x27;ve got to push the bulbs into place until you hear a snap, otherwise they won&#x27;t turn on.  overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with shellac nail polish and I am very happy with the results. I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work but it did. I guess the only advise I would give is make sure you wipe the nails with  99percent alchol when finished or you might think it didn&#x27;t work. That has more to do with bad directions I found on the internet than this product but it might make you think the lights don&#x27;t work with shellac. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the cnd lights at twice the price!</li>
    <li> Best UV light I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> This product is great! I use it with the CND Nails. The CND system is the best, and will only be improved in the years to come.    This large UV lamp works great for CND Shellac nails- no need to buy $200 plus one that CND recommends!!! It works perfectly for this UV polish system and set my color just fine with no need for a repeat cure. Your nails will feel tacky at the end of the process, but simply follow directions. The last step is to wipe your nails with 100% alcohol, this takes off the sticky coating. The lamp does the trick perfectly. My nails lasted 14 days. I even did a french manicure that came out fantastic! Make sure you put thin coats on. The thinner the coat, the better the cure! Make sure you use cotton pads, not cotton balls. Cotton balls leave too much fuzz, and sticks to the tackiness of the polish system.    TIP: I spoke to my manicurist who verified that you don&#x27;t have to use CND color polish, only the Top and base coats!    I will never go back to acrylic just to keep the polish on!</li>
    <li> I am not going to rate this product yet until I have actually used it. However, I will say this....I was to get it on the 28th ( It came today a day earlier! YAY!!) And it was properly packaged and Product box &amp; everything inside is mint. Put my product together and plugged it in . Beautiful! I already bought the starter kit from Sally&#x27;s ( Sorry! It was cheaper and no shipping and handling fee ) Just have to go pick up my color today &amp; I will let ya all know how it goes :-) EXCITED ! lol</li>
    <li> Does a decent job!  Sometimes it flickers but that can be changed by just turning it off and then back on.</li>
    <li> This product does work.  There are really no instructions with it regarding where to find bulbs and cord (hiding in card board-must disassemble entire box to find parts), or how to install bulbs and use.  First time I flipped the switch in the back on I thought the bulbs would light. They don&#x27;t light until you push the \\&quot;UV lamp\\&quot; black dot on top of the unit.  I used the two minute timer for my base coat and the 3 minute timer for my top coat- only clear for me.  Wiped the sticky layer off with nail polish remover and they were good to go!</li>
    <li> I want to buy this as a gift but I really am not sure if it works for regular, storebought nail polish (like Revlon or Sally Hansen). Can anyone who has experience with this nail dryer or nail dryers in general tell me for sure? I see many references to gel and shellac polish, which I am not familiar with so I want to be sure. The person it&#x27;s for uses regular polish. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Bought this light to use with the CND shellac system and it works great! When I first received it one of the bulbs was busted but upon contacting the seller they told me they couldn&#x27;t just send me a new light but could offer some of my money back and it was enough to buy a bulb through another seller. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Ok, when I ordered this, I did not expect it to be salon quality! It was so much cheaper than the others available, I didn&#x27;t expect much for an at-home nail dryer. However, it came in the mail today and I just had to try it out! WOW. It is huge!!! I can not only place my entire hand in it, but probably both if I wanted to! Wonderful value for the money!!!!Works great!!</li>
    <li> I had purchased a less expensive light prior to buying this one. This one is SO MUCH better -- works beautifully for Gelish products. It&#x27;s well worth the money. My only complaint is that the bulbs don&#x27;t stay in very well. I have to push them in and check often to see that they are still fully plugged in and &#x27;on&#x27;. Other than that it&#x27;s great! The Gelish light that they recommend (it&#x27;s like $15 or so) is TERRIBLE -- wouldn&#x27;t waste the money or effort on that one.</li>
    <li> Some assembly required.  I was worried about having to put the bulbs in because I was afraid to brake them, but they went right into the sockets with no problems.  Plugged it in and turned the switch and it powered right up.  No problems yet!</li>
    <li> Excellent service.  Last minute purchase before Christmas.  The box was slightly dinged, but the product was perfect!  The light is easy to use.  I&#x27;ve loved this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this light.  I do my nails every couple weeks or so and they look as good as if I had paid big bucks to get them done.  For the price, it has more than paid for itself with the money I have saved doing my nails myself</li>
    <li> I ordered this over a year ago and I use it all the time. It has saved me so much money (versus going to the salon) and with a little one at home (making it hard to get away for nail appointments) I can do my nails myself durning nap time or in the evenings. My nails turn out just as good as if I had them done professionally. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I bought a cheaper 35 watt one hand lamp first, didn&#x27;t work that well, so I bought this one. At first I thought this light did not work because my nails were so tacky after drying..I wiped nails with scott towel soaked with 99.9% alcohol and amazing from tacky mess to shiny smooth finish....On 2nd manicure with this light, both have been easy to do and lasted for over 2wks...LOVE THIS LIGHT!! It has already paid for itself..</li>
    <li> I started doing my nails and I have had this lamp for the past year. This lamp has not failed I have used it countless times.</li>
    <li> I love this nail dryer! You can use it for any type nails and apply a gel top coat to preserve your mani or pedi for over 2 weeks. I live in Florida and have to apply sunblock year round for myself and kids. It would always ruin my top coat not anymore :) this uv light lets me put on a durable top coat so so happy. Got it in two days with prime membership live amazon!!!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome UV light!  I purchased it to cure my UV gel nail polish and it works great.  The unit is much larger than I thought it would be, you can use it for your hands and feet.  You can put both hands or feet inside at once if you need to.  The unit came well packaged with the light bulbs.  Easy to use and I have absolutely no complaints.  Buy this if you need a UV light and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I bought this light to use with CND Shellac products about 6 months ago and it has worked perfectly.  As long as you follow the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions for Shellac polish verbatim, the lights cures the gel effectively within minutes and the manicure lasts for at least 10 days before beginning to show signs of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When OPI first released their new gelcolor product, I decided to test it with this light.  It will cure, but with very unpredictable results.  From what I&#x27;ve read on the OPI professionals website, the gelpolish is meant to be used with OPI&#x27;s LED light.  I cannot speak to the quality of gelpolish when used with the LED lamp, but I do not suggest using it with this lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, if you use Shellac, this light is more than capable of curing the polish effectively at a fraction of the price of CND&#x27;s lamp.</li>
    <li> WOW it&#x27;s big.  The two hander was the same price at the one hander so I got the two hander.  It&#x27;s pretty honkin.  My main complaint it that it only has 2 and 3 minute auto timer and I would really like a 1 minute which I think it claims to have) for doing the OPI Axxium.  Works very well.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE! 7 months later.&lt;br /&gt;Axxium is too hard to take off so I&#x27;ve started using CND Shellac.  FANTASTIC, but don&#x27;t let them snow you that you need the \\&quot;official\\&quot; CND light.  I use this bad boy and get two weeks of perfect wear out of my Shellac.  Love this light.  Also the OPI light is $200+ and you can only do 4 fingers at a time and thumb seperately.  lame.  LOVE THIS LIGHT</li>
    <li> Exactly what was promised by description.  Get option for the price, especially if you are an individual who will do her own nails or just starting out as a nail tech working for herself.  Portable and just the right size.</li>
    <li> This uv gel light does the job. I do my own gel polish at home. This uv nail dryer does not have a 1 minute option [really wish it did since i&#x27;m forced to count to 60 everytime, oh well]&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bulbs come a little loose so I have to adjust them and make sure that all three lights are on. I was expecting it to have bulbs on the side.&lt;br /&gt;Overall for the price it&#x27;s not a bad little nail dryer.</li>
    <li> The dryer worked once and then it would not work. It was one of my wife&#x27;s Christmas presents and I had to send it back :(</li>
    <li> My wife uses this item frequently and to date have had no issues other than making sure top light is securely locked in prior to using. She mostly does her own nails but does do friends and family nails before some big events.</li>
    <li> I love it! I am always doing ibd gel nails and it is very helpful. I got it at a great price as well. Good for beginners;)</li>
    <li> I really like this lamp, my first ever for in-home manicure. I bought this for use with CND Shellac UV gel, I got tired of paying $25 per visit for gel manicure. This lamp manufacturer description is VERY accurate, you have to clean your nails with alcohol as the final step. My nails were tacky when I finished, I blamed the lamp! until I realized the alcohol step. This lamp is light not bulky, three fluorescent lamps, can be cleaned easily, and price is very appropriate. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace the mini-UV light I had.  It was worth every penny and works beautifully.  Very easy to use and cures polish quickly.</li>
    <li> love it!  works just like the salon</li>
    <li> Fantastic works great</li>
    <li> The machine works awesome, i&#x27;m just a regular woman who wants to do her own nails to save money; my suggestion to thermal spa is to be more specifically on your safety instructions: like removing  the plastic (i don&#x27;t know what to call it) that comes inside the machine, it doesn&#x27;t come out very easily or if i should have removed it.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that i used it today March 13 for the first time and its sooo wonderful to know that this product will pay for itself, instead of me paying $30.00 just for a gel manicure, plus $5.00 for taking it out.</li>
    <li> When I got the lamp, one if the bulbs did not work. I refuse to use the lamp again until I recieve another bulb. Either that or I&#x27;m sending the lamp back.</li>
    <li> This product was just as described. I have used it multiple times now and have absolutely no complaints. This is however, my first time buying a product like this so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to. It looks like the one in the salon though. I use this with the OPI Gel Nails and while it is not an LED light, I cure them for a bit longer and they are totally fine. So far, I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love this little UV nail dryer! A couple of years ago, with a baby on the way, I decided to learn how to my own gel manicures for the sake of saving money. Looked up a few similar products but ultimately decided on this one based on a combination of features and affordability. I normally use it with CND Shellac but have also used OPI Gel polish as well and most of the time it turns out great. When it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s definitely due to user error.  I love the fact that I can easily fit both of my hands in at once and the timer options (2 mins, 3 mins, and continuous) are perfect. I&#x27;ve owned this lamp for almost two years now, haven&#x27;t had any issues, and haven&#x27;t had to replace a bulb yet. The only thing I&#x27;d change about it would be to lengthen the cord- it&#x27;s a bit on the shorter side but this hasn&#x27;t stopped me from giving myself salon-quality manicures. :)</li>
    <li> I was realy jazzed about getting this unit along with my OPI Axxium starter kit...and then was horribly disappointed.  OPI recommends 3 minutes drying time - HA!  At 20 minutes, the base hasn&#x27;t even dried and is still tacky.  Back to the drawing board!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use with OPI Gel Polish.  The first time I used it, I followed the OPI instructions exactly (kinda).  But, no matter how long I left the light on, my nails were still tacky!!!  I was NOT happy.  I was leaving them under the light for an excessive amount of time to get them to cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the problem here was ME.  I called my aunt who does nails professionally.  She asked if I wiped them w/ 91% alcohol.  I had not!  I totally forgot a step.  The OPI instructions do tell you to use their product as a final step, but I didn&#x27;t have that.  Fortunately, I was able to find 91% alcohol in the first aide section at Walmart for $1.50 (much cheaper than the suggested OPI product).  I purchased it while my nails were still tacky and collecting lint &amp; hair.  Once I got home and used the alcohol, my nails were PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the light for multiple applications and so far so good.  Just follow your polish&#x27;s instructions.  For OPI Gel: Base Coat: 1min, Polish (each coat): 2min, Top Coat: 3min.  Make sure you do THIN coats and \\&quot;cap\\&quot; the ends of your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as the lamp lasts...I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This light is awesome! It was one of the easiest things to&lt;br /&gt;set up, worked perfectly from the beginning with my gel polish and the shipping&lt;br /&gt;arrived within two days. I am thoroughly impressed. I have very large hands but&lt;br /&gt;they fit in with the machine with room to spare. Great!</li>
    <li> This nail dryer is excellent for gel nail application. It dries nails in 3 minutes and it seems like a good quality product.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to use with the Axxium soak off gel lacquer and after letting my hands sit for almost 15 minutes, it did not dry them.  They didn&#x27;t even get tacky, just remained wet.  I was very disappointed.  Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s amazing return policy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this light.  It&#x27;s compact, fits both hands or feet, and doesn&#x27;t get hot.  Set up was also very easy.  Some complain that the lights don&#x27;t work, but I think they inserted them incorrectly.  The lights need to be pushed into the receptacle until you hear a \\&quot;click.\\&quot;  If they aren&#x27;t inserted completely, you&#x27;ll end up with a shoddy connection and lights that flicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the light in conjunction with the IBD soak off gel kit.  IBD soak off gel is also easy to use and saves me $80 bi-weekly trips to the nail salon. (I was getting french mani/pedi&#x27;s)  The initial investment was about $125 for the entire manicure set (Lamp, gels, brush, etc.) but it was worth it.  I&#x27;ve made it past the learning curve and haven&#x27;t been to the nail salon in months.  WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to use at home.  My salon charges 25.00 for a nail session so this dryer will pay for itself in a few short months after adding in the cost of the base, color and top coat.  It is nice to be able to cure both hands at the same time.  I bought the CND base, CND color and CND topcoat.  My nails lasted just as long as the ones done in the salon.  I actually get tired of the color before they need redone.  Prep nails with regular rubbing alcohol (80%).  Apply base, dry 10 seconds.  Apply two coats color (thin coats), dry each coat for 2 min.  Apply topcoat, dry 2 min.  Nails will be tacky when you are finished.  Wipe with rubbing alcohol and you are ready to go!  I have used this on my nails three times so far and applied the polish to my toes once.  I believe the toes will last much longer than the 2 weeks the nails usually last.  I have also purchased a color from ProGel (pink cupcake, very cute) and used it with the CND base and CND topcoat.  It worked fine.</li>
    <li> I received this within one week and it works perfectly.  I did my nails (and my two daughters&#x27;) with the Gelish Soak-off Gels.  This lamp worked perfectly and our nails all look gorgeous.     This lamp, unlike some of the cheaper models, features the\\&quot; timer on\\&quot; button on the top of the unit.  Much handier when your nails are wet and you don&#x27;t have to reach around the back to turn it on.</li>
    <li> I purchased this UV light over a month ago for Shellac nails.  The existing lights we had in the salon were not working and curing the Shellac.  I&#x27;ve been looking around and found this one.  Can&#x27;t beat the price and the wattage!!</li>
    <li> Have used this a couple of times - so far so good! It works. It was relatively inexpensive (compared to some others). This was my second go of it. First time around one of the bulbs was inoperable, so I had to return. Makes me a bit uneasy about the quality and longevity, but I have high hopes, and so far it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there is some concern about UV exposure. I&#x27;m a big safety girl, so I bought the manicure gloves. Gotta&#x27; admit I haven&#x27;t used them yet. Instead, I just slather SPF all over my hands before using the lamp, and I feel pretty comfortable I&#x27;ll avoid cancer causing rays and the dreaded age spots!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good product. I use Shellac, so the two minute timer is perfecto. Love it.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when my package arrived. The following Saturday I sat down to start working on my nails until I realized I didn&#x27;t receive any UV bulbs for my Thermal Spa. I haven&#x27;t been able to locate to whom I need to speak to about this issue, but I&#x27;ve located where to purchase the bulbs and they&#x27;re $14.95 a piece, and it takes 3 bulbs, so that means an additional $45.00 more dollars to spend.&lt;br /&gt;As of today&#x27;s date, Amazon reimbursed me for the bulbs, even though it&#x27;s not their fault. I will keep using Amazon due to their concern about their clients. Great customer satisfaction! Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional nail artist, however enjoy getting pedicures in the summer months. I just dont Like the price tag that comes with a pedicure, that only last 7-10 days. I&#x27;ve watched nail professionals use a machine similar to this one. So, I researched and watch several Gel Nail Polish videos and techniques, and said this can&#x27;t be too hard to do at home.  I ordered this UV lamp, 1 bottle of Harmony Gelish nail polish color and 1 bottle of CND Shellac Gel nail Polish color, Harmony foundation and Harmony top coat. The price of Harmony and Shellac polish are about $12-15/bottle of nail color. You get your money&#x27;s worth with Harmony Gelish nail polish, because their bottles are twice as big (15 ml, compared to the 7.5 ml bottle Shellac has). The polishes wear the same and have the same quality, and last just as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This UV lamp works wonderfully. I&#x27;ve been impressed with this lamp. So this summer, I will not be going to the nail salon for pedicures. Both Harmony and Shellac gel polish are nice and easy to apply. I&#x27;ve done 2 pedicures on myself so far and have turned out beautifully (actually better than the professional pedicures).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steps for Gel Nails&lt;br /&gt;1. Clean nail with alcohol, nail polish remover, or apply dehydrating coat.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply foundation / base coat to nail. Cure for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply thin layer of color polish. Cure for 2 minutes. (nail will feel sticky/tacky, this is normal)&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply 2nd coat of color polish. Cure for 2 minutes. (repeat if you desire).&lt;br /&gt;5. Apply clear top coat. Cure for 2-3 minutes. (nails will feel sticky/tacky still, this is normal)&lt;br /&gt;6. Remove sticky/tacky coat by using rubbing alcohol 70% or stronger. Saturate a small piece of clean paper towel with alcohol, and wipe each nail. This will remove the sticky/tacky substance, and you will have a shiny beautiful nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal of Gel Nail Polish&lt;br /&gt;1. Saturate a cotton ball or cotton swab with 100% acetone.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply toeach nail, wrap foil around it to secure in place and leave on for 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;3. Rub at cotton ball/cotton swab as you remove it and gel polish comes off nicely. If you have a little color remaining, just get a wooden cuticle stick and rub at it and it will come right off.&lt;br /&gt;** I rather use Handsdown Soak Off Nail Wraps instead of cotton ball and foil in removing gel polish. They are much easier to use and without the mess you get when using cotton balls and foil. However, cost concerning they are expensive $25/box of 100.</li>
    <li> great product!It arrived really fast, as promised, and in good condition. My nails dry fast and my pedicure lasts twice as long as it used to.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, compact yet enough room for both hands or feet, does not take up too much room it&#x27;s an all around great deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this light in spite of the bad reviews and I am glad I did. It works very well and is a great size for both hands or feet.  I have not had the experience of the lights turning off and I have used it probably 20 times.  For home use I think it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Thermal Spa U/V light to start doing home manicures using the Harmony Gelish products.  I purchased it due to the many positive reviews on Amazon and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  I read in a couple of the reviews that there were problems with the light bulbs, but I had no problems whatsoever...in fact, I found them quite easy to put in.  The light is double-wide, so you can put two hands or two feet in at once, and the button on the top lets you choose 2 min, 3 min or continuous light. It was super easy to use -- I just select 2 minutes for the foundation coat and then 3 minutes for each coat of polish and top coat.  I purchased this and the Harmony Gelish Starter kit[[ASIN:B0057JCYYE Gelish Basix Kit]] and a light color to practice with [[ASIN:B003VMTZ8C Harmony Gelish Uv Soak Off Gel Polish -Light Elegant (0.5 Oz)]] altogether I spent around a hundred dollars, and at $36 a pop for salon gel manicures, it will pay for itself within 3 manicures.</li>
    <li> Have to press button many times to get it to respond.</li>
    <li> I have used this several times and the thermal spa is very satisfactory.  You can use it to do your toenails as well and there is room for both feet or hands at same time which reduces time.  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Professional grade product!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading some of the good reviews. I just used it today with shellac products and it worked wonderfully! I messed up with the shellac nail color because I put it on too thick, but that was not a problem with the UV dryer, that was user error! So, if you are thinking of doing your shellac or other gel nails at home I highly recommend this product. It was easy to use and worked just as well as the UV dryer in the salon.</li>
    <li> I had a professional manicure only once, and it looked good for only that day.  So I never went back.  I rarely paint my nails for the same reason - within the third day, they are cracked and chipped.    I searched for polish which didn&#x27;t crack and found shellac. I was hooked...  must... have... shellac.    I was all set to spend money on the other UV light which was twice the amount, but I instead purchased this one because of the reviews.  When I received this light, I was actually wishing I purchased the other one. But this light works GREAT!!  I \\&quot;treated\\&quot; myself to a mani and pedi a week ago, and they both still look as though I painted them today!  There is another review with instructions which I followed, even using the 70% alcohol (I didn&#x27;t have the pure alcohol on hand).  When I touched my fingernails at the end, they were tacky until I rubbed them with the alcohol.  It&#x27;s simply amazing to have beautiful nails in minutes!</li>
    <li> I live in Canada and purchase all of my beauty supplies at a profesional supplier. I was going to buy one at the supplier, but it was way out of my price range. I decided to check at Amazon and this one came up along with several others. This was exatcly what I was looking for! I was pleasently suprised when I recived it. It is very nice with all the right settings. Good quality well worth the money! I am very happy and would recomend this product to anyone using the Shelac gel products. I just wish they could have shipped this product to Canada. I was lucky to have a sister who lives im the USA.</li>
    <li> The Thermal Spa Automatic Gel Uv light is a great product.  I always had a problem with regular nail polish staying on my nails.  I would paint my nails that morning and when I took my shower at night the nail polish would just peal off.  I also had a hard time growing my nails.  using this Uv light has allowed me to keep polish on for 2 weeks and my nails have never been longer!  The polish and the Uv light keeps my nails really strong and healthy.  This is a fantastic product and you do not have to be a professional to use it.  One thing to watch is painting with this polish.  You need to push back your cuticles and make sure you do not get it on your skin as this makes the nail polish easy to peel off.  So if you want longer healthy nails and your polish to stay on for more than 3 days I would highly recommend buying this Uv light and the shellac nail polish.  You do not need to spend &amp;200 for the shellac Uv light this one works great, and you can do 2 hands or feet at once!  It only takes me about 30min to do a manicure.  Great product!  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> This product works well, most of the time, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as it should. For my fiancee, it just seems like it doesn&#x27;t dry your nails as quickly as you would expect -- which is to say, at the same rate as other times.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I just used it on the CND shellac and worked perfect!!!  I opened package and put my base coat on, not realizing I hadn&#x27;t put the bulbs in.  There is three of them.  Thought for sure i&#x27;d messed up my base coat, just one had to redo.  Works great!!!did base coat 5 secs and didn&#x27;t want color so put top coat on top of that and cured for 2 mins,.  Don&#x27;t have 90% rubbing ahcohol so used 70%, worked great!!!  I love this light very reasonable in price and has a timer that is real handy.</li>
    <li> I have NEVER been disappointed with any product I&#x27;ve ever purchased through Amazon, so this is a first.  I received this on time, installed the bulbs, plugged it in... and NOT ONE THING.  No light, No sound, Nothing.  So frustrating.  Hate hate hate.  Will never use this seller again. Plus, I was informed by Amazon that there is \\&quot;no contact info\\&quot; for seller, so I couldn&#x27;t even get in touch with them. BOOOOO!!</li>
    <li> I bought the Thermal Spa U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer so I could do Shellac at home. This works great for it, and I really like the built in timers! It is a tad larger than I was expecting (you can fit both of your feet in it), but that is actually a good thing really. I have only used it once so far, but if it craps out on me before it&#x27;s time, I will leave a comment here.  PS The bulbs COME WITH THE UNIT. They are at the bottom of the box, and you have to pull a little cardboard tab to expose them. One of the reviewers must have accidentally thrown them away.</li>
    <li> Wasted my time and money, Worked for about two seconds,then blew up. Didn&#x27;t even get to use it. Not happy</li>
    <li> I bought this to do shellac at home. I&#x27;m glad I made this choice. I&#x27;m really happy that I picked the one that can fit both hands. I can do an entire shellac manicure in about 20 minutes. I paint both hands, put them under the lamp at the same time, then repeat for all the coats.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this light.  I have been doing my own gelish mani/pedis at home and this dryer works perfectly with the rest of the gelish system.  It is definitely the best one I have seen at this price.</li>
    <li> This dryer was easy to assemble and I use it often.  I tried another one that was twice as pricey and worked half as well!</li>
    <li> This works as well as the very expensive ones.  Plus you get both hands in at once, and can do feet very easily with this one.</li>
    <li> I ordered this light for CND shellac and it works fabulously! I highly recommend this light for UV gel nail polish because it is easy to use and has enough space for both hands which saves a lot of time!</li>
    <li> Works just like it said it would.  I totally. Would recommend it to anyone doing their nails.  Follow instructions on the box of the shellac and I guarantee the results</li>
    <li> When I first looked into buying a UV nail lamp I was overwhelmed by different reviews and recommendations.  Bottom line was that I didn&#x27;t want to break the bank just to do my own shellac nails at home.  In the end I went with this product and I love it.  I haven&#x27;t had it very long but it does everything it promises.  We&#x27;ll see how long the lamps last but for the price, it has already paid for itself when compared to getting my nails done at the salon for $25 a pop!</li>
    <li> I have been doing at home gel manicures for about 4 years. My old lamp finally died and I am so grateful! This lamp is way better than my old one. I usually cure my base and top coats for 3 minutes and the color coats for 5 minutes. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had sculpted gel (OPI) nails done at a salon for years. Nice nails are about all I can do for my old-looking-even-when-I-was-young hands, which now that I&#x27;m old, really look dreadful. Wrinkles, plus crooked fingers, plus nails wrecked in various ways over the years and now VERY ridgey. They never grew well, were thin and dry, flat, and deep in the nail-bed. Sculpted gel was made for hands like mine! I also work very hard with my hands, outdoors and in, and I keep large animals. So I&#x27;m a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But keeping up the gel sculpting gets expensive (!), and since I want my nails short, sometimes doesn&#x27;t seem worth it. I&#x27;ve wanted to try lacquer, but my nail tech said my nails weren&#x27;t good enough for it. I began reading up on DIY gel and shellac here in the Amazon reviews, anyway, and I finally decided to try it out. Somewhere I&#x27;d read that the shellac concealed ridges, and though I really didn&#x27;t believe it, I thought I&#x27;d see if it at least helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this UV light, base and top coat, color, all from Amazon (CND). My gel sculpting isn&#x27;t completely grown out, though parts of it have broken and chipped off, and other pretty things. I couldn&#x27;t soak it off with 100% acetone, and I finally decided to file off as much as I could (carefully), make sure there were no loose edges, etc. and go right over what was left. (I know. I&#x27;ll watch it carefully.) One nail was already a mess because the gel had torn off a good hunk of nail surface, and the others, as I set out to begin, were uneven and rough. I acetoned everything, and I scrubbed with alcohol, and then I went ahead and followed directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, everything, including this light, worked exactly as they were supposed to, in the time required: 10 sec, 2 mins, 2 mins. I didn&#x27;t do a great job, but good enough, and the big news is: IT LEVELS OUT RIDGES AND OTHER \\&quot;IMPERFECTIONS.\\&quot; You would never know, looking at my nails today, what they look like underneath! Thank you to all thepeople who gave me info here. I am so glad to be able to do this now at home and have such nice results.</li>
    <li> Very nice! Works great! The bulbs are very good quality. The item is very good quality. I would recommend it to someone else.</li>
    <li> Great price and exactly like the salons use daily. I highly recommend it, just keep your fingers from the bulbs!</li>
    <li> So DISAPPOINTED!  I have no idea of performance of this product. Ordered from this site because they guaranteed&lt;br /&gt;It would be delivered 2days later.  Yes I did get it then, BUT it came without bulbs!  Can you imagine that?&lt;br /&gt;Next day still no bulbs. I have lost 7 appointments to  apply  Gel Nails.  I still don&#x27;t have bulbs  Hopefully&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow!  Machine is very nice and looks very sturdy. Sure I will love it, when it get bulbs to me.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product and works well with shellac. It does get pretty warm under the light though and I wish it had a fan.</li>
    <li> I received my lamp, went to use it an nothing happened...went to check the bulbs and there weren&#x27;r any.  No where in the order did it tell me that the lamp didn&#x27;t come with bulbs.  It gave me the \\&quot;REPLACMENT Bulb\\&quot; part number.  So when ordering this lamp make sure to order the bulbs as well.</li>
    <li> WORKS!  Sooo much cheaper than other brands but it works just as well as those salon dryers.  The brand marking on the top of the dryer, written in blank in, did come off a bit... must have touched it with the pure acetone used to take off the gel polish.</li>
    <li> Does cure shellac polish. Came with an extra bulb. Lightweight. A little bigger than I thought, but fits both hands sooo... Glad I saved the money vs. Purchasing the CND lamp.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 8/2013 Lamp is still working great, cures everything, fits two hands and feet, highly recommend</li>
    <li> Bought the spa to save on manicures and it was a wonderful purchase. It has paid for itself in two uses.   It is easy to use and is large enough to do both hands and both feets although not all at the same time.  Pam</li>
    <li> this sets the hellish polish very well. My daughter loves that it fits two hands perfectly. made well. looks great on the table. looks very professional.</li>
    <li> I bought this device for my friend who had been doing her nails the old fashioned way.  This device has opened a WHOLE NEW WORLD for her.  It is amazing how well your nails come out when you use it with the appropriate base and topcoat.  Just follow the directions and it is a snap.</li>
    <li> This was a great find. I&#x27;ve had mine for more than a year and it still works great. I prefer to do my nails at home and this makes the drying process a lot faster.</li>
    <li> The nail spa was missing the bulbs, and the cord to plug it in.  It looks like a great product, and was excited to receive it, but because of missing parts, unable to use!</li>
    <li> Works good but lights burn out quickly, love doing my nails myself and it paid for itself quickly because the $30 each time at the nail saloon was  ruining my budget.However I don&#x27;t like the lights, the originals burned out quickly, found I could still get a nice seal with 2 active lights but they are difficult to replace especially when trying to do so with a cloth  covering my fingertips so the oil from my hands wouldn&#x27;t touch the bulb. I liked that I could do two hands at once and even my toes fit into the wide opening for Pedi&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> This may take a few seconds longer than other ones, but it works great for the price.  I was paying a lot of money to have this done at the salon, but now I can do it at home and I really like it.  I would say the things to keep in mind are thinner coats and when you are done and before you start wipe alcohol on your nails, I think before you start it helps hold the polish and after it takes all the tacky off...DON&#x27;T be afraid to wipe your finished nails pretty hard.</li>
    <li> If it hadn&#x27;t come with a broken light bulb i&#x27;m pretty sure it would be a good buy, so i returned it and odered another one. I really liked the size and love the self-timer. Before returning it; I used it once to cure my gelish polish by rigging the bulb with a piece of paper and the finish came out perfectly. Replacement bulbs are like $20 on Amazon, but if your only using it for you and maybe some close friends I assume you wouldn&#x27;t have to change them often. When my new one arrives I will be back with an update on my feelings about this light and the seller.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to do my own nails at home using the CND Shellac system and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. I read the mixed reviews and have not had any problems with the unit not working correctly or the bulbs not fitting properly. My nails come out great without the expense or time to go to a salon. I love that I can easily cure both hands or feet at the same time. When doing nails at home this is a time saver. Curing time is as instructed on the product: 10 sec for base coat, 2 min for each color coat and 2 min for the top coat. The nails feel sticky after curing, which is normal, and after wiping with 99% isopropal alcohol on a cotton pad, they are shiny and beautiful. I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to try doing their own nails at home.</li>
    <li> O.K. so I am a total novice and bought this on a whim after reading a few reviews. First off this thing is light, easy to use and worked perfectly. The gel polish is easy to put on (haven&#x27;t tried to take it off yet), 10 minutes and done. Can&#x27;t wait to do my toes!! I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even worth spending 1 more cent for a \\&quot;better\\&quot; dryer, this one works just fine. My nails cured in a total of 5 minutes (all steps combine). A+! i will never pay another nail salon to do gel polish again!</li>
    <li> I use this to do gel nails at home and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. A normal set of gel nails in the salon is easily $45 - 50 with tip. This UV practically pays for itself.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because of all of the rave reviews.  What I have found after 3 or 4 tries is that the lights are not strong enough (at least in my limited experience) to set the gel in 2-3 minutes.  When I use very thin layers and allow the polish to cure for a minimum of 8 minutes each layer, then I have no problems.  It takes a long time to finish my nails this way, but the alternative is much more expensive (I do use UV protection b/c of the long exposure)  I just recently changed my toe polish after a month.  I would not have had to except for growth!</li>
    <li> This UV light is large enough to cure both your hands and feet at the same time. This will save you a lot of time!!</li>
    <li> This is a great option if you like the flexibility of doing your nails at home.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 years and it held up great.  The automatic timing is so convenient and makes the process so easy.</li>
    <li> Great for professional results at home! A year later it is still working like new! I haven&#x27;t even had to replace the bulbs yet, which some what concerned me when buying initially</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing for hardening the nails</li>
    <li> The thermal spa does not put out enough heat to dry nails in the time recommended in the enclosed directions.</li>
    <li> This was for my first time using shellac nail polish. I&#x27;ve used it a few times now, in conjunction with [[ASIN:B0057JCYYE Gelish Basix Kit]] and [[ASIN:B00762XOA8 Harmony Gelish Magneto - Electric Metal Lover .5 Oz. W/free Matching Magnet Lacquer]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought it took more time than instructed under the light to cure polish (and other layers). Not necessarily true. The polish is generally tacky until you finish with Nail Surface Cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the light.</li>
    <li> This UV light is spacious and works great with the CND shellac products. I was worried because it wasn&#x27;t an expensive UV light that it wouldn&#x27;t do a good job, but it does great! The polish will feel tacky after you cure it in the lamp, just put all your coats on (base, color and topcoat) and then wipe your nails with a little isopropyl alcohol on a cotton ball to take the tackiness off the top coat and you are good to go!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading the below reviews.  I followed the steps as outlined in the other reviews and Shellac instructions.  This is the best priced, and biggest sized of all the ones I saw...  I am very pleased with this lamp, and how it works.  My Shellac nails look great.  This works just as well as getting it done in a salon as long as you know how to paint your own nails.  Make sure you dont throw away the bulbs which were in the bottom of the box.</li>
    <li> This works great for curing Harmony Gelish polishes.  I probably would have been fine just having a one-hand machine, but in the event I ever to my feet, this will come in handy.  A friend of mine warned that UV lights from these machines can cause skin damage if you do your nails often.  I don&#x27;t know how true that is, I suppose so...I&#x27;m going to start slathering on some SPF though just to be safe.</li>
    <li> Perfect Size &amp; Works Great! It&#x27;s the same one that my local nail salon uses to do their customer&#x27;s nails. You don&#x27;t need to spend more than $60 on a Gel Dryer, I&#x27;ve read a few reviews and forums and some people say to purchase them around $100 min but that is not true.. Don&#x27;t waste your money on an expensive one. This one is big enough for both of your hands and feet to fit. If you put it together and it don&#x27;t turn on it&#x27;s because you didn&#x27;t clip in the light bulbs properly.. re-insert and you are good to go. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> For me, this UV lamp has worked perfectly.  It is huge, easily fits two hands, with thumbs, at the same time.  It has 3 18-watt bulbs, and a nice mirrored inside.  I use Chinese AODL gel (a soak off \\&quot;builder\\&quot;) and 3 min cures it perfectly.  I&#x27;ve used the lamp several times over a 3 week period and it continues to work as expected.  I&#x27;ll update the review if anything goes wrong (shorts, early blown bulbs, etc.) but as for now, I&#x27;ve found it to be as high a quality as lamps costing 4 times as much.</li>
    <li> I received my lamp yesterday. The bulbs come with this and are very easy to pop into place. I plugged in and wham! I ordered the CND base coat and top coat and a couple of OPI gel colors. I did my first at home shellac manicure yesterday and perfect! Not a single complaint at all!! I cured the polish for 2 minutes in between each coat!! Also I did my toes and the lamp is perfectly big enough to place both feet in, but I was only doing one hand/foot at a time. I am so happy I bought this for myself!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the money, it only has 3 functions but it workbetter than my old ibd.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time, all the parts are in good shape.</li>
    <li> This is terrific. I have not had any problems at all and it works perfectly every time. Professional quality and large capacity.</li>
    <li> Exploded on me, will never buy again</li>
    <li> Extremely delighted but landed up having to get a step up transformer to 240v to use in South Africa through my own fault for not checking prpoerly</li>
    <li> I had problems with this lamp shutting off unexpectedly soon after I bought it.  It lasted less than 2 years before breaking completely.  Very cheaply made. I would not buy it again</li>
    <li> This product is great. Instructions provided with the gel polish say leave hand in for 60sec but you need to leave it in longer.</li>
    <li> System or unit doesn&#x27;t work as good as other systems I&#x27;ve used.kind of big and bulky.didn&#x27;t seal the gel as well as other products used</li>
    <li> I use this with the Harmony Gellish products for my gel manicure.  The lamp works great, and it&#x27;s reasonably priced!  It&#x27;s roomy enough so you can comfortably do both hands at once, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.  If you get rough with it, the bulbs will pop out, but it&#x27;s easy to pop back in.  Totally a great buy!</li>
    <li> This UV light has three internal lights and is priced very reasonably. The UV surface is large enough to fit both feet in, if you&#x27;re doing an at-home pedicure with gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of years in my home, and I have not had a light blow out yet. This is actually a better lamp than the one my sister-in-law has. She&#x27;s a beautician, and her model of UV light will let you do only one hand at a time. That&#x27;s okay, if you have someone else doing your nails and working on one hand while you put the other under the light. But if you&#x27;re doing yourself, this light is far better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen the new LED versions you can get at Walgreens, where you stick one finger in at a time for 10 seconds, but then you&#x27;re under the light 100 seconds for each coat. Why not just do the entire coat on both hands and use the lamp for 2 minutes? You might be saving 20 seconds per coat and some money with the LED, but this seems more practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was telling a woman about this yesterday, when she said that she was spending way too much money on manicures. For the amount of money you will save on a gel manicure, this will pay for itself in five visits.</li>
    <li> I wanted to do shellac at home and I didn&#x27;t want to buy the cheapest product, or the most expensive product. This machine was on sale at a great price, and had great ratings, so I ordered it. I got mine and I tried it out right away! The machine works wonderfully! It dries my shellac in the recommended time and so far everything is so good. It doesn&#x27;t tell you how to install the bulbs, which I thought was odd, but other than that I give it 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> My nail dryer did not come with the bulbs. I am still trying to track down the correct size bulbs.</li>
    <li> I recently started doing gel polish myself.  This is a very good quality U/V light dryer.  And the Amazon price was the best on the web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is simple to use and easy to store on a shelf when not in use.</li>
    <li> Light works great! Used it 5 times already and worked PERFECTLY all 5 times. Other reviewers gave bad reviews based on tacky nails and light bulbs. Be sure to use 99% alcohol after final step; your nails should feel tacky until you do this! The lights bulbs should click into place when you install them. LOVE this light! Works just as good as the light my former nail tech uses! :)</li>
    <li> I recieved the product but it did not come with a plug in cord, so therefore it is useless. I contacted the seller but they were of no help. So now im stuck with a cordless, useless uv lamp!</li>
    <li> It works just fine and dries regular polish in 2-3 minutes. My only complaint is that the power cord has a hard time staying connected to the back of the unit. It&#x27;s a very loose connection and any movement drops the cord right out.</li>
    <li> I know once I can use this product I will love it and give it 5 stars. My friend has one just like this. But I am unable to use it because it doesn&#x27;t come with the lights. Maybe I am wrong or dumb but I was always pretty sure a product sold online or even in the store is supposed to tell you what IS included and what is NOT included. And this description does NOT tell you you are spending $50 just for a dome and a cord with no lights. Which makes it useless unless U go and spend another wad of cash for the lights. I am sure I can find a seller who includes the lights. Bottom line....unless I&#x27;m missing something on this page or my product had a missing item....this item DOES NOT include the uv lights! It is useless without them.</li>
    <li> Works fine and haven&#x27;t had any issues with CND polishes under this UV light, however two of the bulbs constantly need tweaking and I have to visually check to make sure it&#x27;s lighted up when I turn on.  Most of the time it&#x27;s not, and I have to take out and put back in again several times to get a good connection of bulb to connector.</li>
    <li> I have been doing nails for years, this light is nice the opening is big and is great for both hands or both feet! great find for the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for eight months and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It works well and arrived as described. It was a great purchase for doing my own gel nails.</li>
    <li> Initially unit kept flickering and would not dry nails.  Removed all the lights and put them back in and replaced one that kept going out.  Unit now works but overheats if left on continuous.  For the price it does the job.</li>
    <li> I went to a local salon for a CND Shellac manicure and loved it, so I thought I&#x27;d try it on my own. I tried this lamp and loved it...it&#x27;s true that you don&#x27;t need to purchase a lamp that costs 3 or 4 times as much. With this lamp, I got the same two weeks of wear that I got spending $40 for someone else to do them. I&#x27;ve done 3 manicures, so far, and I am totally happy with this purchase. I love that I can put both hands/feet in at once...a real time saver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this less than half a year and used it maybe 10 times. It&#x27;s already not working. Something with the plug. I can&#x27;t believe how poor the quality is for this machine. No refunds too. At least let me exchange for a working one!!</li>
    <li> Perfect and good price</li>
    <li> The nail dryer was big enough for both hands and the nails were dry in 3 minutes. I was impressed at how nice her looked. Just like the professionals!</li>
    <li> She and her friends are enjoying it.  This was her main wish for her birthday..  I don&#x27;t live close enough to know how often it is used but it came in a timely manner and works well--and easily.</li>
    <li> Everything is good besides the fact that I have to push in the lights for them to turn on. I&#x27;m not sure if the plastic things that hold the light are loose but every time I turn the machine on a bulb or two don&#x27;t light up so I have push them in more.</li>
    <li> My wife used them and really enjoyed them they were very nice, and would recommend them to anyone that does nails.</li>
    <li> Bought this thinking I would save some money.  Worked great at first but after two uses the bulbs would fall out.  One set of the three bulbs is already not working tried to replace it but still won&#x27;t work.  Not impressed will be shopping for a new one this week</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  I&#x27;m saving a LOT of money for professional manicures and keeping my nails looking nice.</li>
    <li> I just love my Thermal Spa UV light!  It only takes 2 minutes and my nails are dry.  I would definitely suggest you buy one for yourself!</li>
    <li> The Thermal Spa worked as expected. I use it with the Gelish polishes from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. The 2 minute timer is perfect for curing the different layers of polish. If you want an enexpensive UV lamp system that cures polish as advertised, the Thermal Spa won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> Yes this does what its suppose to do as long as you know how to use gel polish correctly&lt;br /&gt;-buff top layer of nail off&lt;br /&gt;-cleanse with alcohol&lt;br /&gt;-use pH bonder&lt;br /&gt;-one thin layer of base coat(cure 2mins)&lt;br /&gt;-one thin layer of color(cure 3mins)&lt;br /&gt;-repeat above step&lt;br /&gt;-one thin layer of top coat(cure 2mins)&lt;br /&gt;-wipe off tackiness with alcohol&lt;br /&gt;each layer will remain tacky after curing&lt;br /&gt;The problem is the lights fall out constantly while curing polish epic fail totally annoying but like I said it works.</li>
    <li> This lamp is awesome.  I use Artisan gel builder on my nails and this lamp cures it in about 5 seconds, no joke.  It also completely cures every brand of gel polish I have tried in the 2 minute setting.  I have yet to even need the higher settings.  The opening is totally wide enough for two hands at a time which saves me a lot of time and it&#x27;s built well.  The lamps were super easy to install, no akward positioning like I&#x27;ve had in other lamps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a lamp for your salon or for home, this is definitely a great choice, especially for the price.  54W is a lot of power for so little money.  This is NOT an ad, I am a real person, in case I sounded a bit promotional.</li>
    <li> I thought I ordered the same one as my friend&#x27;s but it&#x27;s not.  Works great but takes a little longer to cure</li>
    <li> Had for short time and seems to work well however i needed a adaptor/convertor for Australian power.</li>
    <li> Works very well and leaves my nails looking professionally done! I get complements on them all the time!!!! I love that it fits both hands or feet in at the same time! Its great! Just make sure you push the lights in all the way...it doesn&#x27;t work well when only one of them it on : ) haha</li>
    <li> I brought this machine for me and my daughter to do our own nail and it is worth every penny</li>
    <li> Works very well with the OPI Polish.  A little difficult to put bulbs in place, otherwise an excellent product. I love it</li>
    <li> Does the job! It&#x27;s perfect. I use it at home &amp; my gel manicures and pedicures look as if I did them in the salon &amp; lasts for days. Of course, you must buy good quality gel nail polish to go along this or your polish will chip, as with any other UV light machine.</li>
    <li> Love this Nail dryer. Its worth the money. Just stick both hands or feet in at the same time. Cuts your time in half doing mani/ pedi.</li>
    <li> Works Great! Was given this as a birthday gift about a year ago along with OPI Gelcolor polishes and use it all the time. Although I get a manicure every two weeks, often I decide to &#x27;fix&#x27; a nail if I get a crack. Sometimes I just decide to change colors. The Gelcolors are avalable on Amazon, so having this double wide UV nail dryer makes it easy. Evidently they have upped the watts to 45 (from 36) so now it will take even less time between coats. I have yet to need new bulbs or had any issues at all. I highly recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> After spending $50 to have shellac done at my local nail salon, I opted to buy the machine and do it myself.  This machine was on sale so I got a great deal.  I also do shellac on my toes and can put both feet in the dryer at the same time.  That saves me time and money.  If you&#x27;re considering it, I say go for it.</li>
    <li> Works like I expected</li>
    <li> I have had 100% success with this Nail Dryer, it is the perfect size to do both hands at the same time.. and it is lightweight and easy to transport and store.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think  you  will find a better Nail Dryer for the price.  Works great. Has 3 - 18 watt bulbs for a total wattage of 54 watts.  Lots of room for both hands.</li>
    <li> I started doing my nails at home, I use this with Shellac products and I use it with regular nail polish when I take a break from the Shellac.</li>
    <li> This item works really well for gel nail application.  The only issue is that the bulbs get lose and you have to push them back in place.  other than that it works great!</li>
    <li> Glad I can use this product at home and not have to spend time at the salon.  It is more affordable that way.  Plenty of room for my nails.  I especially like the timer, so that I can watch TV while waiting for the polish to cure.</li>
    <li> Just received it and used it within 10 minutes of removing it from the box. I love how you can get both hands under it at a time, since the gel nails are such a process that I know I wouldn&#x27;t use it as much if I had to wait out both hands (plus the thumbs!). I do wish that it has a one minute timer on it, but for the price I can definitely deal with it. It was a great buy!</li>
    <li> I really like this nail dryer. It dries my nails relatively quickly and I can dry both hands at one time, or my feet.</li>
    <li> I tried putting in the bulbs which was hard, but none of them would turn on! and the box did NOT come with instructions. This dryer is huge BTW. I was disappointed. So much for Thermal Spa brand  products, I will stay away. I returned and ordered a totally different one, hope that one works.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with some shellac polish. This works awesome with the shellac and is a great buy compared to everything else I saw online.</li>
    <li> After researching these nail dryers I chose this one based on the reviews.  You can not beat this for the price and size.  It works great with gelish system.  I love it!!  No more going to the salon for me to get my nails done.  I can change and decorate my nails all I want from home now!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for personnel use. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money going to nail salons that I just got tried of it. It works like a champ. I&#x27;ve never done my own nails before, but this thing has giving me hope.  Really easy to use and portable. Love it. :)!</li>
    <li> Lights didn&#x27;t work. Had to returned it. At least didn&#x27;t have problem getting my refund. They don&#x27;t come with spare lights.</li>
    <li> I would give it no stars if possible, I am so very disappointed in this dryer.  I have only used it three (3) times, it doesn&#x27;t work at all now.&lt;br /&gt;It did not even pay for itself in home usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FIRST time I used it, one of the lights was flickering on and off; I removed it from the sockets and put it back in.  It worked well.  The SECOND time I used it, the light would not come on at all no matter what I tried.  The THIRD time I used it two of the three lights did not work!  Needless to say, my gel polish did not dry properly.  It is now past the time for me to return it, thus, the review.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product at my store ,so far it works good. I will recommend to my friend.</li>
    <li> I decided to bite the bullet and invest in a light so I could do my gel manicures at home. After reading reviews of all the lights available I chose this one. Not only did it have great reviews, when you are doing your own nails, it&#x27;s fantastic for saving time because you can paint both hands then cure both hands at the same time. I love it!! Well worth the extra ten dollars! I also love the options to do 2, 3 or continuous minutes. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love it great power cures gel nicely great price and you can put 2 hands in I would recommend this dryer for home use</li>
    <li> When I bought this I thought it was expensive but I love this product. It was totally worth the money in the end.</li>
    <li> Very good and durable</li>
    <li> I was very very skeptical and the reviews didnt help with that either, but I took a chance and order one that had a torn box but it works perfect cures with no problem and is very big you can do both hands at the same time with no problem</li>
    <li> Great light.  Still tickin after several uses!</li>
    <li> I just watched a ton of videos on how to gel polish one weekend and decided that I can do this myself since my work hours don&#x27;t allow me to take time to go to a salon. I was so surprised at how easy it is! This light works absolutely as described! Look no further!</li>
    <li> I love this UV light! It was easy to put together, I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and it works great, and it saves so much money over getting a pro manicure. I cannot recommend this enough!</li>
    <li> So worth the price when you consider it costs about as much as a couple of professional gel manicures for the Thermal Spa light. And now gel polishes are even available at CVS and other stores. I like buying polishes online however for better color selection. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this light but, its the Best purchase I&#x27;ve made doin nails. Cooks the gel all the way and fast.</li>
    <li> My girls &amp; I, including my nieces love this product! We use it all the time. I would recommend this item for those who prefer to do their nails at home.</li>
    <li> Love being able to do my own nails in the comfort of my own home.  Great choice for me.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I just got this lamp and I love it.I had a little bit trouble placing the lamp inside,but after trying maybe 3 times finally I got the last one on its place.For my first gel manicure I  used  two lamps and it worked perfect.From now on I won&#x27;t be paying $40 for manicure at the salon.Great product.!</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made !  Paid for itself after 3 uses. Double width allows you to bake both hands at the same time. Whole process takes just minutes. Well worth the buy!  Nicer than the ones I&#x27;ve seen in several different salons</li>
    <li> Light works great.  Has been a great light while learning how to do gel nails myself.  I love the convenience of having it at home to do nails.  Light dries gel great. Very happy with product and would buy again.  Great size for both hands or feet,</li>
    <li> My husband used it ....his teeth are very dark one treatment make a huge difference ...he is going to do another treatment to make them even whiter.</li>
    <li> I have only used it a couple of times but so far so good.  I just have to be careful when I put my hands into the opening to keep them flat so I don&#x27;t bump the lights.  The reason I purchased it was because I liked the idea of doing both hands at the same time, which saves time.</li>
    <li> I really like this light. It works pretty well. I found that I have to use the 3 min option though since I have found that the 2 min option doesnt dry the shellac completely. I also gave it only 4 stars because I havent had this very long and one of the lights already needs replacing. which is a huge bummer. Otherwise, its super simple- plug it in, turn it on, and set the time desired to dry your nails. Overall I am happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> None of the bulbs worked that came with the product.  Amazon made it right but I still have to order the bulbs and this birthday gift for a friend is still not being used by her.  I would have thought the seller would make this correct but they say it was amazing problem basically so i thank you for doing what you did.</li>
    <li> Wife was happy and loved the product to save money vs going to nail salon and would purchase it again</li>
    <li> Great dryer, exactly as described. It has lots of room inside and is just like the salon dryers.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> my manicurist has this. this was an amazing price for this substantial and well made product. you cant get better than this! tons of lights  reflective insides and bottom, settings for time -and both hands at the same time with plenty of room. totally the best.</li>
    <li> She has found it very useful for quickly drying nail polish. She said it is easy yo set up and use.</li>
    <li> My wife seems pleased with the gift, and is now using it to do her own nails.  She feels that in time she will become more adept at the procedure.</li>
    <li> Love it works perfect!!</li>
    <li> The product/equipment was faulty and did not function at all. Not impressed with that but was impressed with the follow-up service re refund. This experience will not deter me from buying from you as with all things, some work and some don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love this i did my nails and it dry fast like , Like i went to the nail place most have love!!!! Excellent service as well everything was on time...</li>
    <li> Unfortunately upon arrival two of the three bulbs will not keep contact and will not stay on. Cheap junk. I don&#x27;t recommend at all. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> This light works great plus works with shellac and gel. I thought I ordered the LED lamp but didn&#x27;t, it was my mistake. Kept it and glad I did. The lamp is large and roomy can fit both hands or feet with room to spare. Takes a couple of minutes longer per cure but I&#x27;m not having a problem with that.</li>
    <li> I love this light! I used to work in a salon and we used the CND uv light which was fine, but this one is big enough to dry both hands at once. The light cures the same as the cnd and I just use the two minute setting for each coat. Thanks, I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a UV lamp to cure IBD Gel Nail products, and this one looked like a great price compared to the cheap looking more expensive ones I&#x27;ve seen in beauty supply stores. I didn&#x27;t think I needed two hands to fit (since I can only sculp one hand at a time) but I actualy love it, I don&#x27;t have to worry about bumping the sides and its comfortable, plus I cured the top coat for both hands at the same time and I&#x27;m going to do my toes. I had no problem installing the lights and it worked perfecty. Its really powerful, wow its bright, so I cover the top with a little hand towle and just really carefuly fold it down after I get my hand in there so I&#x27;m not staring at the UV light. I also love the little lift on the top, you can&#x27;t see it in the picture but you just put your fingers under it and its like a handle you can pick it up with one hand. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, I feel like I have the same lamp I used in the salon when I paid to get my nails done. And it cures just like I would expect one too.</li>
    <li> What I didn&#x27;t see when I ordered was that bulbs aren&#x27;t included (you need three). The dryer looks good though and big enough for both hands.</li>
    <li> I am a nail technician&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages: I bought it for around $50 but I can use for both hands in the same time, is has a good shape. There is some another machine around $30 but for only one hand and look ugly. CND is very excellent because there is time display but very expensive around $120. This machine is excellent for home using and normal at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantage: because of no time display, I cannot work speedy as same as I am using any UV dryer with time display. Otherwise, the control panel is set up for user, instead of nail technicians. So it recommends for home more than for professional. One kind of DIY (Do it by your self). More over, the light bulbs are set up in top and front, not on both sides, so thumb nails oft get messy or cannot be done well ... Terrible for stater or beginner, who don&#x27;t have experience of nail technic</li>
    <li> Bought this to do my own in house mani/pedis. Works great! Packaging was good but would reccomend that the bulbs also be enclosed in buble wrap as added measure for breakage. Mine came with everything in tact &amp; no breakage. Lights were easy to install. Would have liked to have seen a address or link for replacement bulbs within seller&#x27;s website. Overall this was a great buy. Happy with my choice.</li>
    <li> This is the exact one the ladies at the nail salon used when I paid to have gel nails.  Found the gel nail products elsewhere and have been doing my own ever since.  Takes a bit longer for me since I only do one hand at a time but still a money saver overall.</li>
    <li> Great machine great price</li>
    <li> last longer than I expected. Just need to replace the buds and you are good to go</li>
    <li> Love this nail dryer!  This is the second one I have purchased.  The first one was for myself back in November and the most recent one I purchased is for my sister.  It has saved me big $$$ on shellacing my nails plus I love being able to do it on my own schedule at home.  I use CND shellac polish with it and it usually lasts between 12 - 16 days, depending on how much work I am doing with my hands.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I purchased this UV dryer.  I just wanted to leave a little more feedback on this dryer in regards to shellac nail polish. I bought this product to do my own nails. I am not a nail tech, but fully capable of doing my own nails.  So here is what I did, I purchased the shellac scrub fresh nail prep, shellac UV base coat, shellac red barroness nail color, shellac UV top coat and this dryer all from Amazon sellers. Here is what I did step by step and it worked.&lt;br /&gt;1. Follow Shellac&#x27;s instruction on how to prep nails and use products-go to their website.  I shape my nails and cuticles, then use scrub fresh to clean and dehydrate.&lt;br /&gt;2. SHAKE the UV base coat for two minutes and paint both hands!  I didn&#x27;t shake well the the first time and the base coat and nail color came out too thick.&lt;br /&gt;3. I put nails under light to cure for 30 seconds.  Nails will feel tacky (not dry) and this is normal. Has to do with oxygenation with curing.&lt;br /&gt;4. Shake color -paint one coat of color on both hands and put under light for two minutes-nails will feel tacky. This is normal.&lt;br /&gt;5. Shake color-paint second coat of color on both hands and put under light for two minutes-nails will feel tacky.  This is normal.&lt;br /&gt;6. Shake top coat-paint top coat on nails-place under dryer for two minutes.  Use 99% alcohol to remove tacky layer on top coat.  I used 70% alcohol pads and this worked fine!  A tiny bit of nail color streak came off on alcohol pad but I continued on removing tacky layer.  When I was finished, nails were perfectly cured.  Polish has been on for 10 days and still look brand new. If nails lose their shine due to lotion...-wife off with alcohol pad and they look brand new.&lt;br /&gt;7. When ready to take off-either soak off with 100%acetone on cotton balls with aluminum foil or soak fingers in acetone.  I wouldn&#x27;t bother with the CND pad removers.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line-this lamp works great for Shellac nails-no need to buy $200 plus one.  You will read so many mixed reviews about why you shouldn&#x27;t be doing it yourself and using anything but the CND dryer, but this is what worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luckso many mixed reviews about why you shouldn&#x27;t be doing it yourself and using anything but the CND dryer, but this is what worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck</li>
    <li> This item is worth the money if you like UV gel top coats. Works great and you will spend less in the long run!</li>
    <li> I have only used it once so far as I just got it and the uv gel for my nails so time will tell if this is a good product but so far its been impressive. It cured my nails no problem and its really big so I could basically get both hands in at the same time if I needed to. The bulbs were easy to install and it gave me professional looking results. I would recommend this light for someone who works in the field or just wants a good long lasting one to use at home for your nails.</li>
    <li> This is a UV lamp for use with any type polish that requires UV curing.&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Works for ANY soak off gel nail polish (as far as I know)&lt;br /&gt;3 each 18 watt bulbs included for total of 54 watts of power &#x3D; fast curing time&lt;br /&gt;Bulbs are easily replaceable - (item PAR414)&lt;br /&gt;Roomy interior with space for both hands or feet at once to speed up SOG manicure time.&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of space for feet to fit inside without bulbs touching your foot&lt;br /&gt;Convenient hand grip in top easy to carry&lt;br /&gt;Timer is easy toggle press for increments of auto-off in 2min - 3min or Continuous operation&lt;br /&gt;Interior clear plastic protector can be cleansed/disinfected between uses&lt;br /&gt;Quality Construction&lt;br /&gt;Reflective surface inside well placed&lt;br /&gt;Quiet operation&lt;br /&gt;Cord is removable from base unit - handy for storage&lt;br /&gt;Price is right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Cord is a bit short, I had to use an extension cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use mine with Harmony brand \\&quot;Gelish\\&quot; soak off gel polish - which is a hybrid gel with nail polish color in it that comes in regular nail polish bottle style containers. I am a huge fan of Gelish, but this lamp will work for all brands Shellac, Gelaration, etc. Please see your polish makers web site for the proper times for each coat.</li>
    <li> I purchased this light for use with Gelish nail polish.  It worked excellent.  Dried the gel polish in two minutes.  The larger size is great.  I only did one had at a time but two would have fit easily.  This will be great for toes, too!</li>
    <li> This is the first UV lamp I came across on amazon, and after reading all the positive reviews I decided to purchase it w/o looking any further.  I&#x27;m so glad I did! This lamp is perfect for shellac method, and the price was just right.  The size makes it possible to do both hands at the same time which saves you so much time. Great Product!!!</li>
    <li> This baby is big, but I can fit both of my hands in it.  It makes for a quick manicure!  I&#x27;d love for the manufacturer to make a 1 min time too.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed Nail Tech and this lamp is terrible for Shellac. First of all, it isn&#x27;t even the correct wattage that is supposed to be used for Shellac. It is cheaper for a reason, and provides less than professional results. If you&#x27;re not going to apply and cure Shellac properly, you&#x27;re best not using it at all. For those of you who are nail professionals using this lamp, you should become properly trained in Shellac. For those of you non-professionals using this at home for Shellac, it&#x27;s meant to be applied by a properly trained, licensed technician for a reason! Perhaps this light is okay for other products or brands, but it just doesn&#x27;t cut it when it comes to Shellac.</li>
    <li> The lamp is lovely but I don&#x27;t think it is doing the curing job as I anticipated it would.  My nails come out somewhat sticky and I know I am doing the process correctly.  The price got me on this one -- it was really reasonable</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could do my own gel nails (I use CND Shellac).  For the price I figured it would be worth a try given how expensive the manicures are.  I have now done 2 full polishes using this UV gel light.  It works great.  It does not have the 10 second timer for the base coat but that is easy enough to count for yourself.  If you are wanting to do the gel nails yourself I highly recommend this UV gel light.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent light, you can fit both hands at once and I love the way you can set different times. This was well worth the money</li>
    <li> I ordered this item in July and it has never worked write.  Unable to return it. You think there would be a warranty on it longer than a month.  I had ordered one a few years ago and it worked forever.  I guess its the chance you take.  I will never order this item again.</li>
    <li> This dryer does the job for my gel manicures.  It&#x27;s a bit large, but I could fit both hands in it if I wanted, or even my feet.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!  It&#x27;s sturdy and has a nice handle at the top to easily transport it, though I keep mine in a plastic bin with my other manicure supplies, so the handle isn&#x27;t used much.</li>
    <li> What a great size and easy to use Nail dryer/Light. I am so pleased to have this. I cannot imagine going back to a one hand at a time dryer. THANK You so much for this awesome UV/Dryer. I will recommend it to all my gal pals. Seller is HIGHLY Recommended too. A True asset to all.</li>
    <li> THIS lamp works great.  Same as salon, now I&#x27;m saving so much money on mani and pedi! ! For those who say the Polish stays tacky, you have to wipe your nails down with alcohol when you are done with your top coat.  The same thing they do at the salon.</li>
    <li> One of the lights needs a bit of TLC to work. Otherwise, meets my needs.</li>
    <li> Such a great purchase!!!  My hubby got me this for Mother&#x27;s Day 1.5 yrs ago and I LOVE it!  Same one my salon uses so I know it&#x27;s good.  I use it all the time and still haven&#x27;t had to replace any bulbs.</li>
    <li> great value, it fits both hands or feet and saves a trip to the salon!</li>
    <li> I was on the fence about purchasing the CND nail dryer versus this one.  I thought I&#x27;d try it and if I didn&#x27;t think it was as good as the CND nail dryer my salon uses I return it for the CND one.  I don&#x27;t mind paying for quality and as the old saying goes &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.  Well, I found it works just as good.  So glad I decided on it.  Its so easy to use and store.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This works exactly as needed.  I can even do all my toes at once.  The other UV light I had I could only do four fingers at a time and it took forever to do my manicure.</li>
    <li> Arrived with no light !!! Then when returned it does not give option to re-order !! Very disappointed indeed as was going to give it s agift and now it will  be late gift certainly hope it arrives with the darn light this time. !!</li>
    <li> My mom bought this and she like it...</li>
    <li> Best nail invest made! Great quality light. Has worked perfectly over a year and saved a bundled.</li>
    <li> This works as expected. A good price for a nice product.</li>
    <li> Actually, I guess the light works fine, but my nails are staying tacky, even after 9-12 minutes under the light.  The first time I thought I had applied the gels too thick, so the next time, I made sure to use very light coats, but nails were still tacky.  I love the idea of doing my nails at home, but not sure I would recommend this process</li>
    <li> i receive it in very good conditions</li>
    <li> it gets the job done and the wife is happy.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my daughter who was spending a lot on salon manicure and pedicures. She loves this and her nails look just as good as professionally done. Great price, great product!</li>
    <li> I chose this one after reading reviews and am glad i did.&lt;br /&gt;Less than 1/2 the price of the cnd light.&lt;br /&gt;Sets the shellac perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Both hands or feet fit!</li>
    <li> Forget paying $200+ for a UV lamp. I&#x27;ve used this for almost 2 years, and it&#x27;s still going strong. Save your money and buy this! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> So I added this to my cart after having it in my wish list, and was happy to see that it was: Price: $59.99 &amp; FREE Shipping.  Submitted my payment then realized that there was $15 in shipping charges for all of my items, including this one.  I changed my shipping method to Free shipping bcz I&#x27;m not in a hurry, and this item only had &amp;#34;Standard Shipping&amp;#34; as a shipping option, WHICH YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR.  Wish there was a way to flag this item as false.</li>
    <li> Bc the lights don&#x27;t always work, the bulbs are good but the machine doesn&#x27;t always keep the bulbs lit when required</li>
    <li> this is most definitely a professional quality lamp. For the same price as a battery operated, one handed lamp, this lamp is powered by an outlet and can fit 2 hands. It also comes with all the bulbs needed, so it really is ready to go right when it is delivered. The timers work easily with most gel and shellac polishes, or you could easily time yourself for LED polishes. It&#x27;s really not a big deal, since there is a continuous option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall efficient and a good deal.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much!  I love it!!! &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> I have been using sally hansen light and it sucked, i just finished my first set and it was sooo amazing!!! Got right to the point!!! Plus i paid for the two day delivery and it arrived the next day!!! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve gotten an LED vs a UV light. My husband threw away the box it came in otherwise I would return it. But I&#x27;ll have to make it work. The inside isn&#x27;t big enough to accommodate my hand even though it looks huge. The lower row of lights bumps my fingers.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a Christmas gift for a cosmotology student and she loves it. It is a very necessary item for those using the gel nail polishes since they requre a uv light to dry correctly and quickly. The size is perfect for getting both hands in to dry at the same time.</li>
    <li> The UV light heats up pretty fast and dries according to the time specified.</li>
    <li> My wife is tickled pink with this nail dryer.  It&#x27;s everything she expected and I rose a few levels in her opinion poll.  It functions as advertised, and makes her nails look very professional.  Now I wonder if the house work will suffer because of it ?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived on time, in good order and ready to use.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s in to that sort of thing.</li>
    <li> This has been great! I have saved a ton of money doing my own nails! This UV Gel light is exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> i was very leary to purchase this item.&lt;br /&gt;I must say my daughterr and I have been more than pleased with the ease of assembly and use of the unit.  We give it two thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Ms . Brown</li>
    <li> I was fed up with my nail polish chipping, over acrylics so tried UV polish...loved it - nail polish that stays shiny and does not chip off for at least 2 weeks - what was not so appealing was the fact that it cost $40 plus tip locally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing some research I decided to purchase the CND Shellac nail polish / base coat and top coat which require a UV lamp to set the colors. I paid $180 for all items - polish and lamp which is not bad, as by polish number 5 I will be saving my cash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CND has an official lamp with a rather high price tag, so I saw this, reviews looked good so decided to give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has three settings: 2 minutes, 3 minutes and constant. It also does come with the three bulbs it needs (be careful as they are tucked away in the box and I almost missed them!&lt;br /&gt;It is a good size - you can fit two hands or two feet in at the same time so it allows you to complete your UV process much faster! Similar lamps tend to be smaller - and more expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works perfectly for these UV polish systems and set my color just fine with no need for a repeat cure. Your nails will feel tacky at the end of the process, but simply follow directions, wipe your nails with an alcohol pad and you will be good to go - the lamp does the trick perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a UV lamp to use with UV polish systems, this is a great choice - good price, several settings, and large enough to cut time off your mani&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 4 years later this is still going strong, I have yet to replace a bulb  -I use myabe 20 or or times a year for reference, so based on the price and the fact this this has stood up well over time; it is a great pick!</li>
    <li> This lamp is about 18 inches by 10 inches and works well with CND Shellac.  You can easily put both hands in the lamp area and there is a plastic tray on the bottom that can be removed and cleaned.  I find the 3 and 2 min cycles are fine and \\&quot;cook\\&quot; my Shellac nails for a total of 5 min and then on to the next coat!  As another review mentioned, the lamps are included but they are tightly packed into the box and you must hunt for them.  I now use only CND Shellac for long term UV polish.  I tried OPI&#x27;s Axxium UV gel and it DESTROYED my nails.  Have used CND Shellac for months with no problems.  BTW, if you Shellac, you must rub nails with rubbing alcohol to get them to toughen up after you cure the final layer.  If you don&#x27;t use the rubbing alcohol, they nails are sticky.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for application of Shellac nail color. Many thanks to the previous reviewers comments on the perfomance of this product...it saved me well over $100. I used it today and it worked great...love the timer modes, easy to operate, easy to install bulbs. Remember to look for the bulbs in the bottom of the box as they are not installed in the unit for shipping. Nice to be able to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; both feet or hands at once...plenty roomy and more wattage than other more expensive lights.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have stated, I also used with the with Shellac nail products and it worked great!  Easy to put the bulbs and was ready to go!</li>
    <li> I waited two weeks for delivery only to have a defective unit on my hands that worked for 5 minutes then sparked, smoked and turned off.  I wanted a speedy exchange but was required to return it and wait up to 30 days for a refund (as this order was fulfilled by Amazon)... I am very frustrated... only more so since my polish was half dry when the malfunction started.</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed with this Thermal Spa Automatic Gel UV Light Nail Dryer.  It is un-usable!!  There were NO lights.  Electricity was present when plugged into an outlet but NO UV LIGHTS; therefore unable to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; the shellac nail polish.</li>
    <li> Great light...great price!</li>
    <li> THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THE  WHOLE NEW PROCESS OF THE NEW NAIL POLISH SYSTEM-SHELLAC  I GOT IT DONE 2 WEEKS AGO. IF THE MANICURIST HAD EXPLAINED THE PROCESS,ESPECIALLY THE REMOVAL, I WOULD NOT HAVE DONE IT AT ALL.     VERY EXPENSIVE, UNHEALTHY PROCESS.</li>
    <li> I received this UV light within 6 days and the quality was excellent for the price.  If you&#x27;re think about buying one to do your own nails (gel/shellac)don&#x27;t waste your money of CND light.  The Thermal Spa 49135 is a nice size for two hands at once or feet.</li>
    <li> I bought this light after reading all of the reviews on it. Despite the negative reviews that were a little scary to read, it is actually an awesome light. I used it right after opening it and the bulbs are super easy to snap in and everything! The light worked perfectly for my gel polish! I am using the Red Carpet Manicure LED polish with it. The only thing I worried about was the shipping since it took a while to actually ship but once it did, the item was here within two days. :)  Definitely look into this light, great buy for the price. Huge opening that fits your hands with room to spare. Very professional!</li>
    <li> I looked long and hard before I bought a light. I didnt have the couple hundred to spend on one but wanted some thing good! Well I found something GREAT! Does both hands. Well made. Spend the extra few bucks and buy this light. You wont be sorry!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this and used it last night for the first time.  The only assembly required is to plug in the bulbs (very easy).  I have had several shellac manicures but I ended up using the Gelish brand with the dryer.   It worked great - I followed the instructions for Gelish polish and my nails came out shiny and dry!  I had purchased a 15 watt mini UV lamp initially and that didn&#x27;t work for me at all. This lamp was a great price compared to some of the others out there and I am looking forward to not having to pay 35 dollars for a shellac manicure anymore.</li>
    <li> The Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer is a good value and solid investment for those looking to do their nails at home.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple times a week for the past month, doing my own and other&#x27;s nails with Gelish.  When I&#x27;m using darker colors I&#x27;ll use 2 cycles to make sure it has cured, but I think I&#x27;m just being overly careful.    I did have one time when the Gelish did not cure, but realized my daughter had put her hands close together and turned her nail so it was in a shadow.  As long as the nails are getting light directly or reflected they have cured nicely.  While I&#x27;d love to have an LED Dryer, for a fraction of the cost and just a bit more time this dryer works well.</li>
    <li> I received this curing light in the mail today and figured I&#x27;d give it a whirl.  I used the CND Shellac system to do an American manicure.  I had seen the manicure done several times but had never attempted it.  Shellac is relatively forgiving as long as you apply it thin.  I&#x27;m not stating this is the right or wrong way, but this is how I&#x27;ve seen it done most often. I did one hand start to finish and then the other for sake of ease and to prevent flaws.  1. Trimmed back cuticles, shaped the nails, and lightly buffed with a black buffing block just to remove shine.   2. Wash hands with soap and water, dry thoroughly.  Wipe each nail with a bit of paper towel soaked in 90% isopropyl alcohol (I cut a sheet of paper towel into a bunch of little squares.)  3. Shake shake shake that base coat bottle &#x27;til your arm hurts.   4. Apply a thin coat of base coat to the nails on one hand. Cure for 30 seconds.  5. After shaking and shaking, and shaking...apply Cream Puff thinly (just thick enough that it is opaque; this will probably take a little practice) to the nail tips (you can look on YouTube to get an idea of how to angle the brush).  6. Use a manicure brush dipped in 90% isopropyl alcohol and then blotted on paper towel to refine the line, coming from the knuckle side and making small circular touches to smooth the line into a nice curve.  7. Cure for 2 minutes. You can do minor touch ups with the Cream Puff and re-cure for 2 minutes.  8. Shake up the top coat. You can apply this just a tiny bit thicker than the other coats, but make sure to smooth it out nicely.  9. Cure for 6 minutes. Yes, 6 minutes.  10. Soak another bit of paper towel with 90% IPA, wipe down those nails until you remove the tacky layer.    11. Repeat on the other hand.  12. If you like, apply cuticle oil and lotion. It&#x27;s good to moisturize your nails after they&#x27;ve been exposed to so much alcohol.  13. Marvel in the fact that you accomplished something you normally pay $40-60 for someone else to do.  Like I said, I&#x27;m not a nail technician and I didn&#x27;t go to cosmetology school.  But I am pretty satisfied with the outcome.  This is a fantastic product so enjoy it.  Be patient and remember that practice makes perfect!</li>
    <li> i just received this and am having to return it.  after i plugged it in and turned it on, lights flashed at top like  it was supposed to but when i pushed button for time. light would not come on where the hand go in the unit</li>
    <li> This item i bought in sept. 2011 it is now jan. 2012 and i have to say i use it weekly the bulbs are still good. However they are getting low I am having trouble finding the bulbs for this thing even at the nail supply. Best suggestion go to walmart to buy the machine there. This one is real big and sometimes it gets dim, I mean it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The dryer worked perfectly the first three uses. On the fourth, one of the bulbs sparked and caused the lining to catch fire. No real harm done, but definitely scared the crap out of me since both my hands were inside at the time. In the returns process and hopefully the replacement isn&#x27;t defective.</li>
    <li> This product is great! No need to look elsewhere. It is large enough to put both hands in at the same time and that is so helpful for me. I love it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful.  I have had several lights for nails and paid alot of money for them and they did not work like this one does and the price is right! I am so pleased with this light.</li>
    <li> Bought this nail dryer to do shellac nails at home. It is large enough to fit both feet in and comes with 3 timer options (2 minutes, 3 minutes and continuous). Used it three times and nails come out perfect every time. Very pleased with the purchase!  P.S. I didn&#x27;t know that the base coat should still be tacky after the 10 seconds in the dryer so I thought the dryer wasn&#x27;t working correctly at first. Turned out it was the \\&quot;nail technician&#x27;s\\&quot; lack of knowledge.</li>
    <li> I just recieve it and im not  so happy  because the product its not new as they say it:( so unhappy.</li>
    <li> GET AN LED ONE, IT ACTUALLY DRIES THE PAINT</li>
    <li> My gal still loves this thing and uses it all the time for herself and some of her family.</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases I have ever made!</li>
    <li> Very prompt delivery.  Was packed well.  It is larger than I imagined which is just fine.  I can put both hands in at the same time.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I am sure it will do just fine.  Good value, I think.</li>
    <li> It really does a great job and works well with almost all the gel polishes. I&#x27;ve tried several of them and it works the same for all.</li>
    <li> its a nice size and a nice value compared to the many options out there. my girlfriend has one and recommended it to me.</li>
    <li> The machine works really well, nail polish stays on without chipping for 2 weeks, its quick and light, easy to use and set up.</li>
    <li> I started doing my own gel/shellac nails and this paid for itself in just a couple of uses.  I&#x27;ve had this for over a year and it continues to function excellently.</li>
    <li> Terrible, after several seconds of work it exploded, putting my health under risk. Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> This light is worth every penny. I bought it over a year ago when I was tired of paying the salon $30 to do my gel manicures. I haven&#x27;t had to replace a bulb yet. It works and cures the gel nails the same as the salon. This is so worth it!</li>
    <li> Love my light!  Shellac-ing up a storm at home while watching TV!!  Even doing my own french manicures!!  Gotta love You-tube!</li>
    <li> With the exception of figuring out how to get the nail color to cover to the tips, this light with the CND shellac worked perfectly with my first time using it.  I thought at first that the lights did not work but they had to be pushed in far enough and then all 3 lit up.  Definitely recommend; even if you only have your nails done 2 or 3 times a year, it will pay for itself.</li>
    <li> It work well but I have to keep pushing in two bulbs they are not fitting tight.</li>
    <li> It doesnt dry my nail polish to a hard coat. Oh well</li>
    <li> When it&#x27;s working it is great. I really like the timer buttons and the large inside space - can put both hands in at one time. The bulbs get too hot and then the lights will shut off and not come back on until it has cooled off. Very frustrating when you&#x27;re doing gel nail polish. Sometimes I could jiggle it and get it to come back on. Put in new bulbs and problem persisted.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife, she borrowed one that was smaller from a friend and got hooked.  Got her this one, was not sure how big it was but when we got it you can do both hands at the same time.  Working well so far.</li>
    <li> I got all my shellac products and buffed my nails, all ready to do my nails and use my new light.  But when I went to set it up I couldn&#x27;t find the bulbs!  My husband finally found them for me cleverly concealed in the bottom of the box.  I have used this several times, and have only this one caution about the shellac concept in general.  Take care removing the polish.  file the polish to rough the surface, then soak cotton balls in pure acetone, put them on your nails and wrap them in aluminum foil.  Wait.  Someone told me you can put them under the light and it helps but I haven&#x27;t tried that.  There are now many more color options available to buy.  I also do designs on my nails, I use art acrylics right before the top coat. (BTW, I&#x27;m Susie, Robert is my husband and he wants me to assure that that he doesn&#x27;t do his nails)</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, I ordered it and was so excited when it came. When I plugged it in, it didn&#x27;t work so I&#x27;m returning it. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just a lemon! I just reordered so hoping the next one works!!</li>
    <li> works awesome as long as you follow the CND directions. only complaint is lightbulbs are a little hard to lock into place. otherwise i&#x27;m totally happy.</li>
    <li> This item arrived on time and securely packaged. The bulbs were easy to install. The entire unit is lightweight and easy to store when not in use. The bulbs do not get hot; therefore, the unit can be stored immediately after use. Note that medical experts recommend using SPF 30 or higher sunscreen on your hands before using the dryer to protect your skin from th UV rays (just make sure to use an alcohol swab to remove any of the sunscreen from the bed of the nail before applying the gel).</li>
    <li> Got this to work with my new shellac polish and I was hesitant at first but it works great! Love the time settings, 2 min, 3 min and continuous! It makes it do mindless :)</li>
    <li> I got this to start doing the Gelish manicure at home. Going to a salon can be costly and this baby has already paid for itself! I don&#x27;t know how long the bulbs last, but I looked and replacing the bulbs aren&#x27;t too expensive. When I have to replace the bulbs I&#x27;ll update the review and let everyone know... You won&#x27;t regret this purchase!!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS LAMP!! ENOUGH ROOM AND BULBS FOR BOTH HANDS. WORKS PERFECT AND THE PRICE WAS GREAT!!&lt;br /&gt;RECEIVED VERY QUICKLY.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought. Thought I ordered single hand.  The lights go off constantly . It&#x27;s OK for personal use. Would not recommend. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to order  the Thermal Spa 49135.  I ordered through Prime so I would receive it in two days.  It wad ordered on 4/23 to arrive by 4/25.  It is now 4/26 and the item has not shipped.  Amazon should not have a charge to join Prime if they have no intention of giving timely service.  I wish I was giving myself and my daughter manicures, but I guess that will have to wait...[[ASIN:B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 7/3/12 - I should have written this a while ago... I cancelled the nail dryer from the original supplier and reordered.  The second supplier delivered within two days.  My daughter and I absolutely love this dryer.  You can put your whole hand in at once, which makes the process of applying gel polish much quicker.  We have saved a fortune doing our gel manicures at home.  A wonderful investment.</li>
    <li> I ordered this particular lamp after a couple of my friends ordered it.  They were so pleased with it and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get the lamp to do my own gel nails.  The U/V Light nail dryer arrived quickly, but there were NO LED BULBS included!  This was not expected and each bulb is approximately $12 to purchase individually- ridiculous.  Both of my friends&#x27; lamps had the bulbs included and I am very frustrated.  Hopefully, the seller USA Enterprises LLC will quickly make things right for me.[[ASIN:B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer]]</li>
    <li> This machine really works good, but after a couple minutes it kinda burns. I used it for my OPI gel and due to it being a UV the curing time takes longer, so consequently it gets hotter. Also you have to be careful putting your hands in, because they can hit the back lower bulb. It does work and for the price you might want to deal with the heat.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the money.  However, the product description is not accurate.  The unit is plastic and not made of \\&quot;heavy duty steel construction\\&quot; as stated by the seller.</li>
    <li> I think the lamp is very pretty and large enough for two hands, and I also see that most people here love it.  I must be doing something wrong because I leave my nails under the lamp for much, much longer than required.  I can leave them in there for ten minutes each and the nails simply refuse to dry.  I follow all of the steps and have watched several videos on exactly how the entire process is done, and purchased everything to go with the system.  After waiting and waiting for my nails to dry under this lamp and nothing happening, the ONLY thing that dries my nails is the ALCOHOL that I rub on them towards the last step.  I must be doing something wrong.  I am not using a lot of polish either......just a thin coat for each layer.  I&#x27;m confused.  If someone can shed some light, that would be great, too.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is a great nail uv light.  Works for hands and feet. Use this item with gelish set. Works great. Like the three settings - 2 minutes, 3 minutes, or continuous.</li>
    <li> Works for CND shellac!</li>
    <li> An absolute must for shellac and gel nails.</li>
    <li> I love it! Works great! Great quality for the price! It&#x27;s big! And spacious for two hands.</li>
    <li> I foloowed the instructions that other reviewers posted and it worked great with CND shellac!  Definitely would recommend for those who want to save money on the bi-weekly manicure!  Super-fast shipping too - ordered on Wednesday, standard shipping, here on Friday!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on its reviews and I am very satisfied. I wear nail gel for 10-14 days and I do them myself which saves me time and money.</li>
    <li> This light worked well the first time I used it.....But the second time I did manicures on two people.  During the first one, the light went off several times, but came back on.  By the time I started the second person, the light continued to go off....Then finally didn&#x27;t work at all......Returned it!!</li>
    <li> I checked the prices for some UV nail dryers at a beauty supply store, and this one had the best price by far.  The ones that I looked at were almost the same price, but were made for only one hand.  This one easily fits both hands or feet with room to spread your fingers.  It has 3 sets of UV bulbs and 3 timed settings, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, or always on.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased the top and base coats with the dryer and I am extremely satisfied with everything.  For some of the people that wrote bad reviews, I&#x27;d like to tell them that I thought the dryer wasn&#x27;t working right either until I realized that the sticky residue was why I thought that. Make sure you use plenty of cleaner and your nails will have a beautiful shine. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried anything like this and it is great. Works well and I am able to my own nails</li>
    <li> I bought this light and have used it once with CNC shellac. I am enjoying the product so far!&lt;br /&gt;Some issues I had when I first received it:&lt;br /&gt;1. I thought I had not received the bulbs. However, the bulbs are packed separately in the bottom of the box and are easy to miss.&lt;br /&gt;2. I was worried I might be having the same trouble getting the bulbs to work mentioned by other reviewers. However, when I pushed the \\&quot;nonworking\\&quot; bulb in until it clicked,  it worked fine!&lt;br /&gt;3. I&#x27;m new to shellac, so the \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; surface after curing caused me think that maybe the light hadn&#x27;t worked. I learned that this is normal and all you need to do is wipe the nail with 91% (or higher) alcohol when you are finished and the surface is no longer \\&quot;tacky\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I used this lamp to cure my OPI Gel polish &amp; it worked fantastically!! Simply follow the directions &amp; you have a chip-free manicure for a fraction of the price of getting your nails done at the salon!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this lamp!!</li>
    <li> I received this product today, which was fast and that was something that i didn&#x27;t expect. Another thing that I didn&#x27;t expect were the bulbs that was included didn&#x27;t work at all or gave off very little light. Please explain to me how is this &amp;#34;Thermal Spa&amp;#34; suppose to dry my nails as good as the salon or for that matter give me my monies worth…seriously, I need an answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, I need to return this item or someone needs to send me some replacement bulbs. I would like to believe that it is the bulbs and not the &amp;#34;Thermal Spa&amp;#34; unit. I really wanted to do my nails this weekend and get ready for the spring/summer weather…oh I do like the fact that I can fit both hands into the unit, which should speed up the drying process, but not with this bulbs that are out….Please help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did anyone else have this problem when they received their unit?</li>
    <li> I have used it with regular nail polish not gel and the polish lasted two weeks no problems it&#x27;s great. Can dry both hands at once.</li>
    <li> I bought this U/V Gel Light more than two months ago to use for Shellac or OPI shellac type manicures that have to cure under such a light.  I noticed a handful of reviews where people said no matter how long they leave their nails under the light, it never dries their nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to follow directions completely, especially at the end where you finish the process by rubbing the nails with alcohol.  That sets everything.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any part of the process.  It&#x27;s important to prepare your nails well before applying the base coat and polish.  It&#x27;s worth extra time to make sure that part is done right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other suggestion is to either buy some gloves designed for wearing under the light (finger tips cut out) or make some.  These lights can increase the risk of melanoma.  I wear gloves and keep my hands under the light exactly as long as it says is necessary and no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is spa perfect nails much, much cheaper.  I&#x27;m ahead of the game financially already and never have to wait out chipped nails until I can get to the spa.  The manicures last so long, I always end up re-doing them because of the nails growing out, not because anything went wrong with the manicure.  Bottom line:  the light works great and it&#x27;s really nice being able to put both hands in there at once, a time saver.</li>
    <li> This UV light is awesome! You can easily fit both hands (and feet if you&#x27;re painting your toes!)&lt;br /&gt;There are three settings on it as well! It&#x27;s perfect:)</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous ordering this light as I read some of the negative comments others made. However, the professional UV light was way out of my price range so I ordered this one. I am so happy with the purchase! Thank goodness I did not listen to the negative comments. The light did come with the bulbs. I was a little scared to put them in as I was unsure of how hard I had to press to put them in. I did plug it in a couple times and it did not turn on, but that is because I did not press the lights in properly.&lt;br /&gt;Once I got them in it was smooth sailing. I use it bi-weekly on myself and my family and friends. No problems what so ever. Now I am saving so much money doing no chip manicures myself. For anyone wondering I use the gellish brand in the no chip and it is amazing.</li>
    <li> If you are ordering this item for a shellac nail product, don&#x27;t waste your money. IT DOES NOT WORK !! I ran my nails through like eight continuous sessions with this product, and my nails were still as wet as they were before I started. I&#x27;m returning mine to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this so that I could do my own gel polish manicures at home.  I use Gelish products and it worked beautifully!  I was anxious the first couple times I used it because of some of the reviews that I read when I was choosing which light to buy, but I could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;The price is fantastic and the size of accommodates 2 hands or 2 feet!! What a huge difference when I can paint and dry both hands at one time. (Gel polish layers do not dry until cured)&lt;br /&gt;For anyone that is reviewing ad saying that their nails weren&#x27;t \\&quot;dry\\&quot; at the end...it is a USER error.  All brands of gel polish will be tacky (sticky, wet, dull) until they are rubbed with alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;There are some great videos on YouTube that offer tutoring and troubleshooting advice.&lt;br /&gt;Gelish makes a mini-kit they stock at Sally&#x27;s and it comes with a DVD to assist in the application, as well as nice printed photo instructions.&lt;br /&gt;The other thought I had too about those \\&quot;tacky polish at the end\\&quot; reviews was... BE SURE YOU ARE USING A GEL POLISH SYSTEM!  The light, this one or a $300 one, is NOT going to cure (harden) regular polish...EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this again and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a budget friendly, 2 hand/foot light.  Save ton$ of $$$ by doing it yourself!</li>
    <li> My nails start chipping in two days after doing at home; professional manicures give me an extra day or two; hardly worth the price. I was skeptical of this little machine. Right now I am using up my regular variety of polishes from OPI to Wet &amp; Wild.  It is AMAZING how long the manicure lasted and how shiny my nails are. Even though your nails are dry to touch, it does take a little longer to totally firm up so I would advise not doing much for a while to avoid those fine scratch lines.  I did purchase a gel cleanser to remove the tacky feeling. I had no problems inserting the bulbs and the machine arrived in a timely, perfect condition.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic for at home use in creating a gel manicure.  I usually go to the salon and get a shellac manicure.  In NY the ladies never seem to paint on the gel thick enough so I go home after and put an extra coat of the top coat gel on and dry it in this dryer. This dryer is actually nicer than any I have seen in most of the salons I go to.  This can fit two hands or two feet at once, although I only do one hand at a time.  Great value for the money.  Makes my thinly applied shellac manicure last and last.</li>
    <li> I researched extensively, as I always do with all products I buy, many UV gel light nail dryers. I had learned how to do my own gel nails at home but needed the UV gel light nail dryer to set the nail products properly. My first advice is that at-home gel nails require a good knowledge of the correct and successful products and methods to do them; many reviews I have seen on this product on this site reflect an obvious lack of knowledge about the tedious steps and specific products involved and an unreasonable expectation that the UV gel light nail dryer will work on an improperly prepared process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good product. I like it after a few months of use. It arrived well packaged, with easy instructions and included the bulbs - which were very easy to install. The dryer is lightweight and compact, yet wide enough to do two hands at a time - and my hands are not small. The timer allows three options, with the 3 minute being the one I use most. If that is too long, I just click the off button. Some reviews were negative on the quality but I see no problem at all, however, there are delicate bulbs so one must be gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews said the product did not cure their nails. Again, I suspect poor nail preparation; perhaps they did not use a final alcohol swipe to remove the usual sticky surface that the alcohol will remove, setting the gel. Some reviews say it&#x27;s too hot, which it has to be if the nails are to set properly close to the bulbs. If my hands get too warm, I just stop the dryer for a minute then restart the product; each person has a different tolerance for  strong and close UV light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I give the product a top rating in all categories.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product, but when I plugged it in and did not work I was very disappointed.  The light on the top just kept flashing, the UV light did not come on at all,  I tried several times but still did not work.  I sent it right back.</li>
    <li> Live how u can do both hands or feet. A bit short so b careful that u don&#x27;t put your hands to far back or u will ruin your polish.</li>
    <li> Did not dry the nail polish. It left my nail polished bunched up (polish was not smooth) and \\&quot;tacky\\&quot;.  Plan to try dryer with different brand of gel polish.</li>
    <li> I read a few other reviews where the bulbs would flicker or not turn on.  Other users said they had to jiggle them a bit to get them to start.  This is true, as I am having the same problem.  I have used this 5-6 times, and each time I have to wiggle one bulb or another.  With that being said, once they are all on, it seems to work just fine.  I get the same results as the lights in the salon.  I think the price can&#x27;t be beat.  My mom can buy at the beauty supply wholesale stores and their lamps are all $200 - $400.  This one does the same thing for a fraction of the cost.  I have been using the Gelish System with this lamp and it&#x27;s been fine.  I did just use a CND Shellac color this last time.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a better product, or I&#x27;m just getting better at application, but this manicure seems to be the best.  I am going to try another CND Shellac color.  I&#x27;ve have learned the hard way -- there are few tips I wish someone would have shared with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. When removing nail polish, soak part of a cotton ball in acetone.  Place directly on nail and wrap with foil.  Sit for about 10 minutes.  It makes removal SO much easier.  And it&#x27;s better for your hands because not so much is exposed to pure acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. When you start put all the cotton balls away.  Don&#x27;t have any cotton balls near year.  The first few times, bits of cotton got into the color and top coats and then the manicure looks like a total \\&quot;at home\\&quot; job.  Trust me, it will find it&#x27;s way.  I clean my nails with a nail brush just prior to starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the prep wipes.  It&#x27;s just alcohol.  After filing, shaping and cuticle trimming.  Wash hands. Dry with towel and apply a swipe of acetone or alcohol to nail bed. Let dry and begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Use VERY THIN coats on all steps.  Once it gets \\&quot;gloopy\\&quot; you might as well start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  The process is no where near as \\&quot;forgiving\\&quot; as traditional nail polish.  Once it&#x27;s cured - it&#x27;s cured.  So, if you go off your nail a bit, fix it before it goes under the light.  If part of it goes over to your skin it won&#x27;t seal properly and it will just pop off in a day or two.  Esp true with the top coat.  A little goes a long way and good luck keeping it \\&quot;in the lines.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. You have to get good cuticle nippers and a good cuticle remover gel.  Take your time on this step (remember, not as forgiving as traditional nail polish).  If you have cuticles, you will get paint on them - it won&#x27;t seal and in two days you won&#x27;t be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.  You can use the 70% rubbing alcohol to cure it, however, if you can find 91% or higher it&#x27;s worth the extra $1.00.  I found some at wal-mart.  Soak the cotton  and don&#x27;t be afraid to rub the nail.  It won&#x27;t ruin it and it will cure it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Don&#x27;t buy this lamp!  It has been a little over a month and about 6 uses...when I turned it on tonight, it flickered and wouldn&#x27;t turn on. Completely dead.  I was worried because it was outside the 30 day window.  I called Amazon and becuase it was fullfilled by them they are standing by their products and refunding me my money.  THANK YOU AMAZON FOR BEING A COMPANY THAT I CAN TRUST AND WHICH VALUES THEIR CUSTOMERS.  Whew! I could have been out $60.00!</li>
    <li> What a joke. Leaves CND Shellac tacky and doesn&#x27;t set properly. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It does not work to dry the nail shellac no matter how long I set the timer for! Would love to return it....</li>
    <li> I purchased this nail dryer for use with CND shellac I purchased separately.  After I installed the three bulbs - found in the packaging beneath the unit, I followed the directions of the base coat (10 seconds in dryer), color polish (coat 1, two mins in dryer, coat 2, two mins in dryer), top coat (two mins in dryer), then used rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball to remove tacky layer off mynails.  My nails turned out PERFECTLY!!!  The dryer is large enough for two hands or feet to be in there together, but we just did one appendage at a time to get the hang of it the first go round.  I would highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking to do your own shellac nails at home - it is sooooooo worth it!</li>
    <li> Works great.  But if you honestly think you can shellac your own nails correctly not being a professional. Your crazy.</li>
    <li> No bulbs were received with the dryer, making it useless.  I wrote back and asked about the lights and all I got back was a canned email saying they hope I liked the product.  They never addressed my issues and in the meantime I lost the small piece of paper that told about ordering replacement bulbs.  I didn&#x27;t get any to replace and don&#x27;t know exactly which ones to order since the company has not bothered to contact me personally addressing my issues.</li>
    <li> If you are considering buying this but worried it won&#x27;t perform well, don&#x27;t! Save yourself the money and get this light instead of the brand one because this works just fine. I cure CND Shellac weekly doing my nails and my friends and I have had zero issues. Easy to install lights, easy to use. I cure base 2 min, each layer of polish (2) 2 min, and then my top coat 3 min. Go ahead and buy it!</li>
    <li> Work perfect for my CND shellac nails! I like the timer setting, so easy to use! The product arrived on schudule</li>
    <li> When I realized I could pay to do my own gel nails vs. 3 trips to the salon, I began the search.  Based on other reviews, I chose the Thermal Spa 49135 Professional Gel Dryer and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I like being able to put both hands in at the same time (haven&#x27;t tried a pedi yet), and the result is just like the salon.  When I did my own nails before, the polish would start to chip in the first day or two.  I also had acrylic nails for years, because my own nails would break.  Wish you could see my nails now with the gel procedure.  They are long, strong and shiny for at least 10 days.  What a time saver!</li>
    <li> My clients also like this and they said their hands even don&#x27;t get hot when they are inside the machine.</li>
    <li> ...and it works great.  It is big to handle 2 sets of fingers at a time, and even 2 sets of toes if they are not too wide!  It has a 2 minute timer, a 3 minute timer, and a continuous.  I bought it for just under $50.00, when most lights - the small ones - cost over $100.00.  Yes, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t figure out how to get the dang bulbs in!!! It came with replacement bulbs only.  Not completely set up.  Very frustrating!</li>
    <li> It works fine but not deep enough when</li>
    <li> This works perfectly for the at-home Shellac manicures!!  It seems a little cheaply made but is just fine for my own personal use! :o)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had CND Shellac done several times at the salon, but it&#x27;s just too expensive to do a regular basis.  So when I saw this item online I thought maybe it might just work at home.      Last night I did my first manicure at home, and it was a huge success!  I am thrilled with the results.  This product worked perfectly.  Here&#x27;s what I love about it...  - Easy to install the bulbs  - You can detach the power cord from the unit for better storage  - Tons of room so you can do both hands at the same time  - Very easy to use  - Very light and easy to carry.  - There are little non-slip pads on the bottom to keep it from moving around on a hard surface.      Plus I was happy to see there is a one year warranty on the product as well.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting that.      The manicure looks just like I had it done at the salon, so I am thrilled!  I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like that it is large enough for two hands but that&#x27;s about it.  It does take a lot longer to cure.  I have only used mine a few times and when I first took it out of the box, I had problems getting it to come on.  I falsely assumed that I had the lamps in incorrectly.  After I reinstalled those, miraclously the unit came on.  The third time I tried to use it, same problem. After toggling the on/off switch repeatedly, the unit responded and I resolved to leave it on and simply unplug it, assuming there was a \\&quot;short\\&quot; in the on/off circuit. This worked for several times but last night I was all set up to use it, and couldn&#x27;t get it to come on.  After 10 minutes of playing with it, it finally responded. In addition the lamps do not wrap around the sides like the CND. Should have saved my box and sent it back but as it stands now I have an unreliable lamp, that very possibly won&#x27;t work at all when I try it next time and will end up in the trash after 6 or 7 uses.  Very cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Got this with CND shellac nail products. Works just like salon UV driers, and half the cost of CND brand drier. Works perfect, same with bulbs and replacement bulb information, warranty, etc. Has 2 minute, 3 minute, and continuous time settings.</li>
    <li> I prefer to do my own nails and save the salon cost.  Buying this from Amazon saved almost half the normal price.</li>
    <li> I hate wasting time waiting on my nails to dry. So after going to the salon for my first 2 sets of Gelish or Shellac manicures, I decided to try it myself. Salon had the \\&quot;one hand at a time\\&quot; machines. So when I found this one on Amazon that lets you do BOTH HANDS AT THE SAME TIME, I thought WOW...that&#x27;s cool. I&#x27;ve used the product 3 times and it&#x27;s great. Has a timer, and good strong bulbs. Makes doing your own gel manicures at home a cinch! The only thing I miss is a 1 minute timer. The timer has 2 minute, 3 minute and continuous setting. Shellac and Gelish instructions call for you to dry the base coat for 1 minute, but drying it for 2 doesn&#x27;t seem to negatively effect the process, so that&#x27;s what I do.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to be used with my resin art, very pleased with the opening size, make it easy to slide my projects in without spilling a drop ! Def glad I bought this one !</li>
    <li> The bulbs are a pain to put in and they keep going out. I have taken them out and put back in a dozen times and cannot get all three lights on at the same time.</li>
    <li> This thermal spa works great with the CND Shellac nail polishes. I especially like that I can put all 10 fingers in at one time, if I choose to. I do this for the undercoat and top coat, but do just one hand at a time for the color coats.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lamp for my own personal use to do gelish manicures.  I works out just fine for curing both hands at the same time. The only improvement would be for a built in hood covering the bulbs from view because the opening is rather large.  I drape a facial towel over the opening to shield my eyes from the uv bulbs.  Also recommend wearing fingerless gloves or sunscreen while curing nails to protect against uv radiation exposure. Great price for this lamp, about half the cost that I would have paid with my professional license from beauty supply dealers!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my sister who is a nail tech and works part time in her home.  I was very disappointed when it came with no light which was not noted in the description.  Please advise where the light bulb can be purchased as I would like to give her the full product for XMAS</li>
    <li> Has worked well for my home shellac manicures.  The space is fine for fingers and toes.  Saved a lot of money doing my manicures at home!</li>
    <li> This product is light weight, easy to handle and terrific to use for a professional look. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I bought this to do my own nails using Shellac.  I love it!  I am only curious about one thing.  When you flip the switch to on, the lights automatically turn on, is there a way to shut lights off without flipping the switch to off?  If not, that sure would be nice!  Please let me know if you noticed the same thing.  Otherwise ABOSLUTELY no complaints!</li>
    <li> This nail dyer does what it says it&#x27;ll do. However, you can&#x27;t comfortably fit both of your hands in. The width of the dryer is very short and the there is a set of UV bulbs right in the back. My clients would always hit the tips of their fingers on the hot bulbs - Ouch! Returned a week later with no problems.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with CND shellac. After 5 manicures and1 pedicure I have no complaints. This product dries the polish as it should. It is a large dryer to store and I only use it for one hand/foot at a time so a smaller version would have been nice but for the price it was the best value I found after months of research.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before I purchased this and they helped me a lot.  I have had my U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer for several months and I am so glad that I ordered this one.  It does the job well!  I&#x27;m also very pleased I did NOT order a smaller one that only does 4 fingers! What a waste of time!!  This one does both hands at the same time and also does both feet at the same time.  It has a timer for 2 minutes, 3 minutes and continuous timing.  It is built well and does an excellent job drying my nails (gel or regular polish).  I have saved so much money owning this and doing my own Gel Nails!!  My only complaint is, I wish they had developed this systems 20 years ago!  My polish will last 2 to 3 weeks.  Thank you so much Thermal Spa and Amazon!</li>
    <li> Just love it !!!  so fast and wonderful  It so profesional and easy...  two hands at a time.... saves 1/2 the time..!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived super fast but I haven&#x27;t used it yet. I hope it works great but only time I&#x27;ll tell. Will up date soon</li>
    <li> There were so many positive reviews, that I didn&#x27;t hesitate to order this product and was very excited to try an at-home gel manicure. Unfortuntely, the product did not work at all for me; just like many of the 1-star reviews. The operation light on top worked, blinking waiting for me to select the 2 min, 3 min, or continuos timer lights. The problem was that none of the lightbulbs would turn on. It was frustrating to get no instructions (the instructions that came with the unit had nothing about installing the bulbs, operating, etc.). So, I read the other reviews and removed the bulbs and reseated them, ensuring they clicked in like some of the reviewers had suggested ... nothing. I don&#x27;t know about these bulbs, but when I shook them gently, I heard debris of some kind moving around in each of the bulbs, making me think that maybe they were all damaged in shipping. I really don&#x27;t know. Very disappointed in this product. I hope the return process goes well ... my first return w/Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  I love that its got a larger opening.  Plus it was shipped  to me quickly and packaged well.</li>
    <li> This light relly is nice.  It&#x27;s much better than I&#x27;d expected.  It cures my nails fast and has plenty of room to accomidate both hands or toes at once.  A great price for this product!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product for several months before making my purchase. I was like a kid at Christmas when it arrived, I was so excited to be able to do my own nails and confident that I would have the same great results as the other people whose reviews I had read concerning this nail dryer.  I was WRONG!!!  I had all of my manicure/pedicure essentials out, ready to go and I took the dryer out of the box, put in the bulbs, turned on the power and Nothing, Nada, Zilch. The lights on top came on but the bulbs did not.  I flipped them, switched them, Googled how to make it work, tried to contact customer service for Thermal Spa all to no avail.  I was resigned to send it back for a refund. Honestly, I think it had to do with the way it was packaged and shipped.  The box it was shipped in was quite a bit larger than the actual box the dryer came in and it might have been rough-handled during shipping.  There was space on either side of the actual Thermal Spa dryer box without any packing materials around it to keep it from moving so that may be the reason for the defect.  Now I guess my search begins again to try to find a dryer that will actually work and not be a $55.00 shiny object to just look at.</li>
    <li> If I could rate this a zero star I would.  I purchased this because of the many other positive reveiws, the discount in price from $149. down $52.  I thought it might be on clearance or something. If someone could see this in person, there is no way it once sold for $149. It is extremely cheap and very light weight.  I trusted the majority other reviews saying how great this product was.  When I got this product through my Prime Amazon account I was sooo excited until I opened the box, plugged the lights in, and vola the lights came on for about 3 seconds and then nothing. Then, pushed the bulbs in much harder, they were all the way in. Lights would flicker on when I would jiggle the plug in the back.  Prop the plug, in the back, up with a book and another flicker.  It came on again for a few more seconds and then nothing again.  Turned it upside down, light flickered and then nothing again.  What a disappointment. I trusted these other reviews, as I normally do on Amazon, but something is really wrong with these reviews.  Obviously sent it back.  Wow, what a bummer.  Because I trusted the reviews so much, thought it was my obligation to write this honest review.</li>
    <li> Doing your own gel nails is difficult, but this is a great UV light for it. It is great to be able to stick both hands or feet in at once - it saves so much time!</li>
    <li> Works great... IF IT WORKS! I just got this light yesterday. It shorted out and quit working half way through. On the hand that it worked on it worked great... going to have to replace it and haven&#x27;t had it for 24hours yet!!! :-(</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research to get the best bang for my buck, and this lamp is just that! It was delivered quick. It&#x27;s very easy to assemble. Some reviews I read said that the timer was on the back but it&#x27;s on top! I love it! I just got done doing 6 gelish manis and they all turned out fabulous!</li>
    <li> Granted I have only used it once, but it did exactly as it was supposed to. I would like to say how I really feel. Wow! Wow! Wow!  The product came so quick.  I opened it up and immediately used it with CND Shellac products which I also purchased at the same time.  My nails were done in less than 5 minutes from start to finish. I only used the bottom &amp; top coats.  The curing time was only 30 secs to 1 minute for each step.  The UV lamp was awesome.  Planning on buying this for my daughter &amp; son&#x27;s girlfriend for Christmas.  The lamp will be awesome whether used with gel, shellac or normal polish!  It looks identical to the one they use at my nail salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some others had said that the lamp didn&#x27;t come with the bulbs.  My three 18 watt bulbs were located on the bottom of the box under a cardboard cover.  The instructions didn&#x27;t tell you how to put the bulbs in, but they were very easy to figure out.  I double checked to make sure the bulbs were in all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had my nails done once with the shellac at a salon. So I wasn&#x27;t real sure I could do this.  But I also knew paying $25-35 for the manicure plus tip every 10-14 days would really add up.  I paid $53 for UV lamp and $30 for bottom &amp; top coat CND and $13 for fresh scrub. Even after just one use, I can tell the products will last a long time.  I hope the shellac comes off easy with the acetone. Because if it does, I would love to order some CND color.  The lamp was so awesome and took so very little time,  Very excited to see my daughter&#x27;s face when she gets hers.  Love love love this product!!</li>
    <li> At first I thought one of the light bulb sockets didn&#x27;t work and then I realized that the light bulbs weren&#x27;t pushed in all the way.  you have to put both hands on either side of the bulb and plug in and push together.  then you will hear it click into place.  before they were too wobbly and looked like they shorted out.  so make sure you get it in all the way.  I bought the cheaper $30 UV light before this and sent it back because it was pretty cheaply made and one of the sockets didn&#x27;t work when the light bulb was plugged in all the way.  It was only big enough for one hand but it was still a tight squeeze to get your hand in.  I LOVE the thermal spa.  It looks really nice, has the great timer, and is roomy.  It is definitely worth the extra cash!</li>
    <li> I love this uv light. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and it&#x27;s still going strong. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about buying this product because I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money on something if it didn&#x27;t work. It came in very quickly, and everything was carefully wrapped and protected in a box. It works great, and I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time last week.  How nice to do your nails and not have to wait hours to do things.  Wish I bought it sooner.</li>
    <li> Very easy use and works great.  Definitely a good product.  Was as depicted in the description and picture and not over priced.  Would recommend to anyone.  The only drawback was that it is 45 watts and the first bottle of UV topcoat I purchased required 60 - 75 watts, but that was my mistake in not purchasing the correct wattage top coat.  Worked wonderfully once I purchased the correct product.</li>
    <li> This is bigger than I thought but you can put both Hands in at the same time!  It did take me awhile to get the lights installed securely</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to install lights. Great price! Professional quality. It is nice being able to do both hands at once.</li>
    <li> Ordered this so I could save some money and do my own home gel color. Especially since my nail slim does nt apply gel polish to the toes. It does not dissapoint I can even put two hands or feet in at he same time..talk about time and money saving b</li>
    <li> Great light.  Can do both hands.  I&#x27;m so glad I read the reviews on Amazon or I would never have known to be careful about NOT touching the lights when putting them in (and also when using the light).  Also, I think they might have changed the packaging, because I don&#x27;t think I would have accidentally thrown away the light bulbs, but was VERY glad for the warning I read on another review.&lt;br /&gt;The price of $49.95 made this very reasonable and made me willing to try it out.  I would not have bought it for the higher price, since lights like this are now available everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s awfully big and bulky and kind of a pain to store, but oh well, what can you do about that?  It&#x27;s big for the convenience.&lt;br /&gt;I can get both hands done in</li>
    <li> I was using a small lamp I bought at my local beauty store for my gelish nails and they were always chipping and lifting and literally wiping off when I would finish them.  Once I bought this lamp, it never happened again.  My gelish stays on 2-3 weeks!  amazing.  This lamp does get hot so I would recommend the uv gloves to keep your hands beautiful and tan free.  Also, my old light, only 4 nails at a time, this one, both hands!  Whoot!  I&#x27;m a happy girl!</li>
    <li> Im a busy mom with two kids, work a full time job and just don&#x27;t really have the extra cash or time every other week to go to the salon to get my nails done so I did some research and learned how to do Gel Nails by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I had to find a light that would properly cure the product I planned to use (OPI Gel) I read a ton of the reviews on this product and contemplated for weeks before I decided to just go ahead and spend the sixty bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my first gel manicure tonight and I have to say I was very impressed with the light it shipped decently fast, I was able to plug my bulbs right in without a hassle. The light cured my nails perfect I used the 3 minute timer for each coat. Defenatly would not hesatate to purchase this light it does the job for a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, Works great</li>
    <li> this is the nail light to get!  love it!  so easy to use, only one button to push.  three settings which is nice for doing different jobs</li>
    <li> Novice DIY gel manicure at home..... so glad that I chose the professional quality light!&lt;br /&gt;Use rubbing alcohol on nails after curing to remove tackiness....A&lt;br /&gt;hint i gleaned from a salon!</li>
    <li> I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS ITEM CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO USE IT, IT IS VERY PROFFESIONAL IN FACT IT IS MORE THAN I EXPECTED</li>
    <li> I use this up to twice a month WITH the protective gloves, and it works just great! In fact, it is the same brand and style they had at the salon I USED to get my gel polish manicures done ;) ..It was a decent price and the quality so far, is great. I recommend..</li>
    <li> This is a good dryer for the price. The dryer takes a little longer to dry than I was hoping.</li>
    <li> I ended up returning the light. It didn&#x27;t cure like I thought it would and was too big a unit. Ended up buying a LED small one-hand unit for Gelish polish.</li>
    <li> I decided to try doing my own shellac mani-pedis and I&#x27;m so glad I did! This unit is double wide and half the price of similar models with the same wattage. You can do both hands or feet at the same time. I used CND products (shake well before using) and they worked great with this unit. The bulbs were packed well on the bottom of the box. I thought they plugged in easily. The only thing I would change is the timer only has a 2-3 minute, and continuous setting. A one minute timer would have been nice, but no big deal.</li>
    <li> I read some reviews and some were not good. I love this light! I had no problems with installation of bulbs and the light has worked every time I have used it. It is great for shellac nails! I am loving doing my nails at home!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend purchased this for me because I was borrowing another person&#x27;s light to do my own gel nails. I love this light! It fits both hands or feet in it easily. I use Gelish brand foundation and top coat with various brands colors and this light cures them all. I love that it saves time versus the light I was borrowing, which was only big enough for one hand at a time (thumb separately), and only stayed on for 45 seconds. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lamp to use with Shellac nail kit.  I am a newbie to Shellac.  I have my 1 main about one month ago and went back last week for a re-do.  During both visits was was convinced that I can do it myself.  This lamp met my expectations.</li>
    <li> hi my name is toma i am from georgia-tbilisi i received your lamp but its damaged and i cant use it i dont know what can i do</li>
    <li> Not happy with it&#x27;.  Way tooooo big. No packing slip to return it.  That&#x27;s an alarm.  Please get back to me!  Not the one I wanted!</li>
    <li> I Don&#x27;t see anything listed for this product that states that you have to buy your own UV lights - But all I got was a unit and no bulbs.  So now I have 2 options - buy lights for it somewhere or haul it and pack it for a return.. UGH!!  Amazon offers NO WAY for me to just ask them to ship me the lights nor does the listing even say that lights don&#x27;t come with it.  I am so frustrated!!  I wish they would just send me the lights for it or tell me the lights don&#x27;t come with it but there is no information... just nothing.  Amazon - you are usually much better than this!!</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my daughter, and she just loves it. I really like it also.&lt;br /&gt;It is large enough that your hands fit in without  touching any thing so as not to smudge the polish.&lt;br /&gt;It dries your nails pretty fast, and if you&#x27;re worried about the uv light you can always buy the anti uv gloves which are very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Also this is a nice- looking prouduct.</li>
    <li> This uv light dry my nails very fast, I love the 2 minute and 3 minute feature, be cautious of the continuous feature because after leaving your nails in it for a while it doe&#x27;s get a lil bit hot plus the light is not good for your eyes. Other than that this uv light is awesome. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I bought this lamp an can do my own gel manicures. The open space is wide enough to put both feet and to do a pedicure as well. This has saved me a ton of money having to get gel manicures done at a salon. LOVE</li>
    <li> Great product!  This UV light easily houses both hands or feet at the same time.  You can&#x27;t beat it for the price; I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the ThermaSpa with my initial start up of doing Shellac at home. I read enough reviews that convinced me a lamp is a lamp and decided to not spend more than I had to. I used ThermaSpa for almost a year and was not satisfied with the outcome of my manicures-- they chipped with in two days (never peeled just chip like a regular nail polish) I also found that with the ThermaSpa my nails did not always cure in time (I knew this when wiping the sticky residue with alcohol and finding faint traces of nail color on the pad). Sometimes something strange would happen and I could not get that shinny effect at all after applying the top coat and wiping with alcohol (this was inconsistent and I&#x27;m still not sure what happened during those times)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that my pedicures did last for weeks with the ThermaSpa lamp. I cured for the same time as my hands so I just assumed this was the nature of Shellac-- they didn&#x27;t really last on hands for as long as promised. For me regular pedicures last a long time too. Eventually it became a drag and very time consuming to use Shellac with no lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I already owned a bunch of colors and didn&#x27;t want to waist them all I decided to listen to (what I though was) CND propaganda and purchase the Creative Nail UV Lamp. It made a big difference. My manicures actually last now. I have only used the new lamp a few times but so far had no issues with non curing. As long as the lamp continues working like this I&#x27;ll be very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note the CND UV Lamp is also more solid looking and appears better quality than ThermaSpa</li>
    <li> I wish I could give it 0 stars.  For those of you who gave it glowing reviews, I think you were lucky that you got a lamp that actually works.  The lamp arrived yesterday.  I connected the bulbs and turned it on, and it came on and worked perfectly.  So I took myself to the beauty supply store and spent a fortune on Shellac products, but I figured it was worth it to eliminate $40 trips to the nail salon.  So, came home and started the process, turned on the UV light to test again before I opened all the products, It came on no problem.  Turned it off, and applied the bond and foundation coat.  Lights wouldn&#x27;t come on.  Power was OK, because the Timer lights came on and actually cycled.  But no light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this time fooling around with it, my nails were covered with lint and sticky, so removed everything.  I tried the light again, came on - arghh.  Maybe I did something wrong the first time.  So, reapplied the foundation, light came on, cured my nails.  Applied the bright red polish, looked beautiful.  Turned on the lamp -- nothing.  Timer lights cycle, but no lights.  Nothing I did would get them to come on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this time, my nails were a mess, I&#x27;ve lost my money on the products, had to remove everything, and have wasted 3 hours of my time.  Just tried it again and the lights came on immediately.  But do you think I would trust it again, and start the shellac process AGAIN!  Not on your life -- wish I had read all the reviews before I bought this -- it&#x27;s going back today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: (The next morning)  I&#x27;m a slow learner.  Just before packing it in the box to return, I tried it again. Voila, lights came on.  Turn off, turn on, turn off, turn on - worked every time.  So, I think to myself, I&#x27;m trying this again.  Started over, applied the foundation -- lights came on, cured my nails.  Applied one coat of polish, lights came on, cured the nails, applied second coat of polish and guess what.  No lights, whatever I did, waited, tried again, maybe 50 times -- no lights.  Had to remove second coat with cleanser, so have one coat.  You&#x27;d think I&#x27;d learn.  What is it they say, \\&quot;fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.\\&quot;  This may be the flakiest product I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
    <li> Great for both hands to get the job down. The at home Nail Salon is perfect. Best purchase made in a long time , know I can have my nails done when I want in the comfort of my own  home.</li>
    <li> This nail dryer works great with regular polish too. I have noticed that my nails dry harder and finish looks nicer using this light just don&#x27;t forget the sunscreen to your hands prior to doing your manicure.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves the unit,  Says she is completely satisfied, The Drying time is great , the strenght of the polish is perfect</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Fast service and great product. Thanks. This item is easy to use and is fast and saves money when you do it your self.</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp after reading the reviews.  It&#x27;s quite large but I have arthritis in my hands and it is so easy to use the larger lamp than try to fit my fingers into a smaller lamp without damaging the polish.  It works well.  I decided to try doing my own gel nails rather than pay at the salon every three weeks and I&#x27;m happy that I did.  The salon used a powder gel and that&#x27;s not really what I wanted.  It is also expensive.  Applied my first polish this morning and it was great.  It will take me a few times to get it exactly right because I put a bit too much polish on one finger.  Will be doing better next time.  I figure it will take three applications to break even and then it&#x27;s just the price of the products after that.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to try doing their own nails.  An update to my review after my second application.  I bought some other colours of polish and changed the first colour that I used. It was just so easy and I can&#x27;t imagine paying to get my nails done again.  If you have a friend who will share the cost and buy her own kit then you can easily do each others nails.  I have used the light on 2 minutes for each application of undercoat, polish, and finish coat.  I haven&#x27;t tried less time because I figure it is only two minutes and that&#x27;s pretty much what the salon used.  I have seen some pictures added to some reviews and will try to do this so that the end result can be seen.</li>
    <li> This light works well. It has 3 settings 2 min 3 min and continuous. Bulbs were a snap going in. My only issue is that it is very large yet it is shallow. It will take two hands no problem however you must be careful not to bump back bulbs going in so just be aware of that.</li>
    <li> I like this light better than the IBD 2 hand light. I had no problems assembling it. The bulbs were under the light itself in the box, so I guess that could be confusing. It cures gel really well and I like that there&#x27;s fewer bulbs with more watts. Why mess around with more things to plug in?? I wipe it down at the end of every day and it still looks brand new. I don&#x27;t recommend this for at-home, this is way more than you&#x27;d need outside of a salon. I do think it could be a little deeper... Some clients aren&#x27;t as bright and jam their hands in it and knock off the forms on their nails when they hit the back.</li>
    <li> The Thermal Spa 49135 Nail Dryer works great! I love being able to do this at home and save a lot of $. Once you&#x27;re set up with supplies, the cost is minimal. So much better than going to an expensive nail salon. Layers will be tacky and NOT be dry in between coats even after drying time under the light and thats okay! I didnt know this at first and thought the dryer wasnt working properly. Be sure to read the directions on the base coat and top coat. The most important step is the last, when you clean your nails with the cleanser that removes residue from each nail. Voila! Beautiful nails that last 1-2 weeks depending on how well you applied the coats. Love, love LOVE this machine!</li>
    <li> .  A little bigger than thought. Can do whole hand at once cutting time saving. Works great easy to use timer.</li>
    <li> Good I realy trust in this people! I love the lamp ver good quality! Fo exactly suppossed to do it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with the OPI Gel Starter Kit so that I could do my own nails at home. I love this dryer because it is fast. Has 3 settings 2min 3min and continuous. It also drys quickly. My only complaint is that the other day I used it a lot whole doing my own gel mani and pedi and it over heated and shut it self off. I had to wait until it cooled (just a couple minutes) to turn it back on.</li>
    <li> Happy and satisfied with my light, I have been using it for about 6 months. But I am now looking at a LED light. I&#x27;m well tired of the 2 minute cure time on the gel nails. Wish I would have went with that the first time.</li>
    <li> Work Great, didn&#x27;t take long to dry, very good product! Will recommed to friends.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome! Friends couldn&#x27;t believe it was done by me.</li>
    <li> I bought this light to do at home gel polish manicures.  I love it.  I can put both hands in to dry at the same time.  There isn&#x27;t a 1 minute timer but that doesn&#x27;t stop it from being a great product.  It does have a 2 minute timer and a 3 minute timer which is what is recommended for curing for the polish and top coats.</li>
    <li> I bought this after looking at another one from a beauty supplier and this is twice the size (the other one is a one hand model) at about the same price actually slightly cheaper. My only complaints are its a little hard to set up ONLY because there aren&#x27;t really instructions so I will explain it takes 3 light bulbs inside (I noticed some people thought it only took 2 and we got an extra bulb) and they have to be pushed in to the side (you&#x27;ll probably hear a click) I recommend starting with the bulb in the very back on the wall, you need to put the part of the bulb with writing on it facing you and then it just kind of clicks in then it sticks real decent then do the same with the bulbs that go on the top from back to front make sure the writing faces the bottom of the unit. I used it with the Gelish system today and it cured great, and the only thing is is I have to time is the first coat myself because the base coat is a 1 minute cure so I set it for 2 and then time it myself and shut it off in between steps. Its nice and big (I purposely bought the bigger one because I am kind of clumsy and like extra hand room and I plan on using it to dry polish on my feet faster and my feet need more room. Eventually for my hands I might buy a LED because they cure faster, and stick to this with my feet only, but this is a better price and more versatile than an LED so right now so it was a more important investment.</li>
    <li> This light was a deal!  In just a few manicures, I have saved money on going to get mani&#x27;s.  This is perfect for the person who prefers to do their mani themselves...especially when the only time you have is at night.  The light is a double wide so you can just get both hands done at once!</li>
    <li> Easy to set up, easy to use, there ARE bulbs in the box. I use this to cure Shellac and it works great. Has a timer for 2 minutes and 3 minutes and a setting for continuous light. Instructions are minimal though, be sure you remove the clear plastic packing material from the bottom of the interior of the lamp - the part you will rest your hands on. One nice feature, a raised part on the bottom of the reflective surface so you can feel how far in your hands are, without having to look inside.</li>
    <li> After researching available U/V light nail dryers on Amazaon, I purchased this one becuase of its reasonable cost and what other reviewers wrote about their experience.  I was thrilled with this purchase.  It worked exactly as I had hoped.  My nails cured right away.  I used alcohol to remove the tackiness after my last cure - and I have a great set of nails.  Thanks to all the reviewers - I appreciate your feedback!</li>
    <li> Dears, I have been waiting for the product, I was so happy when the package was arriving to test and to made my mails.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase the items needed to do Shellac nails at home and I am, so far, very pleased with this lamp. I was going to get a smaller and less expensive version, but it looked like there was a wait time for Amazon Prime for it, so I settled on this one and I am so glad I did. If you are doing your own nails, having the ability to cure both hands at the same time cuts down on start to finish time immensely. I was finished in half the time it took them at the salon (I hate sitting there doing nothing while I am getting a manicure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally sold on Shellac-- there is nothing better than having completely dry nails once you have completed your manicure. I am a convert. Four stars because I can&#x27;t comment on the longevity of the unit and one of the lights was flickering a bit, although it didn&#x27;t affect my results-- I will update if this proves to be a real issue.</li>
    <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;Because it do not work in Denmark ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have another electricity....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my item is kaput...&lt;br /&gt;If I just had know that...</li>
    <li> I wanted to do a gel manicure at home and this was the most affordable UV dryer that I found for 2 hands.  I did need some help getting the light bulbs into place (they kept falling out because I was too ginger in putting them in).  I know that directions for gel polish say to put the nails under for 2 minutes, but I find the 3 minute setting to be more apt in curing the nails.</li>
    <li> It works perfect! And for less $$$$, so dont need to buy the cnd that is too much expensive !!</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all as soon as I received it. Returned in right away.</li>
    <li> Paid for itself in two uses.</li>
    <li> Just made a burst sound as soon as it started to work. Such a disappointment</li>
    <li> product works as was advertised and is worth the expense. I recommend the product and merchant.&lt;br /&gt;I rate this merchant an A +++++</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this light to apply my own Gelish nails for about 6 months now. I&#x27;m quite sure it is the same model that was used in the salon where I was first introduced to gel nail polish. My mom and sisters all use it as well, so it gets used quite a bit. It does a bang up job firming up my nails and hasn&#x27;t needed any new bulbs or repairs, even though it has been dropped a couple of times. I&#x27;m really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> ThIs lamp is very nice and roomy. Can fit both my hands in here comfortably. I typically use it for longer than the recommended time though to be sure my nails are dry.</li>
    <li> This light works great for drying my gel polish. I haven&#x27;t seen one at Sally&#x27;s like this. The ones they have are smaller and cost a lot more. I can fit both feet or both hands in at the same time. I love it.</li>
    <li> For some reason the polish does not set, and I have to increase the time to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to save money on having my nails professionally done. At $45 in the salon without a tip, I quickly justified the cost of this machine. The instructions are easy and the buttons on the top are easy to use without smudging my polish.</li>
    <li> I bought this in conjuction with some Gelish gel-nail supplies.  I have used it a few times and the thing has already paid for itself (and that included the various polishes and removers).  I insert both my thumbs first, let them &amp;#34;process&amp;#34; and then insert the other 8 fingers so that THEY can &amp;#34;process.&amp;#34;  The extra-wide opeing allows me to do my gel nails in about a half hour and they look great!  The best part is I do not have to make an appointment and can have beautiful nails whenever I want, at a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> This was great for about ten manicures.  Then, it just stopped working.  Cheaply made.  Very disappointed in the quality of this.</li>
    <li> Good price mediocre product. I have issues keeping the bulbs pushed in all the way so that it works fully.</li>
    <li> I never realized I did not do a review of this.  I have used it for years, its fantastic.  I love that you can put both hands in at the same time.  a must have if you do your own shellac nails.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect lamp for gel manicures--and is large enough for both hands at once.  Timer is easy to access on top, and can be set for continuous, one or two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was right, too!</li>
    <li> Drys gel quickly and allows for both hands or feet to dry at the same time.  My previous nail dryer took forever to get just one hand done at a time.  Very good quality!  I would purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Great price, great product, does both hands in one shot!  Can&#x27;t complain about this at all.  This is also used at one of the &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; day spas in my area.  Price is perfect!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great!  It was a gift for my sister-in-law.  She loves it too. :)  She really loved mine; so I decided to et her one for her birthday.</li>
    <li> I love this lamp. I got it on time. It works great, i use ibd gel. It has a timer and it works good. The reflector is good to. It cures the gel well you always know when you do fills.</li>
    <li> It works ok but takes long to cure the nails and feels really hot within 10mns. LED lights work better.</li>
    <li> Professional grade...awesome product.</li>
    <li> I bought this August 2014. Yesterday both lights fizzled out. For $50, it was not a bargain. Disappointed in lack of quality.</li>
    <li> Great price. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this light.  This 45 watts dryer is perfect for my Shellac manicures.  It dried my nails and I had no issues with bubbling of my CND products.  This will fit both hands with no problem. The bulbs are in the bottom of the box wrapped very well.  I put the tubes in by placing them in the holding brackets first and then that allowed me to line up and push the lights into place.  My unit heats up great and works just fine.  The unit has 3 settings and the best part are these settings are pushed from the front.  Some units the timer is on the back.  You need this unit to perform your Shellac manicures. I use all CND products for my Shellac manicures.  On base coat I dry up to 1 minute, color - 2 minutes and top coat - 2 minutes.  Follow instructions on how to shellac on You Tube under CND how to shellac and also view CND how to remove.  Both You Tube instructions are done by CND.  They are great!!  If you follow exactly how CND indicates---anyone can do this.  Remember to keep off your skin and cuticles for a longer lasting manicure.  I use the CND oil to keep my cuticles from drying out and it keeps them healthy.&lt;br /&gt;4/28/13-This product is working great!  This item was rec&#x27;d on time and is as described.  NOTE: PLEASE LOOK UNDER THE HIDDEN COMPARTMENT IN THE BOTTOM FOR YOUR BULBS.</li>
    <li> Also, for future buyers, I really appreciate a former &#x27;buyer&#x27; posting that she thought they forgot the lightbulb, but it was &#x27;hiding&#x27; in the packaging at the bottom of the box.  I thought they forgot mine, too, saw the bottom of the box, and still didn&#x27;t think it was in there, but it was, just like she said.</li>
    <li> I got tired of spending so much at the nail salon and caved into buying on of these. So glad I did. I used it over the weekend and did a french manicure on myself, love it. I love that it has 3 different settings 2 minutes, 3 minutes and continuous. Perfect!!!&lt;br /&gt;I got this one because of the watts, and it&#x27;s big enough to fit 2 hands. Also because I saw the other reviews the other ladies were writting comparing it to the other products on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommond this for anyone like myself who loves doing nails for fun and not big on going to spend so much at the nail salon and feeling like you have to leave a tip even though it&#x27;s not to your liking. This is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you once again!!</li>
    <li> I just used this dryer for the first time and it worked great! I am impressed with my nails and I will never have to pay for shellac again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this lamp for over two years now. I mostly used Gelish gel polish, since they are easy to buy online and have so many different colors. I haven&#x27;t had any problem. I haven&#x27;t needed to replace the lamp bulb yet--since I use this for mostly myself at home and dont&#x27; use it professionally. (i think professionals replace the bulb after about 1000 uses and I&#x27;m nowhere near that!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been many mishaps in the beginning, but I realize they had nothing to do with the lamp itself. In the beginning, learning to do gel on myself had a learning curve--ie if I put on the layers too thick, the gel will wrinkle under the light; if I don&#x27;t wash my  hands before putting on gel, then they don&#x27;t adhere well because there is oil on the nails; I have to be pretty quick about putting on the polish because the polish will shrink away from the edges and cuticles if I take too long, etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the lamp itself, no prob. The only thing I worry about is the UV light exposure. So I put on the fingerless gloves to protect my hands. I should put on sunblock too but I find it to be too messy  and it&#x27;s hard to not get it on my nails.</li>
    <li> I really like this light, but when I purchased it I didn&#x27;t realize it only has a 2 minute, 3 minute or continuous button. Would have been nice to have a 1 minute option. Aside from that, it gets the job done and I have no complaints after a few months of use!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use it with the gelish nail set. It isn&#x27;t led so it takes a little longer of drying time, but it&#x27;s big enough to fit both hands and feet at the same time. The led ones you have to use one hand or foot at a time so it ends up taking longer anyways. I&#x27;ve used this for over 3 years, about 2x a month and it still works perfectly.  I haven&#x27;t even had to change any bulbs yet! It works perfectly with the gelish nail set. Very happy I got this!</li>
    <li> The bulbs frequently have to be adjusted to make sure they are all on. This is annoying and polish doesn&#x27;t dry as quickly when some of the bulbs are not on. Other than that, works well.</li>
    <li> Works perfect, so happy with it!</li>
    <li> I bought this nail dryer to use for craft projects that need a U/V light.  It works great.  I looked at other nail dryers and they were much more expensive.  This is a well designed product.</li>
    <li> I can not believe this lamp has such a good reviews! I am waiting for half an hour or more to dry my nails and they are still sticky! I was waiting double the time after each layer so I know it&#x27;s not my fault. I wanted to save some money but definitely am returning this one and buying more expensive one that save me time, frustration and actually works!!!</li>
    <li> I am in love with my new uv light! I can fit both of my hands comfortably inside and don&#x27;t have to worry about bumping the lights or messing it up! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lamp instead of the CND product based on price alone.  I have used it twice and have had no issues with curing the shellac.  I do cure for 3 minutes instead of 2 just to be safe.  But so far...wonderful investment.  It is a bit big, but I can do both hands at one time, and I think my size 10 feet will fit in it when I do my toes.</li>
    <li> I almost gave up on uv nail dryers after having a horrible experience with a nail dryer (Epica) bought here on Amazon.com. I gave the thermal spa a try and it&#x27;s fantastic. It dries fast. its easy to assemble and it seems to be a professional product.  So far I saved $400 by doing it home. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase.</li>
    <li> DONT USE AS MUCH AS I THOUGHT I WOULD BUT ITS GREAT NAIL POLISH STAYS ON I LIKE THAT. WOULD USE THEM AGAIN</li>
    <li> salon quality product.  easy to put light bulbs in.  large enough for both hands.  I put one foot in at a time to minimize chance of mess ups.  I have never tried to put both in, but I&#x27;m sure both fit at same time. not battery operated at all.  only plug in.&lt;br /&gt;I have had product for almost a year, with no issues.</li>
    <li> I love this light, you can fit both hands in it and it works great.  I have had it for quite some time now and it still works and I use it a lot.  I am thinking about getting a LED light for faster dry time and I would definitely buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Works very quickly just like the one in the salon, I bought my own home kit and haven&#x27;t been back to the salon,</li>
    <li> My wife loved this for Mother&#x27;s Day. It is a great product because it keeps the nails for longer and they don&#x27;t chip near as much. Happy wife, happy life :)</li>
    <li> I have not used this product as of now. I have many friends that have ordered this same Gel Light Nail Dryer and love it. They are able to both finger nails and toe nails in it. I can not wait to use it myself</li>
    <li> Love it! No problems whatsoever! So far I have done approx 15 manicures for friends and family...everyone loves it!  I found out about this product from my sister in CA...she has had hers for over a year...no problems!</li>
    <li> Just purchased this last week and used it immediately. My nails look amazing and has even stood up to my 10 year olds nail biting (her nails...not mine ;). May never go back to regular polish.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this lamp.  It&#x27;s the perfect size for my table and it cuts my work time drastically.  It cuts down on the risk of nail mess ups that can happen with one hand at a time lamps, too.  In the time I&#x27;ve had it I&#x27;ve not had any problems with its performance and it&#x27;s a great price!  Go for it!</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my daughter that does professional nails....she loves it!!!</li>
    <li> This is the Perfect Gel Nail Dryer...it&#x27;s light-weight, dries nails in a few minutes, works GREAT.  I would recommend to anyone who wants a professional \\&quot;at home\\&quot; gel nail treatment.  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I just unpacked the lamp and was impressed by the size.  I installed the light bulbs carefully using a tissue so as not to get my hand oils on them. I got started right away and just finished my first gel manicure with it.  The longest time was spent letting my regular polish dry.  They recommend 30 minutes at least but I wait 45 and use my hair dryer as well.  Turned out awesome!! The top coat cured in the 2 min and the light shuts off to let you know. I guess if you want a one min. timer, you would have to guess but I would rather over-cure than under-cure.  I filled in the warranty card but I hope I won&#x27;t have to use it.  Just terrific so far!! Highly recommend just for the convenience of doing BOTH hands at once!!  It was only $5 more than the single hand lamp!!</li>
    <li> This was delivered quickly (Prime), easy to assemble, worked immediately and has worked consistently. Size is great for 2 hands or feet. I have no complaints and am happily doing my own gel nails at home!</li>
    <li> Little on bigger side&lt;br /&gt;But good enough</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift but didn&#x27;t get to see it in action and it works very well the price was right and the ability to do two hands at once is a timesaver!</li>
    <li> LOVE this - works great, saves a ton of time and money not having to go to the salon!</li>
    <li> Leaves nails tacky and ugly. It&#x27;s not a good product. It does not work with shellac/gel nail polish. Bad product. Never purchase again. Sad thing is I have to keep it since I bought it as a Christmas present so I waited to long to try it out. Oh well-lesson learned</li>
    <li> The Thermal Spa 49135 is a good product for the price.  You have to give your nails extra drying time to make sure they are cured properly, but for the price tag, this is reasonable.  Very good U/V dryer for the money.</li>
    <li> It seems to take longer to dry than at the salons for the gel polish, but the key is using rubbing alcohol before drying. Works well. As described, but big and bulky</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to do my own gel nails at home.  It works great.  I love that I can dry both of my hands or feet at the same time, if I want to.  It works great with the OPI gel polish.  I just do the longer cure time that is listed on the chart that came with the polish.  I have used it a handful of times and am very happy with the outcome.  My nails last 2+ weeks.  This is a great value for the money, and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have had this for shellac-ing for over a year now. Still has the same lights and is super durable.</li>
    <li> Great u/V light nail Dryer. Better the the CND one I bought because i can put both hands in at once and I like the timer features. Very easy to use!</li>
    <li> Used with the gelish polish etc it is just like the salon. I don&#x27;t use regular polish anymore because this is dry when you finish...much easier.</li>
    <li> Very good ! I dropped it few times and surprise it s still working well  !</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my grand daughter and she loves it</li>
    <li> Great product for the money.</li>
    <li> It works; does the job. Design is nothing exciting nor is color of unit, but the price is also quite fair for a higher-quality, near-pro unit.</li>
    <li> This nail dryer works great for home use.  Used to stand and wave my hands in the air for 5 minutes or more. Now I just put them under the light for 2 minutes ad they dry quickly and my polish is harder than it normally dries.</li>
    <li> One of the bulbs would not work.  I asked for the seller to send me a replacement bulb.  This was not acceptable, so I had to return the unit for refund.  I really wanted a working nail dryer, not a refund, but that was the only option allowed. I will not buy from them again.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> great product, great price...... this baby is still going strong.</li>
    <li> I have done solar nails for several years but acrylic for about 30 years. I am not a nail tech. This is a great curer for either solar or acrylic and after reading reviews, also gel nails. I have too much invested in acrylic powders, glitter and such to try gel. it sounds way too complicated. This is my second dryer, just like the first one. I didn&#x27;t need a new one but I couldn&#x27;t get over the low cost. Got it for like 44.00 and paid 150.00 for the first one, same model, brand, everything, great as a back up.</li>
    <li> I received unit and put the lightbulbs in. When I turned it on only 2 of the 3 lightbulbs worked.  Looked online to think about just buying a new lightbulb but it was $12.00.  Shouldn&#x27;t have to spend 60.00 AND have to buy a replacement lightbulb before you even use it once.  Sent back for refund.</li>
    <li> This product arrived in a timely manner &amp; worked exactly as described. I completed my first at home shellac manicure in conjunction with the top &amp; base coat and color that I also bought here on Amazon; it turned out AWESOME. So easy, so quick. I love that this product has a timer, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about setting a timer each time, simply hit the button &amp; the lights will shut off when your 2 or three minutes are up. The system also has a continuous setting if you wish to use that. The opening is large enough for both of my hands or feet to fit in, which further cuts down on the time I have to spend fussing over nails; and that makes me happy! :) This is a great product &amp; great value. I def recommend.&lt;br /&gt;*PS I also bought the UV protection gloves here on amazon, and they are equally awesome! They will protect your hands &amp; arms from the UV rays from this product, because after all, you want beautiful nails AND hands! :)</li>
    <li> I was very excited to order this lamp due to it&#x27;s affordability, how large it was and the previous reviews were very positive. I received the product very fast and it was very easy to assemble. The curing time took longer then expected but it did the job. I was very happy with Thermal Spa until it malfunctioned after the 5th or 6th use. I would plug it in and the lights would just flash (flicker). I was not able to get it to work properly again. I tried to exchange it and was very disappointed to learn I was a few days past the return date. It was a fight to get a refund for this defective product but Amazon eventually worked with me. I chose not to re-order and decided to buy a more expensive lamp that came with a warranty. The price is inviting but the product is disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer</li>
    <li> this two handed lamp was convenient, but the bulbs came loose several times through out the use.  but once engaged the lamp worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love my u/v light nail dryer. it works perfect, received my order 3 days after ordering. Arrived very well packaged. I only wish it had a small shield on the front to help keep the light out of eye when using it.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these units my wife has purchased. My wife uses this approximately 2 times/week as she does her and some of her friend&#x27;s nails. Given the fairly regular amount of use (and the thing being toted around all over the place) I feel that it has held up fairly well. When the first unit&#x27;s bulb burned out following a year of regular use, we looked at replacing the bulb only to find that it is more cost effective to just replace the entire unit (unless you have a source of cheap bulbs). To be fair, I did not research replacement bulbs much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product as it is one of the less expensive UV lights on the market.</li>
    <li> The item came very quickly and was exactly what I wanted. Just had to insert the UV bulbs and cord and it was ready to go. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with it!</li>
    <li> This has worked really well for me. I&#x27;ve never used one before so I have nothing to compare it to but i like it, it works well for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few years now and I love it.  Works perfectly!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this light twice now.  Someone dropped the first one😁 Size works great for two hands or feet.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with Gelish polish and it works well and my nails are still nice a week later.</li>
    <li> This is a great gel light nail dryer, I usually use the 2 minute timer and have not had any problems, The price. Is great to. I would highly recommend this light.</li>
    <li> I use this dryer at home every two weeks or so. It fits very comfortably two feet or two hands. The preset timer is super convenient. You can set it for 2 or 3 minutes and it will shut off when done.</li>
    <li> I bought this U/V light to do my gel manicures. I absolutely love it. I fit two hands or two feet easily. I removed one bulb because it was too hot!</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift for the Mrs... she uses it consistently. She gets salon quality nails at home, at least that&#x27;s what she says...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY: Wife happy, me happy.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic for maintaining your nails between manicures.  I really do love it and recommend it highly.  The price was really good too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the lamp about 10 times now and I love it.  I&#x27;ve only used CND gel polish so far and it works perfectly.  Nice to be able to do my own gel manicures.</li>
    <li> Product performed as described. Installing the lights was easy. I like the fact that I can apply polish and to all10 nails and cure them all at once. When curing, I use the 3 minute setting, using the 2 minute setting didn&#x27;t seem to finish but that could have been due to my thicker application than I subsequently used as I gained experience.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT SHOWED TO BE A VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND IS STILL WORKING PERFECTLY  I WOULD PURCHASE ANOTHER ONE IF NEEDED</li>
    <li> I like this light and have had it for a while. It is still going strong. Not looking forward to ordering replacement bulbs!</li>
    <li> After getting gel nails at a salon and paying a ton for them, I ended up purchasing my own supplies on Amazon.  This light is great for all types of polish.  When I polish my 10 yo nails, even regular polish will last for at least a week, if not more, thanks to this light.  Without the light, we were lucky to get through one day.  Shipping was great, and all arrived in working order.</li>
    <li> Received Nail Dryer but it had absolutely no bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;I had to order bulbs seperately so hopefully it will work.</li>
    <li> When researching Light Nail Dryers, I kept coming across this Thermal Spa and decided based on its price and size to order it. I&#x27;m so glad I did! This dryer works perfectly for my Gelish manicures!  It is large enough for both hands--which doesn&#x27;t even compare to the size of other similar and much more expensive products.  Seller shipped quickly. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I first bought this lamp from another seller, but had to return it since two of the lights (the top ones) came damaged. I switched the lightbulbs around, thinking that it was not the actual product but the bulbs, but it didn&#x27;t work. Then, I ordered from another seller (thinking he problem may have been packaging issues) and for the first two manicures the lamp worked fine. Now, one of the lights doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I really don&#x27;t care now if it&#x27;s the actual lamp or the lightbulb, but I&#x27;m fed up with it and will have to buy another one.</li>
    <li> I purchased the lamp and the CND polish........my nails nook beautiful. Instead of driving to the salon and sitting and waiting, I did my nails in the comfort of my home while watching T.V. I AM TOTALLY SATISFIED with the product. I read some reviews that people have trouble putting in the lights............I don&#x27;t know why??? Took me about 3 minutes to put them in. The first time I turned all the lamp all the bulbs came on just fine!!! MY NAILS LOOK GREAT!! VERY SATISFIED!!!</li>
    <li> works great for regular nail polish; however, it does not completely dry my schellac which is why I purchased this light. When I get schellac done at a nail salon, the polic typically stays on for 2 weeks. When I do it at home with this light, it lasts about 3 days before the polish starts to peel off :( If this same dryer had stronger uv lights available for purchase I would definitely try those though.</li>
    <li> Had shopped locally for a inecxpensive nail dryer and this was by far the best value for the dollar!! I would recommend this company for future orders</li>
    <li> So far so good, I like that I can do two hands at once....big time saver.  I had no problem installing lights but manufacturer should mark where they are almost hidden in the box.  I have only used twice so still getting the hang of it.  The first set peeled off, polish was too thick and be careful not to put polish on cuticle.  Does anyone have any suggestions for getting polish off?  In the salon, they use cotton soaked in acetone and wrap in foil and then put under dryer for 2 mins.  There is a product where you soak your nails in solution for 20 mins. which sounds a bit harsh plus time-consuming.</li>
    <li> very good product....&lt;br /&gt;love it....  worth it... thank you... ok this thing makes you keep writing words... maybey thats why i never presonded...</li>
    <li> Have had it for two years love it only thing is shellac Polish does tend to try your cuticles but they do last a lot longer than jamberry stick on or regular polish.</li>
    <li> This might have been a good product - but I&#x27;ll never know because it was shipped without a bulb. Now I don&#x27;t trust the company to really be giving me a product that is what they say it is because of the shipping error. So, I&#x27;m returning it and ordering from another vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would think that a U/V Gel Light would have a bulb with it....</li>
    <li> The title pretty much says it all. I was disappointed that the dryer didn&#x27;t come with bulbs but the product itself works great.</li>
    <li> Time to say goodbye to those expensive salon manicures!  This nail dryer is the same one used by my manicurist. I&#x27;ve use it for several months now with no problems.  Initially I used Gelish gels and got excellent results.  Remember to use very, very thin applications. It&#x27;s much better to apply one coat than slop up your cuticles!  I recently switched to Orly GelFX, which can be cured by an LED light, but the Thermal Spa UV light works just fine. Just cure for the regular amount of time.  Highly recommend this light for the price.</li>
    <li> Received mine with no light bulbs? Searched every bit of packaging, they aren&#x27;t here. Couldn&#x27;t tell you how it works. :-/</li>
    <li> Slightly larger than I anticipated, but well worth the size. I used on regular nail polish (still waiting on my UV polish to arrive) and it worked wonders even on that. Def. Recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have done my own gel nails at home.  I bought the top, base and Romantique polish by CND Shellac.  I followed Stephanie Hodges review and my nails turned out perfect!  Thanks Stephanie! I was able to do both hands at once which was nice.  It arrived packaged very well, all the lights worked, very easy to use.  I&#x27;m very happy with this lamp/nail dryer, worth the money to be able to do my own gel nails at home and save me lots of dollars at the salon.</li>
    <li> I am loving my light.</li>
    <li> Soon as I took it out of the box and put the bulbs in it wouldn&#x27;t work.. When it did turn on only two bulbs would work!!! Very disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this but never used it until today. Only 1 of the 3 lights work and I tried to adjust it but short of holding it in place the entire time it does not maintain the electrical contact.  A real pile of junk.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed this light.  It worked for me to cure my cnd nails.  It&#x27;s been about a year since I bought this light and my polish doesn&#x27;t last as long.  I need to buy some replacement bulbs and they are over $13 a piece!  That&#x27;s almost $30 to replace these bulbs!!!  That is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!  I will make the investment because it&#x27;s still cheaper than getting them done, but still....</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel this product got the rating it deserved. It takes washy took long to dry nails.</li>
    <li> This a great UV lamp.  Had it now for a couple of months and have used it quite alot.  No problems and works well with ibd gel builder I use over my tips.  I decided to get the lamp due to chipping after I had my nails done at the salon.  I find that when I would normally go in for a fill in I can buff my nails at the cuticle line blending in the growth and reaply the gel and extend the life of my nails.  I usually can wait another week maybe two without going back for a fill in.  The savings in doing this has already paid for this UV lamp.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble. Works great with OPI GelColor. Use 2-3-3-3 for timing. Big enough to put both hands in at the same time. Don&#x27;t forget to wipe the nails with rubbing alcohol at the end. Voila!</li>
    <li> Nice and large to fit both hands.  The light is a little weak, however I just put hands in longer and that solved the problem.  I put sunscreen on the hands before I start to prevent burning.</li>
    <li> I decided to try doing my own gel manicures at home when I became increasingly frustrated with the inconsistent quality and high price of gel manicures at local nail salons. I&#x27;ve been at it for 9 months now, using this Thermal Spa UV lamp. The lamp works great, has a 2 and 3 minute timer, is lightweight and even though I have banged it around a few times, it works beautifully! Be aware if you are using a Gelish Polish system, you will need an LED lamp. This UV lamp will NOT cure Gelish polish. I use my Thermal Spa lamp with CND Shellac polishes. Many nail techs told me and I have seen for myself, that Shellac is less damaging to the nail bed- no harsh filing is necessary to remove the gel.  Only 5 minutes of soaking in acetone and the Shellac polish comes right off.</li>
    <li> I was able to do an at home manicure, and it lasted two weeks and it looked just as if I went to the salon... I used CND gel nailpolish with this machine.</li>
    <li> I have went through disappointing nail dryers (LED lamps from various brands and one UV nail dryer that wouldn&#x27;t turn on), but I saw such great reviews on this one, so I wanted to give it a try (the only thing that could be worse than my previous experiences is the item getting lost in the shipping process).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the package came, I opened it and was surprised! I ordered a &amp;#34;used-good&amp;#34; nail dryer, but it looked brand new! I took the nail dryer out and plugged in the UV lights with no problem (they do not wiggle in the socket such as previous nail dryers have and this nail dryer have clips that hold the UV lights in place). I tried using my Red Carpet gel nail polish and the polish dried with no problem what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are timers on this nail dryer. The options you can select from are 2 minutes, 3 minutes, and unlimited. For my gel polish, 2 minutes is perfectly fine with each coat and the polish drys quickly with the wattage the UV lights give off. I would assume the other two settings are for if you do both hands together or just don&#x27;t want to turn the light off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned above, you can fit BOTH hands or feet in this dryer. Instead of paying a high price for two separate UV lamps, this lamp is much cheaper than the other lamps I have tried. I would highly recommend buying this lamp! It may be a bit more expensive, but this lamp is definitely worth the extra money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps those who are contemplating which lamp to buy!</li>
    <li> The light was broken when i received it from amazon - was cheaply made for the price paid. Very disappointed and would not recommend. Much better u/v lights out there for same or better price.</li>
    <li> When I first received my Thermal Spa UV nail dryer, I was having trouble getting the light bulbs to turn on because I was worried that I would break them. I was able to find a review that explained that, when installing the bulbs, there would be an audible &#x27;click&#x27; once they are put in place and properly installed. Once the dryer was ready, I was able to start using it for gel manicures! I bought the gelish brand of gel nail polish and I have done four manicures so far. Every one of them has turned out wonderfully! This is a fantastic purchase for anyone looking to perform at home gel manicures. :)</li>
    <li> The lights are at the bottom of box!  x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x</li>
    <li> This UV Light was a lot bigger then expected, you can do both feet or hands at once with it.  I like the timer, it makes things a lot easier.</li>
    <li> It came on the time expected, but one of the Bulb( lamp) was not working. Because of that I don&#x27;t want to try and wait for them to replace because even though if I still don&#x27;t like they will be discount on my refund money. To return I have to pay for the shipping. Look at the email I received today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thank you for your email. Just to be clear. The bulb will solve the problem with the lamp, all you need to do is wait until it arrives and you will have a working unit. If you do not wish to receive the replacement bulb and would rather just get a refund, you will need to send the unit back to us at your expense. This will be considered a matter of preference. Once we receive the unit we will inspect the it and process a refund. The refund will be minus the shipping we paid to send the unit to you in the first place. You can send the unit to the address below. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a customer with amazon for so long, this is my first time having problem to return a item.&lt;br /&gt;I totally hate companies with poor costumer service</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad light but my bulbs turn off randomly when in use. It still works.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes of finally getting my natural nails to grow, I have been using it in conjunction with a product called rejuvacote, a nail srengthener.  I was just about to get fake nails my were looking so bad, when I started to think about getting my nails done at the salon, and how they always put you under a UV light to help bake your polish to a hard, durable finish; so I started looking on Amazon for a UV light to go with my new strengthener, and this was my pick.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light weight, has 3 settings, 2 min, 3 min, and continuous, and also it has an on and off switch so that you can turn off the indicator light, which is good for saving electricity.  It is big enough to fit both of your hands or feet in at the same time, which is really helpful.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month with the rejuvacote and my nails haven&#x27;t looked this good in years!! This was a little more than I wanted to spend, but I figured that the cost of having fake nails put on would have been around the same price and then I would have had to keep going to the salon to keep them up.  Now I can do them myself at home with great results and they are my own natural nails!&lt;br /&gt;This was one of the best beauty investments that I have made in a while, so I even got some excellent glass nail files and a professional cuticle trimmer set all from amazon; even with all of these items and some new nail colors, I still figure I am under the cost of 2 times at the salon and once again these are my real nails!  :)</li>
    <li> The best quality you could look for, i love the fact that it fits both hands/feet, i&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months now with no problems</li>
    <li> This light was HORRIBLE.  Not only did it get hot to the point where I felt like my toes were going to catch fire, but it did not cure my nail polish in the normal time suggested.  It does not have a fan in it, after two unsuccessful attempts of curing my shellac with this light (2x the recommended time, still not dry for each coat)-- I then tried putting a little fan next to it thinking it might help-- it didn&#x27;t.  I wish I didn&#x27;t throw away the box right away, otherwise I would&#x27;ve returned it.  Do not waste your money!! Makes me wonder if some of the reviews on here are FAKE.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to obtain this since I can cure all brands of gel&#x27;s with an UV light. This one has the added bonus that I can do both hands and both feet at the same time. Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Gift for daughter.  Loved it</li>
    <li> I like the Light, however, their directions are ridiculous.  Nothing explaining how to or to put the bulbs in.  Nothing about how to remove the bottom for cleaning.  They need to re-vamp the directions entirely.</li>
    <li> This light is huge, big enough for both hands.  It does the job.  My only complaint is where to store it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it. Very easy to setup and get running. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> No complaints yet.  Very spacious - will hold both hands or both feet at the same time comfortably.  Good clearance and has 3 choices for time sets.  The bulbs were packed so well I could not find them at first and thought it had been shipped without the bulbs!  Were easily installed</li>
    <li> this works great to dry my gel nails!!! good quality and would recommend to anyone wanting to do their own nails.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because a friend recommended it because she purchased one and loved it.  I must say that I also love it and it works great.  I would most definetely suggest this item to my friends.</li>
    <li> i have been using this for gel nails CND i have noticed that it works better if i use it on the 3 min setting not the 2 min because the polish takes a little longer to dry... i am putting a thin coat of polish on so i knw its not because its to thick, and when i use alcohol to wipe of at the end im still getting a bit of polish, but overall seems to be a good light.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed that the first time I went to us the item, all 3 UV bulbs did not work, so I could not do my nails with the shellac i had also bought (gel from a different supplier). I cant seem to reach the supplier for this UV nail dryer either, so have no way to even get the bulbs replaced. Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> Luv it!  This is a really affordable home-based solution...I&#x27;ve seen similar (or maybe the identical one) in nail salons.  Fast dry-time for gels/shellac and even a fan for regular nail polish.  It&#x27;s a spacious comfortable fit for either your hands or your feet.  Purchased in the June 2012 and arrived within 5 days.</li>
    <li> Correction!!! No sooner did I get my nail polish order, plugged the machine in for the 3rd time, it stopped working completely.  I&#x27;m going to try to contact the seller and see if they&#x27;ll replace the unit.</li>
    <li> I received the unit WITHOUT ANY BULBS AT ALL!!!!  The description said there would be bulbs included.  I am so very disappointed.  Looks like a nice unit, lots of weight to it....however....What good is it without any bulbs?  May as well place my freshly polished nails in the refrigerator to dry  (oooops, there is at least a bulb in there).  Piece of junk, RETURNING ASAP!!</li>
    <li> This is a great UV nail lamp. I love that you can do both hands or feet at the same time. I had no problems installing the bulbs like some other people have complained about in other reviews. I think this was a wonderful product for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and daughter. They absolutely Love it.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly to give you a professional gel manicure at home.</li>
    <li> after reading all the reviews i easily felt comfortable purchasing this light. i have since bought it for a friend. it works perfectly and you can fit two hands in it at once! awesome deal for the price. i&#x27;m sure you can find a cheaper light but you wont find a better one.</li>
    <li> I really love this item. It comes with 3 new UV bulbs that heat up quickly. It&#x27;s just like the one my salon uses. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s large enough for 2 hands to fit inside and is lightweight so you can move it around as needed without breaking a nail (&amp;lt;----get it??).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it with the Gelish line and it works great. I went to Gelish&#x27;s web page to get directions (just Google them and it will come up) for their particular polish. It worked like a charm. I also bought CND products which I am sure will work perfectly too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Nailene kit from a drug store originally, but decided to go with this one instead and buy the polish separately because this unit is so much larger than the Nailene one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want professional-style nails, this is the light for you! And by the time you factor in free shipping for Prime members, it&#x27;s a no-brainer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps and enjoy your new nails!</li>
    <li> I used CND shellac basecoat (10 sec), CND color (2 min.) and CND topcoat (2 min.) followed by a 70% alcohol wipe to remove the tacky layer and solar oil massaged into cuticles. Perfection!  I&#x27;m absolutely delighted!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product. Very cheaply made. The lights dont work properly. Seemed to be a short. I thougth initially that it was me and that i didnt get the bulbs in correctly but you can feel them snap in. It is just not a well made product and wouldnt recommend buying. So disappointed because I was so excited about this product.</li>
    <li> The best product ever!!</li>
    <li> The item was in perfect condition.  It came when it said it would without delay.  I bought one for my neice and she loved it so I got one for myself</li>
    <li> This is a great size for fitting two hands or two feet, its easy to use and install the bulbs. My only concern is the drying time, it takes at least 15 min. to thoroughly dry your nails with this dryer even though the timer on the machine has a 2 min. and a 3 min. option, fortunately it also have a &amp;#34;continuous&amp;#34; option for a longer drying time. I would recommend more research before purchasing this dryer, however it does get the job done.</li>
    <li> This product works perfectly for my gel nails, is big enough for both hands or both feet, and is well made. I am very happy with this purchase and have already recommended it to family members. This UV light is an excellent value!</li>
    <li> I bought this  UV light,great product,lots of room to do both hands and also does a great job on feet, I would recommend this item</li>
    <li> This light holds 2 hands at one time. It cures the gel polishes and gel extensions. I have used CND, Gelish, Young Nails systems and all have cured with no problems. I will buy another to put into my salon.</li>
    <li> I am an amateur at best and I&#x27;ve used this UV lamp several times on myself and others. Read all the instructions and tips in previous reviews, they are life-savers! Also, make sure you seal the color coat properly or it will chip. Try not to tap your fingers inside the lamp or you will hit one of the lights and ruin your manicure!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife so that she could begin to do her own nails quickly and efficiently on those weeks when she couldn&#x27;t make it to the nail shop. SHe loves it!! its fast and easy. Both hands fit in at the same time and it also works great for your  feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this light, plugged in the bulbs and it wouldn&#x27;t work. I was so mad and was looking at sending it back and was freaking out because I had appointments and needed a lamp ASAP. I requested a return and was about to order a different one when I came across a review that said you have to push the bulbs in really hard and listen for a click and they will work, so I tried this and it worked I was so happy that I didn&#x27;t get screwed on this product. You will feel like you are going to break the bulb but just push it in tight!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used the Gel Light Nail Dryer 3 times now. I am so happy with it. I&#x27;m glad I went for the one that was a little bigger and a bit more expensive than some.</li>
    <li> This machine rocks! You can fit both hands in with ease. Was easy to set up.  Very durable.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my gelish manicures and it works perfect. It&#x27;s big enough for both hands or both feet. Would definitely recommend and the price is just right.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to go ahead and order it.  The first time I used it, it worked great.  The second and third time it stopped working in the middle of doing my nails.  I fiddled with the lights, unplugged it and turned it back on.  Nothing.  Waited a couple of hours and it worked.  Fourth time it just stopped working and never came back on. I guess you get what you pay for.  Sending it back.</li>
    <li> I had a gel nail polish manicure done in New York in June. And, after being so pleased with the length of time that manicure&#x27;s polish lasted, I had to do that again!  Unfortunately, on my island in the Caribbean, I have yet to find a manicurist that does this type of manicure. So, i decided to buy the stuff and do it myself!  Bearing in mind that i am not a professional manicurist, I used the lamp right out the box (after installing the bulbs ad following the instructions) and I love it!  I have done 2 manicures in three weeks for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I also use CND Shellac polishes and Royal anti-UV gloves.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, this lamp is better than the one used by the NY manicurist as both hands can fit in at once.  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> worked very well Thanks</li>
    <li> Light bulbs get loose very easily</li>
    <li> I just got my Thermal Spa light today and did my manicure right when I got it! It rocks; it does exactly what it is supposed to do. I have been getting shellac manicures at a salon for about a year now and have always wanted to do my own. It&#x27;s obviously cheaper, so if you can paint your own nails with nail polish then you&#x27;re definitely capable of doing your own gels. I highly recommend this product. Save yourself some money and do it yourself! One thing I will say is make sure you &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; the bulbs in place when assembling this product. I did my whole manicure not realizing one bulb was not properly locked in; you should hear a click to ensure its in place. That being said my gels still cured with only two bulbs working! Like I said this light is great so disregard all negative reviews, I did and I am more than satisfied :)</li>
    <li> Excellent. Dries nails in about 9 mins worth the price for any one that does they&#x27;re nails at home</li>
    <li> I would have bought a less pricier light but this is the one I used at my friends house and I liked it. I used it with regular nail polish and it was a breeze since my nails were dry so much quicker and I noticed that they didn&#x27;t chip at all but instead grew out, which is unusual for me. Unfortunately this splurge ended up with me purchased a shellac kit making it much pricier, but I&#x27;m loving the new manicures and it&#x27;s better for my nails as the tend to chip and split very close to the skin. Still wonder if I could have gone with a smaller version for less money but figured I should go with something I&#x27;ve already tested. The lights were easy to install and the timer is very handy.</li>
    <li> Received product and it was used and the power cord was missing!  Very unhappy buyer.</li>
    <li> exactly what my sons girlfriend wanted.  She was so excited to get this for Christmas.  Love it for her. thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and a half now and I&#x27;m very pleased.  I read so many reviews when shopping for a lamp.  I wanted to be able to do my own gel nails and save that $40 I  was spending every two weeks.  I&#x27;d NEVER done gel  nails before, so I wanted a good quality lamp.  For the price, this is a great lamp.  I store it in the box, in the bubble wrap wrapper, very careful with it.  I don&#x27;t want to have to replace lamps anytime soon lol.  If your head is spinning from reading all the reviews on the hundreds of lamps out there, just know that I&#x27;m a complete novice and this lamp works wonderfully for me.  I&#x27;m now doing my own nails, and the nails of all my coworkers and friends now too. lol</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! ITS PERFECT! VERY SPACIOUS INSIDE. EASY &amp; FAST TO INSTALL THE BULBS. THE TIMER😊 COULDN&#x27;T HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER DEAL ON A UV LAMP!</li>
    <li> This is my first review on any product I&#x27;ve purchased through Amazon, and let me tell you that this stuff is awesome! Its a little big so its not something you can carry around or travel with (unless you don&#x27;t mind it), but its perfect! It is big enough to fit your entire hand and a foot (if you want to do a gel pedi). I am really happy about it :)</li>
    <li> Great quality. Shipped fast and is very well built. Smaller lights were over $150 each and were much smaller in size.</li>
    <li> The wife really liked this surprise and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This machine is great.  I bought 2 because I use it at my home and Apt. and don&#x27;t want to be left without it and was tired on bringing the back and forth.  Great unit and great price!</li>
    <li> Okay my parents bought this dryer for my birthday. I just got my CND Shellac base, top and color coats. I followed the instructions on the Best Review (usually at top) and my nails came out great. Cured fantastically ! I love this Thermal Spa dryer and works great with Shellac. I think my only tip would be &#x27;Keep it thin to win&#x27;, with the coats and keep in a bit from nail sidewalls, especially if you have deep sidewalls. My side walls are deep and my first time I put it on too thick. It cured great but pooled in the sidewalls. I knew which dryer to buy because when I went to have a salon day last year, they used this dryer on my gel manicure. They are an upscale salon and I figured if they use it, it has to be one of the better ones. Don&#x27;t let the price fool you !  It really is a great product. I recommend to all. Another tip is to have 100% acetone available, that way if you have to clean up a spot where polish got on your fingers you can do so before curing etc. I love Shellac and will never go back to regular polish. The time saved by drying alone is worth it ! Love it Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have one already and love it.  Bought this one as a gift.</li>
    <li> To answer a frequently asked question, this dryer will not dry regular nail polish. I wrote to the company and they emailed me back. Gel polish only. It&#x27;s a beautiful piece of equipment! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who does her own manicures. There are lots of info sites on the internet, with videos (i.e., Sally Hansen, Nutranail), that show how to apply and remove gel polish. Getting them done professionally is rather expensive, so the ThermalSpa gel dryer will help save big bucks in the long run.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift along with Gelish gel polishes. It&#x27;s the only dryer that fits both hands/feet at the same time. Plus, it&#x27;s an affordable price. It works great! so much fun :)</li>
    <li> Love the built in timers! Came in and plenty of room for both hands. I still do the thumbs separately.</li>
    <li> Stopped working 40 days later with 5 uses. Changed bulbs still did not work!This product was a dream the 1st 5 times it was used. The lights on top work but seem to have a problem with the eletcity loop getting to the bulbs</li>
    <li> Okay so I was reading the reviews everyone posted, shellac is really awesome but its not for everyone! This lamp and products are very awesome to use you can definitely save a lot of time on your nails drying! Since the machine does it for you. Someone said it was hard to take off but what you need to do to remove shellac polish cnd/ and or OPI polish first you need to rub your nails with acetone, then place cotton balls full of acetone on each finger wrap them with alumininum foil. Let them soak for at least 15-20 min. (Some peoples nail time vary). Then you take a metal cuticle pusher(after you have removed cotton and aluminum foils) you will notice that polish has become much softer so  then you lightly push off polish and you&#x27;ll see that your nails are not damaged! Unlike acrylic, shellac is much more convenient for your nails. By the way I am a licensed cosmetologist I hope the info on taking off polish has helped!</li>
    <li> I used the instructions in the first review by Stephanie, and it worked great using OPI Gel Color. Using the rubbing alcohol to remove the tacky layer at the end of topcoat is key! Being able to get both hands in there is also great. Why shell out $200-$300 for the polish company lights when this works fine?</li>
    <li> It is bigger than I thought, but it has been awesome having a salon type set up at home.  With 3 girls they have salon parties with their friends and it saves lots of cash.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love this lamp. I think it works much better than the Gelish mini LED lamp. It cures my Gelish nail polish perfectly. Only problem I have found is that the bulbs fall out occasionally.</li>
    <li> I used this three times and three sets of two bulbs per set burned out.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s big enough to fit both my feet in for drying toes.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, is that it seems almost too strong, and that makes me nervous with regard to the whole skin cancer thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you&#x27;re looking to dry your nails super fast, it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> The Thermal Spa does well with drying regular nail polish. However, I purchased it for the specific purpose of drying Gel polish which it does not do. I&#x27;ve left my hand in the dryer for almost 10 minutes once and still the gel would not dry.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s big and roomey, plenty room for hand or foot without accidental smudges. I&#x27;ve used it once and it couldn&#x27;t be easier.</li>
    <li> Tip. The Difference between UV gel lamp and LED lamp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UV lamp&lt;br /&gt;Is More affordable.&lt;br /&gt;It uses more energy&lt;br /&gt;Bulbs need to be replaced periodically&lt;br /&gt;Curing Time 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Effectively cures ALL types of builder gel products and polish gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LED gel lamp&lt;br /&gt;Saves energy&lt;br /&gt;Curing time 30 seconds&lt;br /&gt;Use less energy and more eco-friendly&lt;br /&gt;Bulbs last the life of the lamp, no need for replacement of the bulbs&lt;br /&gt;Generally more expensive, though prices are starting to come down&lt;br /&gt;Only cures polishes that are formulated for LED technology.&lt;br /&gt;Chicklettes.Andrea. 2013</li>
    <li> Wrong voltage for EU as it is a US spec, it would require a very expensive transformer which unfortunately costs more than the product</li>
    <li> This is a great product and as good as professional shops use. Very easy to use and fast. Enjoy the fact that I can do my nails at home any time I feel ready. Unfortunately the  machine was damaged on the top and I wasn&#x27;t informed of that fact. I would purchase this product again but probably from a different dealer.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this light.  Makes doing gel nails easy and faster than the small ones that you can only fit 4 fingers in.  Can fit both hands in at once if you wanted to do it that way</li>
    <li> Works fine, good price, I use it for my at home gel nails.  Somewhat concerned about the the potential for damage to my skin by the UV light.</li>
    <li> When I received the Thermal Spa the lights did not work. I contacted the seller and was instructed to contact the manufacturer of the spa, to get replacement bulbs. The manufacturer informed me the seller was to replace the bulbs. I waited &amp;#62; 1 month to receive the bulbs. When I put the new bulbs in the unit, 2 of the bulbs blew immediately when the unit was turned on. I attempted several times to contact the seller and did not get a reply. I have emailed and phoned the seller, to this day  the seller has not returned my call.</li>
    <li> As a gel nail polish newbie, I read all the reviews and ultimately purchased the Thermal Spa 49135 U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer, then purchased Shellac polish from the CND line to use with it. Others have described the process, so I won&#x27;t go into that. Finding the bulbs under the false floor of the box and inserting them in the machine was a no brainer. I&#x27;m not sure what all the fuss was about in some other reviews. Really, folks, come on. How hard can it be?&lt;br /&gt;It was difficult to believe that the process would yield results including two full weeks of perfect nails, but it&#x27;s really true! When selecting which gel light machine to purchase, I was not at all sure whether I would prefer a machine that could handle only one hand, or one that could manage two, especially since the larger machine is pretty big, and I would have to find a place to store it (Think smallish toaster oven). When I started using my new machine, it all came clear. If you&#x27;re trying to decide on this point, here&#x27;s what I recommend: if you&#x27;re doing your own nails, you might want to consider using a machine that can handle both hands. If someone else is working on your nails, a one-hander would be work just fine, but I still recommend this machine for its value.&lt;br /&gt;A few other tips: The instructions on how to apply polish say to wipe the nails with alcohol as the final step, to eliminate the tackiness. \\&quot;Really?\\&quot;, I said? It seemed so counter-intuitive. Well, it&#x27;s true folks. You really put a cotton pad saturated with alcohol right on that sticky, tacky nail that you&#x27;ve just finished, and wipe off the tackiness. I even had to go look at a YouTube video of the process to be certain that this was what they wanted you to do. It is! Also, don&#x27;t forget to put polish on the front edges of your nails, for a better seal. Otherwise, the layers have an occasional tendency to lift.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great machine, good quality construction, a great buy, and I am now a gel nail convert. My nails are looking better than they have in a long time, and I can just get on with my life, doing the things I normally do.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a year and I still love it!</li>
    <li> First, the good. The size is ideal--big enough for both feet/hands. Shipping was prompt. It dries my CND Shellac well (when all bulbs are functioning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the bad. It&#x27;s clearly a cheaply made machine--certainly not comparable to the machines used at salons (or the more expensive ones available on Amazon). Literally, during the second use, two of the three lights died. If I fidget with it, I can get two out of three to work, but it&#x27;s spotty. Even though it was inexpensive, I didn&#x27;t expect it to work so shoddily. It&#x27;s too large to return at this point, so I plan on looking for some replacement bulbs. Next time I&#x27;ll splurge on the CND machine.</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp and all the nail products so I could my nails at home and save money. It is a big investment but I am very pleased with how my nails and toes turned out. Easy to follow directions to install bulbs and lamp works great. I wish it had a 1 minute timer but I manage with the 2 minute. You don&#x27;t need to purchase a pricey lamp...this one does an awesome job.</li>
    <li> A must buy!!! I quit doing my nails years ago. Drying time to long for me with the gel system 30 minutes start to finish every 2-3 weeks I redue my nails.</li>
    <li> So for so good!  I haven&#x27;t put the lamp to much use yet.  I did receive the lamp within days and it was the item I was looking for.  Much thanks!</li>
    <li> Got the wrong light. But I keep it. It&#x27;s not bad product. I was doing my nail my selfs love it.</li>
    <li> The lamp is very well made.Not flimsy at all and has enough room so your fingers or toes are not crowded.A good value.</li>
    <li> I love this.  Small, light weight, but I still fit both hands at the same time.  Works great for pedicures too.  I will tell all my friends.</li>
    <li> I got this UV light so I could start doing Shellac manicures on my own, and came with easy to install batteries and has three buttons. a &amp;#34;continuous&amp;#34; &amp;#34;2 minutes&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;3 minutes&amp;#34;. I actually think that this is the same light that they use when I go to a salon and get my Shellac done. Best $52 ever spent. I&#x27;ve saved HUNDREDS in manicures. Never going back!</li>
    <li> I love how big this is, I can get both my feet underneath it at once. It took me some practice to get the no chip right but once I did its been wonderful. Definitely took several tries. Be patient and keep trying.</li>
    <li> My favorite product from amazon thus far.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make it through one set of nails.  I had just put the color on my second hand and the light went off and we couldn&#x27;t get it back on.  Couldn&#x27;t even complete one set of nails.  What a disappointment.  All the reviews said this was such a great product so I purchased it.  I returned it immediately and purchased the USpicy MACARON which worked great.  The lights on this one are poorly positioned, one is at the back so you have to make sure you don&#x27;t slide your hand in too far or you&#x27;ll smudge your nails.  Bad design, very disappointing</li>
    <li> It is exactly what my wife wanted. It&#x27;s the same as she used at the beauty salon, now she can do her own nails and save some money and time. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I have gone to several salons for Shellac manicures.  A couple were very good, but most were marginal.  Based on the amount of time and money I wasted, I decided to spring for this light and several Shellac products.  It was a good call.  If you can do your own nails WELL, then invest in this light.  I did a white and pink French manicure and am going on two weeks at the beach with no lift or trouble with my nails.  This light did the job.  The reason for the four stars is the bulbs were a bit difficult to get securely in place, and the directions did not give any guidance on this particular problem. In one purchase price of light and basic polish, you will almost be at the same cost as one or two manicures.  I will be doing the nails for my daughter-in-law&#x27;s wedding party with this system.</li>
    <li> This once was mine but my daughters have taken it over!  It works great. It is light and easy to set up.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews of this gel light nail dryer.  Some said theirs had a fan.  Mine did not.  I got the exact one pictured, and it works just fine. But if your hands get hot in these things, you might want to try another device.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great price! Works just as well as the machines in the nail salon. It&#x27;s big enough for you to fit both hands/feet for faster finish.</li>
    <li> This nail dryer is a professional item, it is a wonderful product and it works great.  As a licensed professional I would recommend that the purchaser follow the instructions to the tee.</li>
    <li> i bought the shellac system for my mother for christmas this light works perfectly. the polish is dry in the amount of time required and its fairly compact so that is nice also.</li>
    <li> Works perfect on my do at home gel manicure!! I use it with gelish products and it cures perfectly!  Great price for a fantastic product!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get my product and use it on my clients but come to find out it doesn&#x27;t contain the bulbs :( So, now I have to order them and wait even longer....</li>
    <li> This light dryer came fast. It works very well and dries my nails very quickly. I recommend this product to everyone</li>
    <li> I bought this to cure regular nail polish (not gel polish) with a uv top coat. I have acrylics and was tired of going to the salon so I bought this and some uv top coat. Love it, cures nails in 3 minutes. I did how ever buy the wrong uv top coat the first time and it did not work. Polish popped right off but after I got the right stuff it was fine. The lights are under neath the unit in the box so don&#x27;t miss them as several have said theirs did not come with them. Overall I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Awesome nail dryer. It really is big enough to fit your two hands or feet! Def a great buy and great price.</li>
    <li> It came on time..It works great and It has helped me in my business practices as well as keeping my own personal manicures looking salon worthy.</li>
    <li> Like that I can do nails at home. Large enough to fit my feet. Would like it to have option of one minute.</li>
    <li> Still works great after many months and applications.  One of the bulbs didn&#x27;t seem to work, but I just pushed it in hard and that fixed it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Bought another for my daughter. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Great product and saves so much time and money!  Im using it with lacquer base, polish and topcoat.  No difference from my $25 -1hr salon date.</li>
    <li> I&amp;#34;m delightful and my childrens too.</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp about 3 weeks ago. I only used it for two gel manicure sessions and when I tried to do my third today, I noticed one of the bulbs was burned out already. It didn&#x27;t even last a  month and now I have to look for the replacement bulb. Not happy.</li>
    <li> I cure each coat for three minutes because that is what they do at the salon and it lasts just as long! LOVE!... Much CHEAPER than getting your nails done very two weeks!</li>
    <li> This thing is the bomb! I have saved so much money with it, it dries my nails quickly &amp; is awesome.</li>
    <li> I have never used a light before every thing worked good, so I have nothing to compare the light with worked good</li>
    <li> Product is as depicted and works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for less than a year and it&#x27;s already breaking.  The issue is that all 3 bulbs won&#x27;t stay on at the same time.  I have to jiggle the bulb connection while it&#x27;s on, and hope that the other bulbs don&#x27;t go out.  I also have to leave it on continuous light, if I use the timer then the bulbs won&#x27;t come back on the next time I have to use the timer again.  Annoying!  Very disappointed!  Thought about returning it for a new one but the shipping charge was high so it&#x27;s not worth it.  Just more Made in China junk!</li>
    <li> I use this with the CND base and top coat shellac polish and they work perfectly. No problems yet with my light and the polish has lasted through so many pedicures.</li>
    <li> I have had this dryer for over 3 years. I haven&#x27;t used it much but when I do, it does a fairly good job. I got it back out today to do my 8 year old daughter&#x27;s nails and it is taking FOREVER to cure. So, I decided to order replacement lamps. To buy 3 replacement lamps, it will cost almost as much as buying a new nail dryer. I am going to try something else since I have probably only used this dryer 15-20 times and it already needs new bulbs.</li>
    <li> Great item. Quick shipping. A++++++</li>
    <li> Unfortunately upon arrival two of the three bulbs will not keep contact and will not stay on. Cheap junk. I don&#x27;t recommend at all. Very disappointed, now, I have to pay a lot to return it from central america to USA.&lt;br /&gt;Not recomended for international buyers.</li>
    <li> I bought this to be able to complete my own manicures when my manicurist was booked. I really seem to enjoy it.  This was the very first Black Friday item I had ever ordered.</li>
    <li> I bought this light to be able to do my own nails for shellac and save money. Needless to say, there are so many different polishes to buy and certain ways to apply the polish. Now I have a lamp with no use for it. Way too complicated for me to try and do as a professional. Consider just paying the money to have them done rather than waste the money like I did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Thermal Spa 49135 for six months now.  I use it with CND shellac base, color, and top coats.  Lighter more transparent colors seem to last a bit longer than dark opaque colors.  Beau and Hotski to Tchochke stayed chip free for an entire month while Asphalt, Purple Purple, Hot Pop Pink, Tropix, and Rosebud developed tiny chips as early as day 10 and usually need removed by day 14-21.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Large enough to fit two hands or feet.  The light cures each layer when used for the recommended times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  One of the three bulbs tended to flicker and go out although I was able to wedge a small metal pair of tweezers under a plastic support to get it to work.  I&#x27;m really hoping the replacement bulbs I&#x27;ve ordered will fit better.  I&#x27;ve seen the poor connections mentioned in other reviews.</li>
    <li> After a number of cruddy manicure lamps I am hopeful this one will last. So far, it works well - it drys all of my nails on both hands simultaniously.  My tootsies fit with plenty of room so as not to worry about bumping a nail. It is simple and quick. Worth the investment when one gel manipedi is $50.</li>
    <li> I have been using my lamp for about 6 months now and am very happy with it.  It is large enough to fit both of my feet and large enough to cure my entire hand (thumb included) without cramping.  I also have the sensational led lamp and prefer to use this despite the longer curing times.  I would definitely recommend this lamp for the at home manicurists.</li>
    <li> Received this product on September 11, 2012.  The SECOND time that I wanted to use it, (end of Sept.), the back, top bulb would not work!!  Contacted NORTHEAST BEAUTY, (who I went through for the purchase), and they told me, after several attempts of emails, I must contact Amazon directly, since they shipped it directly to me.  That procedure was a total run-around!!  They could not send a bulb or replacement.  Have to ship the ENTIRE light back to Amazon for a refund!!  This time I ordered from ebay.  Would rather deal with a company that stands bedhind its products in case of a problem!!  I really feel that if your lucky enough to get a light with no problems, this would be worth the money...</li>
    <li> I hardly ever write reviews unless something is really great or really terrible. This lamp is terrible. It did not work at all when I received it. I put the bulbs in and they didn&#x27;t work, turned them over and put them in again (thinking possible user error on my part) and they still didn&#x27;t work. I then read tips from other Amazon customers re:their lamps not working in the hope that I was just doing something dumb and installing the very easy to install light bulbs wrong. Nope. It&#x27;s just a cheap piece of crud that I am returning (sigh).</li>
    <li> My product did not come with lightbulbs and when I contacted customer service they said I had to return the whole product then reorder it.  Why would I do this, just to get another product w/out bulbs?  The sender should have sent the bulbs originally OR offered to send them after the fact.</li>
    <li> Decided to buy this nail dryer and do my nails myself. I use CND shellac that I buy thru Amazon. The dryer works like a charm. The polish lasts for 4 weeks. I would recommend this item to everyone.</li>
    <li> This dryer works well.  For the money, a good investment. I just hope I can get replacement bulbs without any problem. I will be checking for those soon...just in case.</li>
    <li> This Thermal Spa UV Gel Light Dryer worked well the first time I used it.  I would set it on 3 minute intervals in between sets and the UV light would turn on and off as scheduled.  I tried to use it for second time about two weeks later and the UV lamps would not turn on at all.  I unplugged it, I removed the bulbs and replaced them, I gave it time to chill, and it still did not turn on.  So, the next day I came back to try it again before I was ready to send it back, and it started working again!-- I have no idea what is going on, but I think it is just going to be one of those temperamental products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that my mother has the same machine (this is why i bought it) and she says that hers works just fine!--- So good luck with yours!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my step daughter so she would be able to do her nails at the house anytime she wanted to.  The machine works great with the larger wattage and appears to be solidly made.  She is enjoying how quick it dries her nails.</li>
    <li> This is EXACTLY like what they use in the best and busiest nail salons. Easy to put together and worked great! What a value! Will pay for itself in only 2 polishes! I highly recommend this if you want to do your own professional looking shellac manicures!</li>
    <li> I am using this for the second time. It has a timer for 2 min or 3 min. Its perfect for anyone, even professionals.</li>
    <li> I love this machine. My nails look beautiful, and so easy to use. And it saves me money and time.</li>
    <li> Not a good buy? Did not included  light bulbs. I have purchased one at a local beauty store and the light&lt;br /&gt;bulbs were already included. I ended up paying more ordering it here:/</li>
    <li> I have weak, thin nails and it is hard to grow my nails. I would usually splurge once in a great while and&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;get my nails done&#x27;, which meant acrylic tips. I would love them and admire them for about 1/2 day and then start tearing them off because my nails felt like they were suffocating. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started taking calcium supplements and my nails seemed to have strengthened some (they still can bend backwards due to softness) at least enough to grow a little and I started eyeing the shellac displays when I was at the salon. However, with this economy, even with working, I can not justify spending $40 a trip to get my &#x27;nails done&#x27;. So the next best thing was to research the supplies and see if I could do it at home....hence, here I am on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed easy enough and with another person&#x27;s review that spelled out &#x27;How To&#x27; do your nails, I decided to give it a go. I saved my dollars and bought the Thermal Spa and two bottles of CND, the top and base coats. I also bought the alcohol wipes and a big bottle of 100% Acetone. I cheated and used my own nail color polish I already had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me less than 1/2 hour to &#x27;do my nails&#x27; and it came out just like she said. After the 2 minutes under the light on the last round (top coat), I pulled out the alcohol wipe, quickly wiped my nails and the tacky part was GONE and wah lah, perfectly cured nails, perfectly SHINY cured nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a trip and I don&#x27;t mean to the salon either! LOL  LOVE this THERMAL Spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing, I did notice the TS comes with 3 light bulbs. I will be curious to see how long they last and how much they cost to replace. At this point, I am too happy with my shiny nails to really care!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/4/13 Update: Nails still shiny, no peeling or chipping. This is a record for me because usually by now, the nail polish is peeling off. Nails feel natural, no fake tip feeling and my they are so pretty! Yay for Shellac @ home! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This was the second lamp we order to replace the first one. The box as well as the ad on amazon states the bulbs would be 45 watts. When opening both packages, the lamp was sent with 18 watt replacement bulbs. Which were leaving the nails quit sticky at the end of the drying time.  Quit frustrating. Both lamps were sent back and waiting for a refund!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to do Shellac on my nails and have been very pleased. I haven&#x27;t had any problems. My mom had bought a much more expensive light, after seeing and using mine she regrets doing so. Can&#x27;t beat the price of this one compared to others. Already worth the money spent!!</li>
    <li> This has to be the worst item I&#x27;ve ever purchased from Amazon.  I plugged it in and the lights came on and I thought I was good to go.  I took off my nail polish and proceeded to shellac my nails.  I put the base coat on one hand and cured in the light.  I put on my first coat of shellac and cured it.  Then I put on my second coat of shellac and the light flashed at me and would NOT come on!  I unplugged the machine and took out the lights and reinstalled them.  The light does NOT work.  I had my nails almost half way done and no light that I had to have to cure my nails!  I was NOT happy.  I returned this and Amazon refunded my money.  I purchased the CND light off of Amazon and it was twice the price, but it works great!  I would NOT recommend the Thermal Spa 49135 light to anyone.</li>
    <li> easy to use and care for. Actually convenient enough size that I&#x27;ve brought it over to friend&#x27;s place to have a girls night!</li>
    <li> Stop working after a month of use. Never been dropped replaced bulbs... Tested wiring. no fire at all. Jusy stoppef working out the blue. But while it worked it dried nails quickly:-) :-) :-) :-) :-)&lt;br /&gt;Takes less than five minutes for two coat nails;great polish dryer for acrylic nails</li>
    <li> Just like most of the review, I found that this was very easy to use the first time I used it.  It worked perfectly!  I do need some practice with applying the polish - it&#x27;s a little different than regular polish which I became an expert at.  The main thing is - you really have to be careful not to get it on your skin/cuticle as it will peel off.  I plan to use this quite a bit, and save a lot of money in the process!!</li>
    <li> I would recommend the Thermal Spa to anyone who loves the look of gel nails but not the salon price.</li>
    <li> It makes doing my nails so easy.  It is light weight and is spacious enough for both hands.  I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> be careful to not put an acetone cotton ball on top of this</li>
    <li> I love being able to do my own gel nails, and have had a lot of fun w it over the past year and a half. From what I understand, uv rays are REQUIRED for shellac products. I originally purchased all shellac products but later found out that Gelish colors come in much larger bottles for less or equal price(more for my money). Gelish works just as well as shellac, and can be cured w LED or UV  light.&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the lamp itself.. It works but.. its rather large and not made of overly high quality plastic. There are 3 lights inside but my lap struggles to hold them in place and I end up w a strobing effect. When they burn out the lights are $15 ish each to replace... $45 dollars later I should have just bought a new lamp. I used my lamp roughly once a week (on myself/friends/family)for the past year and a half and the bulbs all needed replaced. From now on I&#x27;m going to stick w gelish and try an LED. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> My favorite sog off gel brand is CND Shellac, but this UV light can be used for all other brands.  You just have to adjust the timing as needed by brand (i.e. OPI Gel Color- 3 minutes).  From the other reviews I was expecting it to be bigger.  But it&#x27;s lightweight and appropriately sized for the job.  Be sure to look underneath the unit when you unpack because the bulbs are in a false bottom.  They also need to be seated properly in the bulb fixture inside.  Take your time and fit them in securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cuts down my time by half because I can fit both hands and alternatively both feet in the unit.  Considering the time savings and the fact that I can use this for all my gel products, this was the most logical, budget minded choice.  Easily cures my soak off gel.  The timers work well.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice product,  good size not too small and not too big.  Works well and have options for power saving. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This works great!  I love the Gel nails and this light works wonderfully.  I got it quickly which was even better.  Great price!</li>
    <li> It has worked well for me and I have had it about 10 months now.  I don&#x27;t usually put more than one hand in at a time but I can spread my hand out inside.  By the time I am done with both hands and all the layers it is a bit warm because of not having a fan inside but it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Came before expected date. After reading the reviews, i was kinda scared but all turned out okay and works great, just takes longer dry.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but my daughter in law has had one for a couple years and it&#x27;s great</li>
