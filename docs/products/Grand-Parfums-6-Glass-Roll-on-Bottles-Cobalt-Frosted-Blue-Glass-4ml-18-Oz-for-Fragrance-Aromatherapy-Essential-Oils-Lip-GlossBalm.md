    <li> I purchased these to make some concoctions with my essential oils.  Lets just say they are a pain to use. Out of 6 only 2 were able to fit the roller ball in easily. I also used the tips they give with the instructions but no dice.  Find another product, I know I sure will!</li>
    <li> glass vials were exactly what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> The roller balls fall out EVERY TIME I USE THEM.  It&#x27;s making me insane.  I use these bottles for essential oil blends, and what ends up happening is that the oils just seep out all over my purse.  The good news is, my purse now smells fabulous.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my samples of EO.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using them for essential oils and I was looking for a small size and cute looking bottles , the roll on works great and they fit perfectly I only give it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t use them enough to see if the blue coat lasts</li>
