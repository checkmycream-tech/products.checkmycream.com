      <li>This is not the most solid of commodes</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got this for my mother ans she said she liked it. she is not a very small woman so I guess it is sturdy.</li>
    <li> My dad used this every day.  He was very unsteady and this is super sturdy.  We also bought the Glad liners and they made it very easy to keep this clean.  Thank you for this great quality product.</li>
    <li> This new design hasn&#x27;t been made with a handicapped person in mind. The seat itself is way to long and the entire seat comes up when you get off of it. The old seat was square on the front and didn&#x27;t stick out in front. Much better design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seat is also flimsy and moves to easily from side to side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dark grey color makes it very difficult to see if the caregiver is getting the tub clean.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality equipment and the price is very reasonable. I am happy with the purchase. I wished I ordered it earlier.</li>
    <li> One of the drawbacks of buying toilet/bathroom/commode equipment is that as a health condition changes/improves the owner may end up with unused, bulky gear around the house. That&#x27;s why versatility and multi-use functionality can be a help. This commode is that kind of useful equipment. It can provide a commode for someone who can&#x27;t make it to the bathroom.  It can also make toilet use safer, by providing either a metal frame around the existing toilet seat, or by adding an elevated seat. This means that as a person&#x27;s mobility increases or decreases, this piece of equipment can adapt. Can help with the budget and when limited space is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended especially when mobility restrictions change from time to time.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Sturdy and well made. Well priced and a life saver post- surgery. Would recommend to anyone and perfect for elderly parents visiting.</li>
    <li> I purchase this commode for my mom . Her leg was amputated . this commode was sturdy enough for my mom to transfer from her self from her bed ,to the commode and hold her up .This commode can take some weight just adjust the legs.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Thanks for the fast service, product was/is as I thought it would be. What else can one say?  Works as good as you want...</li>
    <li> Product is wonderful and was shipped fast</li>
    <li> I had hip replacement, and this works very good. Glad I bought it</li>
    <li> This is not the most solid of commodes but you get what you pay for. We use it over the toilet for added height but the seat cover is always snapping off. It is easy enough to put back on but definately a nuisance.Think twice before buying this one as there are better ones available</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and it has been such a blessing for her.  The commode is sturdy and does the job it is designed to do with safety for the patient.  Very pleased with the purchase!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT THAT I RECOMMEND, EASY SET UP, STURDY, HIGH QUALITY AND REASONABLE PRICE.  CAME IN HANDY WITH MY BROKEN LEG.</li>
    <li> Disappointed they no longer carried the white commode, it is much more obvious in a white bathroom and does nothing for the decor, however it is sturdy and does the job.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the thin plastic lid cover which doesn&#x27;t conceal odors as well as my other Invacare commode that needed replacing. Also, there are times that a special needs person needs to sit down on the seat which I could do on the discarded commode Another factor is the toilet seat keeps pinching my butt and thighs which is quite painful. Thus, I ordered the Toilet Bowl liners thinking that might solve the pinching problem but that didn&#x27;t solve the problem. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this commode.</li>
    <li> The seat is comfortable.  The pot needs to be all one piece.</li>
    <li> My niece, an occupational therapist, recommended this type for after my hip replacement surgery. So even though the product paperwork said not to use it over the standard toilet, we removed the under basin and placed it over our standard toilet and it worked great so I didn&#x27;t break the 90-degree angle rule. After my husband&#x27;s back surgery, he tried the other types that sit on top of the toilet seat but he felt unstable. This is much better and the price was great.</li>
    <li> It was shipped promptly, did not require assembly and is very sturdy. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to and I&#x27;m very happy with that!</li>
    <li> This chair does not offer much in the way of aesthetics, but it is 100% perfect for my wife&#x27;s purposes after knee replacement surgery.  We just toss away the \\&quot;bucket\\&quot; and we&#x27;re ready to go.  Best price I could find on line too!!</li>
    <li> This is a lot better than the one we had before, very well made and lightweight makes it easy to move around. Its also very sturdy.</li>
    <li> So easy to adjust the height.  Sturdy and makes me feel safe.  Looks nicer than the white hospital look.  Makes life easier for me since my hip replacement, because it reduces the pain of sitting down and standing up again.  Nice.</li>
    <li> German made. It fits together-which is nice. Some cheapo ones seem to split the seat-the problem being the stress of the plastic&lt;br /&gt;with a heavy person. And I have one in my shed that I tried replacing the seat, but the snap-in of the Chinese version also split. It adjusts easily.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my dad who is a pretty big guy and it is working out great! Next to bed.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have my bedside commode. Having MS has made it challenging to make it to the bathroom at night and the bedside commode has made things much easier for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Sharyn Volk</li>
    <li> This chair is an exceptional unit very durable and easy to set up. But the best of all was the price.</li>
    <li> Nice sturdy commode that is easy to assemble and move.  Only one gripe is the seat back fits on very loose and pops off all the time sot the disable person I take care of has her back resting on the metal bar - not the seat back.  I may try to modify the back so it is not removable.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty and adjustable. Sturdy and well balanced.</li>
    <li> Medical Department  Store (vendor) shipped one different from what&#x27;s posted on Amazon.com (which was verified by MDS prior by email and phone). I went through the proper channel - through Amazon to request return (for exchange) which was authorized. In the meanwhile, tried sit on the seat on its frame (not over toilet) and find it acceptable (though not as wide as the one ordered). However, the seat lid does not stay on. Contacted MDS to inform them of my decision an to stop the return process. MDS customer service told me that I &amp;#34;should not have gone through Amazon and that they will handle this directly.&amp;#34; It was not very pleasant experience. The rep. (Mark) argued with me about the product that I received was the &amp;#34;right one&amp;#34; even though I told him that I decided to keep it. He was very defensive and did not listen to what the customer was saying. He said that the lid is of inferior quality because it&#x27;s now made in Taiwan (come on, who provided the specs?)...  I was to receive a replacement lid. 2 weeks later, when I called to check on the status, unfortunately, Mark answered. He unwillingly told me he would check into it and call me in the afternoon. I had to call the next day. I got Mark AGAIN. His excuse was &amp;#34;they didn&#x27;t get back to me..&amp;#34; As he was &amp;#34;checking&amp;#34; (I suppose reading the notes on file), he mentioned again, &amp;#34;You received the right product&amp;#34;which really frustrated me. I told me to &amp;#34;forget that&amp;#34;. He then hung up on me. In the meanwhile, I am still not getting the replacement lid !!</li>
    <li> Does the job or which it was intended. Very stable and easy to move.&lt;br /&gt; Easy to clean and  care for.</li>
    <li> My parents use this as a shower seat and think it works very well.</li>
    <li> Disappointed as the seat keeps slipping&lt;br /&gt;Have had good products in past&lt;br /&gt;Please do not try to cut corners to the&lt;br /&gt;Expense of your product</li>
    <li> this has the smallest seat cut out ever! if you are a male its impossible to sit down and go number 1 you will end up going on the floor. its nice and sturdy and came already assembled and you can adjust the legs to fit over your toilet but like i said it only works for women or going number 2. i like that it came pre assembled but we end up not using it because my dad couldnt use it.</li>
    <li> I made a mistake ordered this. I had bought one from NOVA, it was great. I meant to order another one to use downstairs when My mother got back from hospital from hip surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packing was not great and the back piece is not design right ( came off all the time as other reviewer stated).  The material is not quite as fine as NOVA, there is no splash guard , however, I find that a pro since the guard makes it harder to clean, it accumulate urine residual, and there is not handle to carry ( the bucket).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cost that much and I did not return it because of the trouble of sending it back. Compare with the local medical supply it is still reasonable buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 90 year old mom and to replace an older one that was rusting. This an excellant sturdy design with a wider seat that does not slide or wobble when used. My mom likes it much better than the previous one. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful if your wife falls on the ice, compound fracturing her leg, requiring pins, plates and screws and is unable to get up the stairs to the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I already had one but I gave this one as a gift.  Someone whose bathroom of the house and she had difficult for her.</li>
    <li> A very strong and sturdy chair. It arrived preassembled which saved time &amp; effort and got it into service right away. Works great with optional removable liners, a highly recommended add-on purchase.  The seat is wide and comfortable and it accommodates greater weight than many of its competitors. Glad I got it as it already saved the day more than once!</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured and expected.  It works well and is just what we needed.</li>
    <li> A great piece of medical durable equipment, the price being only $26.00 plus tax &amp; shipping, still stays under $35.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in one piece, no assembly of any kind, for anyone elderly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A total winner, i.e price, durability, and ease of use.</li>
    <li> Very well made and shipped quickly.  We are pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The seat and cover are okay, the overall metal frame is sturdy.  But, the metal frame that holds the pot is flimsy and the pot is a thin flexible plastic that will do the job but I prefer a thicker diameter.</li>
    <li> Just Okay and needs tweeking.....  I wish I had the time to rework mom&#x27;s old one as it was much better quality although this was a decent value.  I felt I had to do a little extra engineering and add parts to ensure the bucket was in the proper place and would stay there.</li>
    <li> exactly as it was ordered, very nice</li>

    <li> I use it both in the bedroom and bathroom I lost my leg in 2006 and very hard at night to go to restroom this works very well</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> Great bedside commode. Sturdy construction</li>
    <li> Very Happy With It.  Love the Gray!</li>
    <li> I got this commode chair for my dad who was having trouble getting to the toilet in the middle of the night.  I put it next to his bed at night and it has really helped! The commode itself is exceptionally well made.  It came completely assembled, is nice looking, considering what it is, and is very stable, sturdy, and smoothly made.  The lid closes tightly enough that even when it has been used and there is fecal matter or urine in the hopper, there is no odor. The hopper is very generously sized and is made of a smooth thick plastic that is easy to rinse clean.  The side arms are quite sturdy.  My father depends on them to get himself up and out of bed in the night.  Even though the construction is so sturdy, it is still not overly heavy.  I find it very easy to move each morning when I put it away.  It was an excellent purchase for the price, and would have been even at twice this.</li>
