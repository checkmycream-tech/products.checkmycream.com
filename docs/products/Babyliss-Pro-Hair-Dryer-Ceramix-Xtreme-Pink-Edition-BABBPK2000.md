      <li>Also, I love how long the cord is.</li>
      <li>Well i first wrote this product was AMAZING, until having it for a few months.  </li>
      <li>which sure beats the 4 hours it takes to air dry it.</li>
      <li>I have only ever used cheap ~ $20-ish hair dryers but decided to invest in something nicer at the suggestion of my hair stylist.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It works great, is a little bit heavy but has good power, it heated very well. I am happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this blow dryer!!!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is great. It is so much better than the cheap 25 dollars hair dryers I used to get from the store. No frizz (and I live in Florida where we have tons of humidity) and it dries my hair in half the time. The cord is not retractable, but that is my only quirk with the dryer. If you are looking to step up and not pay 100 dollars for a hairdryer this one is awesome. I&#x27;m truly impressed.</li>
    <li> So far, so good!  Much better than my previous Hot Tools that blew up.  It is heavier, but dries my hair faster and with less tangles.</li>
    <li> Does a great job on my curly hair. Much faster and it makes it nice and smooth. It is just a little heavy but I would buy again</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer ever.  Need I say more?</li>
    <li> Very powerful hairdryer.  The wife and daughter seem to like it.  A little pricey but good quality.</li>
    <li> I love the color, the problem I have is the weight. It is so heavy. I have a lot of hair and it takes forever to blow dry and this hair dryer makes it difficult.</li>
    <li> Best blowdryer I have ever owned. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Great dryer, just a little heavy and...the buttons are very flat, making it hard to slide on and off.</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer for my getting my wavy hair smooth.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is better than the ones you can buy at Target or Wal-Mart. My old hairdryer died and I replaced it with a Revlon model, but I soon learned that it only had one heat setting, which was very hot. It cost about $10 less than this hairdryer and was a total waste of money. I decided to go ahead and order this model and I&#x27;m glad I did. It dries fast even on the warm setting, which is great for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, which other people actually said was a nice feature, is the buttons. They are smooth and flat and I find it impossible to move them when drying wet hair. When my fingers are wet, I can&#x27;t get a grip on the buttons, so I have to set the hairdryer down on the counter and use both hands to change the heat setting or turn it on and off.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is perfect! Recommended to me by my hair stylist after she used it on my hair, and I immediately purchased right after my hair appointment! Dries my hair fast, allows you to change the speed and temperature, and also features a &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button! Plus it comes with the awesome add on to attach to the end and direct air flow! Came fast and exactly as described! Plus the pink is super cute, it is a lighter pink than pictured than...but you won&#x27;t be disappointed! :)</li>
    <li> I really like this dryer.  My daughter and I both have long thick hair, and it dries it in about 2-3 mins.  I also love that the control buttons are flush with the handle, so I&#x27;m not turning it off by mistake.  I&#x27;m deducting one star only because it&#x27;s slightly heavy.  I would recommend this for sure.</li>
    <li> Love my new baby! Great hair dryer at an affordable price. I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer. It dries my hair quickly &amp; thoroughly, even though just a little heavy. Excellent product &amp; highly recommended</li>
    <li> My wife said this dryer is like a windstorm in the bathroom. It dried her hair so she is happy, which means I am happy.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good hairdryer, antifrizz, i have long thick hair and it takes me almost an hour to style my hair. With this hair dryer i did it in 20 min! and the results a shiny, antifrizz hair. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this hairdryer. I can dry my thick hair in 5 minutes and friends keep commenting on how great my hair looks.</li>
    <li> Best hairdryer I have ever used!  Buy it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife (lots of hair) claims it saves her 20+ min post shower in the morning!</li>
    <li> This is the best quality hair dryer I&#x27;ve every owned!</li>
    <li> The most powerful hair dryer which I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned!! It has so many settings you could never burn your hair unless you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, which seems impossible!! I can dry my hair in half the time it&#x27;s so strong!! That&#x27;s the biggest deal for me!! Plus, it has 3 settings for how strong to blow dry, 3 settings for how hot and cool, plus the cool button!! Definitely spend the money on this, it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
    <li> The best hair dryer ever!</li>
    <li> It is a great blow dryer for the price</li>
    <li> Nice quality blow dryer. It does have a lot of power, sometimes too much- my bangs can get out of control! Does a good job and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer exceeded my expectations! I have only ever used cheap ~ $20-ish hair dryers but decided to invest in something nicer at the suggestion of my hair stylist. It has made SUCH a difference! High quality machine at a very good price.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product - worth every penny!  I&#x27;d follow this brand, absolutely!  Good shipping as well.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well. Dried my hair in a third of the time it takes with my old hair dryer. I recommend you spend an extra 20 bucks and buy this hair dryer instead of buying a cheap brand. It&#x27;s a great deal!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome hair dryer.  Definitely professional quality.  It takes less time to dry my hair now.  Also, I love how long the cord is.</li>
    <li> This Review is for the MEN ONLY. So I, the husband, bought this for my wife because she wanted something more powerful than 1850 watts. So this was her Christmas Gift. Her old hair dryer took 20 minutes to dry her hair and made it really frizzy (con-air brand). She timed her drying with this BABBPK2000 Xtreme Pink Edition and it took only.....wait for it.........5 minutes and her hair was shiny with no frizz. She HONESTLY WONT SHUT UP ABOUT IT. After she dries her hair she keeps telling me to look at it and see how there isn&#x27;t any fuzz or frizz or whatever woman&#x27;s hair gets like. HEY FELLAS, IF YOUR WIFE, GIRLFRIEND OR WHATEVER NEEDS A NEW HAIR DRYER THEN GO WITH THIS ONE. HAPPY WIFE/GIRLFRIEND HAPPY LIFE. Trust me guys She will be happy AND she will be ready faster, 15 minutes faster. So you wont have to yell at her to hurry up and then she gets mad and takes longer. lol.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer. Went on vacation and did not take it. Missed it a lot!!!</li>
    <li> so far no problems with it just a bit heavier but nothing else...</li>
    <li> I always used salon hair dryer, compare to that this is only 4 star</li>
    <li> I have long wavy/curly hair and I&#x27;ve never owned a hair dryer. I always thought air drying was best for the health of my hair but lately my hair has gotten so gross and messy and frizzy that I almost considered giving myself a hair cut and just chopping off everything off a few times. I did start using a cleanser once a week and that helped somewhat but my hair was still just horrible. So instead of doing something drastic I decided to give blow drying a chance. I bought the Babyliss 3 in 1 diffuser with it so I&#x27;ve only ever used the two together. Before I get into the results, my first two thoughts when opening the box was that 1. The black is a beautiful deep matte color and the pink is a lot nicer on the product then in the picture and 2. It&#x27;s a lot lighter than I expected. Everybody complained about how heavy it was. Again, I&#x27;ve never owned a hair dryer so maybe they&#x27;re normally a lot lighter then this one. But from me, no complaints!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to the results... My hair is absolutely amazing now. Sometimes I&#x27;ll just look at my hair in the mirror or even when a perfect curl falls on my shoulder and I&#x27;m just so happy. It&#x27;s like it was styled and curled for hours to get it to look like that. It takes about 20 minutes to dry it completely and style it which sure beats the 4 hours it takes to air dry it. I put in some before products, lots of mousse and some gel and get to scrunching and by the end my hair is so full of volume and curls! And the best part is that my hair is still perfect for the next two days. Sometimes I&#x27;ll rewet my hair and diffuse it for about 5 minutes to add more curl to it but then I&#x27;m good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used the blow dryer to straighten my hair yet but if and when I do I&#x27;ll review that. But for now I&#x27;m loving my curls!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hairdryer. It looks like I came out of salon everytime.</li>
    <li> I love the weight and the grippy feeling of the appliance. The &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting still blows my hair around like crazy, but I think my hair is softer and less frizzy with this hair dryer. Overall - great!</li>
    <li> good blow dryer but a bit heavy</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is amazing- I just ordered another one for my daughter- She has super thick long hair and doesn&#x27;t like to dry her hair because it takes too long- We just tested this hair dryer and literally her hair was dry within 10 minutes- Great product!</li>
    <li> Not as loud as other hair dryers, and has plenty of power. I don&#x27;t feel that it gets as hot as some of my other hair dryers, but that&#x27;s probably not a bad thing because i don&#x27;t over dry my hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  It arrively very quickly.  Excellent price for this hair dryer.  My hairstylist recommended this brand and I was surprised at how reasonable the price was!</li>
    <li> wife loves it and says its better the 1&#x27;s that are more expensive,i don&#x27;t have hair I wouldn&#x27;t know :)</li>
    <li> It is very strong, but little heavy.</li>
    <li> Excellent Hair dryer - powerful blower with max heat....</li>
    <li> does its job. love the cool sitting and the feel of it.</li>
    <li> Hair dryer broke 4 months later. I tried to email sender 2 times and never heard back about replacing this dryer.</li>
    <li> Well i first wrote this product was AMAZING, until having it for a few months.  This hairdryer keeps on shutting off !!! Soooo annoying!  Prob not even real BaByliss</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only dryer that I will use! Love it!</li>
