<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No better than anything else</li>
    <li> Not the results I was looking for</li>
    <li> 2nd order..  this stuff works and tightness noticed it right away..  down side is the bottle is hard to use, they should try a pump and put more in it..  it doesn&#x27;t last long per order...</li>
    <li> I love love love this serum! A little goes a really long way. I have now used it for a few weeks and I can see the changes in the skin around my eye. It&#x27;s tighter and much softer. Customer for life here!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work for me...I have used the product for three months and I still have dark circles.</li>
    <li> I bought a popular eye gel on Amazon about 2 weeks ago and loved it after the first use. But it is a gel and not very moisturizing so I thought I&#x27;d try one that boasts the same results but in cream form. It was my intent to use the cream at night and the gel in the morning. Well, this product, MezmerEyes, did NOT reduce the puffy bags or puffy eye lids which is my major issue or complaint. In fact, I almost looked worse. Before you ask, yes I did follow the directions that came in the email Protege sent me. I IMMEDIATELY went back to the first product I bought. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll keep this eye cream. I&#x27;m on the fence about it. I may give it a few more tries before sending it back....</li>
    <li> can only use for short times than eye tissue starts to burn</li>
    <li> Very hard to open it, finally was opened in wrong way (at bottom ).</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the results this product gives me and surprised.  I must have been born with dark circles under my eyes. I have no memory of not having them. I did not expect a miracle but pretty much got it with this product.  I am more than pleased-I am overjoyed.</li>
    <li> Horrible did not help at all with my puffy eyes I want my money back!</li>
    <li> Its hard to remember to use twice a day . I have a job where I am on call and often get home very late or not till the next day. I think it is making a difference even just using it once a day</li>
    <li> Been using a while &amp; don&#x27;t see any difference&lt;br /&gt;I suppose too old @ 65  for improvement!</li>
    <li> Great cream for puffy eyes and anti anging&lt;br /&gt;Will order more soon....</li>
    <li> Been using this for 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change!!!!  Maybe by the end of another couple weeks but definately disappointed!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst eye cream I have ever come across my life. Buyer beware. The chemical elements of this eye team damaged the areas around my eyes after using it for 20 days. It was a nightmare! The ingredients are too strong. The area around my eyes reddened, flared up and started peeling. Im still reeling from the after effects of this product even after 3 months. I had to see a dermatologist to bring back my face to its original condition. Will never recommend this to anyone who has sensitive skin. I am hoping the manufacturer will refund my money. Haven&#x27;t spoken to them yet !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a moisturizing cream but I haven&#x27;t seen any positive impact on my dark circles. I also notice that it would cake out when I use  sunscreen or make-up afterwards.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me as I ran out of my trusted eye creams. Used it for at least a month and was not satisfied. I usually use Philosophy Eye Hope or Clinique Anti-gravity cream. I wanted to try something new and this was reasonably priced with good reviews. It goes on smoothly, that&#x27;s the only plus. It does not feel like it moisturizes your skin at all and looks HORRIBLE under makeup, it flakes. I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have no wrinkles, just to give you an idea. Once I stopped using this product my makeup looked good again. Will stick with my favorite store bought eye reams from now on.</li>
    <li> So far I have not noticed any improvements at all. If anything I can actually feel the bags under my eyes more and my eyes feel more tired. This could also be caused by &amp;#34;Winter&amp;#34; here in Central Florida. I plan on updating my review in a week or so, that is if I don&#x27;t give up and ask for a refund. My biggest concern is why does this eye cream contain Sorbitol? So a quick search answered that question for me..... &amp;#34;It is also used as a thickener and moisturizer in beauty products.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m still not thrilled considering Sorbitol is also a laxative. The more I think about this the more it bothers me. By the way, I am a man trying out this product because hey, nobody likes dark circles or bags under their eyes.</li>
    <li> Second purchase &amp; very satisfied. I had been using a product at over double the cost &amp; decided to try this one for the promises of reducing bags, darkness &amp; lines. It works! Read the ingredients &amp; it all makes sense.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my puffy eyes and I used it for over six months. Wasted a lot of time on a product that gave me no results.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for a discount from the seller in exchange for my honest opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite DAYTIME eye creams are those that contain caffeine! I love to use them right away in the am so they help with my puffiness. It is really hard to find a good cream at a good PRICE that contains caffeine. MezmerEYES did it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has a nice slip to it so it feels really nice under makeup. It doesn&#x27;t drag or catch your delicate undereye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients include Jojoba Seed Oil, Squalane (Olive Oil), Hydrolyzed Collagen, Sesame Seed Oil, Sweet Almond Seed Oil, Avocado Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Aloe Vera Leaf Extract, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide, Licorice Extract, Retinyl Acetate(Vitamin A), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Caffeine, Tocotrienols and Alpha-D-Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Epigallocatechin Gallate (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Cucumber Extract. Base Ingredients: Distilled Water, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitol, Butylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, C14-22 Alcohols, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Stearyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is white and thick.  No smell either. You only need  dab to do both eyes. Just give it about 5 minutes to sink in and do its magic! For a tired mom.. its perfect!</li>
    <li> sorry but it is dry if feels creamy going on but then feels dry .</li>
    <li> Did nothing for bags under the eye but in fairness - they did refund as promised without hesitation because I was not 100% satisfied so I consider it a no risk purchase.</li>
    <li> After using Embellash by Protégé, and having fabulous results with new eye lash growth, the company offered a wonderful promotion to try their Mezmereyes eye crème.  I have been so happy with these products!!!!  It is so reassuring trying new products and having such  GREAT results!!!</li>
    <li> Every time I put this on, I started looking like I did not sleep for the past few nights. Probably because how these products work to help with the dark circles and also bags at the same time. I wonder if there is something in it to reduce the bags, it would help somebody who has bags but otherwise, it might suck the hydration out of that area and my eyes ended up looking deep set. It did nothing to the darkness and it is just not a nice consistency to use. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice a change with your product I am sorry to say.  I am 55 years old. Maybe that is the problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always searching for products to improve the appearance of my skin. I have recently been having an issue with puffiness around my eyes, so I was excited to receive and try out this product, as it says it helps reduce puffiness!! After trying this Protege Anti Aging Eye Cream out for myself I have seen a noticeable difference in the appearance of my skin and my eye puffiness faded away and is now gone!! I found this to be an all around great anti aging eye cream not only does this product by Protege reduce the appearance of puffiness but it also brightens, firms and smooths the region around your eyes!! It also diminishes dark circles and fine lines, tightens skin and it&#x27;s clinically proven ingredients Collagen and Hyaluronic Acid enhance your skins elasticity and reduces wrinkles!! This Protege Anti Aging eye cream is packed with amazing benefits for your skin and I definitely recommend this Protege Anti Aging Eye Cream to everyone!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched all over for the right eye cream. I just purchased this and already feeling good about this product</li>
    <li> waste of money...did not work. used as directions indicated.</li>
    <li> MezmerEYES  was delivered promptly and in excellent shape&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MezmerEYES is is the most incredible eye cream I&#x27;ve tried so far, for creating some very POWERFUL results. MezmerEYES is the first LONG TERM success I&#x27;ve had at treating fine lines; I can see that true HEALING is taking effect! Other products I&#x27;ve tried that simulated the same fine line results did so instantly, BUT lasted for only a few hours, then those fine lines were right back EVERY TIME! High Priced products with fancy names were NOT healing my fine lines, they were like irritating my eyelids &amp; making them puff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MezmerEYES started producing noticable results that have STAYED and continually INCREASED by the 3rd week, even causing people to comment . Fine lines CONTINUE to disappear, along with MANY other eye wrinkles, dark circles, etc., which are continuing to improve, as well... it&#x27;s a BIG job but I feel like this product can do it!&lt;br /&gt;THANKS for making MezmerEYES!&lt;br /&gt;ElCid</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see any results used it for almost 3 month, but nothing seems to help</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised with the results so far.  It does as it claim as I&#x27;ve been noticing the difference after a few weeks of using it.  I like the fact that the cream isn&#x27;t heavy or oily, but has a very nice soft texture to it and absorbs quickly.  I always avoid all the fluff from product claims so I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much but its worked out quite fine so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alicia Tan</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an anti-aging eye cream, so I was a bit skeptical, but I&#x27;ve been using this cream twice a day for a few weeks and I have noticed the puffiness under my eyes getting much smaller and my eye area is brighter. I also received emails from Protégé asking if I had any questions, which was nice. I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> its okay, i didn&#x27;t really notice any changes with my eye drops , it made a nice moisturizer but did not see a huge decrease in my puffy eyes and I used the whole bottle</li>
    <li> I m  impressed with this product that has given me the brightness I have been looking for. It only takes a small amount underneath your eyes spread out to the corner. I do love it I would order it again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;HN</li>
    <li> Not sure if it is working really well but easy to apply regardless.</li>
    <li> I live in a dry part of the country, and it dries my skin to the point that it starts to hurt. Since I&#x27;ve started using this product, my skin feels nice and smooth, and soothes it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would help get rid of my dark under eye circles. It feels good after applying and keeps the skin around my eyes hydrated, but the dark circles are still there</li>
    <li> works fine.. almost out</li>
    <li> great value and a great product. I have tried to use eye creams for many years and never found one that worked well for me until now. I have a great deal of scar tissue on my upper lids and crepe undereye lids from all the swelling. I had an accident over 20 years ago and since have had over 30 corrective surgeries causing lots of swelling and ultimately stretching the skin under and over my eyes. I am 43, caucasion and female. After trying many creams that caused more swelling and didn&#x27;t offer moisture to the skin around my eyes I gave up. I decided to try again and did some ressearch and foung this cream. No swelling, no irritation and fabulous results and I&#x27;m only in 2 weeks with this.&lt;br /&gt;I got my first compliments today when a friend asked me what I was doing different because my eyes looked bright and allert. I also started using a skin serum on the rest of my face at the same time and that too has made a HUGE difference. She was so impressed with how youthful my eyes and skin look that she stated I look 10 years younger and she met me 10 years ago so she would know.&lt;br /&gt;I kept it to myself about my new facial program and waited to hear if anyone noticed without prompting. Here I am two weeks later and BOY did they notice! I couldn&#x27;t wait to whip out my eye cream and facial serum to show her what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for great results and was expecting to wait at least a month if not longer before anyone noticed but BLAM! two weeks in and I was showered with compliments!  WOO HOO!&lt;br /&gt;To top it off, I had a late night last night and several glasses of wine that wore me out, I was in great need of a nap and STILL my friend noticed the improvement, if that&#x27;s not a testiment to the effecacy of this product, nothing is.</li>
    <li> Being a business owner and working in the customer service field, I take reviews extremely seriously.  I have to use a product several weeks before giving a fair evaluation.  It’s important not only to see how it performs at the beginning but if it consistently shows improvement over time.  This product is top notch, is quick at showing results but also continues to provide rejuvenating results even after your skin is used to the product. Just today, I had someone tell me I looked years younger than my age. My fine lines have almost disappeared, there is a brightness to my eye and I just love the smooth texture when putting it on. This eye cream is awesome and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This feels wonderful on, and seems to work very well.  Not irritating to me. Note:  This bottle has a pump on top.  It is an air pump and does not require a tube.  You do have to pump it a while at first, but it does dispense after that.  Magic.</li>
    <li> I received my eye cream and have been using it for about a week. I have to say I really like this cream. It goes on smoothly and I have noticed a difference in the area under my eyes. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used it on my eyes and saw no results. it makes you skin feel warm and uncomfortable do not buy!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! I could feel it tightening my under eyes. I feel much better and confident in my skin. Although I may need to keep using it to see long lasting and continuous result over time, but even then, I could already tell after finishing a bottle that it was a great product.</li>
    <li> I used the product as directed and saw little results for about two weeks. Then I started to see some difference, just as the canister went empty. REALLY ! I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product and received it within 3 days.  Overall I am very happy with my purchase and the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of eye creams. This one&#x27;s my favorite. Fine texture, doesn&#x27;t make a mess of makeup, keeps skin moist, seems (after abt two weeks of use) to be living up to its sales pitch. One thing: you need less than a pea-size dollop for both eyes, especially if you used over a serum.</li>
    <li> This was the first eye cream I have used that actually resulted in a big reduction in puffy eyes.  I have also noticed much reduced dark circles.  I figure there is no magic cure for getting older and what that means for the area around our eyes, but this product has actually made me look younger.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my bags under my eyes or puffiness.  I have had this problem for eleven years (since I had my twins). I have tried 3 other Amazon eye creams, roller applicators, and even a cream my doctor recommended.  Nothing has worked.  The eye creams I purchased from Amazon recommended using the cream 2x/ day for about 3 weeks to see results!  This Protege Eye Cream worked the first time I tried it , just about an hour after I applied it.  I haven&#x27;t used it before bedtime, but every morning so far, apply the cream…eyes start looking good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy to finally find an eye cream that works!</li>
    <li> This irritated my eyes and gave me a bad headache every time I tried to use it. I normally don&#x27;t ever get headaches so maybe I have an allergy to something in this product.</li>
    <li> Ive never written a review on Amazon before, but thought it was worth sharing for this product. This is an eye gel or balm, not a cream, first off. Secondly, after I applied it under my eyes and put on my concealer, it had a strange effect and began crumbling/flaking off. With and without the concealer, it did this as soon as it dried. So i&#x27;d say that if you intend to use this balm under your make-up, then it&#x27;s not the right product for you. Perhaps it&#x27;d be better suited as a night-time cream so that people only apply it after they&#x27;ve washed off their make-up before bed.</li>
    <li> Mild and gentle on the eye results slow but satisfactory</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this stuff.  The cream is gentle and moisturizing, and has softened the skin beneath my eyes.  However after 6 weeks of use I saw no improvement in the bags.  What worked for the bags was a tightening gel, which I will review elsewhere.  So I use this cream now at night, and the tightener during the day.&lt;br /&gt;One problem I have had is with the pump - it only works intermittently, and when it does it squirts out too much.  I&#x27;ve learned that I pump it into my palm to catch it all, use what I need, and put the remainder in a small glob under the nozzle for use next time.&lt;br /&gt;I doubt I will purchase again when it is gone.</li>
    <li> This product is not as described.  It is sticky and uncomfortable on face.  I would return it, but I missed my return deadline.  In fact all the products I purchased in this line feel inferior and work poorly with my existing products.</li>
    <li> I am done using the first bottle of Anti-Aging Cream - MezmerEYES by Protege.  As of right now, I see NO DIFFERENCE at all in the skin and wrnkles around my eyes.  I am currently trying to decide whether or not I want to continue using this product and spending the money for it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of eye creams and some actually make the puffiness worse, while others have given me a headache.  The good thing is that this product doesn&#x27;t give me  either of those reactions.  I think this is helping a little, but I&#x27;ll need to use it longer to be sure.  I do wish it were in a simple squeeze bottle so that I could just apply the amount I need.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this but It feels like it&#x27;s burning my under eyes after applied. Not sure if that&#x27;s what it suppose to do but it makes me uncomfortable and I just want to wash it off right away. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I like this eye cream, but the pump bottle it comes in is terrible.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective one but it does not reliably pump.</li>
    <li> Ack, those little lines around the eyes are the bane of my existence.  In my quest to find something to make those lines less noticeable, short of a face lift, I was happy to come upon this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works.  After only a week or so of use, I noticed that those pesky little lines are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The natural ingredients.  This product has:  vitamin a, licorice, caffeine, jojoba seed oil, aloe vera leaf extract, almond seed oil, avocado oil and hyaluronic acid, among other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* No scent.  This is a pet peeve of mine since so many facial products are ruined by a strong and unpleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Only a small amount is needed, so the bottle will last a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one minor thing about this product is that the little pump is hard to work.  I pump it gently because I don&#x27;t want a lot to come out at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an eye cream that is not greasy, yet works, this may be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* A free sample of this product was provided to me for testing and review.</li>
    <li> This cream is absorbed into the skin without leaving any greasy film behind.  I could literally &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; it working on the sensitive skin under my eyes.  I don&#x27;t think any eye cream can completely remove puffiness from under your eyes.  I have tried a lot of different eye creams and I would rate this one as one of the best because of how it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this eye cream - it&#x27;s great!  I&#x27;ve been using it a relatively short amount of time with significant results.  A+++</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on all the FIVE STAR REVIEWS, but it seems the company is paying off these people for reviews. I clicked on 7 of the most recent reviewers and the only review they have left is for this product. They have no picture or info, just left a review for one product.  Seems very fishy to me.  Sure, some legit people bought this but I bet they didn&#x27;t give it good reviews because it doesn&#x27;t work. If you will notice &amp;#34;the most helpful critical review&amp;#34; was written by someone who actually has an account and reviews other things they buy. I used it for two weeks and woke up with my puffy eyes worse than when I didn&#x27;t use this product. Did nothing for wrinkles and the dark circles were just as bad. Don&#x27;t give your money to people that scam you into buying something.</li>
    <li> Noting working for me yet</li>
    <li> My one complaint about Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; Beauty MezmerEYES is that there are TONS of air bubbles in the product. And sometimes, I have to pump 30 or more times to get even a tiny drop of the product to come out. That means that the volume in the container is taken up by the bubbles and not by the product, so I feel like I&#x27;m paying for bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I really like the product. It like how it absorbs and my puffy eyes definitely seem diminished when I use it. But I may not purchase it again, because of the frustration with pumping so many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update later on 4/17/2014 -&lt;br /&gt;After writing this review, Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; contacted me to say there was a defect in the manufacture of the item and they are sending me a replacement bottle. They also kindly gave me a discount code for any of their other products, which I have used. I told them I would edit my review again to 5 stars if the pump works correctly. I really do like the product; I notice a difference when I use it. I just don&#x27;t like all the air bubbles.</li>
    <li> I used a the whole jar in 3 weeks. Felt cool on my eyes and it &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; like it should work (it did tingle) However, I saw no improvement in the puffiness under my eyes, the dark circles or my dry eyelids. I will continue my search for the perfect eye cream. If anyone knows of the one, let me know!</li>
    <li> Just started using it. So far so good. Was hoping it would feel a little lighter. But seems to work well.</li>
    <li> This product works almost instantly, in about 3 days, noticed a huge difference in my eyes.  It is allergy season right now, so it is a real blessing to have.  Product is as advertised and I love the neat dispenser it comes in, no mess or overspill of product.  Ended up buying it for my friend for a birthday present.  I love this eye cream!</li>
    <li> This eye cream dried the skin out around my eyes terribly!  I looked worse after using it, I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I ran out of my usual Loreal eye cream and searched Amazon for reviews of a good product.  I searched for a cream with caffeine and found this.  I see a difference after only one week!  I especially liked the tutorial for where to apply eye cream (further away from your eyelids than you would expect).  I used to wake up with puffy eyes every morning and they&#x27;ve been much better!  I also like that you can &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; it working.  It&#x27;s like a tingly/tightening sensation about 5 minutes after you put it on.  I&#x27;m not sure if that means it&#x27;s working or what, but it definitely gives that impression!  Hope I can keep getting this product at this price!</li>
    <li> I turned 37 and I started getting dark circles under my eyes and people started telling me I look tired.  I&#x27;ve had it for a week and noticed a difference immediately.  I would have gave it 5 stars but it doesn&#x27;t completely remove my dark circles.  But, still.  Its a huge improvement.</li>
    <li> I put a small dot on each eye lid and bottom and smooth into my skin. I love it. thank you. not a bad price.</li>
    <li> I used this product, as recommended, for over a month. I found it to tighten and moisturize the eye area well. It immediately feels refreshing, upon application. However.....it does sting a bit (not a big deal for me-most of them do), and I didn&#x27;t see any difference (AT ALL) in my dark circles, puffiness, or fine lines. Additionally, this product balls up BADLY, when attempting to apply other creams and/or makeup over it. Another rather annoying con: the pump only works about 30% of the time on the first pump. It usually took a lot of shaking and numerous pumps to even retrieve any product at all. It got to the point where I could no longer stand it, and gave it away before I even finished it.</li>
    <li> I had never bought or used eye cream before but when I began to see fine lines appearing under my eyes, I knew it was time.  I did quite a bit of research and considered buying a very expensive cream.  I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t! I read so many positive reviews of this cream that I took a chance.  Within a week, I could tell a difference.  Now, one month later- my skin looks just like it did when I was in my 20s.  I highly recommend this eye cream and am buying it for all the women in my family.  It&#x27;s great and so worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my first purchase of this eye cream, I noticed results and it hydrated the eye area nicely.  I was so happy I re-purchased, but I&#x27;m wondering if the formula has changed.  This new bottle seems to leave the eye area drier and also tends to irritate my skin.  Too bad, I thought I had finally found an eye cream I could stick with!</li>
    <li> I have under eye circles and puffiness. I have tried every home remedy and product out there. MezmerEyes worked instantly for me! The Cream arrived beautifully packaged and was a generous size. The Cream is rich and a little goes a long way. My Eyes felt instantly hydrated. I apply the cream 2 times per day and have no problem wearing it under my make up. I have only been using the product for 3 days and already I have noticed a significant change in the appearance of my dark circles and bags. I highly recommend this product! This is honestly the best product I have ever used for my eyes.</li>
    <li> Protege Beauty MezmerEYES Anti-aging Eye Cream is a nice product to moisturize the area around your eyes.  I used this cream for about a month--in fact, I keep it by my computer so that while I am working and without makeup, I can quickly apply this cream.  The cream is applied by pumping a miniscule amount on the fingertip and then dabbing around the eye.  The applicator allows you to apply as much as you need without wasting any.  I found that the cream did moisturize the skin around my eye in a way that did not feel greasy and did not dry or flake. (On one occasion, I did apply twice--and I did find the cream to flake because I over applied it--so use this cream sparingly.) I find that it works best when applied before the bath or shower--the steaming effect helps the cream to penetrate--or before bedtime.  I do not apply this cream before I put on eye makeup because I do believe it would cause smearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I cannot report any decrease in lines--I am fairly lucky and do not have obvious lines and creases.  Nevertheless, I will say that I do think daily applications of creams such as this does help to keep the eye area free of such lines--so use it as a preventative.  As I do not have dark circles, I cannot report on the claimed aspect of this cream as a dark circle cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line?  For the price, Protege Beauty MezmerEYEs Anti-Aging Cream is a good product.  A sparing application before bedtime or bath time will help prevent lines and wrinkles in the delicate eye area.  Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Diana Faillace Von Behren&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;reneofc\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now and I can clearly see a difference with the fine lines around my eyes, very happy of the results and ordered a 2nd bottle!</li>
    <li> I have only had this cream 3 days and it has already made a difference. Dark circles and bags under the eyes is a family thing and unfortunately I got that gene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few hours after applying the cream under my eyes, the puffiness was almost completely gone. I didn&#x27;t even realize my eyelids were puffy until there was a noticeable decrease. I still have the dark circles but it only been a few days. I will be purchasing this product over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 6, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have a complaint about this product. It seems like there is more air in the pump than actual cream. Plus you can&#x27;t control how much cream comes out of the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 12, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be ordering this product again. The pump just doesn&#x27;t work all that well. I am still getting air out of it and it is almost gone. Sometimes is squirts a little cream then other times it will squirt way too much cream. It really was working for my under eye puffiness, but I can&#x27;t see spending the money for air.</li>
    <li> I used it for a week and only noticed that it just freezes your face in place. It lays on top of the skin and doesn&#x27;t allow it to move. I would compare it to the instant wrinkle removers from the 80&#x27;s where your face is just tight with glue.</li>
    <li> The First time I put it on, you can instantly feel it tightening everything!  My eye puffiness is definitley less!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a product called EmbelLash,an eyelash serum . There was nothing wrong with it but I did not find it to work as well as I hoped it would.When Protege Beauty wrote to make sure I was satisfied I explained I was disappointed in the product. They immediately refunded my money and I was so impressed by their concern and immediate refund I will definitely purchase from them again. In a world where no one seems to care anymore it was very refreshing to experience their superior customer service. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I just started using it for three days and it really feels refreshing when I apply it. I havent seen any changes yet, but I hope it appears soon! It is very tightning and you can feel it when it dries up. The only thing i dont like is that it isnt fast absorbing for me. I mean it does get absorp but takes couple of seconds for it to completely dry! I bouht one for my sister and she absolutely loves it as well. She can feel the tightness around her baggy eyes!</li>
    <li> Have not used this eye cream long enough to review.  Hubby has been ill....thank you.  I will review at a later date.</li>
    <li> Ive Been using it a few weeks.  Haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in my dark circles.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I saw the ad for this in Instyle magazine.  I decided to try it and it works better than any other eye cream I have used.  I noticed a difference in about a week.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for an eye cream that is not greasy or irritating...MEZMEREYES is it!  It goes on and moisturizes my eye area so well.  I have noticed a reduction in the lines and wrinkles around my eyes as well as a decrease in the puffiness in my under eye area.  I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I am very unhappy with this product as it burned my skin around the eye contours where the cream is applied. It made the areas around my eyes more puffy. I would like to request for refund of this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucita Tiongson</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a couple of weeks.  I use in the morning after my shower under my makeup and at night after I have removed my makeup.  This works GREAT for puffiness under my eyes.  Works for fine lines too.  I still have dark circles and some deep wrinkles. But I will probably order again.  A little goes along way.</li>
    <li> Can not tell any difference but that may because the product seemed to be partially dried up and very thick to the point of barely able to get any product out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> It worked for the first few times I used it and stopped working. It tighten the skin under my eyes and did a great job but now it will not work well at all.</li>
    <li> Looked online at reviews to find an eye product that actually works for swelling and dark circles.  I love this stuff!  I don&#x27;t wear makeup but I put this on each morning and notice the difference right away.  Great product and great service!</li>
    <li> I consider myself pretty knowledgeable when it comes to skin care products.  Read every magazine about beauty am 54 yrs old blonde blue eyed and genetically have puffy baggy looking eyes.  I have used every product from macys carson&#x27;s well you get it.  I have been using StriVecten for my puffiness and was pleased I noticed a reduced amount took about 6 weeks to work.  Read about this eye cream  somewhere.  I read all most all reviews on any product I am considering.  Within 2 weeks I cannot believe the improvement, I don&#x27;t have to hide in the morning because my face looks gross.  Not all products work for everyone.  I use it twice a day everyday.  It does tingle, I have a great Dermatologist she gives me a rx for Retin A.  She says if the skin doesn&#x27;t peel a little  it&#x27;t not working.  I don&#x27;t mean skin hanging off nasty just rough spotty areas.  So if my face cream &amp; eye cream feel a little burning for a second I know it&#x27;s working.  Try it, give it two weeks and hopefully it will work for you.</li>
    <li> I had deep bags under my eyes... now i am not saying they are completely gone but they are much less visible. You almost feel that the skin around your eyes becomes... tigher....</li>
    <li> Great product it really does work right away. However the applicator and the bottle are the absolute worst it makes you wonder why anybody would use what they use for this fine product.</li>
    <li> Do not notice any changes. Still keep on using it as of now. Will update in a month or so.</li>
    <li> I like the cream and I think it&#x27;s helping.  But, the bottle is an issue: the pump puts out waaaaay too much and it&#x27;s hard to squeeze it just half way.  And the label is tacky (meaning sticky-ish).</li>
    <li> my eyes feel moisturized all day long with just a tiny pea size drop (like a tiny pea... like a canned pea...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;spreads nicely, feels good and my eyes do feel a little brighter and less baggy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;happy and will purchase again when needed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok I  guess, didn&#x27;t see much difference ... so my husband and I stopped using it ... made my eyes feel weird in the morning, made my vision a little blurry</li>
    <li> I hate my dark circles, and this product has made an improvement.  I&#x27;ve tried many others that made no improvement whatsoever, but will definitely reorder this product.  I use it 2x/day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed how easy this works.  And the fact that it does work.  It does.  I had the puffy eyes and this has helped me tremendously in that area.  I hated looking 5-10 years older than I really am.  This cream has helped me once again look my age.  Terrific product!</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;I really am not sure of how well it could work since I keep using my old faithful one and forgetting I have this fabulous stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just using Mezmerize this month to check it out.</li>
    <li> The cream caused my skin to peel right below my eyes and burned when I applied it.  Had to stop using.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this eye cream..i loved that it was made with natural ingredients but unfortunately this cream didn&#x27;t work for me.  It actually dried out the skin under my eyes instead of moisterizing.  i also was not able to wear concealer or under eye makeup on top of the cream.  i gave it to my mom to try hoping it was just me and she had the same issue with it.</li>
    <li> Works. I have had dark circles forever. Nothing has helped except this. It&#x27;s not a miracle but it does help. It did however dry out my under eye area and I had to cut back to applying once a day instead of twice.</li>
    <li> I so wanted to like this product. The price was good and I loved the ingredients. Sadly it did not work for me. I have used it for several days now and my eyes look worse than when I started using it. There are more fine lines, there is a red line that goes from the corner of my eye outward. My eyes feel a bit itchy and sticky. I used it last night a 3 a.m and it is now almost 7 PM the next night and my eyes still hurt. I cannot recommend this product I am not looking for miracles, however, I do not need my eyes looking worse then when I started.</li>
    <li> I really love this product and it works so well, even not applying it right like the directions said, it still worked so well.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful not to get into eyes.  It is so creamy and applies so easy and it has helped my puffiness and fine lines.  I was excited to try it so I did not read the directions first, but it still was good and but so now that I know how to apply.  It leaves skin smooth.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I’m using this cream only one week and so far, so good. I like how my skin feeling after cream applying, I&#x27;m 44 and feel like my skin under eyes is better and less dark circles even after one week of using</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two weeks and so far I really think it is making a big difference!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for sure!</li>
    <li> have only been using this for about 2 weeks so I don&#x27;t know how well it&#x27;s working yet but I like the way it feels &amp; I&#x27;ve used many high dollar products so I know the difference.  I like the pump idea because I know it keeps the product stable but a bit more comes out than I really need.  Can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This eye cream didn&#x27;t work for my dark circles and left dry flakes under them. But I asked for a refund and was kindly given one. They are 100% on their policy!</li>
    <li> Just started using it...I&#x27;ll try it for a few weeks and then review it here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a half now, and so far I am seeing a huge improvement in the dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;ve had perpetual dark circles for years now, and I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products for it. My dark circles get even worse when I am PMSing, and that is exactly what is happening right now. This time however, since I&#x27;ve been using this product, the dark circles are minimal. It absorb decently. My biggest issue is that the pump gives too much product. A little goes a long way, so I am pretty close to just opening the top and getting the product out that way. Overall, I really am enjoying this product and I am excited to see if long-time wear improves my eyes even more.</li>
    <li> Ilove this  product. I am so happy with the results and I have tried pretty much every eye cream and this is far superior. The customer service it really amazing. I will be sure and check out their other products</li>
    <li> Been using this product since I received it(exactly as instructed), I don&#x27;t see any major changes. It seems like it works like every other eye cream I have used.&lt;br /&gt;1 complaint I have is that the vacuume pump seems to deliver more than a pea size amount, 2 much product and u can&#x27;t put it back.&lt;br /&gt;I like it fine.</li>
    <li> I am 57 and I have always had puffiness under my eyes. When you first apply it you can feel the tightening. After about a week you can see slight results. I am on week 3 and I am amazed!!! The puffiness is gone and my eyes have a great lift throughout the day!</li>
    <li> Like nearly every other reviewer for this product, I&#x27;ve had dark circles under my eyes for it seems like my whole life.  Even when I was a kid my mother would occasionally look at me and ask, &amp;#34;Do you feel OK?  You&#x27;ve got these DARK CIRCLES under your eyes!&amp;#34;  And now that I&#x27;m getting older sometimes they get puffy, too, which is even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products over the years, and this is the best one yet.  It was not the dramatic overnight miracle I was hoping for (that&#x27;s why 4 stars instead of 5), but I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and there is definite improvement.  My only regret now is that I didn&#x27;t take a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things I really like about it are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Before you even receive it in the mail you get an email from the company explaining exactly how to apply it.  Be sure to follow those directions to the letter.  I had overlooked the part about not putting it right on top of crows feet, which is why I think my results weren&#x27;t as good at first - it&#x27;s better now that I&#x27;m following the directions exactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- When you put it on, you get a nice cool, tingling sensation, and you can actually feel it tightening the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - not a miracle in a bottle, but the best thing I&#x27;ve found yet, and pretty reasonably priced, so I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this cream, I honestly didn&#x27;t know what to expect .  I am not a fan of leaving reviews whether good or bad.  But I really wanted to share my experience because I was skeptical.  I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 6wks now and what a difference in the world it has made.  I have dark circles under my eyes and my doctor recommended me to use an over the counter cream with vitamin c to clear them up.  The prescription was really expensive so thought I would look what I could find on amazon.  I researched so many products and can imagine the selection, there&#x27;s just so many out there.  I decided to give this cream a chance because I wanted a cream with Vitamin C, and after reading about ingredients that help reduce dark circles I chose mezmereyes, because of the natural ingredients it contained.&lt;br /&gt;I can say without a doubt that this cream has solved my problems.  I could have posted a review much sooner since it was improving only after a few weeks, but now since my bottle is almost finished I can give my honest review.  This cream is nothing short of meeting its claims and I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this product! I bought it from Amazon...received it in 2 days and immediately put this product on my eyes. The following morning, I looked in the mirror and I&#x27;ve already noticed an improvement in my crows feet and bags. They&#x27;re not gone, it&#x27;s not a miracle cream...but to notice an improvement overnight...that&#x27;s saying something!! So far, so good!! Thank you!!! :)</li>
    <li> I am unable to use this product.  It burns above and below my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and was hoping this would work.</li>
    <li> Total garbage. It&#x27;s like a layer of skin. It flakes off during the day and did nothing for the bags under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, nice consistency, great under another moisturizer or just by itself. I only use it in the evening because of the retinol ingredient. I like creams with a pump so it stays clean and air free.</li>
    <li> No change at this time. I will continue to use this until it is gone but do not expect much. Probably will not buy again</li>
    <li> This awesome and does what it says it worked for me  The very first day. I just added a moisturizer after.</li>
    <li> Note a much effect as I had hoped but it does work</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over two weeks.  At 54 years of age, I don&#x27;t expect miracles, but  I am very pleased with the results I&#x27;m seeing.  The fine lines at the corners of my eyes have visibly diminished, and the skin around my eyes appears brightened.  The cream has a nice consistency, and it absorbs quickly into the skin.  I follow the excellent instructions for use that are included with the product, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with stinging or discomfort to my eyes.  Not only is the eye cream top-notch, I&#x27;m equally as impressed with the Protege company&#x27;s customer service.  I also love the fact that it&#x27;s a made in the USA product.  I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing the eye cream again, and I&#x27;m planning on trying the daily moisturizer as well.</li>
    <li> Not really seeing a big change.  Definitely smooths the under eye area but bags are still there; some days better than others.  Dark circles have never been my issue; mostly just bags.  Not sure is I would buy again...</li>
    <li> I have seen this make a raised Brown spot almost disappear on the area just below the end of my brow line and clearly smooth out texture, lines and smooth out skinonthe area above my eyelids. I had never used anything in this area so don&#x27;t want to be w/o now. The follow up customer service to answer any questions I might have had and educate are awesome. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love it...how I know it is working?  When I skip a day (and a night) I can see the difference.</li>
    <li> Appears to tighten the undereye skin &amp; diminish bags somewhat --- HOWEVER, the minute you crinkle your eyes, it looks like dried egg whites or something similar.  The only thing I could recommend it for is to pose for a portrait.  It would temporarily give one an improved appearance, as long as one didn&#x27;t change facial expressions.  Would NOT recommend it for daily camouflage of bags.</li>
    <li> I had serious dark circles especially around my left eye. The dermatologist said to use cosmetics to cover it as there was no solution to lighten it. I was very reluctant to use your products, but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. It is less than a month that I have been using &amp;#34;mezmereyes&amp;#34; and to my amazement, I can see that some of the darkness has begin to fade&lt;br /&gt;I hope that as I continue to apply it morning and at night the rest of the darkness will fade&lt;br /&gt;Ii am going took into your other products and see what other skin care products you make.&lt;br /&gt;Than you for an outstanding product</li>
    <li> I have had two surgeries performed to help out with bags/circles; a fat deposit and a subsequent blepharoplasty. A year after the final surgery, my eyes were still retaining a substantial amount of water which led to puffiness.  This product began working within the first week and alleviated many of the problems that I was having.  I didn&#x27;t expect much since it was rather cheap but this was perfect for my needs. I look less tired and feel much better when I look into the mirror.  A+</li>
    <li> I bought this to use because my eyes are puffy underneath. After about 2 weeks, I could notice a huge difference! Now, a month later, they rarely look puffy (unless I just woke up!). There are fine lines around my eyes, and they are less noticeable now when I smile. If the cream will not come out of the pump, turn it upside down. I store it this way. I def. recommend it and I plan on checking out the face cream.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product expecting a moisturizing cream and got so much more.  Prior to using this product I thought that under eye dark circles were something that you lived with or concealed.  I was proven wrong by this product.  After using the product for a couple of days, I was going through my morning routine, part of which is applying an under eye concealer before my BB cream.  To my surprise I couldn&#x27;t see the dark circles and didn&#x27;t need to apply concealer.  I just used my BB cream.  This one is definitely a keeper.  I highly recommend this product for anyone with dark under eye circles.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the product. While I took no before or after pictures per se, I think there are noticeable and improved effects around my eyes.  Also, what particularly impressed me was that I was having difficulty with the pump to get the cream out of the small bottle and customer service was very responsive and offered another bottle. I had not requested it because their emails reflected an eagerness for customer reviews and so I offered one.  The reply was immediate and impressive.  I hope this company does well due to the combination of a well priced and effective product combined with superior customer service - an unusual combination these days.</li>
    <li> I love the way this works.. My only complaint is the pump. It doesn&#x27;t always work , and takes a lot of pumping to get it out. The product itself is great !</li>
    <li> This has been a great product for my &amp;#34;over 40&amp;#34; eyes. I see less puffiness each morning. My &amp;#34;dark circles&amp;#34; are less obvious and people comment that I look rested and healthy.</li>
    <li> I have received several mails from the maker of this product and I have answered, truthfully.  the mezmerEYES cream IS WONDERFUL.  I use it twice a day, after washing my face with a WARM soft cloth.  I pat the cream light around the eyes, below and above, ; a gentle tapping with the ring finger, not only applies the cream gently, but seems to work as a gentle massage.  I don&#x27;t have to rub it in.  it absorbs very well.  the only problem is the pump, which is being taken care of by the PROTEGE people.  I have used a clean eye shadow brush, instead and even q- tips.  however, this problem is recognized by the manufacture and is being corrected. I look forward to keep buying this as it does improve my eyes.  thank you PROTEGE!</li>
    <li> I did not notice this eye cream doing anything more than the other eye cream I was using but I do like it.</li>
    <li> Worked great for my dark circles. Did not like the pump so I just unswist the top off. But over all its a good product I could feel it tighten my skin.</li>
    <li> No results whatsoever. It&#x27;s back to concealer for me for my dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason for 2 stars instead of 1: If you are looking for a moisturizer then this maybe an option for you.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several weeks and I am beginning to see a difference.  The instructions that come with the product are very clear.  The company is really interested in their product and does provide personal service if you have a question.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell any difference in the bags under my eyes or any help with drooping eyelids.</li>
    <li> I think I need more time to tell. A lot comes out at one pump. So far I like it  and hope to see a difference soon</li>
    <li> I have not seen any improvement</li>
    <li> Really wanted to love this product.  The pump dispenses too much cream for one application, requiring me to open the dispenser or waste product.  Also, when I apply concealer to my under eye region, even after waiting several minutes for the cream to dry, skin flakes off and is really disgusting as it mixes in with concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good news, the cream seems to help with lines and bags.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the good reviews. However, this cream turned my skin red and made it peel. I used just a little bit and it felt my skin was on fire. Some products work for others and some don&#x27;t. Wished it worked on mine.</li>
    <li> I like this eye cream at night because it is heavy and soothing. I also feel like my lines have gotten smaller. I tried to use it during the day and my foundation &amp;#34;crumbled&amp;#34; over it. Overall it is a very nice &amp;#34;night eye cream.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love the product! Doesn&#x27;t bother eyes when you place on lids and under eye area. When you put in gym bag, the pump doesn&#x27;t work well, but works fine if left straight up on counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, this isn&#x27;t a product you can throw in your make-up bag, this is a great product and the customer service is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;I have to give 5 stars for the product inside, but 4 for the container its in.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product but am not wild about the packaging.  Product can be difficult to get out and simpler packaging may make that easier.  A simple glass jar with a cap.</li>
    <li> I received  this product approximately 3 wks  ago and have been using it twice a day for the last 2 wks (on vacation 1st wk ). I had been searching for sometime for an eye cream/serum that really works on dark circles and puffiness.  I read the reviews concerning Mezmereyes and decided to give it a try (and at such a great price).  At 2 wks use I really have not seen much of a reduction in dark circles or puffiness, but then, what may work on someone the next day, may require a longer period of time for another. I like the moisturing effect and the naturalness of this product, and really have nothing negative to say about mezmereyes. I believe, given more time I may see the results I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> I really liked this cream but after a while, not so much. It smells really good! And a little goes a long way so it lasts a long time! But every time I put it on I experience a burning sensation, not sure if that just means it&#x27;s working or not? And I can only wear it at night if I&#x27;m planning on putting makeup on in the morning. When I put my concealer on after putting the cream on, it made my concealer get clumpy on my eyes and it wouldn&#x27;t blend at all! I had to wash everything off my eyes and start over with no eye cream.  Besides those few things. It is a great product and I can see a difference on my appearance! I just wish I could wear my concealer over it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just my opinion, but I think this product is overpriced for the amount you get in the bottle. Also, it felt like my skin got hot when I applied this cream. It just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I know i have been using the cream for a couple of weeks and I see some improvement but I am also not sure if it is from some of the other products I use where I have crow&#x27;s feet (retinol). I did use it one morning and my under eyes turned red. I am going to just use at night and give it more time. Just check in a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this cream and can feel it work as i put it on. You guys make a body firming cream</li>
    <li> Let me clarify, I don&#x27;t necessarily hate the product, I feel that the company is not truthful in their advertising.  The ingredient list on the webpage is not what is actually on the package that you receive.  I was specifically looking for a product that had sodium hyaluronate NOT hyaluronic  acid because the former is what actually penetrates the skin and is the humectant.  I contacted the company immediately and they basically said it was and oversite/ typo/accident and that they would change the error right away. Well, I waited about a month now and the same advertising exists and it is FALSE!  As far as the product goes, it&#x27;s fine not great, not horrible.  I don&#x27;t have any noticeable changes.  Will not buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> it feels good after you put it on, and it goes on easy, with no burning or any irritation, so far.  I am not sure how much difference it makes, as I am only using it a week, but I think it does a nice job of making your eyes feel better, especially in the A.M.</li>
    <li> Only seen a little difference. I would expect for it to take more time.  It is a light lotion and blends in well</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for almost 8 weeks and it hasn&#x27;t made a difference. I bought the cream due to all the great reviews, but I guess it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Been using it for couple of weeks now. See no difference only good thing is it does not cause any burning sensation after applying.&lt;br /&gt;I will wait for few more weeks to give a final verdict</li>
    <li> Made my skin worse.  Do not recommend.  Does not do what it claims to do.  A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Fairly easy to apply and have had friends say that there was a noticeable difference with the bags under my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is a nice cream for the money and the customer service is GREAT!</li>
    <li> Not sure I notice any difference but, I am old, so.....</li>
    <li> Eye cream reduced dark circles and puffiness Overnight! I am so happy... I can&#x27;t wait to see what further use will bring.&lt;br /&gt;I am a MezmerEyes customer for life</li>
    <li> Seeing my dark circles lightening little by little and I&#x27;m looking forward to the continuing results! I&#x27;m very glad I decided to try this product. I put it on when I go to bed at night and have a heated eye mask to relax my eyes and absorb the cream as I go to sleep. It feels wonderful and I&#x27;m seeing improvements within about 2 to 3 weeks of using the cream. I&#x27;ll have to add this to my regular purchases. Thanks!</li>
    <li> No comment on the product itself.  The bottle design is a disaster.  This product should be dispensed from a pump, not a bottle opening.  There is no way to get this stuff out of the container other than knocking it around like a ketchup bottle.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s not magic, but it&#x27;s effective and works at least as well as the cream I was paying $70 for at my doctor&#x27;s. In fact, it&#x27;s probably the best eye cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Have been using for about 3 weeks &amp; feel that it works okay. Pump puts too much at a time and have to waste some almost every time. Has a sticky texture that applies fine but once it dries you have to make sure you don&#x27;t accidentally rub it around or it peels off. Does not wear well under make up, so I use it at night only. Overall just an okay product.</li>
    <li> I think this eye cream is just fine. Nothing miraculous, but no miracle was expected either. It is very soft and just takes a dab to apply.</li>
    <li> I like this eye cream, but I don&#x27;t see any changes from using it for about 3 weeks. My eyes do feel nice and soft - but no changes in the look of them. Dark circles and puffiness is still the same.</li>
    <li> The quality and results of this product are amazing. I started seeing results two weeks after I started using it, my skin felt moisturized. In terms of costumer service, I have to say that the company was able to solve my problems effectively. I got in touch with them to say that the pump wasn&#x27;t working that well and they sent a replacement for it as well as some tips for better use.</li>
    <li> The design is nice, the texture is fine. Although it doesn&#x27;t absorb completely but stays as a thin tape on the surface of skin. I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have literally tried everything (cheap to the most expensive) and this eye cream is amazing - I will forever be a loyal customer!!</li>
    <li> I am not even sure why I am saying it is okay.  I guess because I don&#x27;t necessarily &#x27;not&#x27; like it.  I purchased because it had several recommended ingredients to reduce dark eye circles and it also claims it does but I have yet to see my dark eye circles diminish.  I can&#x27;t say that I have seen any change to dark circles and/or wrinkles around eyes.  Another thing I am confused by is recommendation by them and other anti-aging creams to &#x27;not&#x27; put just any old cream too close to your eye but also says sun damage is leading cause of dark circles.  This leads me to believe you almost have to put a cream with an SPF somewhat close to your eye.  So I guess I will just chaulk stuff up to &#x27;getting older&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I only used it once or twice but didn&#x27;t like it. There was something about it not absorbing well and even though my Eve Pearl undereye concealer is fantastic, I couldn&#x27;t get it to &#x27;sit&#x27; well over the cream. So, I gave it away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for around a month now, and my eyes still look horrible. However, after 30 minutes of putting it on, you can feel and see your skin temporarily tightening, which gives the impression that its working. After that, your eyes go back to normal.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream and I will definitely buy it again. Within the first week I could feel and see the difference around my eye area. Looks and feels tighter and it takes away any puffiness as well. I also noticed a decrease in any fine lines I had around eye area. I might even consider trying some of their other face products if they work as well as this one !!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is ok.  I am not as impressed as I was hoping to be.  I use it twice daily according to the instructions.  No big changes to note.  Glad I bought it on sale.  Will keeping looking for the right one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after a girlfriend&#x27;s recommendation. She boasted how well it worked for her and how pleased she was from the results after using it for a couple months. Needless to say this cream has done wonders for me. I&#x27;ve been using it just over 4 weeks now following the recommended application procedure and I truly see a significant reduction in puffiness around my eyes. I&#x27;ll be switching over to MezmerEYES indefinitely as I love the fact it contains natural ingredients, hasn&#x27;t been tested on animals (which is very important to me) and the fact its made a huge improvement to my appearance and confidence.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything for dark circles.  Literally nothing.</li>
    <li> Not greasy... Have not seem improvement of the fine lines yet.</li>
    <li> I have been using MezmerEYES for almost three weeks and have seen a dramatic improvement in my appearance. The puffiness under my eyes is  gone and the fine lines and wrinkles around the eyes have truly minimized. I am also using Protege&#x27;s Collage, Emfaceize, and Resurface, and I must say, I look pretty damn good. These products have taken years off my age, and I love that! No more hopping around from product to product looking for the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; beauty miracle, I&#x27;ve found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marie McGowan</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving MezmerEyes a 4. In approximately 3 weeks of using this under eyes product, I&#x27;ve seen the improvement in the  appearance of my eyes and cheek bones. The dark circle is gradually fading, and the puffiness has decreased. I&#x27;ll continue to use the eye cream, and possibly add a Protege face moisturizer too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a week now, following instructions carefully.  Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in puffiness under eyes.  But then, I&#x27;m in my mid-70&#x27;s and may have expected too much.  Won&#x27;t return it, will keep using just to be sure I&#x27;m fair to the product.</li>
    <li> This really works!!! I have used many other products who claim to reduce under eye bags and have seen little to no results.  I was skeptical of Mezmereyes Eye Cream&#x27;s claims but was desperate not to look &amp;#34;old and tired&amp;#34; at my son&#x27;s upcoming graduation.  I am very pleased to report that in less than 30 days, using it twice a day, there was a drastic reduction of my bags.  I even like the photos of myself taken at graduation!  I will continue to use the eye cream as well as recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;Most sincerely!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> dont bother it doesnt work miracles</li>
    <li> Tried this eye cream to again try to eliminate or at least reduce the puffiness/bags under my eyes. Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Great product! The cream reduces the bags and puffiness under my eyes, making me look and feel younger. The price was reasonable enough to give it a try and I am glad that I did. I think that you should too!</li>
    <li> It is great eye cream!  Follow the instructions and you will see the results in about two weeks. Amazing customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely buy through this company again.</li>
    <li> I have been using MezmerEYES eye cream for a few weeks now and here&#x27;s my feedback thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The cream is easy to apply and absorbs quickly when I apply it following the instructions provided.  The area around the eyes does feel warm after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My biggest hope was for this cream to tighten my upper eye lids and I have yet to see any noticeable results.  I&#x27;m a 35-year old mother with average weight and average height.  Since I had my 3 children in the past 5 years, my upper eye lids began to sag and wrinkle quite a bit.  This cream has not helped in improving the elasticity of my eye lids.  It makes me wonder if the cream was designed to target bags under eyes, or wrinkles around the eyes, or elasticity of eye lids.  I really need help with the last one and have not seen any results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It was initially hard to get the correct amount of cream out of the pump.  But after several tries, I&#x27;ve figured out a way to very carefully give it a light push.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I had been using Lumie&#x60;re  by Neocutis  The MezmerEYES works just as well and its a lot cheaper.  I especially like it cause it doesn&#x27;t make my mascara or eyeliner smear.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about this cream - it leaves a little residue/is flaky after it dries, so I wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled about how it felt.  BUT, I also noticed that I no longer have the horrible bags and dark circles under my eyes!!!  So far this is the only cream that has worked for that, so I&#x27;m definitely buying again.</li>
    <li> Plain and simple, it does not diminish dark under eye circle or fine lines. Used the entire bottle and saw nothing. Nice moisture for under your eyes, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> To short usage to say anything about supplementing effects but so far I&#x27;m happy of choosing this product.</li>
    <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes for years.  This is one of the few products that have ever made them less noticeable.  It does not burn, works well and is not too expensive.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I waited 5 weeks before providing my review (for it to actually be helpful). I applied it twice a day. Although the skin around my eyes is almost 50 years old, it doesn&#x27;t have a great deal of wrinkles- just the darkening, and folding right under my lower lid- along with the usual crows feet (outer edges). Within a week, i could see tightening and lessening of the lines. Within 2 weeks, the dark circles disappeared. By three weeks I stopped the twice daily application. The area under my eyes were to light- and for someone with dark skin, who doesn&#x27;t use concealers- strange- the opposite of raccoon eyes!  So I went down to using a few drops only at night. The one qualm I have: Mesmereyes is not very moisturizing. So now I combine it with a heavier eye cream. I found that a few drops of Mesmereyes is still keeping the area around my eyes looking great. I will definitely reorder it- and rely on it to keep any dark circles and fine lines away- when mixed with a moisturizing eye cream. Hope this helped.</li>
    <li> I have not any difference yet. It&#x27;s only been about 3 weeks. If I start to see results, I&#x27;ll upgrade this review.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product.  There are no miracles when it comes to skin care (wrinkles &amp; bags) but I feel this product goes a long way to improving those issues.  I would recommend it and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now. Noticeable decrease in puffiness and circles.</li>
    <li> product does lighten the dark eye circles. Eyes appear better, skin more supple and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I just received the product, and there is no &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; on the pump, so nothing comes out of the bottle when you pump it.  i have to return it..  Nothing should be shipped in this kind of condition.</li>
    <li> Does not work on under eye darkness like it states, but it does have an instant firming effect.  Just ok, prob won&#x27;t re-order.</li>
    <li> Have been using MesmerEYES regularly for 4 weeks and my review is as follows: MesmerEYES does not work well for fine wrinkles and lacks adequate moisturizer. Whenever I apply the cream, it sets into my fine lines making them appear larger and deeper - its pretty disturbing and scary seeing this effect! It seems like my subtle fine lines have become more prominent as a result of using this product. They instruct that the cream is to be applied farther away from the eye, but I&#x27;ve never had to do that with other reputable eye creams. It seems to work OK for dark circles, but I&#x27;ve noticed over time that the skin under my eyes appears dried out. As a result, I&#x27;ve been using other creams in addition to or as a substitute to MezmerEYES to keep my eyes properly moisturized. Wish this product worked better and will likely return it.</li>
    <li> Update 02.12.15 Still love this but I was SHOCKED at the size.  It looks like it is about half the size of the ones I have had before.  LOVE this product.  I really see a reduction in the puffiness under my eyes with this that I have not seen with anything else.  I tried some other eye cream for about a month but went right back to this.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mezmereyes for about 6 weeks and I have already noticed the fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable. The skin around my eyes definitely feels tighter. Great product!&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave the product 4 stars instead of 5 is because the pump is very sensitive. I press the pump very carefully and still end up with just slightly more than I intend to. I use the extra product on my vertical lines in-between  my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
    <li> Im pretty sure the ovet 1 star reviews were written by the sellers. This is the Worst eye cream! It&#x27;s not even really a cream. It leaves a weird film on your skin that peels and flakes off. Almost like a mask. There&#x27;s no way of ever using it under makeup. I decided to try it before bed. Used it for a few weeks and it didn&#x27;t even help with moisturizing the eye area. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It works extremely well. Coming off a sinus infection I went out with my work group and had a few to many. Next morning....not good for the eyes. Dark, puffy etc. This stuff did amazing work. Better than I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> Definetly hydrates, think it works a little, but not alot. I have dark circles and puffiness, I&#x27;m not sure it did anything, but I feel like it did, felt good when I applied. I did buy twice, so I must have liked it a little, not sure I will buy again though.</li>
    <li> This product did not do anything its a waste of money</li>
    <li> Did not see any improvement. Does not work any better than other products on my skin,</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  It has literally taken years of age from under my eyes.  I am 62 years old and the dark circles and bags are inevitably starting to appear more and more.  After using this product my eyes area looks so much younger/better!  I love how you can literally feel it working the minute you apply it.  After using this for the last 3 weeks, my dark circles are barely there, and the puffiness is almost gone.  My husband and coworkers are mentioning how great I look, which makes me feel so wonderful.  I highly recommend this product.  I was truly surprised at how well this works, and I can&#x27;t wait to see my results in a few more weeks!</li>
    <li> I find there is some residue that can be rubbed off after application and time. It has a nice consistency going on, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent product that keeps my eye area moisturized. I wouldn&#x27;t say my wrinkles totally disappeared but at least they don&#x27;t get worse. It also helps to keep my thin upper eyelids moisturized enough so I don&#x27;t look very tired.</li>
    <li> The bottle was defective. The pump would not work. Am sending it back!</li>
    <li> This stuff is so good that my husband has started stealing it :) Wonderful to get a product that actually does what it says it will.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product- it is one of the few I actually have noticed lasting results with and a decrease in lid darkness, dark circles surrounding the eyes and fine lines! Recommended it to many friends already!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product! Def tingles when you put it on the first few times, but not in a bad way! 😉 I use it 2x a day and have noticed less visible lines and puffiness. Only downside is when you pump it once, I feel that more product comes out than need be. I hate wasting cosmetic products, especially bc they&#x27;re usually so costly. If only half the amount came out, I think it would be plenty!</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good!  The dark circles unders my eyes are extremely bad.&lt;br /&gt;I began to use this product every nite for at least 7 to 10 nites in a row....I could really notice&lt;br /&gt;the difference.  Wish I had two...one on my nite stand and the other in my makeup bag for day.</li>
    <li> Wow wow wow !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Just to say a perfect product with a perfect price and perfect results</li>
    <li> This product is very nice and I have already purchased by second tube.  It did reduce the fine lines and the dark circles around my eyes as the manufacturers claim.  It also lasts a long time because you use such a small amount.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eye cream.  I am on my second bottle and the results keep getting better.  I have found a little goes a long way, so well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Been a while since I looked for something for the circles under my eyes and got this due to good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas like any other item lower priced or many times the price from the big names it doesn&#x27;t do a thing.  sigh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep hoping someday a company will contact me with an \\&quot;Oh yeah?  Well we have a lab in your area and we want you to come by and we&#x27;re going to find out what&#x27;s going on so we can improve our product.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it hasn&#x27;t happened yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE...&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;While it hasn&#x27;t helped with what I bought it for, which is the dark circles under my eyes, it is a great moisture product in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That together with the stunning level of customer service - even the VP wrote me and then over nighted the new formulation of the product to me - leads me to give them another star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only every company followed through with their customers like this one the world would be a so much happier place.</li>
    <li> Bought two bottles and I see a slight improvement.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended ! 10 years ago or so  I suddenly developed very bad undereye bags and nobody really knows the source. I had given up on finding anything really. Just a try here again and half  hoping...absolutely amazed by this product. After just 3 days, right eye is back to normal and left eye still has a bit of a lump but by &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; I mean bad. I spent a lot of money on various products never mind the frustration.Was told by venders that there was no real product on the market which could be satisfactory. Well for me this works and I hope it will carry on working.  Very good service also. There was a malfunction about the pump but was told that a replacement is being shipped. I am happy about that for the top of the bottle including the pump was stuck in the lid, had to use pencers to retrieve and tightened it back but pump does not work at all.  Despite this, the reason I give 5 stars is that I was really taken aback. 3 days is nothing but my right eye is back to normal. My eye bags were way far worse than the pic the other lady provided. I am 50 but looked 150 and hid under coloured eyeglasses.  My left eye still has a &amp;#34;lump&amp;#34;, size of a chick pea where before I had a walnut.  Only one product worked before, one recommended by a famous doctor on TV, but did not after a while and left a white residue and was only temporary. I did not use this product at night and fully expected to see my huge eye bags back in the morning. Not so.  It is best not to apply any other eye product though. The bags kind of came back. I applied eye moisturiser on top and it was not a good idea.  But then again I am only at day 3 and not sure about the product quality ( pump problem ).  This is my first time with this company and I have been impressed so far.  I might add that I have not been paid for fair review at all.  EDIT : I changed my stars because product is not delivering anymore. The bottle was defective and was promised a replacement.  Which never came...............I was suspicious when no date nor track number were provided.  When I enquired later I was told that I had to contact amazon directly. Sorry......does not sit well with me. I paid lots of money for this and would have to send the bottle again ? out of my own pocket of course.  Whatever the cause is, product worked beautifully for 4 days or so and then it stopped..contact with the air , my hands ? do not know. Bottle almost finished now also...with the waste.</li>
    <li> I could tell it&#x27;s working, after using it for about a week and a half, a friend of mine said I don&#x27;t have any dark circles or puffy eyes at all. My eyes looked brighter and healthier :) Once I put it on, I feel it tingle too.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Best from all others that I have used so far.</li>
    <li> Bad!! I have very few lines but it made my eye area super dry. Hated it from the very first use. The positive reviews make me wonder, because I didn&#x27;t see anything whatsoever good in reviewing it!!</li>
    <li> i think this product is great the dark circles around eyes are getting lighter</li>
    <li> I ordered this eye cream as a sample for review and evaluation and I like it for eye puffiness. My husband and I get puffy eyes and this eye cream has helped to reduce it. I only put it on at night because the puffiness is at it&#x27;s peak in the morning and if I apply at night it helps to prevent that. It has not caused us any irritation and it has a nice consistency. (If you have trouble with irritation I recommend reading the info provided by the company it was very informative) It seems to absorb well (it&#x27;s a little slow to absorb but so is our other eye cream). Overall we are happy with it!</li>
    <li> I have been using the eye cream for a few weeks. I like the results I am seeing. My mother and sister have been sneaking and using it too and they have been pleased with their results as well. I plan to try other products from this line later. I have the face cream and I like it too. I will continue to use these products. I am glad I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Everyday I look like I haven&#x27;t slept in days. It&#x27;s not a good look for me. So when I was offered this Mezmereyes from Protege for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I ordered it immediately. It arrived and I put some on right away. I&#x27;ve continued to use it morning and in the evening before bed and it&#x27;s been about a week now. My eyes look fabulous! If you&#x27;re looking for  a great eye cream to help  your eyes pop, I definitely recommend this Mezmereyes from Protege.</li>
    <li> Was hoping for something better.  The best way to describe it is to say it kind of &amp;#34;freezes&amp;#34; my face and as a result, I think it makes crows feet look more pronounced.  Got it for a good price on Amazon, but doubt I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
    <li> I have to say as a guy I was a bit skeptical that this product was even for me. I found out about it because my fiance has been using it for the last several months. I saw visible changes around her eyes. I have had puffiness and my eyes have started showing very noticable signs of aging. I started using her cream at her suggestion and within a few weeks, folks were asking me if I lost weight or started working out because I look different and even younger. I have now purchased my own cream, at my fiances request and ordered another one for her to replace what I used. Thanks MezmerEyes.</li>
    <li> It probably works . However there is flaking after it dries even though I decreased the amount I used</li>
    <li> I was really excited to find a product that might make a difference treating under eye dark circles. I&#x27;ve used faithfully Morning and night.  I honestly have not had any improvement.  I&#x27;m trying to decide to continue for another month and then make a final conclusion.</li>
    <li> nice refreshing serum for your face but not moisturizing enough without additional cream and didn&#x27;t notice any less darkness or puffiness on my eyes</li>
    <li> The product is great!!! It got rid of the puffiness and bags under my eyes. The dark circles under my eyes has been reduced... thank you MezmerEYES :)</li>
    <li> This eye cream is odd...almost acts like a mask, drying out your skin. It burns, dries up and flakes off. If i have it on and i smile, the area around my eyes crinkles.  The next morning my wrinkles appear deeper.  I have been wearing this at night only and no improvement.  There is no way i could wear it during the day.  I am giving up.</li>
    <li> As a mid-aged woman who stares at a computer all day and stays up late, my eyes started sagging and developing wrinkles.  I have used many eye creams, from expensive to drug store brands, to help my poor eyes. It has been challenging to find a natural cream to help me combat the strain I continue to put my eyes through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A found Mezmereyes.  All I can say is &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34;  This cream instantly absorbs into my skin for a revitalized and bright look.  It makes my eyes feel soft.  Other creams I&#x27;ve used leaves a sticky residue; eventually, the film begins to ball up and flake.  Mezmereyes soaks into my skin to leave radiant and moisturized skin.  It might be my imagination but  my dry, sagging and wrinkled eyes have improved since I used this cream.</li>
    <li> This really works! I have puffy eyes and this really helps in the morning and I even use it before bedtime to help me in the morning as well. I would highly suggest this! It doesn&#x27;t have a tightening effect with a slight burn but nothing bad. I do have sensitive skin. No redness or anything; the puffiness has diminished and I love this as it makes me look so much younger and healthier!</li>
    <li> I use this twice each day. Morning and night.  Use it regularly and you ill see results in no time.</li>
    <li> Thought I would try this product out to see how it would help diminish&lt;br /&gt;Very fine lines around eyes. I can say that I noticed a difference in&lt;br /&gt;The appearance of it helping you look refreshed an it minimizes or covers up&lt;br /&gt;Light lines. I am only 29, but religiously believe in moisturizing and&lt;br /&gt;Ultimate skin care regularly to preserve youth. I ran out quickly was&lt;br /&gt;The downside. Not much product, but worth trying!</li>
    <li> had to return it unused. It was clogged.</li>
    <li> I love it!  The price was very reasonable and the quality is comparable to ridiculously expensive products.</li>
    <li> I was using this morning and night, it did not burn my skin like some have  but at times it seemed like I had more wrinkles then the day before I would say there were no changes,</li>
    <li> I am on my third bottle of Mezmereyes and I love it. Seen a definite improvement. I believe it is definitely a &amp;#34;keeper&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This product is maintaining years of careful skin care!</li>
    <li> I have bought this cream numerous times.  But now it is no longer working.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through many eye creams-I was using Roc &amp; liked it until I found this cream.  I wake up every am with fresh looking eyes &amp; zero bags.  Puffiness is a big problem for me, I even sleep with 2 pillows just to prop my head &amp; minimize morning puffiness.  About to place another order for 2 bottles this time.  The price point is right on with other high end creams.</li>
    <li> I started using the eye&lt;br /&gt;cream on 3/10 and I couldn&#x27;t  be more pleased with it, this eye cream has been&lt;br /&gt;amazing.  It has reduced  the puffiness I get under my eyes and leaves my skin&lt;br /&gt;feeling firm and refreshed.  I will be continue to purchase , I love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;and want to try the moisturizer with my next order as well as try a lot of your&lt;br /&gt;other products. I give the eye cream 5 stars !!</li>
    <li> For what it is, it is OK. My particular product&#x27;s pump is inconsistent. Sometimes it works fine, other times it does not work and I have to press it down several times to get the product to come out, which results in splatter and product wastage.</li>
    <li> My eyes are super-sensitive and It does not work for me.  It&#x27;s very harsh and stings my eyes until I remove it.  I wished it did work, I haven&#x27;t found one that does so don&#x27;t feel badly.</li>
    <li> After using this twice a day for a month, I have not seen any improvement in terms of reducing puffiness or dark spots under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream. I have noticed a visible lift on the upper lid. Under eye bags are smaller, darkness under eye is fading but not gone yet. Very happy so far. Will definitely purchase this again and again.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a couple of months now and not seeing much improvement. I will keep using it and give it some more time.</li>
    <li> This product did not work as well as I had hoped, but this is probably due to some chronic medical conditions that I have. The wonderful people at Protege sent an email to check on my experience and satisfaction. I explained that it just was not giving me the results I hoped for and also told them that it is probably due to my health issues and not their MezmerEYES. I have never had such wonderful customer service, they are over the top awesome and expect that every customer will be fully satisfied. In my case, they are offering me the opportunity to receive a different Protege item, which has been generously given to me. My experiences with this company has been fantastic. I also purchased EmbelLash which is an amazing product, my lashes are growing longer and fuller and I love this stuff. Give this company a try, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like it pretty well, after using 3 months, but just now on looking to re-order, I see it&#x27;s gone from $18.99 to $29.99!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s over a 50% increase!!!&lt;br /&gt;Guess I will be looking elsewhere again.</li>
    <li> I use very high end facial products such as MD Solar, Kinerase, Rodan &amp; Fields.  I decided to try Protege because of the ingredients.  I just started using it and love it.  I have already purchased another one.</li>
    <li> This product was supposed to help reduce my dark circles. I&#x27;ve used it regularly since I received it and I see no difference. The cream goes on smoothly, it&#x27;s a cream after all. But when it absorbs it leaves the skin under my eyes tight and uncomfortable. I will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Gone through a few different eye creams and this one works for me. It&#x27;s not like eye moisturizers which are thick--this one is thin and has an immediate firming affect.</li>
    <li> I was allergic to it. Had stabbing eye pain. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine otherwise.</li>
    <li> At this time I have used the Protege Mezmer EYES for about three weeks and see no improvement.  I will give it another week.</li>
    <li> Does absolutely nothing. I ordered it specifically because it stated it has caffeine in it which is supposed to reduce puffiness. Did not do anything. No brightening or softness either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 68 years old and didn&#x27;t have a problem with puffiness around the eyes, so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but here are my comments thus far on the product: The product definitely makes my skin feel soft and may have had some effect on wrinkles. Unfortunately the dark circles are still present.  There is slight burning when I apply the cream, but I don&#x27;t know if that indicates a positive or negative.  I&#x27;ll continue to use the eye cream in hope that additional time may provide more indications of the value. Therefore, I&#x27;ll wait to decide if I want to order it again.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  It is easy to use and provides expected results.</li>
    <li> After trying soooo many eye products I have finally found one that actually works on the puffiness. I have spent a lot of money on so many products with no results.  My puffiness has reduced tremendously.... really.  The bags were so bad that I actually considered surgical treatments but really was afraid to go that route... now I don&#x27;t have to.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this product!  The dark circles have also lightened. AAAA++++ for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this company has extraordinary customer service.  I had a slight issue with the pump and they immediately sent me a new one and didn&#x27;t even want me to send the other one back.... no return shipping!  Steve was fabulous... returned emails immediately and took care of me with that old fashioned, sincere caring.  You cannot go wrong with this product or this company.  I will definitely do business with them in the future.  It is very refreshing knowing that there is still a company  out there that actually cares about their patrons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have absolutely nothing to lose trying this product.  ENJOY!</li>
    <li> Anti-Aging Eye Cream with Caffeine and Licorice.  I have used this product for about two weeks and I have not notice a change.  Not real impressed with the product - especially since I read that it is for puffy eye area - and have not seen any results.  :o(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 65 and have excellent skin and very few wrinkles, however, some puffiness and lines around and under my eyes, which disappear when I use this cream.  First I wash my face, then use Azure 20% Vitamin C serum, then I use the Mezmereyes---they are a good combination and even though I am a cynic, I do have to admit, it works.  I also like the dispenser---if it gives more than I need, I simply reduce the pressure on the dispenser and go little by little.I&#x27;m very happy with it and will be reordering.</li>
    <li> I tried this eye cream thinking it would work for me but unfortunately all it has done is reduce my dark circles. I was hoping it would get rid of the puffiness and wrinkles under my eyes but it did not. For some people this may work but for me it has not!</li>
    <li> Significantly reduced puffiness and crows feet. Love that eyes don&#x27;t look tired any more. Great product and recommend to  anyone wanting to look a bit fresher.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few wks. It is a good eye cream and I have used many and discarded. It feels great and absorbs well. There is definitely a tightening  effect. I like it and can tell a difference even though slight in the firmness around my eyes. I will continue to use it and see how it turns out. So, I give it 4 stars.....&lt;br /&gt;Julie</li>
    <li> Had issues with the packaging - the product spurts &amp; dispenses too much.  When applied, it leaves a film under my eye, causing tiny wrinkles to look worse.  Only positive was it doesn&#x27;t make my makeup run, but overall I did not like it.</li>
    <li> Better than botox!!!!! Follow the directions from the email you will get. I have only used a couple of days and puffiness under my eyes disappeared..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for the last four months and noticed that it really does smooth out the skin around my eyes.  It does not have a scent to it and absorbs pretty quickly into the skin.  I like it so much that I bought the day and night cream made by the same company.  Hoping to get good results from those also.</li>
    <li> I us MezmerEyes every night, has already made difference, now my wife has started using it after she saw the blackness dissipate.</li>
    <li> For me, since I was just 18, I have had circles under my eyes and also puffy eyes in the morning. Both I inherited from my mother&#x27;s side of the family. And I tried just about everything including cold cucumber slices (when in season), cold wash cloths, sleeping longer at night, and the list goes on and on. You get the picture...Then I discovered this cream and gave it a try. First I washed my face well before bed and then applied the cream under  my eyes. It felt cool and wonderful under my eyes so I was hopeful. The next morning, I noticed that my under eye area did not have that puffiness or the dark circles. I was elated that I did not have to apply that awful under eye cover up that gives me that raccoon look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this product is still working well for me and I highly recommend it to you.</li>
    <li> The results have been amazing.</li>
    <li> Wonderful eye cream!! I&#x27;ve only been using this product for over a week and I see improvement on circles as well as crows feet. Also want to mention that I don&#x27;t look as tired which at my age can be a give away for your age.</li>
    <li> I love Mezmereyes eye cream. My eyes look softer and feel softer just after using for a couple of weeks. I am 57 years old and I have been looking for an eye cream that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water and itch. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I am on my second container of the anti aging eye cream.  I love it and know for certain I will use the Protege products forever.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but I read the reviews and ordered the product. The first week in a half i was applying it incorrectly, so i looked at the e-mail the company sent me directly after the purchase, and they show you exactly how to apply it. Been applying it twice a day correctly for about a week, so 2 1/2 weeks total and now the puffiness under my eyes is really diminishing. Liking the results so far!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice so much of a difference in my under eye bags, but the skin definitely felt tighter when I was using the moisturizer so I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this purchase. I just wish I could get rid of these god awful Italian under eye circles ... but that would require a miracle or new genetics I think... either way,  it&#x27;s a good eye cream!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is very thin and I cannot see any difference that it makes.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;I have spent so much money on eyes creams but never got a result back.&lt;br /&gt;This is THE only cream that really made a difference my wrinkles are gone and my dark circles are almost gone!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. I have been using it for almost  weeks now, and  it is magic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing good results within the past few days after using 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The puffiness is gone and the dark circles are basically just lingering, depending on&lt;br /&gt;how much sleep I get thru the week. aeoundI try and monitor in mid afternoon since I know mornings aren&#x27;t the&lt;br /&gt;true reflection of the condition and I have seen a change in appearance later in day. The lines around sides&lt;br /&gt;have been diminished, so overall I like what I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this produce for a short time but can already feel the benefits.  The price was affordable and it seems to be good quality plus the customer service has been appreciated!</li>
    <li> I have tried every over the counter eye cream and moisturizer, none have done what this product has.  The very first time I used it, within a few hours, the puffiness around my eyes was decreased tremendously (I don&#x27;t have dark circles). I have been using it for a week now and even used it on my entire face.  You can feel your skin tightening, but for me the end of puffy eyes was the main reason for my purchase.  My husband actually commented that he liked my makeup, meanwhile, I didn&#x27;t change a thing except I used this cream.  I am so happy with MezmerEyes, A MUST BUY!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update they changed the formula and packaging it does nothing now. Still just as puffy as ever n no tightening at all. Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> When applying the cream in the morning, it would cause my concelear or foundation to flake. I&#x27;d have to wash my face and start over without it. For that reason, I can only use it at night. So far I&#x27;m not seeing a difference in puffiness or dark circles. When it&#x27;s applied, it fells stiff around my eyes so I was hoping that it was helping but so far there&#x27;s no big change.</li>
    <li> Questionable .... it&#x27;s not my go-to, but I do keep it in my makeup kit in case iI forget in the morning.  It does feel good, tho.  When I apply, iI pat on until tacky then push upward ... just feels like it opens my eyes up a bit</li>
    <li> The pump came to me broken - - so I now have to unscrew the top and shake the lotion out.  Not very convenient. .</li>
    <li> Was using my wife&#x27;s eye cream trying to get rid of bags and dark circles under my eyes.  Worked ok, but then I got Mezmereyes just to try it as it was reasonably priced.  I must say after only about 2 weeks of using just a little under my eyes, morning and before bed, I have seen a noticeable difference.  My wife even asked if she could try it.  The company is great to work with and the product works.</li>
    <li> Just does not work.  Not even a very good moisturizer leaves a white film?  Will not buy again asking for refund</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember verbatim what I  previous wrote, but I&#x27;m still very pleased with the noticable improvement of my dark circles and bags under my eyes. After only 1 week of nightly application, I saw my darkness get lighter, and also filled in the deep creases around my nose. I&#x27;m a 63 year old woman, who has tried almost everything to slow down the creases and frown lines that come with aging. Using this product along with exfoliating old skin will improve and even slow down the age process. I recommend this product and any other age defying product this company sells.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! It leaves the skin around my eyes so soft! I put it on at night before bed and when I wake up in the morning, my skin feels so great! At it doesn&#x27;t come off while you sleep, it stays on all night! It&#x27;s not a large bottle, but it lasts because you only need a tiny amount and that&#x27;s enough for both eyes!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see much difference after using the cream for several weeks.  Maybe a little less red under my eyes.  I doubt I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I ordered MezmerEYES eye cream based on the claims by the seller, Protege that it would brighten up the eye area and reduce those nasty dark under eye circles. Well, after using this product twice a day for the past two months, I just don&#x27;t see my dark under eye circles lessening a bit. What I do like about this product is its ability to penetrate the eye area quite smoothly, reduce some fine lines and firm the eye area a bit. I truly wasn&#x27;t thinking this product would be the &#x27;end-all-type-of eye cream / treatment&#x27; but, I was looking forward to a lighter, brighter looking under eye area. However, with that being said, I have found that this company, Protege, really stands behind their products 150+%. They have phenomenal customer service from the moment you order their products and it takes the form of diligent email communication, which includes detailed instructions on how to use and apply their products to any type of feedback (positive or negative) you would like to give. With their &#x27;no-questions-asked&#x27; refund policy, trying any of their products gives the customer confidence that you can buy and try their products without any risk.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t written a review on amazon yet so here it goes.....I bought this as an add-on item hoping it did something and I swear it is the best eye cream I have ever used.  I am a product junkie and try different brands all the time and I really feel like this is hands down the best eye cream I have used.</li>
    <li> Did not work to reduce puffiness but I did not really expect it to (just hoped it would after the rave reviews I read). First couple of uses, it dried out the undereye area. Then it stopped. I felt a bit of a warmth immediately after putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;Did not really do anything at all. I stopped using it regularly after 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now and have seen some improvement, but it is definitely not a cure all.&lt;br /&gt;My dark circles are a bit less, I don&#x27;t have a lot of sinus problems which usually cause this, so I&#x27;ll keep using for improvement to see how it goes...usually 1 month to 2 to see any real improvement.</li>
    <li> If you are looking to tighten your fine lines, this is it. Protégé also offers other skin care products too, they seem to be spa grade. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> It has a cooling, soothing effect around the eyes.  It is easy to pump a small amount out at a time.</li>
    <li> This cream is gentle and effective if used as directed.  I can see noticeable difference in reduction of puffiness which is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It is so refreshing and does wonders for my eyes.  I will continue this product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I tried it because I have slight bags.  No noticeable change whatsoever.  Since they weren&#x27;t bad to begin with, I loaned the rest to a friend who has dark circles under her eyes and she has not noticed a difference either</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have discovered this eye cream. At 58 years of age, I needed a little more help in the baggy eyes and droopy lids area. Short of a little &amp;#34;nip and tuck,&amp;#34; which I am not inclined to do, using MEZMEREYES is the next best thing! From the very first application, it has made a dramatic difference in the appearance of my eyes. It is truly like a magic eraser. Now after several weeks of usage, I feel I can recommend it 100%. Please note: the instructions for application of the cream is really important. Some reviewers have commented that it seeps into the eyes and I must say, if applied properly and as directed, that never happens. They are probably using too much and applying it too close to the eyes. Follow the diagram clearly showing the proper way to follow the orbital bone line above and below the eye. That said, it is hard to get just the right amount of cream out of the bottle. I addressed this with Protege when they asked for my feedback in an email, and they say they are working on another delivery method, such as a jar or a tube. They are a great company and value their customers input. One last thing, I believe my vision has improved with the &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34; results I get above my eyes! And the affordable price is what drew me in to read other reviews and consequently make my purchase. It makes it worth a try!</li>
    <li> product does lighten the dark eye circles. Eyes appear better, skin more supple and moisturized..Will purchase product,again and do recommend the cream.</li>
    <li> I am only using this product at night but so far it seems to be working. my dark circles from allergies seem to be less.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been two weeks since I got it, the pump only worked for the first couple of uses and it stopped. I tried everything including turned it upside down, shake it...none worked. Now I have to open the cap and use something to dig it out, hard work makes me didn&#x27;t notice how the results are so far... will see.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m into my third week using this product and am starting to see some results. I do have to say, that I would give this seller&#x27;s customer service a 10, if I could. Within a week of receiving my order, I got an email from them checking to see that it was received and to let them know how it was going. It was too soon to tell for sure with the product, since they state in the description that it takes approximately 4 weeks to see results. A week later they checked in with me again. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever received such stellar customer service from any company, and that alone is a huge selling factor for me. They stand behind their products with a 365 day return policy, which is unheard of. I could not be more impressed, and I&#x27;m not easily impressed. Other companies could take lessons in customer service from these folks!  I will soon be buying other products in their line. There&#x27;s absolutely nothing to lose - 100% satisfaction guaranteed.</li>
    <li> This stuff not only didn&#x27;t make a noticeable if at all difference in my eye area, but it lays dry on top of the skin making it look dry and loose.</li>
    <li> The seller e-mailed me after I received the product and outlined how it was to be used, which I thought was over and above any seller I have ever dealt with.  They do truly care about the customer and they stand behind their product, which I find amazing. This product is for dark circles, wrinkles, etc. and comes in a very nice package.  I wanted it for puffiness in the AM due to allergies and after reading the instructions and e-mailing the seller I noticed that it was to be used at night or in the AM with SPF which I am allergic to.  I decided it would not be the right product for me although the reason I bought it was from other buyers who had given it great reviews.  If you have dark circles, wrinkles, etc. I am sure it would work for you.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference the first time I used it.  Some background: i have always had dark circles under and around my eyes, since I was a kid, and I usually meed a heavy concealer to hide them.  I applied the cream as instructed and I noticed that the next morning the circles were a couple shades lighter.  Skin around the eyes feels soft.  I didn&#x27;t get the tingly sensation the company talks about, and didn&#x27;t get any running into my eyes.  I was quite happy with this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this eye cream for a few days and I do see and feel it tightening the skin around my eyes upon application. I do feel that it will dry my skin out with regular use so I apply my MK timewise eye cream over it during my night time regimen.</li>
    <li> Pice of junk. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It will do thing but feel sorry yourself. I bought this because of 5 star review but seems to be paid. I used this for 66 days got worst then I was to my eye bags. So think 10 times before u buy</li>
    <li> I  love the product and the way the company is so professional. I recommend this for under the eyes for every night or day. I also recommend this for women who have had fillers, when there are days when my around my eye are is fuller than it usually is I just put some of this around the area and it brings it down. takes about 20 to 30 minutes. You do need to wash the product away after it dries because is not smooth.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s like glue that flakes off. Made my wrinkles worse.</li>
    <li> Great product! Delivered as promised. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I am 43 with sun-damaged fair skin. I wanted something to reduce puffiness and smooth out fine lines. This product is not a miracle-worker, nor is it plastic surgery in a bottle, but I am pleased with the results: puffiness is greatly reduced and the skin is much smoother under my eyes. I have tiny white dots under my eyes from sun damage and one was raised enough that I had considered having it removed. That is no longer necessary.This product smoothed it out and it&#x27;s no longer visible. I like how this product goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my eyes. I can actually feel it working, so to say, right after I apply it. There is a slight cool sensation and, when it dries, the skin feels tighter. Make-up goes on smoothly after application.</li>
    <li> I have another cream I have used.  Thought I&#x27;d try this and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the effect I was looking for.  Just average, not exceptional.</li>
    <li> It is very good, I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> Was pleasantly very surprised by this product. Usually I spend a fortune on La Prairie, Lancôme etc and I thought I would give this one a try. I&#x27;m almost 50 and have been using it twice a day. Within the first week I noticed a difference. The skin around my eyes seemed brighter and tighter. Would recommend this product to anyone who wants a good eye ( around the eye!) cream</li>
    <li> Very good.Nothing has worked for me except this</li>
    <li> I am not certain this is what I need to help the drooping eyes.  Perhaps I need to use another product of yours.</li>
    <li> I have finished my first bottle and have bought my second one.  It really has lightened the dark circles and softened the wrinkles around my eyes.  I apply this, wait a few minutes and apply an eye cream over it.  It&#x27;s one of my new favorites!!</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t care for this cream. I applied it according to the directions, but the next morning noticed my eyes more &#x27;crepey&#x27; than before, even appearing to have finer lines just under the bottom of my eye lid. I figured my eyes weren&#x27;t at the stage where I &#x27;needed&#x27; this much advanced help, so I gave it to my mom, who loved it. But when I ran out of my night time eye cream, I decided to give this another try - this time I avoid going too far into the under eye area and target the laugh lines. So far, I like it. I would love to see if this really does help with dark circles, but I&#x27;m afraid to place it under my eyes for fear that my skin will look less tight, so for now I use it sparingly, but for the price, and the fact that it&#x27;s got wonderful natural ingredients, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am mesmerized by MezmerEYES ;) see what I did there? haha :)&lt;br /&gt;I am 27 years old and starting the preventative anti-aging/skin care routine and I have what people call &amp;#34;tired eyes&amp;#34; which only hurts my feelings...alot.. It would be where if I went to work and didn&#x27;t have makeup on they would assume I was sick/hungover or tired.. when it was never the case. But after using Protege MezmerEYES for a few days I started to notice the dark circles reduce and the amount of tiny fine lines start to decrease. I dont look as tired anymore and cant wait to see how my results progress over time :)&lt;br /&gt;I put this cream on once before putting on my makeup and once again before bed, it absorbs quickly, not greasy. High quality product. :) I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Good product but not pleased with the pump. Trying to squeeze out a small amount is difficult. The pump delivers too  much cream and I end up wasting some.</li>
    <li> After a few uses, I think that I look more awake and rested. It works well, even on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> When I first started using the product I loved the cool feeling beneath my eyes. After two weeks of the product my circles began to look red and very itchy. It felt I had a sunburn under my eyes and eye lid. They began to shrubble up and itch even more to the point I had to start treating my circles with aloe Vera. Now I just have this product laying around since I&#x27;m scared to use it again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything to my eye bags,  it&#x27;s a horrible produc.</li>
    <li> Used for 4 weeks and see no improvement. Think I might want a refund.</li>
    <li> ITS SMOOTHING AROUND EYES</li>
    <li> Great product! Results after 3 weeks?</li>
    <li> Best  eye product that I have ever used.It actually works.Client for life</li>
    <li> This product is a waist of money. It flakes and does nothing it said it would. I can&#x27;t even use it till it runs out its so bad!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many eye products in an attempt to find something to reduce the puffy pockets below, and in the inner creases above, my eyes.  This is the only one that has made any difference.  Won&#x27;t say it eliminates the puffiness, but it does help.</li>
    <li> This product did not seem to work at all for me, rip-off.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in about 10 days!</li>
    <li> I have not been using long enough to see a difference. Will update my findings later&lt;br /&gt;!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my morning eye puffiness more than moisture.  It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  Really helps reduce the appearance of bags - and fast.  Not overly greasy and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent value for the price.</li>
    <li> I received my first shipment with skepticism as nothing ever seemed to work for my puffy bags under both eyes. I am amazed at the success I&#x27;ve had in just a few weeks of application. The puffiness has gone down noticeably.  I will always have some issues as I suffer from sinus and allergy problems but I can say that this product has cut the eye bags 70-80% and no other product has done that for me. The skin around my eye areas looks fresher and younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You MUST follow the directions and use sparingly and in the right way as they describe in their &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; information.  I love, love, love this product and have ordered more recently to continue the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for creating such a great product and thanks also for being so responsive to my recent comment/question about the pump delivering too much product sometimes.  I&#x27;m so glad to hear that you listen to you customer&#x27;s feedback and are working on a solution to be rolled out soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you are skeptical as I was...take a chance but don&#x27;t expect results if you don&#x27;t use faithfully 2x a day and in the way they tell you to apply it.</li>
    <li> Does nothing to the puffiness, send it back!</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream. I am 59 and started getting circles under my eyes and a bit of a bag under one. Within a week of using this eye cream I saw improvement and it just kept getting better. I plan to continue use of the cream. I had tried some others, but this one truly works.</li>
    <li> Nice jail, would not purchase again though.</li>

    <li> Was not impressed with any of the products that I purchased from this company. This eye cream in particular caused an allergic reaction resulting in a mass of cystic acne all around the orbits of my eyes, which have taken a month to clear up. I&#x27;ve never had this experience before with any other beauty product, so I have no idea which ingredient(s) caused this type of reaction for me. Only good thing about this company is they have a hassle-free refund policy.</li>
    <li> This product has done nothing for me.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> DIDNT WORK LIKE IT SAID</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS EYE CREAM IT MAKES MY EYES SOFT AND BRIGHT WILL DEFINITELY PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I have noticed over the last several years that I have started to get bags under my eyes, so I have tried multiple products, none of which have worked.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about a week or so, and it hasn&#x27;t completely fixed my problem, but I CAN SEE a big difference.  Even the skin around my eyes feels tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t thin and runny like a lot of products like this are, it is nice and thick, and it has no real odor to it.  I am looking forward to long term results of this!  I received this for free, and this is my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I applied this cream as instructed and after one day my eyes looked terrible!  My under eye area appeared to be very crepe-like and it made my eyes (and me!) look about 10 years older!  I tried for several days to use the product, thinking my skin would &amp;#34;adapt&amp;#34; to it, but my eyes continued to look awful and the skin around them was very, very dry.  In all fairness, this may just be the way I reacted to this product, but that being said, I certainly don&#x60;t plan to use a product that produced the opposite effect of what it&#x60;s intended to do!  I have never had an adverse reaction to facial products in the past.  Hope other customers have more luck than I did!</li>
    <li> Excellent! This is my second bottle!</li>
    <li> Awesome Awesome Awesome...</li>
    <li> This actually surprised me. I didn&#x27;t think it would do anything but It made the fine lines under my eyes smooth out easier. I could also feel the serum tightening my skin almost immediately after applying it. I&amp;#34;m 24 years old with hereditary dark, hallow purple lines under my eyes and I&#x27;ve been looking for products that actually work. It also lasted quite some time for me. I used for about 3 months and the bottle still wasn&#x27;t half empty yet. I followed the instructions on the back that said to apply only a small pea size on your pinky. That&#x27;s all you need. If you apply this on your crows feet or mouth lines however, the serum will make it feel weird. It tightens and kinda feels like its drying a little too quickly but it does work. I need to order me another soon actually. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so very pleased and excited that this is the FIRST eye cream to actually work for me! I had last year 2 separate MRI&#x27;s for medical diagnosis and because I have upper and lower permanent eyeliner it must have migrated and within days it caused horrific eye bags! I was beside myself and started shopping for anything to work! I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ve spent in the high hundreds! Then I tried one more time and found this product line on Amazon! When I received the bottle I was amazed that in about a two weeks it had minimized them down dramatically! My only mistake is that I was putting it down too far near the lower orbital bones and I ended up having some wrinkles there. I&#x27;ve been using my wrinkle cream down there which helped! I am so satisfied that my eyes look so much better! And my husband actually said the other morning that I looked rested! Win win!</li>
    <li> I have been using MezmerEyes for over two weeks and cannot see any difference.  I still have puffy eyes and dark circles.  Am so disappointed as I have been very careful to follow directions for its application. It does feel good, though.</li>
    <li> I have bags under my eyes and this does make a difference.  I would recommend</li>
</ol>
