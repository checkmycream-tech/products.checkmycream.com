    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. This brush holder is stylish and durable. I like to keep my brushes in the bathroom, so I wanted to protect them against moisture. Some of my brushes are too short, but that&#x27;s because they are not professional and came in the package with different shades and liners. Overall, the floral design is very pretty, the quality is great and I would recommend this holder!</li>
    <li> I seriously have WAY too many makeup brushes and I have been storing them in a big ziplock bag. I know it&#x27;s horrible but I just had no where to. Put them to keep them protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited to try this out because I can store all my brushes neatly and they will be protected my dust. It snapped together nicely and hold a good amount. All of my high end brushes fit in here perfect. The material on the outside is very thick so there is no need to worry about it ripping.

    <li> I adore this case. I travel so often that it&#x27;s hard for me to find a sturdy, reliable holder for my brushes. This one is perfect! It&#x27;s cute, and it holds up well in a suitcase. At home, I unsnap the two halves and I have two brush holders in one!</li>
    <li> This is a very cute and functional makeup brush case! It was a little bigger than I expected but will be great for travel and may be able to hold a few more items.</li>
