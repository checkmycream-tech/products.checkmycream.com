      <li>My best friend told me about Wink and how much she loved.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love, love, love Wink!  </li>
      <li>I waited to write a review because I wanted to use it to see if it would help as I had lost most of my eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Also the top of the wand cover always separates .</li>
      <li>I love that it is made of ingredients you can read and pronounce-not</li>
      <li>This also became a go-to birthday gift for friends :)</li>
      <li>My lashes, both top and bottom are visibly fuller and longer.  </li>
      <li>How are you supposed to be able to apply twice a day??</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to continue use regularly to get the best results--</li>
      <li>I try so many different beauty products that I love when I find a great one.</li>
      <li>It is so easy to use</li>
      <li>This is a great product and effective, but can be made at home for a fraction of the cost (literally for less than $1), using a mixture of products like castor oil, vitamin E oil, almond oil, and gingelly oil.  </li>
      <li>So just make sure you apply consistently!</li>
      <li>Thanks you for an amazing product.</li>
      <li>I got it for my family members last year and they are all happy with the results as well.</li>
      <li>It has taken my nearly non existent lashes and turned them into long and lovely lashes that look beautiful with mascara on!  </li>
      <li>And kudos to smart girls in science--we need more of you.</li>
      <li>It does make your eyelid nice a soft.  </li>
      <li>It would be nice if they made the product in the same way you use fingernail polish...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten into the habit of applying it right before bed after I wash my face and after a couple weeks I noticed my eyelashes looked fuller and healthier.</li>
      <li>Apply it at night right after removing make-up</li>
      <li>I have been applying the product consistently for about 3 weeks, missed a day or two, but have noticed my eyelashes have grown longer and fuller.</li>
      <li>, then again first thing in the morning.</li>
      <li>My eyelashes are definitely thicker and look more defined without mascara.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s only gotten better since then.</li>
      <li>I love the natural ingredients because I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>but if you&#x27;re patient and continuously apply the product as directed, positive results will follow.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try something natural, and though I was skeptical at first, this is really an awesome product!</li>
      <li>I think my lashes may be slightly more plentiful, but it&#x27;s not much of a noticeable difference.  </li>
      <li>Yes, the product really works.</li>
      <li>I went through two tubes of this because I really wanted it to work, but absolutely zero results.</li>
      <li>lift weights, breakfast, get dressed, do hair, organize what I need for the day; very last thing is to massage it in again, add an eye make-up primer (which is important, because this is oily) and make-up, and head out the door.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for about 4 months now and am amazed with how much my eyelashes have grown.</li>
      <li>It works so much better than any other lash enhancer on the market, and believe me I have just about tried them all.  </li>
      <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth the money, but I&#x27;ll continue to apply it and hope for a greater change.</li>
      <li>If I used it two times a day, it did cause some mild eye irritation, and definitely resulted in slimy glasses.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t afford to waste all of this product so will not be able to buy anymore.</li>
      <li>I have used one full container (old design) and finally ordered the new one (bought from Amazon this time instead of Grommet).  </li>
      <li>and I recommend it to anyone who is less than thrilled with their current lashes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It stimulates growth, so you have to give it time to see the new lashes as they grow, and to see the improved length as lashes grow longer.</li>
      <li>This is my third one and haven&#x27;t really sen much improvement on my eyebrows .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all natural and my eyelashes could use some help...</li>
      <li>I tried the product just to see if it worked and was so surprised to have eyelashes again.</li>
      <li>This company sends whatever crappy old stock they house on their shelves.</li>
      <li>In fact, I have had several people ask if I was using a new, thicker mascara because they could tell a difference (</li>
      <li>I tried this product after reading an article in our local paper about this young entrepreneur.  </li>
      <li>They were damaged from wearing individual lashes and I wanted something to help get them back to &#x27;normal&#x27;.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t a miracle growth serum (lets be honest, sometimes our expectations are unrealistic)</li>
      <li>Several users said it didn&#x27;t work for them but noted that they only used it once a day--if yoiu don&#x27;t use as directed, don&#x27;t be surprised</li>
      <li>I applied Wink in the morning and at night pretty much everyday for 3 weeks now</li>
      <li>so you have to click it a few times and then it dispenses to much!  </li>
      <li>when that happens I just slow down the maintenance dose even more than what is recommended.  </li>

<li> Took a few weeks</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I waited to write a review because I wanted to use it to see if it would help as I had lost most of my eyelashes.  It is definitely helping.  Sometimes the oil is a little slow coming out of the tube.  Wink arrived on time and in great condition.  Thanks you for an amazing product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. However this version has a wide brush, as opposed to the eyeliner-sized brush I had previously and which I prefer for less messy application.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost two years now and I can say it has worked wonders on my lashes! I got it for my family members last year and they are all happy with the results as well.</li>
    <li> Wink is an incredible product! I have been using it for about 4 months now and am amazed with how much my eyelashes have grown. I was previously using Latisse, but it was really irritating my eyes so I decided to stop. My best friend told me about Wink and how much she loved. I decided to give it a try because I was missing my long lashes. I was so happy with the results, and even happier with the price compared to Latisse. I have already recommended Wink to my mom and a few girlfriends and they are all just as obsessed with it as I am. I try so many different beauty products that I love when I find a great one. Wink is the best eyelash growth product. Stop overthinking it and just add it to your cart now, you won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
    <li> I tried this product after reading an article in our local paper about this young entrepreneur.  It&#x27;s all natural and my eyelashes could use some help...so, I gave it a try, and over a year later, I am still a happy customer!  My lashes were noticeably thicker, darker and longer, after using it nightly for about 2 to 3 weeks......yay!!  They&#x27;ve continued to be improved using what I consider a &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; schedule of applying it 3 or 4 nights a week.</li>
    <li> Zero stars if I could!. The serum is housed in the equivalent of a mascara tube with a push pen delivery system to dispense the product onto a brush at the tip. The pusher is broken since the tube is completely sealed, the entire system is useless. It arrived broken like this in a shabby, tattered, and ripped box that looks nothing like the picture. The box pictured is blue and the box I received is brown. This company sends whatever crappy old stock they house on their shelves. My advice is to save your money for another retailer other than One Stop Shop Inc. because any type of cosmetic product is non-refundable.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed.  Wink did not work at All.  I used it religiously as directed...nothing</li>
    <li> Been using this for over a month and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.</li>
    <li> This was almost dried out when I received it and what did come out made my eyes burn. Horrible product.</li>
    <li> This irritated my eyes, so had to be returned.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this works, as when you use it, it&#x27;s so oily, you can&#x27;t wear makeup, and your eyes are all greasy. How are you supposed to be able to apply twice a day??</li>
    <li> It was difficult to get the product &amp;#34;primed&amp;#34;. I contacted them and was told it takes 30-40 clicks to get the air out. This is not stated in the instructions. It would be nice if they made the product in the same way you use fingernail polish...just dip the tip in and apply. That way you would know that you have the product on the tip. With the click pen, it takes a long time for the product to reach the tip. I do think it has helped my lashes grow longer and I ordered a second tube.</li>
    <li> Really great product! I love the natural ingredients because I have very sensitive skin and it does not irritate my skin. I&#x27;ve gotten into the habit of applying it right before bed after I wash my face and after a couple weeks I noticed my eyelashes looked fuller and healthier. Gave it to my mom as a gift and now she&#x27;s hooked too!</li>
    <li> Wink has been the greatest thing to happen to my eyelashes!  It has taken my nearly non existent lashes and turned them into long and lovely lashes that look beautiful with mascara on!  It works so much better than any other lash enhancer on the market, and believe me I have just about tried them all.  I love that it is made of ingredients you can read and pronounce-not scary sounding ones like many of the other products out there.  My lashes on Wink can get almost long enough that they need a trim-when that happens I just slow down the maintenance dose even more than what is recommended.  All in all this has been nothing but a life changer for me-thanks Wink team!!</li>
    <li> Did nothing!!! Sucked</li>
    <li> I hate to write this review because I actually like this product. I have used one full container (old design) and finally ordered the new one (bought from Amazon this time instead of Grommet).  I was very happy to see a brush, thought it would be better but boy was I wrong!  I push on the button the bottom (you have to do it A LOT) to get it started and then all of a sudden it just comes flowing out!  Then it is just dripping down the side and getting all over the place.  There is such a waste of product and I couldn&#x27;t get it to stop!!  I thought that once I had finally gotten it to work, then it would come out in controlled portions each day that I use it but NO, it never dispenses just a tiny bit (which is what is needed to put on your eyelashes).  One push on the button gets no product to come out so you have to click it a few times and then it dispenses to much!  I wish they would change this dispenser.  I can&#x27;t afford to waste all of this product so will not be able to buy anymore.</li>
    <li> This product gave no results ,using Vaseline would have been more productive - gave one star as unable to give less .</li>
    <li> Well I just threw this away. I never could get the dispenser to work.</li>
    <li> This product works if you use it at least twice a day. Several users said it didn&#x27;t work for them but noted that they only used it once a day--if yoiu don&#x27;t use as directed, don&#x27;t be surprised if it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stimulates growth, so you have to give it time to see the new lashes as they grow, and to see the improved length as lashes grow longer. If you don&#x27;t use it for a day or so your lashes won&#x27;t &amp;#34;thin out&amp;#34; (unless a lot of your lashes suddenly fell out, which you&#x27;d notice), but the growth won&#x27;t be increased or as noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really need to use it at least twice a day, which can be difficult. I&#x27;m never seen in public without eye  make-up. I don&#x27;t leave the house without eye make-up; heck, I don&#x27;t even want to leave the bathroom without make-up! So here&#x27;s what I do: Apply it at night right after removing make-up (it&#x27;s a bit irritating so I put in Refresh eye drops at night), then again first thing in the morning. Leave it on for a few minutes, then massage in. Then I do my morning routine: lift weights, breakfast, get dressed, do hair, organize what I need for the day; very last thing is to massage it in again, add an eye make-up primer (which is important, because this is oily) and make-up, and head out the door.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product (not through Amazon) on a whim to see if it works, and yes, it does. I have been applying the product consistently for about 3 weeks, missed a day or two, but have noticed my eyelashes have grown longer and fuller. They were damaged from wearing individual lashes and I wanted something to help get them back to &#x27;normal&#x27;. I plan to reorder.</li>
    <li> I applied Wink in the morning and at night pretty much everyday for 3 weeks now and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed results.  My eyelashes are definitely thicker and look more defined without mascara.  Very happy with Wink.</li>
    <li> I saw a definitely change in the amount of lashes that I have after using this! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month or so. The other thing I don&#x27;t like is that if you forget to apply for about 2 days (or nights, I should say) I feel like my lashes thin out again. So just make sure you apply consistently!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for thinning eyebrows. Took a few weeks but finally they started filling in.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I read an article in our local Indiana paper about a girl who was a science whiz who found this mix of ingredients that helped eyebrows and lashes grow. I tried the product just to see if it worked and was so surprised to have eyelashes again. Yes, the product really works. Love, love, love Wink!  And kudos to smart girls in science--we need more of you.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and effective, but can be made at home for a fraction of the cost (literally for less than $1), using a mixture of products like castor oil, vitamin E oil, almond oil, and gingelly oil.  Look up homemade eyelash growth serums online - you will get the same results without spending $39 on something you can make in minutes in your kitchen! 2 stars because the product DOES work, and it works well, it&#x27;s just not worth the money at all.</li>
    <li> Been using it 3 weeks now (I think).  If I used it two times a day, it did cause some mild eye irritation, and definitely resulted in slimy glasses.  I think my lashes may be slightly more plentiful, but it&#x27;s not much of a noticeable difference.  Using just before I go to bed works best for me.  It does make your eyelid nice a soft.  Not sure it&#x27;s worth the money, but I&#x27;ll continue to apply it and hope for a greater change.</li>
    <li> I started using wink about 6 months ago. I have very thin blonde hair - including my eyelashes and eyebrows. It takes time but after continuous use, I have experienced a noticeable change in the number of eye lashes and eyebrow hairs I have. In fact, I have had several people ask if I was using a new, thicker mascara because they could tell a difference (which I was not-I have been using the same mascara for over a year probably). Anyways- I would definitely recommend this product. It isn&#x27;t a miracle growth serum (lets be honest, sometimes our expectations are unrealistic) but if you&#x27;re patient and continuously apply the product as directed, positive results will follow.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wink for about a year now and I have seen the results. I only use the product on my lashes and they were noticeably fuller after a month of use. It is so easy to use and I recommend it to anyone who is less than thrilled with their current lashes.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something natural, and though I was skeptical at first, this is really an awesome product! I saw fuller lashes after 5-7 days and it&#x27;s only gotten better since then. I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 months now. It&#x27;s important to continue use regularly to get the best results--I use every night before bed and have yet to forget, I&#x27;ve just made it a part of my nightly routine. This also became a go-to birthday gift for friends :)</li>
    <li> I went through two tubes of this because I really wanted it to work, but absolutely zero results.</li>
    <li> it works.  be patient and keep at it.  rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day.</li>
    <li> This is my third one and haven&#x27;t really sen much improvement on my eyebrows . A bit disappointing . Also the top of the wand cover always separates . It is a bit flimsy .</li>
    <li> I have been using Wink for over a year.  My lashes, both top and bottom are visibly fuller and longer.  I do not notice any loss in lashes if I do not apply daily.  Do not forget to use you lash curler to show off your great lashes.</li>
