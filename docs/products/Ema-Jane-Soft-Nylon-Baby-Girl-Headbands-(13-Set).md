      <li>These are really cute.</li>
      <li>I thought they were appropriate for newborns</li>
      <li>These are just the material of panty hose, which I love about them.</li>
      <li>I really LOVE the material the headbands are made</li>
      <li>However, I didn&#x27;t absolutely love these nylon headbands.</li>
      <li>so I decided to buy more.</li>
      <li>There are so many colors I can always find one to match her outfit and bow.</li>
      <li>They would be perfect for a newborn or preemie only.  </li>
      <li>I am extremely pleased with the quality of the products, the price, and the speed of delivery.</li>
      <li>My child isn&#x27;t even able to wear them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure you will have spend well over $14.</li>
      <li>they are cute alone without a bow</li>
      <li>They came out very cute, and everyone had fun.</li>
      <li>In fact, they&#x27;re almost a bit big for my baby, and they fit my 3-year-old perfectly.</li>
      <li>This &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; nylon is more like a cheap pair of panty hose cut up.</li>
      <li>I think it will fit better soon, though, and probably fit for a while, since it stretches.</li>
      <li>They are super cute</li>
      <li>Can dress up a little girls outfit perfectly</li>
      <li>The headbands fit with plenty of stretch and room to grow.</li>
      <li>and they fit her head.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They are cheaply meshy stuff  </li>
      <li>/&gt;-The ones that did fit and she has worn have now fallen apart.</li>
      <li>Cute colors but only good for one time wear.</li>
      <li>Super cute, SO soft, so many colors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Very soft and fit my 3 month old great.</li>
      <li>Now that she&#x27;s a bit older, more of the headbands fit but</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s okay only because I haven&#x27;t been able to use them yet.  </li>
      <li>Love the colors, so vibrant.</li>
      <li>Unlike other headbands that leave a mark on my baby&#x27;s head, these are super soft and fit great without hurting her.</li>
      <li>Only one of them has kind of pulled apart where the ribbon wraps around the head band</li>
      <li>I tried the bow on a different color in the set and it fit fine.</li>
      <li>These are nice, but kind of thin material.</li>
      <li>Most of them were pretty big for my newborn at the time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to purchase a hot glue gun</li>
      <li>It is soft nylon, reminiscent of hosiery, and seems comfortable and cute.</li>
      <li>love using these when I don&#x27;t necessarily want my daughter looking frilly.</li>
      <li>These are super soft and comfy and don&#x27;t leave any marks on my little ones head, love price and how many you get,</li>
      <li>Too large for my newborn, but will be good in a few months.  </li>
      <li>Super cute, but way too big for our 3 week old.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty much like panty hose material with ribbon hot glued on.</li>
      <li>She may not be able to wear them long.</li>
      <li>They run quite large</li>
      <li>My daughter has a 13&amp;#34; head and these are way big, probably about 14&amp;#34; around or more (a measurement in the description might help clear up some sizing confusion!).</li>
      <li>My poor husband hid one of them because he thought he broke it, LOL, but I showed him another one that fell apart.</li>
      <li>Very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are just a little big on my 1 month old, but they&#x27;re adorable and have so many colors they&#x27;ll match anything I have in her closet.</li>
      <li>of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that hey would be too large for my 2 month old, because they were stretched out on cardboard panels for shipping, but they shrunk right down and fit comfortably on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>She has a 14.5&amp;#34; head, and these fit, but on the loose side.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend these.</li>
      <li>When she grows into them a little more</li>
      <li>Two of them did fit, but there shouldn&#x27;t be inconsistencies with the set.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, these give more variety in color and allow for longer use since once baby&#x27;s hair is long enough to put up or clip.</li>
      <li>I received these headbands today and was pleased with the quality and fast shipping, but they are way too small.  </li>
      <li>the ones that fit her first are too tight now!</li>
      <li>I thought they&#x27;d be more like the old style head band (a little thicker than these) with a loop on them to slide a hair clip</li>
      <li>I know they&#x27;ll be able to fit and stretch without being uncomfortable for her head.</li>
      <li>But they are very soft and stretchy.</li>
      <li>Not small at all.</li>
      <li>I loved the other set I got, this one is a complete mess.</li>
      <li>If they won&#x27;t fit on my little 14 pound baby&#x27;s head then I have no idea how that customer squeezed them on a 4 year old.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted a headband set that I could attach different bows/flowers to and a set that wouldn&#x27;t leave a mark on my baby&#x27;s head.</li>
      <li>I bought these for my 3 month old.</li>
      <li>I purchased a pack of soft nylon headbands and a set of bow clips to go on them.</li>
      <li>Her head size is normal but the bands are way to big.</li>
      <li>The description should definitly state \\&quot;new born\\&quot; only.</li>
      <li>My baby is two months old and they&#x27;re still too big.  </li>
      <li>Quality was okay but not great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are a little more plain than I had anticipated.  </li>
      <li>My little girl still doesn&#x27;t have much hair</li>
      <li>I can understand the nylon getting stretched but this was not due to stretching.</li>

<li> , my daughter is 3 Months old with average head size.</li>
<li> The quality was decent but, again, small.  </li>
<li> but I fixed it myself with a little glue.</li>
<li> My daughter has a large head but these bands seemed really small!  </li>
<li> She was 5.6 lbs at birth, so finding headbands to fit her itty bitty head was difficult.  </li>
<li> As long as she doesn&#x27;t wiggle her head against something, it will stay, but she can still get it to go over her eyes if she does.</li>
<li> I have a 6 month old girl and they will not fit on her head.  </li>
<li> Her head is on the larger side, and these are still too big for her and slide down in her face.</li>
<li> Still probably won&#x27;t last very long due to size and the rate at which kids grow.  </li>
<li> I see my eight month old as a baby and had I known how small these headbands were gonna be</li>
<li> I read a lot of the reviews that said these were too small, but I went ahead and ordered them for my 5 month old.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received a nylon headband as a baby shower gift and I absolutely loved it so I decided to buy more. However, I didn&#x27;t absolutely love these nylon headbands. They aren&#x27;t as stretchy and are way too big for my baby&#x27;s head</li>
    <li> I really LOVE the material the headbands are made of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that hey would be too large for my 2 month old, because they were stretched out on cardboard panels for shipping, but they shrunk right down and fit comfortably on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a little more plain than I had anticipated.  I would have preferred a small bow instead of just a strip of ribbon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s okay only because I haven&#x27;t been able to use them yet.  My baby is two months old and they&#x27;re still too big.  I thought they were appropriate for newborns but maybe by baby&#x27;s head is small.</li>
    <li> I received these headbands today and was pleased with the quality and fast shipping, but they are way too small.  I have a 6 month old girl and they will not fit on her head.  They would be perfect for a newborn or preemie only.  The description does say for newborns and small babies, but I was mislead by the other customer review which said she bought them for her 4,3 and 1 year olds.  If they won&#x27;t fit on my little 14 pound baby&#x27;s head then I have no idea how that customer squeezed them on a 4 year old.  I&#x27;m wondering if she may have written the review on the wrong product.</li>
    <li> Way to big for my baby&#x27;s head. Poorly made.  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> My daughter has a large head but these bands seemed really small!  The quality was decent but, again, small.  I gave them to a friend with a newborn who was 7 lbs at birth and they fit her head.  Still probably won&#x27;t last very long due to size and the rate at which kids grow.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Best headbands I have found yet. They are perfect for my 3 month old. Her hair is very fine and these so not pull it out or leave marks on there head like a lot of other head bands do. Would highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> Great and doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my newborn&#x27;s head.</li>
    <li> Very cute. Can dress up a little girls outfit perfectly</li>
    <li> These are super soft and comfy and don&#x27;t leave any marks on my little ones head, love price and how many you get,</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my unborn they are perfect for a newborn. She may not be able to wear them long. But they are very soft and stretchy. I can&#x27;t wait to put them on her.</li>
    <li> Too large for my newborn, but will be good in a few months.  Quality was okay but not great.</li>
    <li> I only rated these down a star because the ribbon across them doesnt leave a space to attach a bow. I bought these because my little one doesnt have enough hair to put a bow in. It looked like the ribbon on these would allow me to change out bows however, when I run a clip through it, it snags on the nylon. they are cute alone without a bow but not what I wanted them for.</li>
    <li> These are just the material of panty hose, which I love about them. They are just a little big on my 1 month old, but they&#x27;re adorable and have so many colors they&#x27;ll match anything I have in her closet. When she grows into them a little more I know they&#x27;ll be able to fit and stretch without being uncomfortable for her head.</li>
    <li> These are really cute. Not small at all. In fact, they&#x27;re almost a bit big for my baby, and they fit my 3-year-old perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 3 month old. I love all the colors you get, and they didn&#x27;t leave marks on her head.</li>
    <li> These headbands are adorable! Yes, they are simple headbands.. yes, you could probably make them yourself, but by the time you bought 13 different colored fabrics I&#x27;m sure you will have spend well over $14. My daughter has a 13&amp;#34; head and these are way big, probably about 14&amp;#34; around or more (a measurement in the description might help clear up some sizing confusion!). I can&#x27;t wait until she grows into them!</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m wrong but I read newborn and baby .. I see my eight month old as a baby and had I known how small these headbands were gonna be I would not have bought them. The description should definitly state \\&quot;new born\\&quot; only. I now have all these headbands that I can litttterly wear around my wrist .. Disappointed .. I wish I would of read the last rating ..</li>
    <li> Super cute, but way too big for our 3 week old.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; nylon is more like a cheap pair of panty hose cut up. They snag on any little thing...bow, hang nail, rough spot on your finger that you didn&#x27;t even know was there before handling these. I thought they&#x27;d be more like the old style head band (a little thicker than these) with a loop on them to slide a hair clip/bow in if you wanted to change it up. Well the loop part was there but even some of those are so tight that it&#x27;s hard to get a clip through. NOT worth the price!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted a headband set that I could attach different bows/flowers to and a set that wouldn&#x27;t leave a mark on my baby&#x27;s head. I bought a different set from ema jane and I love it! So when I found this one, I bought it as well. But, they have become a waste of money:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I was worried that they would be too small as other reviewers had stated, but ours was opposite! Most of them were pretty big for my newborn at the time. Two of them did fit, but there shouldn&#x27;t be inconsistencies with the set. I can understand the nylon getting stretched but this was not due to stretching. Now that she&#x27;s a bit older, more of the headbands fit but the ones that fit her first are too tight now! Very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The ones that did fit and she has worn have now fallen apart. She does not wear these a lot, maybe once a week, yet the glue that holds the ribbon part together has fallen apart on 3 of them. My poor husband hid one of them because he thought he broke it, LOL, but I showed him another one that fell apart. Looking at them, there was hardly any glue holding the pieces together anyways, so they&#x27;re bound to fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Some of them have glue in awkward places on the ribbon where it&#x27;s impossible to get a bow/flower clip through. I tried the bow on a different color in the set and it fit fine. Frustrating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They really need to rethink their quality control because this was awful. I&#x27;m going to purchase a hot glue gun so I can fix the ones that fell apart and redo the ones that are so poorly done. I loved the other set I got, this one is a complete mess.</li>
    <li> Love the headbands! Very soft and fit my 3 month old great. I will purchase more when she out grows these.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my newborn daughter. She was 5.6 lbs at birth, so finding headbands to fit her itty bitty head was difficult.  These are perfect for a newborn.</li>
    <li> Not the best.. W&lt;br /&gt;They are cheaply meshy stuff  does not stay on the child&#x27;s head well. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend d.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of the reviews that said these were too small, but I went ahead and ordered them for my 5 month old. Her head is on the larger side, and these are still too big for her and slide down in her face. They are super cute and I know she will grow into them.</li>
    <li> These are nice, but kind of thin material. I don&#x27;t think I would get them again. There is every color you could need! And They do the job!</li>
    <li> My little girl still doesn&#x27;t have much hair and I use these all the time to add bows to her hair. There are so many colors I can always find one to match her outfit and bow. Only one of them has kind of pulled apart where the ribbon wraps around the head band but I fixed it myself with a little glue. The type of matieral is sheer and stretchy and a few of mine have stretched out so they aren&#x27;t very tight around her head but they still work. I actually prefer this type of material over other head bands I have because they don&#x27;t leave red marks on her sweet little head!</li>
    <li> The description states they are for babies, but that&#x27;s not true. My child isn&#x27;t even able to wear them. Her head size is normal but the bands are way to big. Was disappointed that she is going to have to wait for her head to get bigger before she is able to wear them after what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Not for newborn head. They run quite large</li>
    <li> I purchased a pack of soft nylon headbands and a set of bow clips to go on them. I am extremely pleased with the quality of the products, the price, and the speed of delivery. Unlike other headbands that leave a mark on my baby&#x27;s head, these are super soft and fit great without hurting her. Similar items in department stores cost an outrageous amount. In my opinion, these give more variety in color and allow for longer use since once baby&#x27;s hair is long enough to put up or clip. You have the option of using the bows without the headbands as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For size reference, my daughter is 3 Months old with average head size. The headbands fit with plenty of stretch and room to grow.</li>
    <li> Cute colors but only good for one time wear. Not durable at all</li>
    <li> Love love love!!! These headbands are absolutely perfect for my 4 month old!! Love the colors, so vibrant. PERFECT!!</li>
    <li> I just got these for my newborn girl. She has a 14.5&amp;#34; head, and these fit, but on the loose side. As long as she doesn&#x27;t wiggle her head against something, it will stay, but she can still get it to go over her eyes if she does. I think it will fit better soon, though, and probably fit for a while, since it stretches. It is soft nylon, reminiscent of hosiery, and seems comfortable and cute.</li>
    <li> Super cute, SO soft, so many colors.&lt;br /&gt;I love using these when I don&#x27;t necessarily want my daughter looking frilly.</li>
    <li> I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered these I could have made them myself. It&#x27;s pretty much like panty hose material with ribbon hot glued on. Some was so tight around the material that I couldn&#x27;t get a bow through and had to rip it off and redo it myself</li>
    <li> Good price and very cute. I used these in a baby shower to make headbands with clip on thingy. They came out very cute, and everyone had fun. They are a thin material but very soft babys head. Sorry I cannot review on how they actually worked on the baby&#x27;s head because she is not born yet! :3</li>
