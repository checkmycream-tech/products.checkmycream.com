      <li>It is my favorite sent and arrived in time and as promised.</li>
      <li>Distinctive and sophisticated?</li>
      <li>Sure.</li>
      <li>This does lack Azzaro for Men&#x27;s perfect combination of subtlety and projection (its easier to underspray or over spray), but on the whole I can make this last all day and keep me smelling great without slapping anyone around me in the face.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing this cologne for many, many years.</li>
      <li>I love this men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
      <li>I love it just what he wanted</li>
      <li>The price is extremely reasonable, the bottle is unique and really cool looking the scent is sophisticated and uniquely wonderful.</li>
      <li>Its not too pricy for 1.07 oz smells good last more than 4hours on myskin! :)</li>
      <li>I first bought it for my husband 18 years ago and it is still his favorite!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too strong or too faded.</li>
      <li>Drakkar is nice, but its a cacophony (also Drakkar is MUCH easier to over-apply).</li>
      <li>Unique?</li>
      <li>The ladies there loved me, and they could not get enough of the cologne.</li>
      <li>Sweet smelling perfume.</li>
      <li>Loved it from the beginning, then a couple of days later the bottle slipped my hands and shattered on the tile floor: what a bummer!</li>
      <li>It quickly became my go to scent.</li>
      <li>best&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly the ladies love it possibly even more</li>
      <li>So this is one of my two favorite spray on colognes and highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I love pretty much everything about Cerruti 1881.</li>
      <li>Fresh?</li>
      <li>That way I can keep the smell unique to me (at least among my group of friends and loved ones).</li>
      <li>My package arrived on time it was undamaged and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I first purchased 1881 while on holiday in Australia.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I first used Nino Cerruti when I traveled to Rome.  </li>
      <li>I was doing quite well with the women, until I left the magic bottle in a Las Vegas hotel room.</li>
      <li>I first bought this on our 25th anniversary in Bermuda .</li>
      <li>Absolutely.</li>
      <li>I guess I could say its slightly similar to Drakkar Noir, only better.</li>
      <li>; And I have a new bottle.</li>
      <li>exact smell and makes me feel as if I&#x27;m still in Germany and younger.</li>
      <li>Wonderfully classy fragrance.</li>
      <li>My body chemistry and Cerruti Image are exactly right for each other.</li>
      <li>Azzaro is the classic fougere (which is my typically preferred style), and this is the modern fougere (or at least Cerruti says its a fougere, the notes listed are actually more similar to a Chypre).</li>
      <li>Wish they still made the old Cerutti from back in the 80s</li>

<li> There are so many things going on there that its impossible for me to pick out all the notes.</li>
<li> We can&#x27;t go back into that church, but with a little 1881, she&#x27;ll be saying &amp;#34;Oh God&amp;#34; in no time.</li>
<li> Because the cologne is so unique and because it not available in just any store, and because I&#x27;m selfish, when asked over the years what I&#x27;m wearing and where did I get it, I usually LIE and provide a different name for it.</li>
<li> But what other men&#x27;s scent can I compare the smell to?</li>
<li> According to Cerrutti its top notes are Blackcurrant, Cypress, and Bergamont, its heart notes are Ylang and Patchouli, and its base notes are Sandalwood, Pine, and Oakmoss.</li>
<li> I searched for a few years but Cerruti was not sold anywhere</li>
<li> I,ve been wearing it to work fkr a few weeks and on weekends too!</li>
<li> It is not overwhelming, even when applied liberally.</li>
<li> The combination, is really tough for me to put into words.</li>
<li> With that said, don&#x27;t buy it, it&#x27;s terrible and I really don&#x27;t want anyone else wearing it anyhow.</li>
<li> The 1881 isn&#x27;t a disappointment.</li>

    <li> I brought these fumes in Muenster, over 15 years ago, thus decided to try them out from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Same exact smell and makes me feel as if I&#x27;m still in Germany and younger.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this cologne for many, many years. My body chemistry and Cerruti Image are exactly right for each other. Because the cologne is so unique and because it not available in just any store, and because I&#x27;m selfish, when asked over the years what I&#x27;m wearing and where did I get it, I usually LIE and provide a different name for it. That way I can keep the smell unique to me (at least among my group of friends and loved ones). With that said, don&#x27;t buy it, it&#x27;s terrible and I really don&#x27;t want anyone else wearing it anyhow.</li>
    <li> Got the perfume as ordered, on time, well packed and it is indeed what I wanted - perfume that I used almost 10 years ago - still the same aroma reminding me my 20th something ;)</li>
    <li> 15 years ago I was given one 1881&lt;br /&gt;Never looked back&lt;br /&gt;The best&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly the ladies love it possibly even more</li>
    <li> I first purchased 1881 while on holiday in Australia. It quickly became my go to scent. The ladies there loved me, and they could not get enough of the cologne. Back in California, I stood out because I was not smelling like every other guy in the club. I was doing quite well with the women, until I left the magic bottle in a Las Vegas hotel room. I searched for a few years but Cerruti was not sold anywhere I looked in the United States. Until Amazon said, &amp;#34;You want that? I got it.&amp;#34; And I have a new bottle. The girlfriend can&#x27;t keep her hands off me when I wear it. We can&#x27;t go back into that church, but with a little 1881, she&#x27;ll be saying &amp;#34;Oh God&amp;#34; in no time.</li>
    <li> I first bought this on our 25th anniversary in Bermuda . Love it. I then bought it in Italy. Love it more.</li>
    <li> Cerruti 1881 was given to me almost 20 years ago by a dear aunt, for Christmas. Loved it from the beginning, then a couple of days later the bottle slipped my hands and shattered on the tile floor: what a bummer! Saw it on Amazon, and I just had to have it! Now, I keep it on my room, where there&#x27;s carpeting!</li>
    <li> I found this scent 15 years ago. Have been looking for it bravo. I love it just what he wanted</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent supplier, quick delivery</li>
    <li> I love pretty much everything about Cerruti 1881. The price is extremely reasonable, the bottle is unique and really cool looking the scent is sophisticated and uniquely wonderful. Currently I&#x27;m alternating this with Azzaro Men and Guerlain Vetiver. Azzaro is the classic fougere (which is my typically preferred style), and this is the modern fougere (or at least Cerruti says its a fougere, the notes listed are actually more similar to a Chypre). What&#x27;s in it? According to Cerrutti its top notes are Blackcurrant, Cypress, and Bergamont, its heart notes are Ylang and Patchouli, and its base notes are Sandalwood, Pine, and Oakmoss. The combination, is really tough for me to put into words. Unique? Yes. Pleasant? Obviously. Fresh? Sure. Manly? Absolutely. Distinctive and sophisticated? You bet. But what other men&#x27;s scent can I compare the smell to? Nothing I&#x27;ve experienced comes to mind. I guess I could say its slightly similar to Drakkar Noir, only better. Drakkar is nice, but its a cacophony (also Drakkar is MUCH easier to over-apply). There are so many things going on there that its impossible for me to pick out all the notes. Here I get all sorts of different combinations at different times. Even that&#x27;s probably not a complete description though. This does lack Azzaro for Men&#x27;s perfect combination of subtlety and projection (its easier to underspray or over spray), but on the whole I can make this last all day and keep me smelling great without slapping anyone around me in the face. So this is one of my two favorite spray on colognes and highly recommended. Like Azzaro for Men, this would be an amazing product at 3 times the price. This would be a great idea for anyone looking for a wonderful and distinctive cologne. And its even cheap enough that you can probably blind buy it. Frankly, I can&#x27;t think of anyone who I don&#x27;t think would appreciate this.</li>
    <li> I first used Nino Cerruti when I traveled to Rome.  It is my favorite sent and arrived in time and as promised.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome ! :) fhis fragrance smells really good. I,ve been wearing it to work fkr a few weeks and on weekends too! Its not too pricy for 1.07 oz smells good last more than 4hours on myskin! :)</li>
    <li> A lot of people have complimented me on this scent. It is not overwhelming, even when applied liberally. Although they don&#x27;t make it anymore, there is still plenty of supply. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 15 years, and it&#x27;s my day-to-day scent.</li>
    <li> Ordered it for myself since the wife loves the woman&#x27;s version.</li>
    <li> My husband is from Ireland and has a thing about buying cologne in airports . . .he loves it!  We couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere so I talked him into buying from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s very happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from this provider and it arrived on time and works great.  I would reommend using this product and provider again.  Happy!</li>
    <li> No tricks, no unisex, no flowers, this is a man&#x27;s scent and the only cologne I will wear.  This is the best price I have seen on any site and in any discount store.  You don&#x27;t even want to know the price in europe or hong kong.</li>
    <li> Always loved this one... Women dig it!!</li>
    <li> This scent is the same one my grandfather used to wear. Reminds me of what a man should smell like like.</li>
    <li> My package arrived on time it was undamaged and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Thank you. came in a timely manner. Wonderfully classy fragrance.</li>
    <li> Not as fragrant as Image!</li>
    <li> Sweet smelling perfume. I have aways loved Cerruti. The 1881 isn&#x27;t a disappointment. Now i think i should have gotten the bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this men&#x27;s cologne.  I first bought it for my husband 18 years ago and it is still his favorite!</li>
    <li> Always used 1881 perfume. I&#x27;ve always been satisfied with it. It&#x27;s not too strong or too faded. It serves the purpose I bought it for and will continue to use it in the future. No disappointments here.</li>
    <li> Smells great and not expensive for the size btl. Wish they still made the old Cerutti from back in the 80s</li>
