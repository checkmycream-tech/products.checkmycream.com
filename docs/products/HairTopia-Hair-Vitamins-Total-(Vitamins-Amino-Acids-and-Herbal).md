### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am very impressed with this product!</li>
      <li>For me, this is a VERY GOOD PRODUCT!  </li>
      <li>It grew at an incredible pace.</li>
      <li>started taking the Vitamins &amp; Minerals with water and opening up the rest, spilling them in Yogurt, mixing it in, and having a wonderful eating good time.  </li>
      <li>i think its a great product</li>
      <li>I never ever write a review for ANYTHING, but this product has made me so happy that I decided to take the time to write one.  </li>
      <li>And that was very nice.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own!     </li>
      <li>Save yourself some money and get a good multivitamin and add 5000 mcg Biotin, MSM and a good protein powder to your diet.</li>
      <li>But it is a good investment.</li>
      <li>The price here is good.  </li>
      <li>There were just too many pills!  </li>
      <li>I will buy more, every month, as a matter of fact, as I can find it!</li>
      <li>They look so healthy!</li>
      <li>amazingly they do work and will show results.</li>
      <li>These pills honestly work.</li>
      <li>To be perfectly honest this did make my hair grow alot.</li>
      <li>EXCELLENT product far better than hair infinity!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to take vitamins of any kind as they always upset my stomach, but these don&#x27;t give me any problems whatsoever.</li>
      <li>if there are any more questions.</li>
      <li>I was already taking plus many more.  </li>
      <li>By decreasing my pill intake per day I have been able to stretch the pills and it makes them much more affordable.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll blend in and make my hair look a  lot fuller.</li>
      <li>I also see more growth in the front, around my face, but it MUST be taken morning and night, or it does not seem to work.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t care about the number of pills I had to take, just to make sure I did this experiment with my girlfriend.</li>
      <li>So I thought I&#x27;d give these a go, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>but hey after a big dinner its best to do just go 2 or 3 at a time there</li>
      <li>UPDATE FEBRUARY 2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still taking this product and continue to be pleased.  </li>
      <li>I thought that if I split them into 3 doses during the day it would be more manageable.  </li>
      <li>mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Love the item.</li>
      <li>if I try to take more than two at a time.  </li>
      <li>I noticed the length when I was washing my hair, and I needed more shampoo because the shampoo wasn&#x27;t covering all my hair.</li>
      <li>woowoo :)</li>
      <li>I said to myself, like hair formula 37, that maybe I just need to give this more time, so I bought a 2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all</li>
      <li>I just turned 59 years old and my hair is great for my age.  </li>
      <li>I noticed within three weeks (not bad!)</li>
      <li>so they&#x27;re easy to take.</li>
      <li>nails grew very quickly &lt;</li>
      <li>, strong tips - and they stay buffed forever.</li>
      <li>Iv noticed my nails are really strong</li>
      <li>I make sure to always take them on a fairly full stomach.</li>
      <li>Wispy, float in the air fine.</li>
      <li>Even though my hair is fine</li>
      <li>Here is an honest review from a guy who doesn&#x27;t care about how fast his hair grows.</li>
      <li>the only con is they&#x27;re very pricey but worth it ♥</li>
      <li>Believe me, it feels like hot hell, but it&#x27;s actually healthy for you.</li>
      <li>At first, I just noticed that my hair was thicker, and I was growing more hair (like around my hairline -</li>
      <li>good product...bring it back</li>
      <li>Based on my results, I am ready to place another order for more pills.  </li>
      <li>I would shower and the drain would be full</li>
      <li>It also made my chest hair and stomach hair grow rather quickly as well.</li>
      <li>and also, the herbal supplement made me break out in a rash at first!</li>
      <li>But I thought it would be worth it to give it</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth looking into.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>its worth the money just one thing</li>
      <li>So I tucked them away safe in the knowledge that I was far away from the expiration date and had some time to try again.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I decided to make the investment because at this point I had tried everything and if it helped at all, it would be worth it.    </li>
      <li>Right around the 2 month mark I felt my hair was growing faster.</li>
      <li>I am an asian with very easy hair to maintain but did not see my hair grow faster.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I cut back to half the dose to save money, but best results occur when it is used as recommended.  </li>
      <li>After two months of taking Hairtopia not-so-regularly, I have seen some pretty powerful evidence of it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
      <li>and right now its february first</li>
      <li>Pure nonsense!</li>
      <li>And when you take one pill a day from each bottle instead of 3 not only is it healthier but the pills last longer lol.</li>
      <li>Take this review for what it is, a guy that doesn&#x27;t care about how fast his hair grows, and reports the success of that product gave him.</li>
      <li>and I get a lot of compliments when I hot roller it.  </li>
      <li>to all of the people complaining 10 pills a day is too much - get over it!</li>
      <li>Been taking it for a couple of months now, and it&#x27;s most definitely working for me.</li>
      <li>and i put a nailpolish color on and watched it recede because my nails were growing so fast!</li>
      <li>This actually does show a notable difference in hair growth and thickness.  </li>
      <li>Okay, now the gross stuff: they make you burp!</li>
      <li>I got a hair cut exactly four weeks ago</li>
      <li>The only advice i would give is to not take as many pills as it says to take.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t trust too many things that say they will help you do this or that in a short amount of time.</li>
      <li>Try &#x27;em out, and if they don&#x27;t work for you you can always just send them back! :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;So try that if you&#x27;re interested in this product.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I wanted my hair to grow out and fast!  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll first notice a change in your nails.</li>
      <li>Nice pink nail bed</li>
      <li>I was super diligent about taking the full recommended dose for the first two months, but I have gotten more lax about it lately.</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference and was a bit discouraged.  </li>
      <li>do an easy wash out that&#x27;s not too different from your color, but i had dyed hair and it made it sooo much easier to see the results - it REALLY WORKS!</li>
      <li>This product might just work for others, which it has, but it certainly didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>She also noticed that in one spot in my hair my hair would grow to a certain point then start breaking with Hairtopia</li>
      <li>So the flyaway look is one short-term downside to the hairtopia pills, but my hair is undoubtedly getting thicker, my nails grow fast and my skin is currently pimple free(:</li>
      <li>I took it for like 3 weeks straight</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also growing in much thicker and healthier.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommended!</li>
      <li>I still think it&#x27;s growing just as fast.</li>
      <li>There was so much hair loss</li>
      <li>I noticed my nails growing much faster after 2-3 weeks.</li>
      <li>It also (immediately) made my fingernails grow twice as fast as they used to.</li>
      <li>, they really work,</li>
      <li>Maybe it is really for maintaining the hair, not for growth.</li>
      <li>and I cut my hair somewhat and its blending in very well.    </li>
      <li>My girlfriend did show some hair growth, but not as fast as mine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a trade off really.</li>
      <li>and my hair was shiny, long and strong.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This actually does show a notable difference in hair growth and thickness.  Keep taking it, or the results stop as well.  For me, this is a VERY GOOD PRODUCT!  As I get older (+ side of 50) my hair has been thinning, and growing more slowly.  This product s reversing that and my hair is growing in almost an inch and a quarter a month.  I also see more growth in the front, around my face, but it MUST be taken morning and night, or it does not seem to work.  O tried once a day, to save money, but I am back to morning and night.  The price here is good.  I will buy more, every month, as a matter of fact, as I can find it!</li>
    <li> My hair is thinning in the front. I bought this package and hoped that it can help a little bit. I followed the instructions and 4 pills with breakfast, 4 pills with lunch, and 2 with dinner. After 3 weeks, I have not seen any difference. Surprisingly, I did not have any of those side effects other reviewers previously mentioned, like fast growth of nails. I feel bad about the money that I spent on this thing. Maybe it is really for maintaining the hair, not for growth.</li>
    <li> These pills honestly work. I started taking them about 5 months ago when I wanted to grow my hair out fast, and after a few weeks there was noticeable growth. I was still a little skeptical whether the growth was due to the pills or just time, but I decided to pay the large amount of money and continue to take them because my nails and skin both looked really healthy too. After probably a month and a half of taking the pills I noticed little hairs sticking up along my hairline, which at first i thought were frizz and was really frustrated trying to figure out how I&#x27;d caused so much breakage. I then realized that the hairs weren&#x27;t breakage but just new hairs that are growing all over my head. These hairs are annoying right now because theyre a few inches long and are impossible to keep down, but once they&#x27;ve grown out enough I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll blend in and make my hair look a  lot fuller. So the flyaway look is one short-term downside to the hairtopia pills, but my hair is undoubtedly getting thicker, my nails grow fast and my skin is currently pimple free(:</li>
    <li> These hair topia pills are nothing but garbage! Pure nonsense! Trust me, I know this because I used to buy them. I first bought these pills last year in June 2005 after hair formula 37&#x27;s unsuccessful promise of producing longer and stronger hair in the four months of usage. Well, these pills were not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned, and had promised also to change dry and brittle hair to long and healthy, and it did absolute NOTHING. I said to myself, like hair formula 37, that maybe I just need to give this more time, so I bought a 2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no difference at all. This product might just work for others, which it has, but it certainly didn&#x27;t work for me. I must admit that I brought this on myself, as my mother warned me not to buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that grows naturally anyway, and that if you really want to get hair pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores like Giant or even hair vitamins in the damn Dollar Store! These hair growth pills are too damn expensive, so when you are paying all of that money then you expect it to work. The fact that it does not is infuriating because $39.99 + $7 in shipping, with a total of a little over $46, is a lot of money to spend on something that does nothing. Thus, I am here to warn others not to waste their precious money. And if you are going to, please don&#x27;t do it on this site-you can buy this product a little cheaper at hairboutique.com.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try these pills out because I was desperate to grow my hair back after a terrible uneven haircut. I took them for one month and unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement with the rate of hair growth. My hair did grow- but no more than usual. These are too expensive and 10 pills a day is too many. They were not worth the money and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them. I will just stick to my regular multivitamin and wait for my hair to grow. Being impatient cost me over 50 bucks!</li>
    <li> Been taking it for a couple of months now, and it&#x27;s most definitely working for me.</li>
    <li> If you want your hair to grow long and grow fast then this is it. It&#x27;s one down faulty is you have to take allot of pills in one day but the pills work. My hair is growing long and thick</li>
    <li> I would HIGHLY reccommened these vitamins for anyone. My hair genetically grows at a slow rate and is hard to take care of. My hair is much healthier and vibrant, and I saw a difference with in 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Yes, it works. Like many other people, I switched to Hairtopia when H37 did nothing for me. You&#x27;ll first notice a change in your nails. Heck, it even did something for my eyebrows. Hair growth I noticed within three weeks (not bad!) But BE CAREFUL when taking The Vitamin And Mineral capsules; they have Niacinamide in them, and this will cause your ears to burn blood red and your whole face and neck to heat up like an oven. I learned later, after a night of panic and a cold shower, that this is called The Niacin Flush, which can last for 30 min to an hour. Believe me, it feels like hot hell, but it&#x27;s actually healthy for you. Just be ready for it, and NEVER EVER take these pills on an empty stomach!</li>
    <li> I was very dissapointed with this product, especially for the amount of money i spent on it.  I did not see any difference in my hair growth at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually a very skeptical person and I don&#x27;t trust too many things that say they will help you do this or that in a short amount of time. But these vitamins actually do work. It takes some time and they are pretty expensive but they work. So if you need something to help your hair grow you should buy these vitamins cause amazingly they do work and will show results. The only thing I hate about the product is the price. But if you have money and want help with growing your hair then you&#x27;re in luck. I&#x27;m young and I don&#x27;t have alot of money so I can&#x27;t buy these vitamins all the time. But if you have a steady cash flow then you&#x27;re in luck and they will totally help you.</li>
    <li> I bought the hairtopia with the herbal supplement for 2 reasons: 1: to make my hair stop falling out and 2: to make my hair grow faster.  I have SLE (lupus) and when your disease is \\&quot;active\\&quot; it causes your hair to thin and fall out and break easily. i wanted to stop or slow this down. I have been taking Hairtopia for approx 3 weeks now. i have not noticed my hair getting ay longer ( my hair is extremely extremely curly) but it has stopped falling out and breaking off so easily. i am actually going to order another batch to continue with it.  i think its a great product</li>
    <li> UPDATE FEBRUARY 2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still taking this product and continue to be pleased.  Nothing else works as well.  I just turned 60 and am still getting compliments on my thick mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Love the item. I have used HairTopia off an on for several years.  Sometimes I cut back to half the dose to save money, but best results occur when it is used as recommended.  I went back to the recommended dose around Christmas.  My hair is growing at about 1/2-inch per 5 weeks now.  I can tell by the gray.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that the little hairs on my temples are growing better.  They had started to break off.  My fingernails are growing thicker and stronger now, but the ends are still splitting because, since your nails only grow about 1/10-inch per month, it takes awhile for the strengthened nails to replace the weak ones.  Once the new growth reaches the tips they will be extremely hard.  I just turned 59 years old and my hair is great for my age.  It&#x27;s down to below the middle of my back and I get a lot of compliments when I hot roller it.  Taking HairTopia Total has made all the difference.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on external products that say they help  your hair grow.  The only way to help hair and nails is by taking nutritional supplements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TWO YEARS AGO:  I&#x27;m 57 years old and have taken Hairtopia Total off and on for a couple of years.  If I take it regularly for a few months it makes a BIG change in the strength of my nails.  If I stop taking it my nails grow out weak and brittle.  You&#x27;ve got to remember that it doesn&#x27;t act on old growth, only new hair and nails, so it does take awhile to see results.  Even though my hair is fine I have lots of it and I get a lot of compliments.  I wear it down to the middle of my back.  No other vitamin touted as helping hair or nail growth has ever made a visible difference, but Hairtopia is the exception.  It is expensive and you have to be patient, but it does work.</li>
    <li> I never ever write a review for ANYTHING, but this product has made me so happy that I decided to take the time to write one.  When I started high school, I noticed that my hair was falling out in massive amounts!!  I would shower and the drain would be full, I would brush my hair and the brush would be full, I would dry my hair and the floor would be covered, even my pillow would be covered in hair after sleeping.  There was so much hair loss and I kept telling people that something was wrong, but they couldn&#x27;t find a problem.  After about 7-8 years of hair loss I was almost bald at 22.  My pony tail was thinner than my pinky and you could see through my hair to my scalp all around my head.  I was forced to wear hats in public because I was so embarrassed of my thinning hair.   Finally, in college, I was diagnosed with a chronic zinc deficiency.  I started to take zinc and noticed regrowth immediately.  After a few years of taking only zinc I noticed the growth started to plateau and I still had significantly thin hair.  I could still see my scalp and could only wear my hair in certain styles to try to hide the thinning.  I had tried multiple products and I was taking up to 15 different vitamins a day and I still wasn&#x27;t seeing the results I wanted.  One late night I did some research on-line and discovered the hairtopia line.  With the three types of pills I would be getting all the amino acids, vitamins, and minerals I was already taking plus many more.  I decided to make the investment because at this point I had tried everything and if it helped at all, it would be worth it.    I will be the first to admit, I hate taking pills, in fact I have a hard time and choke if I try to take more than two at a time.  The ten pill regimen was too much for me to handle.  Also being a medical student, I knew your body could only absorb a limited amount of vitamins and minerals in a day and the rest would just be excreted.  Therefore I opted to drop down to one mineral and onevitamin, plus two amino acid pills per day.  I also took a separate zinc vitamin due to my specific deficiency.  At first I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference and was a bit discouraged.  I continued to take the pills knowing that it had taken years to lose that much hair so it would probably take years to get it back.  I have been only taking the pills for about five months off and on and I can tell a drastic difference!  Now I can wear my hair any way I want without my scalp showing.  My hair is healthier and thicker!!  My nails grow faster and seem to be stronger as well.  I can&#x27;t say that my hair is growing longer, faster, but that&#x27;s not why I bought the product to begin with.  Based on my results, I am ready to place another order for more pills.  As I said before, I wasn&#x27;t even taking the pills daily and I saw results, with this next order I plan to take them daily and plan to post another review after doing so for about a month or two.  There is no magic pill for everyone.  What works for me might not work for you.  However, if you are like me and have tried everything it&#x27;s worth looking into.  The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it is a bit pricy.  Being a poor student makes it hard to afford a lot of luxuries.  By decreasing my pill intake per day I have been able to stretch the pills and it makes them much more affordable.  Also with results like these it&#x27;s worth it.  Although my hair will probably never be as thick as it once was due to follicle death from years of hair loss, I can see that hairtopia will be the product that will get me as close as possible to a full beautiful head of hair!!</li>
    <li> Had a spot in the front of my hair that had been pulled out on accident by my baby cousin, and it never seem to grow back and I was getting worried.   So before finding this product I bought GNC Mens ultranorishhair and took it for a couple weeks but it was only 2 pills a day and while it had a couple of the same ingredients in this none were close in mg.   took those for a couple weeks and while my hair grew a lil faster still nothing.  then i found Hairtopia, well im on week number 2 and I already see new hair growth and I cut my hair somewhat and its blending in very well.    A little background on my im 28 m white from Chicago blond hair that has always grew well just was so affraid that spot was done and I was going to have to go to a hair transplant place but nope Hairtopia worked for me and i just done w week number 2!  wow its worth the money just one thing it is a little hard to put down 10 pills in one sitting but hey after a big dinner its best to do just go 2 or 3 at a time there little gell caps so they go down smooth with a can of soda or water.    Ill give another review on how fast my hair grows since I just cut it to blend in w the little spot thats starting to grow hairs. woowoo :)</li>
    <li> I am an African American with very slow growing hair.  I hope in taking Hairtopia was to increase hair growth everyone was experiencing from the testimonials.  I have been on Hairtopia for three months, from February 2, 2007 to May 2, 2007 my results are as follows: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros &lt;br /&gt;My nails grew very quickly &lt;br /&gt;My hair shedding and breaking has stopped &lt;br /&gt;My hair strength became stronger from the root, and it feels thicker &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons &lt;br /&gt;My nails are still weak, break, split and chip.  As soon as they grew a little they would break, and I would never really get any length due to that &lt;br /&gt;There was no rapid hair growth of ¼ to ½ inch per month like the testimonials expressed &lt;br /&gt;There are too many pills to take in one day (10 pills daily) &lt;br /&gt;Way too expensive in my opinion to maintain the daily pill intake  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are other products out there that have the exact same ingredients as Hairtopia for less money and less pill intake per day.   I will be trying those products instead.  It does not make sense to take these pills and my nails are still weak and breaking.  For the price I paid for just the two month supply I will get pills, shampoo, conditioner, and hair serum. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t Waste your money on this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> These pills really did help my hair grow about an inch in one month, but you have to take SO many pills to see dramatic results!  I seriously would sometimes gag by how many pills I had to down.  I&#x27;m taking Viviscal now which works (although not as fast), but you only have to take 2 pills.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0002AAMYM HairTopia Total (Vitamins, Amino Acids &amp; Herbal)]]  I have few gray hair and I colored it before using this product. After 3 weeks of taking it, I did not noticed anything different (growth) before and after using it. It did made my hair healthier/shinier but the faster growth like it claim it would, did not happen. I am an asian with very easy hair to maintain but did not see my hair grow faster.</li>
    <li> I bought these pills after a horrible hair cut (I swear, the lady gave me a mullet...and I&#x27;m a girl).  :/  Anyway, I wanted my hair to grow out and fast!  So I thought I&#x27;d give these a go, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  My hair grew at least 1/2\\&quot; per month with these pills (though I think my hair grows fast on its own, anyway--but this did give it a boost).  Try &#x27;em out, and if they don&#x27;t work for you you can always just send them back! :)</li>
    <li> good product...bring it back</li>
    <li> I bought these after my stylist took a little too much length off of my hair last winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had really high hopes for this product, but after completing the entire regimen, my hair didn&#x27;t grow any faster than it naturally does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DID feel the \\&quot;hot flashes\\&quot; that everyone else mentioned... and taking that many pills in one day was really tedious. But I thought it would be worth it to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: don&#x27;t waste your money. Instead, get the \\&quot;GNC - Hair, Skin, and Nails\\&quot; supplement or the \\&quot;Phyto Plage Phytophanere Supplements for Hair &amp; Nails.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen visible results, including stronger, healthier nails from both of these products.</li>
    <li> To be perfectly honest this did make my hair grow alot. Im not really surprised because it contains alot of amino acids which help hair growth naturally anyway.  After a month of using it EVERYONE AND I MEAN EVERYONE saw the difference in the length of my hair. The only advice i would give is to not take as many pills as it says to take. They say on the bottle take like 3 pills a day from each bottle. Which really in my opinion not healthy so i only took 1 pill a day from each bottle- the aminos, herbal and the other bottle.  I took it for like 3 weeks straight and my hair was shiny, long and strong.  And when you take one pill a day from each bottle instead of 3 not only is it healthier but the pills last longer lol. But it is a good investment.</li>
    <li> When I received the package instead of having vitamins in it there was a pack of buttons! $50 is a lot of money for buttons. I called Amazon and they are suppose to refund my money but I haven&#x27;t received it yet. I am extremely disappointed cuz I really wanted to try these vitamins. How do u mix buttons up with vitamins?!?</li>
    <li> I used these vitamins a few years ago and grew a about an inch of hair with one bottle. I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep them up so I tried other vitamins on and off. Now that I&#x27;m a few weeks into one bottle I already have almost an inch of new growth and my hair grows about an inch every three months! They definitely still work and I&#x27;ll continue using hopefully for a year while I transition back to natural.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item a few years ago.  In my enthusiasm, I purchased a 3 month supply.  I was so excited when they arrived and tore open the bottles.  Needless to say after taking them for a few days.. I couldn&#x27;t take it any longer.  There were just too many pills!  I hate taking pills.  I thought that if I split them into 3 doses during the day it would be more manageable.  That did not help!  So I tucked them away safe in the knowledge that I was far away from the expiration date and had some time to try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beginning of this month (July 2013), I was desperate.  Bad perm, bad cut, hair falling out; I was at a loss as to what to do about it when I remembered them.  I found their little hiding place and saw that I had until July 2014 to use them; so I started taking them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a change to my hair.  It has become thicker in a short time and has stopped falling out as much.  However, the reason I&#x27;m writing this is to supply an answer to the pill dilemma.  YOGURT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started taking the Vitamins &amp; Minerals with water and opening up the rest, spilling them in Yogurt, mixing it in, and having a wonderful eating good time.  After all, it says on the bottle to \\&quot;take them with food\\&quot;!  The Vitamins &amp; Minerals has a slightly salty taste to them.  However, the rest of them have barely any flavor at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So try that if you&#x27;re interested in this product.  It works for me and I hope that it will work for you as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Hairtopia for about two months now. I don&#x27;t always take them twice a day, and on occasion I forget them altogether. However, I am amazed by the results. My hair has been limp, thin, and fine since puberty. So fine, that when one comes loose and lands on me, I can&#x27;t see it. Wispy, float in the air fine. I have also had thin, weak nails that would tear the second they passed the nail bed.     After two months of taking Hairtopia not-so-regularly, I have seen some pretty powerful evidence of it&#x27;s effectiveness. My nails grow so long I have to cut them back. They look so healthy! Nice pink nail bed, strong tips - and they stay buffed forever. I&#x27;m noticing tons of new hair growth all over my head as well. Yesterday, a loose hair had made its way to my chest. At first I didn&#x27;t recognize it, it was so thick &amp; the color so rich! I thought I&#x27;d somehow managed to get a friend&#x27;s hair on me. As I lifted it off of my shirt to discard it, I noticed the color &amp; texture changed from the root to the tip. At the bottom I recognized my ends - blonde from a bleach job, wispy, floating on some undetectible air current. But the root end... it was a glossy shade of red that my hair hasn&#x27;t seen since I was about 7 or so. It was so thick (for me), that I audibly gasped in amazement.     This stuff works!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my daughter and was very disappointed with the results. Her hair grew at the same rate as it normally would. It was a waste of time and money. Taking 10 pills a day and not seeing any results is frustrating.</li>
    <li> These vitamins are not necessary.  Save yourself some money and get a good multivitamin and add 5000 mcg Biotin, MSM and a good protein powder to your diet.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE!&lt;br /&gt;I used this product as described every day for 3 months and have had zero results! ...&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste you&#x27;re money on this! its a scam !!! a complete waste of money !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these for over 3 weeks.. I have not seen any new hair growth.  I think that new hair that does grow will be stronger but this has not caused my hair to grow any faster.  I would suggest just buying hair supplement vitamins from GNC or any other place you can find them.  They are much less expensive.</li>
    <li> I purchased HairTopia Total a couple months ago.  After a few weeks, I got sick of the huge regimen (10 capsules a day!) so I just started taking one pill from each once per day.  At first, I just noticed that my hair was thicker, and I was growing more hair (like around my hairline - I got little curly fine hairs that weren&#x27;t there before).  I now have a widow&#x27;s peak, and didn&#x27;t before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After about a month of using the product, people started saying to me \\&quot;Wow!  Your hair is getting so long!!\\&quot;  And that was very nice.  It also (immediately) made my fingernails grow twice as fast as they used to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  Gave four stars because of the price and unreasonable regimen.</li>
    <li> I was transforming from a perm to natural hair and did not want my hair to break off. This product did keep it from breaking, but the growth I was expecting was not accomplished as quickly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only taken this for 2 weeks so far.. but already I&#x27;m noticing a difference in my hair!  I&#x27;m not a fan of swallowing pills and theses things are fairly big so I just take one of each pill not the recommended 3 3 and 6 yuck I&#x27;m not swallowing 12 pills and this was way they last way longer and clearly it&#x27;s working for me  I&#x27;ve had friends comment on my hair growth I do recommend taking them with food taking these on an empty stomach is a no no you&#x27;ll feel nauseous I take mine with dinner I gave the product a 4 because I&#x27;m not done with the pills yet and the only con is they&#x27;re very pricey but worth it ♥</li>
    <li> Here is an honest review from a guy who doesn&#x27;t care about how fast his hair grows. My girlfriend ordered two packages by accident. She talked me into starting out the hair growth regime with her. I just did a \\&quot;yes dear\\&quot;. She put the pills into my vitamin container along with my other supplements. At first, I was shocked with how many pills I had to take. I realized that you are feeding your body extra amino acids to help promote hair growth. I didn&#x27;t care about the number of pills I had to take, just to make sure I did this experiment with my girlfriend. I started to show results immediately. I have naturally thick, wavy, curly hair. My girlfriend was shocked at how thick my hair was growing in. It grew at an incredible pace. I noticed the length when I was washing my hair, and I needed more shampoo because the shampoo wasn&#x27;t covering all my hair. I&#x27;m my girlfriend&#x27;s guinea pig when it comes to hair. She highlighted my hair a lighter blond (I&#x27;m a dark blond) and you could see how fast my hair was growing because of the highlights moving down so fast from my part. It also made my chest hair and stomach hair grow rather quickly as well. I give this product 5 stars hands down. I do agree it is a pain to take all of these pills, but how badly do you want your hair to grow? It&#x27;s a trade off really. Take this review for what it is, a guy that doesn&#x27;t care about how fast his hair grows, and reports the success of that product gave him. My girlfriend did show some hair growth, but not as fast as mine. I&#x27;m assuming everybody is different, so it will take take to work their individual systems. Please contact me at beerad1985@gmail.com if there are any more questions. Put hairtopia in the heading so I know it&#x27;s not spam...</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I&#x27;ve never been able to take vitamins of any kind as they always upset my stomach, but these don&#x27;t give me any problems whatsoever. I make sure to always take them on a fairly full stomach. They&#x27;re also softer capsules so they&#x27;re easy to take. I&#x27;ve been taking them for 83 days (almost three months). I noticed my nails growing much faster after 2-3 weeks. My hair stopped falling out as much shortly after that (I was losing a lot of hair every day). Right around the 2 month mark I felt my hair was growing faster. I got a hair cut exactly four weeks ago and I have at least an inch of growth, maybe more. I&#x27;ve been trying to go out an old hair color for almost two years and have never had my hair grow this fast. It&#x27;s also growing in much thicker and healthier. If only I would have found this sooner! I was super diligent about taking the full recommended dose for the first two months, but I have gotten more lax about it lately. I have skipped entire days a few times, ect. I still think it&#x27;s growing just as fast. HIGHLY recommended!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT product far better than hair infinity! Also takes the place of all the other vitamins &amp; minerals I have to take. The only down far is it&#x27;s expensive and can not find it locally at this time.</li>
    <li> Started using the pills March 2010. I have naturally thin hair. By May my hairdresser not only noticed hair growth but I have less split ends. She also noticed that in one spot in my hair my hair would grow to a certain point then start breaking with Hairtopia my hair has grown past that point.&lt;br /&gt;You should see results in a few months if you take the recommended amount.</li>
    <li> to all of the people complaining 10 pills a day is too much - get over it! you&#x27;re going against nature, getting your hair to grow 4x faster than it does on it&#x27;s own!     that being said, there are some things i found that no one&#x27;s mentioned here:   1. there are alot of pills, but it&#x27;s not so bad. they&#x27;re about the size of tylenol capsules, and they don&#x27;t smell or taste badly.   2. you MUST buy the complete package. as much as it sucks because of the price, the herbal supplement really makes your hair grow faster.   3. i recommend, if you can, dye your hair before you start. do an easy wash out that&#x27;s not too different from your color, but i had dyed hair and it made it sooo much easier to see the results - it REALLY WORKS! w/in 24 hours i went from about 1/8\\&quot; of roots to 1/4\\&quot; - seriously! it&#x27;s now been 3 weeks and i&#x27;m at 3/4\\&quot;.     Okay, now the gross stuff: they make you burp! not sure if it&#x27;s the swallowing or the pills themselves or what&#x27;s in them. and also, the herbal supplement made me break out in a rash at first! i had to stop taking for a week, then started again, and no rash. and lastly, they REALLY rev up your appetite. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend these if you don&#x27;t want to gain a few pounds, or if you don&#x27;t want to hit the work outs a little harder. they make me eat like crazy, especially the first week i started.     but that&#x27;s it, they really work, yeah it&#x27;s annoying, but i think the results far outweigh the hassles!!</li>
    <li> I started hairtopia January 15th 09. and right now its february first and this is what iv seen so far.     Iv noticed my nails are really strong and i put a nailpolish color on and watched it recede because my nails were growing so fast! and there is no breakage at all.    i havent noticed hair growth yet but i have noticed its thicker, shinier and looks healthier.    I dont mind the 10 pills a day its not a big deal to me its just the price i have a problem with.    -but i would recommend it but like anything else u have to be patient. your hair isnt going to grow 5 inches in a month.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product! I have not experienced any rashes or hot flashes like some have posted, and my hair has grown an inch in a couple weeks.  I died my hair blonde right before taking them (I usually get my roots done every 12 weeks), I&#x27;m on week 5 and already am in desperate need of some touchups. I don&#x27;t even mind the 10 pills!</li>
