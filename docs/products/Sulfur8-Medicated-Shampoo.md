    <li> Sulfur8 had sulfur in it at one time and it was a wonderful shampoo, why they messed with a good thing is beyond me. I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this and then found out Head &amp; Shoulders was about the same thing.</li>
    <li> My order was everything i wanted. i used this shampoo for many yrs.I was so glad to see it on Amazon.com. I been looking for this shampoo all over pennsylvania. Of course i had to order this. My order was promptly taken, and within a few days..i received my order.Thank-u for your prompt service. I will now order from Amazon all the products i USED to buy in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;Thank-u for your very good service.....Dianadee</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work that well for me as I think my psoriasis needs a stronger shampoo.  My dr. did call in a shampoo and it works well, except I have to leave it now 5-10 minutes and at times I don&#x27;t have the time to wait.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy the product again.</li>
    <li> the shampoo works great, and I love it but ship by ground or package will be soggy.</li>
    <li> If you ever get scale looking bumps on your scalp, then this is the shampoo for you. If you put it on your scalp 30 minutes before you shampoo, it does a great job. It has cleared up my dads scalp and is working on mine. The first time you shampoo you will see a difference.</li>
    <li> This Shampoo is Great for sores on the scalp my wife uses it often for that I recommend it also</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really experience a significant loss in dandruff &amp; it really makes your head stink.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> this product work wonders i must reorfer</li>
    <li> I order a sulfur8 MEDICATED shampoo and I get a sulfer8 DEEP CLEANING shampoo that is wrong</li>
    <li> Check the ingredients list -- there&#x27;s no sulfur in any form in the product.  Instead, the product contains triclosan which is all that can support it&#x27;s claim to be \\&quot;medicated\\&quot;.  Triclosan is antibacterial, while sulfur is more generally antimicrobial.  The chemicals are therefore not interchangeable.  There is no ingredient in this product that treats dandruff in any way.  Very misleading, and I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Is it me or is there actually no Sulfur in this shampoo?  It has Triclosan which according to the FDA is under review and has no health benefits aside from treating bacteria in the mouth...hm...?</li>
    <li> Excellent for oily scalp.  No adverse reactions.  Satisfied with the product.  Would purchase again. No further comments I can think of.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is good but it does not solve my skin problems....</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product. I did not like it. It was a waste of money.  It did work a little but not worth it.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is great for scalp problems and leaves my skin very exfoilated and refreshed. i like it and how it works will continue to buy it</li>
    <li> This Shampoo is very good for the hair,leaves it clean and take of the residues from your hair scalp I love it</li>
    <li> I order this for my son who has had a scalp condition for years.  His scalp breaks out in bumps, similar to pimples and they are painful.  He&#x27;s tried different shampoos, gone to different doctors, and even had bigger bumps appear.  Finally, one doctor put him on antibiotics.  He took antibiotics for more than 4 years and bought this shampoo in Dollar General and bumps went away.  Dollar General doesn&#x27;t carry it where he lives so I order it for him on Amazon.  As soon as the shampoo runs out, the bumps come badk.  He swears by this stuff!</li>
    <li> Lightning fast shipping, great product, and leaves my hair feeling fresh and hydrated, will be buying another bottle when this one is finished</li>
    <li> Good product; performs as advertised.  Delivered in good condition and a timely manner.</li>
    <li> nice shampoo  it feels really good on the scalp would buy it again recommend it very highly thanks great product</li>
    <li> This works good and has  a nice fragrance that&#x27;s not overpowering.  They don&#x27;t specify on the advertisement but this product contains triclosan for antibacterial use for skin conditions that respond to antibacterial products.  I like this better than the other antibacterial products available for this use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a very long time; it is very convenient to order it online, the price is about the same or a little less than in the local stores</li>
    <li> this price is a little high, used together with conditioner. other wise your hair will be unsmooth. very useful for hair itching.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, BUT I purchased two bottles, yes it was express but they charged me $100 not $50 for both. As This was a first time purchase using this site I did not understand this.  Now I will be more vigilant!</li>
    <li> Stopped the itching-Good stuff-they know what they are doing-have to get conditioner next time.  Worked first time.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Well, I tried this shampoo and have mixed feelings about it. It suds a lot and deep cleans but doesn&#x27;t seem to help with Folliculitis, which is a painful infection in the hair follicles, as would sulfur. I read the ingredients and sulfur isn&#x27;t even listed. I&#x27;ll continue to use the product once or twice a week for deep cleansing and a bottle last a long time.</li>
