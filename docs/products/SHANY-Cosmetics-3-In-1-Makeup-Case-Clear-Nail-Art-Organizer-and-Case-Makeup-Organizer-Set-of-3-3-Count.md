      <li>These little cases are GREAT!</li>
      <li>They are so cute and useful.</li>
      <li>These cases are super cute and very versatile!!</li>
      <li>Not only is it great for travel but good for organizing they are great for things other that makeup such as jewelry, hair accessories, nail polishes, ect.</li>

      <li>How cute and you can see thru it to make sure you have everything inside instead of having to open the case which is a neat approch.</li>
      <li>You will know exactly where each make up is located at!</li>
      <li>each case is easy to open and easy to lock (the largest two have locks)</li>
      <li>The days of fumbling through organizers for the right colors, for the right look on the right days are gone.  </li>
      <li>Almost snaps the lid off if I do not close it slooooowly and line the edges up just right.</li>
      <li>I love clear cases for my makeup, it just makes it that much easier to see what you are grabbing at instead of rummaging through drawers until you find what you are looking for.</li>
      <li>I also like the fact that you get three different sizes, making this product much more versatile.</li>
      <li>and they look so cute next to each other stuffed with you favorite shany cosmetics products!</li>
      <li>Very durable and never goes out of style!</li>
      <li>The way I can out my makeup by category makes my job so much easier!</li>
      <li>now all, I have to do is keep the key somewhere safe.</li>
      <li>I love that this comes with all three sizes because I never know how light or heavy I am packing, now I can have an option.</li>
      <li>I use one for nail polish at work (makes it easy for my co-workers to grab and go as well), and filled the other two with Christmas gifts of nail polish, and makeup stuff!  </li>
      <li>I love them the big one i can put nail polish in or anything and the other 2 are just so cute</li>
      <li>Have their own little lock.</li>
      <li>These cases are very well made</li>
      <li>Thought the largest one would work for nail polish plus, but really doesn&#x27;t hold a lot.</li>
      <li>These cases come with no makeup in there and are just clear plastic and aren&#x27;t worth $1 don&#x27;t buy at all,</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend getting these or giving as a gift!</li>
      <li>Was excited I love the sizes and the lock/key feature I have younger sibblings and they like getting in things they are not supposed too, this will deffenitely keep them out although the smalk is a bit to small</li>
      <li>Clear is cool cause when you grab something you can see what you are grabing without having to open it.</li>
      <li>I keep all these of these cases out on my dresser and they&#x27;ve simplified my morning routine; now I don&#x27;t have to dig through a draw full of random makeup - everything is organized nicely.</li>
      <li>It comes in three sizes which makes it easy to separate larger creams from tiny lip glosses from long-ish length mascara.</li>
      <li>These are great little boxes, and they are little compared to what I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>Look at these Clear Cosmetic Cases!</li>
      <li>The clear boxes let you see what you have inside.</li>
      <li>its clear</li>
      <li>and I like that they&#x27;re clear.</li>
      <li>Bought for my 4 year old girls.  </li>
      <li>It helps you keep it, well organized haha, obviously.</li>
      <li>I was surprised that the two largest had locks</li>
      <li>and i love showing it off to other people i absolutely was bouncing up and down when the mail man came saying package for me!</li>
      <li>Whether you&#x27;re an actual make-up artist or your have so much makeup that you might as well be one (I count myself in this second category)</li>
      <li>I also like the idea that it was clear so that my nieces could decorate the outside as they wished.  </li>
      <li>If I had a lot of nail polish tubes, I would get this product, because it is clear, therefore, it enables the user to see the different products at the same time.  </li>
      <li>I was a little upset that I paid so much for them, thinking that they would&#x27;ve been bigger.</li>
