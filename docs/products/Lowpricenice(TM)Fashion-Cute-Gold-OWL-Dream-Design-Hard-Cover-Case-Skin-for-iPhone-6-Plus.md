    <li> Not for my phone but I gave it as a gift</li>
    <li> Provides no protection</li>
    <li> never buy from Towallmark I never got my stuff,very convenient, it a cheap phone case, so people probably would care about $2, but I wonder how many people payed and never got the stuff.</li>
    <li> Had this on my phone not enough protection snow fell onto my phone and water got in between the case and my phone. Ended up paying $200 for a new phone due to water damage on my old phone.</li>
    <li> Not a good quality at all. Prettier in the picture for sure. 👎🏻</li>
    <li> sent me one for the plus</li>
    <li> Ordered wrong size by accident... Totally my fault!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected for the money paid.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t for an iPhone 6 or 6 plus. Not sure what phone it&#x27;s for. I would have spent too much money to send it back so I threw it away.</li>
    <li> I like the case it&#x27;s very cute</li>
    <li> Everything is excellent and thank you</li>
    <li> Totally in love with it.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it came earlier than expected and it&#x27;s really cute!</li>
    <li> Does NOT look like an authentic case. The picture online is nowhere NEAR an accurate depiction of  the actual case. Although i paid less than $5 for the case, i am not satisfied and would not get another case. It looks like someone with an unsteady hand traced the design and put it on a case. Horrible 😒😒</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> Quality wasn&#x27;t good at all</li>
    <li> So cute. I love it. It did take awhile to get.</li>
    <li> Some how order size came wrong but product overall is great!</li>
    <li> Great, affordable and useable.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the iPhone 6 Plus and received it for the iPhone 6. It&#x27;s cute but flimsy and would cost more to send it back  to China than the original $2.75 to purchase. And it took a month and 3 days to arrive.</li>
    <li> It met my expectations very nice</li>
    <li> No what I expected. Picture does look better than the case. As soon as we put it on it started fading.</li>
    <li> I ordered a iPhone 6 case &amp; received the iPhone plus case. Wasted some money and was super upset</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so pretty and slim</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this case 0 stars! I ordered for 6+ received a case for the 6! It took wayyyyy tooooo long to get here plus the case looks completely different than the picture...I would actually like my $2 dollars back if I could have it</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered this one instead of the regular 6 one so that really sucks and I don&#x27;t get to use it :( but the case is very nice but I have no use for it since its 6 plus. Good deal for price though</li>
    <li> Cute, doesn&#x27;t hinder the sound port at all... BUUUT it scratches off and looks awful in less than a week. I feel like I need a case for my case!  Wish they had printed the owl on the inside using the plastic, which does seem pretty sturdy, as a barrier.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like the picture. It&#x27;s plastic</li>
    <li> SUPER cute!!! very sleek, def not protective....i wld not use w/out screen protector. luv!!</li>
    <li> Thought item would be stronger, very cheap looking but ok.  Price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Has held up well. Slight wear along the sides. Looks great on the phone, product exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Super Super Cute!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting and I&#x27;ve never had any phone dropped out of my hand so frequently only because that case is so slippery</li>
    <li> its really cute. but be careful its not protective at all.</li>
    <li> I Want  this but it&#x27;s for iPhone 6 plus but I have iPhone6</li>
