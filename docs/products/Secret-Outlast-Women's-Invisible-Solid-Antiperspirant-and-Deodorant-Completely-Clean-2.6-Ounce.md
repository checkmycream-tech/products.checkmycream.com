      <li>Than u will be ok</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the same clinical strength antiperspirant/deodorant for years because I thought that it worked as best</li>
      <li>The product smelled nice, went on smooth</li>

      <li>And best of all, no white marks on my clothes.</li>
      <li>I am extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I think the protection is good, don&#x27;t really love the wetness when you first put it on -</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a good smell when you first apply</li>
      <li>The scent is great and even with my sensitive skin I don&#x27;t have any itchy side effect (which some deodorants cause me).  </li>
      <li>so strong you can smell them all day</li>
      <li>The strong gels.  </li>
      <li>Kept me dry, smelling good and, best of all, no white marks on my clothes.  </li>
      <li>I received this deodorant from Bzz Agent free to test and share my review.</li>
      <li>I received this free to try from BzzAgent.</li>
      <li>By 11pm that night I did the sniff test again and this time smelled nothing but the light scent of the product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find it to strong but can smell the clean scent.</li>
      <li>I got a chance to try this product and got it free.</li>
      <li>Bzzagent sent me this for free to test out.</li>
      <li>I did get to try this product for free</li>
      <li>This deodorant has a very clean and fresh smell.</li>
      <li>It has a very clean and fresh smell and I will buy it.  </li>
      <li>The smell is very strong and very fruity.</li>
      <li>I would encourage deodorant manufacturers to also look for new and more healthy ways to provide antiperspirant support.</li>
      <li>For full disclosure, I did get this free from Bzzagent to try</li>
      <li>I admittedly gave my armpits a good sniff, and just barely smelled stinky.</li>
      <li>I received my full size product and coupons through a fantastic program called BuzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was excited to get the chance of testing and reviewing this deodorant.</li>
      <li>It says that it lasts for 2 days and although I have not tested for the full 48 hours, I do know that it stands up to my workout regimen and a humid day at the polo tournament where I was moving for over 10 hours straight!!!  </li>
      <li>No chemical smell, no perfume smell, just clean.  </li>
      <li>and it seems effective as a deodorant, but the stick is very soft, almost creamy and the lid doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
      <li>This clear gel is just amazing.</li>
      <li>The odor protection is also lasting, even after going to gym and having a good sweat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is nice that the clear gel does not get on my clothing, as this happens often with stick deodorants.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no Secret that I use this stuff all the time, love how it works and leaves no residue.</li>
      <li>I was sent this as a free product from bzz agent and have been thrilled with the results!&lt;br /&gt;I am usually set in my ways when it comes to my health products, however I am thrilled I tried this.</li>
      <li>Also the scent is fresh and clean and does not have an overbearing scent.</li>
      <li>but it dries fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>The scent is this deodorant smells wonderful and it left no white marks</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how quickly this dries when applied...</li>
      <li>But if you live in a warmer region then perhaps the cool application would feel refreshing?  </li>
      <li>It keeps me dry and good smelling.</li>
      <li>I will for sure purchase in the future (NOTE this product was given to me free as part of a promotion from the brand).</li>
      <li>But I decided to give another try and this time i loaded a tiny bit on the top swiped and it felt great and not as wet</li>
      <li>I put on the Secret Outlast and hoped for the best.</li>
      <li>I was not crazy about the turn dial.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Secret is the only deodorant that works for me. I am not a hot or sweaty person, but always suffered from a bad smell under my arms. Tried tons of deodorants but this brand is the only one that works.</li>
    <li> I was sent this as a free product from bzz agent and have been thrilled with the results!&lt;br /&gt;I am usually set in my ways when it comes to my health products, however I am thrilled I tried this. It goes on clear, it dries fast, it offers better protection, no white residue on my clothes, and the price point is competitive.In the future I plan to purchase as my normal deodorant.</li>
    <li> Hi I received this from BzzAgent for me to try and give an honesty opinion of the product..The product does stay up for long last protection not 48 hour but it does last a long time specially for me I sweat a lot. I dont recommend for people with sensitivity to odor it may be a little strong. Like that it does not leave no white marks on the clothing. I only thing I didnt like was that it took a little time to absorb in the skin and it felt a little sticky but this is only until it dry. Than u will be ok</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I was selected to try this product from a brand promotion because I&#x27;ve been a fan of Secret for years.  There was a time when nothing worked for me except for Secret Platinum.  Sadly, I&#x27;m very underwhelmed with Secret Outlast.  I found that it didn&#x27;t help at all with wetness for me and odor became a problem within a couple of hours.    The product smelled nice, went on smooth and I love how clear it was, sadly, this doesn&#x27;t matter if it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I recently received the secret outlast from Secret to try out and test for free. I never wear clear gel deodorant so I was skeptical because I&#x27;m used to my solid deodorant. My first time using the Secret Outlast Gel was not a pleasant one but i think it was my fall because I loaded too much product on the top and as I swiped on my under arm area it felt wet and sticky. Foe sure I was convinced that this was not for me. But I decided to give another try and this time i loaded a tiny bit on the top swiped and it felt great and not as wet and it dried quickly. The scent is this deodorant smells wonderful and it left no white marks what so ever on my clothes. So thanks to Secret I am able to use clear gel now.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel  is great.I got a chance to try this product and got it free. I first time try it and love it because it has a great scent and it doesn&#x27;t leave a white color powder under my arm when it drys out. it drys very fast than the one i used before.it has a stronger protection from making my under arm sweat. I highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was asked to participate in Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel challenge with BzzAgent and was skeptical about using a gel deodorant because in the past have not really liked them.  Although this gel did dry slightly faster that those in the past it still was cold to the underarm area to apply and as a Northeast girl in Fall &amp; Winter any extra cold against my body is a big no-no.  But if you live in a warmer region then perhaps the cool application would feel refreshing?  The smell is average.  This product did keep my dry and sweat free for a long time at the expensive of really drying out my underarms which in order to shave, kind of need a little moisture there.  On a positive note it kept its promise and did not leave any white marks .</li>
    <li> Not gonna lie, I sweat. I sweat a lot, especially when I get nervous. Just last week I found myself in a stressful situation. I had a presentation to do in front of a room of strangers. I put on the Secret Outlast and hoped for the best. What I liked about this antiperspirant is that it worked. No sweaty underarms! And best of all, no white marks on my clothes. I didn&#x27;t even have to flap my arms up and down waiting for this to dry. I swiped it on and put on my clothes right away.    For full disclosure, I did get this free from Bzzagent to try but I&#x27;m gonna buy it.</li>
    <li> Awesome awesome awesome</li>
    <li> Works well, does what it says, quick shipping and another good buy from amazon. keeps me from stinking!</li>
    <li> This deodorant works well for controlling odor and sweat. I really like the smell and the scent lasts all day. I was not crazy about the turn dial. I fell like I had to turn it 50 times until the deodorant reached the top. Other than that, its a pretty good product. I felt more confident throughout the day. As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
    <li> Is it functional? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Does it smell like that fruity fluoride mouthwash they made elementary children swish with in the 90s? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Thus, will I buy it again? Definitely not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name of the scent is &amp;#34;Completely Clean,&amp;#34; so I was expecting maybe a linen smell or something equally light. The smell is very strong and very fruity. It, honestly, smelled like a deodorant marketed to pre-teens like &amp;#34;Tropical Ocean Explosion&amp;#34; or something. And who knows, maybe my body chemistry just doesn&#x27;t jive with this... either way, it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite one from the Secret line so far. I have tried all the other scents and types including the gels, clear stick, spray, white stick etc. This is the ONLY one that actually satisfies my needs. I do not sweat like a pig but occasionally from intense work or stress at work I tend to get perspiration so it&#x27;s a MUST for me for a deodorant to keep me dry AND smelling good at the same time. This deodorant has a very clean and fresh smell. And it smells the SAME when it&#x27;s put to work aka working on the sweat. Yes, you have to be careful how much you apply because if you overdo it, then it will rub off on your clothes and leave white marks. I put very little yet it goes a long long way. This one keep me dry and smelling great for about 5-6 hours, when Dove or Degree only hold up to 4 hours for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s no Secret that I use this stuff all the time, love how it works and leaves no residue.</li>
    <li> Works great. Not my favorite scent but it keeps me dry. Thank you</li>
    <li> this product is AMAZING! I highly recommend. I found out about it from a blog post and decided to purchase and try it for myself. I suffer from excessive perspiration and it is really embarrassing. When it gets a little hot I sweat and my deodorant wears off quickly leaving me self conscious and embarrassed. Since using this product I don&#x27;t have that problem. Even when I sweat I smell my underarm and the only scent present is the blissful scent of this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I used degree motion sense clinical strength and it did not do much of anything to help my excessive perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my holy grail deodorant. I use mine daily instead of every 48 hours do to my condition.</li>
    <li> Nice deodorant and doesn&#x27;t make me itch.</li>
    <li> The person I bought it for said it smelled good, but didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  Paid .77 cents for it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell but it&#x27;s a good quality product</li>
    <li> Keeps your pit smelling good</li>
    <li> Great product!!  I have used this deodorant for a couple of days and only I can say is that I&#x27;m hooked with it. Love the scent, fresh, the gel dries almost immediately after application and des not leave those nasty white marks on my clothes. The odor protection is also lasting, even after going to gym and having a good sweat.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant to try as a BzzAgent and absolutely love it! It definitely provides great odor protection and I&#x27;ve noticed less perspiration. I really like the scent too. I don&#x27;t find it to strong but can smell the clean scent. Hey wouldn&#x27;t you rather smell clean than stinky!! Enjoying using this sample &amp; will def switch to this deodorant for the future!</li>
    <li> I started using Secret Outlast Gel this summer because my Dove deodorant was no longer cutting it.  I also recently received one for free from Secret as part of a promotion   I am extremely pleased with the results.  Kept me dry, smelling good and, best of all, no white marks on my clothes.  I love, love, love this deodorant!!</li>
    <li> Love Secret products...this one is the best!  I can&#x27;t believe how quickly this dries when applied...It says that it lasts for 2 days and although I have not tested for the full 48 hours, I do know that it stands up to my workout regimen and a humid day at the polo tournament where I was moving for over 10 hours straight!!!  Will purchase again.  I want to check out other scents.  This isn&#x27;t my favorite but that is just a personal opinion</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to sample the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for BzzAgent.  The product does as it boasts - clear gel that doesn&#x27;t stain clothes and 48 hours of odor and wetness protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My disappointment with this product comes from its ingredients.  The active ingredient is aluminum zirconium (16%).  Recent studies have indicated a possible link between aluminum and breast cancer, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and kidney disease.  With these findings in mind, I am moving away from aluminum-based antiperspirant products.  I would encourage deodorant manufacturers to also look for new and more healthy ways to provide antiperspirant support.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this deodorant.  Not only does it not stop sweating all that well, but the smell is OVERWHELMING.  The scent does not go away at all and it&#x27;s all you can smell all day long.  I like deodorants that have a light scent that you can only smell when you lift up your arms, not deodorants so strong you can smell them all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> excellent product and brand my daughter uses most often.  fast shipping, great customer service</li>
    <li> keeps you mostly dry, keeps you stink-free for 4-5 hours intense work-out, doesn&#x27;t mar black clothes IF AND ONLY IF precautions are taken when applying deodarant and putting on various dark-colored shirts (comes right off with a mildly damp washcloth).</li>
    <li> Great Deo at a great price. One of my usual brands. Keeps you nice and dry and not smelly.</li>
    <li> I feel like it wears off faster than other secret deoderants.  Other than that is just meets my requirements for daily non-stinking.  I probably would not rebuy it.  I would rather go for Secret Vavavanilla deoderant.  I am not sure if the extra scent is what helps the Vavavanilla have staying power.  I find that this outlast one wears off faster and I feel like i need to reapply sooner because i have a little breakthrough armpit smell.</li>
    <li> I Love the secret brand so when I got a chance to review this NEW product for Bzz Agent I jumped at the chance! This product is AMAZING! It really does live up to its name... it outlasts everything! Also the scent is fresh and clean and does not have an overbearing scent. This is great for everyday use... keeps you dry and odor free!</li>
    <li> I received my full size product and coupons through a fantastic program called BuzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Secret products in the past. Even though I like the solids they always left a white residue. The gel glides on and stays on. I can instantly put on my clothes and not worry about residue or my clothes being wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret is out. Try it. I bet you&#x27;ll change your current deodorant to Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I get to run and still remain dry and not smelly.  The scent is great and even with my sensitive skin I don&#x27;t have any itchy side effect (which some deodorants cause me).  I will for sure purchase in the future (NOTE this product was given to me free as part of a promotion from the brand).</li>
    <li> I received a free Secret outlast from Bzz Agent in return for my feedback and reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always used this type of deodorant.  The strong gels.  This one is better than Mitchum for me.  Honestly, this deodorant works perfectly and doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes.  I don&#x27;t give it a second thought because I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant from Bzz Agent free to test and share my review. I was skeptical of this because I am not a fan of gel or roll on, but this stuff works great! It doesn&#x27;t have a good smell when you first apply but once it dries it is great!  I even went two days without showering on a couple occasions to test it and it was GREAT! I would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I received one of this deodorants as part of a BzzAgent campaign, in exchange of my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to get the chance of testing and reviewing this deodorant. I always had a battle and struggle with deodorants, because I have a very strong sweat and I find it hard to control it. This clear gel is just amazing. It dries fast, leaves no stains in the clothing and protects me fully. I smell fresh and feel fresh all day long. Wish I had this deodorant during my school years, when I had physical education class.</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Invisible Solid is truly what it says it goes on clear and dries quickly.  There is barely a scent.  It keeps you dry and not smelling for over 24 hours.  Also because it goes on clear there is no white marks on your clothes or beading under your arm.  I sweat all the time and use this and have no issue with body odor from my arm pits sweating.</li>
    <li> I received a sample through bzzz agent, however I had been using this deodorant prior to the sample because it was on sale at my grocery store.  I love that I never have to worry about white streaks. It keeps me dry all day, but the scent of the deodorant does not stay all day.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the smell of this deodorant!  I would wear a perfume that smelled like this (it&#x27;s not perfumey, though, just &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smelling)!  I think the protection is good, don&#x27;t really love the wetness when you first put it on - which is why I usually use a solid deodorant - but it dries fairly quickly.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks and I LOVE the smell (have I said this yet!?).  I don&#x27;t really have sweating/BO issues so it may not work well for everyone, but works for me!  I received this free to try from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> long lasting, smells great</li>
    <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean for free to test it out, as part of a promotion from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had wonderful experiences with clear gel deodorants in the past, so I was a little apprehensive to try Secret Outlast. My apprehension was quickly soothed, as I noticed that while it did go on wet....it dried very quickly. No sticky feeling at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast really does go on completely clear. There is no white mess whatsoever. You can feel confident knowing that once it&#x27;s on and dried (in seconds), you won&#x27;t have any white mess on your clothing. The Completely Clean scent is slightly strong at first, but as soon as it dries it just has a faint clean smell. No chemical smell, no perfume smell, just clean.  This is a product that I will definitely purchase over and over!</li>
    <li> Great deodorant. It keeps me dry and good smelling. The smell is pleasant without being overwhelming. Good choice in deodorant.</li>
    <li> I normally do not wear gel deodorant. I don&#x27;t like the gooey feeling of first putting it on, that&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m not giving this a 5. Bzzagent sent me this for free to test out. I&#x27;m glad they did! It lasts longer than my regular deodorant and I never was able to smell my sweat through the deodorant, which usually happens! I really like this deodorant I just wish it was a solid!</li>
    <li> I got this product from bzz agent &amp; it worked great the firstime two 2 days I got it but then I broke out or got some sort of rash &amp; had to discontinue use. I&#x27;m xtina.</li>
    <li> Bye-bye stinky, sweaty armpits! Thanks to a free sample from BzzAgent, I have been using the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for almost a week and can&#x27;t believe the results I&#x27;ve seen. First, let me just say that I sweat. A lot. Like, stinky sweat. Nervous sweat. You name it. I&#x27;ve been using the same clinical strength antiperspirant/deodorant for years because I thought that it worked as best it could for me. Clearly, I was wrong. The first day I tried the new Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel, I noticed how smoothly it went on. I didn&#x27;t need to use a lot as it covered very well. And it was dry in an instant. I headed out for a 4 mile run and worked up a good sweat. I admittedly gave my armpits a good sniff, and just barely smelled stinky. After a good shower, I reapplied and put on a black shirt. Again, it dried quick and didn&#x27;t leave one single mark on my shirt. That day I ran errands, worked in the garden and finished the day at my daughters field hockey game. By 11pm that night I did the sniff test again and this time smelled nothing but the light scent of the product. And I do mean light. No perfume-y smell whatsoever. Since then, I&#x27;ve used it everyday and told my 12 year old daughter I&#x27;m getting her one as she suffers from the same problems I do. And I&#x27;m also getting my son one also. His current brand doesn&#x27;t seem to offer him any relief and if the men&#x27;s version is anyhing like the women&#x27;s, he going to love it. Thank you Secret for finally figuring out how to make something that actually works. I will be singing the praises of the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> Feels AMAZING! I love the smell, the feel, and the fact I stay dry all day!!!</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant from Bzz agent so I could evaluate it.  After a few days of using it, I don&#x27;t see an extraordinary difference from the other products I&#x27;ve tried.  When I first put it on, it was cold to my skin and took a few minutes before it dried.  I am comparing this to a stick deodorant. By the afternoon, I noticed some wetness under my arms, but there was no odor.  It is nice that the clear gel does not get on my clothing, as this happens often with stick deodorants. The scent is also pleasant</li>
    <li> One of my favorite deodorants. It works, smells great and was very convenient to buy online. I even had a coupon which made this purchase even better!</li>
    <li> This is great deodorant for the &#x27;secret&#x27; brand.  I prefer Dove.  I didn&#x27;t feel this deodorant truly lasted 24 hours, but I would still buy it again if it was on sale.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is pretty great.  It keeps your shirts clear of those horrid white marks.  Keeps you dry and stink free throughout the day.  I did get to try this product for free and I will be purchasing before I run out of this current one.</li>
    <li> Secret is a great deoderaunt, its not over powering and doesn&#x27;t leave marks all over your clothes, its my favorite.</li>
    <li> Works like it ahould. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind the scent and it seems effective as a deodorant, but the stick is very soft, almost creamy and the lid doesn&#x27;t stay on. I couldn&#x27;t toss it in a suitcase or gym bag without risking a gooey mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning it.</li>
    <li> This is a great deodorant. It really helps with sweating and smell. I have a hard time with deodorants due to skin sensitivities and also some of them not working. This one works great and did not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> The gel is a lot different from a solid which is what I am used to using.</li>
    <li> Awesome price, great product, delivered to my door as scheduled.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product from BzzAgent &amp; thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl, but will tell you up front that I&#x27;ve used Ban deodorant for years now &amp; didn&#x27;t think this one was going to do the trick.  I, like some others on this review board, was not thrilled by the sticky, oozy stuff coming out of the bottle when I first opened it up &amp; don&#x27;t typically go in for that format when it comes to antiperspirant/deodorant.  However, I did think to wait for a few minutes before putting on my clothes, but was still expecting to see the white streak down the sweater, etc. like I usually do.  Well, to my surprise, I didn&#x27;t.  And the product worked for me (a heavy sweater), no perspiration all day long.  And it wasn&#x27;t a one or two day fluke, it&#x27;s been like this for about two weeks now.  I&#x27;m DEFINITELY going to change when it comes time to buy more, so thank you BzzAgent &amp; Secret both for giving me a new product that works for me &amp; I actually enjoy using!  Scent is nice too btw!! :)</li>
    <li> After my first week of using Secret Outlast I&#x27;m 100% shocked at how amazing it is!! I&#x27;m one sweaty chica, usually trying to fight it away buy having to apply my old deodorant 5x a day! Not any more! The new Secret Outlast is my new best friend! I only have to apply it once in the morning! Keeps me dry and fresh, not only ALL DAY, but until the next morning!! Thank you Bzzagent.com for letting me test this amazing product for free!!</li>
    <li> I got this as part of a bzzagent promotion trial to test and review. I have not been a fan of clear gels in the past, but I have to admit that they have definitely improved! Smells nice and clean, definitely no white marks, but I just didn&#x27;t like the slightly &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; feel that it left on my skin along with the fact that it takes a minute to dry. I&#x27;ll stick with my solids for now.</li>
    <li> I have so many shirts that seem to have permanent white marks in the underarm area of them because of stick deodorants.  I am not a huge fan of gel deodorants because they seem to be a little difficult to control as to how much comes out at a time.  I do love this deodorant though because it really does give 48 hour protection and it does NOT leave behind any white residue on my clothing or my skin.  It has a very clean and fresh smell and I will buy it.  I received mine for free as a promotion for Secret and I have loved using it and discovering this fantastic product.</li>
