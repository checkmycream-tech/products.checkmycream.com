### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best of all neck crèmes I have used.  </li>
      <li>wonderful product...</li>
      <li>I have used Clarins for 30 years and I&#x27;m a happy camper, no wrinkly or saggy skin on my neck (yet!!).</li>
      <li>Adds firmness and smells delicious.</li>
      <li>it was the best.  </li>
      <li>Great price and cream.</li>
      <li>It is the best cream I have found for my neck and have recommended it to others many times.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled to not have to wear scarves in the summer anymore!</li>
      <li>I noticed a bright pink-red rash \\&quot;inside\\&quot; and all along the horizontal wrinkle line on my neck (almost like a splotchy rope</li>
      <li>But it is good.</li>
      <li>If Christie Brinkley recommends it...must be good...</li>
      <li>It is a good product.  </li>
      <li>But I trust this brand &amp; hope there would be amazing effect on me.</li>
      <li>We need honest reviews and research from people who have no vested interest in the outcome.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE CLARINS !!  </li>
      <li>one day (about 3 months in) I noticed a HUGE difference!  </li>
      <li>Ok product.</li>
      <li>Pricey, but a much better price than Sephora which sells for 80.00.</li>
      <li>but no complains I will buy more ,I over 40th</li>
      <li>I love this neck cream because it has the consistency of an oily cream without the oil.</li>
      <li>After many years of use, I am still pleased with this product..</li>
      <li>+ on some more snake oil, but</li>
      <li>I have been using this cream for many, many years, i love it, it really prevents your neck to age prematurely!</li>
      <li>It is easy to smooth on the neck without dragging or stretching the skin.</li>
      <li>Soft cream gives neck area a nice smooth appearance.</li>
      <li>It glides onto the neck well and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Luckily I was able to return it to Sephora and one of the girls was surprised because she said people rave about Perricone.  </li>
      <li>right?</li>
      <li>Haha!  </li>
      <li>I was interested in trying CLARINS neck</li>
      <li>Clarins works on a &amp;#34;peaches and cream&amp;#34; complexion with absolute precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I chose the Clarins brand because I know that they strive to use pure and usually natural plant ingredients.</li>
      <li>I am new to using the neck cream.  </li>
      <li>Love the way this feels not sure if its working.</li>
      <li>I buy 50 ml of the real thing, but sold me is small kind, significantly higher price a lot, later can&#x27;t buy something in the shop, I saw the comments, many people say after using the skin rashes, sales are likely to be false, really can not be bought here.</li>
      <li>So far I like it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised Clarins would release it.</li>
      <li>67 years old, did not need a neck firming cream but thought I would try one anyway.  </li>
      <li>So far it seems to be working.</li>
      <li>I am a very youthful looking 43, but my neck has been showing signs of too much tanning for a few years now.</li>
      <li>In general, I am a fan of Clarins, and took the plunge with this creme.</li>
      <li>but in the dead of winter will be absorbed within 20 minutes for primer application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am not sure it is worth the amount of money I paid for it</li>
      <li>It seems to come down to skin type and how your body reacts to things because although some others said this Clarins stuff didn&#x27;t work for them, it REALLY worked for me.  </li>
      <li>Although it seems people are quick to write a complaint but never a praise if it DOES actually work.  </li>

<li> I like this product very much I like clarins line little expensive</li>
<li> They swore up and down</li>
<li> The crepey skin had improved by, I&#x27;d say 75-80% and that piece of my neck that had been hanging down, was tight!  </li>
<li> Just another waste of money.  </li>
<li> It created an annoying rash and that&#x27;s too much money to pay just to get a rash and some small result 90 days later.  </li>
<li> so I am not sure I would order it again.  </li>
<li> so I really thought I was an idiot to spend $80</li>
<li> It was sad.  </li>
<li> Expensive but does the job.</li>
<li> (Oh and the Perricone products also made my skin break out like crazy)</li>

    <li> I have been using this cream for many, many years, i love it, it really prevents your neck to age prematurely! It is the best cream I have found for my neck and have recommended it to others many times.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this cream yet. But I trust this brand &amp; hope there would be amazing effect on me.</li>
    <li> I was interested in trying CLARINS neck cream.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 days of use I noticed a bright pink-red rash \\&quot;inside\\&quot; and all along the horizontal wrinkle line on my neck (almost like a splotchy rope burn).&lt;br /&gt;My skin is raw, almost blistered, and is sensitive to touch.&lt;br /&gt;I took the product back to the CLARINS counter; the salesperson offered no explanation when I asked what ingredient could possible burn someone&#x27;s skin like this.&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying a topical anti-burn cream for the past 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;What is in this product?&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs down to CLARINS big time.</li>
    <li> Great price and cream.</li>
    <li> In general, I am a fan of Clarins, and took the plunge with this creme. Frankly, I felt taken. It is the most disappointing Clarins product I&#x27;ve used, and the most disappointing neck creme I&#x27;ve tried. Having fallen for this \\&quot;joke,\\&quot; I&#x27;d recommend you skip this one. I&#x27;m surprised Clarins would release it.</li>
    <li> 67 years old, did not need a neck firming cream but thought I would try one anyway.  Only minor improvements.  It created an annoying rash and that&#x27;s too much money to pay just to get a rash and some small result 90 days later.

    <li> Clarins works on a &amp;#34;peaches and cream&amp;#34; complexion with absolute precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want your chin lifted..lines to tighten ..look well rested..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a tad on the greasy side..but in the dead of winter will be absorbed within 20 minutes for primer application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will try your neck, then try your eyes, then cheeks..this stuff just works.</li>
    <li> It is a good product.  I am not sure it is worth the amount of money I paid for it so I am not sure I would order it again.  But it is good.</li>
    <li> Just another waste of money.  I&#x27;m almost finished with the jar and see no improvement at all.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I am new to using the neck cream.  So far I like it.  It glides onto the neck well and absorbs quickly.  Never sticky</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE CLARINS !!  Can see my skin on chest drink up its moisture !!  Thank you !!</li>
    <li> Love the way this feels not sure if its working. But grat price also</li>
    <li> I love this neck cream because it has the consistency of an oily cream without the oil. It is easy to smooth on the neck without dragging or stretching the skin. I have used Clarins for 30 years and I&#x27;m a happy camper, no wrinkly or saggy skin on my neck (yet!!).</li>
    <li> The best of all neck crèmes I have used.  If Christie Brinkley recommends it...must be good...right?</li>
    <li> wonderful product...I can definitely tell when I am not using it. This firms up the bit of turkey waddle I seem to be getting</li>
    <li> Reading the other reviews, I&#x27;m surprised it didn&#x27;t work for anyone else. Although it seems people are quick to write a complaint but never a praise if it DOES actually work.  I am a very youthful looking 43, but my neck has been showing signs of too much tanning for a few years now. I called it my \\&quot;turtle neck\\&quot; because it was all crepey and one part was just hanging.  It was sad.  I have NO wrinkles around my eyes or mouth, but my neck made me look 80! So  I went to buy another brand I read about in a magazine at Sephora.  While in there, I was talked into buying Perricone&#x27;s version for $120.  They swore up and down it was the best.  (A rep from Perricone was even there) After 3 months, I saw NO change and to add insult to injury, the cream smelled like I was putting rotten vegetables and feet on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I was able to return it to Sephora and one of the girls was surprised because she said people rave about Perricone.  I was not one of them.  It seems to come down to skin type and how your body reacts to things because although some others said this Clarins stuff didn&#x27;t work for them, it REALLY worked for me.  (I have olive skin, predominantly oily) I bought this thinking I will just try one jar and if it doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll try something else.  I am a total skeptic about ALL beauty products so I really thought I was an idiot to spend $80+ on some more snake oil, but one day (about 3 months in) I noticed a HUGE difference!  The crepey skin had improved by, I&#x27;d say 75-80% and that piece of my neck that had been hanging down, was tight!  I&#x27;m so thrilled to not have to wear scarves in the summer anymore! Haha!  I recommend this to all my friends!  (Oh and the Perricone products also made my skin break out like crazy)</li>
    <li> Ok product. Soft cream gives neck area a nice smooth appearance. Pricey, but a much better price than Sephora which sells for 80.00. Only using for a few weeks other than moistuerizing really do not see any other benefits. Nivea cream from Germany feels and works like cream la Mer and the cost is 15.00. You decide.</li>
    <li> Adds firmness and smells delicious.</li>
    <li> After the last brand I was using was discontinued, I decided on this. I chose the Clarins brand because I know that they strive to use pure and usually natural plant ingredients. So far it seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much I like clarins line little expensive but no complains I will buy more ,I over 40th</li>
    <li> I buy 50 ml of the real thing, but sold me is small kind, significantly higher price a lot, later can&#x27;t buy something in the shop, I saw the comments, many people say after using the skin rashes, sales are likely to be false, really can not be bought here.</li>
    <li> After many years of use, I am still pleased with this product..</li>
    <li> Just wish it didm;t cost an arm and a leg!</li>
    <li> Expensive but does the job.</li>
