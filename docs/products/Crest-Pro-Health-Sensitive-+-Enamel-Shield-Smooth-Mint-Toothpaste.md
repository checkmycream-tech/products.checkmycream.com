      <li>Its a nice concept</li>

      <li>but that&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
      <li>The Stannous fluoride is the more effective cavity reducer.</li>
      <li>Crest, why would you discontinue a perfectly good product and lose a loyal customer?</li>
      <li>Crest has always been one of my favorite toothpastes.</li>
      <li>using this toothpaste my teeth are doing much better</li>
      <li>Um...not sure.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not horrible</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I love how it visibly whitens my teeth.  </li>
      <li>I try to get it most of the time.</li>
      <li>Satisfied.</li>
      <li>I used to love crest pro health</li>
      <li>Clearly I&#x27;m pleased with these outcomes.</li>
      <li>, I find Crest works just as well as Sensodyne for a much better price.</li>
      <li>To some extent, I also attempted to rinse more so as to reduce the film&#x27;s appearance on my lips in the morning.  </li>
      <li>I was so glad to find it here.</li>
      <li>I mostly have used butler brand for many years as it was the cheapest.</li>
      <li>This is so much better than their Anti-Health version of toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I could not find butler so went with the next best price for the buck which was this.</li>
      <li>Changed my life, better than sensodyne.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite Crest flavors.</li>
      <li>I immediately noticed that my lips were chapping more</li>
      <li>sure you look into this before buying though as some have reported plastic beads inside that can get stuck in your gums (harboring bacteria)</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not for the better.</li>
      <li>And they said that this has happened to many of Crest line of products.</li>
      <li>it whitens better than sensodyne.</li>
      <li>Sensodyne or the store brand version is so much better, in comparison.  </li>
      <li>Those popular brands might work, but I surely wonder how much given how much better I&#x27;m doing now with Pro-Health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This brand works great for those of us with sensitive teeth also.</li>
      <li>I need the sensitive and this toothpaste works great at getting rid of the sensitivity.</li>
      <li>But one day saw a great sale on the Sensitive Crest Toothpaste and decided to try it.</li>
      <li>Anything to help, even a little bit, is good, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>Excellent product better formula than normal toothpaste connot get Crest Sensitive here at all in UK</li>
      <li>The shield it says it has to protect teeth to me is a really nice plus that most other brands do not have, and it makes me feel my teeth are being protected (kind of a nice feeling).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using sensitive toothpastes for many, many years now and this one in my opinion worked much better than all the rest.</li>
      <li>I am so happy with this toothpaste, finally my husband and I can share a brand.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s no longer available for sale.  </li>
      <li>Great tooth paste especially for sensitve teeth.</li>
      <li>I got this for free from BzzAgent.  </li>
      <li>It seems like most of the sensitive flavors are a very strong mint and have a tendency to irritate my mouth.  </li>
      <li>It does sting your mouth, but they all sting, this one is no worse in my opinion, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all unless I leave it in too long (which I do sometimes to get the best effect from the numbing compound).</li>
      <li>Perhaps there was some sort of allergic reaction to this but a quick google search reveals there are many other people who have experienced this.</li>
      <li>I appreciate the sensitive toothpastes more and more</li>
      <li>My teeth feel truly clean after.  </li>
      <li>I still tried to use the tooth paste as I paid for it but paid special attention to my gums/gum line.</li>
      <li>The Smooth Mint is just right though.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quick.</li>
      <li>He loves the super minty premium blaster ultra type of toothpaste that fries my tongue</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and as described.</li>
      <li>(I was also pleased that this particular product includes the Pro-Health.</li>
      <li>I think I have a mild chemical burn on my tongue from this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>It happened to me many times when I used to much of it, eventually i found the right amount where it no longer is happened</li>
      <li>It happened to me many times when I used to much of it, eventually i found the right amount where it no longer is happened</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also not thick and goofy like</li>
      <li>I like the slight grittiness to it; it makes it seem more effective.</li>
      <li>This tooth paste lasts and leaves my breath fresh for hours.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste for nearly 2-years, and my dentist tells me my teeth and gum condition fall into the top 10 percent of what he sees at bi-annual cleanings.  </li>
      <li>Leaves your mouth feeling fresh though.</li>
      <li>Besides there are plenty of whitening products out there you can purchase if your that self absorbed.</li>
      <li>It cleans well and leaves breath fresh.</li>
      <li>My teeth always felt very clean &amp; I never had any issues with sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>right when I start brushing with the toothpaste.....as I&#x27;m brushing, I can feel it penetrating my teeth</li>
      <li>I love the large flat top popup cap on it, as it makes it stand straight up saving counter space.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got some from my dentist to use so had to buy more used most of little tube up works so well on my sore mouth</li>
      <li>Hubby really likes this toothpaste because he has much more sensitive teeth than me.  </li>
      <li>Not to worry...but a little surprising.</li>
      <li>I bought Crest Pro-Health, Sensitive + Enamel Shield, Smooth Mint.</li>
      <li>My wife starting complaining about sensitive teeth, so she tried this and is sold on being a great sensitive toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>No burning, no numbness, no weird taste.  </li>
      <li>They then add some color and flavoring and a magic ingredient such as baking soda, Scope or a whitener.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Crest has always been one of my favorite toothpastes. I try to get it most of the time. I need the sensitive and this toothpaste works great at getting rid of the sensitivity. I love the most excellent price that Amazon has this at!!!! Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Changed my life, better than sensodyne. Renewed my teeth health and protects against acid.</li>
    <li> I like it. Work well for sensitive teeth. Good mint taste. Not sure about the enamel shield after my recent dental appointment....</li>
    <li> The toothpaste tastes awful. It makes me almost throw up every time i use it. It is not the same as the other Crest Sensitive toothpaste. I would avoid</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this toothpaste has those little plastic beads in it. I keep finding them in my gums and after some research, I find I&#x27;m not the only one who has that problem. Besides, do we really need billions of little plastic beads going into the environment? They serve no true purpose in the toothpaste and I&#x27;m sick of finding them in my mouth. I wish I&#x27;d tried this before I bought 4 tubes but that&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
    <li> After using the product the first time i noticed my tongue felt sort of strange but didn&#x27;t think anything of it at the time. Used it the second day to brush my teeth and upon rinsing out my mouth realized that the entire inside of my mouth was numb. This numbing sensation lasted for about 20 minutes and by the time it subsided it was apparent that it burned my tongue and mouth (chemical burn?). Two days later the side effects are still there and there is difficulty tasting some foods. I have never experienced anything like this from a toothpaste before. Perhaps there was some sort of allergic reaction to this but a quick google search reveals there are many other people who have experienced this. Highly advise against Crest Pro-Health.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this toothpaste, finally my husband and I can share a brand. He loves the super minty premium blaster ultra type of toothpaste that fries my tongue and I was using sensadyne, which seemed weak. Then we tried this one, and it&#x27;s fresh enough for me while catering to my sensitive teeth and strong enough for him. I like the slight grittiness to it; it makes it seem more effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a few years, I love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased a 7.8 oz tube of this in store at Walmart for $3.47 6/16/13 as my other brand (Colgate Sensitive Multiprotection - maximum strength) was too expensive here. I mostly have used butler brand for many years as it was the cheapest. I could not find butler so went with the next best price for the buck which was this. It does sting your mouth, but they all sting, this one is no worse in my opinion, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all unless I leave it in too long (which I do sometimes to get the best effect from the numbing compound). I&#x27;ve been using sensitive toothpastes for many, many years now and this one in my opinion worked much better than all the rest. I can&#x27;t tell if the whitening is working, but I have a feeling it&#x27;s most likely not.. as it takes much more than just a simple toothpaste to really whiten teeth. The shield it says it has to protect teeth to me is a really nice plus that most other brands do not have, and it makes me feel my teeth are being protected (kind of a nice feeling). I don&#x27;t get any film on my lips or anything like that other reviewers have mentioned, so I don&#x27;t understand what they are talking about.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the mint taste can be what is stinging, so others who are having issues may want to find a more neutral flavoring (if there even is one). This toothpaste also protects against gingivitis, plaque, cavities, and tartar; can&#x27;t beat that. I love the large flat top popup cap on it, as it makes it stand straight up saving counter space.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this product and hopefully it stays in my price budget, because I&#x27;d like to keep using it till the day I die or have to have falsies.</li>
    <li> Excellent product better formula than normal toothpaste connot get Crest Sensitive here at all in UK</li>
    <li> so supposedly this toothpaste protects your enamel! I bought this at walmart and started using it for 2 months now. This product makes a thin layered of film which is what is suppose to protect the enamel. In theory this sounds good but in reality that thin layer come off if you eat anything or even drink tea or coffee. when it comes off it feels nasty in you mouth because its all sticky and you can see the white layer.&lt;br /&gt;So if you want this thing to work you cant eat anything for at least 3-4 hrs after brushing. Its a nice concept but just doesn&#x27;t work!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months and it works great for me.  I have damange to my enamel from three years of braces and an allergic reaction to the adhesive.  This product has helped to fortify what enamel I have left.  I have extremely sensitive skin and really weird allergies to obscure ingredients, but have had no problem with this product.  No burning, no numbness, no weird taste.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I drink coffee.Beyond the usual stains from it, coffee itself started ticking to portions of my front teeth. I literally had to scraped it off with a metal dental pick. Being that I am in my 50s, I thought that maybe I was losing my enamel. I&#x27;ve used Crest since a child so I decided to try Crest with an enamel shield - mainly to see if that would help. After about a week of use, I have had no problems with needing to scrap coffee off my teeth anymore. (I was also pleased that this particular product includes the Pro-Health. I really didn&#x27;t need the &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34;, but am assuming since all else in it worked well, if I ever do end up with sensitive teeth I believe that will work just as well.)</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and I switched to Crest Pro Health Sensitive + Enamel Shield toothpaste about 3 months ago. I immediately noticed that my lips were chapping more but I thought it was just because with summer here, I was getting dehydrated. Then, when the inside of my cheeks started shredding and peeling CONSTANTLY, I mentioned it to my girlfriend and was amazed when she told me her cheeks and the roof of her mouth were doing the same thing. A little research and I found out the same thing everyone here is complaining about, it&#x27;s CREST PRO HEALTH TOOTHPASTE that was causing it. We switched to another brand and the problem INSTANTLY went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor, like I did. It took me less than a minute researching this online to find hundreds of complaints about the toothpaste doing to all those people exactly the same thing it did to my girlfriend and me. Do you really want to use a toothpaste that destroys the skin in your mouth? I was waking up in the morning with a wad of dead skin in my mouth like it was stick of gum I was chewing! It was disgusting!</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and this is the toothpaste that helps me best that is a reasonable price.  Other &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brands are just outrageous in cost.</li>
    <li> i was worried about the SLS in this. its doesnt irritate my mouth. it whitens better than sensodyne. cons: you can see my fillings now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothpaste thinking it was the same as Crest Sensitivity. Boy was I mistaken! This is the worst toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. It is extremely strong compared to other toothpastes, as it has a much higher concentration of alcohol and peroxide. This can result in chemical burn of the mouth (sloughing off of the skin in you mouth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for Crest Sensitivity toothpaste, don&#x27;t make the mistake I made and get this. This is not what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I bought Crest Pro-Health, Sensitive + Enamel Shield, Smooth Mint. I used the product for about 2 weeks and noticed a blue tinge to my gums, right beyond my tooth mark. When I got a closer look, I picked it out with a tooth pick. It is he blue specs in the toothpaste. I still tried to use the tooth paste as I paid for it but paid special attention to my gums/gum line. Every time I used it, I got those blue specs stuck in my gums and had to use a tooth pick to remove them. A couple weeks later I went to my dentist, mentioned the concern. And they said that this has happened to many of Crest line of products. They said even with all the complaints, the FDA still has not done anything about it. The dentist also said these are plastic pieces which seem to do &amp;#34;no harm&amp;#34; but there are not enough studies done, yet if you are swallowing those or getting them stuck in your gums, how do you think that will do no harm????? I am so mad about this tooth paste and any other line of crest products. NEVER will I buy anything again from Crest and I will DEFINITELY tell everyone I know about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I second what N. Terrell said. But almost EVERY time I use this toothpaste ( Used as my only toothpaste), I had the sloughing of my mouth and would have to get it out because it bothered me soo much. It felt like you had cotton mouth until you removed all the sloughing out of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18 of 20 people found the following review helpful&lt;br /&gt;A good tooth paste but beware..&lt;br /&gt;By N. Terrell on December 1, 2011&lt;br /&gt;Size: 7.8 Ounce (Pack of 4) Verified Purchase&lt;br /&gt;This tooth paste is good and works well. My teeth used to get sensitive from time to time and using Crest Pro Health toothpaste stopped that right away. The one thing you need to know about this tooth paste is that it is much much stronger (higher percentage of alcohol and peroxide)forumla compared to other tooth paste. Meaning that is you use to much you can get chemical burn in your mouth (sloughing off of the skin in you mouth) It happened to me many times when I used to much of it, eventually i found the right amount where it no longer is happened it just took a week or so of usinoff of the skin in you mouth) It happened to me many times when I used to much of it, eventually i found the right amount where it no longer is happened it just took a week or so of usin</li>
    <li> Hubby really likes this toothpaste because he has much more sensitive teeth than me.  While toothpaste is a personal thing, I am starting to come over to his side - this actually works and works better than other brands we&#x27;ve tried (I know everyone is different, but this is what works for us).  Anything to help, even a little bit, is good, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended this to us for sensitivity and it does the job but tastes a lot better than the other toothpastes we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This tooth paste lasts and leaves my breath fresh for hours. One of my favorite Crest flavors. I would recommend this for people who don&#x27;t get to brush after every meal because I feel like it keeps me fresh all day long.</li>
    <li> Has tiny plastic (?) particles in it like sand.  Horrible feeling in your mouth.  I can&#x27;t believe it is good for you.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is the worst I have ever used. It does the exact opposite of it&#x27;s true purpose and made my teeth MORE sensitive, to the point that even breathing with my mouth slightly open causes sharp pains in my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain starts right when I start brushing with the toothpaste.....as I&#x27;m brushing, I can feel it penetrating my teeth and it sends extreme shooting pains through my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thrown away the tube and switched to Sensodyne, and I&#x27;m finally feeling relief from the extreme pain. This product needs to be re-called.</li>
    <li> This seems to be working well for my sensitive teeth, as well as whitening. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> If you brush your teeth after eating or before going to bed, the enamel shield built into this toothpaste will protect your teeth for hours.  The tests on this toothpaste put it way out beyond others on the market without the coating left behind.  That said, if you are like me, you&#x27;ll find little white gummy strands showing up in your dental work once in a while.  Not to worry...but a little surprising.</li>
    <li> Great Toothpaste and Price</li>
    <li> This is so much better than their Anti-Health version of toothpaste. Their anti-health version caused cavities, made your teeth fall out and caused gum disease. The new Pro-Health version does none of these things..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest produces countless variations of essentially the same base product. They all contain either Stannous fluoride (tin fluoride) or Sodium fluoride as the only active ingredient. The Stannous fluoride is the more effective cavity reducer. They then add some color and flavoring and a magic ingredient such as baking soda, Scope or a whitener. Finally they add something that is not an active ingredient and make one or all of the claims for gingivitis, plaque, tarter, fresh breath, whitening, cavities, and/or sensitive teeth. They make enough combination to take up half of the self space of the toothpaste section but for some reason you can never find the one you liked last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive teeth formulas commonly use potassium nitrate (saltpetre [one the three ingredients in gun powder]) but I do not see it on this label.</li>
    <li> I have had a hard time finding Crest Sensitive in the Smooth Mint flavor.  It seems like most of the sensitive flavors are a very strong mint and have a tendency to irritate my mouth.  That just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me for sensitive toothpaste.  The Smooth Mint is just right though.  I was so glad to find it here.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often share my health and beauty &amp;#34;trade secrets&amp;#34; but for the price of chemical whitening, I believe that this little gem is worth the review.  YES - Crest Pro Health results in the sloughing of internal skins / membranes whatever... it got to the point where I too considered moving to another toothpaste.  Unfortunately for me I had gotten addicted to the little granuals in the paste.  FORTUNATELY, I decided that the paste was not doing enough to whiten my teeth, so I bought Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s whitening booster to add to my regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A thin layer of that on top of the paste - both problems solved!  Teeth as white as you would expect from the dentist&#x27;s procedure, AND no more skin loss.  The only reason I am not giving this product the five star rating is the issue faced when using it alone - which is annoying and gross!</li>
    <li> It is what it is. It works the way it said it will. I have no passionate feeling about it.</li>
    <li> I was using Sensodyne which was working great. But one day saw a great sale on the Sensitive Crest Toothpaste and decided to try it. After a week of using this product my teeth are super sensitive. I will be switching back to Sensodyne.</li>
    <li> Causes the inside of the mouth to peel.  This is unacceptable....threw my tube in the trash!</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase. Arrived quick.</li>
    <li> I got this for free from BzzAgent.  I love how it visibly whitens my teeth.  My teeth feel truly clean after.  I will be buying it in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. The mint flavor is mild enough to not burn my mouth or be overpowering. It&#x27;s also not thick and goofy like other sensitive brands b I find it to perform as well as any other Crest product I have used in the past. I&#x27;ve used it for several months, and my teeth are not quite as sensitive to cold as before. I&#x27;ve notice less tartar boils up also. It&#x27;s not a miracle product or brilliant whitener but it&#x27;s the only toothpaste I&#x27;ll use now.</li>
    <li> A recent trip to the dentist informed me that this toothpaste has been known to discolor teeth due to the type of fluoride that it uses.  Beware!  As other reviewers have mentioned, it always causes the skin on the inside of my cheeks to peel off.  I&#x27;ve never experienced this from another toothpaste and I can&#x27;t imagine this side-effect is contributing to the my overall health or the quality of my tooth enamel.  Why would you use this when you could use a product that has the same effect and doesn&#x27;t burn off the skin in your mouth?  Um...not sure.  Not buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth but don&#x27;t like paying the high price of Sensodyne (what my dentist recommended). But anytime I use &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste my teeth get ultra-sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;Since using this toothpaste my teeth are doing much better and it&#x27;s cheaper than Sensodyne! It cleans well and leaves breath fresh.</li>
    <li> Used the old formulation of this product for years (Crest Sensitivity Clinical) and it worked great - it was a definite 5 star product! My teeth always felt very clean &amp; I never had any issues with sensitive teeth. Recently though, they changed the formulation along with the name and it&#x27;s not for the better. It&#x27;s a gel now, no longer a paste, and tastes terrible - sour and bitter at the same time. I really shouldn&#x27;t have had to chew sugarless gum this morning to get rid of the taste of my new toothpaste. The sensitivity protection may still be there, but sheesh... the taste is spectacularly awful.</li>
    <li> I am sure that Crest has some great products but this One that is Labeled Crest Pro Health with Enamal shield is horrible  I tried it because I wanted a protective toothpast, had used Sensodyne in the past and tried this because of seemingly added benenfits.  This is not just Crest Pro Health but Pro Health with What they call Enamal Shield.  Every time I USED IT  it gave me a very gritty taste in my mouth that lasted for Hours on end.  Like having bitten off a piece of aluminum foil.  Horrible experience.  Dont know what they did to the formula.</li>
    <li> My go too tooth paste</li>
    <li> Started buying this as an alternative to Sensodyne sensitive toothpaste.  Works just as well, has the same active ingredient, and is great to have an alternative when I need toothpaste and the other isn&#x27;t on sale.  So instead of waiting around for a Sensodyne sale, I just check around for one or the other to see which has the lower price at the time.  Works out well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far as using it goes, it has worked really well.  I do have sensitive teeth and if I use regular toothpastes for too long I really start to notice it a lot.  But between Crest Sensitive and Sensodyne my teeth are very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you look into this before buying though as some have reported plastic beads inside that can get stuck in your gums (harboring bacteria) and/or getting chemical burns from over use.  My wife and I brush our teeth twice per day with this and neither of us have encountered any issues.  But just a heads up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  Went to the dentist the other day and asked about this toothpaste.  I was told that I did not have any of the beads stuck in my gums.  However, they have had a number of people who have had the beads stuck in their gums - although they say it hadn&#x27;t gotten to the point of being a problem for anyone yet but they were suspicious.</li>
    <li> Great tooth paste especially for sensitve teeth.</li>
    <li> Wonderful toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for yearsss and just learned that the blue specks in the toothpaste are not advantageous, oral chemicals or paste, but PLASTIC! I&#x27;ve flossed them from between my teeth in the past but never thought much of them. However, I just learned that some patients have gotten them stuck underneath their gum line. Since plastic harbors bacteria, this is not a good thing. I&#x27;ve quit using hand soap and liquid body soap that has plastic in them because those plastic bits clog municipal treatment plants AND end up in our nation&#x27;s watersheds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve quit using this toothpaste and have switched to Crest for Life (50+ years) since I need help with my enamel. I&#x27;m only in my 30&#x27;s but my dentist warned me about how thin my enamel is. So, I now use the &amp;quot;Life&amp;quot; type by Crest and a enamel-building mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this online but I found myself on this page because of what it was doing to my mouth. I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about a week and I&#x27;ve noticed that food has been tasting much blander and that my tongue feels dry, scratchy, and all around uncomfortable. I was worried it could be a medical condition but reading these other reviews I think I have a mild chemical burn on my tongue from this toothpaste. It would make sense, since these symptoms have only popped up and gotten worse since I switched to this toothpaste. I&#x27;m throwing it away and getting a different brand, hopefully that&#x27;ll put my tongue and taste buds back to normal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste for nearly 2-years, and my dentist tells me my teeth and gum condition fall into the top 10 percent of what he sees at bi-annual cleanings.  He also reported, \\&quot;I wish I could do as well with my cleaning as you.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste took a little time to like in the beginning because it so much stronger than what I had been using.  It also leaves a film coating that was a surprise.  However, as the mouth condition seemed to improve, the film coating seemed less.  To some extent, I also attempted to rinse more so as to reduce the film&#x27;s appearance on my lips in the morning.  Now film it is barely there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I travel I don&#x27;t take large tubes, but instead use the samples my dentist puts in his cleaning bags.  Those popular brands might work, but I surely wonder how much given how much better I&#x27;m doing now with Pro-Health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m at then end of my 5th large Pro-Health tube, and wonder what else I would have to accept if it were no longer available, but my reflection to this last thought is never encouraging.</li>
    <li> This has worked well for me, as good as Sensodyne.  I don&#x27;t care for Sensodyne&#x27;s flavor and consistency, so there you go.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is for sensitive teeth, but the grainy texture of it irritates my teeth.  Leaves your mouth feeling fresh though.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and as described.</li>
    <li> Crest is a good thooth paste. sometimes I have a chance to buy stuffs through the net so why not ordering along products that we will use in a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I only like toothepastes, which this claims to be.  But it&#x27;s one of those sparkly gels, and i can&#x27;t stand gels that stick to my teeth.</li>
    <li> Awful toothpaste. I used to love crest pro health but everytime I use this toothpaste it leaves a thin layer of film in my mouth that feels so nasty and I end up spitting it out multiple times, its not just this toothpaste its all the new crest pro health line. Will not be buying again. Sticking with colgate total and aquafresh extreme which ive had good results with both</li>
    <li> I had been using this toothpaste for the past month and noticed that each time after brushing my teeth, the skin inside my mouth would start to peel off. I thought that maybe I was brushing too hard or that the somewhat rough side of the toothbrush was causing this to happen, so I tried to be more gentle, but it just kept on happening. I used a different toothpaste while visiting my parents and immediately the peeling stopped. I just did a little internet  research and it looks like tons of people have at the same problem with this product.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste on the market for taking care of your teeth.  Forget the Whitening bologna........ I&#x27;d much rather keep all my teeth and be able to have a steak when I&#x27;m 60 or 70 as opposed to having pretty white teeth for half my life.  Besides there are plenty of whitening products out there you can purchase if your that self absorbed.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price.  Hard to find in local stores for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This is the exact brand my dentist recommends for my sensitive teeth, and I have used this for a few years now with great results.  My wife starting complaining about sensitive teeth, so she tried this and is sold on being a great sensitive toothpaste.  Purchasing these on Amazon is cheaper than in the stores in my area.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I was unable to find Crest Sensitivity on a recent shopping trip, and thought it had just been another case of rebranding; not so.  I found this product to be much harsher than the &#x27;sensitivity&#x27; variety, and where Crest sensitivity can be used without pain, this immediately caused pain during brushing.  It may be the formula specific to this type, or the mint flavorant used, but something in this product makes it very uncomfortable to use on sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> This is our go-to toothpaste. It has a good taste and it seems to help with tooth sensitivity. Good price, too.</li>
    <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think toothpaste would be something you would have to be so overly critical of, but this toothpaste takes the cake for most disgusting thing I&#x27;ve ever tasted. It has this disgusting aftertaste of rotten meat (or something - I&#x27;ve never been able to figure it out) and doesn&#x27;t give you the typical icy clean taste of peppermint that most toothpastes do. I&#x27;ve never used it unless I was in an emergency and it was all I had in my travel kit because it tastes that gross. Out of all the toothpaste options, I guess they aren&#x27;t all created equal.</li>
    <li> I am usually quite particular about my toothpaste and the Crest pro health series has always delivered on good experiences.  I typically use the whitening version or the cavity protection version, but as my teeth tend to go through sensitive moments in life I gave this a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is slightly chalky, exactly what I have come to expect from a toothpaste for sensitivity, but the flavor was more dull than normal products I use as well.  This will not be a product I use on a continuous basis, but it seemed to help with sensitivity after just a few days of use.</li>
    <li> As I get older I appreciate the sensitive toothpastes more and more, I find Crest works just as well as Sensodyne for a much better price.</li>
    <li> Get my teeth cleaned by my dentist 3-4 times annually. Advertised as fighting plaque, among other undesirables, this more expensive Crest seems to have made a difference in how long the work takes to complete &amp; how healthy my mouth seems to be to my dentist. Clearly I&#x27;m pleased with these outcomes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m delighted with this item and the bargain price! I need this particular brand of toothpaste because I have gum issues and very sensitive teeth. To get four tubes of this size for this price is just remarkable. I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I got some from my dentist to use so had to buy more used most of little tube up works so well on my sore mouth I HAD SOME ISUSES with my teeth after filling that just didn&#x27;t seem to go away with orjel or anything until I brushed with this and it work so well good price and  will probably order again when needed.</li>
    <li> I used this toothpaste just once today, and I will be throwing away the tube.  The taste is horrendous, and after brushing your gums stick to your teeth for awhile.  I&#x27;ve used Crest Sensitivity for years, and like others, all of a sudden it&#x27;s no longer available for sale.  I thought this was the same thing, just a different package.  Totally wrong, not even the same active ingredient.  I guess I will have to go back to Sensodyne.  The reason I left them was I had trouble with their new toothpaste tube cap (arthritic hands).  Crest, why would you discontinue a perfectly good product and lose a loyal customer?</li>
    <li> This one i already used before and order again;))) so gooooood!</li>
    <li> Had the same issue with skin sloughing. It started under my tongue and a week later had moved to the inside of my lips, gums, and cheeks.  It ended up being painful every time I moved my tongue. I just thought I had to get used to the toothpaste, but after reading reviews on here I will definitely be switching back to Pronamel!</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste! Perfectly cleans, freshens the mouth, pleasant to the taste! My family is happy!</li>
    <li> Every time I went to the dentist I had a cavity.  I was using another brand of sensitive toothpaste and my dentist questioned me about what I was using since I brush and floss regularly.  He suggested that  I switch to this product.  That was years ago and I haven&#x27;t had a problem since.  This brand works great for those of us with sensitive teeth also.</li>
    <li> worst toothpaste I have ever used. I was using Sensodyne for a while and decided to try something cheaper. This is terrible stuff. It&#x27;s overly minty and rough. I used this for a week and every single time I used it I felt gummy sticky skinlike substance in my mouth that I had to spit out. I don&#x27;t know what it was but it was definitely because of this toothpaste. I&#x27;m going back to Sensodyne. I don&#x27;t even know how a toothpaste this terrible is allowed to be made.</li>
    <li> Microbeads - so disappointed.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is absolutely terrible! It causes my cheek to slough which is disgusting. Now I&#x27;m stuck with 4 tubes of the darned thing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not horrible but I don&#x27;t like the gritty feeling of the paste.  Sensodyne or the store brand version is so much better, in comparison.  I dislike the little specks in the pro-health toothpaste.  If I&#x27;m cleaning my teeth, why do I want these little things in my mouth?</li>
    <li> Saved my teeth!  Sensitivity and pain - nothing better!</li>
    <li> Good deal. Satisfied.</li>
