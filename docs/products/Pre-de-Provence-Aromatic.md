### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Of you&#x27;re a fan of Pre de Prvence, then this bath gel is perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s actually incredibly moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>One of my kids thinks it smells great.  </li>
      <li>Smells great.</li>
      <li>This is great.</li>
      <li>This men&#x27;s bath gel has a very pleasant scent and creates a nice lather in the shower.</li>
      <li>Beautiful design for this body wash that makes it look elegant stored for use.  </li>
      <li>Has a woodsy, spicy scent that is very prominent while using, but disapates within an hour.  </li>
      <li>This is a very nice shower gel and has a very masculine but wonderful scent.</li>
      <li>It was no surprise that the shampoo was great and the soap worked fine</li>
      <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
      <li>It has nice ingredients including shea oil and aloe vera</li>
      <li>This product is nice as a body wash, but I don&#x27;t like it as a shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This might not be the scent I would pick on my own.</li>
      <li>On the bright side it does have a nice outdoorsy scent, but not one that is noticeably better than any variety of body washes you can get for under 10 bucks.  </li>
      <li>Mrs. Boilermate liked the fragrance as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Daddy likes nice things--especially grooming products.  </li>
      <li>This review is for the Pre de Provence Aromatic, Warm and Spicy, No. 63</li>
      <li>My wife liked it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This would make a nice gift for a man who is content to use bodywash.</li>
      <li>It smells nice in the shower, and then goes</li>
      <li>This has a pleasant smell, though it is a bit strong for my senses.  </li>
      <li>This scent is a very strong cologne type smell.</li>
      <li>Very strong smell that permeates the air.</li>
      <li>but the scent is very rich and luxurious smelling and it feels really nice on your skin.</li>
      <li>Hydration qualities are not that great comparing to Dove, Neutropenia, or Gillette body washes, and $18 for 8 ounces seems pretty pricey .</li>
      <li>Most of us will use more by accident or intent (</li>
      <li>should also mention the 63 shave soap and cream which are excellent products as well, and also proportionately better deals, as both last longer for the price.</li>
      <li>It has a manly fragrance, most notably that of leather and tobacco.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product for its mid-price point and for its zingy rosemary/peppercorn fragrance.  </li>
      <li>That is what I love about this</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brew for my hair and body for weeks now, and I love it.</li>
      <li>I prefer the more feminine scent of lavender for example or even the more gender neutral rosemary.</li>
      <li>Because of this, I tend to use more that I would normally.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The spiced scent is terrifically refreshing, and the gel leaves no layer of film on my skin.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Most of us will use more by accident or intent (</li>
      <li>should also mention the 63 shave soap and cream which are excellent products as well, and also proportionately better deals, as both last longer for the price.</li>
      <li>Ok, look: I&#x27;m picky.  </li>
      <li>this &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; shampoo/body wash work any better than &amp;#34;ordinary&amp;#34</li>
      <li>It has an exotic, yet manly, aroma</li>
      <li>Strikes me as something I&#x27;ll use more in the winter, if that makes any sense at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff is so good, I flew through my first bottle in a couple weeks, and immediately had to order another.  </li>
      <li>Its fragrance is true to the description of being warm and spicy -- a  welcoming aroma.  </li>
      <li>The scent seems fairly strong while applying the product but, thankfully, the scent mostly rinses away.  </li>
      <li>Strong manly scented body/hair wash lathers nicely and rinses clean.  </li>
      <li>I liked the smell a lot, but I feel American Crew smells as good or better, felt like it got my hair cleaner, and did so more efficiently.</li>
      <li>a shampoo, 63 was somewhat less impressive, as it seemed to need more product to cover my scalp than dedicated shampoos would.</li>
      <li>No. 63 does rinse out of hair (and off skin) easily.</li>
      <li>It rinses easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any filmy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does have a strong scent that lasts throughout the day, but that&#x27;s one of its selling points, in my book.</li>
      <li>This Pr&amp;eacute; de Provence No. 63 for Men body wash, when opened, had a strong smell.</li>
      <li>Until that hour or so has passed, it&#x27;s just too strong for me to be close to it.</li>
      <li>However, to be honest, I have to remove one star for the watery consistently and another because of the price.</li>
      <li>But the scent did not bother me and the product otherwise works fine.</li>
      <li>Strong, masculine scent - just like the description says, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; in a good way.</li>
      <li>Users will not find that it produces copious suds...or even a light foam.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance remains lightly on my skin/hair for an hour or two</li>
      <li>If the scent smelled the same straight out of the bottle as it does about an hour after putting it on, it&#x27;d be perfect.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised with the nice lather on my hair, and I felt very clean afterward.</li>
      <li>The shea butter and glycerin did a fine job of moisturizing my skin, so I felt clean without any drying side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I find the fragrance is strong enough that it still lingers in the air for a while after use, and is a pleasant experience.  </li>
      <li>but my hair is clean and my skin feels</li>
      <li>One product that makes your hair feel clean and also use it as a body wash.</li>
      <li>Though the product description reads like a liqueur or wine, it is, indeed, deserving of such elaborate description.</li>
      <li>I would describe the scent as &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;masculine.&amp;#34; My hair and body feel clean after each use.</li>
      <li>Use it for those special occasions.</li>
      <li>Combined with the relatively high price, I found this product wasn&#x27;t for me, though I&#x27;m sure others would enjoy it.</li>
      <li>That is good enough for me!</li>
      <li>Even after I washed the outside of the bottle off in the faucet, we could still smell the scent from the parts that got on the label, even after a good rinsing.  </li>
      <li>Fairly mild cleanser, but does of keeping you clean.</li>
      <li>you are also sensitive to strong smells (like I am), you can use this, just don&#x27;t use more than needed.</li>
      <li>I’m not sure why it’s called a “masculine fragrance”, but it’s warm, pleasant, and not musky like many &#x27;manly&#x27; grooming products.</li>
      <li>RECOMMENDED if you want a quality shampoo / body wash that will leave you feeling fresh, clean and manly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am not quite sure why 63 costs so much; the smell is great, so I presume the fragrance is the main price factor, but the allure of a luxury French product probably also adds some inflation.</li>

      <li>This product does smell OK, but the overwhelming power of it turned me against it entirely.</li>
      <li>Ultimately, I think this is a good body wash, but unless you are ultra frugal with it, you will not get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>performance is fine, and the scent lasts much of the day, but is not overpowering.</li>
      <li>The smell is just as good, and the technical performance as shaving products is very high quality.</li>
      <li>The smell is just as good, and the technical performance as shaving products is very high quality.efficiently measured one teaspoonful each day of product, you would get about 48 days of use out of this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is free of parabens, sulfates and phtalates - so it won&#x27;t later up a lot but will be much better for your skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So when this popped up in Vine, I figured it was worth a shot.  </li>
      <li>Not bad in any way, but something to be aware of.</li>
      <li>I think I can say with confidence if you use this gel the scent will not wear off right away.</li>
      <li>The dollar conscious may want to get some luxury bar soap instead, which can do just as good a job at cleaning without drying out if you get the right brand, and which last a lot longer.</li>

      <li>In any case, I like the smell, but if you want something mild and / or very floral, you will not like this too much.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bottle is also attractive enough that you&#x27;ll display it openly in your bathroom.</li>
      <li>It does a fine job on the body, but as far as the hair?  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a distinctive, but masculine scent which would be a fine cleansing option.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m used to a light scent that rinses almost completely</li>
      <li>At first blush, it was a &amp;#34;oh, no.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>This manages to smell more like a traditional man scent than those without giving me the migraine that those do.  </li>
      <li>I was a bit skeptical at first, but the Pre de provence shower gel is a delightful smelling experience.</li>
      <li>If you have a specific affinity for this scent, however, you might like this product more than I did.</li>
      <li>Some &amp;#34;men&#x27;s care products&amp;#34; that I&#x27;ve used have a post-rinse fragrance that is so powerful it announces to the whole world, &amp;#34;HE&#x27;S JUST AROUND THE CORNER!&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Just a couple of notes worth mentioning: your bathroom will take on its smell (must get on the shower curtain and walls) and it doesn&#x27;t lather up quite as much as shampoo or a bar of soap.</li>
      <li>It is a pretty vigorous scent, and wakes one up in the morning.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product works very well for a 2-in-1. I was surprised with the nice lather on my hair, and I felt very clean afterward. The downside was that I was also very strongly marked with scent. This scent is a very strong cologne type smell. Not bad in any way, but something to be aware of. The scent faded away after a few hours so that anyone not in my personal space wouldn&#x27;t have noticed, but the bathroom smelled like an Abercrombie outlet after using the product. Combined with the relatively high price, I found this product wasn&#x27;t for me, though I&#x27;m sure others would enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful design for this body wash that makes it look elegant stored for use.  Its fragrance is true to the description of being warm and spicy -- a  welcoming aroma.  The man of the house gives it a thumbs up for the scent &amp; quality of the lather.  I find the fragrance is strong enough that it still lingers in the air for a while after use, and is a pleasant experience.  I would seek out soaps and other body washes from Pre de Provence to try.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice shower gel and has a very masculine but wonderful scent. It has nice ingredients including shea oil and aloe vera and you can use it both as a body wash and shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is free of parabens, sulfates and phtalates - so it won&#x27;t later up a lot but will be much better for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but the scent is very rich and luxurious smelling and it feels really nice on your skin. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very American and confess that French soaps and shampoos are not my thing. I&#x27;ve never been in a salon (and never will). It was no surprise that the shampoo was great and the soap worked fine (how do you really know?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here was the surprise: this is a manly smell that you might expect to find in sample sizes at a luxury hotel (and assume they cost a fortune). I&#x27;m intrigued enough that I&#x27;ve added their other &amp;#34;63&amp;#34; products (shaving soap &amp; aftershave) to my wishlist. Strikes me as something I&#x27;ll use more in the winter, if that makes any sense at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance is fine, and the scent lasts much of the day, but is not overpowering. My wife liked it. I have nothing negative to say about it.</li>
    <li> My husband has a bit of a problem in that he has no sense of smell but wants shampoos and soaps that don&#x27;t smell girly.  So when this popped up in Vine, I figured it was worth a shot.  I opened it to smell it and... mixed feelings.  It&#x27;s definitely way batter than any of those drug store products that are touted as being so manly the women will crawling all over you.  Those stink.  This manages to smell more like a traditional man scent than those without giving me the migraine that those do.  BUT, the scent is rather strong and takes a little longer than some to dissipate.  That aspect I am not very fond of.  If the scent smelled the same straight out of the bottle as it does about an hour after putting it on, it&#x27;d be perfect.  Until that hour or so has passed, it&#x27;s just too strong for me to be close to it.</li>
    <li> I use Neutrogena&#x27;s &amp;#34;Rainbath&amp;#34; as my everyday shower gel.  So I&#x27;m used to a light scent that rinses almost completely away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Warm and Spicy N. 63&amp;#34; is *not* a light scent that rinses away. This is a big, bold scent.  I think this is what would happen if you mixed original formula Old Spice with Pinaud Clubman: manly scent, bold, as subtle as a brick on a 2 x 4.  That said, it&#x27;s not *nearly* as olfactorily  assaulting as say, AXE.  So while it may not rinse completely off, at least it&#x27;s not stinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as cleaning goes, I found it great on my skin, but a bit harsh on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll wear it on weekend, but my day-to-day shower gel remains as is.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product for its mid-price point and for its zingy rosemary/peppercorn fragrance.  This helps to ease me into my morning and leaves me with a balanced masculine scent residue that lasts until I apply aftershave moisturizing cream and matching deodorant.  This liquid soap product works on both hair and skin so it simplifies the toiletry rack in my shower.  Users will not find that it produces copious suds...or even a light foam.  What is does provide is gentle, fragrant cleansing.  That is good enough for me!</li>
    <li> Strong, masculine scent - just like the description says, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; in a good way. It smells natural and &#x27;real,&#x27; unlike the chemically-tinged scent of a lot of cheaper body washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer a thicker, sudsier lather, and this doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;froth&amp;#34; quite as much...but that&#x27;s okay. It rinses easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any filmy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend, however, thought it was too strong...and the scent does seem to linger. I&#x27;m going to try and fool her and keep using it for a period of time without telling her and we&#x27;ll see if she really notices, or if it&#x27;s just her dislike of change. I normally use Dove products, which I like, and the scent doesn&#x27;t linger nearly as much (it&#x27;s also a cheaper product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it though...it&#x27;s a distinctive, but masculine scent which would be a fine cleansing option.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, the purpose of a shower is to remove odors, not exchange one odor for another. As such,  I normally don&#x27;t like personal care products with any kind of a lingering fragrance, but the description of the fragrance for this hair and body wash was intriguing, which is why I selected it from my Vine list. I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though this product is described as a body wash and shampoo I only used it as a body wash. It dispenses from the bottle as a clear thick liquid, but not as thick as a gel. If you&#x27;re used to lots of lather from your body wash or shower gel you might be disappointed, as it doesn&#x27;t really lather. Despite the lack of a noticeable lather, however, it does clean well and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I&#x27;m not good at describing fragrances, I can say that this product has a nice masculine fragrance that is not overpowering. Some &amp;#34;men&#x27;s care products&amp;#34; that I&#x27;ve used have a post-rinse fragrance that is so powerful it announces to the whole world, &amp;#34;HE&#x27;S JUST AROUND THE CORNER!&amp;#34; This is not one of those products. What remains after you&#x27;ve rinsed this off is pleasantly subtle. Mrs. Boilermate liked the fragrance as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;br /&gt;Does this &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; shampoo/body wash work any better than &amp;#34;ordinary&amp;#34; products? Not really, but it has a sophisticated masculine fragrance that both Mrs. Boilermate and I like. I have tried other &amp;#34;men&#x27;s care products&amp;#34; and promptly discarded them after one use due to their lingering fragrance/odor after they were rinsed off. This one is different. I expect to use this occasionally for some &amp;#34;personal pampering&amp;#34; until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> At first blush, it was a &amp;#34;oh, no.&amp;#34;  This Pr&amp;eacute; de Provence No. 63 for Men body wash, when opened, had a strong smell. I was showering prior to a visit to the dentist, and I envisioned the hygienist&#x27;s eyes watering as she labored over me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even though this scented body wash came out &amp;#34;strong,&amp;#34; after rinsing, the fragrance was more subtle.  Granted, olfactory fatigue is real, but I think this reduction in the intensity of the odor was real (and neither the hygienist not the dentist seemed to mind).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body lotion produces light suds, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, rinses out nicely, and a little bit goes a long way.  The manufacturers claim that it&#x27;s not tested on animals.  The fragrance itself?  You&#x27;ll love it or hate it, as with most fragrances. Use it for those special occasions.</li>
    <li> This product is nice as a body wash, but I don&#x27;t like it as a shampoo.  Though it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin, it did seem too harsh for my hair, leaving it more dry/straw-like than my usual shampoos (Head &amp; Shoulders, Fructis).  The scent seems fairly strong while applying the product but, thankfully, the scent mostly rinses away.  Because this body wash is more expensive than some others I have used that work just as well as a body wash, I doubt I would buy this product.  If you have a specific affinity for this scent, however, you might like this product more than I did.</li>
    <li> No. 63 Men’s Hair &amp; Body Wash&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer: Pr&amp;eacute; de Provence&lt;br /&gt;Contents: 8 fl. oz.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon price: $15.58&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Pr&amp;eacute; de Provence’s No. 63 fragrance. I’m not sure why it’s called a “masculine fragrance”, but it’s warm, pleasant, and not musky like many &#x27;manly&#x27; grooming products. Its fragrance is quite pronounced and scents the whole bathroom when I shower. The fragrance remains lightly on my skin/hair for an hour or two afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected a thicker consistency and am a disappointed that it’s thin and watery. It flows right through my fingers unless I dispense it carefully into my palm. Because of this, I tend to use more that I would normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are very satisfactory. When I wash up and shampoo there isn’t excessive lather but my hair is clean and my skin feels smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a quality product from a French firm that makes a high-end line of grooming products. However, to be honest, I have to remove one star for the watery consistently and another because of the price. At nearly $16.00 for 8 ounces, this product costs about $2.00 per ounce.</li>
    <li> This has a pleasant smell, though it is a bit strong for my senses.  One of my kids thinks it smells great.  It is hard to write a review on scents because they are so individual.  One thing I can say with certainty is that this scent is long lasting. The bottle cap accidentally came off in the mail, some of the gel oozed out and the scent wafted through the package and onto all out other mail.  Even after I washed the outside of the bottle off in the faucet, we could still smell the scent from the parts that got on the label, even after a good rinsing.  I think I can say with confidence if you use this gel the scent will not wear off right away.</li>
    <li> This men&#x27;s bath gel has a very pleasant scent and creates a nice lather in the shower. The spicy, woodsy type scent should appeal for me, and women will probably like it as well.. But it&#x27;s a bit pricey versus other bath gels out there. Of you&#x27;re a fan of Pre de Prvence, then this bath gel is perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
    <li> Overall I was very unimpressed with this product.  It didn’t have a very cleansing affect on both hair and body.  It came in a small 10 ounce bottle that didn’t have a squeeze cap so that one could control the amount of body was you want.  Instead it just dumped out everywhere in the shower.  Not worth the money or time to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Jack Black shampoo for a while now, and quite frankly, this costs the same and doesn&#x27;t come even close to how brilliant Jack Black is.</li>
    <li> With a fancy French name and such a flowery description, I expected this body wash to be a revelation.  Especially for 16 bucks for an eight ounce bottle.  Sadly, the wash is a bit thin and doesn&#x27;t lather up at all.  It does a fine job on the body, but as far as the hair?  Not so much.  On the bright side it does have a nice outdoorsy scent, but not one that is noticeably better than any variety of body washes you can get for under 10 bucks.  In short, this is a fine body wash, but there is no reason to spend the extra money to get it.</li>
    <li> This does the job as far as a shampoo and body wash. If you want a double duty cleaning product, especially for the gym, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I have been carrying it back and forth to the rec center. He tried it first and said to me, &amp;#34;I thought you said all the other reviewers were raving about the odor?&amp;#34; I admitted that I had read that. He told me that it was entirely too strong in odor for him so I should try it and see if it suited me more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind scented things. This might not be the scent I would pick on my own. I prefer the more feminine scent of lavender for example or even the more gender neutral rosemary. But the scent did not bother me and the product otherwise works fine. But be warned that one out of the two of us would definitely not use it again because of its smell.</li>
    <li> This is a woodsy / somewhat sweet scent, with a heavy tobacco flower and violet scent. It is a pretty vigorous scent, and wakes one up in the morning. Like every body wash I have ever used, the odor is gone 5 minutes after I leave the shower, so I would not rely on this to last for the day or even for several hours. It smells nice in the shower, and then goes bye-bye. The comments about smelling this for the rest of the day (whether that is good or bad depends on the reviewer) strike me as being pretty inexplicable, as my wife has a very keen nose and did not smell this on me after my shower at all. Is this residual psychological or are these other reviewers possessed of bloodhound level olfactory sensors? In any case, I like the smell, but if you want something mild and / or very floral, you will not like this too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a body wash, 63 is a decent performer. A center of palm full on a loofah will do the trick; they say most body wash users use about 2 to 3 times more product than they should, which is why the manufacturers would rather you buy washes over bar soap, which is both cheaper and harder to squander. Try to use only a teaspoonful or less of 63, and I think it will be enough. The wash did not irritate any area of my body, even when left on for a few minutes. and it did not leave any film or tackiness on the skin once rinsed. The shea butter and glycerin did a fine job of moisturizing my skin, so I felt clean without any drying side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a shampoo, 63 was somewhat less impressive, as it seemed to need more product to cover my scalp than dedicated shampoos would. I liked the smell a lot, but I feel American Crew smells as good or better, felt like it got my hair cleaner, and did so more efficiently. Plus if you use this as a shampoo and body wash both, you will blow through this teeny 8 oz bottle in a flash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to my only complaint about 63: the cost per ounce. If you used this as a body wash only, and efficiently measured one teaspoonful each day of product, you would get about 48 days of use out of this. Most of us will use more by accident or intent (some days the loofah does not lather up too well!) and if you use this without a loofah, and / or use it as a shampoo, you could easily blow through this small bottle in a couple of weeks. If $2 an ounce for 2-3 weeks of use sounds distressing, you can either get something cheaper or carefully ration out the dose, use a loofah, and get a separate shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not quite sure why 63 costs so much; the smell is great, so I presume the fragrance is the main price factor, but the allure of a luxury French product probably also adds some inflation. Ultimately, I think this is a good body wash, but unless you are ultra frugal with it, you will not get your money&#x27;s worth. The dollar conscious may want to get some luxury bar soap instead, which can do just as good a job at cleaning without drying out if you get the right brand, and which last a lot longer. If the bang for the buck ratio does not trouble you though, 63 body wash is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also mention the 63 shave soap and cream which are excellent products as well, and also proportionately better deals, as both last longer for the price. The smell is just as good, and the technical performance as shaving products is very high quality.efficiently measured one teaspoonful each day of product, you would get about 48 days of use out of this.

    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like I should be discussing fabric swatches and window treatments but it is a little too feminine for me. The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to persist but it still tends to conflict with cologne fragrances I chose to wear. I also think I have to use more than I am accustomed to with less pricey products that meet the same need.</li>
    <li> This kind of luxury is usually discovered in a fancy hotel or spa, but I discovered it on Amazon. Amazing stuff. Though the product description reads like a liqueur or wine, it is, indeed, deserving of such elaborate description. My nose is not as keen as some others, but this masculine essence is unmistakable. The aroma brings me back to the days of walking past the tobacco shop at the mall--not smoke, but sweet and alluring pipe tobacco. If Axe is a chick magnet for teens and millennials, then this is for the grown-ups among us, whether eligible or just wanting to remind your significant other that you still live in the same house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brew for my hair and body for weeks now, and I love it. Just a couple of notes worth mentioning: your bathroom will take on its smell (must get on the shower curtain and walls) and it doesn&#x27;t lather up quite as much as shampoo or a bar of soap. Still, this bottle is lasting me surprisingly long, perhaps because it is a thin consistency that goes a long way, even without a loofa, which would make it last even longer. But a real man doesn&#x27;t use a loofa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indulge yourself.</li>
    <li> A little pricey than your ordinary body wash, but you certainly do get what you pay for:  Smells great and you probably won&#x27;t need additional cologne after.  It is advertised as &amp;#34;Free of Parabens, Sulfates and Phthalates.&amp;#34;  I can pretend and tell you that I know what those are, but I&#x27;d be straight out lying.  After some research, I learned that those are some chemicals that are sometimes added to your body products(ingredients used in plastic and other various drugs,) which I can agree are not good, but if I made it this far in life, then I guess its not as bad as it sounds.  If I had to describe the scent, it would be very close to citrus, but not all noses are created equal.  Bottle is also attractive enough that you&#x27;ll display it openly in your bathroom.</li>
    <li> Very strong smell that permeates the air. It also doesn&#x27;t lather very well. This product does smell OK, but the overwhelming power of it turned me against it entirely. I asked my partner to shower again to get the smell off.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Lasts for a while too.</li>
    <li> Ok, look: I&#x27;m picky.  Daddy likes nice things--especially grooming products.  This stuff is so good, I flew through my first bottle in a couple weeks, and immediately had to order another.  Not only is it one of the best-smelling men&#x27;s bodywashes out there, it&#x27;s actually incredibly moisturizing.  It does have a strong scent that lasts throughout the day, but that&#x27;s one of its selling points, in my book.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Pre de Provence Aromatic, Warm and Spicy, No. 63 Men&#x27;s (Hair and Body Wash) Shower Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This two-in-one hair and body wash lathers well and has a nice scent that lingers on ever so slightly and only for a short while after showering.  I would describe the scent as &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;masculine.&amp;#34; My hair and body feel clean after each use.</li>
    <li> This is a great-smelly body wash.  It has an exotic, yet manly, aroma, that&#x27;s strong enough to linger a while, without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned when I first smelled this stuff because it does smell a little like Old Spice, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but the smell was so strong I was worried that I was going to spend the day being that guy who smells like he showered in cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, the smell mostly washes off and the remaining scent is very subtle.</li>
    <li> I typically use a soap and washcloth for bathing, and dedicated shampoo to eash my hair, but I wanted to try the Pre de Provence to see what it is like. In short, it works, but it is probably not something I would buy for myself as a replacement to my traditional toiletries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spiced scent is terrifically refreshing, and the gel leaves no layer of film on my skin. That is what I love about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This colorless gel is on the thin side, yet it does lather rather decently. It takes a generous portion to wash my short hair, and the scent is still detectable in my hair for awhile after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would make a nice gift for a man who is content to use bodywash. I will go back to my bar soad after the bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> I have not worn after shave or cologne for some time. At first I thought the fragrance was too strong but now after a few days of showering with it I do like the fragrance and no complaints from my wife</li>
    <li> I generally grab Bath and Body works for men as my go to shower gel. I decided to try something new and picked this up and checked it out. It has a decent odor. Fairly mild cleanser, but does of keeping you clean. And isn&#x27;t that the point?</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but the Pre de provence shower gel is a delightful smelling experience. Not too much to go on about here, so I&#x27;ll keep this to the point: A strong, cedar and peppery aromatic smell is the defining characteristic of this wash. It lathers well. I don&#x27;t use it on my hair (I&#x27;m an innate skeptic when it comes to hair / body washes, but this one does the job quite fine (although not a perfect wash). Overall, the great smell makes it a worthy purchase over most other shower gels and definitely one you can save for those nights when you know you need that extra fragrance.</li>
    <li> I like the scent, but feel it is a bit on the &amp;#34;country club/old-fashioned&amp;#34; side... Hydration qualities are not that great comparing to Dove, Neutropenia, or Gillette body washes, and $18 for 8 ounces seems pretty pricey .</li>
    <li> This is great. One product that makes your hair feel clean and also use it as a body wash. No. 63 does rinse out of hair (and off skin) easily. It has a manly fragrance, most notably that of leather and tobacco. Both my son and I like this, and my wife likes the way we smell after using it. I just ordered more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are also sensitive to strong smells (like I am), you can use this, just don&#x27;t use more than needed. A little does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you want a quality shampoo / body wash that will leave you feeling fresh, clean and manly.</li>
    <li> Strong manly scented body/hair wash lathers nicely and rinses clean.  Has a woodsy, spicy scent that is very prominent while using, but disapates within an hour.  Infused with Shea oil and Aloe Vera.  Pricey for a body wash and only 8oz!</li>
