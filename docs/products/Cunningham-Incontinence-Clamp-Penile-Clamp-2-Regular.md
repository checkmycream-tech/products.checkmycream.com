      <li>But they are marvelous.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found any perfect clamp yet, but I will never wear a Cunningham again.</li>
      <li>Have been using clamp for three days with very effective leakage control.  </li>
      <li>Good Morning, HighTideHealth, and received the Cunningham Incontinence Clamp Penile,</li>
      <li>Would not be good to wear all day.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been successful in adjusting the clamp so that it feels comfortable.</li>
      <li>Made buying very easy.  </li>
      <li>Coughing or sneezing can cause some urine to leak through, but for the most part this is a very effective device ... easy to clean with mild hand soap and warm water.  </li>
      <li>I have been wearing this clamp (2 inch version) for a month 24/7 and am extremely pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>I do know it makes every day a lot better even though I regret ever doing a PSA.</li>
      <li>This sure beats wearing an indwelling catheter and urine collection leg bag ... or going through 4-5 depends a day.</li>
      <li>Buy more than one</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have time to write more.</li>
      <li>Since using this clamp I can stretch a Depends for more than 24 hours if so desired.  </li>
      <li>so far so good!</li>
      <li>The wires for making the tightness seems a bit flimsy but it works fine and snaps into place easily!  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>easy to do by hand).</li>
      <li>requires some care in putting it on in correct spot and is usually comfortable.  </li>
      <li>It is adequate.</li>
      <li>, this is a product that is comfortable and really works.  </li>
      <li>grand father of 88 used it so he wouldn&#x27;t wet himself, easy to clean,</li>
      <li>no pain, sometime had to be careful to position under clothes otherwise good product</li>
      <li>I now reserve use of the clamp to occasions when I need to take long walks (my primary form of exercise), and make sure to remove it promptly when I am done.</li>
      <li>It should have been a red flag for me that half of the reviews were from women (happy spouses, I guess!).  </li>
      <li>When I first tried it it reminded me of</li>
      <li>I used it when getting in to the hot tub or swimming pool.</li>
      <li>I still use it, only because it&#x27;s better than nothing</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the clamp ever since my prostate operation ,  As amazon started to carry other brands and let&#x27;s be honest the Cunningham clamp can hurt after awhile,  I&#x27;ve tried them all and still use the Cunningham clamp.</li>
      <li>far so good, Not a drop came out, Very easy to put on, I wear jeans alot and a bit hard to get use too, worried it may far</li>
      <li>Overall - limited but effective!</li>
      <li>It does, to a certain extent, stop urine flow.</li>
      <li>I should have ordered the large size.</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot</li>
      <li>It is a real lifesaver.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good Morning, HighTideHealth, and received the Cunningham Incontinence Clamp Penile, but I say that the images that place suggest that it is 2 clamps and not one, in the text you do not clarify that it is only 1, as indicated suggestion that packaging has only 1 clip.</li>
    <li> Ilove it the the confidencial way they maneged it. You it&#x60;s a embarassing situation. But they are marvelous. Thanks a lot</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of adjustments but once urine enters the urethra it burns like crazy and has to be removed. I have bought every clamp out there with the same results.</li>
    <li> This clamp does work.  I&#x27;ve used them for over two years.  With a little bending, it can be worn all day.  This clamp gives you confidence, when you out for a few hours.  Sometimes, it can dig into the leg - a little tug can usually correct it.  I have tried, but have found nothing can beat the Cunningham Incontinence Clamp.</li>
    <li> The warnings regarding the use of this product were vague and not emphatic. As a result, within a week or so after using the clamp I developed a urinary tract infection. When I brought this to the attention of a urologist he gave me an instruction sheet which warned about this very occurrence, and also about the risks of clamping too tightly. I now reserve use of the clamp to occasions when I need to take long walks (my primary form of exercise), and make sure to remove it promptly when I am done.</li>
    <li> It is just not a good long term solution.  Would not be good to wear all day.  It is adequate.</li>
    <li> no drip but still circulation grand father of 88 used it so he wouldn&#x27;t wet himself, easy to clean, no pain, sometime had to be careful to position under clothes otherwise good product</li>
    <li> This device was torture for me to wear. Within a few minutes I felt numbness then just sheer pain. I used it when getting in to the hot tub or swimming pool. I encourage other male incontinence users to shop around. I haven&#x27;t found any perfect clamp yet, but I will never wear a Cunningham again. It decreases urine, but it also impeded my circulation.</li>
    <li> While I use this product, I am disappointed in it. I&#x27;ve tried several different adjustments on this device. None has given me&lt;br /&gt;satisfaction. I have found the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I have to release the clamp frequently. This is in order to drain the accumulation of urine in the urethra. If I wait too long,&lt;br /&gt;  the clamp will allow leakage and/or become painful.&lt;br /&gt;2. I haven&#x27;t been successful in adjusting the clamp so that it feels comfortable. I have contacted the manufacturer and tried&lt;br /&gt;  their advice. It hasn&#x27;t helped. I still use it, only because it&#x27;s better than nothing</li>
    <li> This clamp allows me the freedom to go an hour or two without an accident. It is a real lifesaver.  Thanks. Robert Striegl</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.  highly recomend these guys.on time and to the point.  Made buying very easy.  Highly Highly Recopmend.  BOUGHT OVER AND OVER AGAIN</li>
    <li> requires some care in putting it on in correct spot and is usually comfortable.  I keep several and change every day and wash well and then soak for a day so body fluids do not stay in foam.  Takes a day to dry out, but in an emergency can squeeze water out of foam thoroughly and be used immediately with little dampness.  I do know it makes every day a lot better even though I regret ever doing a PSA.</li>
    <li> It works but painfully uncomfortable</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this clamp (2 inch version) for a month 24/7 and am extremely pleased with it.  I have an ineffective urinary sphincter muscle that was causing me to go through 4-5 Depends a day.  Since using this clamp I can stretch a Depends for more than 24 hours if so desired.  I had to slightly bend the top bar to make it fit properly (easy to do by hand). I apply hydrocortisone cream to \\&quot;my unit\\&quot; once a day after showering to keep the clamp from chaffing.  Coughing or sneezing can cause some urine to leak through, but for the most part this is a very effective device ... easy to clean with mild hand soap and warm water.  Buy more than one so you always have a clean dry one ready for use.  This sure beats wearing an indwelling catheter and urine collection leg bag ... or going through 4-5 depends a day.</li>
    <li> The design is poor. the clip pokes my pubic area. The leakage continues and when the clamp is tightened an extra notch, the gland turns blue.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this device I read the reviews on Amazon beforehand.  It should have been a red flag for me that half of the reviews were from women (happy spouses, I guess!).  But obviously they have never had to wear one of these things.  They are not comfortable to wear, but when going out for dinner or a movie, etc., they get the job done.  I tried to use it overnight while sleeping and that didn&#x27;t work out so well.  I had the mechanism set on the lowest possible tension, but still it severely restricted the blood supply to the end of the penis and that caused pain.  Back to the pad for sleeping!  Overall - limited but effective!</li>
    <li> I found this clamp to be uncomfortable and irritating. It stops the urine and I didn&#x27;t leak, but the bulk of the device and discomfort  detracts from the effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Have been using clamp for three days with very effective leakage control.  The clamp is uncomfortable when sitting due to the wire clamping mechanism.  Plan on trying other brands and also plan to try some homemade adjustments to it .  When I first tried it it reminded me of a mid-evil torture devise  due to the wire snap mechanism.  I truly hope It gives me the expected results.  so far so good!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Good for my golf game. Barely notice it. Used to use (a lot of uses) three to four depends guards during a round . Now less than one.</li>
    <li> Day 1 -So far so good, Not a drop came out, Very easy to put on, I wear jeans alot and a bit hard to get use too, worried it may far apart.&lt;br /&gt;Days 2-3,couple of drops leaked when I coughed, nothing major - There are 4 settings of tightness on this clamp but I&#x27;ve only use the 1st setting and before using this clamp I had major problems with leakage!! Getting easier to move around with it on (Starting to get use to it).  The wires for making the tightness seems a bit flimsy but it works fine and snaps into place easily!  Hope this reviews helps others - DN</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the clamp ever since my prostate operation ,  As amazon started to carry other brands and let&#x27;s be honest the Cunningham clamp can hurt after awhile,  I&#x27;ve tried them all and still use the Cunningham clamp.</li>
    <li> Did not work. I don&#x27;t have time to write more.</li>
    <li> I purchased three of these devices and ordered the medium size. I should have ordered the large size. With either size&lt;br /&gt;wearing these things is like having your penis in a vice. If you are a somewhat active person, as I am, body movement&lt;br /&gt;causes irritation to a degree that&#x27;s unbearable.  It does, to a certain extent, stop urine flow. Each night and morning I&lt;br /&gt;have to use a pain reliever lotion to stop the burning and itching.</li>
    <li> I recently became incontinent after prostate surgery.  I now leak a lot.  Hopefully this problem will go away but in the&lt;br /&gt;meantime, this is a product that is comfortable and really works.  It looks weird but believe me it works.  Have gone&lt;br /&gt;from 6-8 Depends a day to one or none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried another product called Regain; it was uncomfortable and didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> Work well.  I&#x27;ve purchased several times.  They last 3-4 months</li>
