<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this fragrance and am not able to buy it locally in the small town I live in.  Also, the price was great.</li>
    <li> Great deal! Love the fragrance!  Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift for someone. I don&#x27;t really know how it smells but the person had used it before and really liked it. The packaging  is good- it came with the external transparent wrapping/seal. I also think the price is good for this product.</li>
    <li> Great all around but more of a night time fragrance. Everyone asks what I&#x27;m wearing. Great buy! Will buy again</li>
    <li> I have worn Provocative perfume for several years and was sorry that I can no longer find it in the stores.  I did order some from Amazon last year with no problem.  What I received this year was NOT Provocative.  Same bottle, same box, different content.  The Provoative I have been using is clear...This is amber.  This fragrance is mild, though not offensive...but it is not Provocative.  Who knows what I really received.  I would send it back but it is too much trouble.  I am disappointed!</li>
    <li> I am a total perfume lover! I love scents from Gucci, Narciso Rodriguez, Armani, Channel. This perfume from Elizabeth Arden is much cheaper, but smells great!&lt;br /&gt;I receive so many compliments whenrever I wera it, especially from men ;)</li>
    <li> I have been using this fragrance for several years and the best price for it I have found with Amazon.com. I have had to be careful about strong fragrances, as I am prone to severe headaches that can last for several days. This parfum spray is just right for me.&lt;br /&gt;I sell many fragrances myself through another business, but Provocative by Elizabeth Arden is the one I stay with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for a couple of years,  I always get compliment from people, love it!</li>
    <li> Any of the products by Elizabeth Areden for women are excellent.  The price was good in comparison to the department store.</li>
    <li> My daughter and granddaughter found/purchased this scent for me about 4 yrs ago for Mother&#x27;s Day.  I loved the fact that they chose it together with me in mind, but I really love the nailed what I like.  I light, sexy, classy fragrance.  Florals but not too sweet.  I visited major mall recently and no one carried this -I was shocked.  So yeah to Amazon for having a vendor from which to order.</li>
    <li> (And the &amp;#34;bug spray description was from my husband...) Maybe it smells better on other women, but even out of the bottle, this reeks. I&#x27;m thankful it was inexpensive because I won&#x27;t feel too bad tossing it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for someone who couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.  It was exactly what she wanted, shipped in the predicted time frame and arrived intact (bottle didn&#x27;t break, no leaking etc...).</li>
    <li> I got this fragrance for my mom a couple of years ago (she&#x27;s a Arden Fiend) and she loved it and I didn&#x27;t find it half-bad either. This flowery fragrance is sure to allure and amaze for it&#x27;s . . . PROVOCATIVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s high notes include rose, jasmine, and cassis&lt;br /&gt;*Mid-notes include peach, lemon, and bergamot (a common ingredient in Earl Grey tea)&lt;br /&gt;*Low notes included sandalwood, amber and white musk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips/Suggestions/Comments inolving Provocative:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s a fragrance of moderate strength . .Not too subtle and not too intense . .Jussstt right~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It lasts around the same time as most perfumes (which is around 8 hours)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) This perfume, as Amazon said, is most good for evening use (though I think you could pass off with using it casually)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) I&#x27;d say this pefume is more for adults than teens . .I just think adults would appreciate it more, that&#x27;s all . . .Though teens could like it too I guess (there are always exceptions to everything, right?)</li>
    <li> Perfume was a cheap imitation of the perfume I have used for 6 years. Even the bottle was different. Company&#x27;s return policy for knock off items is for you to give them a blank credit card authorization so that they can charge you $250 if their lab doesn&#x27;t agree! Finally, Amazon did credit my money.</li>
    <li> this perfume smells so good to me! it has a somewhat sweet yet mellow scent to it. it comes in an edgy bottle far from the typical circular ones and the scent lasts long i spray my sheets with it for a light touch!</li>
    <li> A+++++ Seller 😆😆😆&lt;br /&gt;Product packaging, price, shipping speed, quality of product was perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Love this perfume. It outdoes my high end perfumes. I receive so many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Will be purchasing again!!!!!</li>
    <li> delivered in one day.. WOWIE&lt;br /&gt;this is a very light perfume good for day wear &amp; who don&#x27;t like strong smells..&lt;br /&gt;This is my second one</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume in August 2011 as a birdday gift for a very special person. After I last saw her back in September I have not had any further conversation until today. I asked her how much she liked my gift, and to my surprise she said that the product did no seemed to be legit, the fragrance smell mostly like alcohol, that this perfume was not what she had used in the past. I finished the conversation and felt ashamed and embarased, I did not know that Amazon could sell something like my friend discribed to me.</li>
    <li> I received my fragrance quickly and the package included bonus body lotion; a lovely surprise. The packaging was well padded to protect the glass container.</li>
    <li> My favorite for years!!!! It&#x27;s my scent.</li>
    <li> great price. speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> Great I like it and can not find it locally.</li>
    <li> This is by FAR my favorite scent to wear! I get compliments every time that I wear it!  It came quicker than I thought that it would and the bottle was in pristine condition!</li>
    <li> Best price in town. Was shocked to find out it&#x27;s the real thing for the price I paid. I was truly expecting a knock off of the Real thing.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Im still using it.... smells wonderfully on my skin :) would recommend others to buy this item.... thank you</li>
    <li> This ruins me for all other fragrances.</li>
    <li> Just what I order.  No surprises.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Ita strong in the beginning it has a manly scent to it after fifteen minutes i couldnt smell it anymire but received compliments all day when i put it on ..its soft and sensual</li>
    <li> Product as expected. Timely delivery.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> It does not smell as fresh as he smaller bottles and it has a darker color to it, This in the past has always meant the perfume was old</li>
    <li> My wife has been using Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s \\&quot;Provocative\\&quot; perfume for several years...but it&#x27;s always so expensive. (Yes, I know...she&#x27;s worth it...but still...) But this past Christmas I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the local stores, so I made a last ditch effort by looking at Amazon...and there it was!  And for MUCH LESS than I usually had to spend. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife and all I can say is wwwwwoooooww[...] I love when My wife puts this on. Makes me wanna take her and ....... well you get the idea.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Ordered it online because its cheaper.</li>
    <li> After my small bottle was empty I found a replacement that also has a lotion to go with it. Both are great. When I checked online to find more of it I got very lucky. This 3.3 oz would sell for up to 4 times in the local stores.&lt;br /&gt;This will last for a long time. I&#x27;m one happy shopper!</li>
    <li> was a gift for my bff  She loves this perfume</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the price, the service, and the large bottle that was offered. Thanks for making this a great experience.  I&#x27;ll be back</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product on a regular basis.  This is a terrific buy for a great product.  We saved well over 50% for what she usually pays for this product.  Thx for the wonderful deal!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Hope its not a fake smell does not hold like the bottle I had before</li>
    <li> Great price - arrived timely.  This is something that my wife gets every year for her birthday and it last just long enough.</li>
    <li> this has become my everyday wear. great smell</li>
    <li> This was a great bargain!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Provocative by Elizabeth Arden for years and being able to order it and have it within just a few days was so convenient .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is Provocative Women in this bottle! Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as my other. The pkg. looks almost the same, but the scent is a Smidge off. It&#x27;s not worth sending back. I hope the sent grows on me because I L O V E the original Provocative Women by Elizabeth Arden......</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and it is not sold in the stores any longer (or at least I can&#x27;t find it) I purchased 2 bottles and it shipped quickly.  The perfume was clear so it wasn&#x27;t old or anything.  I am so glad I found this on Amazon, I feel like a new woman with my favorite smell back.  Thank You</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so amazing! I found it 10+ years ago and finally bought some, it&#x27;s amazing and you only need a little bit to go a long way.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years and I still love it! It is sooo nice! Even when I walk passed people they always ask me what perfume I am wearing because I smell so sexy!</li>

    <li> I love this perfume and I tru;y l;ove the price through Amazon.  I will continue to purchase it!</li>
    <li> Ts a matured scent and it carries the name in it provocative woman. The scent provokes actually n it lasts</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t think this is real. It DOES NOT Smell like my wife Org one. I will NOT be buying this again. I would goto a real DEPT store and buy the real deal.</li>
    <li> This perfume has been out for quite a while but I still use it quite often.  Clean feminine scent without beeing too floral.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite smells of all time. Came way fast to.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and excellent product</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and my friend just told me it smells like alcohol!  No perfume sent at all.  It must be old and ruined.  She thought I gave her an old bottle from my closet!  Never buy from this site.</li>
    <li> I got my item right on time! I love it. It came in the same box all packaged and in the original plastic and smells exactly like I remeber (: thank you. I will repurchase!</li>
