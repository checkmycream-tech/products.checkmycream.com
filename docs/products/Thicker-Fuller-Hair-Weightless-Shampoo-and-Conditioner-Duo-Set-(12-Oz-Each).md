      <li>so far so good, my hair feels soft after using this product, and I really think I lose less hair now...</li>
      <li>Works well on my long fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I am not a young person I am in my early 70&#x27;s so as most pople know your hair changes as we get older and I Hve tried so many other shampoo&#x27;s .None</li>
      <li>I was really hoping for an increase in body and fullness for my fine, limp hair, but other than a nice fragrance, I haven&#x27;t noticed much.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> so far so good, my hair feels soft after using this product, and I really think I lose less hair now...</li>
    <li> I have a closet full of half-used shampoos and conditioners; these are the first products I&#x27;ve used all the way through and bought again and again, at least in many years. I started buying it on Amazon because finding it in stores has been hit or miss. The conditioner is always the key for my hair (kind of limp, smooth hair, I guess), and this one is not too heavy, not too light. Smells nice but no heavy perfume.</li>
    <li> I first used this shampoo and conditioner duo MANY MANY years ago ( like over 15). Than I went through an awful time where I could not find it in stores. I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and had to immediately buy it. I was so impressed when it was just as good as I remembered it being. This does provide thicker and more resilient hair when used religiously. It does not have much of a smell but I am pleased enough with the results to not worry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shampoos over the years on my fine hair, and this is the only one that actually works for me.  I won&#x27;t use anything else anymore.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Aweome thickening product and helps hair grow!!!!!</li>
    <li> Ive been using it for about 2 weeks and my breakage is about 95% better I cant tell if its thicker cuz I bleached my hair and thats the reason I had such bad breakage I gave it 4 starts cuz of the smell its not terrible just not my favorite but all in all its a good product I will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Love it, my hair falls much less now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had really fine, thin hair that takes forever to grow. I&#x27;m used to using basic shampoo brands (pantene/garnier) have even tried brands bought from my salon, but have never been impressed with anything. I figured I&#x27;d give this product a try, and so far I can tell a difference. Nothing exhilarating, but it&#x27;s been about a week now and it has definitely grown, and feels a little bit fuller (especially right after I blow dry it). Hopefully it keeps improving.</li>
    <li> These products are very good,&lt;br /&gt;love that it does  seem to thicken my hair and give it more body.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference after three weeks. Wish the nice smell lingered but it goes away quickly after the wash.</li>
    <li> The smell is... interesting. Mostly you&#x27;ll have dirty scalp smell but what the product does is amazing so I put up with it. Flat and sweet aroma in my hair or full, beautiful smelly hair? I may use it off and on so I can have both worlds.</li>
    <li> Love this product, This Shampoo and Conditioner brought my hair back to life. Before using this product my hair was thin and falling out every time I took a shower. The first time I used this I notice a BIG Difference. My hair stop falling and my hair got its life back. Plus the Shampoo and Conditioner smells good I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is a good duo if you have fine or thin hair.  It&#x27;s not quite as good as some of the more expensive products but works for me.  12 oz bottles last forever.</li>
    <li> hair feels really soft &amp; looks beautiful, combo pack always rocks. will hopefully have much thicker hair soon :)</li>
    <li> Used to be my favorite product but the formula has changed so it&#x27;s not quite the same. I still like it and use it but there are others I&#x27;m sure that are just as good. Don&#x27;t know why companies have to mess with a winner.</li>
    <li> Actually makes my hair fuller and thicker with less hair falling out. Nice and soft too. No odor. Definitely worth it</li>
    <li> It came so quick! I really enjoy! Seems like my hair is fuller when I use it!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and its the best!  Hair shines and feels soft, but still hods its curl.</li>
    <li> I love love love this shampoo.It really does work, I&#x27; m on my second bottle now.I about a month ago bought another brand but it made my hair really shiny but it did not an I mean did not make my hair thick looking it made it flat so I came back to ths shampoo and I will continue to use it.I am not a young person I am in my early 70&#x27;s so as most pople know your hair changes as we get older and I Hve tried so many other shampoo&#x27;s .None and I men none hav worked as good as this one had.Yes I think anyone who buys this shampoo will be very pleased.</li>
    <li> This entire product line works wonders on my fine limp hair. Smells great too. Better than expensive salon products I&#x27;ve bought and had little to no results.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this set a try after using Jason Thin to Thick and being quite unimpressed with the results (or lack thereof). I have naturally curly, but very thin hair (presumably from genetics) and have been looking for a solution. This stuff works! I wash my hair every other day/every two days and have been using the shampoo &amp; conditioner for over a month now, and I have noticed a definite increase in the appearance and feel of fuller, thicker hair. The only reason why I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the shampoo is not sulfate-free. But if they change that, then it will be 5 stars from me!</li>
    <li> i love this because it really works...&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for years..&lt;br /&gt;It really does make your hair fuller..</li>
    <li> I feel improvement in my hair and I just received my second order. I like it Today I visited in some mall and I found this shamboo and conditioner and I am shocked it is $3.50  each both are $ 7+tax</li>
    <li> I buy this for my husband, and he is sold on this, he has been using it for years, and it does wonders for his hair, He will not be without it. It makes his hair soft but thick and the style stays all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 5 years with excellent results!  My hair line has moved back about an inch and my crown scalp shows when my hair is wet.  And the rest of the top of the hair is showing some thinning as well.  When I use any other shampoo/conditioner it is noticeable.  But Thicker Fuller Hair actually makes my hair totally filled in.  I look maybe 20 years younger...  The scent is nice too.  It&#x27;s kind of a herbal citrus.  It doesn&#x27;t have a medicinal smell, nor a feminine one... I like to add a bit of tea tree oil to the shampoo and it cures any dandruff as well.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> For fine hair is the best.  Combine this duo with the serum and there&#x27;s thickness and volume as you wish.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping for an increase in body and fullness for my fine, limp hair, but other than a nice fragrance, I haven&#x27;t noticed much.  I probably won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> I had used this product in the past but hadn&#x27;t seen it for years. When I stumbled upon it on Amazon, I was happily surprised! And the price is excellent! I even purchased the shampoo &amp; conditioner and am extremely pleased with the results!!</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo but didn&#x27;t mean to order the conditioner....I thought I was ordering (2) two bottles of shampoo; my hair is fine and this shampoo makes a difference.</li>
    <li> this does give me hair some body, i have straight long hair.  but it makes what frizz i have even frizzier, kinda dries my hair even when conditioner is used. i  do not plan on buying again.</li>
    <li> worked for my hair which was falling out and now has stopped,hair feels thicker and fuller</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I used it every time in the shower until the bottles were empty and I did not see any improvements. I have thinning hair and I did not see any noticeable differences. For those who expect the shampoo and conditioner to make their hair to look fuller and to improve/reverse the signs of thinning hair, DO NOT BUY THIS! Save your money</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!! Im recommending this everyone I know! I had some hair thinning issues on the side of my head and right in the middle of my head. I was mortified!! I used this product for only one week noticed a huge difference. My hair healthier and not falling out as much. It&#x27;s a great product for the price!</li>
    <li> You can pretty much see thickness the first week of use.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to do a full wash about 2-3 times a week, am a male, 21 and could notice some hair thinning.&lt;br /&gt;This pretty much made the black color of my hair stand out much more and my hair strands have thickened and possibly even stronger from what I&#x27;ve noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAFFEINE LOVER!!!&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and order the SET, not just the shampoo!</li>
    <li> love the stuff...thicker hair so much that my daughter said I needed a hair cut!!  I will be buying more</li>
    <li> Nice product, goes a long way!!! hair does feel fuller.</li>
    <li> made my hair oily and flat. probably would be nice for a person that has dry bushy hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for flat thinning oily hair heads.</li>
    <li> Really does help your hair look fuller and helps the hair lift from the scalp.</li>
    <li> I bought this  shampoo /conditioner combo thinking that it would stop my hair loss and thicken my hair but  so far it has done nothing other than make it sleek and shiny. I was disappointed with the product.....too bad  it  didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Great product and delivery, this is our second order.</li>
    <li> Have not noticed a difference...yet.</li>
    <li> Works great.  The conditioner really makes a difference.  3 months of taking pills and I didn&#x27;t notice anything.  1 use and my hair was thicker when it was still wet.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell but thickens the hair somewhat</li>
    <li> I love it!! My hair is fine texture and it makes it feel fuller without stripping my hair shaft.  Best price was here at Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> It makes my fine hair have more texture.  The smell is not one of my favs but I can stand it this is why I gave it only 4 stars.  I have always like Swartzkopf&#x27;s products and this does not dissapoint.  Really good for the price.  Hair products are so expensive nowadays.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 26 years old with dark brown, wavy medium thick long (past my waist) hair.  I was experiencing some recent hair loss and wanted a product to thicken my hair and make it stronger.  I&#x27;m so pleased with how well this product works! Not only did it strengthen my hair, it is a great detangle product! I used to struggle to brush my hair every time I&#x27;d wash it and now its super fast.  I wash my hair every other day with the shampoo and conditioner, then switch to maybe conditioner in between.  I recommend this to anyone! Plus, it smells great!</li>
    <li> Works well on my long fine hair.  Good shine</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while and I can see an immense difference in the length of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came in larger bottles!</li>
    <li> Ehh it&#x27;s okay, not sure it&#x27;s working yet and I&#x27;m thrilled with the smell...but time will tell!! Good for price.</li>
    <li> I struggled with depression after my pregnancy, and my hair fell out.  This product not only thickened my hair but also grew it.  Truly is a miracle.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about three weeks now.</li>
    <li> Great products!  My hair was getting very thin and fly away. These products have made my hair look and feel thicker and much more easy to manage.  I&#x27;m glad a family member recommended it to me.</li>
    <li> You can get this at fredmeyer for $4 a bottle,  same size. It hasn&#x27;t done anything to my hair at all. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of weeks ago and have used it daily. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any change to my hair yet. There really isn&#x27;t any great smell to either the shampoo or conditioner. I really do love how soft the conditioner makes my hair however. Better than any other conditioner I&#x27;ve bought from a drug store.</li>
    <li> I have really thin hair, this stuff works great! I recommend the conditioner they are a really good combo together.</li>
    <li> Great product , arrive on time.</li>
    <li> Great stuff nice smell</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so perfect! I have only used it twice so I haven&#x27;t seen much hair thickening results, but my hair is shiny and soft and vibrant! My favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed!! I have fine hair this shampoo leaves my hair very soft and limp with no noticeable volume added.  A few years ago Thicker Filler Hair was the best shampoo for added volume.  They must have changed the formula.</li>
    <li> 1st time i tryed this product it made alot of my hair fall out. luckily i have alot of hair, but i recomend if you wanna keep your hair, dont buy this product</li>
    <li> I think this shampoo works , I have joust bought my second set . My hair used to fall out a lot every time I washed it ... Now that the bottle is at the end I have noticed the difference .... I&#x27;m hoping that it is the shampoo .</li>
