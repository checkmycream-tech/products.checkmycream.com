<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Maybe it does not fir my hairs ( I have very thin hairs) but it make them electric and as a consequence it is not so easy to use...</li>
    <li> Nice Brush! Very Light weight and great size for brushing your hair well to distribute your natural oil and avoid the hair breaking.&lt;br /&gt;I had to order more so my family can have their own and not take mine.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush!</li>
    <li> For the sake of context, I have long, straight-ish, coarse thick auburn hair.  Despite my straight hair, my frizz gets completely out of control.  I have burned through the entire salon aisle of anti-frizz products, and only two work even a little:  that $10/shower Living Proof stuff, and a discontinued VO5 product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, it&#x27;s a fairly desperate situation.  No one with naturally straight hair should look like Princess Merida or Ms. Frizzle.  Or Mufasa, with that regal mane of his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my doubts, but this also helps.  I fortunately found a decent blog article that advised to brush for about 5 min/day, and to keep at it for a little while even though the instant static makes it look worse at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing my hair sets me back a bit each time, but there&#x27;s no question things have improved.  I keep this by the couch and brush while watching TV.  It&#x27;s pretty worthless for detangling or styling.  I use it only to put a smoother finish on my hair, and to fight the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with your hairy endeavors!</li>
    <li> I liked this brush enough to send back the first one that began flaking its darker stain (I&#x27;m guessing that was what was flaking) within weeks of receiving and using it. I received a replacement and it started again. I wasn&#x27;t about to get another replacement and was disappointed the customer service didn&#x27;t credit my account.</li>
    <li> IT is what I expected,  but it took some time to ship,  longer then I expected</li>
    <li> Nice brush for my husband.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. Do not be fulled by other &amp;#34;100%&amp;#34; boar bristle brushes that end up being a mix of nylon. This brush is truly 100% boar bristle, and for the price you can not go wrong! I&#x27;ve used this brush everyday, 3 times a day, and my hair has never been softer. As a bonus I&#x27;ve noticed an improve in hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 100% boar bristle brush&#x27;s main purpose is to take your natural oils produced from your roots and to spread it evenly to the rest of your hair. It will not detangle longer hair, expect to use a seperate brush afterwards. So to address the reviews stating it&#x27;s bristles are too soft to comb throughout your hair, what you&#x27;re most likely wanting is a mix of nylon/boar bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush not thinking what it would or would not do. I absolutely love this brush. I think that sez it all. Why would you pay a couple of hundred dollars when this one is so great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several boar bristle brushes and like this one the best.  The bristles are  not too dense, do not scratch, and seem to be easy on my thinning hair.  What more could a girl want?!</li>
    <li> nice brush. takes longer to brush my hair</li>
    <li> The perfect brush to take care of unruly hair.</li>
    <li> This brush got to my house so fast! Although the packaging for it was a bit rough and i was concerned whether the brush made it or not, when i opened it my brush was new and in great shape! This brush is awesome. A massage when blow drying your hair and a great brush for when trying to grow hair out to keep it healthy! A great purchase!</li>
    <li> I am trying a no shampoo method and this brush was recommended. It has helped my journey to go without shampoo as it distributes the oils evenly through my hair.</li>
    <li> too soft unless you have short, fine hair &amp; very cumbersome to use</li>
    <li> I have long, straight, fine hair. I don&#x27;t need to wash it every day, but I brought this brush to use on my off-days so that the natural oils from my scalp would be distributed to the ends of my hair.  At first, the brush just made my hair really static-y. Annoying, but I could deal with it. Now, brushing my hair from the top down made the hair on the top of my head very, very shiny...but slicked down flat as a pancake. It looked gross--like my hair was much dirtier than it actually was. Maybe someone with thicker, drier hair would have better luck. As it is, I&#x27;m stuck with a brush I can&#x27;t return but don&#x27;t want to use.</li>
    <li> This brush is sturdy and well made but it gives my hair slot of static.  It is also not very good for styling in that it won&#x27;t pick up my hair at the roots which I need to do in order the create fullness.  I&#x27;ll be giving this one away.</li>
    <li> Great hairbrush - once you go with boar bristle, you&#x27;ll never go back! This is well constructed and easy to clean. Very good brush for the price.</li>
    <li> great for a boar bristle brush..</li>
    <li> I like it but really don&#x27;t use it very often. My problem. I just don&#x27;t feel that the bristles reach the scalp and maybe they are not suppose to. I bought it because hair dressers suggest using 100% Boar Bristle to avoid breakage, avoid split ends, etc. to your hair.</li>
    <li> The bristles are not firm enough for anything other than very fine hair (or maybe short hair), and I have never had a brush that left my hair so full of static electricity.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to the bristles or the cushion, or if it will improve once the brush has some natural oils on it.  In any case, I&#x27;m not too happy with this purchase.  Then again, I was looking for a cheap alternative to my Mason Pearson brush, and it&#x27;s hard to compare a $16 product with a $180 product!  If you have the budget for one of those, they&#x27;re amazing... mine has been in constant use since 1992, and is still in great shape.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the price &amp; the quality of the brush.</li>
    <li> POOR QUALITY.  BRISTLES FALLING OUT.</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy and and thick so it&#x27;s really hard to make it soft but this brush made it soft and nice :)</li>
    <li> I am a diehard Mason Pearson fan but the price sometimes goes into the ridiculous range, when I need a new brush. This time I am glad - The Spronette DeVille does the job, gently and  richly and I am pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice brush, it&#x27;s light and easy to handle and fits nicely in my hand while I am brushing my hair.</li>
    <li> Ahhh feels great on my scalp and my hair loves it. Makes my hair look soft and shiny.  My &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; when my hair&#x27;s looking blah - it always helps.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying using the brush.  Problem is, is it going to last?  As I brush, bristles fall out.  I have found them in the floor and counter and when I clean the hair out of the brush, bristles come out.  Are boar bristle brushes supposed to do that?  Anyhow, I like it overall.  Nice handle and body.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best brush ever. I like 100 percent boat bristles and this brush is exactly that. When I brush my hair it feels so good on my scalp. Yo can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
    <li> I had a old Conair brush that I loved for years (too many) because the bristles were the perfect combination of not to stiff and not to soft for my short hair. This brush was the perfect replacement!</li>
    <li> Not meant for thicker hair.  I have trouble brushing my hair with the brush because the bristles are too short and soft to reach my scalp.</li>
    <li> This is a good brush but I actually prefer the Bass brush I purchased simultaneously since this one has fewer boar bristles overall and even synthetic ones mixed in. Perhaps preferable for anyone with long or soft hair; but I am a man with short, coarse hair and the Bass brush has more and is comprised of 100% boar bristles on a smaller brush head, which is perfect for hair like mine.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I really really really wanted to love this product. I paid 20 bucks for it and I hate returning stuff so yes, I really wanted to love it . So it makes my hair shiny which is cool...but only the outside...The bristles are not strong? or long? or whatever enough to hit my scalp or my inner layers. But that&#x27;s my fault. In reading reviews, this brush is apparently better suited to fine/thin  hair. I do have fine hair...but I have A LOT of it. So i guess I have thick hair? I don&#x27;t know because I&#x27;m no hair guru. I&#x27;m just a girl with google. So my advice to all those girls with thick hair, A LOT of thin hair, or basically anyone who doesn&#x27;t have super thin/ fine hair, GET A SPORNETTE PORCUPINE BRUSH or some other boar/nylon mix cause this spornette 100% boar bristle won&#x27;t do the job. Unless you&#x27;re okay with only your outside layers being brushed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, that static though. I thought i was going to be struck by lightning any moment. I was a rocking an afro the entire day. YIKES</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cool. sometimes it makes your hair fuzzy though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several boar bristle brushes over the years, so I know what to expect and this one definitely falls short.  Upon opening the box, I noticed a few loose bristles in the clear plastic bag containing the brush.  As I removed the brush from the bag, there was a strong rubber odor similar to that of automobile tires.  I&#x27;m guessing the smell emanates from the &amp;#34;cushion&amp;#34; which holds the bristles, but whatever is, I wouldn&#x27;t want to rub that stink through my hair.  Also, as I handled the brush and ran my thumb over the bristles, several more fell out.  I don&#x27;t know if the shedding is normal for this brand, but I&#x27;ve never had it happen with other brushes.</li>
    <li> My friends keep using my brush because it makes the hair so soft. I have long thick hair and this brush handles it perfectly. Disperses the hair&#x27;s natural oils and gives body when needed.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by this brush.  I was gifted with a boars head brush over 10 years ago and it was an amazing brush!  I guess I thought all boars head brushes were the same, but I was wrong.  This brush doesn&#x27;t have any strength in the bristles.</li>
    <li> This brush works well for me. I have slightly thick hair so when I use it I feel like the bristles are not going deep enough. But the end result is good and solves my main problem of frizz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this brush for a few months now and it&#x27;s a great size and quality, just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS HAIR BRUSH.  iT FIRT MY HANDS WELL.  I&#x27;ve WASHED MINE SEVERAL TIMES AND SO FAR I&#x27;ve HAD NO PEELING OF THE VARNISH ON THE WOOD.  I LIKED IT SO MUCH I BOUGHT A SECOND ONE.  I AM ENJOYING THEM.</li>
    <li> This brush has made a huge difference in how my hair looks. Another plus, my kids don&#x27;t yell and scream when I&#x27;m brushing their hair anymore.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush because boar bristles are recommended for brushing hair, but I find the bristles to be too soft for my taste.  Nothing wrong with it - I find that I just prefer a stiffer bristle.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a brush. I always use a wide tooth comb for my long thinning hair. I did some research on boar brushes and they said it is very good in stimulating the blood circulation in the scalp and keeping the hair clean and falling hair at bay. I have been brushing my hair every night since I got this brush and it feels like someone&#x27;s massaging my head! The size is perfect!</li>
    <li> Great brush! I have very fine, thin hair and I was worried that this brush might harm it. It works wonders! Evenly distributes my scalp oils and has noticeably changed my hair. I have even been told that my pony tail looks thicker by multiple people! The brush does require some maintenance, as dusty sebum will build up in it. Wash it with a mild cleanser and warm water to clean it up. When wet, it has a strange smell, but it is just the result of having the real boar hairs. The smell disappears completely once dry.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this brush to anyone who wants to have healthier hair!</li>
    <li> I have thin straight hair and this brush immediately made it full of static.  Needless to say, I never used it again.  It may work better for thicker hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is excellent - much stiffer than I thought it would be, which is what I need to remove tangles from my long hair. If you have thinner hair, probably go for something a bit softer, but this is perfect for mine. Note it will cause some static so maybe try with a smoothing cream</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had the several-hundred-dollar version so I can&#x27;t compare but I can report that this brush is the bomb for me. It took several months but brushing my hair with this brush has definitely improved it. More shiny, less dry and healthy enough to skip a day in shampooing makes this a winner in my arsenal.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> Nice quality. Much gentler on my 3-year-old daughter&#x27;s boogery bed head than a regular brush. One less thing to fight about in the morning.</li>
    <li> Great brush especially for relaxed hair. A must buy!!!</li>
    <li> PRO: Hair feels shiner and sleeker with use.&lt;br /&gt;CON: Color of wood is uneven, high price given quality&lt;br /&gt;Hair does not reach scalp, need to a lot of pressure to use</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I was told that Boar Bristles stimulate your hair follicles and will promote new hair growth.  I wanted to try it out.  I&#x27;m a pleasantly surprised how much I like this brush.  I thought it was a bit expensive, but for now I see it&#x27;s worth the money.  Time will tell for sure I guess, but either way I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> The brush has give and manages to do a fairly good job of getting through thick hair. It also cuts down on the static when brushing.</li>
    <li> nice brush - makes my brushing my love&#x27;s hair pleasurable to her. satin finish on nicely sculpted wood, good quality boar bristles. very good value for price.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be better on hair, and I have to say, it does seem to add shine.  I have thick hair, and it does not really brush past the top layer of my hair.  I like it, but it really causes static, maybe a dryer sheet run over it would help that problem.  That being said, I use it, and would say for the price, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> this is a really great hair brush!!!</li>
    <li> Quality was excellent. Perfect for fine easily tangled hair. This was a lifesaver to be able to brush my 6 year olds hair without tears.</li>
    <li> It was difficult finding the right brush online. Often descriptions were inaccurate or incomplete. This is my 3rd one of these brushes in about 12 years. Here&#x27;s what I know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This version of the brush (Spornette DeVille #342) has 100% boar bristles just under an inch in length. They are inserted into a rubber cushion. The bristles are of varied thicknesses and stiffness, but the overall stiffness is probably a medium to medium-soft. The bristles soften with use. This type of brush is good for fine and/or thinning hair. It feels comfortable on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is wood - some type of composite or fiberboard - and the exterior grain is embossed paper. My last brush held up well for several years (about 9). The first one was taken by a housekeeper from a hotel bathroom after I&#x27;d had it about 2 years.</li>
    <li> Purchased an Ambassador hairbrush first but it was too small for my hand.  This DeVille is perfect size and fit for my hand.  The bristles are a bit stiff and after using daily for a few months the bristles are beginning to soften.  I think this brush will last me many years.</li>
    <li> First impressions...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m a black woman and I&#x27;m starting my HHJ(healthy hair journey). Recently I cut my hair (I went from shoulder length to chin length) due to breakage and damage. I&#x27;ve been reading about boar bristle brushes for a while and came across this. I COULD have bought a cheaper brush, but that could have caused more damage. So just based on first impressions, this is a really good brush. My hair felt soft and manageable. I have dandruff and I used medications from my dermatologist, I used this brush on a clean dry scalp and it felt amazing. It made my scalp tingle a bit. I know this brush is a little pricey but you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush, comfortable handle, feels really good when brushing hair.</li>
    <li> Love my new brushes,I bought two,nice weight,and they wash up very nicely.Brushing my hair gives a perfect scalp massage and makes my hair shine like new money, very,happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> I love this natural bristle brush. The brush pad is large and the cushion creates a small dome shape. It is a nice feel on my long very fine hair. I like that the bristles are gentle and therefore do not over-stretch and damage my hair like stiff plastic brushes. Morning and evening brushing is a pleasure and it collects falling hair, so there is less hair being shed on my clothes. The hair collected on the brush are easy to remove from the brush by squeezing my fingers from the outside bristle to the center. Very good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush after doing research on the benefits of boar bristle brushes on dry hair. I started using this brush and could tell a drastic difference in my hair and scalp. On the quality of the brush, it is great! It has held up amazingly with my thick hair and I&#x27;m very pleased with my product! I would purchase again!</li>
    <li> beautiful brush.  I have very fine hair and it works beautifully.  Make my hair really shiny.</li>
    <li> It works well for my thick wavy hair. I recently went natural with my hair (like in no sulfates and silicones) and lot of people suggested the boar bristle brush and the top rated is really expensive. so looked up on amazon and this brush has good reviews and good price too and works well.</li>
    <li> This brush is fine, but the description is not accurate. My guess is that only 10% of the bristles are boar and the rest are plastic.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love it</li>
    <li> Very good. does what it says !!</li>
    <li> this brush is actually 100% boar bristles as described.  Wonderful smooth brush.  The only thing that might be an improvement is the base and handle be made of real wood, but in any case it is also a nice looking brush.  Most importantly it works and does the job well and is kind to my hair.</li>
    <li> Great price for an excellent brush!</li>
    <li> This is a great boar bristle bristle brush at a reasonable cost!  I would definitely buy it again! Gentle on your hair</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this nice soft bruch</li>
    <li> Really like the handling of the brush and the feeling on my scalp I just wish it could brush more into my hair rather than just my edges.</li>
    <li> Not only is this a beautiful brush but it really feels good on scalp!  Boar bristle used to signal quality and it sure does with this one.  It feels like it is brushing through every strand of your hair!  The brush itself is hardwood, very smooth finish and comfortable in your hand.  The bristle side is cushioned also..so you don&#x27;t poke the bristles into yr head!  Says made in China but this is a really nice brush</li>
    <li> This is a good quality hairbrush for all hair types. Leaves hair soft and shining because of the natural bristles that are just the right degree of texture. I looked at many brushes before choosing this one and am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I like this brush a lot. I can tell a difference when I consistently use it. My hair is less oily and softer.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a special gift for a female friend she loves it says it is the best hair brush she has ever had. Does not break the hair off and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I love this brush it really does a good job on my hair and it leaves it without a tangle!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the performance. Five stars. Will recommend this other family members and friends, what else do you have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m considered a brush snob because I want my brush to do more than just straighten my hair, I want a scalp massage to.  My hair and some of my girls hair is really thick so we have to use a brush with less tines first but then the boar bristle brush does a great job of stimulating the scalp and taking care of the hair.  It&#x27;s easy to clean the hair out also.</li>
    <li> This brush has mostly nylon bristles with a few boar hairs. The varnish on the handle just cries out \\&quot;watch me flake!\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t even try it on my hair because I have tried one of these slightly boar brushes before and the nylon bristles scratch my scalp and leave me with sores. I am returning it and will buy a brush in a store where I can look at the bristles and see what I am getting.</li>
    <li> This is the brush my order history said I purchased, but the brush I received looks different. The one I received has a nice wooden handle with the Spornette insignia on it. It also has a hole at the end which comes in handy for hanging it on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product because from what I have read boar bristle brushes are supposed to be the best kind of brush for your hair. It arrived very quickly and was in perfect condition. My hair is naturally semi curly and wavy. It is kind of on the thin side and I have a real problem with frizz. Nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried has been able to tame my frizz. I like that this brush makes my hair super soft, but the static it produces is insane! Even when I use products like Static Guard it doesn&#x27;t get rid of all of the static. It probably is just because of my hair type though. I think I&#x27;d probably benefit more if I had a different hair type. It&#x27;s a very nice looking brush though and I still use it occasionally to help distribute the natural oils.</li>
    <li> I feel this is a good option for an inexpensive boar bristle brush.  The first week I used the brush two or three bristles would fall out each time I used it.  So my initial impression was not that great, I was a little disappointed.  But for whatever reason after those first several days the bristles stopped falling out and it hasn&#x27;t been an issue since.  It feels really nice on my scalp when I use the brush and it leaves my hair very soft and shiny.  I&#x27;ve always shied away from using brushes, feeling they must be too harsh on hair.  But I&#x27;m glad I finally started to use a natural bristle brush, it does seem to improve the condition of my hair.  I recently used a gentle soap and water mixture to clean the bristles and any doubt I had about whether they were real boar bristles quickly dissipated.  When the bristles get wet, man they stink so bad!  It&#x27;s like I could channel the image of this boar snorting it&#x27;s way through the forest.  But overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with the brush.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses it to maintain his bushy beard. I use it sometimes on my super fine hair and it leaves it with a nice silky smooth and soft finish.</li>
    <li> I like the natural boar hair to brush my hair because it makes my hair look glossier.  The more you use it the better it gets.</li>
    <li> I use this brush on a daily basis for my hair and for my son&#x27;s hair. I found this brush while looking for a replacement for my pink Goody brush (which I was unsuccessful). It helps smooth edges and brings luster to your hair. I personally would recommend this brush for those with ethnic backgrounds it may be too harsh for very fragile/thinning hair (just my opinion). I have a mixed hair type (3C-4B). The only downside is that when the wood gets wet it peels.</li>
    <li> Comfortable handle, doesn&#x27;t pull hair. Would purchase again .</li>
    <li> I had another boar-bristled brush that I kept way too long and decided to replace it with this one. So far, so good. I&#x27;m not having any issues with bristles falling out of the brush or breaking. If you are still using plastic-bristled brushes, you should try a good natural-bristled brush. There&#x27;s such a difference! You&#x27;ll find that your hair doesn&#x27;t break so much, and your natural oils are distributed more evenly through your hair. And remember the rule - Comb only for wet hair, brush only for dry.</li>
    <li> My mothers barber reccomended her to get a $100 plus name brand bore bristle brush and i found this one for a fraction of the cost.  It works just as good as the name brand expensive ones at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> The perfect travel brush- it fits standing up in my travel suitcase and is light weight.  It makes my hair look smooth and professionally done!</li>
    <li> The brush is awesome and does what I wanted it to do. Only thing is the finish on the brush after disinfecting it in a salon is starting to chip off. The whole back is gone now</li>
    <li> This brush was to replace one that had worn out from ten years ago and it was a perfect match.</li>
    <li> My son has curly hair and all I used to hear was, &amp;#34;OUUUUCCCHHH mommy that hurts&amp;#34;, when I brushed his hair. This brush is amazing, truly his hair brushes out effortlessly and he never complains anymore. A life saver for mom!!</li>
    <li> Was vary happy with it thank you</li>
    <li> I really like this brush! Nice grip, durable and wide. The texture is medium hard less split ends.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! My daughter who has always hated brushing her hair because she said it hurt has stolen the brush from me. She loves it and her hair has never looked so great highly recommended</li>
    <li> This brush is a high quality brush, sold at a reasonable price. I had previously purchased a brush from a different manufacturer, which cost twice as much, and was so unlike the advertised discription, that after one use, I threw it away. I try to comparison shop, for a good balance between quality and cost. I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this brush.</li>
    <li> A nice brush but very soft.  Really not good for thick hair.</li>
    <li> I used this brush for mu granddaughters very curly and fuzzy hair. For the first time she had shine in her hair and it behaved with out having to cement her hair with product. It did not do so well on my processed hair, but I really never expected that it would.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Not too hard or too soft.  Very well made.</li>
    <li> Brushes smoothly. Removes tangles without pulling hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. Liittle hard to clean though</li>
    <li> It fine tunes my hair</li>
    <li> I never really brushed my hair because those plastic brushes hurt.  Well, here is an affordable, comfortable, stimulating, beautiful brush!&lt;br /&gt; And am I brushing!  Hey, this is better than cookies for reducing stress!  Who Knew?&lt;br /&gt; I now have to get one for each bathroom and the TV room, and I want to buy them for my loved ones.&lt;br /&gt;And..I am getting compliments on my shiny hair,( that&#x27;s the boar bristle working.)&lt;br /&gt;I guess pigs had to be good for something.</li>
    <li> Distributes oils in dry hair very effectively. However, if your hair is TOO oily, it will just make that very obvious by spreading the oil all around your roots. My hair is healthier because of this brush, and it does a good job of combing out tangles and making the hair smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  It is 100 % boar........so it really smoothes out my hair!</li>
    <li> I have very long hair, I use this brush to help bring the oil from the top down to the ends of my hair, I have a special brush that I use with much stronger nylon bristles to get the initial tangles out, then I use this brush to bring down the oils, a perfect combo, especially if you have very long hair...</li>
    <li> I wanted a Mason Pearson but who can afford their prices!  Then I saw this and decided it was worth a tenner to try. My hair has a slight wave and is quite fine and this is soft enough to make it shiny but doesn&#x27;t scrape my sensitive scalp.  It is a nice weight, the bristles are set in a cushion and it got here in one day.  Seriously.  I ordered it yesterday morning!  So far, I love it and the SO says my hair looks lovely. I don&#x27;t ever brush my hair wet--I always use a wide-toothed wooden comb--so I don&#x27;t anticipate peeling finishes.  Will update in a few weeks but for now, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great price, nice and light wood handle and the bristles feel really good on my scalp! Leaves my hair feeling like silk!</li>
    <li> This is truly the best hair brush I have ever used!!  I have very long hair (more than four feet of it) and I have used boar bristle brushes for decades.  With the other ones I would still get a few tangles at the ends when brushing my hair but that&#x27;s not the case with this one!  Also, the bristles on the other brushes I&#x27;ve used were sharp, so I had to be careful when I handled them.  The bristles on this brush are surprisingly soft to the touch!  My follicles are the happiest they&#x27;ve ever been now that I have a new brush and this brush is so wonderful that I&#x27;m planning to give one to my mother as a Christmas present!</li>
    <li> This brush is gentle on your hair. I bought it after seeing it recommended in a magazine. I was very pleased withbthe quality of this brush</li>
    <li> I think this is a real decent brush for the money</li>
    <li> Love this Boar Bristle brus!h and so do my kids!  It feels great on the scalp and makes everyone&#x27;s hair so shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This brush feels so nice going through your hair. It makes it all smooth and soft. My hair is straight.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended a boar bristle brush - I had a tough time finding what I wanted in a local shop. This one works great and my hair feels amazing after a brushing. Highly recommend this one for longer hair.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002RL8NGI Spornette DeVille 100% Boar Bristle Oval Cushion Brush]]  By now we all know the importance of really REALLY taking care of our hair - at our scalp where it grows out and then the rest of it.  This brush feels like it really massages the scalp.  The boar bristles are a natural product and so absorb the natural oils from our hair and distribute it evenly and softly.  The handle has the perfect fit in my hand.  Now I turn my head upside down and brush and brush.  It is heavenly!  Look how my hair shines and what a great price for a wonderful brush.</li>
    <li> I bought a brush from a different and very expensive alternatve.  Frustrated, I quit using it; later, I read the importance of using boar bristles, and I decided to give this one a shot.  I really like it- it brushes through my thick, long hair much easier than the expensive brush.</li>
    <li> Received this in simple packaging - a plastic bag. However, the condition of the brush looked good. This is the most full boar bristle brush I&#x27;ve ever seen. Sadly, on my first use, the bristles started coming out with each brush stroke. Initially, I thought they were just lose bristles falling out. But I&#x27;ve used this several times, and each time, more bristles have fallen out. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll end up keeping this as I doubt I can return it. I&#x27;m just afraid it won&#x27;t be as full as when I first got it.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, quality construction. The one I had finally had collected too much lint to clean. The density of the bristles is about perfect.</li>
    <li> Bristles have no strength and don&#x27;t grab my hair.  I don&#x27;t have really thick hair and even so this brush does not pick up my hair.</li>
    <li> Bristles are pretty soft and don&#x27;t get through all my hair, but still works better than the new Bass brush I had bought this to replace!</li>
    <li> Hard to buy a brush for a family of five but this one made the grade-priced exceptionally well for how functional it is for all of us.</li>
    <li> This brush makes my hair super soft when using it and I would assume it helps to distribute the oil from my head to the ends of my hair.  It is not stiff, so not for detangling, but for smoothing.  It doesn&#x27;t do as much distributing as I had hoped it would but I still really like how soft it makes my hair.  It also makes it a bit staticky (I live in WI and it is winter/spring right now, so this may change based on the time of year).  Overall, I am glad I purchased this brush and I would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazingly soft and has improved the softness and fullness of my hair even on days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair.  It is very well made and easy to use to style hair.</li>
    <li> I took me some time to get used to it, but my hair looks much smoother after using this brush.</li>
    <li> I use this brush every day all day fabulous. Great product excellent service.</li>
    <li> It is a bit stiff for my thinning hair.  I would have preferred something a bit softer.</li>
    <li> Ive had this brush for about a week and I won&#x27;t ever do back to nylon! I have thick wavy hair and this brush gets to the scalp when I part my hair into sections. It spreads the oil evenly so I can go a couple days without washing and no one can tell. I have no idea what people are doing to this brush to make bristles fall out or whatever, but Im a brute and everything is still intact. Boar bristles get an A++ from me.</li>
    <li> It is a very nice quality brush that brings out the shine in my unpredictable and fickle hair. Shipped safely and within deadline.</li>
    <li> I decided to get this instead of the much more expensive Mason Pearson ones.  I love it.  I had no idea that a good boar&#x27;s hair brush could distribute oil so evenly and well. My hair actually looks cleaner longer because the oil doesn&#x27;t just stay deposited on the roots.  With that said, I have chin length hair, so I don&#x27;t know how it would work for long hair. But the wood is really top notch and it feels great in the hand.  I would have no problem buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> Good price, good quality and gentle on my hair. Not a superior brush but very worth the price you pay.</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair soft every time.  Using this on my daughter&#x27;s hair keeps her from pulling away from me.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair brushes a person can buy! Fantastic results if used daily. Brush while watching a TV show each night and your hair will benefit greatly! The 100% boar bristle is the reason why! This is a most agreeable price for this brush. Sells for twice as much in drugstores!</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to making this my go-to brush, but unfortunately, the bristles cannot reach my scalp.  I have thick straight hair with thick individual strands.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have ever owned, hands down.  The brush helps distribute the natural oils in my hair while detangling without pulling or breaking my hair.  I have thick hair, and I was able to really get into the layers.  Blow drying with this is a breeze.  The handle is very study and won&#x27;t break off.  Not a single bristle has come out since I bought it over a month ago.</li>
    <li> Nice brush. There is no sticker on the handle. I guess they don&#x27;t put in on there anymore. Feels good when I brush my hair like a massage.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m an old hippie with some top balding. I needed a brush that could get my hair managed without hurting my poor little head. This brush is very forgiving.</li>
    <li> This makes my long hair shine. I brought one for my older sister and she thanked me so much for it.</li>
    <li> Not that great for thick hair but manageable</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> great brush!  will recommend! well made, the the wood is beautiful and it feels good in your hand.  It&#x27;s finish reminds me of high end funiture.  In love with this brush!  So glad i took a chance on it!</li>
    <li> I love this brush, really helps with shine. I have very thick hair so I am rough on the brush but so far it has held up just fine. I will never use a normal brush again!</li>
    <li> I love the brush and love the price and fast delivery! It is the kind of brush if you don&#x27;t lose it you will have it for ever!</li>
    <li> This is a really good brush. Grips the hair really well so you get a smooth stroke.  Deep, soothing vibe to it. Well made.</li>
    <li> This is a good brush but as stated in other reviews, it is not 100% boar. However, if you are looking for a boar brush to detangle AND spread oils throughout your hair, you&#x27;d have better luck looking at porcupine brushes. Boar bristle brushes are meant to distribute oils though out your hair, not detangle. If you brush in sections and different angles after combing though your hair with a wide tooth comb or your fingers, you&#x27;ll have better success in doing so. But if you use your other hand as a wall and somewhat press your hair against the brush it CAN detangle small tangles. I have very thick and long hair and use the methods I stated and it works just well as a plastic brush does.</li>
    <li> this was just what i was looking for.  made well and bristles were not limp. very best brush i have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight, medium-length hair and a convertible.  This brush allows them to co-exist peacefully.&lt;br /&gt;(Best results when you&#x27;re gentle, work your way up in increments, and use it on dry hair.)</li>
    <li> This 100% Boar Bristle Brush was deliver fast, price was low, saved me time, gas and didn&#x27;t have to fight the crowds.</li>
    <li> Very soft brush &amp; seems to detangle hair as well!</li>
    <li> Shipping time was great. I wear wigs and my hair is natural it does wonders for both textured and straight hair.</li>
    <li> Not as happy with this as I had hoped....  Not really meant for fine hair....</li>
    <li> I have really long, fairly thick, naturally straight as a stick hair. I have to wash it every day because it&#x27;s rather oily. I thought this brush would help to disperse the oil down to create healthier bottoms to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is too thick, and I can&#x27;t get it all the way through. It also makes my hair VERY static-y. I don&#x27;t feel it has helped the oil problem in the least.&lt;br /&gt;The reason it gets some stars is because it doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair at all. It doesn&#x27;t break it or damage it, it won&#x27;t try to rip through a tangle. I try to take good care of my hair because it is so long and I can&#x27;t reverse any damage.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the brush is good. It&#x27;s a great size, and good weight. It&#x27;s really a quality brush as far as that&#x27;s concerned. It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m using this brush after having used a Mason Pearson. My Mason Pearson broke (my own fault, the bristles fell out after I decided to use it to distribute hair dye through my hair). I&#x27;m not in a position to buy an expensive brush and after reading the reviews here, I thought this was a good buy. I have blonde, straight, long hair that&#x27;s on the thicker side. This brush really doesn&#x27;t have enough strength to even reach my scalp in order to be effective. Also, this is for sure not getting any knots out of my hair, as is will just glide over. The worst part of this brush is that the brush is made from some cheap plastic wood looking covering that is peeling and leaves little pieces behind in my hair. Piece of junk!</li>
    <li> Nice brush. Sent quickly.</li>
    <li> THis is a great product My Fiance recommended I give it a try and the Boar bristles have little teeth at the end of each bristle that pulls the natural oils at the base of your hair to the tip of your hair and makes your hair feel naturally smooth. Would recommend for anyone male or female.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!! I have curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t pull it out!</li>
