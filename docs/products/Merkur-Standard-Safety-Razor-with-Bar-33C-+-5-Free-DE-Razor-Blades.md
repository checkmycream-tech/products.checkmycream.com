<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Handle is to short for me and not comfortable but the razor does shave great.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift. The quality of construction seems good, and it has a nice heft to it. For me, the handle is too short on this model. I felt as though I could only hold it with a thumb and two fingers and I never felt as though I had a lot of control with this razor. I have large hands so maybe you could get by if you have small hands. I sent this one back and I&#x27;m considering either the longer handled version of this model, or one by Parker, with a head that butterflies open, which seems like it would make cleaning the blade easier.</li>
    <li> I use to shave with a regular Gillette multi blade razor (mach III)  but I have sensitive skin and in growing hairs. In saw a video on YouTube regarding safety razors and how gentile they are to the skin so I decided to try them. Initially I purchased a Parker razor (the quality is good to start) and then I decided to buy a Merkur because of the comments about it. I do not regret of the decision I made and honestly everything it is being said about safety razor is true, my skin is better, not irritated, no more  in growing hairs. Of course you need to buy also safety razor blades, a shaving brush (I recommend a pure badger bristle brush after trying a few) and a shaving soap or cream and I recommend to watch the videos in Youtube to learn how to shave with a safety razor, how to build decent lather, etc, just type \\&quot;safety razor\\&quot; and videos from mantic59 will appear, best to learn about it. Also search for [...] reviews it will help you a lot to decide.</li>
    <li> This razor can be a challenge to use.  The single blade can be hard to position to cut the hair properly.  Without the pivoting head that disposable or cartridge razors have, it forces the user to evaluate each movement of the razor while shaving.    But it is a gratifying experience to shave with a timeless tool for hair removal.</li>
    <li> I have gone from using a Mach 3 in high school/college, to a fancy electric Bruan self cleaning shaver for a few years, and most recently a double edge safety razor, and the DE safety razor is hands down the way to go.  I purchased the Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury shave set which included a badger fur brush and mug/soap cake and I am also very happy with that stuff.    Pros:  - You get an awesome shave.  And I mean really awesome.  - You feel like a badass while you are shaving/lathering up.  You&#x27;ll never go back to using goo out of a can.  - You save tons of money on blades    Cons:  - It takes a little bit longer to shave.  That&#x27;s the only con.  After you shave with a DE for a few weeks, you&#x27;ll get better and it will take less and less time.</li>
    <li> I am sick of these prices for the disposable razors. I ordered this razor and it arrived in 3 days. The shave is incredible. It took me a couple times to remember how to shave with the old style razor, but man this is as good as it gets. I want to shave 2-3 times a day to feel the closeness of this razor. This is a qaulity razor that I would recommend to anyone. It will cost you $20+ dollars to just get a refill on these new 4 blade jobs. Enjoy and pamper your self with a great clean shave that will thrill your senses.</li>
    <li> Not a bad razor but there are so many other better razors out there in this price range. My goal is generally to have the sharpest blade possible in a non-aggressive razor. That combination works best for me. An example would be a Feather in an EJ DE89 or Lord L6. Also, the quality of the razor isn&#x27;t really that good either. Acceptable and useful but not outstanding.</li>
    <li> Excellent first double edge razor to start out with.&lt;br /&gt;I switched to a double edge out of cost and was SURPRISED at the closeness of the shave I get from it, granted you do not Rush shaving.&lt;br /&gt;It is economical, traditional and by Far gave me the closest shave I have ever had, wish I had gotten one years ago.&lt;br /&gt; bought one for my 20 year old son as well, hope he will do the same for his son, multi-blade razors cannot compare.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Merkur!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic razor.  I have tried a number of them, but this has to be the best I have tried.  It is easy to hold due to the textured grip.  Well worth it&#x27;s price, and your time.</li>
    <li> This is in fact a great razor.  My husband was so very pleased with it and the joy-if there is joy-in shaving has returned.  He fells the weight is right and the razor is well made.  Easy to keep clean and fits the hand well for a close and clean shave.</li>
    <li> When I was 16 about 20 years ago, Gillette sent me their latest and greatest 2 blade razor as a gift and I&#x27;ve been using some variation of their product ever since.  I got tired of buying replacement heads and have considered a DE safety razor for some time.  I finally took the plunge and cannot believe how much better the safety razor is than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before.  There is no competition, especially when using traditional shaving soap and a badger hair brush!  The first time I used it I wondered if I was doing it wrong because I could not feel anything.  It felt like I was using the razor without a blade yet my face came out baby smooth.  It was a eureka moment for me.  I feel as though I&#x27;ve been duped all these years by the diposable razor industry.  I will never use anything other than my safety razor from now on.  If you&#x27;ve been considering a DE safety razor, buy one.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> My job requires me to be clean shaven so I have to shave even though I have very sensitive skin and a thick beard. I have been looking for a razor that does not irritate my skin for years. After buying all sorts of modern razors and electric razors, I have finally found something that works well without irritation. I really like the weight of this razor but would prefer a longer handle. There was 5 small pack of blades included and a single Merkur blade. Blades on DE razors vary by manufacture and the user should try out a variety of blade brands/types to find what works best. I bought a sample pack like [[ASIN:B001QXXIHM Double Edge Razor Blade Best Sellers Sample Pack #5 - 30 Blades]] to figure out what worked best for me.</li>
    <li> I love this razor, Shaving with  A DE razor for the 1st time does has a bit of a learning curve.  Once you find the technique that works for your face, Ahh its a dream.  As for the 5 free DE razors that come with it. DONT BE FOOLED  they are not Merker blades.  The seller does not make any mention that they might be. SO with that at hand.  The blades i received shave well, and are not as aggressive as the Merkur ones.  THis is a good thing  it may allow you to find and hone your technique till you get new Merkur  or other brand blades.</li>
    <li> Many years ago when I first started shaving, cartridge type razors were just starting to enter the market, so I had the opportunity to use each early on.  I ended up using the cartridge type because of their convenience, but after about 5 years I went to an electric.  About 5 years ago I switched back to a bladed razor and settled on the Mach 3.  I was interested in a DE razor for my travel kit and not finding any in the local stores, I went to Amazon.  After reading all the great reviews I thought, wow, maybe they have improved over the years, so I purchased the Merkur standard 33C and an assortment of blades and gave it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a half now and have reached the following conclusion.  If you work at it, you can get a reasonably close shave with it, but not a perfect one, even with a Feather blade.  You will need to go over your face a couple of times and it&#x27;s still not as close as a single pass with the Mach 3, and the more times you go over you face, the more apt you are to get razor burn.  I can get 3 to 4 shaves with the DE razor before I need to replace the blade (Feather blade), I can get 8 shaves with the Mach 3 before I need to replace the cartridge.  The difference in the quality of the shave of the DE razor does not change whether it&#x27;s used with canned lather or shaving soap and a brush, however the shave does improve if you shave after you shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old technology usually gives way to new technology for a reason, and it&#x27;s not always marketing.  Our grandfathers traded straight razors for DE razors because they were easer to use and maintain and gave more consistent results.  DE razors fell by the way in favor of the multi-blade razors for the same reason.  The reason you can&#x27;t find DE razors anymore in the local department or drug stores is because there is not much of a market for them, and that&#x27;s because people generally prefer the multi-blade to the DE, and this didn&#x27;t just happen over night.  It took time for consumers to distinguish the difference and settle on the multi-blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some people who will use this DE razor and be completely satisfied with it, and I think that&#x27;s great, it&#x27;s certainly less expensive to use, but if you&#x27;re like me and you just want to lather up and shave one time in the morning with no remaining stubble, or razor burn, stick with the multi-blade system.  It&#x27;s top dog in the razor market for a reason.  The Merkur is going in the travel kit, where I expected to put it from the start.</li>
    <li> I used to shave with straight razors all the time. Then life caught up, had kids and couldn&#x27;t be bothered with the ritual that straights demanded. Tried electrics for a couple years and hated them. For the past 4 years, I&#x27;ve been using disposables. 3 blade, 4 blade, 2 blade. Didn&#x27;t matter, they all suck, and they&#x27;re ungodly expensive. My wife was buying a 4 blade brand that was $18 for 8 replacements. That&#x27;s over $2 per shave for me - I refuse to use disposables more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After putting pen to paper, I realized that it was time to get back to my \\&quot;roots\\&quot;. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have any quality straights anymore and a replacement is over $300. So, I figured I would try another classic razor and picked up the Merkur 33C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Surprised\\&quot; would be an understatement. \\&quot;Thrilled\\&quot; is a little closer, but still can&#x27;t convey how happy I am with this razor. So far I have tried Feather blades, the Merkur that came with it and Wilkinson Swords from Wal-Mart. They all perform better than any multi-bladed contraption out there. I would even venture to say the shave from the Merkur with Feathers is as good as the shaves I used to get from my best straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to be careful of when starting out: pressure. If you use the same heavy pressure as need with cheap disposables, you will get razor burn. You only need very light pressure to get the smoothest shave of your life. Also, another point for this razor, you will not get hairs stuck between blades and then stabbed with those same hairs. There is a rather large area behind the blade for the lather and hair to go. Occasional rinsing is all that&#x27;s needed. No more whacking the handle on the sink to get the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a really enjoyable experience, be sure to use a good soap and badger hair brush. Some brands that come to mind that are top notch: Taylor of Bond Street, Trumper, Proraso, and on the inexpensive end, Col. Conk. Lately, I&#x27;ve been using Cremo Cream. It&#x27;s nice, but very finicky about the amount of water. So far, the best combination for me is Col. Conk Bay Rum soap, a nice big mug and badger hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002JKSP38 Col. Conk Bay Rum Glycerine Shave Soap]] - love this soap&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001XURHAW Colonel Conk Progress Model 1001 Standard Pure Badger Shaving Brush, Black Handle]] - this is the same brush I use. It&#x27;s not fancy, but it works&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001RXSEZC Cremo Cream The Astonishingly Superior Shave Cream 177ml/6oz]] - Cremo Cream has a nice smell and feels great, but is very touchy about the amount of water required.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0013RZ2ZM \\&quot;Derby Extra\\&quot; Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades]] - You can get 100 blades for less than $9, and they have great reviews. Awaiting mine, I&#x27;ll update this after I get a chance to shave with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Almost a year later and I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to a multi-blade disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cremo Creme is still sitting on my shelf. It&#x27;s too difficult to get the water to Creme mix 100% correct. Too much water, and it drips off your face, too little and it&#x27;s like Elmer&#x27;s glue.  The shaving cream I&#x27;m using now is (don&#x27;t laugh) \\&quot;Coochy Cream\\&quot; by PureRomance [[ASIN:B0039GAX0E Coochy Rash Free Extra Gentle Shaving Cream. Pearberry. Large 8 Oz. Unisex]]. If you can get the Green Tea, it&#x27;s actually very nice smelling. The original scent smells like baby powder, but it&#x27;s a very light smell. Of course you can combat this with a good aftershave: [[ASIN:B000EVIVYW GABELS Bay Rum After Shave Lotion 16oz/1pt]]  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derby blades didn&#x27;t pan out. They tended to drag across my face and cause a lot of irritation. Feathers are the best blades I&#x27;ve found to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: March 2013 - I broke my Merkur this morning.  Twisted the handle too tight and snapped the threaded piece off that attaches it to the head of the razor.  Looking at my order invoice, I owned this one razor about 31 months.  For those trying to figure the costs involved, that&#x27;s about $1.31 per month for the Merkur. Just figure out how many times a month you shave and you can get the per shave cost of the Merkur.  Long story short, I&#x27;m buying another Merkur (and some more Feather blades...ran out of those too this morning).</li>
    <li> Very nice razor, especially for the price!  The best feature is the checkered/rough handle.  Great grip when your hands are wet.</li>
    <li> Bought as a starter replacement for overpriced cassette razors.  Very well made, handles nicely, and once I got the hang of it after a few uses - shave very close.  Quite happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> This razor is excellent, as I expected from a Merkur product. This is my first safety&lt;br /&gt;razor that I have used and it gave me a closer shave than my Schick Hydro 5 in only one pass! I am absolutely in love with this razor, I highly recommend it to anybody looking into starting traditional shaving.</li>
    <li> well constructed and very high quality. I like the heft of it and how it fits in my hand. I only wonder how the long handle ones work</li>
    <li> Excellent razor. I&#x27;m allergic to nickel a this razor is perfect for me. Be very very careful using it. It&#x27;s not like the cheap throw away razors. You do not need to press down on it or you will cut yourself bad. I&#x27;ve never has such a close shave before.</li>
    <li> I was tired of spending so much money for disposables so I invested in this little thing and I have already got my money back on it. Using this takes a little practice and you have to shave a little slower at first but it is worth it. I shave in the shower with no mirror and use a shaving soap( which is cheaper and better than shaving cream in the long run) and get a good clean shave. It has a ridge on it that helps guide you around your upper lip area. I have cut myself but I was in a hurry that time. It is worth it. dont spend a lot of money one one of these things. No need. This Merkur is great for starting out with a safety razor. I have nothing to say about the blades cause I havent used them all up yet to try others. Like I said, this is cheap and easy.</li>
    <li> This is a very well made CLOSED comb razor. Closed comb meaning that it keeps the blade a bit back from your skin so it&#x27;s less likely you&#x27;ll cut yourself. I think this makes it a good first double-edged razor. The handle is shorter than some others but I find it fits my hand well and offers me good control as I shave. The heft feels good in my hand. Some blades have marks or numbers to help you distinguish which side of the blade your using...but some don&#x27;t. My only suggestion would be that a small Mark be engraved on the razor&#x27;s head to do the same function. I find I get best results by taking shorter strokes and rinsing the blade often. I&#x27;ve even begun to use this razor to shave my head with great results. My razor included five Bic blades. I wasn&#x27;t impressed with them. I suggest buying a sampler pack and experiment with various brands. I did and so far I&#x27;m leaning toward the Shark stainless steel. Without a doubt, shaving this way is WAY more economical than disposable razors and an Earth- friendly, green thing to do too.</li>
    <li> Threw my mach 3 out the window when I shaved with this. Be sure to use water shaving techniques with this razor. Hot water to open up the pores, shaving cream and start the shaving experience of your life ^_^</li>
    <li> This was my first safety razor, and I was impressed by the sturdy and precise construction. I was surprised at how short the handle is; it looked tiny when I unwrapped it. I have fairly small hands, so it hasn&#x27;t been a problem, but those with larger paws may want to consider another model.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected but great</li>
    <li> I was using those 3 and 4 blade razors for years. I just got sick of spending $15 bucks on the replacement blades every month or so. I decided to try this one out because it seemed very durable. I have been using it for over a year and have spent maybe $7 on 100 replacement razors. I am not even 1/2 way through those. And somehow this one blade, old standard gives me a closer shave than any of those 4-5 blade options.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure whether to buy this model or the Merkur version with the wider, heavier handle. In the end, price was the determining factor. Shaving with this razor is much less complex than I thought it would be. I pretty much shave like I did before with my Mach 3, only I go a little bit slower. After having used this razor for a while, I think a heavier, wider handle would maybe give it a little bit better balance and make it easier to hold. The head on this razor is very heavy, and the handle is shorter than you might think. So, it&#x27;s a little bit of a trade off if you don&#x27;t want to spend the extra money. Bottom line: this version is cheaper, and it works fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this &#x27;entry level&#x27; DE razor after I&#x27;d purchased and used quite a few other higher cost DE razors.  Boy!  This is a great razor.  I actually like using this razor every bit as much as more expensive razors and it give&#x27;s a great shave easily equal to much more expensive razors.  This is quality!  I agree with a poster in a different forum that say&#x27;s that DE shaving is about 20% equipment and 80% technique.  Well, here&#x27;s your 20%.  A little spray of Scrubbing Bubbles after each use will keep off the soap scum and keep the razor looking beautiful!  This and the Edwin Jagger 89 series are both terrific razors.  You won&#x27;t go wrong here!</li>
    <li> I have been using this with a Conair shaving cream warmer, rinsing my razor in cold water, and I&#x27;ve had great results. The cold water keeps the razor blade from expanding/contracting and keeps the edge sharp so it will last longer. It&#x27;s such a relief not to be bound to buying those cartridges and never remembering which razors I had at home and which blades fit them. This will save you money, and the razor works better than the cartridge razors. Better for the environment, also.</li>
    <li> Got this along with the cheap brush/soap/dish kit. Just tried it out, I must say with a little bit of practice in regard to the chin area, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to cartridges. This razor has a really nice weight to it, feels good in the hand (though if you have large hands you may want to look elsewhere). Included blades (big ben) left me smooth, can&#x27;t wait to try out some others so I get the perfect fit for my face.</li>
    <li> I will never buy another cartridge razor!  I have been shaving with it for about two weeks and I love it.  The blades are 1000 times cheaper and the shave you get is better for your skin.  For 30$ or so what do you have to lose, it would cost you that for the fusion blades.  Try it, but go slow when you first start out or you will cut or nick yourself.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve found this page, you&#x27;re one of a select few that have decided to stop buying into the marketing gimmicks and ploys and start shaving better and spending less.  A while ago, I stumbled upon this blog post: ([...]).  I had been feeling frustrated with my shaving habits.  That article was my salvation!  Something about my face, my heritage, necessitates excess care.  I&#x27;m not one of those guys that can just shave once a week and be done.  I can never shave without showering or putting a hot washcloth over my face to open my pores.  Even that has to be mixed in with pre-shave gels and some benzol peroxide to make sure everything goes right.    This razor was the beginning of a new age.  The blades you use are cheaper than shaving cartridges and last longer, so my shaving bill was drastically reduced.  Instead of pulling three, four, or five crappy blades over my body, I was artfully maneuvering one slick blade.  At first I stuck with my normal shaving cream, but eventually I got a badger hair brush and foaming cream and I felt even better.  The brush and cream didn&#x27;t really increase my shaving time and it definitely made me feel more manly.    I still have to prep my face beforehand, but now everything just feels... right.    PROS:   - the safety razor itself is made very well and will last you close to a lifetime   - german engineering!   - double-edged razor blades are very cheap compared to cartridges and last longer   - you get a much better shave   - the new shaving gels and accessories like the badger hair brush are totally worth it   - you feel really good.    CONS:   - not the easiest thing to learn, could hurt yourself the first few times (so I recommend getting a styptic pen: http://www.amazon.com/s/field-keywords&#x3D;styptic%20pen any will do)   - you definitely get some stares if you shave at your gym or other semi-public location    I&#x27;ve been doing this for a while now and bought this product as a travel razor.  One this to remember is this isn&#x27;t TSA safe, so don&#x27;t keep it in your carry on - or at least make sure the razor blades are in your checked bags!  If you forget your razors or they get stolen, you can always pick up some at a local barber or use Amazon!</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever used.</li>
    <li> WOW, that&#x27;s all I can say.  This is my first one ever, combined with simple Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, a double shave took just a little longer than with standard cartridges, but lasts a lot longer and feels great.  No tugging on stubble, or burning sensation.  I had to watch a video on youtube on how to use the brush and soap to make the lather, and that&#x27;s it.  Highly recommend, great knowledge to pass on to others.</li>
    <li> Everything is great about this razor except for its handle length. If you have larger than normal hands then this razor will feel puny to you. But for its price you can probably deal with it like I did.</li>
    <li> I should have switched to this razor YEARS AGO.  A much better shave than with your typical cartridge blades, and SO much less expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Merkur 33C for a year or so.  It&#x27;s a very pretty razor with relatively heavy chrome plating.  The handle is essentially a clone of a Gillette Single Ring (ca. 1910 or so), so the name \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; really is appropriate.  The grip is excellent, with deep diamond-shaped knurling. Balance is good.  The balance point is right at the top of the knurled section.  For me, that&#x27;s where my forefinger sits on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial shaves with this razor, though, were just not very close.  I&#x27;d been DE shaving for a while, and had what I thought was decent technique.  I just wasn&#x27;t impressed with the shave.  I got closer shaves with my Gillette Slim.  So, the Merkur 33C went into the drawer of dead razors where it sat for a good long while.  Then, last month, I pulled it out, loaded a [[ASIN:B0077LAJT2 Personna Double Edge Razor Blade]] and went to town.  Eureka!  That time in the drawer had taught the Merkur a lesson.  :-)  My technique must have improved and I had mastered the 33C.  It&#x27;s now among my favorite DEs (I have a couple dozen).  On a long business trip recently, for which I was only packing one DE and one SE, I threw the 33C in my Dopp kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving the razor 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note: This is NOT an open comb razor as the description claims.  It&#x27;s got a safety bar.</li>
    <li> Really happy with this purchase. When Dollar Shave Club erupted in popularity, there was a lot of discussion on the cheapest way to stay shaved. This is my choice. It&#x27;s classic, easy, attractive, and the blades are extremely affordable. I recommend supplies from The Art of Shaving to accompany the razor, and a styptic pencil helps too.</li>
    <li> This was my first real shaver, was a bit worried at first but this has always given me a great shave. A bit heavy for those used to the disposables, but this thing never clogs for me. It was a great gift for my father on Fathers Day . Thinking of getting a straight razor now, apparently my shaving is going back through time.</li>
    <li> The razor I received looks different than the one in the picture but it is still an amazing razor, it&#x27;s very heavy(solid) and hasn&#x27;t rusted or chipped at all. What else can I say? It does its job and does it well. I would recommend this razor for anyone who wants to try shaving the a DE razor</li>
    <li> should have read the other reviews. If I&#x27;d known there&#x27;s one with a longer handle, I probably would&#x27;ve gotten that. Other than that, no problems.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about trying shaving with a safety razor, but I&#x27;ve found it easier than I thought. This razor is well made and I can&#x27;t see how it won&#x27;t last forever! I have noticed it does develop a thin film on it -from the moisture-. and I&#x27;m not sure how to avoid that, if anyone else has any suggestions I&#x27;d love to hear them</li>
    <li> It took a while to get used to shaving with a safety razor, but once I got the hang of it, I got a closer shave with less irritation than using cartridge razors.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this razor from Amazon but figured i&#x27;d write a review to try and help someone with a decision. I decided to try safety razors after growing tired of paying for disposable razor cartridges that always gave me razor burn. I tried all the popular 5 bladed razors on down to the single bladed disposable razors and got the same results, close shave with skin irritation. After reading on an internet forum about wet shaving i thought i&#x27;d give safety razors a try. It took a few shave to get the proper angle and pressure but after finding the sweet spot i got the best shave of my life with no irritation. I prefer the 33c over open comb razors as i find them to be less aggressive (some may disagree but this is my opinion) the 33c has been my go to razor for about 6 years now and have tried numerous other safety razors but love this one the most. I also use straights but when i&#x27;m pressed for time i use my Merkur. If your looking to try wet shaving this is a nice beginner razor and it&#x27;s also nice for the veteran shaver. I tried an HD but found it to be a little to heavy and had trouble getting an irritation free shave (inexperience is the cause of this) the learning curve for the 33c was easier. I also liked the Merkur blades as they were easier to learn with. The more experienced may suggest sharper blades such as Feather but i found mistakes with such sharp blades gave me irritation. Now i use Feathers as my experience level has increased and i can get an irritation free shave with them. Wet shaving is a fun way to shave and needs to be brought back. It&#x27;s also addictive so be ready to buy all kinds of soaps, razors, brushes etc lol it&#x27;s a fun addiction though. Good luck and enjoy!</li>
    <li> No more ingrown hairs, cheap to use. Stop buying disposable junk razors that kill your face. Great gifts!! I have bought 4 of these.</li>
    <li> After years of wasting my money on disposable razors, I finally gave up and decided to go old school with a single edge.&lt;br /&gt;The weight feels good, not too light not too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Blade was incredibly sharp. Cut myself the first time out. I hate it when that happens. The cut wasn&#x27;t too bad. Got the bleeding stopped. The really annoying part was how my underwear irritated the cut all day.&lt;br /&gt;I give the razor 5 stars. A good buy, has a good feel and best of all works.</li>
    <li> greatest, closest shave and super cheap to shave. arrived on time and in nice packaging</li>
    <li> As a novice, I was able to get one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.  I can only begin to imagine the types if shaves ill achieve after mastery</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the shave. Every time you clean the blade during a shave you have to remove the entire top of the razor.</li>
    <li> I make homemade bath and body soap, wet-shave bars and etc.  My husband has always been an electric shaver kind of guy.  But I needed a guinea pig for my soaps so purchased this for him as &amp;#34;a present&amp;#34;.  Having used a similar razor in his US Navy days, he was willing to give it a try.  Not only is this razor extremely well-made but IT.IS.SHARP!!  The razor dictates the speed at which you should shave and it isn&#x27;t fast unless you want to lose some skin. It is a bit of a pleasurable ritual for hubby to shave in this fashion but the result is incomparable.  Its close, no razor bumps (like he used to get from the disposables) - his skin is smooth for so much longer.  Would recommend purchase of this item - my only complaint is the ad read &amp;#34;5 Free DE Razor Blades&amp;#34;. We received exactly one free blade - I had seen that mentioned in more than one review so be sure to order blades when ordering this item.  Amazon was kind enough to refund the amount for purchase of additional blades I had already ordered.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because it came with the 5 extra blades. I was curious if a safety razor would in fact be better than a standard fusion razor. I am happy to report that it is indeed much better and more comfortable. There is also a psychological effect, you feel really classy using this and it makes shaving an enjoyable experience. The blades are very sharp and high quality. Best thing has to be how easy it is clean, no amount of beard hair is going to get stuck.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with the 5 DE blades.  The product is fine otherwise.  Not sure what happened, but those blades were not included.</li>
    <li> I had never used this sort of safety razor before, so when I first started using it I cut myself up a lot. It turns out that you *must* shave *with* the hair and not against it at first. After that first shave, you can remove all the stubble going against the hair if you desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you learn to use it well, it&#x27;s an amazing razor. Replacement blades are pretty cheap (especially in bulk) and tend to stay sharp for at least a few shaves each. This is compared to disposables from Costco, which would only work the first time and thereafter pull on the hair and without cutting it.</li>
    <li> This is s great safety razor. Great finish looks amazing really. Couldn&#x27;t wait to show it off. Works great the razor angle is perfect not to aggresive. Now I did find it a little short in overall length. But with time it fits nicely into my hand with my pinky resting on the bottom. The weight of the razor is enough to do the job for you. If your looking for a DE razor and you have big mitt I would suggest a Merkur 23c. Shipping was fast surprised me it arrived to early. Thanks for the quick and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I switched back to a good old razor after several years of electrics and will never go back.  I love taking the time and feeling so much smoother.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for a little over a year now and I have no complaints. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to in comfort and with style, and has more than paid for itself in the number of shaves I&#x27;ve gotten from it already with no sign of wearing even in the slightest yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of going into detail about the whole wetshaving thing, I can just say that this is about a medium on the aggressiveness scale, and it&#x27;s safer than another razor i own. It performs amazingly with Astra blades and gives me about 4 good shaves a blade before changing them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides: The merkur blade that comes with it is crap. Although it doesn&#x27;t hurt when it cuts you, even a brand new merkur blade results in a bloodbath. Mine also came with 5 extra Lord blades (made in Egypt) which were also quite bad, and I know that it&#x27;s a luck of the draw thing on what blades you get from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this razor isn&#x27;t a maximum quality product that you would expect from the germans. It&#x27;s made from a cheap zinc alloy which is brittle. If you happen to drop it, it will crack and it can&#x27;t be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better razors out there, but if you&#x27;re just looking for something cheap, functional and effective, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. It&#x27;s still my razor of choice even though it has stable mates.</li>
