### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest...</li>
      <li>It a great product!!!</li>
      <li>i love this deity of america or deity of hair shampoo and conditioner!!!!!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t regrow hair but works great for health of hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>However, I bought the plant shampoo and plant conditioner and thought the conditioner was nothing great.  </li>
      <li>please save your money and buy another shampoo that has good reviews</li>
      <li>It works and we love the herbal scent!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I have been using this product along with the shampoo, conditioner and scalp treatment since October 2014 and it has been amazing.</li>
      <li>In addition to this, I have used the leave-in moisturizer which is excellent, leaves hair very silky.</li>
      <li>It is effective in that way.</li>
      <li>The most amazing thing about this product is it controls the oil on my scalp.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, medium-long length wavy hair.</li>
      <li>it helped to make my hair grow plus made it more manageable and healthy in appearances...</li>
      <li>I love the conditioner too.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even use conditioner most days.  </li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s sulfate free!    </li>
      <li>I do not believe this helps your hair grow but it does volumize your hair and give it the illusion that you have more hair then you do.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ok with the planty smell because of the results.</li>
      <li>It cost a bit more, but you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>, so far, so good.</li>
      <li>i have the big size and wish they would make more big size like 32oz&#x27;s would be great!!!</li>
      <li>This deity of hair shampoo and conditioner is super fantastic...</li>
      <li>but I like how the shampoo leaves my hair feeling silky and clean.</li>
      <li>Since my hair loss is temporary, I dont know how this product rates with \\&quot;full blown\\</li>
      <li>Natural herbal ingredients are much better than using cheap grocery store products on your hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very gentle shampoo that does not strip hair of oil and make it squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>After my third child, I found a free-sample of this product and fell in LOVE!  </li>
      <li>After the first shampooing and conditioning my hair stopped breaking and has been growing ever since.</li>
      <li>aside from the horrid smell, it left my hair extra greasy and more and more hair falls out after each wash.</li>
      <li>The smell detered me from using regularly.... :)</li>
      <li>It has a distinct smell of fresh cut grass, not unpleasant but different.</li>
      <li>I have been using it once a week for 3 weeks now and my hair feels more healthier than it has in a long time.</li>
      <li>I have fine and thinning Asian hair was concerned about all the hair I&#x27;d lose after showering.  </li>
      <li>Very woodsy smell.  </li>
      <li>I spend so much money getting everything for nothing</li>
      <li>Hair looks very shiny.</li>
      <li>My hair was originally brittle and constantly breaking.</li>
      <li>This is the second bottle that I bought to have when I run out of the first bottle.</li>
      <li>I tried deity of hair shampoo for the first time last night.  </li>
      <li>we have stressors that make our hair fall out and were young to</li>
      <li>This product I will give it credit for keeping the hair soft and manageable,  however the product claims it reduces dandruff</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a gentle shampoo that doesn&#x27;t break your hair and helps you keep the hair you currently have.  </li>
      <li>When I used my normal conditioner with the plant shampoo, I had the same results and my hair smelled like my conditioner, not the plant shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I bought this from my local beauty supply store for $13 and used up the whole bottle in about 3 months with daily shampooing.  </li>
      <li>It left my hair very soft with lots of body.</li>
      <li>It is more expensive than I would usually spend for shampoo but this shampoo left my hair feeling much thicker and full, with no product build-up.  </li>
      <li>My hair is much healthier, a little thicker, and definitely longer after using this shampoo.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m actually trying out the Black Hair formula now to see if there&#x27;s a difference, but this is definitely a repurchase product for me.</li>
<li> it actually promotes dandruff and makes the hair extremely itchy even when you wash it thoroughly, the smell is strange, the hair growth was not delivered</li>

<li> its foreign  I like foreign stuff  </li>

<li> I am black with relaxed hair.  </li>
<li> Less hair falls out but not substantially less.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo with the conditioner for a few months after seeing a recommendation on the Birchbox.com blog (see link to blog below).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This did not do what it promised but I like how the shampoo leaves my hair feeling silky and clean.</li>
    <li> this shampoo did nothing for me! please save your money and buy another shampoo that has good reviews and you know it works because this shampoo doesnt work.</li>
    <li> Smells like dirt, but no smell after rinsing; my friends swear by it.</li>
    <li> This deity of hair shampoo and conditioner is super fantastic...it helped to make my hair grow plus made it more manageable and healthy in appearances...i have the big size and wish they would make more big size like 32oz&#x27;s would be great!!! i love this deity of america or deity of hair shampoo and conditioner!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product along with the shampoo, conditioner and scalp treatment since October 2014 and it has been amazing. Recently, I added the tonic hair growth restorer, which I use on my temples and nape area. My hair was originally brittle and constantly breaking. After the first shampooing and conditioning my hair stopped breaking and has been growing ever since. I have become a walking advertisement for these products.</li>
    <li> I have been having hair shedding for the past year and a half, lots of it.  I have tried numerous products which does not help.  I tried deity of hair shampoo for the first time last night.  It left my hair very soft with lots of body. Two strands of hair came out when I brushed it this morning, so far, so good. I am black with relaxed hair.  I will keep everyone posted on my results week by week.  In addition to this, I have used the leave-in moisturizer which is excellent, leaves hair very silky.</li>
    <li> I am prone to having excessive hair loss after pregnancy. (around the temples, on the hairline)  About 6-9 months after I deliver, my hair starts growing back....  After my third child, I found a free-sample of this product and fell in LOVE!  It is more expensive than I would usually spend for shampoo but this shampoo left my hair feeling much thicker and full, with no product build-up.  I have used thickening shampoo&#x27;s before and they left me hair frizzy.  The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest... it&#x27;s an earthy/minty smell.  However, I bought the plant shampoo and plant conditioner and thought the conditioner was nothing great.  When I used my normal conditioner with the plant shampoo, I had the same results and my hair smelled like my conditioner, not the plant shampoo.  Since my hair loss is temporary, I dont know how this product rates with \\&quot;full blown\\&quot; hair loss.  I would totally recommend this product (shampoo, not conditioner)!  I am a white female with dark blonde/light brown hair that IS color-treated.  :)</li>
    <li> I have very fine, medium-long length wavy hair. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo with the conditioner for a few months after seeing a recommendation on the Birchbox.com blog (see link to blog below). Smells a little weird in the shower but no smell at all once my hair is dry. Only helps a little with hair loss in the shower, but it does add volume.

My hair is much healthier, a little thicker, and definitely longer after using this shampoo. Plus it&#x27;s sulfate free!    [...]</li>
    <li> Been using over a year. Hair looks very shiny. No residue on scalp. Less hair falls out but not substantially less. Doesn&#x27;t regrow hair but works great for health of hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> its foreign  I like foreign stuff  me and my brother want to make this our brand we have stressors that make our hair fall out and were young to</li>
    <li> I love this product! My hair has been getting healthier with each use. I love the conditioner too. They work well together. If you are a \\&quot;Wen\\&quot; user and want something that is gentle and repairing for less, these products are for you!!!</li>
    <li> I like the smell and tingle of this shampoo, it seems to be helping the thickness and feel of my hair. Natural herbal ingredients are much better than using cheap grocery store products on your hair. It cost a bit more, but you get what you pay for. I&#x27;ll keep using it, because I do believe it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> I do not believe this helps your hair grow but it does volumize your hair and give it the illusion that you have more hair then you do.  It is effective in that way.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair feel fuller. I&#x27;m ok with the planty smell because of the results. Would DEFINATELY recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using it once a week for 3 weeks now and my hair feels more healthier than it has in a long time. This is the second bottle that I bought to have when I run out of the first bottle.</li>
    <li> This product broke my hair off really bad! My hair began to split in 3 place per hair strand. I also noticed that it makes your hair very dry. I purchased the entire line of products and instead of my hair growing I had to get about 3 inches of my hair cut. I have tried to contact the maker but to no avail.</li>
    <li> I was growing blad in front my hair in a small area.  And saw the gease at cvs, l gave a chance and l can&#x27;t believe it start growing my hair in like a couple of days..  That&#x27;s when l decide to use the shampoo too...  It a great product!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this from my local beauty supply store for $13 and used up the whole bottle in about 3 months with daily shampooing.  I have fine and thinning Asian hair was concerned about all the hair I&#x27;d lose after showering.  I can&#x27;t speak for the claims to \\&quot;Accelerate Hair Growth\\&quot;, but I did notice much less hair in my shower drain from day one.   It&#x27;s a very gentle shampoo that does not strip hair of oil and make it squeaky clean.  It still cleanses my scalp without leaving my hair dry, nor does it weigh it down.  I don&#x27;t even use conditioner most days.  If you&#x27;re looking for a cure-all or Rogaine, this isn&#x27;t it.  It&#x27;s just a gentle shampoo that doesn&#x27;t break your hair and helps you keep the hair you currently have.  I&#x27;m actually trying out the Black Hair formula now to see if there&#x27;s a difference, but this is definitely a repurchase product for me.</li>
    <li> Save your money , this stinks it dont work .. I spend so much money getting everything for nothing No difference</li>
    <li> This product I will give it credit for keeping the hair soft and manageable,  however the product claims it reduces dandruff it does the opposite it actually promotes dandruff and makes the hair extremely itchy even when you wash it thoroughly, the smell is strange, the hair growth was not delivered as well I paid about 14 bucks with tax for a small bottle and was highly disappointed</li>
    <li> After using the products for some months now, I believe them to be bogus, especially the Hair Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner makes my hair hard and unmanageable and I have noticeable hair shedding after use.&lt;br /&gt;The product is phony.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> It works and we love the herbal scent!</li>
    <li> Very woodsy smell.  Didnt notice that it did anything for hair growth.  The smell detered me from using regularly.... :)</li>
    <li> Aside from the odor of vegetation it seems to be working with continued use.  It has a distinct smell of fresh cut grass, not unpleasant but different.</li>
    <li> i hate this line of products! my hair falls out more after using it than before :( i used the shampoo, conditioner, and pre-was product. aside from the horrid smell, it left my hair extra greasy and more and more hair falls out after each wash. i&#x27;m running to nexxus&#x27; emergencee</li>
