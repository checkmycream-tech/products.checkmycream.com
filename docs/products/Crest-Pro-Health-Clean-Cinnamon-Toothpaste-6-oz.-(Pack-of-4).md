      <li>My wife and I enjoy this toothpaste because it works and it is cinnamon flavored.</li>
      <li>To my knowledge, this Crest product is no longer available in retail stores.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used another Crest cinnamon toothpaste that tasted great, but this is entirely different.  </li>

      <li>We have used the Clean Cinnamon Pro Health for years....</li>
      <li>This toothpaste tasted great, but I&#x27;m giving it 1 star because one of the ingredients gave me dry, peeling lips.</li>
      <li>While it does clean your teeth.</li>
      <li>If you can find Clean Cinnamon, buy it.</li>
      <li>Why don&#x27;t the stores in Oklahoma carry Clean Cinnamon?  </li>
      <li>The Clean Cinnamon is not a gel and thats why we like it.  </li>
      <li>My wife is very picky with toothpaste, this one isnt my favorite, but she loves it.</li>
      <li>Not a bad price for a four pack.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A very tasteful tooth paste.  Almost wants to make you brush 10 times a day.  If I still had young ones I&#x27;m sure I could get them to brush their teeth without a fuss.</li>
    <li> mmmmmmmmm cinnamon!!! It&#x27;s not hot hot hot like a red hot candy or fireball whiskey... but it&#x27;s definitely cinnamon flavored and leaves my teeth and mouth feeling clean. No sensitivity with this toothpaste! And it&#x27;s easy on my throat and tongue unlike some of the mint flavors. These tubes have the wide flip top lid so you can stand the tube up on a shelf in the medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m nuts about this toothpaste. It tastes so good, feels so fresh, and has just the right texture. I ordered it online so I&#x27;d have a stock of it if they ever stop making it!</li>
    <li> since it&#x27;s toothpaste, I don&#x27;t know what else to say. They arrived on-time and in tact. I bought via the subscribe program because I could save money and don&#x27;t have to go the grocery store after work.</li>
    <li> cinnamon is hard to get in some locations... love it</li>
    <li> Only toothpaste I will use!</li>
    <li> Well I think many toothpastes are good for you and always getting better so why this one stands out if it tastes amazing! It is a bit pricey at almost $5 for small tube but I can&#x27;t find locally very often so I&#x27;m buying in bulk here on amazon.</li>
    <li> We have used the Clean Cinnamon Pro Health for years....for some reason, the stores in our area don&#x27;t carry this flavor any longer.  They only carry the gel stuff which we don&#x27;t care for.  The Clean Cinnamon is not a gel and thats why we like it.  We have to buy this online in order to get it.  Frankly, I don&#x27;t get it.  Why don&#x27;t the stores in Oklahoma carry Clean Cinnamon?  They did several years ago, now nothing but gel.  In any case, the wife and I like this so much, we buy it online in quantity so we don&#x27;t run out.  You really must like a toothpaste to go to the trouble of buying it in bulk online, huh?</li>
    <li> It has all the ingredients to make teeth and gums healthy.  The taste is just refreshing.  My kids love it too.  I trust Crest ProHealth so much, that I have decided to order several packages of it.  Nothing much else to add.</li>
    <li> EASY PURCHASES GOOD PRODUCTS</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like the taste of mint, cinnamon is the way to go.  Sometimes it is hard to find in the store, finding a 4pack and having it delivered the next day was a bonus.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Great deal with Prime shipping!!</li>
    <li> As a family, we like this. The cinnamon feels a bit gritty and makes it feel like you are really polishing your teeth. Refreshing taste and my mouth feels cleaner longer.  Also, thicker than our last paste so it doesn&#x27;t flow out on to the countertop if someone leaves the lid off (which is everyone).</li>
    <li> Should of listened to the one in the pack of lemmings that warned of this..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bummed as I was hoping to have my toothpaste buying handled..lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This tastes like crap..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End of story..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onward with my search!</li>
    <li> LOVE this toothpaste; my stomach likes cinnamon much better than mint!</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste for me. I have not had any cavities or other oral hygiene problems for several years. I do get my 6 month checkup and cleaning regularly and that helps too! Not bad for a 64 year old lady!</li>
    <li> The only ADA approved non mint flavor I can find.  Love it!</li>
    <li> delicious toothpaste. oddly liquidy though.</li>
    <li> I really wanted the gel cinnamon crest. I didn&#x27;t realize they made it in a paste. My mistake and the toothpaste is OK.</li>
    <li> I would not but this product again. While it does clean your teeth. It does not taste good at all.  Makes me want to rush through the process -- and that is not the point of brushing your teeth.</li>
    <li> We love this toothpaste and it is hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I have used this toothpaste for quite awhile. It uses Stannous fluoride instead of Potassium Nitrate as the anti-sensitivity ingredient! It works and I love the flavor (cinnamon) and the light gritty texture. Craig S.</li>
    <li> This Crest Pro Health cinnamon flavor is not easily found in stores. I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries it. If you dislike mint flavor, but still need a refreshing taste in your mouth when you brush your teeth, this toothpaste may be good for you. In addition, I was a Colgate Total customer for years, until my orthodontist recommended this one. WHAT a blessing! It cleans better, reduces tar build up and help with yellow teeth or some yellowing of your teeth. Please understand that my teeth (like 4-5 of them) were slightly yellow and not completely. If your teeth are completely yellow, I don&#x27;t know if this will fully work for you. I can tell that my teeth are whiter and people can too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Crest. Clean Cinnamon is not too sweet or tart - it&#x27;s just right. We can&#x27;t find this flavor in our local stores.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothpaste. It has a great cinnamon flavor, whitner, tarter control and sensitivity feature. Also a great price.</li>
    <li> Toothpaste with all the attributes I need and I love the Cinnamon taste which is very difficult to find in the local stores.</li>
    <li> Mint flavored toothpaste makes my husband sick.  We have to go on Amazon to find cinnamon Crest Prohealth--thank heavens!  Great product and taste.  As usual, it comes really fast when I order on Amazon.</li>
    <li> One of the only cinnamon flavored toothpaste still around. Leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> My favorite taste, have been ordering this one for years. I do not like minty pastes, this one is a rare treat. Not overflavoured as other cinnamon brands like cinnamon blast, this one also has a nice texture.</li>
    <li> Been using the TP for 5 years and love how it cleans and the taste is good too.  It is hard to find so I am glad Amazon has this product.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used - it&#x27;s &amp;#34;grittier&amp;#34; than the mint version, which manages to give my teeth a &amp;#34;just been to the dentist&amp;#34; &amp;#34;sand-blasted&amp;#34; super-clean feel all year round.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for cinnamon toothpaste, this is a great one. Tastes good, not too strong/burning like some of the natural brands of cinnamon toothpaste, and my teeth feel clean. No complaints here. I will order again.</li>
    <li> This is the only place I can get the toothpaste I want</li>
    <li> Hard to find this flavor. Only can find &amp;#34;Mint&amp;#34; the blue one which colors my gums. If you can find Clean Cinnamon, buy it. I have great checkups and my Dentist even tells me that.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste, and I started getting pretty nervous when it was disappearing off shelves at the local grocery stores. I was elated to find it on Amazon and bought a bunch (fearing that it was being discontinued).  Since then, I set up a subscription since it&#x27;s the only toothpaste that I use. Some may not like the texture, which is a little gritty rather than being a gel or straight paste.  The grittiness does not bother me at all.  Cubes of gum have a similar gritty type of quality.  I like the flavor and vastly prefer this Crest to another which is a cinnamon gel with cinnamon sticks shown on the front of the packaging.  If you&#x27;re buying this toothpaste online, you&#x27;re probably already a fan.  If not, I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love the cinnamon flavor!</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste we use. I was so happy to find it on Amazon and for a really good price, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
    <li> Not that anyone should use a toothpaste only for its flavor, but this one is exceptional.  The cinnamon flavor is mild and pleasant enough to make brushing a little more tolerable.  I have no complaints and recommend it for people who can be a bit touchy about flavored dental products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found this product difficult to find in stores.</li>
    <li> For some reason most brick and mortar stores have stopped stocking the clean cinnamon.  I am so glad that amazon sells this product because I dislike most of the &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; toothpaste.  Crest pro health leaves your teeth feeling clean and fresh breath - just what a toothpaste should do.  I hope that amazon will continue to carry this in the future!</li>
    <li> Love the cinnamon flavor.</li>
    <li> For some reason, I can&#x27;t find this toothpaste where I live in South Florida. I hate minty toothpaste, so for me, this is my preferred brand. Shipped fast, and my teeth are happy again. (They were growing green fuzz.)</li>
    <li> I love the taste and the results.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is that I don&#x27;t like the consistency of the paste.  I despise messy toothpaste tubes (usually attributable to the user with conventional tubes) but these are difficult to keep neat.  If the tubes are stood up on the cap as intended, the toothpaste will ooze down onto the closed cap.  When opened, the toothpaste is strung out between the inside of the cap, the top of the tube, and the applicator.  This is avoidable if the tube is laid down or propped to stand &amp;#34;upside down&amp;#34; but that defeats the purpose of the convenient, &amp;#34;stand-able&amp;#34; tube.&lt;br /&gt;Other flavors we&#x27;ve used are manageable (with a little effort) but this one seems to be slightly worse.  I&#x27;ve noticed that Crest representatives or vendors have responded to other comments so I felt this may be a good way to voice my minor but hopefully correctable concern.  I&#x27;ll continue to use the product as-is but will switch if a neater version comes along.</li>
    <li> My dentist turned me on to this, it reminds me of the polishing compound he uses, complete with those groovy abrasives. Problem is, in a small town of limited choices, this disappeared from all shelves some time ago. Like retailers always say, &amp;#34;No, but we can order it for you...&amp;#34; I am so sure. Thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
    <li> Favorite product - easy to purchase</li>
    <li> One of my boys hates mint and I have a hard time finding the cinammon Crest in stores near us, so picking up a 4-pack on Amazon was a no-brainer. Happy kids, teeth brushed, happy mom.</li>
    <li> The cinnamon is a bit strong but it does do the job.</li>
    <li> Great price on an item I&#x27;ve been using for years. My kids love the taste. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, excellent price!</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste! Perfectly cleans, freshens the mouth, pleasant to the taste! My family is happy!</li>
    <li> I love this Clean Cinnamon Pro-Health toothpaste from Crest (The toothpaste itself is what I rate 5 stars).  I would give Amazon 1 star for their pricing of it, though.  I can only get it online, probably because it is not the most popular with many people.  Anyway, the price has been steadily rising on Amazon (as have the prices on almost all of their goods), and of note the prices of Amazon-fulfilled, Prime-eligible options are INFLATED!  This toothpaste has inflated to $5.24 per 6oz tube. Ridiculous!  It is currently available on the Proctor and Gamble eStore for $4.00 per 6oz tube, and they offer free shipping if you buy more than $25 worth of goods (which is 7 tubes).  This price beats the best available price on Amazon by $1.24 per tube for Amazon Prime members!</li>
    <li> I cant stand the normal mint flavors. It just stains my mouth for hours. This clean cinnamon offers a very mild taste that does not linger in my mouth past 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> My wife and I enjoy this toothpaste because it works and it is cinnamon flavored. I get tired of mint flavored toothpastes.</li>
    <li> My wife is very picky with toothpaste, this one isnt my favorite, but she loves it. she complains it&#x27;s hard not to just eat it cause it&#x27;s so good (weirdo). our local target carried it once, we tried it, then went back for a refill and they had stopped carrying it for some reason. so really glad we were able to find it online, and might have been even cheaper than at store, can&#x27;t verify that though.</li>
    <li> I looked in stores locally for this, but I could only find mint. I hate mint. This toothpaste works great, and my dentist gives me kudos at my check ups when I use this. Love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like mint so this is so much better, it makes me want to brush more.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this taste and it cleans my teeth well. Not a bad price for a four pack. I am a big fan of cinnamon this is a paste not the gel stuff the gel leaves a funny after taste for awhile this does not it leaves my mouth feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> Great Toothpaste - wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> A decent taste after getting used to it.  The Pro-Health toothpastes are my favorite ones.</li>
    <li> I love it but not much cinnamon taste!</li>
    <li> great taste-great buy and good for ur teeth</li>
    <li> This toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling so clean and fresh.  I love the cinnamon flavor - it&#x27;s one of the only ones.</li>
    <li> For some reason here where I live you cannot get cinnamon products at all. I would of liked to see a two pack shipping.</li>
    <li> Timely and convenient!</li>
    <li> Great tasting toothpaste although a little runny</li>
    <li> nice taste but caused skin in mouth to come off</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore!  This is just what the doctor ordered for anyone who&#x27;s not a fan of mint toothpaste.  I&#x27;m not sure I could go back to mint after getting used to this--I hope Crest continues to make it.</li>
    <li> Like brushing your teeth but hate the taste of regular toothpaste, then this is the stuff for you. Enough said.</li>
    <li> Does a good job, tastes fine.</li>
    <li> I like cinnamon more than mint. Can&#x27;t get it almost anywhere locally.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste and I&#x27;m so glad it is available on subscribe and save! It is impossible to find a cinnamon paste in most stores, although you can find a cinnamon gel, it&#x27;s just not the same. The flavor of this is not too powerful, not too sweet. My entire family has been converted to this flavor and it is the only one anyone wants to use anymore (I originally purchased it just for me and kept buying the normal mint flavor for everyone else). It&#x27;s a great choice, I just wish it were more widely available.</li>
    <li> Works as promised. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Not much to say, it is Crest toothpaste and I prefer cinnamon to mint.</li>
    <li> Happen to like this flavor, used to be in stores all over then one day Gone.&lt;br /&gt;As long as I can buy cases here I am Happy!</li>
    <li> my main issue was having such a dry mouth after I brush, and I  really like the cinnamon flavor instead of mint or other.</li>
    <li> If you prefer the cinnamon toothpaste and are looking for a toothpaste that does it all, this is it. It addresses sensitivity, cavities, whiteness, plaque, tarter,  and breath freshening all at once. The cinnamon taste is not as strong as the gel cinnamon toothpaste, unfortunately, but it does seem to do what it is advertised to do.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t have mint and I prefer this over the gel type.  It really gets my teeth clean.  My dentist was pleased that I have much less plaque than I did on my last visit.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in the stores where I live, so it&#x27;s good to find it somewhere. This is my favorite toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste I will use.  I just had my first visit to the dentist in 10 years and no cavities!</li>
    <li> I love the crisp cinnamon flavor! Very limited availability. Amazon was the only source that had this in stock. Even the P&amp;G store was out of stock. I have used the Pro Health for years with good results. This is the first time I have tried the cinnamon. I hope it will continue to be available.</li>
    <li> Cant find this flavor in the stores anymore. My favorite.</li>
    <li> Hate the mint gel! Love the paste</li>
    <li> From a flavor perspective, Cinnamon is my favorite of the Crest Pro-Health toothpastes.  Pro-Health is a multi-purpose toothpaste that appears to use a higher percentage of Stannous Fluoride rather than Triclosan.  I observe far less bleeding of the gums and my teeth have a more &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; feel after using this product.  Dental checkups (as in, no cavities) are always good, and while proper eating habits (not so much sugar) and more frequent brushing has alot to do with this, I think Pro-Health has been most beneficial to the health of my gums.  I was a frequent user of regular Crest in my younger days,  I&#x27;ve been steady on Pro-Health for at least 3 years now and will probably stay that way.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t have a cinnamon flavor.  I&#x27;ve used another Crest cinnamon toothpaste that tasted great, but this is entirely different.  There are so many toothpastes on the market, and I assume that most do a good job of cleaning, so I pick mine based on flavor.  I wouldn&#x27;t choose this product again.</li>
    <li> I love Crest Pro-Health Clean Cinnamon Toothpaste and am so disappointed that it is no longer sold in stores in my area. Will continue to buy online.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste tasted great, but I&#x27;m giving it 1 star because one of the ingredients gave me dry, peeling lips. I never thought this toothpaste was the cause, but it was the only thing I changed in my regimen. I found out through Google that Crest toothpaste could case this so I discontinued using it and sure enough my lips stopped peeling.</li>
    <li> Very good. Good texture, effective and very tasty. All purpose. I would go to a lot of trouble to secure this. I hope they continue to produce it.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  The taste is spicy and refreshing, the amount required is minimal, and the container stands on its own if you want.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ll use. I am not a fan of regular tasting mints toothpaste. The flavor stays with you. I have excellent check ups from my dentist.</li>
    <li> Above all others, this has been my favorite and primary toothpaste for years.  Cleans teeth and mouth well, leaves mouth feeling fresh with just a little bite of cinnamon after taste, tubes are &#x27;stand up&#x27; versions, and Crest&#x27;s Pro Health paste cinnamon tastes much much better than any cinnamon gel (or other pastes for that matter) I have purchased.  All other cinnamon toothpastes either don&#x27;t taste right or are overpowering.  To my knowledge, this Crest product is no longer available in retail stores.  A little more expensive than other brands but in my opinion it is worth it and convenient to buy in 4-packs.</li>
