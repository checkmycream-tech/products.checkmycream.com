### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Just awesome!</li>
      <li>It is wonderful to wash the dogs with.  </li>
      <li>She will lie perfectly still when I spray this on her and will remain tranquil even when I comb her...</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s incredibly bothered by flies and mosquitoes</li>
      <li>My daughter says it works great on her itchy mosquito bites, too.  </li>
      <li>The spray and shampoo/soap is great for pets and humans.  </li>
      <li>It works great as an all around insect repellant.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great for a lot of things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t care for the shampoo/soap for my hair, but great on my skin.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great product that I&#x27;ve used for years.  </li>
      <li>Because the Keys spray bottle product has worked liked freaking gangbusters on Lou!</li>
      <li>All Keys products are effective!</li>
      <li>Used on pets &amp; myself with good results.</li>
      <li>More people should know about this!</li>
      <li>Safe for pets and people!</li>
      <li>(my hair looked really nice after spraying that stuff in it every day)</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is good to keep a bottle around; because it has many uses and it is safe (and even nourishing) to things that aren&#x27;t insects.  </li>
      <li>I love that there are many uses for it and -- unlike most insect repellents -- it seems to actually be good for your skin.</li>
      <li>but I love it</li>
      <li>I just love it.  </li>
      <li>Glad I can get it here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;A couple of things, if you want to keep insects like flies away from your campsite or tent, you are better off spraying this  around the entrance of your tent</li>
      <li>I could find a SAFE product that works for 24 hours.</li>
      <li>Because of her age (23) and frailty, I am reluctant to use most flea products on her.</li>
      <li>This natural healing spray works great on insect bites and soothes scratches.</li>
      <li>and it really works!!!  </li>
      <li>I was originally given this as a gift.</li>
      <li>The list of ingredients is amazing, and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
      <li>Lou is in a great mood and feeling so much better, she&#x27;s running around and being playful with the other dogs even though she usually acts superior to them.</li>
      <li>Make sure you do it outside and leave them out for a bit.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless anti-itch sprays after making sure they weren&#x27;t harmful.  </li>
      <li>This has really helped my husband&#x27;s eczema!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Really, the high price is the only downside, but I can understand because there are some fairly exotic ingredients (neem oil, karanja oil, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Buying this was a pure desperation move.  </li>
      <li>There is no sting and it is very soothing.</li>
      <li>Considering I&#x27;ve been trying to help her for a month, this seems like a straight up miracle.</li>
      <li>Different, but not unpleasant scent.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Allergy season is a time to suffer for both me and my pet.&lt;br /&gt;While i wouldn&#x27;t spray this all over MY body, my little dog feels so much better after i spray it all over</li>
      <li>They smell VERY natural.</li>
      <li>He has very sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I can usually get through a flea season without pesticide topicals or pills by using this spray, Keys Medicare soap, and keeping her sleeping area very clean and washed.</li>
      <li>Like hippies run wild.</li>
      <li>I have been using it frequently.</li>
      <li>It worked stopping my dog from licking a lick sore, it healed completely.</li>
      <li>His skin is clear, his hair/coat soft.  </li>
      <li>Also bought the natural healing shampoo and soap to bath the dogs.  </li>
      <li>This spray is very soothing and healing to the skin whether canine or human.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first thing that has ever worked after I&#x27;ve spent 100&#x27;s of dollars on all the stuff the vet recommended, from sulfur baths, to medicated shampoos, to hypo-allergenic food, testing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff, alone, was not enough to get rid of them completely</li>
      <li>As a purchase, it is not cheap, but worth the price.</li>

<li> Would look for other Keys products in the future.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just not strong enough, and it&#x27;s not really worth spraying an entire expensive bottle of Redi-Care when the kitten is just gonna lick most of it off in a few hours, anyway.&lt;br</li>
<li> It works on contact, but only for a few hours for him.  </li>
<li> Just be careful you don&#x27;t get it in their eyes</li>
<li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
<li> it may work for other things and it may work for your dog, so dont go by what Im telling you.</li>
<li> Plus fleas and other insects do not like it</li>
<li> I like the story behind this product; created after Hurricane Katrina when the rescue workers and their animals developed skin infections from all the stagnating water.  </li>
<li> Sprayed it on my hands and rubbed them down with it and the fleas started jumping off.  </li>
<li> (it made them only grow to be very small, but they still hung in there).  </li>

<li> My poor little French Bulldog&#x27;s skin was erupting from allergies.</li>
<li> Though he did not enjoy the smell at all, the flies stayed off of both of us.</li>
<li> It obviously works very well as a flea repellent and as a balm for irritated skin on pets, as well as people.</li>
<li> I used it over the past weekend at an agility trial where there were tons of flies.</li>
<li> This made my dog worse.  </li>
<li> My elderly cat is terribly allergic to flea bites and her skin becomes very inflamed.</li>
<li> /&gt;First aid for wounds, soothing anti-itch cream, insect repellent, lotion, probably as a hair conditioner, anti-parasite (such as lice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I had a rash on my stomach that itched like crazy .I</li>
<li> She also no longer stinks.  </li>
<li> TOO BAD, HUSBAND!</li>
<li> time I got lice from some nasty hotel.  </li>

    <li> This has really helped my husband&#x27;s eczema!</li>
    <li> This natural healing spray works great on insect bites and soothes scratches. I will make this product a permanent item in my medicine cabinet.  I have been using it frequently.</li>
    <li> Different, but not unpleasant scent. Used on pets &amp; myself with good results. Would look for other Keys products in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dog. He&#x27;s incredibly bothered by flies and mosquitoes and we&#x27;re outside quite a bit in south Florida.  I used it over the past weekend at an agility trial where there were tons of flies. Though he did not enjoy the smell at all, the flies stayed off of both of us. I love that there are many uses for it and -- unlike most insect repellents -- it seems to actually be good for your skin.</li>
    <li> This made my dog worse.  He has very sensitive skin.  Cannot use.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great product that I&#x27;ve used for years.  Glad I can get it here on Amazon.  Expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my dog because a lady told me that it would stop the dogs Itching, but my dog did not like it and it didnt stop the itching. it may work for other things and it may work for your dog, so dont go by what Im telling you.</li>
    <li> My poor little French Bulldog&#x27;s skin was erupting from allergies. She looked like she had some sort of mange, ringworm, flea bite combo on her tummy and her skin was so itchy and patchy, that she&#x27;d flinch if you touched her. I googled ”patchy itchy dog” or something along those lines and Keys products came up. I buy everything on Amazon, so I searched here and bought 3 different Keys lotions and the soap. They smell VERY natural. Like hippies run wild. I like it - my husband does not. TOO BAD, HUSBAND! Because the Keys spray bottle product has worked liked freaking gangbusters on Lou! I&#x27;ve sprayed her patches every night for a week, and her skin is about 90% healed. Considering I&#x27;ve been trying to help her for a month, this seems like a straight up miracle. Lou is in a great mood and feeling so much better, she&#x27;s running around and being playful with the other dogs even though she usually acts superior to them.</li>
    <li> My dog has a skin allergy and will scratch himself almost to the bleeding point.  Keys Redicare Spray stopped his scratching and soothed his skin.  My dog gives it four paws up!</li>
    <li> I had a rash on my stomach that itched like crazy .I had a sample size of this spray in my medicine cabinet I grabbed it and sprayed it on, the itch instantly stopped! The rash turned out to be hives and this spray is a life saver!!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells like a spa!  Works like a dream!&lt;br /&gt;Allergy season is a time to suffer for both me and my pet.&lt;br /&gt;While i wouldn&#x27;t spray this all over MY body, my little dog feels so much better after i spray it all over his.&lt;br /&gt;Granted he&#x27;s not a fan of the smell, but frankly he doesn&#x27;t like the smell of any product.&lt;br /&gt;What he does like is not itching.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for a lot of things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First aid for wounds, soothing anti-itch cream, insect repellent, lotion, probably as a hair conditioner, anti-parasite (such as lice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things, if you want to keep insects like flies away from your campsite or tent, you are better off spraying this  around the entrance of your tent and/or spraying it over a tapestry and then hanging the tapestry nearby.  That way it will soak into the cloth, and the cloth will act as an insect repellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One time I got lice from some nasty hotel.  This stuff, alone, was not enough to get rid of them completely (it made them only grow to be very small, but they still hung in there).  This stuff coupled with a lice comb definitely did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similarly, I tried using it on my kitten to get rid of fleas.  It&#x27;s just not strong enough, and it&#x27;s not really worth spraying an entire expensive bottle of Redi-Care when the kitten is just gonna lick most of it off in a few hours, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the high price is the only downside, but I can understand because there are some fairly exotic ingredients (neem oil, karanja oil, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is good to keep a bottle around; because it has many uses and it is safe (and even nourishing) to things that aren&#x27;t insects.  (my hair looked really nice after spraying that stuff in it every day)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first thing that has ever worked after I&#x27;ve spent 100&#x27;s of dollars on all the stuff the vet recommended, from sulfur baths, to medicated shampoos, to hypo-allergenic food, testing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying this was a pure desperation move.  I use this on my Silky by backcombing her fur to get it on her skin and it really works!!!  She doesn&#x27;t care for the smell but I love it and she loves finally not itching.  She also no longer stinks.  My daughter says it works great on her itchy mosquito bites, too.  More people should know about this!</li>
    <li> It worked stopping my dog from licking a lick sore, it healed completely.</li>
    <li> I use this product every flea season.  I used to purchase the 8 oz container but I guess Keys Soap decided to offer it in a smaller size - 4 oz.  This spray is very soothing and healing to the skin whether canine or human.  Plus fleas and other insects do not like it so they stay away from the smell.  I can usually get through a flea season without pesticide topicals or pills by using this spray, Keys Medicare soap, and keeping her sleeping area very clean and washed.</li>
    <li> Purchased from a local organic store for $17.95.  Pet store also had it, but for $24.95.  My dog must have allergies as he itches all the time.  His skin is clear, his hair/coat soft.  No fleas.  I&#x27;ve tried countless anti-itch sprays after making sure they weren&#x27;t harmful.  I like the story behind this product; created after Hurricane Katrina when the rescue workers and their animals developed skin infections from all the stagnating water.  They discovered that it works just as well on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spay my dog daily with this; skipping a day if I give him an benadryl for relief (per vets instructions).  It works on contact, but only for a few hours for him.  I then use something else or re-spray.  I also buy the anti-itch shampoo (different brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could find a SAFE product that works for 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Worked wonders on my yokie.  It riddled him of fleas and skin irritation.  Safe for pets and people!</li>
    <li> Works well for our pooch. All Keys products are effective!</li>
    <li> I was originally given this as a gift. As a purchase, it is not cheap, but worth the price. I use it for cuts, abrasions, itchy skin, sun burn, etc. There is no sting and it is very soothing. My elderly cat is terribly allergic to flea bites and her skin becomes very inflamed. Because of her age (23) and frailty, I am reluctant to use most flea products on her. She hates being groomed yet this product seems to soothe her. She will lie perfectly still when I spray this on her and will remain tranquil even when I comb her... something she otherwise hates. It obviously works very well as a flea repellent and as a balm for irritated skin on pets, as well as people. The list of ingredients is amazing, and it&#x27;s all natural. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Bought this for three little chihuahua&#x27;s I was babysitting, (plus my 2 dogs and cat).  They had fleas and I was reluctant to put flea medicine on them.  Sprayed it on my hands and rubbed them down with it and the fleas started jumping off.  Make sure you do it outside and leave them out for a bit.  It works great as an all around insect repellant.  Also used it with a Q-tip for cleaning their ears (keeps away earmites).  Just be careful you don&#x27;t get it in their eyes and if you accidently do, please flush it with water.  I am almost out of this and will be ordering another bottle soon.  I just love it.  Also bought the natural healing shampoo and soap to bath the dogs.  The spray and shampoo/soap is great for pets and humans.  I didn&#x27;t care for the shampoo/soap for my hair, but great on my skin.  It is wonderful to wash the dogs with.  I just can&#x27;t say enough about these products.  Just awesome!</li>
