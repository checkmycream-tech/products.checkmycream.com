<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product.  It is easy to use and stays on.  I have sensitive skin and I use only this brand of deodorant. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My new obsession. The smell is amazing and long lasting. It kept me dry and smelling fresh all day! That says a lot since I work outside in 90+ degrees!</li>
    <li> Who says you can&#x27;t teach an old dog new tricks.  I was never a Secret girl.  But now, I am a believer.  I have been using it for the last 2 weeks and I do live in the south and the humidity some days is overwhelming, but Secret clear gel works.  It really works.  I do not sweat nor smell at all in the delicate under arm area. I am happy about that for sure.  I remember using another product and by the end of the day, I didn&#x27;t want to lift my arms up.  Now I have no fear.  And the best part about this Secret clear gel,  It doesn&#x27;t put white marks on the clothes and it doesn&#x27;t gunk up under your arms.  Amazing!!  I know we all have had that experience where you had your arms in the air and you see that deodorant all gunked up under there, balled up and looking gross.  Yea, I have been there also.  Not anymore!!!!!!  Love this!!  Thanks Secret for making a great product!!  I am also a bzzagent and I rec&#x27;d this product free.  But I still would have done a review without it.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant. Get it on subscribe and save so I never run out.</li>
    <li> Love this product and money saving 4 pack</li>
    <li> This does not smell like baby powder.  The odor is a clean smell but don&#x27;t buy this expecting to smell like baby powder.  The deodorant works well and there is no irritation.</li>
    <li> I make most of my purchases online these days and it&#x27;s nice to see I can also purchase my favorite deoderant. I&#x27;ve used Secret for years and it&#x27;s still very effective.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. It leaves no white residue and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Great buy.  This is only one of many good buys that I have made.</li>
    <li> My favorite for years.  Hard to find.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like the scent of vanilla? I use vanilla everything when I can find it, and I&#x27;ve used this one for years. Keeps me feeling fresh and clean all day.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave a white streak and works great.</li>
    <li> Fresh all day&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smoothly&lt;br /&gt;Great canister that works well&lt;br /&gt;clear - leaves no marks on anything.&lt;br /&gt;Have used every day for 3 years without ever a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I usually use the clear powder but I guess I made a mistake. .. hard to get the gel going. Had to turn the deodorant upside down and hit the bottom several times before the gel appeared and when it did I didn&#x27;t like the smell! ! Tried to give away as many as possible.</li>
    <li> I got an opportunity to try this product recently and I must say I&#x27;m impressed. I tried Secret products in the past but not this particular brand. I love that it leave no whites mark or residue. It also smells great also. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great underarm product.</li>
    <li> great product in general and nice fresh soft scent that doesn&#x27;t really have one, so great for guys and gals.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant ever! Works like a champ. Goes on dry and no white marks on clothes or me. Keeps the pits of shirts free from build-up that is almost impossible to wash out. Hooked for life!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but I don&#x27;t like the powder smell as much as the others that they have to offer. I smell it when I run.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a wet kind of deodorant that drys. it&#x27;s clear so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it on your clothing but it&#x27;s cold and weird.... Not sure how I feel about this.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain about anything it was all to my liking i must say when it come&#x27;s to Amazon Prime it set the mode right for everything to fall in line and for that i am thankful for &amp;#34;Amazon Prime&amp;#34; thank you &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34;keep up the Good Stuff</li>
    <li> It smells nice, goes on easy, is effective, and kind to sensitive skin.  I have nothing else to say.............really...........nothing.......I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> I have problems finding this in stores so ordering this in quantity is the ideal solution.  A good product at a decent price.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and it serves it&#x27;s purpose</li>
    <li> Awesome! Smells so fresh and after a long hot hard day when you don&#x27;t even feel fresh you still smell fresh! I&#x27;ll be continuing to purchase for sure.</li>
    <li> Works better for me than most. Long lasting during work day. Tried natural brands and I would be stinkie after an hour. Gel is better for me than solid.</li>
    <li> When I received the free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel, I was really excited. While I knew the Secret Brand, I was looking forward to trying a new scent, Completely Clean, since I&#x27;ve usually used Powder Fresh. I was also excited to try the clear gel, as I usually use the invisible solid. When I opened the cover to the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel, I was pleasant surprised by the fresh scent of the gel. It kinda smelled like you just got out of the shower...who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like that?!! I sure do!! To be honest, I was a bit speculative about the clear gel. The gel was cold when I applied it, and I was not used to the feeling of gel at first. However, within a matter of moments, the gel had dried and it was like I hadn&#x27;t applied anything at all to my underarm, which is exactly what you want. I received this product in retuen for my honest unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a 20 -minute jog around the neighborhood, I still smelled nice - the deodorant was still working! The only thing I didn&#x27;t really like was when I first began to perspire, my underarms felt a bit sticky, which i think is typical of gels. However, the sticky feeling went away in a few minutes and was not noticeable.</li>
    <li> Great price. Great product</li>
    <li> My husband and I both have used Secret for nearly 10 years, but, the solid powder fresh variety. People say \\&quot;if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it\\&quot;, but here in Savannah Ga, the heat and humidity gets worse every year and I decided to try this new Secret. We both love it and it keeps us dry, even on the hottest,muggiest day!!s</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this product.  It feels sticky and wet.</li>
    <li> Will order the dry next time.</li>
    <li> Lasts long, doesn&#x27;t stain. I&#x27;m having a hard time coming up with 16 more words to describe how much I like deodorant.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this and i just love it to bits. it is a very good product to try out</li>
    <li> I have been using Secret Gel for years and the Powder scent is really amazing and clean smelling. This product is tried and true and I will keep using it for as long as they keep making it. This is a great value.</li>
    <li> Great deodorant, It keep you dry all day and smells nice too without any overbearing scent. Secret is the only deodorant used in our home.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical because I have never used a non solid product.  But wanted to try this because there are no solid products that can say &amp;#34;free of white marks&amp;#34; because they aren&#x27;t!  This product is great!  Secret gel dries quickly and provided long lasting odor control.  I have enjoyed using it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of using a gel; however, it dried quickly and actually felt good going on.  I like the light scent and it lasts all day.  It says that it lasts for 48 hours.  I can not vouch for that as I will not go that long without a shower and reapplying. I like the water based formula and best of all no white marks on my clothing.  I received the product as part of a promotion from Secret</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and I am a guy.....&lt;br /&gt;Little to no smell but works great on me.&lt;br /&gt;Girlfriend always steals it though.</li>
    <li> This product has a great scent and does not sting after shaving.  When dry it does not leave any marks on clothing. Will purchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> i recieved this secret clear gel outshine free from bzzagent.  i am a big secret fan.  i only use secret.  so i was excited to get secret for free.  the first time i tried it i was going to church.  worked great.  the next time i tryed it out was at the gym.  now i have man size sweat.  after going to the gym i usualy smell like a football player.  which is always awesome being a girl and all.  but after using this clear gel outshine.  there was no smell.  bonus!!!!!  my new go to!</li>
    <li> I like the gel.  Love the fragrance and like buying it through Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save, as it is a bit pricey around here and not always easy to find.</li>
    <li> This really is clear, easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant!</li>
    <li> The ad for Secret used to be &amp;#34;Strong enough for a man, made for a woman&amp;#34;.  Well, the men in my house use this too, as it is such a great and strong antiperspirant and deodorant.  I buy it with the subscription program and save a great deal over Target and Vons (Safeway) prices.  It comes four in a pack, and we all enjoy it.  There&#x27;s no overly feminine smell to it, so my manly men don&#x27;t mind.  They like it better than the gel deodorants that Schick and the others put out.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, used it when I lived in the USA and found it to never fail. Always keeps you smelling fresh.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy.  Very convenient waqy to purchase.  Came within a good time.  I love gel deodorant.  Easy to find unliike stores.  Would recommend to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Noo white marks on dark dresses anymore..Love it for what it does to my skin..</li>
    <li> I have been using Mi-chum for years this works so much better and I feel so fresh</li>
    <li> I use this brand and type exclusively since I found it several years ago.  This is an affordable pack, as well, compared to some stores.  I had terrible sweating problems, even in the cold winters, and even used prescriptions to no avail.  Around the time I switched to this, my problem went away.  I can&#x27;t say for sure that it was this deodorant or a coincidence - but I never stopped using it and years later I never had this problem again.  This scent is really pleasant, but the other scents in this line I think are overpowering and teenager-ish. I am really happy with this purchase and am very loyal to this product!  I briefly tried the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; version of this brand, and it did not work as well as this one.</li>
    <li> Have used Secret products for decades.  Each variety works just as advertised or better, without fail.  There is no other personal product that I use that has engendered as much brand loyalty for me... low key advertising, does what it says it does.  Deserves raves and customer loyalty.</li>
    <li> Very light smell.  Great to use if you also use perfume or other scents, but don&#x27;t want to get armpit stains on your clothes.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this deodorant-the reviews seemed great.  Since summer is coming I wanted something clear, so that I could wear dark colored tank tops and not have white marks showing.  Well this is not the deodorant for that.  It also doesn&#x27;t dry fast like the package says.  I put on 2 clicks and it takes forever to feel dry, I even stand in front of a fan.  Once it feels dry I go about my business and within a few minutes it&#x27;s rolling into little white clumps in my armpit. So 2 clicks is too much? I&#x27;ve tried 1 click and it doesn&#x27;t seem like enough. It does not dry clear either- I still had white marks on my black tank top and the deodorant was dry by the time I put it on.  For sweating I guess it works, but I don&#x27;t see a big difference compared to other Secret deodorants.  I do like the smell (clean powder), but I will be cancelling my subscribe and save on this product.  I guess my quest to find a truly clear deodorant will have to continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: So I still don&#x27;t think this stuff dries fast or is clear BUT I must say it does work as a good deodorant.  I&#x27;ve been using it more then my other sticks of secret because at the end of the day, I don&#x27;t smell a trace of sweat under my arms.  With other sticks of Secret- including their clinical strength, I smell a little sweaty after working a long day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Secret during my teenager days in the States, and I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;m able to purchase again here on amazon. 100% reliable. Has a subtle fresh scent of clean. The gel format makes it so easy to apply - it just glides on and dries up in seconds. Only criticism (and hence 4 stars) is that my arm pits feel somehow &#x27;coated&#x27; after use, even when I use a tiny amount...and that you do get white marks on black clothes even with a transparent gel like this. As good as any deo can get, I guess!</li>
    <li> This deodorant really does go on clear, which is wonderful. Yet somehow it still manages to leave marks on clothing! It wears off about halfway through the day (as does most deodorant). The smell is very light and unable to be noticed shortly after putting it on, which is a positive.</li>
    <li> This item is a bargain when purchased online and always fresh.</li>
    <li> I received this in the free to try and review and I really like this Secret Outlast deodorant. I went out dancing for a friends 50th birthday party and wore a black dress. To my surprise it did not leave any &#x27;White&#x27; marks on my dress and kept me dry throughout the night of dancing. I liked the fact it dried quickly so I didn&#x27;t have that sticky feeling. I felt Secret Outlast lives up to its name, I have tried other clear gel deodorants and didn&#x27;t like that wet sticky feeling which the Secret Outlast didn&#x27;t. The next morning it was still working and I know this since I left the hotel without taking a shower till I got home! #GotItFree #buzzagent</li>
    <li> I like the scent and feel of this deodorant a lot and how easy it is to deal with. No messes or streaks! The only thing I have to criticize about it is sometimes I feel like I have to use a lot of it, like 3 or 4 clicks minimum. It does a good job though and I will continue to use it.</li>
