      <li>Love this product.</li>

      <li>, I Love the product but the seller needs to improve on shipping in a timely manner.</li>
      <li>That being said, I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love the Shea Moisture products -- all but this one.  </li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;m in the minority here, but I love the sandy texture.</li>
      <li>It worked better than the steroid creams that his doctor prescribed.  </li>
      <li>This product is top of the line.  </li>
      <li>I really love the Shea Moisture shampoos, which I use myself, so when I saw this I decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>Has many uses.</li>
      <li>use on grandaughter love it</li>
      <li>It was ok.  </li>
      <li>I am not too pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff</li>
      <li>it has a musk like smell that fades with time on the skin, I love the smell.</li>
      <li>I love this.  </li>
      <li>I so love the smell of this---</li>
      <li>I prefer the Shea Moisture lotion because it absorbs better and is easier to apply.</li>
      <li>It smells better than anything else I have ever sniffed EVER.</li>
      <li>Has no fragrance, which I love, and very rich with emollliants.  </li>
      <li>but once it warms up it becomes so smooth and easy to spread around.</li>
      <li>This product is super!</li>
      <li>has made a huge difference.&lt;br</li>
      <li>then smooth it all over your baby&#x27;s rash.</li>
      <li>Warm it gently between fingers or palms then apply.</li>
      <li>My skin has never been softer, I don&#x27;t even have to put it on every day for my skin to feel silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I had to heat it up and stir well to get a smooth texture</li>
      <li>Nothing special.  </li>
      <li>His skin seems so much smoother and better moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I love the way this smells, and it works really well too.</li>
      <li>but I love this so much I use it as a moisturizer for after his baths.</li>
      <li>My baby has sensitive dry skin and this lotion is perfect.</li>
      <li>Started to use it myself on my pregnant belly.</li>
      <li>Mild.</li>
      <li>I used to purchase this at Target but the two stores that are closest to us (2hours each way) haven&#x27;t had it in stock so definitely worth the time and money to purchase off Amazon.</li>
      <li>it is grainy, and greasy, but worth it.</li>
      <li>I tried many natural products for eczema, including Aveeno Eczema lotion, California Baby Eczema lotion, essential oils (tamanu, lavander, rose hip), and coconut oil.</li>
      <li>We use this products daily, it has a nice scent.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t stop the itching right away, but it smells lovely and is all natural.</li>
      <li>I use this right after his bath and then cover with a layer of Eucerin creme.</li>
      <li>my son has very large patches of excema on his arms and legs and after using this butter along with the soap (also made by shea moisture)</li>
      <li>My hands are quickly on the mend and actually are looking better.  </li>
      <li>Shea Moisture Baby Healing Lotion was my favorite, so I wanted to try this Eczema Therapy &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; because the lotion wasn&#x27;t enough to resolve eczema outbreaks, when the skin gets super itchy and starts cracking and bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve used special (and expensive) creams on him since he was a baby, but I&#x27;ve found this to be the absolute best!  </li>
      <li>His skin is perfect with a very rare rough patch (usually after swimming in a chlorinated pool).</li>
      <li>Her most recent flare up was GONE in one day.</li>
      <li>I purchased this at CVS for a higher price.</li>
      <li>this is the first review I have ever written.</li>
      <li>Actually made my Granddaughter itch more wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
      <li>I even put in on my legs after shaving and this helps moister them so much better than regular lotion.</li>
      <li>I need to order another one real soon!</li>
      <li>I actually went ahead and ordered two more, just so I can have one in the diaper bag and everyone can use it when they change her diaper (babysitter, relatives, etc).  </li>
      <li>I thought it would be smooth and easy to work with, but it&#x27;s like wet sand.  </li>
      <li>My new, adorable granddaughter was covered in eczema, face and body, and this cream got rid of it in only 2 days.</li>
      <li>The oils can separate and become grainy but I found that if you rub it between your hands for a few seconds before applying it to your baby it will melt and become smooth and easy to work with.</li>
      <li>It worked so fast</li>
      <li>I like to use on my feed at night smell is very relaxing.</li>
      <li>This shea butter mitxure really soothes and clears up my 2 and 6 year olds excema.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just for maintenance really at this point.</li>
      <li>If yours is grainy, try warming it up and stirring it back to a smooth consistency.</li>
      <li>The texture is smooth and creamy about the same as a tub of crisco</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very greasy putting on, so I try not to let him touch any furniture (or anything, for that matter)</li>
      <li>I put this on before bed every night and it really seems to help.</li>
      <li>I really like this for my son&#x27;s eczema prone skin.</li>
      <li>Very grainy.</li>
      <li>This lotion makes my babies skin so soft and she smells so good for a few days.</li>
      <li>I use this on my first child who is grain sensitive!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have extremely dry arms &amp; feet.  This is a God send!!!!  Has no fragrance, which I love, and very rich with emollliants.  It is rather greasy, so be careful if you use it on  your feet or hands that you wont hurt yourself walking or grabbing something.  But you can apply it and it wont come off like most creams.  And after awhile the greasiness is gone, but the moisture remains.  I love this.  Will buy it in bulk!!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this to give to my daughter for both kids have eczema.  However, I have to order her a new one.  I cannot part with this one!  Be patient with this butter.  It goes on gritty, but keep rubbing and it is like magic!  I have used on my dry cracked hand, feet and elbows.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Very grainy. Need to melt the oils in hands before applying. It is oily and time consuming to melt before applying. I like the ingredients it has though.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at CVS for a higher price. My new, adorable granddaughter was covered in eczema, face and body, and this cream got rid of it in only 2 days. Maybe it works well on different types of skin but it was truly amazing. I also gave it to a friend for their little boy, who only had a little bit of eczema, and it worked well for them too. TIP. These natural butters can get grainy because they don&#x27;t have preservatives and stabilizers. If yours is grainy, try warming it up and stirring it back to a smooth consistency. Or just rub it quickly between your palms for the same effect. It&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell much difference in baby&#x27;s eczema yet! :(</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product for anyone with eczema or dry skin used it on my daughter it cleared her eczema up and it smells good as well</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t moisturize enough, my son still has dry skin hours later even when it is really slathered and rubbed in. He is well hydrated. Other moisturizers have done a better job and went a longer way.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the only thing that has helped my baby with really dry skin patches all over. Need to &#x27;melt&#x27; it in your hand first as it is a real raw shea butter product that appears grainy, yet it all melts in your hand smoothly and then you rub it wherever baby&#x27;s got dry skin. Pleasant smell too. Great product, so glad I found this!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely obsessed this this product! I buy the soap, cream, lotion, and bath shower soap, and  oil. It smells better than anything else I have ever sniffed EVER.</li>
    <li> I use this on my first child who is grain sensitive! she cannot use anything else but this product for her eczema! I was super impressed and have since recommended to all friends and family, sadly this product is hard to find locally without having to drive far distances, so I order it online, it hasn&#x27;t showed up yet, I Love the product but the seller needs to improve on shipping in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing ever invented!  Thank you</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and feels really good to my skin and works well for my son…we both have eczema.</li>
    <li> This product is slightly different from the one I bought at the store. It smells good and works well though. Makes my skin soft.</li>
    <li> This lotion used to be better, but now it&#x27;s kinda lumpy and hard to rub in well</li>
    <li> I use this for my 5-year-old son who gets very dry skin very quickly.  We&#x27;ve used special (and expensive) creams on him since he was a baby, but I&#x27;ve found this to be the absolute best!  It smells nice too (I couldn&#x27;t say the same for the others).  It&#x27;s very greasy putting on, so I try not to let him touch any furniture (or anything, for that matter) until I have him completely dressed (and I only put it on his whole body before bed, but on his feet anytime).  The same goes for my hands while/after applying it.  The container finishes too quickly, but it&#x27;s worth replenishing for the great results!  His skin seems so much smoother and better moisturized.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> The consistency is thick and dense.  A little goes a long way. Warm it gently between fingers or palms then apply.</li>
    <li> Actually made my Granddaughter itch more wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Love it!! My baby has sensitive dry skin and this lotion is perfect.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to be grainy/chunky? Like spreading on crumbly lotion. I am not too pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I tried many natural products for eczema, including Aveeno Eczema lotion, California Baby Eczema lotion, essential oils (tamanu, lavander, rose hip), and coconut oil. Shea Moisture Baby Healing Lotion was my favorite, so I wanted to try this Eczema Therapy &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; because the lotion wasn&#x27;t enough to resolve eczema outbreaks, when the skin gets super itchy and starts cracking and bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shea Moisture Eczema Therapy came out of the jar dry and crumbly because of solidified oils. You have to massage it in with your fingers to melt it down. Besides this inconvenience, it also looks oily and shiny on my skin, which draws attention to my eczema. Worst of all, the product leaves my skin extremely dry and flaky. I prefer the Shea Moisture lotion because it absorbs better and is easier to apply.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a very sensitive with eczema prone skin, we went through other brands including Aveeno but this is it. It moisturizes her skin perfectly giving it a glow and zero rush. This cream is a go for her and we use it everyday. We love it!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my toddlers who get eczema when its dry. Works great. Started to use it myself on my pregnant belly. I actually prefer it over \\&quot;grown up\\&quot; and pregnancy lotions. Smells great and I love the heavy but absorbable texture.</li>
    <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product for my 2 years old son, so it works well for his eczema. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got it for my baby, her eczema isn&#x27;t bad but I love their other products so why not? It worked so fast, I had my 11yo daughter try it. She&#x27;s always had terrible eczema -- some products don&#x27;t irritate but nothing actually helps (some triggers can&#x27;t be avoided). Her most recent flare up was GONE in one day. Everyone with eczema should try this, not just babies!&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is grainy, and greasy, but worth it. Neither thing is as big a deal as you&#x27;re thinking it might be. Also, our pediatrician approves, in case you&#x27;re worried.</li>
    <li> Used this with the bar soap and it worked great. My babys eczema didn&#x27;t go away completely though until I got a script hydrocortisone cream. I then mixed this product with the hydrocortisone and it worked perfect. Now I am just using this cream and the bar soap it&#x27;s just for maintenance really at this point.</li>
    <li> I use this as my diaper rash cream on my baby. I have tried everything else, and in despair, I thought I&#x27;d go ahead and use this one instead because I already love Shea Moisture&#x27;s other products.  I love the smell of this one, and when I used this on my daughter&#x27;s bum, the nasty horrible blistery rash actually improved in 24 hours, so after at least 2 days of using it every diaper change, it helped to heal her rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never go with any other product. I actually went ahead and ordered two more, just so I can have one in the diaper bag and everyone can use it when they change her diaper (babysitter, relatives, etc).  You just have to scoop and rub the cream between your hands to make it liquid then smooth it all over your baby&#x27;s rash.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  The smell is wonderful.  It keeps my skin soft and moisturized.  I use it everyday to keep my skin from drying.</li>
    <li> This natural product worked wonders for my son&#x27;s eczema.  It worked better than the steroid creams that his doctor prescribed.  The pediatrician even commented on how dramatic the improvement in his skin was. I completely stopped the steroid creams and use this exclusively.  You wouldn&#x27;t know he has any skin problems now. His skin is perfect with a very rare rough patch (usually after swimming in a chlorinated pool).</li>
    <li> Helped clear up my infant daughters eczema on her back and arms.  Quite thick, use immediately after a bath while the skin is still warm to help it soak in and not very sticky.</li>
    <li> My 11 month old has had issues with eczema for about 6 months or so.  This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that actually works!  I only use natural products so I&#x27;ve tried coconut oil, ghee, homemade calendula cream, palm oil, etc. to no avail.  This cream stops the itching and helps healing.  I also highly recommend the Baby Eczema bar soap made by this company.  My son usually breaks out from soap (we use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s) but he has no reaction to this soap.</li>
    <li> I so love the smell of this---It works very well on my rough knees and I use it on my day care children.  The parents comment on their childs soft skin.</li>
    <li> This product is totally different from what I had. It&#x27;s got other ingredients in it that make it orange, grainy and greasy. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Was very disappointed that this product was not the same as I&#x27;d purchased at Target with the same packaging.  Hardly any aroma which was a very big reason why we liked the original product.  Great body balm and useable, just not what we expected</li>
    <li> My 10-month old has suffered from eczema all winter and we&#x27;ve tried many products -- J&amp;J&#x27;s, Aquaphor, BabyGanics, and others.  I really love the Shea Moisture shampoos, which I use myself, so when I saw this I decided to try it.  The container says the product is &amp;#34;non-greasy&amp;#34; but I found this to be exactly opposite the case.  If it has nut butters or similar moisturizing ingredients, it&#x27;s going to be greasy.  I didn&#x27;t have a problem with this so much as it made it really difficult to open and close the container -- it would be a lot better if this had a flip-top lid.  Also, the texture of the butter is grainy and falls apart.  I thought it would be smooth and easy to work with, but it&#x27;s like wet sand.  Maybe I got a bad container?  This was definitely not worth $10.  It did help soften her skin and provide some relief after just a day or two of use, but it was so hard to get on her skin I stopped using it.  Really disappointed!</li>
    <li> This product is super! It is the only thing that has worked on babes eczema. I used to purchase this at Target but the two stores that are closest to us (2hours each way) haven&#x27;t had it in stock so definitely worth the time and money to purchase off Amazon. I use this right after his bath and then cover with a layer of Eucerin creme.</li>
    <li> Like the texture and smell, just waiting to see if it helps with the baby&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> Will buy again, work&#x27;s so good on my grandson eczema. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells, and it works really well too. My 15-month-old girl gets eczema on her belly, especially during the winter months. She ends up scratching and scratching until she draws blood! I put this on before bed every night and it really seems to help. It is thick and buttery, but that&#x27;s kind of what you need to soothe the skin.</li>
    <li> It works great on my daughters skin. She has eczema and it&#x27;s help with moisturizing and soothing her skin. I love Shea Moisture.</li>
    <li> I sometimes get dry skin&lt;br /&gt;and it itches&lt;br /&gt;sometimes I have an area&lt;br /&gt;that my skin has flakes or redness&lt;br /&gt;this cream takes care of all that</li>
    <li> We use this products daily, it has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> Ok, I have been shopping on Amazon for a few years now and this is the first review I have ever written. That being said, I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I am an adult using this product, I had read about it on an app about beauty products and decided to try it as it has very few chemicals and good reviews. I have tried countless products and found the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; ones are particularly the worst. I have suffered from eczema my entire life, from early childhood and into adulthood and it has continued to worsen. Not one product I have tried worked for me, I would apply lotion numerous times a day with little to no results. Until I tried this! My skin has never been softer, I don&#x27;t even have to put it on every day for my skin to feel silky smooth. At first I was a little put off my how grainy it is but it just melts right in, and it smells wonderful. I use it on my hands and legs where my eczema is the worse and just using it for a week has made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;To all you eczema suffers, both children and adults, this is the product for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing, keep in mind when using this product is that a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This lotion makes my babies skin so soft and she smells so good for a few days. I always get ask if she is wearing perfume but nope it&#x27;s the lotion. I even put in on my legs after shaving and this helps moister them so much better than regular lotion. I got this product months ago and my daughter is now 8 months and we barely made a dent in this. So it will last a long time. It may seems hard to put on baby but once it warms up it becomes so smooth and easy to spread around. I love this stuff And I don&#x27;t have to put it on her every day</li>
    <li> This product is top of the line.  I have two grandsons with Eczema and I can confirm that this product cleared their skin 100%.</li>
    <li> my youngest niece uses this on her eczema. doesn&#x27;t stop the itching right away, but it smells lovely and is all natural.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. We bought it for my son who had eczema for a few months. It worked wonders and the smell is amazing. He outgrew his eczema but I love this so much I use it as a moisturizer for after his baths. The oils can separate and become grainy but I found that if you rub it between your hands for a few seconds before applying it to your baby it will melt and become smooth and easy to work with.</li>
    <li> I use this all over my body. Keeps  me all day long. And it smells awesome! I need to order another one real soon!</li>
    <li> This shea butter mitxure really soothes and clears up my 2 and 6 year olds excema. my son has very large patches of excema on his arms and legs and after using this butter along with the soap (also made by shea moisture) I notice his skin is much softer smoother and less itchy. I have been using this for over a month now and i have no complaints. The texture is smooth and creamy about the same as a tub of crisco maybe slightly thicker  it has a musk like smell that fades with time on the skin, I love the smell.</li>
    <li> It was ok.  Nothing special.  Didn&#x27;t help, didn&#x27;t make worse.</li>
    <li> Only thing is this was gritty. I had to heat it up and stir well to get a smooth texture</li>
    <li> I have severe dry winter skin and this has helped with the cracking and sores.  My hands are quickly on the mend and actually are looking better.  I use this at night while wearing cotton gloves.  It has helped my cuticles as well.</li>
    <li> I love the Shea Moisture products -- all but this one.  It&#x27;s too granular and they never break down into creamy shea butter.  Whatever the yellow is in this product stains.  I actually had to throw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> Mild. Has many uses. I like to use on my feed at night smell is very relaxing.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing! My daughter has had severe eczema since she was a baby (she&#x27;s 5 now). I have tried everything from oatmeal baths to wet wrap therapy, not to mention a long list of creams. This cleared up her eczema within a week. I guess I&#x27;m in the minority here, but I love the sandy texture. It melts as soon as it touches my daughter&#x27;s skin. She calls it her &#x27;sand therapy&#x27;. We both love this product!</li>
    <li> I really like this for my son&#x27;s eczema prone skin.</li>
    <li> use on grandaughter love it</li>
