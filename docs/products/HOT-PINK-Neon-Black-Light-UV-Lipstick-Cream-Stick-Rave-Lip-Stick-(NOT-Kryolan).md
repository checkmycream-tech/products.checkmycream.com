### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so I knew this product would be a perfect way to stand-out!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This lip stick was great for a bachelorette party!</li>
      <li>LOOKED SO GREAT!  </li>
      <li>Oily but looks great.</li>
      <li>AND IT WAS GREAT</li>
      <li>I bought it for a one time event and it was amazing!</li>
      <li>the color is bright.</li>
      <li>Even when I stood closer to the UV to see if it worked, it wasn&#x27;t as bright as I hoped.</li>
      <li>Was a gorgeous color on all of us.</li>
      <li>Whatever, it&#x27;s still good</li>
      <li>Loved it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>and I received so many compliments!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I assume this is a matte finish lipstick, which makes sense, but under UV light it looks horrendous lol.</li>
      <li>I kind of don&#x27;t like that.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually a nice color to wear even in daylight.  </li>
      <li>My wife loved this gift. :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I do like the lipstick lol its really cool and works under UV light.</li>
      <li>The color looks great during the day/in light, and it looks freak&#x27;n awesome under a black light!</li>
      <li>I love to go to clubs &amp; events with a bunch of LED lights</li>
      <li>This lipstick is very drying and you could feel the ridges and lines creates lol.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the quality and would order this brand again.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to order more colors to add to my collection.</li>
      <li>I am glad I bought this.</li>
      <li>More like a clown.</li>
      <li>Of course, I made sure not to seductively lick my lips or anything like that because I didn&#x27;t want it to become a part of my diet for the day.</li>
      <li>Even though I titled this \\&quot;Love the lipstick\\&quot;, I gave it four stars because I have one problem with it...</li>
      <li>It was still pretty hot-pinky in the daylight, but under the UV it glows SO bright and looks just like the picture.</li>
      <li>However, I wasn&#x27;t really surprised that it was a matte finish lol.</li>
      <li>Love it, looks awesome in the black light</li>
      <li>If you are doing a black light photo shoot, this is the perfect product.</li>
      <li>Make sure to prime your makeup first!</li>
      <li>Its a very bright pink.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not looking to be a walking light stick anyway...</li>
      <li>But once it is under a black light, it shines beautifully.</li>
      <li>it glows really cool.</li>
      <li>although that would be kinda cool....</li>
      <li>but it only looks good in pix.</li>
      <li>The room has to be full of Uv lights and must apply it often.</li>
      <li>Pink lip stick worked perfectly with the new 48&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Arrived fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>It worked really well great color lasted all night only needed to re apply once</li>
      <li>works, the color is very pretty</li>
      <li>I liked how it didn&#x27;t need to be right next to the light source to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This lipstick is super fun to wear when you go out.</li>
      <li>, WILL ADMIT THAT ITS MORE NOTICIBLE IN BLUE LIGHT</li>
      <li>this is a fun lipstick.  </li>
      <li>fun color even daylight.</li>
      <li>It will get everywhere, so be careful when you apply it so that it looks good when the lights go off and isn&#x27;t all over your face.</li>
      <li>Definitely fun to wear at the clubs, raves, or any type of UV setting venue</li>
      <li>Looks good in black light as well as in regular light, very fun for parties.</li>
      <li>, it does actually glow in the dark which is awesome.</li>
      <li>I tried wearing it at a club and looks like normal lipstick, they had uv light and didnt showed up like the picture.</li>
      <li>Fun product, can only wear very lightly otherwise</li>
      <li>The glow is very strong when right up to a black light.</li>
      <li>My only advise for this product is to make sure your lips aren&#x27;t crusty.</li>
      <li>Very orange but still a lot of fun.</li>
      <li>Would definitely buy again :)</li>
      <li>but once applied its a nice pink..  </li>
      <li>and it lit up amazingly with the black lights</li>
      <li>Make sure to scrub your lips for dry flakes on your lips and apply a moisturizing chapstick before using this.</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>The color is more like a burgundy than pink.</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>Such a fun lipstick!</li>
      <li>I love this product, it definitely glows in the black light.  </li>
      <li>My 13 y/o had a black light birthday party and this lipstick was a hit!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>It works perfectly, but don&#x27;t be afraid to put a lot on!</li>
      <li>It glows orange and looks pretty gross on lips.</li>
      <li>Wanted some lipstick that would glow under black light and this was just what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>There is a sticker that says not for cosmetic use, yet it is clearly advertised as lipstick here and in the pamphlet</li>
      <li>The only thing I have to complain about is that the color is much darker when you put it on.</li>
      <li>We ignored it and had no trouble with using it as lipstick.</li>
      <li>But other then that it was fun to wear.</li>
      <li>I will add black light makeup the next time I use.</li>
      <li>Be careful who and where you kiss, too ;)&lt;</li>
      <li>I wish it GLOWED pink instead of being pink in the light.</li>
      <li>black light fixtures that I bought not too long ago.</li>
      <li>but the texture of it feels kind of weird when you apply it on your lips...</li>

<li> but the texture of it feels kind of weird when you apply it on your lips...</li>
<li> The color in the daytime is like a light red color, so not too bad very wearable during the day/evening time.</li>
<li> Other than that, there is also a perfume to it or some sort.</li>
<li> Only think to think about is the fact that if you have crowns on your teeth (or fake teeth), you will look a bit silly if you smile with the neon lipstick and gray teeth!</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;It is not a glowing or shown under UV black light&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
<li> Bottom line the lipstick felt very cheap as you apply it on uour lips sort of crumbly after a while of having it on and it has a horrible waxy taste to it.</li>
<li> However, it glows when it&#x27;s on your lips, and only faintly does when it&#x27;s on your skin.</li>
<li> It makes my food taste weird</li>
<li> That was weird.</li>
<li> it feels horrible on the lips ugly color not the same color as the picture do not buy this product.</li>
<li> It also has a bad taste.  </li>
<li> bad</li>
<li> I hate tasting my lipstick with scent when I&#x27;m eating.</li>
<li> I hated the color to see if it glowed and nothing.</li>
<li> Very bad product&lt;br /&gt;Not as it is written in a recipe</li>
<li> very bad lipstick</li>

    <li> LOOKED SO GREAT!  Even after running a 5k, still there.  Still glowing.  Highly recommend.  Was a gorgeous color on all of us.</li>

    <li> My 13 y/o had a black light birthday party and this lipstick was a hit! It definitely glows!! She did not have to use a lot to make it glow! Such a fun lipstick!</li>
    <li> This lip stick was great for a bachelorette party! Its a very bright pink. The glow is very strong when right up to a black light.</li>
    <li> I wish it GLOWED pink instead of being pink in the light. It glows orange and looks pretty gross on lips. Not what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> The tube says that you&#x27;re not supposed to use it as lipstick at all. So what did I do? Use it as lipstick. Of course, I made sure not to seductively lick my lips or anything like that because I didn&#x27;t want it to become a part of my diet for the day. I really like this product, it does actually glow in the dark which is awesome. However, it glows when it&#x27;s on your lips, and only faintly does when it&#x27;s on your skin.

    <li> depends on what you&#x27;re looking for. if you&#x27;re looking for something that glows, it works well. but the texture of it feels kind of weird when you apply it on your lips...</li>
    <li> I love this product, it definitely glows in the black light.  I would recommend to everyone.  I will add black light makeup the next time I use.</li>
    <li> this is a fun lipstick.  Definitely glows in UV lights.  It&#x27;s actually a nice color to wear even in daylight.  I am glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any glow at all. The color is more like a burgundy than pink. It also has a bad taste.  I wore this out even tho I hated the color to see if it glowed and nothing.</li>
    <li> Arrived fairly quickly. Fun product, can only wear very lightly otherwise it looks clownish.</li>
    <li> I tried wearing it at a club and looks like normal lipstick, they had uv light and didnt showed up like the picture.</li>
    <li> Oily but looks great. Make sure to prime your makeup first!</li>
    <li> This lipstick is terrific! Looks good in black light as well as in regular light, very fun for parties. Only think to think about is the fact that if you have crowns on your teeth (or fake teeth), you will look a bit silly if you smile with the neon lipstick and gray teeth! But that is not the lipstick&#x27;s fault.</li>
    <li> Very orange but still a lot of fun.</li>
    <li> it glows really cool. but it only looks good in pix.</li>
    <li> Love it, looks awesome in the black light</li>
    <li> the color is bright. The room has to be full of Uv lights and must apply it often. But other then that it was fun to wear.</li>
    <li> it looks purple/red  but once applied its a nice pink..  i cant wait to usde it at EDC LV &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> WE USED THIS FOR A GLOW PARTY AND IT WAS GREAT, WILL ADMIT THAT ITS MORE NOTICIBLE IN BLUE LIGHT</li>
    <li> It was still pretty hot-pinky in the daylight, but under the UV it glows SO bright and looks just like the picture. I liked how it didn&#x27;t need to be right next to the light source to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It will get everywhere, so be careful when you apply it so that it looks good when the lights go off and isn&#x27;t all over your face. Be careful who and where you kiss, too ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. There is a sticker that says not for cosmetic use, yet it is clearly advertised as lipstick here and in the pamphlet they mail with it. That was weird. We ignored it and had no trouble with using it as lipstick.</li>

    <li> fun color even daylight. not as luminous as the picture, but got tons of compliments regardless. Lasts 30 minutes tops.</li>
    <li> Meh. Not even this color. More like a clown.</li>
    <li> Very bad product&lt;br /&gt;Not as it is written in a recipe&lt;br /&gt;It is not a glowing or shown under UV black light&lt;br /&gt;Very bad</li>
