      <li>This stuff smell great and gives you very supple skin.</li>
      <li>so I am doubly pleased with Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s refreshing.</li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and this one is another winner.  </li>
      <li>No need to say more &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>And with a touching movements with my towel I remove the excess of water.</li>
      <li>It actually makes me thirsty for some good lemonade!</li>
      <li>This is the first product I have found that is a really effective moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
      <li>It is a light lemon scent.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for my growing baby belly and it keeps me smooth and itch-free.  </li>
      <li>but this stuff has me itch free.</li>
      <li>since some say derma rolling isn&#x27;t good on areas near the tummy while pregnant,I hope it works tho</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first couple of times I tried it, I thought was okay.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh and moisturizing!</li>
      <li>This body oil smells really nice and is really light, not heavy like some bath oils can be.</li>
      <li>It works great for dry hands too.</li>
      <li>I am loving it so far!</li>
      <li>I like that the oil  is light and very quickly absorbed so that you don&#x27;t have a problem waiting to get dressed after you apply it.  </li>
      <li>-- I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>She uses it every night after a shower and it has so far been effective at keeping eczematic symptoms under control.</li>
      <li>Seems to absorb quickly and does not leave an oily film.</li>
      <li>ABSORBS QUICKLY INTO YOUR SKIN.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very aware of odors and whether my body feels \\&quot;different.\\</li>
      <li>The smell is quite strong, much stronger than the Nature&#x27;s Bounty oil, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and no one else around me seems to notice</li>
      <li>Has such a nice mild smell, I will be getting this again.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic too, so soothing and gentle.</li>
      <li>This product smells of freshly squeezed lemons and I find it to be soothing.</li>
      <li>Well I like its fresh lemon smell.</li>
      <li>A larger bottle would be nice ( or perhaps a 55 gallon drum).</li>
      <li>Worth the Price.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s even worth smelling like an end table and cleaning the tub out after every use.</li>
      <li>It makes my normally sensitive and dry skin silky smooth and amazing smelling!</li>
      <li>Although I generally don&#x27;t like perfumes/scents I find the mild lemon fragrance to be appealing.</li>
      <li>I started using this because I am pregnant with my first child and started noticing stretchmarks.  </li>
      <li>Keep it right in the shower and use before you towel off.</li>
      <li>The smell is just lovely but mild enough to not bother my hyper-sensitive pregnancy</li>
      <li>i heard that vitamin e is supposed to be really good for stretch marks, and i have dark ones on my hips, and i plan on using this oil in conjunction with my derma roller and mederma stretch mark cream after i give birth,</li>
      <li>I was initially intrigued because of all the great reviews so went to a local drug store to check it out.  </li>
      <li>One massage persontold me is better to apply oil on our body after a shower/bath because our bodies are warm and lotion is cold, so is better to apply oil which is not cold as lotion.</li>
      <li>my skin felt kinda \\&quot;weird\\&quot; and I thought it was my imagination at first.  </li>
      <li>keeps my skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>next time I will buy more</li>
      <li>love this stuff, and can&#x27;t find it in local stores.</li>
      <li>I have given this to several folks and they all love it.</li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees items are known for their consistent quality.</li>
      <li>The bottles had no seal, only a piece of scotch tape on top of bottle.</li>
      <li>I am not big on perfumes so the light scent that disappears quickly is also a plus in my book.  </li>
      <li>This works amazingly well for tendinitis, or any kind of skin irritation or pain, due to the vitamin E and other botanicals in it.</li>
      <li>In the process of this it was used over several surgery scars on my feet which were bright red.  </li>
      <li>If you love lemon meringue pie as much as I do, but really shouldn&#x27;t be eating it, you will thank me for this negative review :)))</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this oil. I always add it to the bath water for myself and my baby. It always keeps my skin so soft. It smells fantastic too, so soothing and gentle. It works great for dry hands too. Just drop a couple of drop on your palms and spread. Yummm...</li>
    <li> My mom wanted bath oil for her birthday, but she has very sensitive skin.  I purchased Burt&#x27;s Bees their products aren&#x27;t fragranced with irritating chemicals.  Since giving this to her, my mom has given this bath oil the highest reviews!  She&#x27;s a picky customer, so it must be good!</li>
    <li> In the winter, my skin gets very dry and nothing seems to work as well as putting this on after each shower and following up with a bit of lubriderm.  I use it daily and it really works to keep my skin from drying out.  Even if I skip the application of lotion, I always use this immediately upon leaving the shower.  I like that the oil  is light and very quickly absorbed so that you don&#x27;t have a problem waiting to get dressed after you apply it.  I am not big on perfumes so the light scent that disappears quickly is also a plus in my book.  I have given this to several folks and they all love it.</li>
    <li> nice smell and does the job</li>
    <li> The bottles had no seal, only a piece of scotch tape on top of bottle. Is this even a new product?????</li>
    <li> This is the best oil or lotion I have ever used.  If you have dry skin try this.  I also used it on an old scar and the scar actually got better.  I won&#x27;t be without it now. The bottles are very small, but you only need a few drops to do the trick.  Its great for your cuticles too. And its not greasy like baby oil can be.</li>
    <li> I learned about this oil from a health and beauty magazine.  The writer had recommended it as a good base oil/ moisturizer to use daily.  I tried it and loved it.  And I do use it daily.  And, because it has such a light scent it is safe to use it along with other body lotions.  The lemon scent will not interfere.      I use it both in my bath or immediately after a shower, while my body is still damp (to help penetrate the oil).  It really works well.  And I love that it has Vitamin E oil in it, as it is known to be effective in maintaining the skin&#x27;s oil balance during cleansing.    I only wish it came in large containers.  Although I must admit the 4-ounce size does last a while!  Bottom line -- I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My dry skin loves this product and I like the lemony scent.  It smells very similar to lemon-scented dish detergent.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that keeps my skin soft and smooth in the harsh NE winters. I put it on after a shower. Love the subtle lemon smell which fades away after a little while. The oil absorbs very well and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy at all. When I see my friends scratching because of dry winter skin, I recommend this. I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 or 7 years. Two bottles get me through the winter.</li>
    <li> I LOOOVEEEEE this stuff! It makes my normally sensitive and dry skin silky smooth and amazing smelling! No need to say more &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This works amazingly well for tendinitis, or any kind of skin irritation or pain, due to the vitamin E and other botanicals in it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil after a shower and absolutely love it.  In the process of this it was used over several surgery scars on my feet which were bright red.  I swear after a week of use the scars have faded dramatically from the bright red back to closer to my skin tone, with still a lighter little red line of the scar.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the oil or not, but seems too coincidential not to mention.  So I doubly love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I really like this oil because for 1 it has helped solved my problem of itchy belly syndrome from pregnancy lol, its like my skin just got REALLY sensitive my last month, and lotions and cocoa butter weren&#x27;t really doing the job but this stuff has me itch free. Plus my boifriend always tells me i smell good after i put this on both in the morning and at night before i go 2 bed. AND you dnt need a lot at all, a nickel size drop covers my big belly (haha) hips and the top part of my thighs so i will hae my two bottles for a LOOONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also i heard that vitamin e is supposed to be really good for stretch marks, and i have dark ones on my hips, and i plan on using this oil in conjunction with my derma roller and mederma stretch mark cream after i give birth, since some say derma rolling isn&#x27;t good on areas near the tummy while pregnant,I hope it works tho</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this for my wife for several years. She uses it after shower/bath as a moisturizer. Nice light lemon scent and no complaints from me on the way it makes her skin feel. Seems to absorb quickly and does not leave an oily film. As another reviewer mentioned, if used as a bath oil will leave a slippery film in the tub. Burt&#x27;s Bees items are known for their consistent quality. A larger bottle would be nice ( or perhaps a 55 gallon drum).</li>
    <li> This body oil smells really nice and is really light, not heavy like some bath oils can be. It&#x27;s refreshing. Just be careful not to slip after you drain the tub, it makes the surface really slippery.</li>
    <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bees lemon &amp; vitamin e bath &amp; body oil is a great product. It feels great and smells even better. BUY IT.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and this one is another winner.  I use oils in the bath and after the shower to keep my skin moisturized, especially in the winter.  I usually use straight vitamin e oil, but decided to try this one.  A bit heavier than what I&#x27;m used to, but smells great and absorbs well.</li>
    <li> love this stuff, and can&#x27;t find it in local stores.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT BURT&#x27;S BEE OIL FOR MY WIFE AND SHE LOVES IT. NOT STICKY OR OILY. ABSORBS QUICKLY INTO YOUR SKIN.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like lemon, don&#x27;t order this product - if you&#x27;re like me, on the other hand, and you do like lemon, order a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderfully lemony and moisturizes very well.  You want to be careful not to overdo it since this is an oil, but once you have the right amount down oils make lotions look like a joke.  No lotion can beat the moisturizing properties of an oil for healing dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best bath and body oil I have tried, you&#x27;ll be glad it comes in a pack of two!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this oil! It&#x27;s fresh and moisturizing!</li>
    <li> It is great I love it. I use it after each bath and rub down completely with it. keeps my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> love it. when lotion doesn&#x27;t work, burt&#x27;s bees body oil does. it takes a while to get used to the portion, but once you nail it, you&#x27;ll never go back to lotion again!</li>
    <li> My son has eczema and I use this along with the burt&#x27;s bees bubble bath. It doesn&#x27;t cause him to break out and he gets out of the tub with soft skin and smelling great!</li>
    <li> I read through countless reviews on this product, and was still reluctant because afterall it&#x27;s oil.  I&#x27;m very aware of odors and whether my body feels \\&quot;different.\\&quot; I&#x27;m practically OCD about making things \\&quot;normal\\&quot; again when something&#x27;s off. Although it was a bit greasy, it was tolerable, even for me.  I just rubbed it all over my body after a shower, then dabbed it off with a towel.  You definitely know it&#x27;s still there, but it&#x27;s not overly greasy. It has a great citrus smell. Very refreshing.  The smell helps me tolerate the fact that I have oil all over my body, \\&quot;it&#x27;s not like dirty greasy cooking oil... *shudders* Just vitamin E. Good for the body.\\&quot; I was actually hunting down something natural that I can use on my stretch marks and c-section scar, and my friend recommended just plain vitamin E oil. So I came across this one.  After a few weeks of use, my stretch marks were about 80% gone, and my c-section scar?  That was the most impressive.  It started out so dark and thick.  But by the time I stopped using the oil (only because I got lazy), it was 90% gone.  Half of the scar was gone, while the other half was a lot lighter and on the precipice of disappearing altogether too.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a major fan of body oil without the synthetic chemicals. I&#x27;m also a big fan of lemon scented products so I am doubly pleased with Burt&#x27;s Bees. This stuff smell great and gives you very supple skin. Just apply a small amount on damp skin right after a shower and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the first product I have found that is a really effective moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  It is a light lemon scent.  The oil is absorbs well (most oils end up on my clothes and don&#x27;t moisturize my skin).  All natural ingredients.  The bottles are smaller than I realized when ordering, but as are show which is 4 ozs - half a cup.</li>
    <li> I REALLY wanted to like this.  I have been looking for a good, inexpensive bath oil for a long time and I&#x27;m sad to say this isn&#x27;t it.  I was initially intrigued because of all the great reviews so went to a local drug store to check it out.  I must admit...I love the scent!  I wish I could just smell it without actually using it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of times I tried it, I thought was okay.  When I got out of the tub my skin felt kinda \\&quot;weird\\&quot; and I thought it was my imagination at first.  Then when I went through the list of ingredients, I noticed there was canola oil in it.  I have never heard of using canola oil on the skin and can&#x27;t imaging why BB would use this, except as a filler.  I went on to try it a couple more times, though, but just came to hate it.  It left a weird thick film on my skin--kinda sticky and hard.  I can&#x27;t quite explain it but I&#x27;m guessing canola oil probably does not penetrate skin too well, thus the icky feeling.  I have always used pure oils in my baths (sweet almond, vitamin E, and jojoba) and they work great!  The only problem is they&#x27;re kinda boring because there is very little scent once in the bath water.  But I&#x27;m going to stick to those because they always made my skin super soft, they don&#x27;t clog up my pores, and I never felt greasy afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s a good thing this didn&#x27;t work out for me because every time I smelled it I&#x27;d get bad cravings for lemon meringue pie!  If you love lemon meringue pie as much as I do, but really shouldn&#x27;t be eating it, you will thank me for this negative review :)))</li>
    <li> I bought this to apply to my four post surgery incisions. Not straight away of course, but once the skin has knitted together, this oil works well for softening the skin and I think it helps with the healing process too.</li>
    <li> World&#x27;s best bath oil!</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my daughter who has some scarring.  With the vitamin E and lemon we figured it would help with the healing and hiding properties.  Checked into various websites and some said that this combo would work but it didn&#x27;t for her.  Love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and have used them before the company branched out and became a household name.  This product just didn&#x27;t work as well as we expected.</li>
    <li> I used this oil to cook vegetable for my little baby girl, and she loves it. very great. next time I will buy more</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this lemon &amp; vitamin E body oil.  It is not oily and makes my body feel very soft</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to help with the prevention of pregnancy stretch marks.  It smells wonderful and absorbs quickly.  I am loving it so far!</li>
    <li> a couple drops, rub on wet skin staright out of the shower, allow to air dry. I have persistant dry, scaley , itchy, painful skin every winter and this is magic!</li>
    <li> Well I like its fresh lemon smell. Cute little bottle. Perfect to use after bath. Moisturize effect not so obvious.</li>
    <li> My wife has suffered from chronic eczema for a couple of years. It has affected all of her limbs and gotten worse during her two pregnancies. She tried many over-the-counter creams/lotions as well as steroidal ointments prescribed by a doctor. In addition to medical treatment to control flare-ups, this oil is part of her prevention routine. She uses it every night after a shower and it has so far been effective at keeping eczematic symptoms under control. Although I generally don&#x27;t like perfumes/scents I find the mild lemon fragrance to be appealing.</li>
    <li> I started using this because I am pregnant with my first child and started noticing stretchmarks.  This stuff minimizes the appearance of them and prevents further ones from developing.  It truly moisturizes your skin, but must be applied at least 2x/day.</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using it for my growing baby belly and it keeps me smooth and itch-free.  The smell is just lovely but mild enough to not bother my hyper-sensitive pregnancy sniffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my very dry leg skin and it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve used so far!  Where my skin used to crack and flake it is now nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using vitamin e oil on my face and hands (knuckles) for a few years, but this is the first time I tried the Burt&#x27;s Bees product. Generally speaking, I have problem free skin, but I sometimes develop mild acne due to stress and exercise. I typically apply after washing my face before bed, after shaving or after a shower. I&#x27;ve tried Jojoba oil, but I prefer to use that as a preshave and prefer to use the vitamin e nightly. When I wake up my skin is revitalized, smooth and usually free from any acne that was present or was developing from the previous day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil seems to absorb better than the Nature&#x27;s Bounty brand (the only other one I&#x27;ve tried), but will still leave your face somewhat greasy if too much is applied. This product smells of freshly squeezed lemons and I find it to be soothing. It actually makes me thirsty for some good lemonade! The smell is quite strong, much stronger than the Nature&#x27;s Bounty oil, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and no one else around me seems to notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nature&#x27;s Bounty oil is about the consistency of room temperature olive oil and the Burt&#x27;s Bees oil is like warmed olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived wrapped in a \\&quot;ready to ship\\&quot; plastic bag which was placed inside a shipping box. The shipping box was about 2x too big and no additional padding was included. The bottles did not have any sort of seal under the cap or any plastic protective wrap outside the cap. Products like this should have a seal or protective wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for the oil, 3 stars for the lack of seal/protective wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE 7/20/12****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product nightly for the past week or so and my skin couldn&#x27;t be better! A friend of mine developed a rash on their arms (small red bumps) and I suggested to use this product and within 3 days or about 3 applications later, the rash is nearly gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate to purchase this product again. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Perfect for a massage:) so nice. And I use it on my baby&#x27;s skin, and it helps relax her before bedtime.</li>
    <li> I luv how thick this body oil is. It really penetrates deeply and leaves skin smooth for a long time.</li>
    <li> Worth the Price.  I have extremely dry skin with exzema.  I put this in my bath water and on my skin after. The combo of oils in this product is unbeatable and so gentle I&#x27;ve used it on baby skin in the past and on patches on my face. Smells wonderful too.</li>
    <li> It smells like furniture polish, it leaves a residue in the tub, it&#x27;s expensive and the packaging could be better. But it works! If you are like me, spend some time outdoors in the winter, have dry itchy skin on you hands and legs (especially your shins) and have been looking for relief, this is the stuff. After about 3 or 4 uses in the bath, no more night time scratching, my hands lost the reptile look, and my distress and discomfort level dropped like a rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a man, it&#x27;s even worth smelling like an end table and cleaning the tub out after every use.</li>
    <li> I bough it because my main problem was a itchy legs after taking a shower. I searched on the web and lot of people have same problem and lots of them put baby oil after a shower. What I do is this: I take a shower, when finished I close the water and I apply oil all over my body, including under arm, between legs, tummy, butt... And with a touching movements with my towel I remove the excess of water. I don&#x27;t rub on my to keep the oil on. I get dress as normal. I do this with my 2 years old toddler. One massage persontold me is better to apply oil on our body after a shower/bath because our bodies are warm and lotion is cold, so is better to apply oil which is not cold as lotion. Recommended.... :) As a prime mom I get 20% off when subscribed to 5 or more items to receive every month. I get diapers, wipes, organic chia seeds, deodorant, this oil, toilet paper and I get 20% off.... what a good deal.</li>
    <li> Love this oil, it can be used everywhere.  Has such a nice mild smell, I will be getting this again.</li>
    <li> I love this--winters are long in MN, and this product keeps my skin from getting itchy and dry. Keep it right in the shower and use before you towel off.</li>
    <li> I love this body oil!  I use it during the dry winter months after the shower when my skin is still damp.  The smell is lovely and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. I can&#x27;t find this locally for some reason, so very glad I can get it on Amazon.</li>
