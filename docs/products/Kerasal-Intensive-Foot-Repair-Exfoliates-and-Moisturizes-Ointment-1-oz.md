      <li>Heels become soft and supple, and even improves the skin around your toenails, making your pedi that much better!</li>
      <li>I use this every day, and my feet are nice and soft now.  </li>

      <li>This is the only foot treatment that I have found to be effective.</li>

      <li>The skin on my heels and balls of my feet in particular needs special attention and this product takes care of that.</li>
      <li>Otherwise at first it feels like you want to wash it off or put socks on...</li>
      <li>I apparently was also expecting some pain relief which was not the case, as a moisturizing ointment it is just fine.</li>
      <li>When I read the positive reviews of this product, I decided to try it.</li>
      <li>This is great for scaly, tough feet.  </li>
      <li>feet will be saying thank you so very often ,</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re ready for sandals.</li>

      <li>Fast service,soothing</li>

      <li>They do work, not as much as I wish, but they do something.</li>
      <li>My feet were so much softer after just two days.</li>
      <li>My feet can become super dry in the winter months and this ointment keeps them soft and smooth.</li>

      <li>this is another thing to live for&lt;br /&gt;your</li>

<li> This is the only ointment that helps with my dry cracked heels.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s the only thing that works on my dry heels.  </li>
<li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR A LONG TIME.  </li>
<li> Took a long time to work.</li>
<li> To be honest, I&#x27;ve gotten about the same results using just plain petroleum jelly which is much less expensive.</li>
<li> This is my go-to solution for dry, cracked heels and it works every time.</li>
<li> it helps my extremely dry heals.</li>
<li> I have very dry soles.</li>
<li> This stuff works wonders for your rough, scaly feet.</li>
<li> I wear flats a lot, so the heels of my feet tend to get rough.</li>
<li> They were rough, calloused and shredding.</li>
<li> use it every other day and you will see results within a few weeks and with constant use</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used Kerasal in the past but was dismayed when local retailers stopped stocking it.</li>
<li> I use it in connection with the other product made by Kerasal</li>
<li> woks just as it is expected!</li>
<li> Little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; but works well for horribly dry and cracking feet.</li>
<li> But...for so much less I found Kerasal.</li>
<li> Just rub a thin layer on heels at night and there is major improvement by morning.</li>
<li> This past winter was so harsh that my hands got dry as well, so I put some on them and voila!</li>
<li> Also, you have to be diligent in putting it on everyday.</li>
<li> I have very hard skin on my feet due to diabetes.</li>
<li> Makes ugly, nasty looking skin in certain areas of the foot and heel become healthfully smooth.</li>
<li> After about a month the hard skin softened and the peeling cycle subsided.</li>
<li> The cream softens really tough hard skin.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so expensive to keep buying these small tubes.</li>
<li> I hate cracked heels, and while you can improve the appearance with regular petroleum jelly</li>
<li> I am obsessed with my feet and have not found anything like it.  </li>
<li> It progressively got worse over the course of 4 years to the point where my hands were hardened and peeling so badly that I could not grip anything.</li>
<li> I have had a \\&quot;bad foot\\&quot; for about 10 years.</li>
<li> My \\&quot;bad foot\\&quot; is no longer a disgraceful sight.</li>

    <li> I bought this for my dogs front paws. They were rough, calloused and shredding. I put it on at night with some baby socks and in two days they were 100% better.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders for your rough, scaly feet. This is the only thing I have ever found that actually works. Takes about a week to see full results, but they are beautiful! Heels become soft and supple, and even improves the skin around your toenails, making your pedi that much better!</li>
    <li> I wear flats a lot, so the heels of my feet tend to get rough. When I read the positive reviews of this product, I decided to try it. After 6 weeks of applying each night after my bath (immediately placed socks on my feet), I noticed no improvement. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> 5 STARS AND 100% WORTH EVERY PENNY! My feet were literally like moccasin bottoms. I actually thought about a skin peel on my feet! But...for so much less I found Kerasal. I put it on for 2 days and voila I have baby soft feet. I bought them all and love them all.&lt;br /&gt;FYI: after applying the cream you got to wait a few minutes and it will absorb in. Otherwise at first it feels like you want to wash it off or put socks on...just wait :))&lt;br /&gt;This is the one item that I will never be without, ever. Right there with my lipstick and mascara.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of treatments for softening my feet skin. They do work, not as much as I wish, but they do something. Let me put it this way: is worst not to use anything. I thought Kerasal was going to be the one I was looking for, like magic (maybe I was expecting too much), but it worked as well as others I&#x27;ve tried (including a mix of retinol, glycolic acid and vitamin C).</li>
    <li> I have very dry soles. This works great for me.</li>
    <li> The only one that really works. I have tried everything. This works because it has salicylic acid.</li>
    <li> This is great for scaly, tough feet.  I use this a couple of times a week, overnight, with cotton socks on my feet to allow the product to stay on and penetrate.  Outside of professional pedicures, this is one of the best things I&#x27;ve found to soften and exfoliate my feet and heels. And no scrubbing required!</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR A LONG TIME.  IT IS NECESSARY TO USE ON A NIGHTLY BASIS FOR BEST RESULTS.</li>
    <li> What a great product to remove calluses and make your feet smooth</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for a couple years now. it is by far the best product for cracked feet in the world. use it every other day and you will see results within a few weeks and with constant use you&#x27;ll have beautiful feet forever!</li>
    <li> I use this every day, and my feet are nice and soft now.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for calluses, but dry skin goes away in a few days.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders, but it a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I would give this 20 stars if I could! I was diagnosed with exfoliative keratolysis, aka focal palmar peeling of the hands. It progressively got worse over the course of 4 years to the point where my hands were hardened and peeling so badly that I could not grip anything. It was so embarrassing, my hands looked awful and I swear people thought I had some contagious disease! The dermatologist was no help and there was not enough hand cream in the world to soften and smooth my hands. I decided to try this, basically with nothing to lose. I applied it every night under cotton gloves. After about a month the hard skin softened and the peeling cycle subsided. My hands only look minority&#x27;s dry after getting wet, but now my regular cocoa butter lotion makes it look and feel better. I am truly thrilled that I was patient enough to see results! I will never sleep another night without this on my hands!</li>
    <li> This is the best foot moisture ointment I have every tried. I would like to use it on my face, but the directions don&#x27;t say that is okay.</li>
    <li> I love these ointments they make your feet so nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had horrible cracking, peeling, painful calluses on my feet for over 10 years. Regular pedicures and every foot cream known to man couldn&#x27;t really touch them. I thought I had tried everything, but when I saw Kerasal hanging in the footcare aisle at Walmart I decided to give it a try. My expectations were zero, but THE NEXT DAY I noticed a difference, and within three days my calluses were GONE! The look on my pedicurists&#x27; face was hilarious. She couldn&#x27;t believe the shape of my feet – thought I&#x27;d been cheating on her. And I had...</li>
    <li> I think this is one of the best products I have ever used for my callused heals</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help me get rid of the callus on my toe, I would never order it again.  I did use it dailey for over  two weeks</li>
    <li> I hate cracked heels, and while you can improve the appearance with regular petroleum jelly this cream also exfoliates.  I am obsessed with my feet and have not found anything like it.  Cannot find it in any regular pharmacy (CVS/Walgreens) and/or superstore (Walmart/Target).  Thank god for Amazon</li>
    <li> I love this foot ointment. My feet can become super dry in the winter months and this ointment keeps them soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. Its the only ointment I will use!</li>
    <li> woks just as it is expected! I am using this cream for years and works just perfect, I will recommend it to my friends</li>
    <li> I have used Kerasal for years.  It&#x27;s the only thing that works on my dry heels.  I&#x27;ve tried many other things, but using Kerasal ointment each night and a pumice each morning has FINALLY gotten it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick and easy, and on-time as always with prime</li>

    <li> To be honest, I&#x27;ve gotten about the same results using just plain petroleum jelly which is much less expensive. Had I known that&lt;br /&gt;was the main ingredient, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it.</li>
    <li> I have had a \\&quot;bad foot\\&quot; for about 10 years. I thought I had tried everything. I saw an ad for this product in Prevention magazine and right away placed an order through Amazon.com. I began to see results very soon. My \\&quot;bad foot\\&quot; is no longer a disgraceful sight. I am wearing sandels again!!!!!</li>
    <li> great product and good seervice</li>
    <li> I am hooked on this stuff!!! I felt a difference after the 2nd use..I will continue to purchase and my next order I will buy two.</li>
    <li> Very effective on rough skin to exfoliate without hurting.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  The only thing that stops my feet from drying out and getting sore!  I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE sell it in bigger tubes or a jar or something.  It&#x27;s so expensive to keep buying these small tubes.</li>
    <li> Great product. With daily use this product does exactly what it claims to do. Makes ugly, nasty looking skin in certain areas of the foot and heel become healthfully smooth.</li>
    <li> It really works great for your feet.  If you have severe diabetes however I would recommend something stronger.  Also, you have to be diligent in putting it on everyday.</li>
    <li> best product ever for foot roughness.  cannot find it in drugstores anymore.  excellent service.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to solution for dry, cracked heels and it works every time. Just rub a thin layer on heels at night and there is major improvement by morning. Three or four nights of treatment and you&#x27;re ready for sandals. This past winter was so harsh that my hands got dry as well, so I put some on them and voila! Much better by morning. This is a great product that I&#x27;ve shared with family and friends. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> this is another thing to live for&lt;br /&gt;your feet will be saying thank you so very often ,after cleansing take some time is show your love your mate will appreciate it .and don&#x27;t forget the compliments that you will receive ,so go ahead and pamper your feet</li>
    <li> Little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; but works well for horribly dry and cracking feet. I use it in connection with the other product made by Kerasal</li>
    <li> I apparently was also expecting some pain relief which was not the case, as a moisturizing ointment it is just fine.</li>

    <li> This is the best over-the-counter exfoliating / moisturizer foot therapy I have found.  I found that it works best after a shower and using a pumice stone on the really rough areas.  My feet were so much softer after just two days.</li>

    <li> This is the only ointment that helps with my dry cracked heels.  I use it every night. Works great for me</li>
    <li> Miracle worker! I put on before bed and then put on those socks and I notice a difference in a couple days.</li>
    <li> This is the only foot treatment that I have found to be effective.</li>
    <li> The cream softens really tough hard skin. it is worth  a try and you will be hooked! it works overnight</li>
    <li> i put this on at night and leave it on over night with socks on.  it helps my extremely dry heals.</li>
    <li> Fast service,soothing</li>
