      <li>Never thought I&#x27;d be so in love with a hair product...</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>So I bought some online, and this isn&#x27;t a spray more like a pump and rub lotion.</li>
      <li>My hair is so fried out from bleaching for many years that I needed something strong and</li>
      <li>Nothing leaked out the bottle during transportation as packaging was clean!</li>
      <li>Smells nice very light doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily and my hair look much healthier before putting heat on it</li>
      <li>This product works well and combs out easily and is not an overpowering smell.  </li>
      <li>This product is great for getting protein back into your hair.</li>
      <li>Really work -:)</li>
      <li>The Anti Snap works great along with the Redken Extreme Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel smooth and light which i love being that I had damaged my hair with bleach not to long ago.</li>
      <li>the way I have shoulder-length fine straight brown hair.</li>
      <li>I love this product and can only say I have fine hair</li>
      <li>Makes it very soft and strong.</li>
      <li>I will totally buy more and maybe the shampoo conditioner combo.</li>
      <li>and this is the first product that I put on.  </li>
      <li>Great if your hair is dry &amp; breaks from being processed or blown dry too much.</li>
      <li>Really helped my distressed hair.</li>
      <li>I have really frizzy, unmanageable hair</li>

      <li>For the first time in life, I get compliments on my hair--and not just sometimes, but frequently.</li>

      <li>Has become hard to find &amp; I love</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick but product was not new!!!</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and this product allows it to look natural</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s face it, nothing is going to reverse damage, BUT, what this product will do, is save your hair from breaking off more, at least buying you time to let it grow.</li>
      <li>but the hair is soft.  </li>
      <li>It makes strands stretch &amp; makes hair soft.</li>
      <li>BTW, I also started using a tiny bit of coconut oil in my hair right after this (right after the shower) and it keeps my hair tame</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is light and does not weigh down my thin &amp; fine</li>
      <li>So far, I never regret it and in fact, I just ordered a pair with biggest size, shipped by Amazon recently.</li>

<li> It makes strands stretch &amp; makes hair soft.</li>
<li> BTW, I also started using a tiny bit of coconut oil in my hair right after this (right after the shower) and it keeps my hair tame</li>
<li> /&gt;It is light and does not weigh down my thin &amp; fine</li>
<li> So far, I never regret it and in fact, I just ordered a pair with biggest size, shipped by Amazon recently.</li>
<li> Always apply to damp, towel dry hair (a dime size for short to med length and a quarter for everyone else), blow dry on low after you have completely worked product through.</li>
<li> this is working well so far - it is easier to comb out when wet and not as frizzy when dry</li>
<li> Typically, after a haircut within a few months I have a significant amount of dead ends</li>
<li> I simply cannot, not, use the Redken Extreme Anti Snap.</li>
<li> but so do other conditioners I have used at a far less price.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that when I let my hair air dry, it tends to get frizzy but when I let it air dry after using this product, it tends to refrain from frizziness.</li>
<li> I would recommend for anybody that dies their hair or lives in dry environments.</li>
<li> Only received half a bottel...</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t need to use any other products at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I put it on after using extreme shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
<li> but I also rub some on my hands and rub it through my hair even when my hair is dry, to keep staticky little flyaways down during/after brushing.</li>
<li> Brought a pair (Shampoo/Conditioner) in other salon store just to try as my hair is brittle due to chemicals when it was straightened few months ago.</li>
<li> I believe it would work well for any type of hair - thick or thin, straight or curly.</li>
<li> but I cannot see that it didn&#x27;t anymore than a less priced leave in conditioner has done for my hair.</li>
<li> At least, it&#x27;s long now.</li>
<li> and this does not weight it down,Yet leaves my hair with body , without it my hair lays limp</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used a few chemical products in my hair and it literally started to just break off.</li>
<li> I have very very thick curly long hair.</li>
<li> Plus I have a very oily scalp that I am very skeptical they might give me dandruffs.</li>
<li> I have thick, wavy hair</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t look awful, but all of a sudden my hair was 6-8 inches shorter!!  </li>
<li> This product works shockingly well.</li>

    <li> Has become hard to find &amp; I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light and does not weigh down my thin &amp; fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making it available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order arrived promptly and well packaged.</li>
    <li> Great product, really works to save hair from breakage.</li>
    <li> Smells nice very light doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily and my hair look much healthier before putting heat on it</li>
    <li> I simply cannot, not, use the Redken Extreme Anti Snap. It makes my hair feel smooth and light which i love being that I had damaged my hair with bleach not to long ago. The Anti Snap works great along with the Redken Extreme Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price!</li>
    <li> It is a great leave in but I cannot see that it didn&#x27;t anymore than a less priced leave in conditioner has done for my hair. It did what it said it would do but so do other conditioners I have used at a far less price.</li>
    <li> My hair is so fried out from bleaching for many years that I needed something strong and this is working well so far - it is easier to comb out when wet and not as frizzy when dry</li>
    <li> I have been using this product off and on for years.  I love the way it makes my hair feel softer.  I am 58 and hair usually starts getting more straw like.  This product works great.  I put it on after using extreme shampoo and conditioner.  It smells really good and fresh also.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for years...love it.</li>
    <li> This product works well and combs out easily and is not an overpowering smell.  I have naturally curly hair and this product allows it to look natural and I don&#x27;t comb it out when it dries but the hair is soft.  CAD</li>
    <li> Works great on my damaged hair. Makes it very soft and strong.</li>
    <li> I love this product and can only say I have fine hair and this does not weight it down,Yet leaves my hair with body , without it my hair lays limp</li>
    <li> I have really frizzy, unmanageable hair so I must use a flat-iron to control it.  I apply this product after washing and conditioning my hair, using it as a leave-in styling lotion. It smells great and it seems to give my hair a smoother look and feel.</li>
    <li> I have very very thick curly long hair. At least, it&#x27;s long now. I&#x27;ve used a few chemical products in my hair and it literally started to just break off. It didn&#x27;t look awful, but all of a sudden my hair was 6-8 inches shorter!!  I went to costcutters, of all places, and the hair dresser there convinced me to buy this . I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6mos and my hair is almost back to it&#x27;s original length and isn&#x27;t breaking off and falling out the way it was.  I would buy it in bulk if I could.  BTW, I also started using a tiny bit of coconut oil in my hair right after this (right after the shower) and it keeps my hair tame and I don&#x27;t need to use any other products at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now.. about the greys....</li>
    <li> As a health and beauty connoisseur, I can tell you, if you are someone with over processed hair (chemical, mechanical...) This is your product. Always apply to damp, towel dry hair (a dime size for short to med length and a quarter for everyone else), blow dry on low after you have completely worked product through. Let&#x27;s face it, nothing is going to reverse damage, BUT, what this product will do, is save your hair from breaking off more, at least buying you time to let it grow. I recommend Redken to clients, I&#x27;ve always loved the Redken line...and being able to get it at Amazon is a huge bonus. Gotta Love Prime!</li>
    <li> Never thought I&#x27;d be so in love with a hair product... I use Redken&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner now too but if I had to choose just one of the three products to stick with, it&#x27;d be this anti-snap. They say to rub it into damp hair but I also rub some on my hands and rub it through my hair even when my hair is dry, to keep staticky little flyaways down during/after brushing. For the first time in life, I get compliments on my hair--and not just sometimes, but frequently. Smells nice too (salon-like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way I have shoulder-length fine straight brown hair.</li>
    <li> Really helped my distressed hair.</li>
    <li> Only received half a bottel... Delivery was quick but product was not new!!! Nothing leaked out the bottle during transportation as packaging was clean!</li>
    <li> Great if your hair is dry &amp; breaks from being processed or blown dry too much. It makes strands stretch &amp; makes hair soft. Don&#x27;t need a lot for great results.</li>
    <li> Love it !Really work -:)</li>
    <li> Brought a pair (Shampoo/Conditioner) in other salon store just to try as my hair is brittle due to chemicals when it was straightened few months ago. Plus I have a very oily scalp that I am very skeptical they might give me dandruffs. Since I now started to color my hair due to slight gray areas, I needed a great shampoo/conditioner that meet my needs. So far, I never regret it and in fact, I just ordered a pair with biggest size, shipped by Amazon recently. Will used this again!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, helps frizzy hair be conditioned and revitalized. I would recommend for anybody that dies their hair or lives in dry environments.</li>
    <li> I went to great clips to get my hair trimmed and they used a spray version of this. I been bleaching and coloring my hair and they said this stuff helps hair a lot. I saw a change instantly when she used it. So I bought some online, and this isn&#x27;t a spray more like a pump and rub lotion. I don&#x27;t mind I used it as soon as it was here and my hair looks great and smells great. I will totally buy more and maybe the shampoo conditioner combo.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the product works great :)</li>
    <li> This thing is great. Since I started using it, my hair stopped falling like before.&lt;br /&gt;definitely will recommend it for any one who is having a problem with the hair loss.</li>
    <li> I over dye my hair. This product is great for getting protein back into your hair.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Saved my hair!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this to me for my over-processed hair. I love it.</li>
    <li> I had been dying, straightening, waving, curling and blow drying my hair for years so you can imagine how damaged it was. My aunt suggested I use this product and I did. This product works shockingly well. Typically, after a haircut within a few months I have a significant amount of dead ends but I have not had a haircut in a year and now I struggle to find a split end! I&#x27;ve also noticed that when I let my hair air dry, it tends to get frizzy but when I let it air dry after using this product, it tends to refrain from frizziness. My hair feels strong and healthy!</li>
    <li> I use this product every time I wash my hair.  I have thick, wavy hair and this is the first product that I put on.  It is a wonderful conditioner and leaves my hair feeling great.  It also has a delicious smell.  I believe it would work well for any type of hair - thick or thin, straight or curly.</li>
