      <li>I have always loved this fragrance since the day i first wore it almost 3 yrs ago.</li>
      <li>a really great honeysuckle smell, very natural and not at all over powering.</li>
      <li>The initial smell is awesome but it wears off quickly.  </li>
      <li>The seller did a fine job with packaging and shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>When I ordered it this year I thought it would have the same great smell...</li>
      <li>It took forever to arrive and then when it got here, I didn&#x27;t enjoy the scent.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend this perfume/body mist if you like a nice light floral fragrance.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this perfume the first time I smelled it.</li>
      <li>A clean scent.  </li>
      <li>I love perfume and was pleased to find a rendition of one of my old favorites: Honeysuckle.  </li>
      <li>Clean and sweet.</li>
      <li>I did, however, receive it quickly and in good condition, and it is a pleasant fragrance to use when I do not want to use up my more expensive brands.  </li>
      <li>The scent is light and fresh- not too perfumey....</li>
      <li>This is one of my absolute favorite perfumes that bath and body works has ever come out with.</li>

      <li>I personally can&#x27;t stand how strong and floral this body spray is</li>
      <li>It lasts all day, and really does smell like honeysuckle.</li>
      <li>My thanks to Amazon.com and all the sellers ..</li>
      <li>amazon has been the only place i could find it, was really excited to see it here.</li>
      <li>I first unpackaged it, I tried to pump it many, many times ( like 3 dozen times), I gave up and thought I&#x27;d finally gotten a poor product from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It even came with a little chocolate candy inside my package :)</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the Bath and Body Works stores where I live, even on the B&amp;BW&#x27;s website.</li>
      <li>The last fragrance I used years ago was Chloe, which I liked very much but eventally thought it was a little too obvious and quit using it.  </li>
      <li>Mild enough to wear daily.</li>
      <li>Enjoyed it but fragrance does not last very long, so I think I&#x27;ll keep looking for another seller with similar product.</li>
      <li>This is a large bottle- twice the size of a regular perfume bottle.  </li>
      <li>At least it was cheap &amp; fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>Came back and half-heartedly tried a few more pumps and it</li>
      <li>Not a very heavy scent.</li>

    <li> I love the smell of this new fragrance it was a great thing to have at all time. Thank you so very much for this item.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a very special friend and she was wowed by it since she had been unable to find in stores ... My thanks to Amazon.com and all the sellers .. I would by from THIS seller again ...</li>
    <li> I am so glad I was able to find this scent online, B&amp;B works has discontinued this scent- to my great dismay!  It was one of my favorites!  So glad I found it here!  The scent is light and fresh- not too perfumey.... This is a large bottle- twice the size of a regular perfume bottle.  Should last a long time!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Have always used this. It has a light scent, not overpowering. Can be worn for day and evening wear. Will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this fragrance since the day i first wore it almost 3 yrs ago. Then bath and body discontinued it i was crushed. So when i found it here i was so happy and so is my boyfriend he absoluetly loves it when i wear it.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this perfume the first time I smelled it. Every time I wear it I think of late night summer drives through the country with the windows wide open and the smell of honeysuckle would come wafting through and you&#x27;d just take a moment to inhale before it was gone. I was heart broken when they discontinued it, as well as a similar scent, butterfly flower. I ordered a ton of it off the bath and body website, but when I run out(which may be quite a while) hopefully they&#x27;ll re-issue it or I can still find it here.</li>
    <li> Wish they still sold this in stores -but glad to find it online.  Paired with the lotion and the shower gel .... Great products!</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic! It doesn&#x27;t last as long as i would like but still smells awesome!! I would still recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my absolute favorite perfumes that bath and body works has ever come out with. It lasts all day, and really does smell like honeysuckle.</li>
    <li> I personally can&#x27;t stand how strong and floral this body spray is but I got it for my mom who loves it. She really enjoyed it!</li>
    <li> My sister loves this scent and its sorta discontinued... I&#x27;m so glad the seller had this on stock. Sweet and pleasant fragrance. Mild enough to wear daily. Clean and sweet. Very nice.</li>
    <li> i went by the reviews .  The initial smell is awesome but it wears off quickly.  At least it was cheap &amp; fast shipping.  I will be looking for authentic honeysuckle perfume.</li>
    <li> Not a very heavy scent. Love the smell but it is very, very light. Would like it to have been stronger. Great service .</li>
    <li> I love perfume and was pleased to find a rendition of one of my old favorites: Honeysuckle.  I typically prefer high-end perfumes, however this fragrance was well worth the few dollars that I spent.  It has a light honeysuckle aroma (just as I remembered), and I immediately received positive comments.

    <li> The seller did a fine job with packaging and shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little disappointed with the perfume because it doesn&#x27;t really smell like honey suckles to me at all. It smells nice, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like what it&#x27;s advertised to be.</li>
    <li> Smells just like honeysuckle.&lt;br /&gt;It is good. My daughter wanted it and she got it.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it very much.</li>
    <li> It actually smells like honeysuckle! It&#x27;s such a nice scent to use during the summer or spring. I may get another bottle.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful! It&#x27;s a nice size spray bottle. The bottle is plastic not glass. I prefer glass not plastic, but it does not affect the perfumes fragrance. I highly recommend this perfume/body mist if you like a nice light floral fragrance.</li>
    <li> This was sold in Bath and Body works last year...I loved the smell of it...When I ordered it this year I thought it would have the same great smell...It did not...not even close...what a disappointment..since then I have learned Bath and Body works will not have it in stock in their stores anymore...</li>
    <li> This fragrance takes me back a long time ago.  It&#x27;s great to be able to do that.  My girlfriend loves it as well.</li>
    <li> I love this! It lasts a decent amount of time, and it smells so fresh and delicious, floral but not overly so. I think it&#x27;s been discontinued :(</li>
    <li> I love the smell of honey suckle. This has a great smell at first but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> When I wear this it smells wonderful. A clean scent.  Just spray a little and it is just perfect for a spring or summer scent.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this signature scent! Couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the Bath and Body Works stores where I live, even on the B&amp;BW&#x27;s website. I came to Amazon and lo and behold, I found it...and it was shipped to me the same day I ordered it and I received it 3 days later! It even came with a little chocolate candy inside my package :)</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  I have always been happy with products from Amazon and buy A LOt from Amazon.  I am lazy, though, and have never reviewed a product before.  But because of a couple of adverse reviews (and I always study reviews before I buy), I want to relay my experience with this spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first unpackaged it, I tried to pump it many, many times ( like 3 dozen times), I gave up and thought I&#x27;d finally gotten a poor product from Amazon.  I was going to give it a poor review but walked away from it for a few minutes and got involved in other things.  Came back and half-heartedly tried a few more pumps and it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is wonderful and I haven&#x27;t worn any fragrance at all for years (because they&#x27;re usually so overwhelming) but I couldn&#x27;t resist the thought of finding a floral scent at a good price and honeysuckle is my favorite flower of all time.  The last fragrance I used years ago was Chloe, which I liked very much but eventally thought it was a little too obvious and quit using it.  Chloe lovers might like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is sublime and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Enjoyed it but fragrance does not last very long, so I think I&#x27;ll keep looking for another seller with similar product.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite bath and body works scent for the warm seasons and it was discontinued a couple of years ago.  amazon has been the only place i could find it, was really excited to see it here. a really great honeysuckle smell, very natural and not at all over powering. perfect for that kiss of summer on your skin!</li>
    <li> Bottle was semi open so a lot of the perfume was all over the inside of the package. It took forever to arrive and then when it got here, I didn&#x27;t enjoy the scent.</li>
