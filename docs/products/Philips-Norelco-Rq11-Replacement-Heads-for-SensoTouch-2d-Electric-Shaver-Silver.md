    <li> Exactly what we ordered.  It fit the razor perfectly.  The cost was affordable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing to see the difference when you just replace these shaving heads. You&#x27;ll immediately feel the difference. I generally replace them every 6 months or so. (I do so on Amazon&#x27;s subscription to keep me from forgetting to do it.)</li>
    <li> After about a dozen uses the whole top piece poped off of the razor. The green plastic clip holding the cutting blades in place came off. I have not been able to to get the green clip back into place.  The same happened to the original head.  The razor is useless, not what I would have expected from a Norelco product.

    <li> They&#x27;re great heads for shaving. However, I&#x27;m not too crazy about their high costs. I don&#x27;t think anyone here is.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still cheaper than buying Gillette Mach blades.&lt;br /&gt;I can actually get a good year&#x27;s use out of the head with proper cleaning and a drop of cutter oil each use.</li>
    <li> Head is great as expected. Amazon had sevecral listings for Norelco Head and this one for Heads. This was slighttly more than others - I assumed incorrectly it was two heads. It was not, it was one.&lt;br /&gt;So I got the head I wanted at a little higher than the lowest price and I think the listing for it was misleading.</li>
    <li> I originally gave the razor a good review but after a month it started skipping badly.  I thought maybe it just had a bad blade so got a new one.  The new one did the same thing after a month.  I was gentle with it and took good care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could undo my original review of the razer.</li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as close as it should.</li>
    <li> Fit good/worked good.  Closer shave.</li>
    <li> Works great using generic shave cream and just gliding the shaver heads over the face with slight pressure in circular motions. More pressure tends to cause in-grown hairs.</li>
    <li> The product is first class, efficient, does a great job in cutting my whiskers, and leaves my face smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I received my order in less than a week.  I am very satisfied with my orders on Amazon.</li>

    <li> As I expected it is a very good product</li>
    <li> Excellent blades my razor is like née again. I will definitely order more!</li>
    <li> Replacing heads on all of our razors.  Love the close contact that these razors are able to get to make a clean shaved face!</li>
    <li> Looks chintzy... not the quality of the original head.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads arrived quickly and were easy to install in my husband&#x27;s Norelco shaver.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping... Item as described....</li>
    <li> These replacement blades are great and easy to keep clean so there is less wear on the razor motor. I think they are outstanding.</li>
    <li> This razor is the best. I use it when I travel weekly. It shaves ALMOST as good as my double-edge razor which is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Norelco RQ 11 replaced the heads I had before.</li>
