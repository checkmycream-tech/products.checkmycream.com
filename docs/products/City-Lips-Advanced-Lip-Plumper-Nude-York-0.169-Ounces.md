### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best lip conditioner ever.  </li>
      <li>Very good product</li>
      <li>great for chap lips</li>
      <li>Great moisture.</li>
      <li>The color, Nude York, is great if you want just a glossy look but haven&#x27;t seen the &#x27;fuller lips&#x27; side of it.  </li>
      <li>The color was very nice and it shines like a gloss.  </li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Whoever invented city lips, I love you!</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE city lips!</li>
      <li>first of all the customer service was great.</li>
      <li>The gloss does stay longer than most.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had enough time for this to &#x27;plump&#x27; my lips but the color is awesome.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay,</li>
      <li>but more of an apricot shimmer, which doesn&#x27;t look well on me.</li>
      <li>I love the feel on my lips and absolutely love the new nude color.  </li>
      <li>love it , it really works.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a happy customer &amp; will order other colors too.</li>
      <li>It seemed to work for the first couple weeks, but after that, it&#x27;s just glorified lip gloss.  </li>
      <li>Plumps the lips on the first try.</li>
      <li>Not sure this really works, but it does look good.</li>
      <li>but no where near worth what it costs.</li>
      <li>my lips are naturally so much thicker, I don&#x27;t even have to put it on all the time.</li>
      <li>Product was delivered at a reasonable time.</li>
      <li>Like I said I have tried so many different products for many of my insecurities and this is the only product that actually worked.</li>
      <li>When I first purchased it from their website, I had a wrong shipping address by accident, and when I called them the lady on the phone was super nice.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried soooooooo many products in the past - products that claim to make my acne prone skin clear, creams that supposedly make your small boobs bigger(lol) and more.</li>
      <li>I used this product faithfully several times a day for weeks, and I cannot see any positive changes in my lips</li>
      <li>this a completely fraudulent claim.  </li>
      <li>Luscious lips even for a 70 year old like myself.  </li>
      <li>I saw no difference whatsoever as far as a lip plumper.  </li>
      <li>Most of them didn&#x27;t live up to expectations, except for city lips that made my thin lips bigger, and certain dri antiperspirant that made my arm pits stop sweating.</li>
      <li>I bought this and found that it does not due what it promises.</li>
      <li>but so far my lips look the same.  </li>

    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of difference, but I don&#x27;t wear it everyday.  Does not sting.</li>
    <li> I expected fuller lips</li>
    <li> Too thick and sticky for mt liking!!</li>
    <li> this product does not work as advertized was told in the pkg it coulnt be returned I wonder how many unhappy woman are going to feel the same not good</li>
    <li> Too small of a tube! I had no idea that it would be a mini version of a lip gloss! Not enough to tel any difference</li>
    <li> Luscious lips even for a 70 year old like myself.  Gave one to my daughter. She loves the color and awaiting the results</li>
    <li> Great moisture. ..but so far my lips look the same.  I use it morning and night. I will keep using it a little longer and see what happens.</li>
    <li> I like the softness of the product on my lips, but I do not notice plumping as advertised. It is a bit expensive to achieve softness that other less expensive products can do equally well.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend on her birthday because I heard her talking about it one day. When she used it in front of me I could even see a difference myself. She raves on and on about it, and now her and her sisters and mom all use it too. I would definitely recommend this as a gift if you&#x27;re not sure what to get someone cause all the girls in my life go crazy for it!</li>
    <li> this a completely fraudulent claim.  All it is, is a lip gloss. and a very expensive one at that. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> love it , it really works. I will keep buying it . You need to try it .  great for chap lips</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had enough time for this to &#x27;plump&#x27; my lips but the color is awesome. I love it!  I&#x27;m a happy customer &amp; will order other colors too.</li>
    <li> I have used another conditioner llip plumper for years.  This is my 3rd tube of the City Lips.  I love the feel on my lips and absolutely love the new nude color.  It is all I wear.  I would definately encourage you to try this product.</li>
    <li> I found the product thick &amp; slightly sticky.  I saw no difference whatsoever as far as a lip plumper.  Also it was not what I would call &#x27;nude&#x27; in color but more of an apricot shimmer, which doesn&#x27;t look well on me.</li>
    <li> Best lip conditioner ever.  Use City Lips and never have dry dull lips again.  I wear it with lipstick and without - you can&#x27;t go wrong and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This product is tingly, and it does make your lips shine. I noticed plump lips on initial use, none after that.</li>
    <li> The color was very nice and it shines like a gloss.  I didn&#x27;t notice any plumping of my lips.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered at a reasonable time. However, I don&#x27;t see one ounce of difference. Would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> Love it! Plumps the lips on the first try. Very good product</li>
    <li> I bought this to see if it works; have used it for a week but not seen any results yet.  The color, Nude York, is great if you want just a glossy look but haven&#x27;t seen the &#x27;fuller lips&#x27; side of it.  The gloss does stay longer than most.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  I don&#x27;t know if it even does what it claims because the tiny tube had nothing in it.  It was dry.  It was expensive and I feel it was a rip off.</li>
    <li> I used this product faithfully several times a day for weeks, and I cannot see any positive changes in my lips</li>
    <li> Not sure this really works, but it does look good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m basically insecure about every part of my body and face and I&#x27;ve tried soooooooo many products in the past - products that claim to make my acne prone skin clear, creams that supposedly make your small boobs bigger(lol) and more. Most of them didn&#x27;t live up to expectations, except for city lips that made my thin lips bigger, and certain dri antiperspirant that made my arm pits stop sweating. I LOVE LOVE LOVE city lips! first of all the customer service was great. When I first purchased it from their website, I had a wrong shipping address by accident, and when I called them the lady on the phone was super nice. Second this product actually works. The first time I tried it I was meh about it because my lips got this burning sensation and my lips started itching and felt uncomfortable and it didnt plump up that much. The next day when I applied it though, my lips burnt but they were definitely plumper. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for about a month now and my lips are naturally so much thicker, I don&#x27;t even have to put it on all the time. Like I said I have tried so many different products for many of my insecurities and this is the only product that actually worked. Whoever invented city lips, I love you!</li>
    <li> I bought this and found that it does not due what it promises. I use it now for lip color. This turned out to be expensive lip gloss!!! I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very thick and greasy, so it stays on well.  It seemed to work for the first couple weeks, but after that, it&#x27;s just glorified lip gloss.  It&#x27;s okay, but no where near worth what it costs.</li>
    <li> This is the worst Lip Plumper! The lip Plumper did not work at all. Don&#x27;t Buy. This product is very expensive. What a rip-off!</li>
