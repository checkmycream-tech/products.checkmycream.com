      <li>Great fragrance and quality tonic!  </li>

      <li>I would describe the smell as  a nice , mellow orange odor.  </li>
      <li>Nice item and</li>

      <li>/&gt;Leaves the hair very easy to comb.</li>

      <li>Been using Eau de Portugal for more than 30 years..  </li>
      <li>I am pleased, I will reccommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>But okay stuff.</li>
      <li>Thanks for your great service.</li>
      <li>So glad we found this product at Amazon.</li>
      <li>OK.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure when I ordered this...</li>
      <li>It smells more herbal woodsy and fruity.</li>
      <li>I love the product..</li>
      <li>Overall, a great hair tonic!</li>
      <li>i will be buying this one again for sure</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I just wish that the scent will linger more...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good product for a very reasonable product.</li>
      <li>This has a nice light orange scent and holds my fine hair well.</li>
      <li>If I wasn&#x27;t  very true and factual, and excitied by this product,  I would not sit here and type all this to lie to somebody.  </li>
      <li>The smell is  awesome, it has a smell of fresh citrus, only better.  </li>
      <li>,as well you can splash it in you hair and apply pomade to it,it gives you a wet-slick look with great shine for that Old Silver screen Hollywood look...</li>
      <li>I keep my hair at 1/8th of an inch, but I wanted something to keep my scalp healthy and clean.  </li>
      <li>- doesn&#x27;t hold hair like a gel but is great for a tonic - cooling - soft effect with light fragrance.</li>
      <li>Any one that says that this stuff is too strong must have bathed in it.  </li>
      <li>as strong as it once was</li>
      <li>the difference is how strong of a fragrance do you like.</li>
      <li>all was good ,this item must be new.  </li>
      <li>I still think the plastic bottle detracts from a quality product but more and more companies are going this way so it may not be fair to single it out on this criteria.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s non oily or greasy, it put a very nice shine on my hair and no dry scalp build up</li>
      <li>It has a strong clean citrus smell.  </li>
      <li>It has a light citrus scent.  </li>
      <li>It  is light, not greasy and keeps your hair in place.</li>
      <li>Maybe the darker tonics don&#x27;t work well for people with light hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Quinine has too much of a perfume fragrance for my liking yet I am sure many men would like that one as well.</li>
      <li>when you put it in your hair it feels very cool and works as a very mild style hair hold .Great for summer time on hot days.</li>
      <li>But seriously folks, I love the orange smell and this stuff does a good job of helping me keep my hair in some kind of order.  </li>
      <li>Solid value with pleasant fragerance.</li>
      <li>If you want a &#x27;wake you up&#x27; product that smells like a cool summer breeze with an orange juice tornado ravageing through your hair...</li>
      <li>This is a really nice hair tonic that I remember the barber used when I was a young child.</li>
      <li>this is lovely and keeps his hair gently in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>husband has fine hair which the Clubman Eau De Portugal gently holds in place all day with an light linger of citrus scent.</li>
      <li>I love Clubman&#x27;s many products, especially this hair tonic, but be aware that it is for LIGHT HAIR, so it is specially formulated to not cause oily hair (which I happen to like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is not greasy or oily like the Lucky Tiger Tonic, yet it does help hold your hair in place.</li>
      <li>Luckily Amazon has it.  </li>
      <li>If it had a bit more essential oils this would be a much better product.</li>
      <li>This stuff, is highly invigorating, splash on your head and neck, wow, very refreshing and awakening.  </li>
      <li>My next hair tonic will be a diferent scent, but this is nice.</li>
      <li>The smell is quite good and not over-whelming and only lasts for a few minutes (a good thing IMO).  </li>
      <li>Worth a try for the price.</li>
      <li>worth a try.</li>
      <li>Believe me,  its  worth the price...</li>
      <li>, that stood out, was the cooling-tingling sensation you get right as you&#x27;re massaging it into your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t know what exactly it does.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Lately I have been using a cheap nearly odorless baby oil to groom&lt;</li>
      <li>and if I do not find a better tonic I will most likely be coming back to this.  </li>
      <li>The orange fragrance is refreshing, the tonic is light and does not mat the hair down like a gel or pommade.</li>
      <li>On the positive side, it doesn&#x27;t clash with Vitalis or Breelcreme.</li>
      <li>and it pretty much stays put throughout the day without feeling greasy at all.  </li>
      <li>The Eau De Portugal definitely smelled better and has a little more of a fresh \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; on the scalp when I applied it to damp hair after a shower.</li>
      <li>Like other Clubman hair tonics, this has not holding power or frizz reduction for fine hair--in my experience--but feels and smells good and acts as a wetting agent for other hair control products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this item is good I like the smell, I hope everyone else does. all was good ,this item must be new.  thanks</li>
    <li> Everything is AOK. Clubman Eau De Portugal 12.5 oz. arrived on time. I am pleased, I will reccommend this to anyone. I will do business with this company again. Thanks for your great service.</li>
    <li> I had to delete my other review on this product, somehow it got mixed up with another product, that wasn&#x27;t so good.  Now, about this product,  I have  just received my second bottle.  This stuff, is highly invigorating, splash on your head and neck, wow, very refreshing and awakening.  The smell is  awesome, it has a smell of fresh citrus, only better.  I hope this stuff was made by the gallon.  I have still got a lot of the first bottle left.    I just ordered the second bottle, so I won&#x27;t run out.  I telling you,  it&#x27;s refreshing and behond.  I am not concerned about my hair,  it feels very  invigorating on your sclap and neck.  Somehow,  it feels that,  it does good for your scalp and neck.  I can&#x27;t understand why some reviewers, gave  this product a \\&quot;wammy\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s not a hair cream or wax,  its a scalp refresher and removes dandruff and unwanted particles from your sclap.  If I wasn&#x27;t  very true and factual, and excitied by this product,  I would not sit here and type all this to lie to somebody.  By the way I don&#x27;t work for anybody.  The reason I said that, is some reviewers has accused me of working for the company that I gave a high review of a product.  Believe me,  its  worth the price...</li>
    <li> Wonderful, Non greasy and provides for an invigorating scalp rub. The citrus aroma is tops - almost smells as if someone peeled an orange. A great adjunct to Eau de Quinine.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice hair tonic that I remember the barber used when I was a young child. The orange fragrance is refreshing, the tonic is light and does not mat the hair down like a gel or pommade. I also purchased the Clubman Quinine hair tonic the same purchase but I don&#x27;t like the fragrance as much as this one. The Quinine has too much of a perfume fragrance for my liking yet I am sure many men would like that one as well. You will be happy with the Eau De Portugal.</li>
    <li> This says it&#x27;s a formula for light hair, but I don&#x27;t know what that means, as I have dark hair, and this seems to work as well as my other Clubman hair tonics.  Maybe the darker tonics don&#x27;t work well for people with light hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the scent is great, and works well as a tonic.</li>
    <li> I love the product..I just wish that the scent will linger more...its refreshing not to oily for the hair,as well you can splash it in you hair and apply pomade to it,it gives you a wet-slick look with great shine for that Old Silver screen Hollywood look...this product has been around before I was born,take it from a young man that loves old stuff this remind me.When my old man just to take me with him to get his hair cut at the Barber Shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
    <li> Great Price &amp; Quick Shipping. Highly Recommend. A+++++++</li>
    <li> OK.  Good citrus/orange smell. worth a try.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t leave stains on your scalp/hands, hair.  Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, quite the contrary, and gives a nice shine to your hair.  i will be buying this one again for sure</li>
    <li> Takes over where the shampoo leaves off.  Really cleanses the scalp and invigorates the skin. it feels like it is scrubbing the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A manly aroma. A manly feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time because it takes only a little each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves the hair very easy to comb.</li>
    <li> Good product that works well.  Wish the scent lasted longer.  I wear it when I DON&#x27;T want a scent that will linger or project.  Another good Clubman product.</li>
    <li> Been using Eau de Portugal for more than 30 years..  To save production costs Pinaud switched to plastic bottles from glass, and has been cutting the amount of Orange Blossum scent.   The plastic bottles is no big deal, but the cutting of percentage of Orange Blossum scent to total volume is a big blow, and reduces the experience from the original by quite a bit.  Even so I can&#x27;t give up Eau de Portugal, but when used reminds me always of the missing difference.</li>
    <li> It smells like gasoline.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nothing like the other &amp;#34;Clubman Pinaud Eau de Portugal Hair Tonic&amp;#34; products I&#x27;ve purchased before and certainly not like the scent I&#x27;ve grown to love. BUYER BEWARE. Still trying to find a way to get a refund. Absolutely abysmal.</li>
    <li> Great hair tonic if your scalp itches.  Not greasy. Use before blow drying.  A product barbers used for years.  Luckily Amazon has it.  You only need to use a couple of drops at a time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to hair tonics. I shower at night so I wanted something that I could put into my hair and scalp so my hair wouldn&#x27;t be dry and hard to manage in the morning. I purchased Eau De Portugal and Vitalis and gave them both a try (two days with Vitalis and two days with Pinaud). The Eau De Portugal definitely smelled better and has a little more of a fresh \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; on the scalp when I applied it to damp hair after a shower. However, once it was dry, so too was my hair. It felt even more dry than when I shampooed and did nothing. The Vitalis, on the other hand, made my hair feel softer and more manageable to style in the morning. So, I&#x27;ve been sticking with the Vitalis (to clarify I only use it as a post-shower tonic, not to style and hold). I&#x27;ll keep the Eau De Portugal in my bathroom cabinet to perhaps re-evaluate at another time.</li>
    <li> I love Clubman&#x27;s many products, especially this hair tonic, but be aware that it is for LIGHT HAIR, so it is specially formulated to not cause oily hair (which I happen to like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent and feeling you get from using it can be described in one word: &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did notice though, that stood out, was the cooling-tingling sensation you get right as you&#x27;re massaging it into your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good product for a very reasonable product.</li>
    <li> I like the clubman products but when I used this on my balding head it caused all of my hair to grow back now I have to get it cut...  ~..~</li>
    <li> Great fragrance and quality tonic!  We only use this Clubman Eau De Portugal, nothing else compares.  We will order again!</li>
    <li> Great Product. Possibly helped to prevent losing my thinning hair during chemotherapy. Difficult to get. Thank you for offering it.</li>
    <li> I hate to be knocked over by a noxious scent of hair tonic or after shave. this is lovely and keeps his hair gently in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has fine hair which the Clubman Eau De Portugal gently holds in place all day with an light linger of citrus scent. He has mention the tingle and whiff of citrus he experiences when applying is invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He always comes to me when he becomes dissatisfied with a personal scented product - somehow I don&#x27;t expect him to become disenchanted with Clubman Eau De Portugal very soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;ve never used a &amp;#34;hair tonic&amp;#34; because it sounds like it&#x27;s something for hippies, or people from France.  I purchased it thought after reading some reviews about how it helps with dandruff control, which it certainly seems to do.  The smell is quite good and not over-whelming and only lasts for a few minutes (a good thing IMO).  I use this product after I get out of the shower each morning, when my hair is still a bit damp, but not sopping wet.  I would purchase this product again, but not in a store where I have to walk up to a cashier.</li>
    <li> I really like the Clubman Eau De Portugal compound hair tonic.  It is not heavy or oily, however, it does help get hair groomed.  Additionally, it has a light pleasant citrus (orange) smell.  Overall, a great hair tonic! The supplier I believe was Cosmetic  Solutions and their pricing was extremely competitive.</li>
    <li> Disappointed with the plastic bottle, there is just something not \\&quot;quality\\&quot; about it. As for the smell, there isn&#x27;t any. Others have mentioned the change. WIsh I had used it sooner so I would know how good it used to be. I will just have to take their word for it. It seems to work. Wouldn&#x27;t order again.    Here it is January 2015 and I have had time to reflect on this purchase. The product&#x27;s smell is pleasant, not overpowering, but does fade quickly. I still think the plastic bottle detracts from a quality product but more and more companies are going this way so it may not be fair to single it out on this criteria. The product does work well on my hair which is probably the main factor. I would (will) upgrade it to a 4 based on having used it for some months now. I may reorder when the time comes.</li>
    <li> This has a nice light orange scent and holds my fine hair well. I also use the Eau de Quinine which has a stronger scent. I find both work equally well the difference is how strong of a fragrance do you like.</li>
    <li> Very nice smelling hair tonic.  I would describe the smell as  a nice , mellow orange odor.  The smell doesn&#x27;t last long, dissipates in about  30 minutes after application , but makes your scalp feel nice.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like. But okay stuff. Does smell good when you can smell it.</li>
    <li> This tonic is very helpful in adding a little structure to thin hair.  It&#x27;s totally invisible and doesn&#x27;t take away the shine of your hair.  It&#x27;s a little lighter than Pinaud&#x27;s Clubman.  The bottle lasts me almost a year.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great - it feels good on the scalp, removes dandruff, smells so good (citrus/orange) and is reasonably priced for 12.5 ounces.  Love it - doesn&#x27;t hold hair like a gel but is great for a tonic - cooling - soft effect with light fragrance.</li>
    <li> I am on a bit of tear, trying all the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; barber shop products. I am trying each product for a day or two, independent of any other products just so I can get feel for each one. I immediately liked this hair tonic, and will be looking to work into my daily routine once I have tried some of the other hair tonics. It has a citrus scent, maybe mandarin orange. I like the scent, but it does not linger so it will not interfere with your aftershave or cologne. It is not greasy or oily like the Lucky Tiger Tonic, yet it does help hold your hair in place. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I keep my hair at 1/8th of an inch, but I wanted something to keep my scalp healthy and clean.  This product is perfect for that.  The cooling effect from the alcohol, topped with the strong orange smell is incredible.</li>
    <li> Bought this formyhusband, and it smells like a Gin &amp; Tonic! It is a great alternative to sticky ointments or hair gels...he uses it for hair &amp; skin and loves it!</li>
    <li> I say maybe I like it because I put it in my hair and comb it and I don&#x27;t know what exactly it does.  I daily use pomade to style my hair, but sometimes use this at night after a shower and Im just not sure what it is supposed to do.  Its like I don&#x27;t even notice its in my hair.  Maybe somebody will clear this up for me.....The scent is not bad, different.</li>
    <li> This is the old-time traditonal product that I have come to love over many a year, but am having trouble finding locally.  Upon ordering, I assumed I would wait several weeks, but to my surprise it turned up so fast that I almost had to duck!  Kudos for this product, and the seller&#x27;s light-speed shipping.</li>
    <li> But seriously folks, I love the orange smell and this stuff does a good job of helping me keep my hair in some kind of order.  I&#x27;ve got fairly thick straight hair that tends to just hang down but after I shower while my hair is still wet I sprinkle a generous dose of this on and rub it in.  Then I comb my hair where I&#x27;d like it to stay and it pretty much stays put throughout the day without feeling greasy at all.  Yeah, you could do the same thing with a lot of other hair products but do they come in a bottle with an old timey label that says, \\&quot;Hair Tonic\\&quot; on them?  Do something crazy-- hit the tonic and live a little! :)</li>
    <li> I can remember this when I was a kid  getting my hair cut at&lt;br /&gt;the neighborhood barber. I loved the smell of it and he always&lt;br /&gt;rubbed some into my hair before he combed it.&lt;br /&gt;Great smell and lasted all day.&lt;br /&gt;Not any more. I bought this and the smell was gone before I&lt;br /&gt;left the bathroom. Not that there was much to begin with. It is&lt;br /&gt;so faint that you can&#x27;t even tell what the odor is.&lt;br /&gt;As for grooming, this junk is nothing but water and glycerine.&lt;br /&gt;You could buy a bottle of glycerine for a couple of bucks and&lt;br /&gt;rub a few drops in your hair if this is what you think a good&lt;br /&gt;grooming product is but it just made my hair look oddly plastered&lt;br /&gt;down. What ever this is, it just ain&#x27;t the real McCoy.&lt;br /&gt;The garbage men took the bottle away with them yesterday!&lt;br /&gt;Lately I have been using a cheap nearly odorless baby oil to groom&lt;br /&gt;with and it is working fine.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a bottle of Eau De Quinine with this and that at least&lt;br /&gt;has a vague semblance to what it used to be. But the odor is no where&lt;br /&gt;near as strong as it once was but it is there.&lt;br /&gt;So I am combining Eau De Quinine with the baby oil and it works!</li>
    <li> This product is as described.  It has a strong clean citrus smell.  I put a little in my hand right after showering and rub it all in my hair.  I don&#x27;t get a tingling sensation, but it smells good.  The smell doesn&#x27;t last long, which is a good thing.  I don&#x27;t want it to clash with my cologne or aftershave.  If you want a &#x27;wake you up&#x27; product that smells like a cool summer breeze with an orange juice tornado ravageing through your hair...lol-then this is for you.  I would recommend this product.  My next hair tonic will be a diferent scent, but this is nice. 5 stars from me.  I really like the old school baber shop smell that Clubman Talc and their hair gel has.  I&#x27;m looking for something similar to that for my next tonic.  I will be using all of this and if I do not find a better tonic I will most likely be coming back to this.  Worth a try for the price.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure when I ordered this...but I&#x27;m happy I did, it&#x27;s non oily or greasy, it put a very nice shine on my hair and no dry scalp build up</li>
    <li> Great smell, good feeling in hair. I just wish it had a little better holding power</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I hate foams and gels and sprays to control hair and they look like they are there.  I have difficult hair to keep combed.  It never seams to stay where I put it in the morning.  Since I started to use Eau De Portugal it has done a great job of staying where I put it without looking all done up.  It has a light citrus scent.  Any one that says that this stuff is too strong must have bathed in it.  What little you use gets further diluted by damp hair.</li>
    <li> The scent is pleasant and nice, but I wish it did more to control the hair. I wouldn&#x27;t mind if the scent lasted longer either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had varying degrees of success using it to tame bedhead, but wouldn&#x27;t trust it as my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; hair care product. Maybe it&#x27;s not intended for that anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, though, I&#x27;ll buy it again and use it as a sort of fragrance rather than as a control or grooming product.</li>
    <li> Solid value with pleasant fragerance.</li>
    <li> Nice item and this is a re-order, so, obvious;y I like it. Thank you so much and stay strong even with those idiots we have in Washington</li>
    <li> I really like all of the scents from Clubman Pinaud&#x27;s line, but hate the alcohol, and harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> At first reading through the reviews I saw that this hair tonic smelled masculine. It smells more herbal woodsy and fruity. However, a great tonic that will leave your hair feeling relaxed and clean.</li>
    <li> Gin, Pleasant and refreshing on my scalp, no holding properties. Smell dissipates rapidly, gals like the smell. Good product&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> I have been using Eau de Quinine and decided to try this. The fragrance is a very light orange, but it almost immediate dissipates. If it had a bit more essential oils this would be a much better product. Like other Clubman hair tonics, this has not holding power or frizz reduction for fine hair--in my experience--but feels and smells good and acts as a wetting agent for other hair control products. On the positive side, it doesn&#x27;t clash with Vitalis or Breelcreme.</li>
    <li> I liked this product much better than the Jeris Hair Tonic. Almost no smell and made my scalp tingle. It also helped with dandruff.</li>
    <li> Appreciate Pinaud&#x27;s Lilac and just tried this. Like it!</li>
    <li> Good for your hair very clean citrus smell when you put it in your hair it feels very cool and works as a very mild style hair hold .Great for summer time on hot days.</li>
    <li> This has a wonderful vintage old world scent.  I really like it and use it as an after shave rather than as a hair tonic.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a vintage scent.</li>
    <li> Every male in our family has used this hair tonic for years. It  is light, not greasy and keeps your hair in place. So glad we found this product at Amazon. Thank you.</li>
