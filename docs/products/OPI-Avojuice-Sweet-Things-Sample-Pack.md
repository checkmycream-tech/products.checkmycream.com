<li> Skin feels sooooo soft and silky INSTANTLY!</li>
<li> Bottles are smaller than I expected...</li>
<li> A very small application covers a large area.  </li>
<li> As a hairdresser my hands are always dry.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t used it as a body lotion but use it for my dry hands (and living where I do, winter is VERY rough on your skin!).</li>
<li> makes your skin softer than any other lotion and is not greasy or oily.</li>
<li> Plus, the bottles are small enough to use for travel or just to carry around in a purse.</li>
<li> I PAID OVER $12 FOR 6 TINY BOTTLES OF SOME LOTION, NOT REAL HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE, OH</li>
<li> LESS THAN A DOLLAR</li>
<li> The smells were a little bland</li>
<li> then I keep one and use the rest as little gifts.</li>
<li> They always feel heavy and oily.</li>
<li> WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WHEN THESE TINY LITTLE BOTTLES ARRIVED THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PURCHASED AT THE STORE FOR</li>
<li> Was hard to tell by the picture though.</li>
<li> Lotion is a little thin</li>
<li> so if you&#x27;re looking for thick and creamy this is not it.</li>
<li> I hate the feeling for normal lotions.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t receive the scents that were specified which was disappointing, but didn&#x27;t feel like dealing with the hassle of returning it.</li>
