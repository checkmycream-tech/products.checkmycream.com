      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels and looks alot more hydrated.</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about Spellbound is the smell.</li>

      <li>Will purchase more</li>
      <li>Being educated in the tanning salon business I should have known better.</li>
      <li>but I can assure you this product was everything I was looking for and more.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>Overall though, this is the BEST lotion I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>and I agree with many of the reviews on this site.</li>
      <li>As an advanced tanner, I had read many reviews on many lotions and being this is one of the most popular used lotions I had to give it a try.</li>
      <li>This product was okay.</li>
      <li>Pleased to know this works just as good now as it did when I first started using it.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my skin silky smooth and truly leaves a beautiful natural looking color.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s more of a rich sun kissed glow.</li>
      <li>It smells great and your skin feels so soft and smooth after applying it.</li>
      <li>but it works great and leaves your skin moisturized and soft with a light fragrance and</li>
      <li>That couldn&#x27;t be more true as I&#x27;ve found out.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light and fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Personally, I really like what I bought and would recommend this lotion to anyone who wants a great product for their tanning experiences.</li>
      <li>I like to aim for a brown color when I tan, and Spellbound gives me more of a golden, sunkissed color but not orange.</li>
      <li>This is, by far, the most effective.</li>
      <li>The smell is clean scented</li>
      <li>Really gives u a great tan in just a few days plus has a nice scent, no burned skin smell.</li>
      <li>Spellbound is overall a good lotion.</li>
      <li>The amount of fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering either, just enough to keep you smelling fresh and clean which I loved about the product.</li>
      <li>Not like other lotions that make you smell baked, but rather it leaves you smelling wonderful and your skin feels soft too.</li>
      <li>It Black its more potent than DS spellbound!</li>
      <li>really worth it</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I think you will be happy with Spellbound if you want good, natural color, but you might want to go with a different lotion if you want to get really dark.</li>
      <li>( I go tanning a couple times a week,) about two months if used in the right amounts.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many lotions: Bombshell, Roar, Black, Mood, and I have to say out of all the non tingles this one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>If you want a nice healthy color that doesn&#x27;t look fake or orange you are going to love this lotion.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and this did help me become quite dark.</li>
      <li>so it feels really smooth going on and makes my skin very soft.</li>
      <li>Yes, I am aware Bombshell has tingles.</li>
      <li>Secondly, other reviews indicated that Spellbound had a great fragrance and left their skin soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice lotion to use at the beginning of the season before I get too dark.</li>
      <li>I tanned extremely fast while using it</li>
      <li>What I love MOST about this tanning lotion is the results you actually see within just a few times of tanning.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>This is normal!</li>
      <li>First, it was at a great price compared to all other retailers, especially the local tanning salons.  </li>
      <li>and i like black better.</li>
      <li>For further note, I have tried this on many different levels of beds and it has worked with all levels for me.</li>
      <li>But I do have to mention that getting a nice deep, dark tan is something that comes with time!</li>
      <li>leaves skin very soft.</li>
      <li>I like to alternate it with my favorite lotion of all time, Worship Me, from time to time just to keep my skin soft and change things up a little bit.</li>
      <li>and it still had a natural bronze appearance ..</li>
      <li>but if you are sensitive to perfume smell</li>
      <li>and it makes my skin luxuriously soft.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin really soft.</li>
      <li>Also, I just bought another bronzer w/ the two main ingredient that gives you an instant tan look with balance!</li>
      <li>love the smell and it makes my skin really soft and helped me get a good base tan!</li>
      <li>But regardless of my compulsion with that one flaw, this is an amazing product and after reading some reviews I was skeptical to purchase</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells so wonderful. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> my wife loves the smell and it works too on getting you a nice color</li>
    <li> love the smell and it makes my skin really soft and helped me get a good base tan! really worth it</li>
    <li> Says what it does and does what it says! Better to use this in indoor tanning. Also, I just bought another bronzer w/ the two main ingredient that gives you an instant tan look with balance! It&#x27;s called Paint It Black its more potent than DS spellbound! I recommend this for indoor and outdoor tanning! The two ingredients you want to look for for that insta-tan look are dihydroxyacetone(DHA) and erythrulose both combined will give an even look! If there&#x27;s just one of them listed you&#x27;ll end up orange or yellow depending on which one it is.</li>
    <li> I tan in a  salon 4 to 5 times a week using Designer Skin Spellbound, in the past I have used Designer Skin BLACK and i like black better. Black gets me darker faster. Spellboung does smell amazing and it works okay. I just need someting that has more bronzing effect. This product was okay.</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion I have ever used. It smells wonderful! I tanned extremely fast while using it and it makes my skin luxuriously soft. Could not ask for more. Worth every penny. I wish it cam in a bigger bottle :(</li>
    <li> I love using this lotion. It makes my skin really soft. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels and looks alot more hydrated. And does seem to add to the life of my tan as well. I totally recommend the product.</li>
    <li> What I love MOST about this tanning lotion is the results you actually see within just a few times of tanning. The smell is amazing and it stays like that after your tanning session. It leaves my skin silky smooth and truly leaves a beautiful natural looking color. Ofcourse like I&#x27;ve said before, everyone is different, so my results may not be yours. Overall though, this is the BEST lotion I have ever tried. It excels in every way!</li>
    <li> As an advanced tanner, I had read many reviews on many lotions and being this is one of the most popular used lotions I had to give it a try. The bottle contains a lot of lotion which seems will last me ( I go tanning a couple times a week,) about two months if used in the right amounts. The smell is clean scented and I can smell a bit of floral. The amount of fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering either, just enough to keep you smelling fresh and clean which I loved about the product. Another thing I do like about this product is that the bronzer itself is amazing. It&#x27;s not streaky or too orange, it&#x27;s more of a rich sun kissed glow. Being that I am medium skin tone, it works amazing. However, I&#x27;ve had a friend who was fair use it and it still had a natural bronze appearance .. not orange at all. The lotion didn&#x27;t stain my clothes which was also a pro to this product. I&#x27;ve used many lotions: Bombshell, Roar, Black, Mood, and I have to say out of all the non tingles this one is my favorite. Yes, I am aware Bombshell has tingles. If you are looking for a tingle lotion, I would recommend Bombshell. Anyways, back to Spellbound there is only one odd con to this product: I dislike that there is a ribbon around the bottle which is unable to be taken off. After awhile, the ribbon gets dirty and the bottle starts to look a bit tacky. But regardless of my compulsion with that one flaw, this is an amazing product and after reading some reviews I was skeptical to purchase but I can assure you this product was everything I was looking for and more. For further note, I have tried this on many different levels of beds and it has worked with all levels for me. Shipping was very fast and the customer service itself was great. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for years now and I agree with many of the reviews on this site. I even agree that the ribbon around the bottle is annoying and gets dirty, but whatever, it&#x27;s not a big deal. This does smell amazing and the bronzer doesn&#x27;t make you orange. But the best thing I love about this lotion that many others have not mentioned is the fact that this is a bronzing lotion that you do not have to worry about taking a shower after your session. Usually with bronzing lotions you want to shower a few hours after your session or else you will get orange. You can tan and go about your day and not worry that it&#x27;s been 5 hours since you tanned and you haven&#x27;t gotten the lotion off yet. I also did not notice any discoloration on my hands or on my clothing. I have fair skin and this did help me become quite dark. But I do have to mention that getting a nice deep, dark tan is something that comes with time! You can buy a lotion with a ton of bronzers to excel your tan, but in the end what it comes down to is that the lotion bronzed and colored your skin, you did not actually get as tan as you think. The lotion just enhanced that dark color. If you want a nice healthy color that doesn&#x27;t look fake or orange you are going to love this lotion. It takes time to get dark. Don&#x27;t be surprised if after a week you&#x27;re not super dark. This is normal! Tanning takes time! Some people tan fast and others tan slow. It can take me two weeks or so to get to the color I want to be at, and trust me I&#x27;ve tried every lotion out there. This is a great lotion! I&#x27;m going to start tanning outside with it and I&#x27;ll report later on how it worked! Designer skin is always a great product.</li>
    <li> Spellbound is overall a good lotion. I have been using Designer Skin products for years and I love them. My favorite thing about Spellbound is the smell. It&#x27;s hard to describe how things smell, but whenever I use it I like the way my skin smells for a while after I tan. It&#x27;s a very light and fresh scent. Also, it has silicone in it so it feels really smooth going on and makes my skin very soft. I like to aim for a brown color when I tan, and Spellbound gives me more of a golden, sunkissed color but not orange. It&#x27;s a nice lotion to use at the beginning of the season before I get too dark. I like to alternate it with my favorite lotion of all time, Worship Me, from time to time just to keep my skin soft and change things up a little bit. I think you will be happy with Spellbound if you want good, natural color, but you might want to go with a different lotion if you want to get really dark.</li>
    <li> I purchased Spellbound from Amazon based on two criteria.  First, it was at a great price compared to all other retailers, especially the local tanning salons.  Secondly, other reviews indicated that Spellbound had a great fragrance and left their skin soft and smooth.  That couldn&#x27;t be more true as I&#x27;ve found out.  This isn&#x27;t the darkest bronzer out there but it works great and leaves your skin moisturized and soft with a light fragrance and not your typical \\&quot;I just got out of the tanning bed\\&quot; cooked smell.  Personally, I really like what I bought and would recommend this lotion to anyone who wants a great product for their tanning experiences.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a so so tanning lotion.  It goes on smooth and it seems to work fairly well, but I just cannot get over the smell.  It is way too perfumy (sp)!!</li>
    <li> This bronzer has a good scent and gives a beautiful tan. I love it! It works great in the tanning bed and even better at the beach. I strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was a little leary buying this online but this product Smells great and worked out very well...I enjoyed this product! Will purchase more</li>
    <li> Excellent product that enhanced my tan dramatically. It also smells phenomenal. Not like other lotions that make you smell baked, but rather it leaves you smelling wonderful and your skin feels soft too. :) Excellent product! I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before in the past, which is why I decided to order it.  I prefer to order on here than pay an arm and a leg for lotion.  Pleased to know this works just as good now as it did when I first started using it.  This doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34; scent, but I always use a tan extender after.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for years and this is my most favorite lotion. It smells great and your skin feels so soft and smooth after applying it. I hope it never gets discontinued!</li>
    <li> When I got this product it was expired by one month. Nothing ever said it was an expired product.A little disappointed but I am still going to use it.</li>
    <li> good product. leaves skin very soft. but if you are sensitive to perfume smell this is not for you. i am very sensitive to smells and cant handle it which is ashame because everything else about the product is great!</li>
    <li> I started using indoor tanning when 14. This is, by far, the most effective. And it&#x27;s not sticky!</li>
    <li> I knew as soon as I placed my order I shouldn&#x27;t have wasted my 26.00!  Being educated in the tanning salon business I should have known better. I ran a test with the real deal and what I purchased from Glamour Tan and it was dramatic ! The bottle I bought was a FAKE! Contacted customer service and I got an email that was more the unprofessional and to top it off called my house at 10:15PM!!! I am sorry but this product is a fake and the customer service department is outrageous!  Would NEVER buy from them again!!</li>
    <li> Really gives u a great tan in just a few days plus has a nice scent, no burned skin smell.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference with this lotion.  Just baby lotion, and you will get better results.  The trick to a nice tan is just to moiturize.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Buying it online saves me a lot of money.</li>
