      <li>I tried it not expecting any miracles, but I certainly see a difference with continued use.</li>

      <li>I have used many eye creams and eye serums, this one was supposed to tighten and firm.  </li>
      <li>and you waste more than is needed.</li>
      <li>I picked this one over my normal eye cream,</li>
      <li>I am 73 years old</li>
      <li>The pump is the only thing that I don&#x27;t care about because it pumps out too much</li>
      <li>but it is not recommended to be use near the eyes.</li>
      <li>So far I like this item that I purchased at Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>If used carefully it will last and be a real bargain.</li>

    <li> Im 43, male, non smoker, athletic, taking many vitamins and suplements. Argenine has help me on keeping my skin tight but my eyes started aging irremediable giving me a tired look. The only cream ive ever tried is mederma which seems to has deleted all my forehead wrinkles but it is not recommended to be use near the eyes. In a final effort make the research and ordered this one. Dont expect inmediate miracles, it will work, but takes at least 2 months to show good results. Dont overdose either, wont help and would be a waste. Some people use it morning and night, i only apply it at night. I know its working when some ladys give me compliments on how good im looking. If used carefully it will last and be a real bargain. Sleeping good will help also.</li>
    <li> This product works really well after a couple of days of use.  But it you stop using for a day...  My eyelids drooped like a wrinkled dog!  I gave it to my mother with the cautionary warning.  I liked the results but the backlast of not using on even one day were upsetting.  It took almost a week for my eyelids to recover and I won&#x27;t use again!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I tried it not expecting any miracles, but I certainly see a difference with continued use. My eyeslids appears much more brighter and younger, as well as firmer.</li>
    <li> I am 73 years old and I try to do my best with what God gave me.I depend on this product to help me out and it does.I t gives me the subtle change I need to look a lot less tired and frankly younger. I can present my best self to the world. Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought a similar BeautiControl product for my mother-in-law, who loved it!  Since I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks, I thought I would buy one for her as well to complete her TFF collection.  The box was significantly dented upon receipt but the actual dispenser was in great condition.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to fill in fine wrinkles and tighten skin, whether in their early 30&#x27;s like me trying to prevent crow&#x27;s feet or in their 60&#x27;s trying to treat wrinkles -- or sun kissed lines as we like to call them!  A great gift and the price was certainly a steal!</li>
    <li> I have used many eye creams and eye serums, this one was supposed to tighten and firm.  The only thing it did for me was to plump up my eyelid and make it look swollen.  I picked this one over my normal eye cream, Bremenn upper eyelid lifter, because the ratings and the reviews were better.  The price was less expensive as well. But everytime I use it I get the same results of puffy upper eyelids.  Now I wish I would have stuck with the Bremenn&#x27;s as I know it works.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product.  I put it on in the evenings before bed and in the morning under my makeup.  I love the product and think it definitely works on wrinkles.  Try it and see!</li>
    <li> This is a really good eye serum.  After just two weeks I can definitely see a difference.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I tried this product from a sample envelope and loved it.  I am so happy I purchased this product. Best one so far.  Trust me I try plenty of products.</li>
    <li> Tightens the skin under my eyes and makes me look rested.  This is the only product I have ever reordered because it does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> You can actually feel this product under the eyes.  It helps a great deal with the fine lines.  The pump is the only thing that I don&#x27;t care about because it pumps out too much and you waste more than is needed.</li>
    <li> Great product for firming skin around eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Could not be without it.</li>
    <li> Regeneration does not regenerate anything. It dosn&#x27;t fill anything or firm.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice texture, not sticky or heavy but saw no effect after 3 weeks. Sorry I purchased from Spa_Diva brcause they don&#x27;t allow returns.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really seem to lift around my eyes like a product that I get from avon thank you though</li>
    <li> This really does what it says. The product is very good and the price was right, far more expensive than anywhere else. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> So far I like this item that I purchased at Amazon.com.  Seems to help the puffiness under my eyes and firms the skin.</li>
    <li> good value for the money, it did tighten the area around my eyes but didn&#x27;t really do much to fix my newest wrinkle not so lovingly called chester the face molester...got rid of the bags though</li>
    <li> I believe it may be a knock off, didn&#x27;t work the same as when I purchased from a rep.</li>
    <li> I am not sure the correct product is even in the tubes now that I can see how you can open these and fill them with something else and sell them to people...makes my wonder about seller :(</li>
