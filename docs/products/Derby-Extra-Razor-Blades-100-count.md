      <li>Very cheap and efficient way to shave.  </li>
      <li>after 20 years of crappy shaving from the &amp;#34;money pit&amp;#34; razor&amp;lt;/b&gt; Excellent addition to your Ambroley Razors..perfect match, ordered the extra blades which are &amp;lt;b&gt;</li>
      <li>Love these blades..</li>
      <li>What more could you want?</li>
      <li>An enjoyable experience.</li>
      <li>My favorite blades are Shark brand.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only using a DE razor for about 6 months but out of the dozen or so blades I&#x27;ve tried, the Derby&#x27;s are the best.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they can be used more than once</li>
      <li>The packaging allows for more than one blade to be dispensed at a time.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what happened along the line since I&#x27;ve been using these, but I have been getting way too many shaving injuries for my liking</li>
      <li>Derby gives me a better shave.</li>
      <li>There are better razors blades out there than derby but for 1 time use I still save alot of money with these.</li>
      <li>these get the job done, i wouldnt use it more than two shaves...</li>
      <li>I just Love the sharpness of the blades..</li>
      <li>A friend recommended to try online for better deals.</li>
      <li>but so far so good!  </li>
      <li>for the blades, they&#x27;re pretty good.</li>
      <li>Not as close as merkur, but pretty good</li>
      <li>For how good of a value they are you can use more than one a shave and it would be still much cheeper.</li>
      <li>These are excellent razor blades manufactured in an ISO 9001-2008 certified facility in Turkey.&lt;br /&gt;The edges of the blades are coated with platinum, tungsten, chromium, ceramic and polymers just like other top quality razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>if you have a soft beard you may be happy.</li>
      <li>Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My go to blades,not to sharp just glides over my skin, perfect</li>
      <li>The sharp ones I&#x27;ve tried take perfect for and technique to avoid slicing yourself.  </li>
      <li>makes me glad charly rich is a man</li>
      <li>I love these blades, they work great in my Merkur safety razor with short handle.</li>
      <li>Nice sharp razors for a great price.</li>
      <li>Unless your an old hand with perfect technique I highly recommend these blades.  </li>
      <li>However if I was on a desert island these blades would be just fine.</li>
      <li>They cut just fine.</li>
      <li>They will work just fine for me though.</li>
      <li>I use each blade 4 times (1 per side); you could easily use each blade for longer, but I don&#x27;t bother given how cheap they are.</li>
      <li>Tried these and they work fine.</li>
      <li>just smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom shaving.</li>
      <li>They are very forgiving, yes -- and not as aggressive as say, a Feather -- but they are effective for me for a BBS shave with My EJ</li>
      <li>Comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>at $11 for 100 blades plus free shipping (Prime Member), the price at 11 cents a blade is certainly right!</li>
      <li>shaved using these blades first going along the grain with downward strokes, then went against the grain with upward strokes for most of my face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These blades are not great at all.  Used them a couple weeks ago one time and haven&#x27;t picked them up since, probably it was the tugging to my beard hair or the fact that I could only use them once, dulled out extremely quick. However, I bought the 100 pack, and they will probably collect dust in my bathroom until I decide to try them again.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT deal. These are nice everyday blades, but I only use them for two shaves max. There are sharper blades out there but I recommend these for faces not used to double blade shaving.At this price though, they are a steel! (pun intended)</li>
    <li> I like the Feathers but they can be hard to get sometimes.  These are readily available and a good second choice.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as I would think a razor should be; I didn&#x27;t expect the sharpest razor ever either for such a great price.  They will work just fine for me though.</li>
    <li> The worest blades I have use so far.  I have shaving with a safety razors for some time now. These blades cut up my face.  They are like saving with two week old Gillette razors.  One word, Rough!</li>
    <li> These are great blades and you can&#x27;t bra the price.</li>
    <li> I think blades are a personal thing.  What works for some doesn&#x27;t work for others and vice versa.  Maybe it&#x27;s the razor.  Maybe it&#x27;s the cream.  Maybe it&#x27;s the technique.  But whatever works for you, stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derby&#x27;s work for me.  I typically do a 2 pass shave every other day three times a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and usually skip the weekends.  I use an Edwin Jagger DE89l razor and Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams in various aromas just to keep things fun and interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switch to a fresh blade every Monday so I&#x27;m usually changing blades after three shaves but sometimes four if I shaved over the weekend.  If I do shave a fourth time with the same blade, I can feel it starting to dull a bit, which is why I like to stick to three and why I would never go past four.  I get a very close shave with very few nicks, scrapes or burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And at $11 for 100 blades plus free shipping (Prime Member), the price at 11 cents a blade is certainly right!</li>
    <li> They only hold their edge for 2 shaves. I have used these before and have always been able to get at least 5 shaves.</li>
    <li> Just as described, great price too!</li>
    <li> Blades are numbered on both sides which makes it easy to remember which side to turn while shaving to make the blades last longer they perform well very sharp</li>
    <li> Go with almost all DE razors</li>
    <li> Not that sharp. I prefer Merkur DE blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried a couple of different types of blades.  They are comparable to the other blades I have tried.  I get about 5 shaves / blade  The price on these was outstanding making the statement &#x27;life is too short to shave with a dull blade&#x27; hold some meaning.</li>
    <li> Good blades for a great price.</li>
    <li> and i thougt the sharks were lifechanging. world class. makes me glad charly rich is a man</li>
    <li> Nice sharp razors for a great price. This box will last me a few years.</li>
    <li> I realized these are disposable; I guess I didn&#x27;t see the label for &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; when ordered. Maybe I missed it; maybe it&#x27;s not obvious, maybe it&#x27;s not there (on the amazon description).</li>
    <li> Great for nondisposable razors--I get 3 good shaves per blade, Closest, easiest shave is with this type of blade, and all brands I&#x27;ve tried do a good job.</li>
    <li> Bought this based on the reviews, it is really dull and hurts when you shave with it. Try some other razors like permasharp super or feather. Unless you are shaving your head or legs, this dull razor will hurt.</li>
    <li> These are excellent razor blades manufactured in an ISO 9001-2008 certified facility in Turkey.&lt;br /&gt;The edges of the blades are coated with platinum, tungsten, chromium, ceramic and polymers just like other top quality razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick sand paper like hair on my face that Gillette Mach-3s and fusions wear out fast.&lt;br /&gt;I shaved using these blades first going along the grain with downward strokes, then went against the grain with upward strokes for most of my face. I passed certain problem areas in the neck and jaw line 3-4 times (at various angles like X ) resulting in a very close and smooth shave. I had one nick on a bump in my neck line. Considering how aggressive I shaved, and how that bump has always been a problem in the past, I don&#x27;t blame the blade. I love these blades, they work great in my Merkur safety razor with short handle. If you like shaving with double edge safety razors, you will love these blades as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My blades came in a retail display box as seen in the picture containing 20 plastic containers totaling 100 blades.&lt;br /&gt;Each plastic container is wrapped in a clear cellophane with easy pull tab to tear open the cellophane.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic containers have 5 blades, and each blade is wrapped in paper.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic containers have a slot on the back to store old discarded blades.</li>
    <li> You can get these for ~$1 cheaper in different packaging, but I didn&#x27;t think they came with the individual packs. I like having a way to dispose of the old blades (don&#x27;t have a blade bank) and giving them out to people to try occasionally, so it&#x27;s worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the blades, they&#x27;re pretty good. They cut as close as Merkur Supers and closer than Crystals. They cause slightly more irritation for me, but at the expense of either a crappy shave (Crystal or &amp;#34;Israelis&amp;#34;) or at 4x the cost (Merkur Supers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good price, just what I was looking for. I get about three, three pass shaves from each blade. Rarely any cuts.</li>
    <li> Best bang for your buck. I have very thick facial hair so I change the blades out every shave. Cuts through 1-2 weeks worth of growth without effort. Each little pack inside has 5 or so blades in it. You can use this small pack for convenient travel.</li>
    <li> Not the best blades.  Used 10 and went back to my Feathers.  The blades aren&#x27;t anywhere as sharp as other competitively priced blades.  They tug and don&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I purchased these blades at Christmastime and tried using them on several occasions. They seem to lack sharpness and by the second or third shave are scratchy and irritating to use. My favorite blades are Shark brand. I routinely get 10+ shaves with no loss of comfort.  I will save the Derbys for barter when SHTF ...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only using a DE razor for about 6 months but out of the dozen or so blades I&#x27;ve tried, the Derby&#x27;s are the best.  They&#x27;re forgiving but sharp and holds the edge for a while.</li>
    <li> Every couple months I experiment with going back to such blades. With my Merkur razor. But keep returning to Gillette multi blades. My beard is not very difficult. My experience has been very positive with these. I can&#x27;t speak to how long each will last, but compared to a multi-blade, which is/are so expensive, these are the way to go. They seem to cut close, without cutting my skin. I suspect I will not go back to a multi-blade. These are an excellent choice.</li>
    <li> Love these blades.. I have thick hair and sensitive skin.. Fortunately, a slow growth rate, so I usually shave every 2-3 days.. Three passes and some touching up trouble spots leave me with no skin irritation at all.. They are very forgiving, yes -- and not as aggressive as say, a Feather -- but they are effective for me for a BBS shave with My EJ DE87 attached to a Weber wave handle.  Everyone is different though -- so these reviews should be taken with a grain of salt.. For the price though, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I have been using a DE razor for quite some time now. In addition to making me feel incredibly classy whenever I go to shave, you just save SO much money on blades. Ten bucks won&#x27;t even get you a pack of these newfangled multi-blade cartridges for the Gillette Fusion Proglide or whatever fancy schmansy razor you need to sell a kidney for just to use on a somewhat regular basis. The Derby Extra blades were always pretty good to me but as of recently I may switch brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Derby Extra blades are known for being a pretty forgiving blade for the new double edged shaver. They aren&#x27;t as sharp as their competitors and have a polymer coating which reduces irritation and improves razor glide. For the longest time I was getting a great shave with these until I got halfway into the pack; then things took a turn for the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was cutting myself left and right with these blades but my technique hadn&#x27;t changed. In fact, just two days ago I went to shave my chin and the blade nearly hacked a small chunk of skin off; I hadn&#x27;t bled so much from a shaving cut in a long time. I am thinking this could be from a few factors. First, who knows maybe my technique got sloppy and I just hadn&#x27;t corrected it. Second, I have really, really tough facial hair. I don&#x27;t have a lot, but it&#x27;s tough so perhaps I just need a sharper blade and the tug and friction is what&#x27;s causing this. Third, and I hope it&#x27;s not this but I do wonder, maybe the pack I got just wasn&#x27;t made well. I had even gotten cuts with a brand new blade and that generally doesn&#x27;t happen with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall these blades really did shave wonderfully for a while and deserve better than three stars but I can&#x27;t rate them too, too highly now because they might just not be the blade for me or some of them in the pack just weren&#x27;t grinded down right or something along those lines. I don&#x27;t know what happened along the line since I&#x27;ve been using these, but I have been getting way too many shaving injuries for my liking so I may have to try something else. Which is a shame because I wanted to keep using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, don&#x27;t let my review deter you from trying these blades. If you don&#x27;t have a ton of facial hair, or thin facial hair or even sensitive skin the Derby Extras are a great buy. They are much less harsh than sharper blades but don&#x27;t let that be a reason to get sloppy on technique like I may have. Again, it could be me but it might not have. I will keep onto the rest of the pack I have and really take it slow the next few shaves and see if it makes a difference.r my liking so I may have to try something else. Which is a shame because I wanted to keep using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, don&#x27;t let my review deter you from trying these blades.

I will keep onto the rest of the pack I have and really take it slow the next few shaves and see if it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Finally a blade that works in the morning and is not too aggressive.  I am not cutting myself and getting an excellent shave.  I have initially given other blades a positive review, but the Derby blades are the only ones that have not resulted in poor performance via cuts and over aggressiveness over time.  I use an Edwin Jagger DE89 which works very well with them.</li>
    <li> Double edge razor blades have quietly disappeared from store shelves. They have been replaced by disposables; 2 blades; 3 blades; 4 blades; and even 5 blades for closer shave. Nice try, but none of them comes closed, save more and less waste.</li>
    <li> I have used several other blades in the past. These seem to match my skin the best. Some blades were too sharp for me such as feather and others not sharp enough. In my opinion there is no perfect blade for everyone, everyone is different.</li>
    <li> These blades are the best for me! The reason I like these over other blades is...1) A clean close shave 2) I can use a single blade for two to three shaves and 3) lower cost. I was using the FeatherLite blades, but thought I should try others. I have coarse facial hair. I never got two shaves out of the Featherlites. One close shave, that was it. I was even considering going back to the Schick triple edge blade that I could use for over a week. I am so pleased with the Derby Extra Blades! The price is far better also. Derby Extra is $10.95 for 100 and FeatherLites are $14.95 for 50. I found my blade and it&#x27;s Derby Extra!!</li>
    <li> these blades are the best blades you will ever use. ever since i have been using these blades i do not mind shaving any more &amp; the best thing about them is they are sharper than the blades i got at the store! but do not take my word for it git some &amp; use them you will love them!!</li>
    <li> These are sharp without being too aggressive and the price is just right. I will recommend to others and buy again myself.</li>
    <li> Price wise it can not be beat...performance to be honest I still do not know</li>
    <li> Recently bought a Merkur long handle safety razor; I also bought Derby razors. I have used both the Derby razors and the Merkur blade that came with the razor. For Derby&#x27;s price, I would say it was a very good buy and Im happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Blades are good but not great</li>
    <li> For the past three years, I&#x27;ve only used Derby and Feathers. Derby gives me a better shave. Feather blades are too aggressive; you must take extra cautions not to cut yourself during shaving. For that reason, I&#x27;ll continue using Derby, plus the price is excellent. Keep up the good work guys. What works for me, may not work for someone else. You may have to make a decision based on your shaving style and your type of beard.</li>
    <li> I had about given up on switching to this kind of shave because of poor performance from other blades.But a friend gave one these blades and after using it,I was hooked on these.I am able to use these at least four times without a nick or cut.I highly recommend these.I use these with the Merkur 30C,it&#x27;s a really good feeling razor,and the heft makes it easy to use.</li>
    <li> Tore my face up.  Looked like I was in a knife fight and everybody had a knife but me.</li>
    <li> SHAVED WELL. DELIVERED ON TIME.</li>
    <li> These Razors are great for the price.  Very cheap and efficient way to shave.  There is no need to purchase the expensive 4 blade razors when these do the same thing for less money.  There are better razors blades out there than derby but for 1 time use I still save alot of money with these.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as other blades, which makes Derby great for those with sensitive skin! This also makes them great for beginner DE shavers.&lt;br /&gt;You may need to do an extra pass, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> True to it&#x27;s word. A trusted seller</li>
    <li> I have reordered these for the third time.  I have tried many other brands of razors, and yes there are some that are very well made and durable, they are still not worth the price that you save with these guys.  For how good of a value they are you can use more than one a shave and it would be still much cheeper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Feather blades for years. Tried these and they work fine. Sharp &amp; smooth. No new nicks or scratches.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m probably not supposed to name names, however I like these over Merkur and BIC.</li>
    <li> So far these blades seem to be my favorite. I have tried sharks and gillette blue&#x27;s they are also priced good</li>
    <li> Good quality and dirt cheap. What more could you want?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to the safety razor thing but so far so good!  The Derby blades are dirt cheap and they are better than any other blades I&#x27;ve tried so far.  They are very comfortable and glide along the skin with no irritation or &amp;#34;tugging&amp;#34;.  I have tried some that are sharper but at the expense of comfort. The sharp ones I&#x27;ve tried take perfect for and technique to avoid slicing yourself.  The only real drawback I can think of is that as some have mentioned the used blade holder on the blade case doesn&#x27;t hold the used blades as tightly or securely as the other razor blade brands I&#x27;ve tried.  Unless your an old hand with perfect technique I highly recommend these blades.  Thats my 2 cents, remember that everybody&#x27;s skin is different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My quick recap of the blades I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Israeli Personna - Very sharp, very aggressive to my skin, took practice to get a decent shave with these.  Not for me!&lt;br /&gt;Merkur - Decent middle of the road blade, more tug then others, not too sharp but not too dull.  Not worth the high prices I&#x27;ve seen&lt;br /&gt;Wilkinson - This is a solid blade that is almost as good as the Derby Extras but not as comfortable or forgiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the following blades and here&#x27;s my take.&lt;br /&gt;Israeli</li>
    <li> I use these along with the Edwin Jagger old school razor thingy, so far so good however they are numbered 1,2 and then you flip it over it says 3,4. Not exactly sure which side goes on which when placing it on the razor. I need to research this.  Now my skin is boogey. I&#x27;m sure they can be used more than once but I only use once and then I discard them.  I don&#x27;t like bacteria, dark spots, bumps, ingrown hairs etc on my face</li>
    <li> Good product. As advertised.</li>
    <li> Great razor for first time shavers!</li>
    <li> Okay, simple review: 100 razors for like $15. I shave 2-3 times a week, means I switch out a razor every week. This pack will last me nearly two years at that rate. And the blades? They cut just fine. Not too sharp, not dull at all. Nice, smooth shave, low resistance. Value and quality. Simple as that.</li>
    <li> I have a rather thick beard and these don&#x27;t quite &#x27;cut&#x27; it, no pun intended. If you&#x27;re looking for something on the sharper side these aren&#x27;t it. However they are forgiving on the skin, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> Keep an edge well and aren&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m able to shave with these blades without cutting myself several times a week.Feather blades are too sharp for me with less than a year of wet shaving experience, but these Derbys let me enjoy my shave without wounding myself.  Try them, you&#x27;ll like them.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described. Great value, you&#x27;re basically getting 100 safety blades for the price of one cartridge razor set, and they shave a lot smoother with less irritation. I use each blade 4 times (1 per side); you could easily use each blade for longer, but I don&#x27;t bother given how cheap they are. Consistently switching out blades gives me a sharp, irritation-free shave, and you can prolong the quality of the blade between uses by properly drying the blade and/or keeping it submerged in mineral oil!</li>
    <li> Work great and arrived on time</li>
    <li> &amp;lt;b&gt;Happy Days are here again ! after 20 years of crappy shaving from the &amp;#34;money pit&amp;#34; razor&amp;lt;/b&gt; Excellent addition to your Ambroley Razors..perfect match, ordered the extra blades which are &amp;lt;b&gt;MADE IN TURKEY&amp;lt;/b&gt;, well Turkish are know for the best &amp;#34;Turkish Batch and Salon, it shows in when you shave with these blades.</li>
    <li> Came just as pictured 20 packs of 5 razors.</li>
    <li> I think they are the sharpest. Just my opinion</li>
    <li> used feathers for 3 years... got a close shave, but usually too close.. major irritation sometimes, other times none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used the derby twice and already i feel the smoother shave and less irritation. Some ppl say that they can use the feathers for more shaves before changing the blade, big deal. just change the blade every time or every other time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that said, it really depends on your face. buy a sample pack and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> There is no reason to buy those rip off 5 blade razors.  These are just as good if not better.</li>
    <li> Not as close as merkur, but pretty good</li>
    <li> not sharp at all maybe get to shaves out of one razor. But good price.</li>
    <li> As everyone else says, which blade you use is completely about matching the right blade to your face and DE razor. For me Derbys have always been the only blade that can get every last bit of stubble for a perfect shave. It&#x27;s nice having this 100 pack come in packs of 5 so I can hide the larger portion while working through a single pack. Great blades and consistently good quality.</li>
    <li> I got what I needed. All the blades work so far and I have no complaints thus far either. it was a great buy.</li>
    <li> I tried several blades when I got my safety razor.  I was glad these worked best for me as you can get them at a great price and large quantity.  I only get 2 (two pass) shavings out of each blade.  My skin gets a little irritated if I go any more.  At this price I don&#x27;t even chance it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that my used blades sometimes escape the compartment on the back.</li>
    <li> I have used these now for a month. I have a pretty highly rated razor, but with these blades I really have to work at a close shave, which leads to many cuts.</li>
    <li> these are great the best razor blades ever thanks.My go to blades,not to sharp just glides over my skin, perfect</li>
    <li> My husband and his sons loves these blades. They don&#x27;t dull as quickly and they provide a clean close shave. They are great blades the price .</li>
    <li> Very good quality blades.  Never a razor burn.</li>
    <li> These provide 4 shaves per blade before I like to change them. Sometimes two shaves is all I&#x27;ll do, because at this price, it won&#x27;t break the bank. I&#x27;ve only used Derby Extra blades, so I have no comparison, but I am completely satisfied with how well they work. This pack will probably last me 2 years or more.</li>
    <li> I started shaving my face and head with a safety razor about a month ago and love how easy it is, as oppose to other ways of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The time came to buy new blades and the stores charge $2 for 5 count blades,  &amp;#34; Hell No&amp;#34;. A friend recommended to try online for better deals. i found it with Derby blades, a 100 count blades for just ten dollars! it was a good deal and good quality blades.</li>
    <li> My husband is super picky when it comes to his razors and straight blades.  He has tried many brands and absolutely loves these, but cautions a shaver to be careful because these are sharper than the typical straight blade</li>
    <li> Great product. Comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Great blades at a great price. I use for 3 shaves and then dispose. I&#x27;m new to safety razor shaving but after trying a few blades, Derby works well for my face.</li>
    <li> Good blades, way sharper than other derby blades I have bought from other vendors on Amazon.</li>
    <li> this was a gift but he really likes them</li>
    <li> A good blade, well purchase again</li>
    <li> razor blades are a personal thing. some blades suit you some dont. these get the job done, i wouldnt use it more than two shaves...i notice i require more smoothing cream (compared to when using other blades) to get these blades to shave without cutting myself</li>
    <li> these blades are very nice. get a very close shave with only 3 passes. no nicks, no cuts. just smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom shaving. best of all, they&#x27;re cheap!</li>
    <li> I actually received a five pack with the razor I bought. It came with one Merkur and five Derby&#x27;s. It took a month to eventually use the Merkur and it was still good when I replaced it just to try these critters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell much difference. However I had to remember in what position I placed the Merkur in the razor. The Derby has numbers on each corner of each side of the blade to help me remember how it is placed in the razor. The packaging allows for more than one blade to be dispensed at a time. I save the original wrapping for disposal as I have curious cats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I am not sensitive enough to tell a difference in the blades. I can tell without a doubt that double edge safety blades outperform cartridges. It looks like it is going to be about a while before I can really compare blades so I bought some other brands based on recommendations.  However if I was on a desert island these blades would be just fine.</li>
    <li> This pack of 100 count Derby razor is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Not sharp enough for me; too much pulling and not enough cutting. For those who have finer facial hair, these blades are probably a good buy.</li>
    <li> I just Love the sharpness of the blades..</li>
    <li> Very nice shave. It&#x27;s clean and close. No bumps. An enjoyable experience. Other blades do not compare. Very very good.</li>
    <li> Great beginner razors. I haven&#x27;t been wet shaving with a double edged blade very long but these minimize cuts while getting the team technique down.</li>
    <li> Wonderful deal, the blades cut excellent</li>
    <li> Inexpensive.  I use these blades when using my lame to score French bread--I use one blade for four loaves, turning the blade after each loaf.</li>
    <li> I tried feathers before, and they would cut up my face if I wasn&#x27;t careful. Derby razors are not quite as sharp, but still did a great job giving my face a close shave. Limited nicks. Great for my sensitive skin. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> These blades are the best. Sharp and very affordable.  Better than the more popular mach razors</li>
    <li> Good razors for 10$ but nothing special.</li>
    <li> These blades work but I am unimpressed. They cut me more often than my old, similarly priced ones. They are completely inferior to Feather brand blades. My beard is made of steel wire, stone, and testosterone, though, so if you have a soft beard you may be happy.</li>
    <li> These are my go to blades for double edge shaving. Sharp and smooth but forgiving. I can get between 3 to 4 excellent shaves with each blade.</li>
    <li> 100 blades. They&#x27;re sharp. They work. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Outstanding blades for someone with relatively sensitive skin. Not abrasive and no pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say you should get 6-7 shaves out of each blade if you have moderately thick facial hair.  Certainly worth the price.</li>
    <li> derby makes great blades.</li>
    <li> Sharp and effective, though I wish there was better packaging.  You need some steady hands to unwrap the blades.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed by these. Gave me the worst shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Astra SS or SP works great for me though.</li>
    <li> I would give this less than one star if possible. This has to be the biggest pos i have ever bought doesn&#x27;t even get close to a nice shave Nvr buying these again Damn hair clippers get a closer shave. Save Ur money on these n buy normal razors</li>
    <li> Best blades ive ever used... Other ones tend to cut me..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is crazy good.</li>
