<li> Fit a bit tight and not certain if it actually helped my sea sickness.</li>
<li> These claim to be adult, and maybe they&#x27;re intended to be snug, but they were uncomfortably tight on my wrists.</li>
<li> I purchased these wristbands after years of problems with motion sickness on long car trips and flights.  </li>
<li> They are pretty tight, and I have small wrists, but they need to be snug to work.</li>
<li> Results may vary for other people.</li>
<li> 4 hour flight, 8.5 hours on a rickety bus in a foreign country and no motion sickness.  </li>
<li> Got these for my cruise, and never hot a hint of nausea..</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if they actually helped my nausea (morning sickness) at all, except in that I was distracted by the discomfort of wearing these.</li>
<li> Getting off anti depressants can be brutal if you are on a high dose and wean off quickly.  </li>
<li> the only thing that even remotely helped was GINGERAILE, just drink the crap out of it and unless your also hungover you should be cool.</li>
<li> I will actually use these in a few weeks when going on a Danube Rivre Cruise but have had them in the past so that is why I re-ordered them.</li>
<li> i don&#x27;t use yet because i buy to late in the end of the summer, , , , , , , , , , i hope use in the next summer to coming soon</li>
<li> I take Zofran (not pregnant) but this helps me limit the need for medicine.</li>
<li> i put these on and started to enjoy myself, but as soon as the ship got out to sea and started rocking i fealt HORRIBLE for 3 days there and three days back, they SUCKED!!  </li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t find them to work at all even though I kept them on for a few hours.</li>
<li> Acupressure has been around forever and the Sea Band Wristbands work on this principle - I&#x27;m not sure why pressure on the wrists helps with nausea associated with traveling.....</li>
<li> She&#x27;s pregnant and so sick!  </li>
<li> I have always gotten sea sick on boats in the past but recently tried Sea Bands.  </li>
<li> Very rough ship + very bad life long motion sickness sufferer + sea</li>
<li> They are useless (in my case)</li>
<li> I was very nauseated for about 3 weeks</li>
<li> my wife and I both bought a pair of these to go on a cruise just in case we got sea sick.  </li>
<li> I wore these on a flight and on a cruise and didn&#x27;t get at all sick.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m guessing it worked, as I couldn&#x27;t travel even for an hour by boat or shop without getting sick</li>
<li> Went on a cruise and got sick once after dinner.</li>
<li> I have very bad vertigo.  </li>

    <li> I ordered these wristbands after reading that they would be helpful in helping me to go back to sleep should I awakened during the night.  AND THEY DO JUST THAT MUCH TO MY SURPRISE.  They also work for seasickness and morning sickness so I&#x27;v read. I always like a product that does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for me, but cause me pain in my wrists. Better luck to anyone who dares try them!</li>
    <li> Got a couple for my Granddaughter-in-law. She&#x27;s pregnant and so sick!  I&#x27;ve used them myself and have &amp;#34;gifted&amp;#34; them to friends with cancer, pregnant and those going on cruises.</li>
    <li> I have very bad vertigo.  I bought my first pair of these in Hong Kong in 1996 to go on a boat ride in the harbor.  I just had to replace them in 2010 so they obviously hold up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them for boat rides mostly.  They seem to work.  I just follow the directions that come with the bands.  I sometimes wonder if it is in my head that they work, but I figure if I believe that they work, then they must work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy them. Try them. If you don&#x27;t like them, you aren&#x27;t out that much $$$.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t use yet because i buy to late in the end of the summer, , , , , , , , , , i hope use in the next summer to coming soon</li>
    <li> I will actually use these in a few weeks when going on a Danube Rivre Cruise but have had them in the past so that is why I re-ordered them.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and I have referred other people to it. I bought these for myself and my son for our vacation and we both used them everday. They work amazing!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this thing works or not, but I wore it constantly on my cruise. It allowed me to avoid drugs. Got mine in black and it looked okay.</li>
    <li> Acupressure has been around forever and the Sea Band Wristbands work on this principle - I&#x27;m not sure why pressure on the wrists helps with nausea associated with traveling.....but it does and I wouldn&#x27;t travel by train, plane or boat without them.  I suppose you could take anti-nausea drugs (which tend to make  you incredibly sleepy) but why do that when these work without any side effects?  Just remember to actually take the time to read the directions and place them on your wrists correctly.</li>
    <li> I have always gotten sea sick on boats in the past but recently tried Sea Bands.  They worked wonders!  I felt fine the entire boat ride even while drinking alcohol.  I will need board a boat without them!</li>
    <li> Worked very well. No sea sickness</li>
    <li> my wife and I both bought a pair of these to go on a cruise just in case we got sea sick.  i put these on and started to enjoy myself, but as soon as the ship got out to sea and started rocking i fealt HORRIBLE for 3 days there and three days back, they SUCKED!!  the only thing that even remotely helped was GINGERAILE, just drink the crap out of it and unless your also hungover you should be cool.</li>
    <li> We just rreturned from a 7 day cruise on the Pride of America and these bands worked exactly as described. We tried to build up our tolerance for sailing by not wearing them until we needed them but as soon as the headache started to set it we put the bands on. In a matter of minutes the headache would vanish and any symptoms of motion sickness was gone. This worked for both my wife and I.</li>
    <li> Got these for my cruise, and never hot a hint of nausea..I&#x27;m guessing it worked, as I couldn&#x27;t travel even for an hour by boat or shop without getting sick</li>
    <li> Used for cruise and for some dizziness associated with ear infections.  Worked for both.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful after reading all the reviews and made sure to follow the directions exactly. I didn&#x27;t find them to work at all even though I kept them on for a few hours. Some people swear by them though. Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work that great for morning sickness.</li>
    <li> It made no difference on my wife</li>
    <li> 4 hour flight, 8.5 hours on a rickety bus in a foreign country and no motion sickness.  For this trip the bands definitely worked.</li>
    <li> Very rough ship + very bad life long motion sickness sufferer + sea band+ sea band ginger gum &#x3D;  best vacation of my life.</li>
    <li> They work!! We have used them for morning sickness, motion sickness and even on a cruise.  My daughter uses them each time we are in the car.  I&#x27;m so glad to have a non-medication remedy for her motion sickness.</li>
    <li> These claim to be adult, and maybe they&#x27;re intended to be snug, but they were uncomfortably tight on my wrists. I&#x27;m not sure if they actually helped my nausea (morning sickness) at all, except in that I was distracted by the discomfort of wearing these. I would not recommend them.</li>
    <li> When it works, it is awesome.  A great alternative to prescription anti nausea meds.  These bands were a life saver while weaning off anti depressant meds.  Getting off anti depressants can be brutal if you are on a high dose and wean off quickly.  I was very nauseated for about 3 weeks and these bands were a tremendous help with nausea and dizziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also work great for motion sickness &amp; dizziness as long as I put them on BEFORE I embark a mode of transportation.  They are useless (in my case) if I try to curb nausea after it sets in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bands do NOT work for migraine nausea.</li>
    <li> Worked great! Will be ordering more and wearing on all trips I take in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this for insomnia purposes. Sometimes the bands work sometimes they don&#x27;t. Studies show that the bands were used for sleep problems as well as motion sickness. Results may vary for other people.</li>
    <li> The one and only. Sea Band is a trusted name that has been around for decades. The original and the best. ... DRUG FREE!!!!!</li>
    <li> Went on a cruise and got sick once after dinner. Put the wrist band on and felt better right away. Wish came in different colors, felt like I was in the 80&#x27;s</li>
    <li> This work great! I take Zofran (not pregnant) but this helps me limit the need for medicine. I get nausea and vertigo from pain from fibromyalgia in my shoulders and neck. These help so much. I often forget I have them on.</li>
    <li> Fit a bit tight and not certain if it actually helped my sea sickness.</li>
    <li> I purchased these wristbands after years of problems with motion sickness on long car trips and flights.  These are very comfortable, easy to conceal, and worked wonders to alleviate the nausea and discomfort of my motion sickness.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I wore these on a flight and on a cruise and didn&#x27;t get at all sick. It was a pretty smooth cruise, but I was glad to have these just in case. They are pretty tight, and I have small wrists, but they need to be snug to work.</li>
    <li> The Sea Bands work for both flying and have used them on a vessel during a Whale Watch.  The Sea Bands work very well, just as advertised.  Would Highly Recommend.</li>
