    <li> How is it that I click on NiteWhite and think I&#x27;m purchasing, NiteWhite and ZOOM arrives at my door instead? What is happening? If Dental Discus has discontinued their original brand, NightWhite, then this new company should as least take the old photos off of Amazon. And, I&#x27;m almost sure they&#x27;ve changed the formula.</li>
    <li> I used this kit about a year after having used the same product as supplied by my dentist. Although the syringes supplied with this kit looked identical to the ones supplied by my dentist, there was no whitening effect on my teeth after 9 nights of usage. In contrast, with the kit bought from my dentist I could see an effect within 3 nights of usage. This time the only effect on my teeth was immense sensitivity and pain (which I didnt feel with the kit form my dentist).   So unless something happened to my teeth which does not allow them to whiten anymore (which I seriously doubt) this product is not genuine. I also bought the 22% kit from the same seller for my mother and it didnt work for her neither. I am very disappointed as the price of the kit here was 3 times cheaper. Amazon should do something about the sellers allowing to do business through its site. I am going to stick with only buying books and dvds form amazon from now on. Beware!</li>
    <li> I recently had my teeth bleached through my dentist at the tune of $200.+ so my hubby wanted his done when he saw my results. I found this available online and decided to try and see if we could save some money....WOW, did we!! His smile is getting whiter every day and he is looking hott! He is very happy and smiling a lot more! I have seen some people say it doesn&#x27;t work but that has not been our experience and our two adult daughters are going to do theirs now too! If there is a downside, it would only be that you have to use more product do the fact the trays are not fitted like the ones the Dr. makes for you but it&#x27;s still a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love this whitening gel, which leaves my teeth beautifully, sparkling white!  I paid approximately $35 for the same three-pack item from my dentists, so was thrilled to find the same item for sale on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I used this product with my Invisalign and I normally don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth but after using a small amount overnight, the next day my teeth were ridiculously sensitive.  I even got a sharp pain once randomly throughout the day.  It felt like my teeth were all icicles.  The second day after, however, everything was back to normal.</li>
    <li> I ordered Nitewhite and received a zoom product.  I have always used nitewhite and loved it.  This zoom product does not&lt;br /&gt;work.  I have used one syringe and see no difference in my teeth.  Nitewhite was excellent.  I will be returning this product.</li>
    <li> This is the only concentration that I ever tried and I like using it in the night. It does not bother me, the teeth are not achy in the morning, nice whitening.</li>
    <li> The bleaching gel was easy to use, fast and effective with no residual teeth sensitivity. Would gladly recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> Have used this before and it works. Originally I received it from my dentist along with the mouth inserts he made fit to my teeth.</li>
    <li> This is the same stuff my Dentist uses at more than 1/2 the price.  It does a good whitening for me.</li>
    <li> I used  this product a year ago or so from my dentist at a considerably higher cost.  Perfect to use occasionally just to brighten my teeth up again. It does cause some sensitivity, but I had the same issue with it when I originally used it.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Used to purchase it from the dentist but this is the same product and is cheaper than buying it from the dentist.</li>
    <li> I think perhaps the stuff they put into this so as not to cause sensitivity has diminished the effect of the whitening process.  It&#x27;s sad when they change something that works so well.</li>
    <li> Works just as good as the gel I get thru my dentist&#x27;s office only A LOT cheaper! Very pleased with product</li>
    <li> After using Nite White Bleaching Gel and the other Nite white product, not much&lt;br /&gt;improvement. I dont find that it works well at all. I wouldnt want to buy this any more. Would rather have a refund and purchase a Bleaching gel from some other company that actually works.</li>
    <li> This is the exact whitening gel my dentist sells for $30. I&#x27;ve used it for years and I love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is as good as what I buy from my dentist.  It did whiten my teeth but took longer.  Maybe it is a different strength from my dentist&#x27;s brand.</li>
    <li> This product is safe enough to fall asleep with and not burn your gums in the morning. It is all that is needed for maintaining your white teeth.</li>
    <li> Yes.  I use It in a sleeping tray.  22 is not recommended for overnight use.  It definitely helps with the coffee stains.</li>
    <li> I find this to be very good. It does whiten your teeth (people notice, and I&#x27;m not a smoker and don&#x27;t have dark teeth to start with..). But you can expect sensitivity increase.</li>
    <li> The product was very good. I liked that it worked as well as the sample I received from the dentist</li>
