      <li>So, I tried the Orchid Oil version and, it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
      <li>It was a lot of product for an amazing price!  </li>
      <li>Non greasy and a good lotion</li>
      <li>It does a good job moisturizing, too.</li>
      <li>Loved this product.</li>
      <li>but honestly I prefer the marigold oil lotion.</li>
      <li>The scent is one that most will find pleasing</li>
      <li>It is not greasy and I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
      <li>I gave a bottle of this lotion to my mother-in-law four years ago for Christmas and it has become her favorite.</li>
      <li>Discovered this product about 5 years ago and love it.  </li>
      <li>It is fantastic!  </li>

      <li>I love Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Moisturizing Lotion for its non-greasy, effective, quick moisturizing properties.</li>
      <li>The orchid oil is perfect for me -  Non greasy, soaks in quickly and leaves skin soft and protected for hours.</li>
      <li>But it still works great on my very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My favorite body lotion--fast absorbing and effective with a nice, light scent.  </li>
      <li>It keeps your skin smooth and healthy.</li>
      <li>This really does smell good &amp; the scent isn&#x27;t strong either.</li>

      <li>Used to buy the 32 oz twin pack, but evidently Amazon doesn&#x27;t offer it any more.</li>
      <li>I still prefer the clean, soap-like scent of the original, but...</li>
      <li>The lotion is smooth going on and absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>I find this scent too sweet.</li>
      <li>Is  so very mosturazing cream and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky,  I just love it</li>
      <li>We used this for many month; however, it is becoming harder to find or is increasing in cost so were are looking for alternatives that work as well.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, love that it sinks right in and does not leave a greasy residue, yet it leaves the skin feeling soft.</li>
      <li>Better yet, the price is a couple of dollars cheaper than at my local store.</li>
      <li>This lotion is pure luxury.  </li>
      <li>I really really recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>

      <li>I was unable to find it locally, but was glad to see it and the accompanying bar soap available through Amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very dry skin and after using this lotion for only a couple of days, my skin was noticeably hydrated and much smoother.  </li>

    <li> Love the smell, love that it sinks right in and does not leave a greasy residue, yet it leaves the skin feeling soft. Better yet, the price is a couple of dollars cheaper than at my local store. I wonder, does it come in gallon size?</li>
    <li> Non greasy and a good lotion..  I will buy this again.  The scent is one that most will find pleasing</li>
    <li> I used to get this product locally and started having trouble finding it. For the last few years I have bought this on Amazon for myself and my wife. As a moisturizer I see absolutely no reason to buy anything else. Even my kids use it when they get dry skin and I have some picky kids!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve experienced better goat milk products, this one is decent though. I&#x27;d had to add alittle johoba oil for a smoother application.</li>

    <li> This lotion is pure luxury.  It has a fresh subtle fragrance, goes on smoothly, and does not leave a greasy feeling.  I only gave it 4 stars because it did not keep my skin moisturized as long as I had hoped.  It is worth the effort to reapply more often.</li>
    <li> Loved this product. It is not greasy and I love how it feels on my skin. I bought the 3 pack and one bottle do last quite a long time. I will keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered the orchid oil but honestly I prefer the marigold oil lotion. I find this scent too sweet. But it still works great on my very sensitive skin. It is rich yet does not clog my pores.</li>

    <li> Canus is a wonderful product, I ran out of the lotion&lt;br /&gt;and nothing- I mean nothing works like canus. It keeps your skin smooth and healthy. This must have staple for every day use.</li>
    <li> On a whitewater float trip this past summer, a fellow boater recommended this product to combat dry skin.  I was unable to find it locally, but was glad to see it and the accompanying bar soap available through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is great.  It is not greasy and the fragrance is light, not obtrusive.  I actually get compliments when exchanging hugs.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a product for daily use to combat dry skin.</li>
