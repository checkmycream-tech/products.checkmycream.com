<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The Yalmeh Foundation Brush is a great quality brush that makes a great gift too! Not only is this brush affordable but it also feels amazingly smooth to the touch. As for this holiday season my mom was defiantly in need of a new foundation brush &amp; the Yalmeh Foundation Brush met her requirements. Plus it looks great on the bathroom counter!</li>
    <li> •★ HIGHEST QUALITY MATERIALS : Created From Top Grade Synthetic Fiber Materials For Long Lasting Use.Higher Quality Fibers Prevent Shedding for as long as you own the brush. Hypoallergenic, Cruelty Free, Vegan Friendly.&lt;br /&gt;••★ LIKE TO KNOW MORE: NO Shedding, Easy Clean Up With No Smell,High Quality Hand Made With Wood Handles. Best Gift for Friend. • The Perfect Brush Even on the go-Yalmeh Y19 is Great for Setting, Bronzing and Applying Blush. Liquid Foundation Brush, Powder Foundation Brush. Foundation Blending Brush,Foundation Makeup Brush. Do Not Let Another day in The Mirror Pass Without Yalmeh Foundation Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foundation brush is great for applying makeup, especially around the eyes and nose area. I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality of the bristles for the price. Bristles are very soft and full and the brush is easy to clean. After a few washings the bristles are still in tact and none have fallen out. I was skeptical at first but now that I&#x27;ve seen the quality I want to purchase other Yalmeh brushes.</li>
    <li> Yalmeh is a brand that I trust and adore. I personally have tried quite a lot of their products and I am never ever disappointed with the results that I get. I am in love with their face serums and eye creams…and this foundation brush just made me love this brand even more! This foundation brush is well made and dense – and it works so much better than other name brands that I have used in the past! The density and design of this foundation brush allows you to evenly distribute your foundation – nothing goes to waste! I love the finish I get when I use it! Yalmeh…you did it again! You just made me fall in love with your brand even more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for consumers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing foundation brush by YALMEH. I love how soft the bristles are and how sturdy it is. It has a lovely, white pearl wooden handle with gold metal on it. It looks so elegant and pretty. There was no weird smell when I first got it. I washed it first before using it and had no shedding whatsoever. I could tell that it&#x27;s a high-quality make-up brush because it is hand made. I used it for my BB Cream which made me have perfect application, with no streaking at all. It&#x27;s so soft that foundation applies smoothly without any irritation or tugging on the skin. I like that this brush is multi-purpose. You can use it for your cream or powder blushes. My favorite way to use it that works wonderfully are for contouring and bronzing the face. This is now my everyday make-up brush and I totally recommend it to any lady who is looking for a high-quality foundation brush. Also a great gift for a friend this Christmas time.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for a mousse foundation and it works well! I have 2 Sigma flat kabuki brushes that I&#x27;ve been using as a foundation brush and I&#x27;d say this works either just as well or better. And its cheaper, so win win!! Well made and definently worth the price. Seriously considering buying the brush set!</li>
    <li> Great brush. Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love mineral make up and the coverage it provides. I recently learned that the brush make a big difference in how well your make up covers and applies. I recieved this foundation brush to try for my review and was pleasantly surprised at how well it improved my foundation coverage. It actually works the foundation in rather than sitting it on top of your face. I love the angle of the brush as I can get around my eyes, mouth, nose and all over application. One brush to do it all! That&#x27;s wonderful! The brush was extremely soft and I did not have any trouble with the bristles falling out or shedding. It fits comfortably in my hand for proper use as well. This is definitely a great brush and the durabilityis astounding. Clean up was a breeze and again, no trouble with bristles falling out or shedding after cleaning. It&#x27;s a high end brush for a great price! Perfect gift idea too!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:d86a68e37e1fa41c7c1147d476bbc074]] I really love the Yalmeh Peerless Beauty Foundation Brush especially for contouring, and applying concealer under my eyes. The bristles are so soft, and it feels amazing against your skin. I also love the design of it I think it looks luxurious since the handles have a pearlescent finish, and gold trimming. The Yalmeh Peerless Beauty Foundation Brush is easy to grip, and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that there is no shedding, with other brushes I would have to stop applying my makeup just to pick off any fall out from the bristles. The Yalmeh Foundation Brush is well made, and I think you are going to love it plus it&#x27;s affordable and won&#x27;t break the bank unlike similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think the Yalmeh Peerless Beauty Foundation Brush is a great foundation brush for every day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  I received these products for free to review . The opinions in my review are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> I had never used a foundation brush before so I can&#x27;t really compare it to other brushes, but when I received this to review I was excited to try a new beauty tool. I am definitely pleased with this one -- the bristles are just the right, not too soft or too hard. They blend foundation or CC Cream perfectly. I&#x27;m pretty sure that I&#x27;ll continue using a brush for my foundation going forward and the price on this one is definitely right!</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try a foundation brush in this shape, so I was excited to put this one through its paces. The brush features a wide, circular ferrule in gold. The handle is thick and made of wood, with an angled end. The brush is a great size and feels very sturdy in my hands. The ends of the brush are tapered into an almost cone-like shape. The bristles are very soft. I&#x27;ve washed and used this a couple of times; I&#x27;ve had no issues with shedding. The bristles are dense, so it provides a nice, even coverage when applying foundation or concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like using this brush for liquid foundation, but my favorite application has been applying cream concealer beneath my eyes. *Product was provided by the company to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> When I found this foundation brush online, I knew I had to try it. I have never seen such a foundation brush like this before. Ever foundation brush I have used is either thin, thick and always round. The shape of this brush, being chiseled as it is made, just made sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman&#x27;s cheeks just need a chisel edged foundation brush. Just look at how this brush is made in this photo below. When I began using this brush, and as I saw how evenly, and nicely, my foundation, and blush, moved across my cheeks in an even manner, I knew this was the brush for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has been made with top Grade Synthetic Materials. These synthetic fiber materials allow  for a longer lasting usage. This brush is also hypoallergenic, cruelty free, vegan friendly and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean. Oh, and this foundation brush makes for an excellent gift for family and friends.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness!  I can&#x27;t get enough of this foundation brush!  My Yalmeh Foundation Brush arrived super quick, it was packaged very nicely and has a beautiful chic look to it.&lt;br /&gt;I immediately took the brush and rubbed it on the top of my hand and cheeks.  I love the feel of the brush.  It’s so soft and feels like a very high quality brush.  My daughter has a Mac foundation brush and we both felt that this Yalmeh Foundation Brush is of just of good of quality if not better.&lt;br /&gt;I applied my powder foundation and just loved the flawless look.  The brush blended the foundation very nicely into my skin.  I also, experimented with a liquid foundation and loved the way it blended with no clumping and no heavy look left after applying.&lt;br /&gt;I found this Yalmeh Foundation Brush to work perfectly, there were no straddle bristles left on my face like you will find with cheaper brushes.  This brush cleans very well and you don’t have to worry about it falling apart, it’s made to last while being gentle on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will be definitely getting more of these brushes and now my daughters want to give up their high-priced mall brushes for this amazing one for a fraction of the cost.  I can’t wait to see what other brush Yalmeh Peerless Beauty has, I know they will be just as wonderful as this one.  I received this product at no charge, I am leaving me this review with my honest opinion only!</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to test out this product in exchange for a review. All opinions expressed are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;t&#x27;s not often that I purchase things specifically for the purpose of pampering myself but every once in a while it&#x27;s good to take care of you! Over the past year I&#x27;ve done a bit of splurging on new makeup, but although I&#x27;ve splurged on the makeup, I have not splurged on the tools so I&#x27;m still applying my makeup using the sponges that come with my cream and powder foundations (yuck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I was excited when I was given the opportunity to try the Yalmeh Foundation Brush. I thought for sure that this would improve the application, coverage, and overall use of my cream and powder foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Yalmeh Foundation brush is high quality. It is created from top grade synthetic fiber materials for long lasting use. It&#x27;s hypoallergenic, cruelty free, and vegan friendly. It doesn&#x27;t smell and it doesn&#x27;t shed - two very important qualities of a makeup brush. It is advertised to be great for all types of foundation - powder or liquid - as well as blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been specifically hoping for a good brush to apply my cream foundation however I didn&#x27;t find this one to work well with that task. The brush is super soft (a great quality!) but too soft for picking up my cream foundation or providing any coverage to my skin. It does work well with my powder foundation but given that I was hoping for something for the cream, I haven&#x27;t used the brush much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in the market for a soft, high quality brush for applying powder or blush, give the Yalmeh Foundation Brush a try. If you&#x27;re looking for something to use with a cream foundation, this might not be the brush for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been in contact with the manufacturer about my experience with the Yalmeh Foundation Brush and am grateful that they appreciate honest reviews! Yalmeh customer service is superb. They stand behind their products and offera 100% money back guarantee if you are not pleased with your purchase.</li>
    <li> Great foundation brush</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness this is one of the smoothes brushes I have every used. It spreads the makeup so nice and easy which cuts down half the time to do your makeup in the morning. Actually can sleep a extra 15 minutes because it doesn&#x27;t take long using this brush. The price is just an added bonus truth be told I would spend what ever it cost to have this brush. We be ordering more of these real soon.</li>
    <li> This Yalmeh Y19 premium quality foundation brush is at a introductory pricing at the moment. Created from the top grade synthetic long lasting hypoallergenic brush. That is also cruelty free, vegan friendly and created to leave a flawless finish much like the popular MAC foundation brush. Easy to clean with no smell and a sturdy wooden handle. This is the best brush to apply or set any of your bronzer, blush, liquid or powder foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I know I would never have been able to talk myself in to purchasing the MAC brush that this is a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;total dupe of. So getting this and seeing the price I would sooo purchase this for a friend that was in to make up and needed one. It is so freaking soft almost like a new kitten. Which makes applying foundation or powder to your face to simple and smooth that you get an even coat and coverage. Which is amazing because I usually am in a rush because I miss judge my time and save make up for last. So I do not have to go back and fix it and have to drop a set somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great brush, it has some weight to it so you know that it is not going to break in two out of no where while applying make up. Or you do not have to worry about the hairs of the brush shedding horribly and stick to the inside of your make up or worse all over your clothing. Plus, it is a simple two tone style and can blend in to most other designs of brushes out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers</li>
    <li> durable, spreads make up well, doesn&#x27;t irritate...everything you want in a brush.</li>
    <li> Blends well without leaving streaks or blotchy spots. I can apply concealer and foundation &amp;#34;seamlessly&amp;#34; whereas before with my other brush and even my sponge applicator, it would leave a caked on look.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation brush! The Yalmeh Foundation Brush is shaped kind of like a tube of lipstick, where it is slanted on one side. I had initially thought it was shaped more like a bullet from the pictures, where it is slanted on both ends and ending in a point at the top (like most other brushes of this shape).  The lipstick shape of the Yalmeh Foundation Brush makes it ideal for getting at all the curves on your face, especially beneath your eyes and around the corners of your nose. The lipstick shape also makes blotting or spotting the foundation on your face feels and looks like you&#x27;re using a blending sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristle are so incredibly soft and full, and the handle is a comfortable thickness for holding at varying angles. I used the Yalmeh Foundation Brush with both my liquid foundation and for blending my color powder beneath my eyes. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this brush and plan to use it each time I put on my makeup.</li>
    <li> The handle kiiiind of fell off while I was using it for the first time. lmao&lt;br /&gt;but the brush itself is nice.</li>
    <li> I love putting on my oil control powder with this brush: I am a 42-year old man and do not want the appearance of any powder on my face. This brush is able to blend and smooth the oil-control powder where it is not visible at all.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent brush. Reaches all the difficult spots on your face where foundation can be difficult to get on. Great around nose and under eyes, and for stippling in and filling pores.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush for my niece as a Christmas gift. She had mentioned that her old brush was very worn out and hadn&#x27;t held up well. I did a bit of research, and found this one. It seemed to be well reviewed, and I thought I would try it out. So far, she really loves it! We&#x27;ll see if it holds up well over time, but since they offer a 100 % guarantee I would recommend trying this brush out.</li>
    <li> I have had a very difficult time finding a foundation brush that I love and doesn&#x27;t fall apart within a few months! This brush is absolutely amazing! It spreads my foundation evenly and makes my skin look so much smoother than any other brush I have used. I wash my brush with mild dish soap every other day and so far, it has not lost any bristles. I also don&#x27;t need to use near as much foundation when using this brush! So far I have not one negative thing to say about this brush!  UPDATE as of four months after purchase: After about four months of use, this brush began falling apart. The handle came apart and now the bristles are falling out. I am so disappointed! I  loved this brush for the first three months, so I guess it was worth the money for the time I used it.</li>
    <li> Great brush! Soft, sturdy and applies foundation well. Also good for building up your coverage!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out, so I came home, took off my makeup and reapplied it using this brush. I must say I really love this brush!!!  It&#x27;s not my first time buying from Yalmeh and will not be the last, their products is really high quality, the design Stunning. t&#x27;s unbelievable how dense and soft this brush is!!! I have spent tons of money on foundation and I was always disappointed, I could never figure out why it never looked right...until now! This brush has answered my prayers. My makeup looks flawless. I even used this brush to apply my setting powder and my blush and it done wonderful. I will definitely be buying more from this company.</li>
    <li> I am VERY picky about my brushes. Took a gamble buying online and it paid off! This brush is fantastic at applying liquid and powder foundations...no streaking&lt;br /&gt;Like other brushes but also less coverage so I need to do 2 applications. I&#x27;ve never really used a round brush for foundation so my technique needs some work but overall this is a great brush so happy!</li>
    <li> This may be my most favorite brush in my makeup bag.  Complete, effortless coverage.  Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> So much better using a brush to put on foundation.  This is a quality brush.</li>
    <li> I purchased this particular foundation brush because of the pointed tip. With my current brush I was having a hard time getting around my eyes and nose to get a smooth finish. Tried this one just this morning and it worked perfect. Nice, sturdy handle and the brush is very good quality. Highly recommended product for those looking to get that nice, smooth finish.</li>
    <li> These Yalmeh foundation brushes are very durable and will make great xmas gifts for the holidays when i order more.</li>
    <li> I received this foundation brush a few weeks back and I really love it. To be honest with you I had never thought much about using a brush for foundation, but I was reading a beauty blog and they were talking about how you can get a much better look when you don&#x27;t use your finger to apply. And frankly, using your fingers for application is one of the reasons that I usually don&#x27;t wear foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really nice brush it has soft bristles and none of them came out when I applied my foundation. It seems sturdy and I think it should last a long time. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I was debating on getting a foundation brush for a while.  I was looking at the the buffer airbrush finish&lt;br /&gt;bamboo foundation brush from Tarte.  The reviews are really good for the Tarte brush but the cost is $32.  Enter Yalmeh!!  The shipment was fast and so far I am really pleased.  The end is rounded and not flat so you don&#x27;t just push the foundation around on your face.  This is an excellent foundation brush.  The price makes it even more attractive.</li>
    <li> Gives me an professional airbrushed look, and somehow dries my liquid foundation instantly without powder. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is truly a brush I cannot live without. My husband bought it for me a couple of weeks ago.I have used a dozen different foundation brushes, sponges etc from different brands. This brush is a little miracle worker. Finally I can apply foundation with ease and confidence. It’s soft and easy to blend. I would say it’s the best brush for the money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good...I guess but I would rather use my hands. But still soft and easy to clean after each used.</li>
    <li> This foundation brush is fantastic.  It doesn&#x27;t get sticky and clumpy like my old foundation brush did after a week&#x27;s use and the seller is genuinely concerned that I am pleased with my purchase.  And I am.  I would highly recommend it.  Very surprised with the quality at the price point.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at this foundation brush. Most synthetic brushes I&#x27;ve gotten have a sort of “paint” smell to them but there is absolutely  no smell with this brush. It’s extremely soft, it’s medium weight so it doesn&#x27;t have that “cheap” feel and the brush handle is thick which I love in a make-up brush. The only thing I took an issue with is there is slight dipping in the brush hairs, to me it looks like they weren&#x27;t cut evenly but it’s still not stopping me from using it and wouldn&#x27;t affect your make-up application. I haven’t washed it yet so I can’t say anything about shedding but I did spend a lot of time running the brush over the palms of my hands, the top of my  hand, playing with the bristles and I haven’t had not a single shed of hair come out. I received this brush in exchange for an honest review, but this is something I would definitely purchase for myself or for friends.</li>
    <li> This foundation brush is great for applying makeup, especially around the eyes and nose area.  I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality of the bristles for the price.  Bristles are very soft and full and the brush is easy to clean.  After a few washings the bristles are still in tact and none have fallen out.  I was skeptical at first but now that I&#x27;ve seen the quality I want to purchase other Yalmeh brushes.</li>
    <li> This brush has made it to the top of my favorites list for the perfect foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;It has a thick, pretty white handle. It&#x27;s very easy to grip. Perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles do look like they are very high quality. They aren&#x27;t stiff and also not too soft. They&#x27;re actually just right. I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding from them, which makes me very happy because I&#x27;ve had so many that shed right from the day that I&#x27;ve bought them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brush for both cream and liquid foundations and it works so well. I like that it works better than the flat foundation brush and sponges that I used before. I feel that the brush really does make it easier to apply my foundation and it goes on more smoothly than when I used other products. Yes, no joke, it sure can help you achieve a flawless finish. It&#x27;s probably because it works great for blending and like I said smoothes everything out. No more fine lines of makeup!&lt;br /&gt;I find it easy to clean, the same way that I clean all of my brushes. I use a little bit of olive oil to get most of the built up makeup out and some Dawn dish detergent to get it super clean. Then I rinse, and stand it in a cup with the other brushes to dry overnight. Works great and good as new when dry.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, like I said in the beginning--I love this brush. It&#x27;s also great that it is cruelty free, vegan friendly, and hypoallergenic. Those are three things I actually look for in the many products that I use everyday, as I&#x27;m sure a lot of other people look for these things as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thrilled to have this brush in my collection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a YALMEH foundation brush in exchange for an honest review. All opinions expressed are solely my own. No other compensation was received.</li>
    <li> Put my other brushes to shame. Time to get all new ones now thanks to Yalmeh showing me what a quality brush feels like on the skin. The brush part feels like rabbit fur but is vegan so obviously not but it feels that soft. The handle is pretty almost a pearly like white color but made of wood. I know because I bit it to make sure because I was skeptical. Yalmeh sent me this free to review but I was not thinking it was anything special but I was wrong. I would not use this for foundation as much as for blush or a concealer powder but I am used to a really big brush for my mineral makeup. Either way - very happy with the quality!</li>
    <li> I really like this brush....it&#x27;s tapered just right and is firm which leaves a nice finish.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I never used a foundation brush before, I&#x27;ve used lip, eyeshadow, etc., brushes but not foundation. Honestly a lot had to do with price. Some brands can be a bit pricey, I&#x27;ve seen them for $30 or more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by the Yalmeh Foundation Brush. The Yalmeh has a nice size handle making it easy to hold on to. I&#x27;ve been using a liquid foundation lately. The Yalmeh maneuvers foundation around my face easily. In fact, easier than I thought it would be. The foundation went on evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my worries of a foundation brush was the bristles. Are the bristles going to be kind of &amp;#34;stiff,&amp;#34; almost scratchy as the foundation was moved around? That wasn&#x27;t the case. The bristles were soft on my face but moved the foundation around without much effort. I think this foundation brush would also be good for mineral foundations.</li>
    <li> So, I am a brush hoarder. I just love them, having the opportunity to receive a new one, how could I say no!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is very soft, domed shaped, and thick. Now, I&#x27;m not sure if it is just my brush, or the way its cut, but it does seem like it was cut slightly off.  Mine is more slanted than dome shaped, which to me is okay, but the way I apply my foundation with a brush, if it isn&#x27;t flat, is going to be in small circles, so I would prefer a true dome. I used this one with my liquid foundation, and at first it seemed to soak up the foundation more than apply it. No worries, this is natural when using a new brush for the first time. I fully expect this to happen after washing them too, I do wash my brushes often. After washing this brush.. I can happily report, no fall out! The brush itself is solid, and does not seem to be just hot glued together, which is great, no broken handles here! However the handle is a little thick for my liking. I can use it no problem, but I do have smaller hands. So,I wish it wasn&#x27;t as fat, it is not heavy by any means either. This brush was created with synthetic fibers, which could have fooled me with out soft it is! They are vegan and cruelty free too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complementary product received for review, regardless opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> big/thick hard to use.</li>
    <li> It arrived in time and secure packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Brush is great size for foundation,blush,&lt;br /&gt;bronzer or applying highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;It is compact and easy to contour any area--- NO stray hairs!!!&lt;br /&gt;Maintaining easy with just gentle wash and air dry. A must  have for the perfect&lt;br /&gt;flawless look.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent foundation brush. I usually use boar or badger hair brushes, which as you probably know animal hair smells like wet animal when you are cleaning it. I haven&#x27;t found many synthetic brushes I like but when I was given the chance to try this product I thought it would be a great way to try out another brush and pass on my review to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush doesn&#x27;t lose a bunch of strands like most brushes I have tried, that is a huge plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it both with liquid foundation and with my bare minerals and it works great. I like to use it with my concealer as well as that looks so much better when blended with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our fingers can retain bacteria, dirt, and oils, which you don’t want on your face, a brush is the best way to put on foundation, and all make up, and it not only looks the best but lasts the longest that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean my brush using baby shampoo, just a tiny drop. rinse it off and let it dry. Treat your brushes nicely and they will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my Yalmeh foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attached is a picture from stylescoop, it is how i clean all my brushes. Incase you are wondering, the red thing used to clean the brushes is a dog shampoo brush, other things like it would work, but i got mine off amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.stylescoop.co.za/2014/01/21/clean-makeup-brushes/</li>
    <li> I have never been able to master how to apply foundation with anything other than my fingers. I have seen so many people say how much better using a brush is. I tried several types of brushes and they just clumped up on me. It would cake the makeup on. But with the Yalmeh Brush, it made my foundation go on smooth and felt really soft against my skin. Not rough like other brushes I&#x27;ve used. Very awesome brush and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It spreads my foundation flawlessly.  Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> My wife received this foundation brush as a gift from her sister over in America and she really loves it because it&#x27;s so soft, easy to use and carry around. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Great brush, good quality</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend the YALMEH Foundation Brush! As someone who once worked for Lancôme cosmetics, I know the importance of using a quality makeup brush to apply foundation. This brush is soft and application of foundation is easy and precise! I apply the liquid foundation to my face then evenly distribute with my brush for a beautiful finish! A+</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my wife and she loves it. She says it&#x27;s really soft and doesn&#x27;t shed. The company shipped it very quickly too. Excellent service.</li>
    <li> REALLY, this is the best make up brush EVER! It applies my make up evenly! I even use it to apply my concealer and it does an incredible job! This is my one all usage brush! Thanks so much for this efficient product1 the brush bristles are so soft! My make up looks air brushed after application! I really love it! Great customer service too! I am committed to this business and product! I am purchasing another for my on the go mode!</li>
    <li> Just as described! Waited too long to order, don&#x27;t wait like I did! Great product and you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I got this brush for free from Yalmeh for free to try and review, regardless this is my 100% honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t generally use liquid or powder foundations because it just doesn’t look right on me. Some people put in on and you can’t even tell they are wearing it. Something about my skin it just doesn’t blend in even if I have the right color. It gets all caked on looking and makes my face look dried out and gross. I sometimes use some BB creams mixed with my moisturizer when I really do need to “fix my face” because I have breakouts or my skin coloring is off (I have sensitive skin so often I get that red slapped or sunburned look when testing out new products). When I do apply makeup this way I like to use a good foundation brush to help make it look blended and not caked on like sponges sometimes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is as described with a solid handle and it is packed with bristles. They are synthetic fibers, but they are actually very soft to the touch making this brush gentle to use on your face. I rubbed the bristles between my fingers roughly for a bit just to check it and none of the fibers came loose or fell out which is a good sign to. When I&#x27;ve gotten cheap brushes this simple test starts popping out a few fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like this brush will hold up well under washing and wear for awhile and am glad I added it to my arsenal of brushes for my makeup.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, the price too is awesome. I&#x27;m becoming a BIG fan of this Yalmeh brand.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I didn&#x27;t realize how helpful it is to have a contoured brush.  It&#x27;s very easy and smooth to use. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I like the brush, just thinking I am using more foundation than if I just use my fingers</li>
    <li> I’ve always used sponges and beauty blenders, and since that worked fine I never bothered with brushes. But recently Yalmeh Beauty sent me this brush to review, their Foundation Brush. It is synthetic fibers, but it feels super soft and not scratchy at all like you get with some cheap synthetic brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dampen the brush a bit before using it with my latest foundation, Covergirl Trublend in classic beige. It blends out really easily, and doesn’t leave streak marks and it’s super easy to build up full coverage with this brush. It has a wooden handle with a metal cap towards the end, and it hasn’t shed any hairs so far. So I’m really liking this brush!</li>
    <li> What a great brush this is. I loved using this for days when I need to get out the door quickly and want to look amazing. This brush gets product where it needs to be and it looks like airbrush. This brush also had no fallout and cleans up nicely when it&#x27;s washed. The bristles are super soft and the handle is not only pretty but the perfect size for pretty much all makeup applying hands. i am going to look into more of Yalmeh&#x27;s brushes in the future. Yalmeh did send this to me to review but trust me I would not write about it if I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I have never used a brush to apply my foundation, until now.  I love the brush!  My makeup goes on more smoothly using this brush.  I will never go back to using a sponge pad.</li>
    <li> The brush is incredibly soft and easy to use. I used this as it was intended as a foundation brush and it applies my makeup well and was easy to blend out my liquid foundation. It gets into the corners of my nose and around my eyes easily. It does take a bit more time for the entire face since it is smaller than the brush I normally use. I prefer a larger brush for all over and this to clean up and get into the crevices of my face like and started to use it to finish off my foundation routine to smooth out the areas around my nose, eyes and mouth. It give a flawless finish. It is also amazing to blends out concealer under the eyes and all over the face which is my preferred use for it. I mostly love the softness and the flawless finish it gives.  I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and unbiased opinions</li>
    <li> I use liquid foundation and have tried foundation brushes before and didn&#x27;t like the out come. I normally use my fingers to apply my makeup. But I had the opportunity to try this out for free from Yalmeh. I was not expecting much since I had not like the way the other brushes had made my makeup look. I used it and I love the way my makeup turn out. The brush is really soft so its not ruff on your skin. The bristles are very soft and doesn&#x27;t come out when you apply your foundation. This brush is made really well and will last along time.</li>
    <li> This brush is super soft and easy to hold onto while applying your make up. Make up goes on steak free and smooth. I love the angle on the bristles it is a nice touch to easily to get into little spots and apply where you want it! So far so good works like a charm!</li>
    <li> I always hate foundation brushes because they leave streaks on my face so I was a little apprehensive to try this one. I was completely sick of this foundation getting on my hands so I gave it a go and I am not disappointed by this product at all. I cant say it enough how this has been a game changed for my make up. It is made very well and I am all for the cruelty free and vegan so it is such a blessing to find this. EVERYONE NEED THIS! I cant think of one negative thing to say about it because there is not one bad thing you can say.</li>
    <li> Better than I thought it would be. I can use this to apply my powder from my compact and it does a wonderful job. Better than sponges or other brushes I have used. I am able to get total coverage. Doesn&#x27;t seem like such a small brush would work, but this one is great. Nice quality. Very much worth it.</li>
    <li> I got this brush for my girlfriend as she was in need of a higher quality brush for foundation, and this brush has been everything and more that she wanted. It shipped here speedily, came in nice packaging, and looks great! The quality, especially for the price, is terrific! There is ZERO fallout and using it for application is easy and looks great. Overall, I like the results I&#x27;ve seen from it, and so does my girl. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Really good brush. Highly recommend. Makeup goes on flawlessly.</li>
    <li> Yalmeh&#x27;s Y19 foundation brush is my new favorite. I love everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the perfect combination of softness and firmness. The bristles are synthetic, but they don&#x27;t shed, feel rough, or poke you. They actually feel really soft and smooth, and are firm enough to apply liquid foundation without having that hard, overly stiff feel like some other brushes. The tapered end is perfect for getting any area of your face.&lt;br /&gt;You can use this for both powder and liquid foundation, I have even used it for finishing powder and it still worked great. I have had nothing but smooth and even application while using this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its really easy to wash and just as easy to use. It can take a while to dry after washing, but you can easily dry it with a blow dryer without causing any damage to the brush. It has a sturdy feel with a smooth wooden handle that feels nice in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I could see this in any professional&#x27;s kit. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality foundation brush. I can&#x27;t wait to try Yalmeh&#x27;s other brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
    <li> I am very excited to be sharing this review on the Yalmeh foundation make-up brush. I promise you this is my honest and truthful opinion and i don not hype this product or any product up that i truly did not use and or like, with that said this is honestly the last foundation brush you will ever need! Why am i saying that you ask? Well ill tell you right now. This one brush can be used for much more then just foundation yup you read this sentence right, This brush has a sleek angled tip to get around those hard to reach places like the nose, under our eyes and lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Yalmeh brush is created from top grade synthetic fiber materials for long lasting use. The higher quality fibers prevent shedding like we experience on most make-up brushes. This helps make the brush last for as long as you own the brush.Hypoallergenic, Cruelty Free, and Vegan Friendly!! I also love that the Yalmeh Y19 premium quality Foundation brush helped spotlight my natural beauty and left a flawless finish. it reminded me of a mac foundation brush. It was also very easy to clean up and had no stains or smells when it dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This brush has a very sleek beautiful handle, and as mentioned before the tip is made from synthetic fibers that give your make-up a perfect smooth application. Also as mentioned above one of the many reasons i love this brush is because it has more then one purpose. The brush can be used for bronzing and applying blush, liquid foundation, powder foundation, as a a blending brush. I loved this brush and look forward be making this a permanent family member to my make-up collection and must haves! This is my Honest and truthful opinion and i do not recommend products i have not used and or liked to my readers.</li>
    <li> I received my brush a couple of days ago, and I absolutely love, love this foundation brush!!! I have quite a few foundation brushes, but, this one gives me a Flawless Look. I&#x27;ve already clean my brush, and absolutely no fall out!&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more products from Yalmeh.</li>
    <li> This make up brush is very poor quality made me break out.won&#x27;t be buying ever again. This  is a terrible brush.don&#x27;t recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Foundation Brush is one of my most important tool and if I have to choose only one brush, it would be foundation brush. For the past 3 years my Sigma Flat Kabuki F80 was my best friend when it comes to foundation application, and even though the brush still looks perfect, I really wanted to try something new. Yalmeh Y19 Foundation Brush is my new go-to brush, which I like so much and had to include in my Best Of 2014 Beauty Products on my YouTube Channel.&lt;br /&gt;Yalmeh Y19 Foundation Brush is very well made and easy to use kabuki brush that has a rounded end with a pointed tip.  The bristles are synthetic, and it is recommended to be used for applying liquid and powder foundation, as well as blush and bronzer. Yalmeh Y19 Foundation Brush does not shed, is very easy to clean and it has no smell. The handle of the brush is beautiful and comfortable to hold, and allows great control and precision when applying foundation. The tapered tip helps you get to hard-to-reach areas around the nose, mouth, and corners of the eyes. Yalmeh Y19 Foundation Brush is soft and delivers great coverage without streaking. I use the side of it to apply foundation to the larger areas of the face, such as cheeks and forehead, and I use the pointed tip to precisely apply foundation around the eyes, nose and mouth.  The pointy tip is also ideal for concealer application, as well as spot treatment of blemishes and redness on the skin.  This brush easily buffs and blends foundation products, resulting in a seamless and flawless finish. Yalmeh Y19 Foundation Brush is Hypoallergenic, Cruelty Free and Vegan Friendly.&lt;br /&gt;_______________________________&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for testing purposes. All opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I&#x27;m very pick with what I buy to use on my face. I generally use Sigma brushes but this one came in as a pleasant surprise&lt;br /&gt;Soft but at the same time firm. Great for foundation and concealer. You won&#x27;t regret!!!</li>
    <li> Bristles are soft and do not shed. The shape of the brush allows me to get in every crease of my face. I also use it to apply my under eye concealer because the narrow end allows me to smooth it right up to my lash area.&lt;br /&gt;This has become my favorite brush for foundation and concealer application.</li>
    <li> Arrived early. Is as nice as the other reviewers said. Soft like bunny tail. The tip is great for edges and corners. The best part was how fast I could put my liquid foundation on....compared to my old brush. And no streaking. My face was more covered and smooth. I&#x27;m used to the flat square brushes and was worried that this thicker brush would soak up more of the makeup.....but it didn&#x27;t. It spread it on my face effortlessly and the nice thick handle was nice. Great control. And it does look very expensive. Well worth the $11 I paid. I almost want to buy another. I think I might!</li>
    <li> I have seen videos of people using brushes to apply their foundation but had never tried it. I was truly amazed at how flawless my foundation went on with a brush(liquid or powder). The brush is full, thick and very soft. Also the brush is very pretty, well made and had a great hand feel. The brush is very easy to clean also and you can use a brush cleaning solution to clean it. I would say the YALMEH Foundation Brush cab easily hold it&#x27;s own against the more expensive brushes for much less money out of your pocket. The brush is listed as a foundation brush but it can be used for so much more-bronzer, blush, setting powder-you name it! So you might want to pick-up more than 1 brush. It’s a great quality brush for a great price and would make a great gift for the make-up junkie in your life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> The Yalmeh Foundation Brush, also known as Y19 Foundation Brush, is an easy-to-hold and easy-to-use brush. It can be used with any kind of foundation, be it liquid or cream or mineral or pressed. I chose to use it with a creamy foundation that I had been applying with pieces of sponge. I will admit that I think that I had put a bit too much foundation on the brush when I was getting ready to use it! I&#x27;ve been using cream foundation intermittently in the past 4 years, I&#x27;m more of a CC or BB cream gal. Yalmeh&#x27;s foundation brush was definitely gentle on my face, and that made me happy! I did like how it was easy to hold, and fit in my hand nicely. I didn&#x27;t have a hard time cleaning it, either! It leaves a flawless finish, and it&#x27;s comparable to a Mac foundation brush. It&#x27;s made from synthetic fibers and doesn&#x27;t shed! (I have an old brush of some other brand, and boy does it shed like a cat or a dog!). It&#x27;s also vegan-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received free product in order to facilitate my review! The opinions expressed are my own!</li>
    <li> Prior to using this brush, I&#x27;d never really used a brush for my foundation before.  SO, it was a completely new and unique experience for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is a really attractive brush and is really sturdy and extremely well made.  I was really pleased with it&#x27;s appearance and the hairs on the brush have a tapered shape.  The hairs are pretty soft and pleasing when using on my face, they don&#x27;t feel scratchy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen several different foundation brushes and this one is a little different shape from other foundation brushes I&#x27;ve seen.  However, the way that it&#x27;s shaped makes it really easy to get in the little creases next to your nose and around your eyes, etc.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be using a brush instead of a sponge for foundation only because I&#x27;ve just been using a sponge for forever and it&#x27;s hard to get used to using a brush when your so used to using a sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since tested a few foundation brushes and this is by far one of the nicest that I&#x27;ve tried.  It is much nicer than other foundation brushes and for the price, seems to be a really good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I received this for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I always was wearing my foundation using my fingers. Long time ago I have try sponge and thought it’s a time consuming and no big difference in coverage. And I get Yalmeh Foundation Brush. The brush is high quality and created from top grade synthetic fiber materials for long lasting use. It&#x27;s hypoallergenic, cruelty free, and vegan friendly. It doesn&#x27;t smell and it doesn&#x27;t shed. It has a lovely, white pearl wooden handle with gold metal on it. It looks so elegant and pretty. I love the softness of bristle and cone shape helps to get my foundation in the corners of my eyes and nose. My makeup went on so well. I used brush in quick circular motions to buff foundation over forehead, cheeks, and chin. Foundation Brush gives me perfect coverage and a smooth silky finish. I have to tell, I have used more foundation than normal but my finger was clean.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I wish brush has some case for easy carrying for example to trip.&lt;br /&gt;I have washed the Yalmeh Foundation Brush with warm water and my hair shampoo, thoroughly rinse. I let my brush air dry and about 24 hours it was ready to use again.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to anyone who wants to look flawless.</li>
    <li> If you prefer a tapered foundation brush, give this one a go. Yalmeh sent it to me for review, and I was really impressed with the quality!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think I prefer my flat top sigma f80, but this is by FAR the best tapered foundation brush I have found.</li>
    <li> When I first started using foundation a few years ago I always used my hands to apply it. Then recently I learned that there are foundation brushes out there - who knew? I have been using one that I got in a kit of brushes, it is flat and works fine. I never went looking for a new foundation brush because I figured they all were the exact same and that they would all be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I got the opportunity to test out a foundation brush from Yalmeh. The description online says that it is made cruelty free, with high quality materials, and doesn&#x27;t shed. I was a little skeptical because I believed it would be exactly like the brush I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy was I wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really sets this brush apart for me is that it is rounded and not flat. This made applying my foundation much easier. It helped me get an even amount of foundation all over every centimeter of my face! I used it with liquid foundation and found that the bristles don&#x27;t stick together like my old brush did and it stays soft and fluffy! (Although it is turning the color of my foundation... I should probably wash it today!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company says that this brush can be used for bronzer, foundation, liquid foundation, and blush! I use it simply for foundation because I like to have specific brushes for each product I use. (That may be a little OCD of me but I don&#x27;t want my products mixing on brushes.) But the great thing about the versatility of this brush is that if I want to switch from liquid to powder I can use this same brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar to the lipstick I posted about previously, this brush is made cruelty free which is really important to me. I love all animals and would hate to see any of them harmed just so I could have a good beauty product!</li>
    <li> This is the first foundation brush that didn&#x27;t shed!  I love the angles too</li>
