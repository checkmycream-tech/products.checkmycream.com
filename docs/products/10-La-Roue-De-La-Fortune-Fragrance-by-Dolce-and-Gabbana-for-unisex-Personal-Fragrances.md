<li> this is the only numbered D&amp;G formula in my opinion that smells masculine</li>
<li> Package was new, looks like any other new in box perfume.</li>
<li> POSSIBLY not quite as long lasting, and because these were discontinued I purchased knowing they may be past &amp;#34;expiration&amp;#34; (which just like on medication is probably very conservative).  </li>
<li> A very soft &amp; subtle white floral.</li>
<li> When I purchased at Nordstrom, it was a limited edition offering...</li>
<li> but this one just smells like a lab full of fake, synthetic scents.  </li>
<li> I gave five stars because the other bottle im using of the fragrance I purchased from here</li>
<li> If not, then it&#x27;s an acceptable copy just like other reviewers have said.  </li>
<li> There are a billion other fragrances I&#x27;d wear over this.  </li>
<li> Dolce &amp; Gabbana isn&#x27;t technically a niche line, however, once you smell/wear this you&#x27;ll find it hard to believe it&#x27;s not niche.</li>
<li> 5-stars all the way down the line.</li>
<li> crazy Fella&#x27;s.</li>
<li> Oh, by the way, just to add: I gave this to my man and it smells equally bad on him.  </li>
<li> I am very disappointed that it has been discontinued, that&#x27;s why I had to buy two!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The first time I tried this perfume I loved it! Had gotten it for my son and I ended up using it!!! This one didn&#x27;t smell as great as the first one.</li>
    <li> Seems authentic to me, just like ones purchased at the department store back when these were still on the shelf.  If not, then it&#x27;s an acceptable copy just like other reviewers have said.  POSSIBLY not quite as long lasting, and because these were discontinued I purchased knowing they may be past &amp;#34;expiration&amp;#34; (which just like on medication is probably very conservative).  But the price makes up for that!  I&#x27;m a guy....this is the only numbered D&amp;G formula in my opinion that smells masculine and I get (sometimes over the top) compliments every time I wear it.  Was originally recommended to me at a store, otherwise would not have ventured into these female/male formulas.</li>
    <li> this is by far my favorite fragranc.. been wearing it for years!! if I don&#x27;r wear this I have on Givenchiey delight noir......... it is a must have !! I have only found it at Nordstroms................. Best ever!!</li>
    <li> I cannot STAND this cologne.  I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking when I spritzed it on at the mall one time and thought I actually liked it.  I like the idea of unisex colognes...but this one just smells like a lab full of fake, synthetic scents.  There are a billion other fragrances I&#x27;d wear over this.  Oh, by the way, just to add: I gave this to my man and it smells equally bad on him.  I think we&#x27;ll just throw it out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume. I am very disappointed that it has been discontinued, that&#x27;s why I had to buy two!! Great product!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Will continue to buy It. Have been using this for many many years and a light and great smell.</li>
    <li> Package was new, looks like any other new in box perfume. I haven&#x27;t opened it yet only because I still have another bottle im working to finish. I gave five stars because the other bottle im using of the fragrance I purchased from here and im hands down in love. This makes two bottles from here and so far ive been extremely happy</li>
    <li> I love this. It&#x27;s a Unisex sent that Drives the ladies crazy Fella&#x27;s. I keep two bottle stocked at all times and at 30 something bucks thats a great price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great smell&#x27;s soft and not strong sense!! I wear it for daytime at work eveyone loves the smell!! Great price too!!</li>
    <li> The best smell for men or women! Never get tired of it, it truly is great and awesome. Try itl.</li>
    <li> Ive had this stuff before and loved it. It was first sold as a unisex item and now its only marketed for women. BOOOOOOOOOO! IDGAF im still buying it. One of my top 5 favorite D&amp;G scents to date</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent!&lt;br /&gt;Great seller.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this perfume via amazon, as my first bottle is getting low.  Great prices.  Love it.</li>
    <li> A very soft &amp; subtle white floral. Pineapple freshens it up and there&#x27;s a good amount of patchouli present. This could definitely be a unisex. Work safe. Unobtrusive.</li>
    <li> Would recommend to anyone interested in this perfume. I think it&#x27;s a knock off but a very good one at that.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. A quick spray and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorites!!! Clean smelling and not to heavy, mellow but intoxicating!  Good for late afternoon and evening!</li>
    <li> 5-stars all the way down the line. This eau de toilette is fantastic. Very sensual, rich, deep, not overpowering, lasting, and well-priced. There are three others in this line I&#x27;ll be purchasing and will let you know my thoughts at that time. I do wish this was available in eau de parfum. Dolce &amp; Gabbana isn&#x27;t technically a niche line, however, once you smell/wear this you&#x27;ll find it hard to believe it&#x27;s not niche. Love Love!</li>
    <li> But leave it to Amazon!  My Sister in law had noticed this fragrance on me and mentioned how much she liked it.  When I purchased at Nordstrom, it was a limited edition offering...so obviously I was thrilled to find it on Amazon....sent it directly to her for her birthday and she was so happy!</li>
