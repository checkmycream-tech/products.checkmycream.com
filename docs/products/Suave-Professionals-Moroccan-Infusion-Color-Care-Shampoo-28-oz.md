      <li>I&#x27;ve had too many of them disappoint me.</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sold on the color care part of this shampoo, but I do love the smell of it and the way it lingers</li>
      <li>This product has knocked out all contenders to become my favorite shampoo.</li>
      <li>I really love the scent of this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>shampoo/conditioner smell is more exotic-y than flowery.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of the coconut smell, so it was perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent was ok if you like vanilla.  </li>
      <li>It is fabulous!</li>
      <li>You will not find a better shampoo for the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo numerous times and I&#x27;ve been really impressed with the results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of the products in the line and this shampoo is no exception.</li>
      <li>I had better luck with the Color Care type of this shampoo, then I did with the Shine shampoo.</li>
      <li>Also, the dryness and static electricity was gone.</li>
      <li>I would like to say I love this shampoo, but I can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unique ingredient, and nice smell comes from the inclusion of the Moroccan argan oil.</li>
      <li>I really love the smell of this and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too strong</li>
      <li>Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner 28 oz was so good, using the same line of shampoo would be a good idea</li>
      <li>/&gt;While the shampoo works great on my hair and makes it very soft and easy to work with out of the shower, the scent is too strong for me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Otherwise i love how quick and easy it lathers up, and makes my hair feel nice and clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a flower, fruit, perfume, CLEAN, nature smell like most cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and this product is absolutely the best!!!</li>
      <li>It seemed strong out of the bottle, but once lathered and rinsed, the remaining scent was not too strong</li>
      <li>it went on easily, lathered up nicely, had a pleasant smell, and left my hair clean and not feeling stripped.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and my hairs feels super soft after I use it!</li>
      <li>It strikes me as a new \\&quot;tea tree oil\\&quot; type product, that is claimed to be good for a lot of things.</li>
      <li>and it cleans just fine.</li>
      <li>First, it lathers up perfectly, which means I don&#x27;t have to wash it a second time just to \\&quot;feel\\</li>
      <li>I like the scent (rather exotic but fades quickly)</li>
      <li>I will say it certainly doesn&#x27;t make the color fade faster, so between that and the nice moisturizing benefits</li>
      <li>Overall i am happy with it, but this is not a shampoo for everyone...&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also seems to help my coloring looking more fresh for longer.</li>
      <li>smooth and shiny, without being oily.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it does not smell like a cheap shampoo.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t soap up easily and I felt I couldn&#x27;t get my hair really clean.  </li>
      <li>She had great results; her hair was left shiny &amp; manageable after using  both the shampoo &amp; conditioner in Suave&#x27;s Professionals Moroccan line.</li>
      <li>While Suave has a (well deserved) reputation for cheap products, this does not feel like cheap</li>
      <li>About once a week, she also uses the Shine Mask &amp; Styling Oil in this same line, &amp; has had great results.</li>
      <li>so it gives me just enough scent through the day that I love and people have commented on my hair smelling good, too.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft, and smelling good.</li>
      <li>As it is right now, we both love the Suave Professionals Moroccan line of hair care products &amp; will continue to use them.</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance which is kind of warm and a little spicy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought the conditioner along with the shampoo and wanted to try something with Moroccan oil since I heard so much about it. I am black but have mixed textured hair that is very thick and curly. My hair is relaxed and colored so I wanted to try something for my color treated hair. This shampoo is great because when you have hair that is not naturally straight and you are ethnic, you can&#x27;t just use any shampoo because the shampoo strips the hair of oils and tangles the hair leaving it hard. This shampoo is wonderful. My hair is long so I always wash it twice and I go through a lot of bottle but this one is large so it will last me 2 months. I would recommend this Suave line to anyone because its great for all hair types. My boyfriend is Ukrainian and tends to have oily hair but this was great because he didn&#x27;t have to put any product in his hair after he conditioned it. The shipping was very quick and the price is great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about anyone else but we are losing hair every time we use it! I switched to another brand &amp; no problem! Went back to this &amp; hair calling out again! Enough hair to cover the drain! Throwing it out!!</li>
    <li> I really love the scent of this shampoo.  It works well and leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable. I will certainly continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about the  scent before ordering and I still went ahead and ordered it.  For anyone still deciding: The scent is stronger.  It is very similar to the scent of other Moroccan Oil/Argan Oil products.  When using these products I have often received compliments about how nice my hair smells.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great shampoo.  The added Moroccan oil is great for my hair.  You will not find a better shampoo for the price.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t soap up easily and I felt I couldn&#x27;t get my hair really clean.  Additionally, the shampoo was very difficult to wash out and my hair felt clumpy, dry and hard afterwards.</li>
    <li> It is what it says and does what it says. Very pleased with it and have to keep typing til it tells me I can submit lol</li>
    <li> That this is better than any expensive brand out there. DO not tell as I want to keep buying for less than $5</li>
    <li> My head is ssssooooo sore. I was using this product that came in a gift basket and after 2 weeks i started getting bumps in my hairline, then my hair started falling out, my head itches and when i scratch there are bumps, hair is super tangly which is not normal Im gong back to my regular shampoo</li>
    <li> This shampoo made my hair soft and shiny. The price is good and it worked well for me. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo/conditioner for several months now and have noticed some nice improvement from my dry and brittle ends.  It adds shine/moisture to my dry areas without making my hair oily. My hair feels softer AND cleaner (not like I&#x27;ve put detergent on it to strip it clean). That&#x27;s all I really ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to rant and rave. It&#x27;s not a miracle cure. My hair still has issues. I still have to work with it, fix it, style it. But I like this Moroccan product better than any other non-salon products I&#x27;ve tried before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the SMELL (big subject with this one):&lt;br /&gt;Go to the stores and test the smell for yourself before you buy this!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of those that you either will like it or possibly HATE it. Seriously. It&#x27;s different.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a flower, fruit, perfume, CLEAN, nature smell like most cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a spice, cologne, musk sort of scent to it. It&#x27;s a heavy scent. It&#x27;s strong when you&#x27;re using it, but it doesn&#x27;t linger so much once washed out and out of the shower. Personally, I think it just throws people because it&#x27;s not the ~common~ type of artificial fragrance put in cleansers (they&#x27;re all fake-used to fool you into THINKING you&#x27;re getting cleaner, anyway) but don&#x27;t get this larger size bottle (this is twice the size of standard shampoo/conditioner bottles) before knowing the scent.</li>
    <li> Great value for the money, especially compared to other Argan oil products.</li>
    <li> I wash my hair every day and this shampoo is perfect. I love the smell. I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it does not smell like a cheap shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought the expensive Pureology Hydrating shampoo. My natural hair was always super shiny. Now that I color it to cover some grey, I tried Pureology, as recommended by a friend.  It left my hair dry, dull and full of static electricity.  As soon as I used Suave Moroccan Argan Oil color care shampoo the luster and shine was back immediately.  Also, the dryness and static electricity was gone. I have learned that all the hype about not having sulfates in shampoos is a gimmick.  My hair feels so much cleaner with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Leaves a nice lingerinf fragrance in your hair!</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference on vibrancy of color or even softer feel. It smells great and leaves your hair feeling light, but hair color seems to fade as usual. Price wise it is competive with retail. I&#x27;m not sold on it, though, and prefer my usual brand I purchase much cheaper than retail on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizing shampoo with a light, pleasant scent.  My hair gets very dry in the winter due to steaming-hot showers, and this has helped considerably.  I can&#x27;t make any determination one way or the other about whether it helps hold color -- it&#x27;s hard to tell.  I will say it certainly doesn&#x27;t make the color fade faster, so between that and the nice moisturizing benefits, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusions shampoo works like a charm! Combined with the conditioner, the products give results that mirror the higher priced Moroccan oil products. I loved the smooth, silky texture and the glossy shine in my hair. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> for the price you cant beat it. cleans my hair well without weighing it down and combine with the conditioner it makes my coarse wild hair tame, shiny and smooth</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo for my wife. After she used the bottle she claims for the price, it works very well. However she did not notice much of a difference compared to \\&quot;non color care\\&quot; shampoo. She said it does leave her hair soft and silky, but it did nothing for her color. But for the price, she couldn&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that I&#x27;d be the hero when I got this.  But, the lady can&#x27;t stop talking about how great \\&quot;Argan oil\\&quot; is for the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have the complete set and there&#x27;s definitely a difference in her hair.  What exactly is Argan oil?  I don&#x27;t have a clue.  But, it works and she was plenty excited after I opened the box and asked her if she knew what this was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product - it went on easily, lathered up nicely, had a pleasant smell, and left my hair clean and not feeling stripped.  For the price difference of more expensive Moroccan oil products, I feel there is good value here.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love This shampoo! Smells great and my hairs feels super soft after I use it!</li>
    <li> This product has knocked out all contenders to become my favorite shampoo. First, it lathers up perfectly, which means I don&#x27;t have to wash it a second time just to \\&quot;feel\\&quot; clean. Second, it leaves my hair squeaky clean and smelling fabulous. Seriously, I would love to have a perfume version of this fragrance!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always worried when I dye my hair that it is going to destroy it.  So, for that reason, I have started using this great Moroccan shampoo that Suave Professionals started recommending, this is a great choice that you should try out if you have color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I first tried the Moroccan Oil shampoo when I got a trial size of [[ASIN:B008CYGCIU Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Shampoo-13 oz (Quantity of 3)]].  The stuff made my hair incredibly soft but I learned I had to rinse it really well or it would be grungy looking after a day of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that this Suave version works just as well but at a fifth of the cost.  I like the scent (rather exotic but fades quickly), it lathers well, I rinse a lot, and am left with soft, shiny hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I use shampoo at 10 times the rate of the conditioner, I&#x27;ll continue to use my Organix conditioner but will use this Suave shampoo with it.  Good deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: both my daughter and I had to stop using any product with argan oil after we developed an allergy that started with a rash on our scalp and forehead and moved down our faces.  The dermatologist prescribed a very expensive ointment but I never purchased it and the rash went away for both of us shortly after we stopped using the shampoo.  I hate that because it really did make my hair look good.</li>
    <li> Suave&#x27;s Moroccan Infusion line has been really consistently good. I&#x27;ve tried many of the products in the line and this shampoo is no exception. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo numerous times and I&#x27;ve been really impressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo leaves my hair feeling smoother than many other shampoos. Sometimes my hair gets matted if I don&#x27;t use conditioner, but that wasn&#x27;t the case with this shampoo. It also works great with the accompanying conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Moroccan Infusion shampoo is a great product that you&#x27;ll definitely want to try if you&#x27;re looking for a new shampoo. I was really impressed with the results.</li>
    <li> The smell is a novelty at the beginning, but as time goes on, it&#x27;s a bit much!</li>
    <li> Very pleasant scent, definite cleaning power but too many chemicals and not enough natural ingredients, just a personal preference though. Other than the ingredient list it really is great.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is supposedly formulated to preserve and enhance the colour in coloured and chemically treated hair.  I split this bottle with my mom as she has coloured hair to hide the grey, while I have recently had a Brazilian blowout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Leaves hair softer than other comparably shampoos such as Pantene for coloured hair and Brunette by John Frieda&lt;br /&gt;+ Soft vanilla scent. It seemed strong out of the bottle, but once lathered and rinsed, the remaining scent was not too strong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- while gentle on hair, it does not seem to clean the scalp too well and both my mom and I needed to shampoo twice to really wash the roots of our hair after a long session at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;- Needs a second washing to really feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;- The second washing means more product is used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the lather is ok, the texture of hair softer but no extra shine was noticeable in neither daylight nor indoor light.  The scent was ok if you like vanilla.  Over the course of a few weeks, both my mom and I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference between this and other drugstore shampoos for coloured and chemically treated hair in terms of preserving colour or shine or preventing split ends.  The main difference this product has over others is that it leaves hair softer (possibly a result of the Argan oil).  We also seem to go through this product twice as quickly as the Pantene or John Frieda possibly because we have to shampoo twice to get the scalp really clean after sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended with reservations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Shampoo for a month now and the change in my hair has been remarkable. I have corse think hair that I straighten daily. After using this shampoo for a few weeks my hair maintained shine consistently. I know longer have frizz or fly aways! I would recommend this to anyone with complex hair.</li>
    <li> Let me first say I have never wrote a review yet, until now, I have coarse wavy hair and I have been wanting to try this line from Suave, let me start by saying as I was using this I thought, wow! it lathered really well and felt soft while I was shampooing but, after I blew dry my hair, my hair felt hprriable! It was unmanageable and dry feeling and kept waving up throughout the day, tje next morning I had to blow it out like three times to get it straight and it still kept waving up! Terriable product, I returned it to the store and went back to Loreal&#x27;s new line which is fantastic! Would not rwcommend at all!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo after trying the Moroccan Infusion conditioner and finding that I liked it even better than the conditioner that I&#x27;ve been using for a few years Suave Professionals, conditioner, humectant moisture, 28oz. I figured since the conditioner Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner 28 oz was so good, using the same line of shampoo would be a good idea and I figured the color care would not strip my hair of color. I love the fragrance which is kind of warm and a little spicy. I also like the way it leaves my hair looking clean but with plenty of moisture so that it&#x27;s manageable and easy to comb out when it&#x27;s wet, right out of the shower. I find that when I curl my hair with a curling iron, it still has the wave in it the following day. I attribute this to the conditioning ability of the shampoo and conditioner. This is my new favorite Suave brand.</li>
    <li> I loved the way my hair felt after using this shampoo &amp; conditioner BUT I seem to be in a minority here re the smell.  The one I had was HEAVILY perfumed---it reminded me of the dime store fragrances from my girlhood days.  UGH!  And the smell lingered for a full day and 1/2.  Is it possible I just got a bottle that had been too heavily scented?  The scent was so nauseating that I returned it.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo...especially the scent! Mmmmm... makes my bathroom smell great during a shower. It left my hair feeling silky and smooth. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Shampoo &amp; Conditioner on a daily basis for a week and like the results a lot. This shampoo has the same ingredients as the Moroccan Infusion Shine Shampoo. Both products leave my shoulder length, medium to fine hair more shiny &amp; soft than any other hair care products. The results were noticeable after a single wash/rinse/dry, but my hair seemed to be more \\&quot;tired\\&quot; looking after a night&#x27;s sleep with the Color Care shampoo/condition combo (probably because of the additional sunscreen products in the Color Care conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo/conditioner smell is more exotic-y than flowery. My best guess is that the manufacturer wanted us to think of beaches/suntans rather than gardens/flowers. As best I can tell, the smell seems to be a combination of almond-y-vanilla &amp; coconut. It is a fairly heavy scent &amp; it stays with your hair until about mid-day before subsiding. However, scent-wise, it is no heavier than some other brand name products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo/conditioner rinses out well, and my hair does not frizz after blow-drying.  With little additional product, it allows my hair to keep a style for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this new Suave product because my hair has never been shinier or softer. However, having tried both the Shine shampoo &amp; the Color Care shampoo, and because the ingredient list is the same on both products, it really makes no difference whether you choose the Shine or Color Care shampoo (the conditioners are slightly different in that the Color Care conditioner had added sunscreens). Once I deplete my regular Suave line-up, I will move over to the professional line-up and not look back.</li>
    <li> Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Shampoo has a very strong but inoffensive odor, earthy and sweet at the same time.  It cleans thoroughly and rinses out well and leaves the hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Shampoo.  Leaves hair soft, smooth, clean.  Perfect.  No complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has such a pleasant scent.  I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it, other than a soft, powdery scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave is a trust name brand that I&#x27;ve used as long as I can remember.  Perfect product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recomended.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it, improves hair, great scent and made a believer out of me.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and the regular Moroccan shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I use the whole line of product.  The only thing that would make it better is a mousse and/or gel so i don&#x27;t lose the awesome smell.  My hair has never softer and smoother.  I have naturally curly hair and this product is absolutely the best!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sold on the color care part of this shampoo, but I do love the smell of it and the way it lingers and it cleans just fine. I usually swap between Pantene and Aussie as I am one of those that believes my hair builds tolerance and I need to go between shampoos (I know I&#x27;ve read this is a myth but my hair disagrees, lol). I really love the smell of this and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too strong, however I also don&#x27;t wear perfumes or anything like that so it gives me just enough scent through the day that I love and people have commented on my hair smelling good, too. Recommended.</li>
    <li> For reference, I have baby fine, long, wavy hair, which has highlights and lowlights and the ends of my hair tend to get dryed out. My usual and favorite shampoo is Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Shampoo and I also use the matching conditioner Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Conditioner. If you use and like the former, you will like this one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo and the matching conditioner Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner both have a heavenly scent, which lasts on my hair all day if I let my hair dry naturally. It&#x27;s just a fabulously Moroccan spicy scent, which lingers and it is totally relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I also love is that this shampoo and matching conditioner help my dry ends, but they don&#x27;t weigh down the rest of my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to help my coloring looking more fresh for longer. I&#x27;d highly recommend it for someone with a similiar hair type or for someone who loves a richly scented shampoo.</li>
    <li> I never really understood all the hullabaloo about color care shampoos and conditioners but would incorporate them into my hair care whenever I had a nice coloring.  They seemed gentle enough as to not attack my color, but failed to stand out otherwise.  This shampoo also protects color, but also throws in all the benefits of this Moroccan miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will feel amazing.  This leads for super-soft hair that will last between shampoos (something I never saw the Suave line doing).  This cleans without residue or drying, and yes, color looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For extra miraculous softening, use the companion conditioner.</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful! My hair is very soft and with an incredible shine! Opreço is very good! I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple weeks now. Overall i am happy with it, but this is not a shampoo for everyone...&lt;br /&gt;What do i mean by that? Basically the scent while applying is pretty overwhelming (think heavy perfume) so unless you like the smell (which i personally did) it can be a major pain. The smell doesnt last more than an hour on your hair after showering though so there is that.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise i love how quick and easy it lathers up, and makes my hair feel nice and clean.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for awhile and it does a great job of cleaning the hair. It feels really good after using it. It seems to work about the same as other moderate level shampoos.  It is not salon quality but it is not the cheapest either. It does have a good scent. I couldn&#x27;t really notice any extra shine from the Moroccan oil. So if you are looking for a moderate priced shampoo that works you may try this one as Suave put out a decent product as usual with this one.</li>
    <li> As someone who can only wash her hair 2-3 times a week (or it dries out horribly), I&#x27;m willing to spend a little on shampoo. However, thanks to the Suave Professionals, I really don&#x27;t have to. The Moroccan Infusion line has joined the Keratin line in my repertoire. It smells nice, lathers and rinses out well and (when used with the conditioner) leaves my hair very clean and soft. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. We often buy Suave, but had never tried this version before. It&#x27;s unique ingredient, and nice smell comes from the inclusion of the Moroccan argan oil. I suppose it&#x27;s been around for a while but has lately become very popular, valued for its nutritive, medicinal and cosmetic properties. It strikes me as a new \\&quot;tea tree oil\\&quot; type product, that is claimed to be good for a lot of things. I don&#x27;t know much about it, other than it smells nice and keeps my hair (and my wife&#x27;s hair) smooth and shiny, without being oily. The pleasant smell lingers throughout the day, without being overpowering at all. My daughter, who has died her hair a few times, and now has it red, likes to use this version. Her colored hair tends to dull a bit over time and this does seem to help to keep it vibrant. We&#x27;ve used it along with the conditioner, and it works great. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> Since I color my hair, I am always trying to find shampoo and conditioner that will allow me to keep my hair color shiny and soft (and lasting). I tried the shampoo/conditioner combo for 2 weeks since coloring my hair and do not notice anything different from the expensive brand that I was previously using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo cleans nicely and smells good. If you are looking for a \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; alternative for colored hair, this might do the trick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and the conditioner of the same product line for a couple of weeks now and I like it. I use about a nickel-sized dollop of shampoo on my shoulder-length fine, dry hair and it works into a luscious lather that smells vaguely musky but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do color my hair at home using a variety of products, and that process leaves my hair a bit more dry than usual. Add to it the fact that it is winter and that results in my hair needing some intensive care and moisture. I want clean, soft, smooth hair without static or flyaway ends. Also don&#x27;t want a greasy look that you sometimes can get using products made for processed hair. This shampoo works well for me and I am happy with the way my hair looks and feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My daughter &amp; I have two different types of hair. My short, baby fine hair  has no body; her long hair has some wave &amp; a medium texture. Neither of us  used  Suave products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the opportunity to review Suave Professionals Moroccan line of hair care products &amp; I&#x27;m very impressed with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Because my baby fine hair can be weighed down by some hair products, especially conditioners, I let my daughter test  [[ASIN:B00A0IWRRG Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Shampoo 28 oz]] &amp; [[ASIN:B00A0IWRUI Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner 28 oz]] first. She had great results; her hair was left shiny &amp; manageable after using  both the shampoo &amp; conditioner in Suave&#x27;s Professionals Moroccan line. She shampoos &amp; conditions her hair every other day, but was surprised that her hair was still reasonably shiny 24 hours after shampooing/conditioning. About once a week, she also uses the Shine Mask &amp; Styling Oil in this same line, &amp; has had great results. However, she thinks if she uses them (the oil &amp; the mask) too often they will cause a build-up. When I finally decided to try the shampoo &amp; conditioner, I was surprised that my hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down by the conditioner &amp; was left shiny too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the shampoo &amp; conditioner, both of us were left with shiny, manageable hair. Neither of us have developed product build-up yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review if my opinion changes. As it is right now, we both love the Suave Professionals Moroccan line of hair care products &amp; will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> I had better luck with the Color Care type of this shampoo, then I did with the Shine shampoo. This one still has the nice fragrance-although a little strong for my taste. Just a tiny bit of shampoo gave me loads of lather. I barely put any conditioner on the ends of my hair. This made my color treated hair shiny and there was no flatness this time. Reasonable price...try it.</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical about the \\&quot;argon oil\\&quot; promise, as it seems just like the \\&quot;shea butter\\&quot;, \\&quot;avocado oil\\&quot;, and \\&quot;olive oil\\&quot; supplements offered in this same products over the last few years.  It seems like a trendy ingredient and not necessarily beneficial.  I&#x27;ve rec&#x27;d face lotions and even hand cream with argon oil, so it&#x27;s everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I was very impressed with this product.  It made a nice lather that rinsed fast and my hair (despite hard water) didn&#x27;t feel like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The use of the conditioner really polished it off. The two work well together. I had light, full hair, no tangles, and no greasy feel like an \\&quot;oil\\&quot; might make you think of.</li>
    <li> Most Color Protection/Restorative Shampoos are very heavy and meant to put some more moisture back into color-damaged hair. This shampoo isn&#x27;t as heavy as most of these kinds of shampoos, but it does make your hair feel less dry. I have been using it for a few weeks now, and I have to say, I actually think my hair has more body and is softer- usually color-damage shampoos are so heavy they weigh your hair down. Now, my hair is only mildly highlighted, so really damaged hair might find this shampoo to not be enough (although in combination with the conditioner, it would undoubtedly do more for you). For me, this was the perfect amount of color care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell, however, is what will keep me coming back. It is this beautiful sweet but spicy Moroccan scent that I absolutely love. It is fabulous! And I can smell it all day long. Love it! But it is kind of powerful, so if you don&#x27;t like heavy scent in your shampoo, this won&#x27;t be for you.</li>
    <li> I never expect much from drugstore brands. I&#x27;ve had too many of them disappoint me. I certainly didn&#x27;t expect to fall in love with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long, straight, fine textured but there&#x27;s a lot of it, color-treated, and while I suffer from very oily roots the rest of it is dry. I have to shampoo and condition every day. Or rather, I did until I started using Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Shampoo. Seriously. I had been using it for about a week and decided I&#x27;d skip a shampoo because it was so cold out (and blow drying really hurts my hair) and didn&#x27;t want to go to bed with wet hair. It didn&#x27;t look or feel dirty so I figured I&#x27;d suffer with the greasies in the morning but the following evening my hair was only a little oily around the roots! So for the past few weeks I&#x27;ve been only shampooing and conditioning every other night. Still no greasies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a shampoo that made my hair this balanced and I am loving only shampooing every other night. It&#x27;s giving my scalp a much needed break from constant cleansing and I&#x27;m hoping that over time it will let my hair grow out much less damaged. As far as color care is concerned, I&#x27;m not noticing any stripping and am honestly due for a recolor, my roots are very much showing. I will update this review down the road once I&#x27;ve recolored and given this further use to see how it&#x27;s doing for longer then a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I absolutely love this shampoo and will probably keep using it as long as it gives me that every-other-night washing priveledge. If you would love the same I recommend giving it a try!</li>
    <li> I would like to say I love this shampoo, but I can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the shampoo works great on my hair and makes it very soft and easy to work with out of the shower, the scent is too strong for me.  I find I cannot continue to use it!  I try, but the scent turns my stomach.  I used it daily for over week and I did notice a difference in my hair.  It lathers up nice and even when not using a conditioner, it made my hair very soft and easier to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the shampoo works and works well.  Unfortunately, I just can&#x27;t handle the scent.</li>
    <li> I will admit I was never a fan of Suave hair care products, but Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Shampoo isn&#x27;t bad at all. Like all Suave products, it is priced less than most shampoos. Unlike most Suave products, this shampoo didn&#x27;t dry my hair out and make it feel like straw. It has a pleasant smell, which isn&#x27;t too strong. It leaves my hair soft, and smelling good. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to the \\&quot;Moroccan argan oil\\&quot;, but this Suave Shampoo just does a good job, especially for the price. I can recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been impressed with the Suave Moroccan line of products. While Suave has a (well deserved) reputation for cheap products, this does not feel like cheap shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is concentrated rather than being watery. It lathers up nicely in my hard water. The scent is pleasant and it left my hair clean and ready for conditioning. I did try comb out my hair after shampooing one day to do a conditioning mask. It was too tangly to do that without the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled with this shampoo/conditioner! I had already tried one of the other sets from this Moroccan line, and it had too strong a smell for me. Otherwise, I loved how it made my hair feel. With this one, my hair still feels wonderfully soft, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about that strong smell. This one has a somewhat coconut smell. I&#x27;m a big fan of the coconut smell, so it was perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased!</li>
