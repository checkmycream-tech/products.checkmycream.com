      <li>I wanted &amp;#34;mermaid hair&amp;#34; and I have achieved it with this product. :D</li>
      <li>I recommend you wait 10-15 minutes for it to heat up for its&#x27; best performance on your hair!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m impressed with it.</li>
      <li>it works very great</li>
      <li>On the hottest setting I styled each section for 15 seconds and it worked perfectly.</li>

      <li>I&#x27; very glad I bought this!</li>
      <li>but it worked great</li>

      <li>This is a great waver.  </li>

      <li>I really loved works great</li>
      <li>Great item so easy to use and gives you that perfect mermaid hair!!!  </li>
      <li>and it also had good reviews.</li>
      <li>It takes about 2 mins per bunch of hair to get a good crimp/wave</li>
      <li>So if you have a lot of hair &amp; want a good crimp, try looking for something else before you get this.</li>
      <li>I even had strangers coming up to ask me how I did it, and my husband loved it, so</li>
      <li>But is good quality and dual voltage</li>
      <li>I do put it on the highest temp, which I know isn&#x27;t good</li>

      <li>I LOVE THIS STYLE IRON!</li>
      <li>It was cute!</li>
      <li>SO amazing.</li>
      <li>--- just perfect -- with three barrels it takes no time to do your whole head --</li>
      <li>the kind of hair you have.</li>
      <li>, it heats up fast and makes perfect waves and its very easy to use.</li>
      <li>product is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>I would&#x27;ve liked more room on the barrels b/c my hair got stuck in the hinge once.  </li>
      <li>its always easy to use and everyone tells me how nice it looks when i use it.</li>
      <li>This cheap price does not indicate cheap quality --- There are many crimp/waiver irons out there that are much more money than this one -- but this one is awesome --- the barrel size it perfect --- not too small to make your hair look frizzy</li>
      <li>I was originally looking to buy a crimper, but I like this a lot better!</li>
      <li>I really like this works great</li>
      <li>I love my triple barrel waver -</li>
      <li>I love my triple barreled waver.</li>
      <li>so i have pix!)Idid crimp most of my hair so thats why it got SOO volumous</li>
      <li>If you find that you want more hold and fullness, you might want to try using a mousse volumizer...</li>
      <li>If you accidentally clamp over any hair that&#x27;s already been waved, you&#x27;re going to get more of a crimping effect than you probably want.</li>
      <li>Maybe spray would be better...</li>
      <li>It can be challenging to line up the waves horizontally and vertically.</li>
      <li>O WELL STILL LOVE IT...</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>I love how it makes my hair look.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that this iron works great on my hair.</li>
      <li>It gives you soft waves that a great change from the curlin gor straightning iron.</li>
      <li>i saw this product on tv (the Real World) and loved how the hair looked on one of the girls.</li>
      <li>I was very happy with my purchase,it gets very hot and the curls last all day unless its raining of course</li>
      <li>I love this iron so much makes gorges waves I really love it!</li>
      <li>look, it might seem like an easy thing to do...</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s unacceptable  and could have easily been avoided if the seller would&#x27;ve just plugged the damn thing in and checked it before shipping.</li>
      <li>This iron works good, very hot, the barrels aren&#x27;t as big as I hoped but did a good job helping me try to get the 20&#x27;s hair wave look.</li>
      <li>The cord is nice and long and swivels which is always a good feature.  </li>
      <li>This was fine with me because it worked with the style I wanted, but might be something for you to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For someone like me who&#x27;s hair is not naturally curly, it creates great \\&quot;party or date hair\\&quot; but it may not be office appropriate.  </li>
      <li>and I have medium to fine hair.</li>
      <li>It heats up really quickly quickly too!</li>
      <li>I have had it for a few weeks now and it works great!</li>
      <li>The waves look fabulous.</li>
      <li>the indicator light doesn&#x27;t turn on and the iron doesn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
      <li>I bought this one because it was relatively cheap, although I was hesitant because it did not have temperature control.</li>
      <li>I use it at the low setting for less damage to my hair and it does the job perfectly... amazing!</li>
      <li>Still looks cute, just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had in mind.</li>
      <li>There is a cool tip to hold at the end of the iron</li>
      <li>All of the listed information was correct and shopping was fast :)</li>
      <li>Our granddaughter loved this present at Christmas.  </li>
      <li>So....it crimps/waves quickly.</li>
      <li>WILL BE SUPER GLUING IT BECAUSE YOU CAN BURN YOUR HAND ON THE GOLD</li>
      <li>Heats up quick, the curls are glorious.</li>
      <li>Definitely a good buy and worth the extra money!</li>
      <li>I have fine, utterly straight hair that won&#x27;t hold a curl.  </li>
      <li>I have very thick hair, so it makes sense that it doesn&#x27;t work that great, but it still gives it a wavy look, which is cute, too.</li>
      <li>It only has a low/high switch, &amp; it kind of takes awhile to heat up,</li>
      <li>This Waver is awesome, i used it on my hair for new years last year and it held the entire night.</li>
      <li>I had previously purchases a waver with MUCH larger barrels ( Revlon Perfect Heat 3 Barrel</li>
      <li>My curls were very shiny, bouncy and full of body, and the curls have lasted for 2 days.  </li>
      <li>It was a little smaller than I was expecting, but it works great!  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised with how easy to hold and wave this iron is.</li>
      <li>It got to my house super fast</li>
      <li>Goes very fast; the waves hold.  </li>
      <li>I have pretty fine hair that is naturally wavy.</li>
      <li>Be willing to set some time aside to use it though.</li>
      <li>doesnt get too hot at all</li>
      <li>so I knew that this would work for me provided the iron got hot</li>
      <li>one gets hot fast and creates beautiful, long lasting waves.</li>
      <li>the first day i wore my hair after using this i got about 50 compliments.</li>
      <li>There are only 2 heat settings and I would like more choices.</li>
      <li>PIPING HOT....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There is about a minute waiting time for ready for use. It heats up slowly.&lt;br /&gt;Curl comes out okay but not the way you would think it would be. It&#x27;s really a thin curl.</li>
    <li> I was looking to buy a waver/crimper for sometime. Decided to just order this one from amazon since I only had to pay $3.99 for overnight shipping with amazon prime and it also had good reviews. It definately does the job, but I highly suggest have some gel or mousse dried in your hair first to help hold the crimper and to get it to crimp faster. It takes about 2 mins per bunch of hair to get a good crimp/wave and I have medium to fine hair. I do put it on the highest temp, which I know isn&#x27;t good but I use heat protection spray. I am happy with product.</li>
    <li> I have very curl-resistant hair which I recently cut into a chin-length bob. I bought this because curling irons utterly perplex me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very easy to use. It gets SUPER hot on the hottest setting, much hotter than my curling iron or my flat iron. You just pick a section of hair, clamp it on and hold it (the sectioning/clamping phase is just like with a flat iron but you just hold it in place instead of moving it). I used it on the longest layers framing my face and it gave me a great updated 30&#x27;s finger wave kind of effect. Just what I was looking for! On the hottest setting I styled each section for 15 seconds and it worked perfectly. Before leaving the house I misted on a little hairspray and the waves lasted all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two caveats: 1) I tried using it on my shorter layers in back and that didn&#x27;t work quite as well. I&#x27;m not sure if this is because I couldn&#x27;t see the back of my head or if 4 inches is just too short for use with this. It did make the shorter layers kind of wavy but not as wavy as the front, and they didn&#x27;t last quite as long. This was fine with me because it worked with the style I wanted, but might be something for you to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It can be challenging to line up the waves horizontally and vertically. If you accidentally clamp over any hair that&#x27;s already been waved, you&#x27;re going to get more of a crimping effect than you probably want.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t respond, I have been trying to return this item and they won&#x27;t get back to you!</li>
    <li> This cheap price does not indicate cheap quality --- There are many crimp/waiver irons out there that are much more money than this one -- but this one is awesome --- the barrel size it perfect --- not too small to make your hair look frizzy --- just perfect -- with three barrels it takes no time to do your whole head -- I leave some straighter pieces underneath and this creates a very nice contrast -- I usually don&#x27;t take the time to write a review but I just wanted people to know --- great buy --- I would buy it as a gift for others</li>
    <li> I usually use Hot Tools, but I was given this iron to me by a friend. I have long, thick, won&#x27;t hold a curl, dry, asian hair. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this iron works great on my hair. I have used the Vidal Sasson one before (shudder) and it did not work well on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one gets hot fast and creates beautiful, long lasting waves. Definitely a good buy and worth the extra money!</li>
    <li> I am a hairdresser. I bought this based on reviews.  It was HORRIBLE.  Did NOT &#x27;hold curl&#x27; - did NOT &#x27;produce tight waves that lasted for days&#x27; - it was limp and what little WAS there, fell out in 30 minutes.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I had owned a pair of these before that I got from a beauty supply store and this time I ordered them online because they were cheaper. They are great quality and for a great price.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all. I have short hair and I really think it depends on the texture of your hair BC it just frizzed mine up.</li>
    <li> It works great! Be willing to set some time aside to use it though. Takes like 30min. for me and my hair&#x27;s only shoulder length.</li>
    <li> I have long and very thick hair that is slightly wavy but not enough for a good curl so I usually just straighten it.  I am bored with the flat straight look and wanted something different and more exciting for evening.  This waver certainly delivered.  The look it created was unique and fun and very different from my usual daytime look.  The waver heats up fast, creates defined waves, and adds a lot of body and fullness to my hair.  My curls were very shiny, bouncy and full of body, and the curls have lasted for 2 days.  There is a cool tip to hold at the end of the iron so you can stabilize the tool and you won&#x27;t get burned.  The grip is comfortable and the tool is not too heavy - my hand did not get tired holding the tool even though it took a long time to completely curl my whole head.  The cord is nice and long and swivels which is always a good feature.  And the iron did not seem to burn my hair even though I used the high setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that brings me to the negatives.  There are only 2 heat settings and I would like more choices. I color treat my hair and probably shouldn&#x27;t use the high setting all the time.  My biggest complaint is the barrels are a little too short.  I would&#x27;ve liked more room on the barrels b/c my hair got stuck in the hinge once.  It also does not have an automatic shut off which really should be on all heated styling devices for safety.  And I think the curls may be a little too tight for everyday, so I wish the barrels were a little larger.  For someone like me who&#x27;s hair is not naturally curly, it creates great \\&quot;party or date hair\\&quot; but it may not be office appropriate.  And lastly, if you have a lot of long hair like I do, this is really not a tool for everyday.  It took me about an hour to curl my entire head.  I got a ton of compliments though.  I even had strangers coming up to ask me how I did it, and my husband loved it, so I&#x27;ll definitely keep this for evenings out or special occasions.</li>
    <li> This iron works good, very hot, the barrels aren&#x27;t as big as I hoped but did a good job helping me try to get the 20&#x27;s hair wave look.</li>
    <li> I have fine, utterly straight hair that won&#x27;t hold a curl.  Until now.  My hair is so fine, and it gets so hot, I only use the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting and hold each section of hair for only 8-20 seconds, tops.  Goes very fast; the waves hold.  If I want fullness w/o visible waves, I pin up the to section of each side of my hair and just wave the under layers.  Works great. I&#x27; very glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> I have long straight hair and normal cheap curling irons do not work on my hair (my hair doesnt hold the curls for more than 30 min) i saw this product on tv (the Real World) and loved how the hair looked on one of the girls. This Waver is awesome, i used it on my hair for new years last year and it held the entire night. it took me an hour to do my entire head but it worked great and i didnt have to hold it very long (about 30 seconds each hold, i know that may be long for some people i thought it was reasonable)</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and I spend lots of time putting it in braids to have a wave effect. No longer, 20 minutes with this iron and my hair is wavy and not frizzy.</li>
    <li> I had one of these types of irons before and it was terrible but this one is simply amazing! It works great and I love the look that it creates! It got to my house super fast and I could not be happier!</li>
    <li> I had been searching several different ones. these waves are small...i was wanting deeper waves...but it didn&#x27;t say anything about deep waves for this product so that&#x27;s my fault. so, very small waves almost crimp look...and i can&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair because it becomes one big fluff. Maybe spray would be better...but i don&#x27;t like to put chemicals in my hair...so i have not tryed that.</li>
    <li> I really like this waver, i had read all the reviews on it, and was a little worried, since there are a few bad reviews, but it works great on me!! I have thin hair that doesnt hold curl and falls flat, but this adds great volume, and holds the wave all day! And it doesnt take long to do, i usually leave it on 15-25 seconds a piece... im happy... :-)</li>
    <li> I have had it for a few weeks now and it works great! I recommend you wait 10-15 minutes for it to heat up for its&#x27; best performance on your hair! I have natural curly hair (sort of like beach waves and kinks), I use it for the pieces that lack a little curl. I also use it the day after sleeping on my hair. Sometimes my curls get a little whacky, and this makes them look a lot better with just little time!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STYLE IRON! the first day i wore my hair after using this i got about 50 compliments. It creates natural looking waves that last for days! All i gotta do is style my hair once and it stays like that for the next three days. the person who wrote that nasty review must have been impatient and refused to hold it for a reasonable amount of time. VERY GOOD QUALITY! it heats up super fast and is very durable. looks natural and is way worth the money. its great! ive never loved a styling tool more!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my purchase,it gets very hot and the curls last all day unless its raining of course</li>
    <li> I have color treated hair...I use it at the low setting for less damage to my hair and it does the job perfectly... amazing!</li>
    <li> I honestly love big, wild hair...but this product added inches of volume to my mane. even with heat protector and a little hairspray my normally flat, limp hair looked like i just got a perm, in san antonio with 80% humidity(i went out that night so i have pix!)Idid crimp most of my hair so thats why it got SOO volumous but if i hadnt it would have looked even wierder. so it did take a lot of time to style. and it burned my hair too. i used heat protector but it didnt seem to help alot. I may try to use it again maybe at halloween or i may buy the version with bigger waves. I was just sad because i thought it would tame my hair and give it a styled wave...but anyway my hair is naturally frizzy and has a little little wave of its own so maybe it works better with other hair types.</li>
    <li> I ordered a Conair, not this knock off so needless to say, I am not happy that I got stuck with this :/</li>
    <li> This waver is definatly a fun new way to do your hair. I was originally looking to buy a crimper, but I like this a lot better! It gives you soft waves that a great change from the curlin gor straightning iron. It heats up really quickly quickly too!</li>
    <li> I love my triple barreled waver. it works very great but i thought it would&#x27;ve been bigger. I use it a lot of different occasions &amp; events. its always easy to use and everyone tells me how nice it looks when i use it. Thank you</li>
    <li> Recieved iron, barley would heat up and would hardly do anything to my hair. Sent back and had to go through SO much to get my money back. Won&#x27;t be buying from here again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time on my hair and this product is an easy way to fix my hair when I want to style it different and don&#x27;t want to spend forever curling it with hot rollers or a curling iron.</li>
    <li> it curls but you have to keep it up there for a longer period of time. doesnt get too hot at all</li>
    <li> Piece arrived with black thumb shield cracked and loose in box....beginning return process now.</li>
    <li> I love this iron so much makes gorges waves I really love it! SO amazing. It makes your hair a bit puffy when using it though.</li>
    <li> I love it!! The crimper works perfectly and quickly. All of the listed information was correct and shopping was fast :)</li>
    <li> I love my triple barrel waver - I use it all the time!  I don&#x27;t know what I ever did without it! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for smooth, defined waves.</li>
    <li> Not worth buying- doesn&#x27;t heat to hot enough -and waited 3 weeks for delivery! Waste of money</li>
    <li> Great item so easy to use and gives you that perfect mermaid hair!!!  I am so happy I bought this one everyone goes crazy over my hair when I style it with this.  Would definitely recommend to my friends to buy this!!!  I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Heats up quick, the curls are glorious. I am very happy with this curler. I wanted &amp;#34;mermaid hair&amp;#34; and I have achieved it with this product. :D</li>
    <li> In order to curl hair I had to turn the heat way up and then it was damaging hair, even when used with heat product so I was afraid to hold it in place too long and then the curl was not a pretty, wavy curl.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair, so it makes sense that it doesn&#x27;t work that great, but it still gives it a wavy look, which is cute, too. It only has a low/high switch, &amp; it kind of takes awhile to heat up, but like I said it works pretty well, just not enough heatfor my thick old hair. It would take me a while for me to do it the way is want, like  an hour &amp; maybe plus. So if you have a lot of hair &amp; want a good crimp, try looking for something else before you get this.</li>
    <li> I really loved works great</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as expected. Takes very long and makes hair look frizzy and awful. Seriously a waste of money. DO NOT buy this product made by this or any other company.</li>
    <li> You must get.. You won&#x27;t be sorry..</li>
    <li> I thought it was bigger, but instead it was very tiny, so if I curl my hair with it I look like a poodle.... But is good quality and dual voltage</li>
    <li> This product is defective. Takes forever to heat up and produces little to no wave or curl. You&#x27;re better off using a flat iron to create curls.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the rundown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product&#x27;s value is dependent on two things: 1) the users ability to work the iron...look, it might seem like an easy thing to do...but it isn&#x27;t really. Especially when wavers are concerned it DOES take a bit of talent getting used to. Don&#x27;t just use it once and then make a judgement, you need to get used to how to hold and use thing iron. 2) the kind of hair you have. The level of oil, dryness, limpness, thickness etc...all these things factor in to how this iron will work for you. I have pretty fine hair that is naturally wavy. It DOES hold curl very well so I knew that this would work for me provided the iron got hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;The iron has two heat settings: High and Low. I use the high setting and it works for me. It goes get pretty darn hot, but I found that I only leave to need it on any section for about 6 seconds or so. So....it crimps/waves quickly. You have to be able to match up the waves and it can get a little difficult when doing the back of your head but, practice helps with that.&lt;br /&gt;It adds a lot of volume (which is why I got it) and it holds for me for about 2 days including being slept on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waver itself is a sturdy little thing. I&#x27;m impressed with it. Of course, as with all irons, take care that you are careful with it. If the spring on the clamp goes...it&#x27;s worthless. I had previously purchases a waver with MUCH larger barrels ( Revlon Perfect Heat 3 Barrel Deep Waver Styling Curling Iron ) and although it worked okay, the barrels were bigger and it was large and so clunky to work with. I was pleasantly surprised with how easy to hold and wave this iron is. I really like it. It does have a little iron stand that prevents the iron from hitting any surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a heat guard on my hair before blow drying and using the waver, but nothing else. If you find that you want more hold and fullness, you might want to try using a mousse volumizer...although beware, mousses typically will dryout hair and make it brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;remember, practice with this is key! once you get the hang of it, it goes MUCH quicker.</li>
    <li> This waver works well. It heats up fast and gives a long lasting wave... But, they are more like crimps, not waves, since the barrels are so small. It should be labeled &amp;#34;Crimper&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;Waver&amp;#34;. Just beware and know what you are looking for when you buy this product. I even have long hair. Still looks cute, just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had in mind.</li>
    <li> I owned this product for 6 months and I fell one time and broke into two !! I called belson products and they said it wasn&#x27;t cover under warranty... Sorry you have to buy a new one.., I&#x27;m not... They just lost a customer..</li>
    <li> I love how it makes my hair look. But I have only used it 3 times since I bought it and it broke on me. the clip that makes it move up and down is dis-positioned. So now its totally worthless.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse African American hair. I wear it relaxed. Prior to this I used old-school crimp tool for the stove. That worked well.The style However I kept damgaging my hair. I searched for six months for an electric crimper/waver that would provide enough heat. I bought this one because it was relatively cheap, although I was hesitant because it did not have temperature control. But it worked well using small sections of hair.  The waves look fabulous. I wrap my hair is a silk cap every night and they seem to be lasting (3 days). It took me along time to do my hair because it is long and thick. I used a non-alcoholic mousse for hold and heat protection. I would recommend this product. Also you can buy it at Sally and return it if you do not like it.</li>
    <li> I really like this works great, it heats up fast and makes perfect waves and its very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was concerned that it would not be hot enough because it did not have the adjustable heat setting, but it does get hot and make a soft wave that last a few days.  It also makes the hair silky and shinny.</li>
    <li> the iron arrived and i immediately plugged it in to try it out. the indicator light doesn&#x27;t turn on and the iron doesn&#x27;t heat up. it&#x27;s obviously defective and to me that&#x27;s unacceptable  and could have easily been avoided if the seller would&#x27;ve just plugged the damn thing in and checked it before shipping. now I&#x27;m going to have to go through the whole runaround of filing a claim, shipping it back and waiting for a replacement - assuming they even cooperate with me. I&#x27;m pissed.</li>
    <li> This is a great waver.  It was a little smaller than I was expecting, but it works great!  I really like the handle at the end of the barrels.</li>
    <li> ALREADY HAD THIS FOR 10 YEARS PREVIOS TO PURCHASING IT NORMAL WEAR AND TARE....BUT I FOIND THIS ON HERE AND GOT IT...&lt;br /&gt;FAST DELIVERY...MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS IT WAS CRACKED WHEN DELIVERED TODAY...PROBABLY FROM THEM SLINGING ON MY POARCH RATHER THAN PLACING THE BOX DOWN...O WELL STILL LOVE IT...WILL BE SUPER GLUING IT BECAUSE YOU CAN BURN YOUR HAND ON THE GOLD PART...ITS GETS PIPING HOT....LOVE IT THANKS.... RECOMMEND. FOR NATRUAL TO STRAIGHT HAIR....BEAUTIFUL CRIMP.</li>
    <li> This waver was WAYY smaller than I had anticipated. I bought it to make waves in my hair, and though it did the job quickly, I ended up looking more like I had a bad perm. Unless you&#x27;re looking to do your hair for an eighties party, I&#x27;d avoid this one.</li>
    <li> Our granddaughter loved this present at Christmas.  She fixed her sister&#x27;s hair using it and showed us the result.  It was cute!</li>
