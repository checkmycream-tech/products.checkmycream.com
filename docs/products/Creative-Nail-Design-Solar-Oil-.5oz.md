### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Great oil, smells good!</li>
      <li>This works great</li>
      <li>A great product.</li>
      <li>I am extremely happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>great for moisturizing cuticles</li>
      <li>I was actually able to grow my nails out to about a quarter inch of tip length (which is impressive for my nails) before they started bothering me</li>
      <li>It smells pleasant, too - like almond oil.</li>
      <li>To be fair, since I&#x27;ve started using this I have also been keeping polish on my nails and changing it out once per week, which I think is also helping.</li>
      <li>and when they were advised that the bottle was shattered they refused to make good on the purchase.  </li>
      <li>I was not expecting this to smell so good.</li>
      <li>smells good and works for my cuticles.</li>
      <li>and I am really satisfied with the results!</li>
      <li>and I love the smell!  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this cuticle oil, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great item to leave in your purse and put on your cuticles when you have free time.</li>
      <li>I love that it isn&#x27;t oily and is very easy to brush on.</li>
      <li>I am using Solar oil for many years.</li>
      <li>way* better already.</li>
      <li>Love this solar oil.  </li>
      <li>It is excellent for nourishing my yellow, brittle, flaking nails.  </li>
      <li>It was yet another promise of healthy nails.  </li>
      <li>My natural nails have never looked so good!  </li>
      <li>Daily use gives me beautiful cuticles and no cracked skin.</li>
      <li>I wish I could give it 3.5 stars, cause it is a GOOD product, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s GREAT.</li>
      <li>This price is great because my local nail salon sells it for $17 per bottle.</li>
      <li>When used daily this product keeps my nails in great condition and I don&#x27;t even feel the need to polish them.  </li>
      <li>but I can see healthy nail growth for the first time in years.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been putting it on every night or every other night and my nails and cuticles look great.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ll go back to solar oil as they seem to be interested in making certain that their product arrives safely and in good order.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this Solar Oil for several months now and love it!</li>
      <li>Within the first week my nails looked healthier.  </li>
      <li>I first purchased this product after a manicure.  </li>
      <li>so I looked at my empty bottle and got the email address and ordered my own.  </li>
      <li>pun intended ;-)</li>
      <li>I tried a couple of other ones before this one, and this one is hands down the best...</li>
      <li>Exactly as described and delivered fast.</li>
      <li>Not expecting much, I decided to purchased my first bottle.  </li>
      <li>My nails look great; they are still very short because of the previous peeling</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;ve had the bottle leak twice, which has really diminished my rating of the product.</li>
      <li>It has really helped my nails to grow and repair my cuticles.</li>
      <li>I really like the oil.  </li>
      <li>and my nails are so much healthier just after applying this once or twice a day for a couple weeks.</li>
      <li>I tried so many other products that I had just about given up.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve always just kept them super short.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It brings dry, brittle fingernails and toenails back to a healthy finish.  </li>
      <li>A winter time must use product for when you live in Michigan.</li>
      <li>This is great for a shellac manicure - use it daily - and the shellac will last for almost a month - at least mine does!</li>
      <li>My nails are soft, brittle and split and peel.  </li>
      <li>Not helping my dry cuticles as much as I would like.</li>
      <li>I continued to buff shine the pealing areas and by the next week the peeling had stopped completely.  </li>
      <li>No one wants a greasy mess.</li>

    <li> I have horrible nails. I always have. I take multi-vitamins, I&#x27;ve tried biotin and I eat well, but I have horrible nails. They are thin and peel like crazy so I&#x27;ve always just kept them super short. I bought this on a whim since I was buying nail polish from the same brand and I am really satisfied with the results! I&#x27;ve been putting it on every night or every other night and my nails and cuticles look great. I was actually able to grow my nails out to about a quarter inch of tip length (which is impressive for my nails) before they started bothering me so I clipped them again. To be fair, since I&#x27;ve started using this I have also been keeping polish on my nails and changing it out once per week, which I think is also helping. In any case, if you have bad nails give this a try. It smells pleasant, too - like almond oil.</li>

    <li> I first purchased this product after a manicure.  It is excellent for nourishing my yellow, brittle, flaking nails.  It can be applied over nail polish.</li>
    <li> never again!  while i do like the oil, the company did not package it well and when they were advised that the bottle was shattered they refused to make good on the purchase.  i&#x27;ll go back to solar oil as they seem to be interested in making certain that their product arrives safely and in good order.  NEVER AGAIN!  a cheap envelope and a broken bottle results in an unsatisfied customer.</li>
    <li> smells good and works for my cuticles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Solar Oil for several months now and love it! I removed my acrylics that I&#x27;d had for years and used this at least 3 times a day for about a month and now once daily for upkeep.  My natural nails have never looked so good!  This price is great because my local nail salon sells it for $17 per bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this solar oil.  It has done wonders for my dry cuticles, especially during colder weather.  I apply is every night and haven&#x27;t been disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have used the oil for 2 years and my local source, which is the only place in our town that sells it, was out before Christmas  and&lt;br /&gt;when I went back after Christmas they still had not ordered any so I looked at my empty bottle and got the email address and ordered my own.  I really like the oil.  My nails are soft, brittle and split and peel.  It has helped and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> A winter time must use product for when you live in Michigan. Daily use gives me beautiful cuticles and no cracked skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days, but I can already tell a difference! My cuticles look *way* better already.</li>
    <li> I am using Solar oil for many years. Great product!</li>
    <li> My nails were horrible! They were peeling at least 1/4&amp;#34; from the edge back.  I tried so many other products that I had just about given up.  Then I read the reviews on CND Solar oil.  It was yet another promise of healthy nails.  Not expecting much, I decided to purchased my first bottle.  Within the first week my nails looked healthier.  I am not much for nail polish especially with short nails, so I have left my nails bare.  I continued to buff shine the pealing areas and by the next week the peeling had stopped completely.  My nails look great; they are still very short because of the previous peeling but I can see healthy nail growth for the first time in years.  It&#x27;s simple to apply and less expensive than many of the other products.  I am extremely happy with the results.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Not helping my dry cuticles as much as I would like.</li>
    <li> Great oil, smells good!</li>
    <li> I have awful nails. They are really thin and brittle. They peel and split terribly and it&#x27;s just awful. I have tried everything and finally I gave this a try and my nails are so much healthier just after applying this once or twice a day for a couple weeks. I should mention that I also started taking pre-natal vitamins.. but I feel like the combination of the two has been my miracle I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting this to smell so good. I love that it isn&#x27;t oily and is very easy to brush on. It&#x27;s a great item to leave in your purse and put on your cuticles when you have free time.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and delivered fast. Thanks</li>
