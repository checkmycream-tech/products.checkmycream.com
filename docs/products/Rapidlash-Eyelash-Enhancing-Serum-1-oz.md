<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazingly it does work! I ve been applying it for less than a week and my lashes are visibly longer. It&#x27;s even more obvious when you have mascara on. The only glitch is that you couldn&#x27;t apply eye cream at night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people say that their product is expired and returned it my answer to that is don&#x27;t!! This stuff is normally $50 and is a great price. I decided to apply it twice a day since maybe the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; of the lash serum diminished and alas! I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 4 weeks and I&#x27;ve seen amazing results!! My lashes are definitely more longer!!! I love it! Will contribute to use! Remember sometimes you just need to take a chance with beauty products!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with results. I see a little difference without makeup on, and when I wear mascara, wow. I&#x27;m amazed how long my lashes are.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried two other lash enhancers and I&#x27;ve been happiest with this one. Not only does it really work but it works fast! I noticed a difference in the first week of using it. The price is great too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the stuff for almost two months now and still have more in the tube. Nothing ever works for me - appetite surpressants, undereye dark circle treatments, brown spot remedies, etc.  Gotta say I was totally skeptical but this actually works! It took about a month but my lashes are definitely longer. Not thicker, but that&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;m using it now every other day and just ordered my second tube. No itching or loss of lashes. I&#x27;m VERY surprised.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! I use it nightly on my upper and lower lash lines and have recently started using it on my thinning eyebrows. Within two weeks of using it every day, I have seen more lash and brow growth and increased length. I also love that it does not cause any eye irritation.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  Amazing results with faithful use.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. The Rapidlash does everything it claims to do.  My lashes were falling out due to menopause (I guess)., anyway, when I&lt;br /&gt;Tried Rapidlash my lashes were back long and strong as ever. I have used this product. For about 2 years now, and it is amazing.</li>
    <li> Not much in the container the other which is the FEE HURTS my eyes waste of my money</li>
    <li> Product is wonderful and does exactly what it says it will do. Very happy with purchase.would for sure buy again</li>
    <li> This serum REALLY works.  I now have not only fuller and longer top lashes, but bottom lashes that you can actually see. I am absolutely thrilled with product and highly recommend,it  especially in view of its price (many other products cost more than $100) and the fact that shipping is fast and free.  I do not plan to ever be without it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and noticed that it was 6 months out of date. make sure you check the bottom of the bottle it does not say it on the packaging</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my eyebrows.  I see a difference already.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it would work similar to Lattesse (sp?) which I used previously with very good results. I especially liked the idea of the single wand brush applicator (like eyeliner) as opposed to the Lattisse which requires you to use a new brush out of their package--for each eye, and each time. The Lattesse brushes are also cheap and fat, difficult to apply the right amount of product only at the lash line. So, while I like the Rapidlash brush applicator which is also nice and thin, the product just didn&#x27;t work on me. I saw no improvement (lengthening, or thickening, or increased lashes) despite nightly use, as directed. In fact, my lashes seem to be falling out more frequently. (Not many, I just notice one or two falling out every week or so, but rarely ever saw a lash fall out before. The service was good, (although despite their shipping it in a padded envelope, the box was all smashed when it arrived--but the product inside the box wasn&#x27;t damaged. I&#x27;m sad that I can&#x27;t give this product a great review, as I was really hoping it would work. The price is MUCH better than Lattesse!</li>
    <li> After only a week, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference;  especially my eyebrows!  They have gotten so dark I don&#x27;t use any color on them.</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing! I have been using it for 6 weeks now (faithfully every night before bed) and WOW! My eyelashes are much longer and fuller and I am very happy with this product! I just purchased a 2nd tube as I used up the first one. This product truly works! It is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This really works. I also use it on my overplucked brows to fill them in.</li>
    <li> This a repeat buy.  I really like it.  I get compliments on my lashes all the time!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  At first I was a little impatient because I&#x27;m used to Latisse.  Latisse works within 4 weeks, but I didn&#x27;t want to spent $125 anymore, so I tried RapidLash.  RapidLash works well, but it takes about 4-6 weeks to start seeing results.  Be patient and use it EVERY NIGHT.  I felt that my lashes got longer and more natural looking where Latisse will make my lashes grow more corse and straight, sometimes my lashes even spring out in a straight angle rather than at a curve, which always annoyed me.  With RapidLash my lashes are soft and long.  I&#x27;m certainly sticking with this product, especially at the price (1/4 the cost of Latisse)...  .</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the eyelash enhancing serum was full.  Hardly any comes out on the applicator.  It was supposed to be in new condition.</li>
    <li> This does an amazing job!  My lashes got so long I had to trim them so they didn&#x27;t brush my glasses.  I&#x27;ve only been using it every other day and it still works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years.  It has improved the appearnace of my lashes for the most part.  Sometimes, it works very well and other times (other tubes I&#x27;ve purchased) don&#x27;t work at all.  The quality and effectiveness is somewhat inconsistent.  Still, at the price, it has been  mostly beneficial.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but I have been using this for a few months now and I&#x27;m a believer!&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to use and I had no side effects. It probably took a few weeks before I saw any results, but now everyone can see the difference. People think I am wearing false lashes, but I&#x27;m not! It had surpassed my expectations!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product.  I put it on in the eve before bed and after about 2weeks I saw a difference in the length of my eyelashes.  I am over 50 and as you age, your eyelashes diminish.  this product is a keeper.</li>
    <li> It really works! This is the second time I have purchased it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> It really does work..</li>
    <li> So disappointed. Didn&#x27;t give enough time to try out, doesn&#x27;t work. Should have stuck with LiLash. A little more expensive, it lasts forever and is tried and true</li>
    <li> The tunes of Rapid Lash only has 6 months before it expires.  I called to complain,  but the gal who took the call could care less. I am very disappointed about my purchase.</li>
    <li> After 2 months my short stubby eyelashes are actually starting to have a natural curl to them! It&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
    <li> very expensive but i have heard people have had great results. my problem is i wear waterproof mascara so that even after i wash my face my mascara stays on (my lashes are very blonde... i just have to wear mascara) the rapidlash has to be applied after all make-up is removed. it&#x27;s really just an issue of habit because i only remove my mascara before i shower then reapply the mascara... i have to get in the habit of removing my mascara at night so i can use the rapidlash nightly.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes were longer in just a few weeks!!</li>
    <li> It works so well. I love it</li>
    <li> I use this product religiously. I tint my lashes and rarely wear mascara anymore. Best product I have found and have been using it for several years. Also one of the best priced lash enhancing serums. Be advised that you need to use it for at least 30 days to see results and you must continue to use it (or any of these products) or your lashes revert to their original form. I replace my tube every 2 months.</li>
    <li> It works amazingly, but you have to be consistent and patient.</li>
    <li> This stuff works amazingly well.  I can&#x27;t believe how long my lashes are after a couple weeks of applying nightly.  I&#x27;m on my third bottle.  You have to keep up with it but it&#x27;s very impressive when you do.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes look the same</li>
    <li> Have been using this product on my eyelashes and eyebrows for almost one month, once per day before going to bed.  I always wash off all my face and eye makeup before applying.  I&#x27;ve noticed quite a bit of new growth in my previously sparse eyebrows, it even seems to be filling in some in a scar area!  As for my eyelashes, it&#x27;s hard to tell if they&#x27;ve gotten fuller or longer - they seem to be a bit fuller and longer, but I didn&#x27;t take a before pic so I&#x27;m not entirely sure.  I can&#x27;t tell how much is left in the container so am going to purchase another one - I like what it&#x27;s doing so far to my eyebrows and I don&#x27;t want to run out!  Will see how the next month works!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  Been using for over a year and my eyelashes are much longer and thicker.  Didn&#x27;t believe it would work but was given my first bottle by a friend.  Within a month, you will see results.  Keep using and it gets better.</li>
    <li> DO NOT! I repeat DO NOT use or buy this product or anything similar!  Google Rapidlash+deepening of upper eyelid sulcus+rapidlash. http://www.realself.com/review/buffalo-ny-latisse-careprost-my-eyes-sunken-hollow-periorbital-fat-atrophy (read this one too) You will see SO many women have lost fat in their upper eyelids and their eyes have SUNK into their face making them look older!  It is NOT worth the longer eyelashes.  Do not apply ANYWHERE on your face.  This happened to me!  I only used it for a week!  If you use this PLEASE discontinue use.  I&#x27;m hoping and praying that this reverses!  If this happened to you Please contact me lets build a class-action lawsuit as this isn&#x27;t listed as a possible reaction!  DONT DO IT LADIES I hope I can prevent this from happening to anyone else! :(</li>
    <li> I used to use revita lash, which worked fine for a few years and then it didnt. Maybe they changed the formula, anyway, then I tried Peter Thomas Roth and that was hopeless. I knew from using the Revita lash what these products could do so the Roth was useless and I used it for 6 months during which time my lashs became a mere shadow of their former selves.&lt;br /&gt;So, then I decided to use the Rapidlash ( had decent reviews and the price was right) and now after 6 weeks of use my lashes are starting to come back. When I use mascara they look great. It doesnt necessarily thicken the lashes but it certainly enlongates them and they look good.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it and of course, hope they dont change the formala in the near future.</li>
    <li> Not bad for 55 year old eyelashes</li>
    <li> Took a month to notice a difference and two months for everyone I knew to ask if I got eyelash extensions. One tube lasted three months using it almost once a day before bed. This is my first te trying an eyelash enhancing sirum and I love it!</li>
    <li> Been using Rapidlash faithfully since April the 12th. It&#x27;s now the 29th. I think it&#x27;s working.  Not 100% sure if it&#x27;s my imagination, but I think they&#x27;re longer. Esp at the very corner of my left eye. Ok, looked again with magnifying mirror-definetly longer. I&#x27;ve used this product b4 &amp; it has worked for me.</li>
    <li> no longer works.......this used to be a great product, but the last tube I bought, I have not seen ANY results. Niente.. I read that they had changed the ingredients; perhaps I&#x27;m wrong, but the bottom line is that it doesn&#x27;t do anything anymore.</li>
    <li> Although I bought this at the wholesale club it really works.  I had very few lashes left and very thin brows.  Dermatologist gave me a prescription for alpopecia that was very expensive.  As soon as I quit using it my lashes and brows fell out again.  With rapid lash I have such thick lashes I don&#x27;t have to wear mascara and only a little color  on my brows which continue to fill in.</li>
    <li> For my entire life, my lashes were, well....puny.  All the lengthening mascaras I tried didn&#x27;t help.  After using Rapid Lash for 2 weeks, I saw a noticeable difference in the length of my lashes.  I was already getting comments from my friends about how long my lashes looked.  After a month, I was hooked.  Aside from the spectacular results, the tube lasted for almost 5 months of everyday use. I&#x27;ve even converted two friends who were using Latisse. I use the brush to apply to the top of my lashes at the root, and then I use the wand to apply like mascara.  When I last purchased, I bought 2 tubes.  Amazing results and no hyperpigmentation problems.  I recently had Lasik, and this product didn&#x27;t bother my eyes after that either.</li>
    <li> WAS GIVEN  AS GIFT THAT SHE LIKED.</li>
    <li> I think I am allergic to this product. I used to use Latisse but wanted to try a cheaper product. I tried this &amp; woke up with red, irritated eyes. I think I am allergic to this product. I will have to go back to using Latisse.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with it because It was expired in April 2015 . I don&#x27;t have time to do all the return processing .</li>
    <li> This actually works! On brows too!</li>
    <li> seems to be working 4 weeks in, though nothing dramatic.  May come back and upgrade to a 5 star if results continue to get better.</li>
    <li> Really works to lengthen and thicken eyelashes.</li>
    <li> My eyebrow lady says she&#x27;s noticed a difference in my brows and that more hairs have grown. I&#x27;ve been using it about 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> Amazing product but I needed something stronger so I decided to try Royal Lashes. It worked great for me, I got mine from RoyalCosmetics.net</li>
    <li> I was down in Florida, shopping in  a Costco and came upon this.  I figured this stuff would be great versus me giving my hard earned cash to Mascara companies every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, i didn&#x27;t take into account - due to this being an impulse buy - that i have a sensitivity to several mascaras anyway.  If they aren&#x27;t hypo-allergenic, or non-allergenic (which is very expensive), i can&#x27;t use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to play it on the safe side, and put it on my eyebrows first.  If anything happened in that area, it wouldn&#x27;t be so &amp;#34;debilitating&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Well, let&#x27;s just say i&#x27;m glad i followed my first instincts.  I applied Rapid Lash to my eyebrows, with no problem for the first 24 hours.  The second night, i applied it, but kept feeling something weird going on with the upper eye lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I awakened that night to go to the porcelain palace, and just happened to see my upper eye lids and eyebrows cruising past the bathroom mirror before i realized they were standing out beyond my eyes and face.  The allergic reaction happened quick.  I immediately grabbed the soap, and started washing my brows and eyes.  The swelling began subsiding, and it took about a day or two of using packed ice before my eyebrows were back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that have any type of mascara sensitivity, i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea to use this product. I actually wanted it to work!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to see the results on this! I have short stubby and sparse lashes. I&#x27;m Korean and most of us were not gifted lashes. So I was skeptical but gave it a shot. I bought mine at Costco in a double pack and after abouy there weeks there they were! Lashes where I had never had lashes before! And the ones I did have were thicker and longer! And my eyebrows started to thicken up and darken too! No irritation or burning either. Which is what happened when I tried the MaryKay brand. I would definitely recommend this brand to everyone to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any change in my eyelashes...</li>
    <li> Product was shipped to me expired, was wondering why I wasn&#x27;t getting any results because normally this product is amazing. Waste of money!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this twice and I&#x27;m obsessed. I only bought it because of the great reviews I was reading online and didn&#x27;t really think much of it but after using it for a couple of weeks I really noticed a difference in my lashes!!! Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> It works descent, however it makes my eyelids very itch and irritated after applying. It was hard to keep my fingers off the eyelids</li>
    <li> It  works . I have used this for several yrs and it lasts for months. It has never caused me any problems</li>
    <li> This is one of those times I wish I had taken a before photo so that I could show what I started with to prove that this stuff does work and work great. I think I was not expecting it to work like it did.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully for about 5 months now once daily just before bed and I could not be happier.  I&#x27;m 55 and never in my life did I have eye lashes to brag about but late last year my lashes were short and stubby and I have no idea how they got that way.  I tried false eyelashes but could not manage them right, considered getting them done professionally, but chickened out, I ended up with a fairly pricy type of mascara that used a gel and fiber combo to build up my exiting lashes.  Epic fail.&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to Rapid Lash which I had no expectations but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  The instructions say to apply at the lash line twice daily for the first week then go to once a day. At first you wonder if you really are applying anything because the solution is clear and dries quickly. However, it feels cool going on so you know it&#x27;s there. One tube lasts approx 40 days or so.&lt;br /&gt;Results -  I started noticing growth about 2 1/2 weeks into using this serum and from there my lashes just blossomed. Not even in my youth did they look so good, at least as I recall.  I only have to use one coat of mascara on the tips and I&#x27;m ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;For me, Rapidlash with Hexatien Complex has been one of the few stand out personal products that I have tried.  I absolutely recommend  this serum.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 3 months and can really see the difference. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I see my eyelash a little bit longer than before after using this product. But if you stop using it, everything goes back to original.</li>
    <li> I have used lash enhancers for many years with great success.  I have had my lashes so long that they rub on my sun glass lenses.  I thought I would give this one a try this time. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as other lash enhancers that I have used.  My lashes may be a bit thicker, but not really any longer than they would be with no product at all.  It also makes my eyes burn for quite a while after application.</li>
    <li> Love it. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Made my eyelashes visibly longer and thicker, but not overboard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  When I get lazy or forget to apply it regularly I go back to short sparse lashes.</li>
    <li> have had my eye on this the entire time.</li>
    <li> been using since sept. 20 and it does work, love the product! Easy to apply. go to sleep and can see the eyelashes are longer and thicker</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I haven&#x27;t had miraculous results like some others have claimed, but I have noticed a difference.  My lashes are a little bit darker than they were, and they&#x27;re definitely longer and a bit thicker.  I haven&#x27;t had any problem with eye color changes as they warn about with other products, but I do have a little bit of skin discoloration on one lid.  It isn&#x27;t a big problem as I use shadow which covers it completely, and it is only a small area on one lid, but I felt I should mention that for those who don&#x27;t wear a primer or shadow that it is a possibility.  I did post another review for the Rapidbrow, but thought I&#x27;d mention here how great a product that is ... very noticeable difference in my brows!  Also, for anyone out there who is price shopping, the price here on Amazon is the best around, so don&#x27;t bother looking anywhere else.  Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work well</li>
    <li> This stuff works! Really!</li>
    <li> The item works very well.</li>
    <li> It really worked for me. Just have to remember to put it on!!!</li>
    <li> Had never heard of it, but I split a two pack with a friend when we found it on sale. Been using it for about 7 weeks and the results have been impressive. Even my bottom lashes are getting long. Also using it on my eyebrows which were getting a bit sparse and have seen an improvement there to.  Easy to apply, just brush along the top lashes at bedtime. No worries about eye color changes as with Latisse.  Much cheaper too. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am the most cynical person you&#x27;ll ever meet. I was convinced this was snake oil in a tube. My friend insisted I give it a shot. Holy hell. After only one tube, My lashes lengthened about 60%. I saw about a 25% increase in thickness. (By the way I applied it to both on the top lid line AND the under lid line.)  I used it on my eyebrows, and that growth was closer to 75%. It even filled in a little eyebrow bald spot. I want to buy this by the gallon and use it on the rapidly thinning hair on my head.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find this in my orders but I did purchase this from Amazon after reading the reviews. I am on approximately my 4th week of use. There is a definite difference in the thickness of my lashes.  Also, always in the past when I rubbed my eyes I would manage to lose a few lashes. I have lost none since using this.  There may be a slight increase in the length, but anything is an improvement so I am happy about that. I do wear contacts...I have had no issues.  I have applied it to my top and bottom lash line.  I am hopeful over time to be able to notice a significance difference in the length.  But as I said, I am very pleased with the increased volume. I have had no discoloration that other reviewers have mentioned. Absolutely no problems at all...sometimes a little dry white stuff when I wake up if I used too much the night before. Definitely worth the shot. I will purchase this again.  I will update if I have any of the problems others reported with long-term usage.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!  I finally have long beautiful lashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian an I have tried several other costly eyelash enhances which didn&#x27;t work. Rapid lash works for me and co-workers have noticed !!! Love it</li>
    <li> Been trying for 5 wks now  ... not as fast growing as I hoped  ... but we will see.  I had those fake single lashes removed and she cut and removed my own lashes!  So hardly any to begin with  ... but still using it!  Need more soon!  My friends swear by Rapid Lash!</li>
    <li> A great product and fast delivery...thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I broke out in enflamed puffy eyelids, extremely noticeable bloodshot eyes and crust around the application areas. I tried taking breaks in between an application or two just to give myself a rest, even tried applying less product with the same affect.:/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and found that it worked well.  However, like others, I ordered this twice recently and each time found that the tube was completely dry upon opening it.  Once is a mistake, twice means the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t care.  Luckily, it was within the 30 day Amazon return window so I&#x27;m getting my money back and fortunately returns on Amazon couldn&#x27;t be easier.  While this type of product did work for me, I&#x27;ll try a different manufacturer, there are several with good reviews here on Amazon for others that don&#x27;t seem to have the manufacturing problem as RapidLash seems to be having now.  I usually wouldn&#x27;t leave a review for something like this, but clearly there&#x27;s a problem here, and so I can&#x27;t recommend the product until RapidLash begins to care about its terrible manufacturing standards.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!  Have long, thick lashes and eyebrows thanks to this product.  Have been using for years now and love it.  Will continue to reorder and use.  Quick and easy to use and no side affects.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Been using for 5 weeks on average 5-6 nights a week, sometimes I forget. I&#x27;ve noticed stronger eyelashes and can see a difference in volume or thickness after I apply mascara. I notice a slight difference in volume and thickness without mascara at this point. I believe with continued use I will see even better results and am looked forward to some improvements in length as well. I&#x27;m getting another tube of this soon so if I&#x27;m coming back for more that&#x27;s a good sign. Give it a try and be patient for some results.  Now I wish I could find an eye cream that does what it says....</li>
    <li> Still waiting for some results.</li>
    <li> The best eyelash serum I have ever used. Have tried others but keep coming back to this one.</li>
    <li> No results! I was hoping, but No Results!</li>
    <li> The important thing to remember about this is that hair has a growth cycle. It grows, it rests and it falls out so give it 6 weeks and you will probably be pleased - I know I am and I&#x27;ve used it for over 5 years.</li>
    <li> This item caused a allergic reaction. Had to go to eye Dr. &amp; was given antibiotics  &amp; steroid drops. Dr. advised me not to use the product further.&lt;br /&gt;Evidently you have to give 1 star.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 6 months.  Showed growth in, I&#x27;d say, about a month.  I have extremely short lashes and now when I put mascara on it looks like I actually have lashes.  Yay!  One area in corner of one eye doesn&#x27;t seen to grow length.  I just add a little extra mascara on those!  Lol</li>
    <li> Longer lashes in weeks</li>
    <li> Save your $$$ from faux-lash lengthening mascara &amp; pony up the $26 for a tube of this. It lasts all year and WORKS FOR REALIO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For four weeks nothing happened, I applied it nightly. I felt ripped off &amp; stupid. Fifth week: whoa, Mamma! Lash-a-palooza. 😘. Wink wink wink. I guess it takes time for the stuff to build up &amp; cause a change in your lash follicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patience, my pretties. Patience of a month to 6 weeks (I got my mom a tube... 6 weeks for her).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know they developed it for burn victims, so it&#x27;s like, actual medicine, not some cheesy drugstore baby oil promise.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27; love it 😍😍</li>
    <li> So far I see some growth of lashes</li>
    <li> Little by little  I see this working. It is a slow process but I will definitely  purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t wk as well as Latise</li>
    <li> If I could I would give it a half star rating.  This tube had a minimal amount of serum inside, I feel ripped off.  Who can I contact for a replacement tube?  :(</li>
    <li> I first ordered Rapidlash in July 2013 and it worked great to make my lashes grow thicker, but not longer.  It also conditions the delicate skin on the eyelid.  Apparently the formula changed and the one I ordered in Nov 2014 no longer does anything for eyelash growth.  However, it continues to make the eyelid skin softer.</li>
    <li> Not had chance to thoroughly test it properly yet but it seems to provide what it says on the box</li>
    <li> This is the 4th week and I&#x27;m beginning to see growth:)</li>
    <li> I have been using Rapid Lash for almost 6 years-it is very rare that I miss applying it at the end of the evening!&lt;br /&gt;I am 62 yrs. young and with age of course hair-skin-nails take a toll, I will say that this is a very impressive and consistent product.&lt;br /&gt;This is a reasonably prices product when ordering from Costco-$49.99 for 2 tubes and less than $3.00 for shipping!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Rapid Lash for my &amp;#34;Bette Davis&amp;#34; eyes!!!</li>
    <li> useless and expensive</li>
    <li> I have short, straight eyelashes. I used this product in my 30&#x27;s. I&#x27;m now 44 and my lashes have thinned as well as being short and straight so had to go back to using. Wish I had posted a before and after. I only buy products after reading reviews. This product truly does make my lashes grow. The price on Amazon is so much better. I was paying $39.99 plus tax at Bed, Bath, and Beyond and Ulta. Now, when I curl my lashes with my little curler, you can actually see them.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it made any difference.. But then I am a senior and that might be why.. It&#x27;s a bit late to grow new lashes..</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years now and love it! If you use it everyday for the first few weeks, you can taper back to 2-3 times a week for maintenance. I use each tube for a couple months and then buy another. I use it on my eyebrows as well.😋</li>
    <li> Does not really seem to work.</li>
    <li> Baloney! Product does not work!</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully.  Didn&#x27;t tell anyone I was using it and my 15 year old daughter noticed the difference in my lashes one day.  Amazing product.</li>
    <li> Super irritating. First time using it and I got a bluish red line on the base of my eye lid.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does make your lashes grow! I have used it pretty much daily for the past 2 months and I have seen a change in both the length and fullness of my lashes.  I am actually quite blown away.  It is a more noticeable difference in regards to length, but the fullness has started to become more evident as time passes.  Great product that does what it claims!</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from Kathie Lee Gifford. I suffer from thyroid disease, which in turn, causes my eyelashes and eyebrows to become very sparse. This product began its magic only three days into applications. A win win for me!</li>
    <li> Love it have been using ir for about three years my eyelashes look much better when I use it then when I dont</li>
    <li> Almost been a month and I see some results. When I put on mascara, my bottom lashes are definitely longer and the top lashes appear thicker but not so much additional length on top. Makes eyelids appear redder even in the morning so I usually find myself having to put eyeliner and mascara to hide redness</li>
    <li> It works.&lt;br /&gt;Jonnie Johnson</li>
    <li> Love this product! Really thickens and lengthens lashes.!!!</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me.  Save your money!!</li>
    <li> Been using for about 2 months. Seems to be working somewhat - lashes seem a bit fuller and longer. No one has commented however, so it&#x27;s subtle.</li>
    <li> Does not seem to have the same amount in the bottle as the ones I purchases before!</li>
    <li> The product does work. But even with consistent use, the longer lashes will fall out and you will need to stop use and wait a while to start trying for regrowth (I figured this out after years of use). Great for getting gorgeous lashes for a wedding etc.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful, but you do have to be patient. I didn&#x27;t see really noticeable results until the 8 weeks that the product says it need. And now, 5 months later, I have people constantly asking if my eyelashes are real. At the doctors office the nurse went to get the other nurses to look at how long my natural eyelashes are. The only criticism I can think of is that while my eye lashes are longer and softer and healthier, they don&#x27;t seem any thicker. I think this stuff works by keeping lashes from falling out. I used to always loose one or two when I removed my make-up. I think I loose only 1 or 2 a month now. I apply it religiously every morning after getting out of the shower. And let it dry at least 5 minutes before I start the rest of my moisturizer regime.</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly amazing. My lashes are so much longer and thicker than they were before after less than a month of use. LOVE this stuff and will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using but have not seen any mentionable growth</li>
    <li> The product works very well. I just started using it and my lashes are definitely longer.  I hope they get thicker.</li>
    <li> Good product. I saw results probably within first couple of weeks. I wouldn&#x27;t say that my lashes got longer. But, definitely more fullness. More lashes growing in, gave full effect. I am happy with results.</li>
    <li> Update: It&#x27;s been 8 weeks and my lashes are twice as long and thick as they have been since I was in high school 40 years ago!!!</li>
    <li> I was only able to use it for a few days and then stopped as it burned my eyes.</li>
    <li> A big two thumbs down.  I have tried Enormous Lash, Latisse, and Revitash. This product does not even come close to these three. I was so disappointed that I stopped using it even though I have two of them. I&#x27;m just going to throw them out.  &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me at all.  Save your money.  I used it every night for 30 data and saw no improvement,  rather more lashes were falling out.  I will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I know several people that want to get an RX for Latisse. Save your money and buy this stuff because IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> My eyelashes have not changed at all since  I started using this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product! ! It really works!! I have noticed a big difference in my lashed and brows. I have 3 friends that started using it after they saw my results. Get it!</li>
    <li> After using the prescription product, a friend told me about this.  In addition to liking the price as compared to what I had been using, my lashes are the longest they&#x27;ve ever been.  They are not thicker or darker, but really long.</li>
    <li> Rapid lash does work if used on a continuos basis, consistency and correct application is key.  Always cleanse your face prior to application.  Do not apply anything to the eye prior to using the lash serum-for best result.  Make sure brush is saturated with serum, apply along upper lash line.  Do not pump the tube (as some may do with mascara); doing will draw into the tube air and airborne contaminants.  This will dry out the serum ergo a short shelf life.</li>
    <li> It really does take 6 weeks so be patient but this product did lengthen my lashes. Recommended by the stylist who did my permanent fake lashes when I stopped getting them done.</li>
    <li> People have been asking me what have I been doing to have such long eye lashes.  I am so pleased with this product.  Many of my friends are now buying it too.</li>
    <li> I used this previously about 4 years ago and found that it worked great on my eye brows that were thining.  I also appllied it to my lower lashes.  I stopped using it, and noticed now that I&#x27;m approaching 50, I needed it again.  It takes about a week to notice a difference and I  sure did notice that my lower lashes were coming in strong  and visible.  Also my eye brows are thick and dark, where they were thin and non existent.&lt;br /&gt;I would use this instead of that expensive prescription stuff that is being advertised all over the place.  Just apply it at  night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it works perfectly. When I don&#x27;t use it, my lashes get thin and sparse. After using it a couple of months, my lashes are very full. Love a product that does what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> Definitely noticed results after the first 2 weeks. Best to apply at night, made my eye lids a little puffy.</li>
    <li> Best results I&#x27;ve seen in my life</li>
    <li> This product WORKS!! After about 2 weeks of consistent use, lashes are so long I might have to trim them! Lol. Nice seller also.</li>
    <li> After reading plenty of reviews on Rapidlash from many different sites, most of which were quite positive, I decided to give it a try. Although I did see some results as far as my lashes getting thicker and a fraction longer, it really didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. And it irritated the heck out of my eyes. I woke up to dry, flaky, red eyelids that itched. Not a good look. I mean, really? Is this what I have to endure for minuscule results? I think not. I didn&#x27;t even finish the tube. I used it everyday for about a month, then, just a couple of times a week after that. Now I just use it on my brows and use a much better lash enhancer for my lashes. I don&#x27;t know, maybe it will work for some, but it didn&#x27;t agree with me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over five years. Helps lengthen and thicken my eyelashes and also darkens my eyebrows. Being over 60, these were all issues I had to deal with. Highly recommend as this product is also safe and will not change eye color as some other lash lengthening products will especially if you have blue eyes which I do.</li>
    <li> Feels fine when it goes on at night, but the next day it BURNS. My eyes feel like they are on fire and they are bloodshot. It even hurts when I touch my contacts to take them out. I&#x27;ve been putting in eye drops incessantly all day and it hasn&#x27;t helped. It might work on your eyebrows ,but do not use on eyelashes if you wear contacts or have dry eyes. I wish they warned me!</li>
    <li> I dont think for the price there is enough in the tube. Also, didn&#x27;t see a difference in my length</li>
    <li> It did absolutely nothing for my lashes! it was a waste of money. I&#x27;m going to try enhancers at walrt by oil of olay</li>
    <li> This works but not to the drastic measures I read on some of the reviews. However, it did make my lashes longer and thicker...no one really noticed but I did for sure. Since my lashes were very thin, anything was better than it was before I used this product. It did take several months to notice and the most obvious time is when I put on mascara. One tube lasted an easy 4 months. I will continue using it!!!</li>
    <li> I have not been using this product for very long (less than a month)  but I do see some improvement in lash length.... I will continue to use it nightly and see what happens.... I did have eye surgery last July for vision correction and I must say that this product does not sting my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years now, and it definitely works. Even when I&#x27;m not wearing mascara, people comment on the length and fullness of my lashes. When I do have mascara on, people often think my lashes are false. It is important that you&#x27;re consistent the product (don&#x27;t stop and start using it) so that you don&#x27;t experience regression, but it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all!  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I had a terrible reaction to this product. I have tried two others and did not experience any problems. Be cautious if you have any eye sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third tube.  Stay with it in the beginning, use it every nite for a couple of months, and you will see the difference.  I don&#x27;t wear daily mascara anymore.  Now I&#x27;m on an every other day sched; tube lasts about 3 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it works just as it says. I also apply to my bottom lashes. I usually see results after about two or three weeks. I use it for about a month and a half but then stop and then will buy a new one in a year. My lashes turn back to normal about a few weeks after stopping use of this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing product my lashes become longer and thicker</li>
    <li> so far ok. Don&#x27;t notice much growth yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products that say they work.  But this one really works ......I&#x27;ve used at least 4 rapid lash ........ my eye lashes are really long and I&#x27;ve put t on my eyebrows and they have really come in great.  Most definitely would recommend everyone to use it.</li>
    <li> I love this product I just bought my second bottle...this is magic</li>
    <li> I was using lumigan for about 60$ but in Mexico where I would buy it they discontinued it.I thought latisse was to pricy so after reviews I decided to purchase rapid lash.At first I thought it was not working because it&#x27;s not as fast as lumigan.But after about 3 weeks I started to notice a difference. It&#x27;s alot better than lumigan because you never go through the shedding process.I hardly have lash loss now and I get alot of compliments on my lashes.I now just use every other day to maintain.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes started growing back immediately.  I am so pleased with it I&#x27;ve told all my friends &amp; relatives about it.  I thought i&#x27;d never see my lashes again.  I am truly surprised &amp; grateful. Thanks Rapidlash!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Must continue use as lashes will stop growing when you stop using the product.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and I have to keep ordering it for her.</li>
    <li> Does NOT work. Consistently used this junk.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never using Latisse:&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I have blue eyes, and I don&#x27;t want brown ones.&lt;br /&gt;RapidLash makes your eyelashes not fall out so they get much longer. It does not make new ones grow as Latisse does.&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t even have to wear eyeliner, and I&#x27;m very fair so without liner before RapidLash I looked like a mouse with tiny eyes. I have blonde lashes, and I dye them black.&lt;br /&gt; It does seem to make eyebrows thicker. I have Hashimoto&#x27;s, so my brows were really thin. This seems to fill them out, especially the tail ends.&lt;br /&gt;You have to use it every night. I tried every other night, and the lashes started falling out.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a cycle where some do fall out (they have to eventually), but they still look much better than before RapidLash.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 3 yrs and work very well</li>
    <li> Excellent seller. Good product.</li>
    <li> Ordered product a few days ago and the expiration date was 2/15.</li>
    <li> simply put a wast of money. This does not work like it used to.</li>
    <li> I liked the application process and the fact that it didn&#x27;t have a scent. It was easy to apply and I did not have any reactions with using this product. I used this morning and night for one month and it ran out.. Was not expecting it to run out that quick, especially for paying 28 dollars. I have long lashes anyways so I was more focused on my eyebrow growth from over plucking. I feel that the new eyelash growth came in straight and some normal but overall I really didn&#x27;t think it was worth buying another tube because it ran out way to quick. I would have loved to continue for the full 2 months that is recommends but since it didn&#x27;t even last a month, I do not think its worth the money to buy each month.</li>
    <li> Was sad to see that the date on the bottom of this product had me under the impression that his product was expired. Contacted the seller and was told that the date on the bottom of this product was a manufacturing date, not an expiration date. I&#x27;m not sure who regulates this type of product, but from what I know when you see a date on something it is always an expiration date. I guess I will still try this product out to see how it works and make an update with my results. Also tried to search the rapid lash website to see if they had any answers to similar questions about this due to seeing all the reviews about people possibly receiving expired product and I didn&#x27;t not find anything on the rapid lash website. Needless to say, I am still skeptical and not sure about this product.</li>
    <li> Great product! The first time I used it, I was coming off of 3 years of wearing false eyelashes and I had no freaking eyelashes of my own. I looked like a ghost. It worked wonders. I stopped using it for probably like a year now. My eyelashes are still really good from the first time, I just want to see if it will make them even fuller.</li>
    <li> AMAZING, yes it takes about 2 weeks but I have seen a huge difference! Even my boyfriend did and he never notices anything!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I wasn&#x27;t sure that buying a less expensive product was going to pay out in the end, but I&#x27;m glad I gave it a shot. I first received Rapid Lash 5 months ago and applied this serum to my eyelashes every night, which was great, I never had any itching or burning like some of these reviews have mentioned. It took 2 weeks to notice an agreeable difference and 1 month for my eyelashes double in length. Since then I haven&#x27;t had any problems losing eyelashes, as you can see from the after shot taken after 4 months of no Rapid Lash applications. I would recommend this awesome product to anyone looking to grow out their eye lashes because it works!!!</li>
    <li> Takes a little while but works</li>
    <li> I really like it. Now everyone have a great day!</li>
    <li> It really does work. I am onto my second tube. It takes around 2-3 weeks to see definitive results, but consistent application daily renders the best result. I normally applied after shower and leave it on over night. A thin coating is sufficient. It does not irritate my eyes at all. Very happy with the purchase and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Rapidlash for about four years.  It has helped my eyelashes grow a little longer and fill in.  I plan to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  It worked after using it for 2 weeks and I just bought my 2nd tube.  I also got my daughter hooked.</li>
    <li> But, I never know if I&#x27;m putting enough product on. After one application it seems none of the product is on the lash line, so I usually put 2 or 3 applications on.</li>
    <li> It really works..had been using another product which cost way more but this is better than the one I was paying so much for...</li>
    <li> I have used a number of products like this.  I can&#x27;t see that this has created any lash growth.  I would not buy it again,.</li>
    <li> since they removed the one ingredient that worked - it does nothing - will not buy again</li>
    <li> I have tried other eyelash serum and always come back to rapidlash because it seems to work the best. I  reaaly need o rim some of my lashed they have grown so muchj.I haven&#x27;t notice new ones growing in  as the ones I  have getting longerI</li>
    <li> and nothing has happened. i put it on at night time. it does make your eyelids a little itchy. let see what happens after another month, if it last that long.</li>
    <li> Havent noticed any difference... Dissapointing</li>
    <li> This works! my eyelashes got longer after about a month. This is my second one and it does last a long time! (3 months or so? I applied a lot too including on the actual lashes)&lt;br /&gt;My friends and family have noticed the difference right away!</li>
    <li> This works just have to be patient. Saw results in maybe a couple months. Have been using off and on for a couple years.</li>
    <li> I saw absolutely no change.  I was very diligent and did not skip a single night.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am a 65 year old postmenopausal woman. My eyelashes started to thin out and become a bit stubby. I use this product morning and night. After about 3 weeks my eyelashes started to grow in longer and fuller than they ever were before. I will keep reordering this product.</li>
    <li> love this stuff, use it once a day for over a year, should use twicw but great results with once</li>
    <li> hated it. still have no growth after 6 wks</li>
    <li> Rapid lash eyelash is awesome. I am very pleased on fast this works thank you  rapid lash</li>
    <li> Enhances eyelash growth but once you stop using eyelashes seem to fall out more frequently than when busing</li>
    <li> This works as well as prescription product. Stick with it because it takes about 4 weeks to notice the difference. When the tube is almost run dry and you&#x27;re ready to give up, you will see. This does not change eye color like the prescription product.</li>
    <li> This works great for me! My eyelashes touch my sunglasses😄</li>
    <li> This did make my eyelashes longer within a month so it works just give it time. I gave it 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t make my eyelashes thicker.</li>
    <li> Amazing product that actually works - lashes were much fuller &amp; longer in a short period of time!  Tried other products that were totally ineffective.</li>
    <li> This product is as good as or better than prescriptions; lashes grow almost as you watch.  GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> This product really helps thicken eyelashes!!</li>
    <li> It works,!Why spend crazy $ at the doctor?</li>
    <li> I received this item and began using it for one week.  I started to notice a difference but happened to look at the bottom of the container and saw a date of 06/13, meaning the product had likely expired (I received it mid november 2013).  I am not sure if it&#x27;s in my head but I swear my eyelashes are growing and looking long and amazing.  I contacted the company that sold me the original product and they will send me a new one free of charge.  If this product works being almost 6 months old, I can only imagine how effective it will be when I receive a non-expired bottle.  Try it out ladies, it works!</li>
    <li> I am not sure how this works or why but it is the best product. I saw a marked difference in only a few days!!!</li>
    <li> This works!  It really works.  Purchased as a recommendation from a friend.  Early 50&#x27;s so lashes were &#x27;showing their age&#x27;. Applied diligently every night , after 6 or so weeks I started seeing results and then....colleagues started commenting.  No burning or irritation whatsoever.  I do believe discipline is required- every night! My lashes are quite long, I now apply every other night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Rapid Lash for two months now. I&#x27;m very impressed and pleased with my results. Lashes are thicker and longer. Top photo is last summer with eyeliner and mascara. Middle photo is after 1 month of use with eyeliner and mascara. Bottom photo is two months of use with mascara only.</li>
    <li> My lashes are so long that they tangle.  This stuff is legit.</li>
    <li> I had an believable response to this eyelash enhancer. My eyelashes doubled in length. The problem I had was in the second order. There seemed to be half as much product in the tube and I ran out very quickly. Not sure if I want to risk another order.</li>
    <li> I use it every night...seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a big improvement in my lashes.  They are definitely longer and I use less mascara.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have uses this product in the past and had results. When I opened the product my tube seemed dry. I would not by from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it really works for me. Everybody notice my eyelashes got longer.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash enhancing product!  I used this serem &amp; then ran out so I thought I&#x27;d try a different brand...huge mistake!  I ordered Rapidlash &amp; couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it.  I am very happy with product, it does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I highly recommend buying this if you&#x27;re looking for great results.</li>
    <li> This fit perfectly.  I couldn&#x27;t find this separately in home depot or Lowe&#x27;s . It only came in a kit and I didn&#x27;t need the other parts. Great price. I always find what i need on&lt;br /&gt;Amazon .</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 4 months and love it, I have used Latisse and Aminogenisis and this product has the same great results. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I used this once before - years ago - and it worked very well. Tried a second tube and it stopped working. Several years went by and I decided to try improving my lashes again, but I tried different products (City Lash and SmartLash). Don&#x27;t waste your money! I ordered RapidLash one more time, since it had worked before, and I am once again amazed that it&#x27;s working again. Yes, the lashes grow in a little wild, but I don&#x27;t mind. It&#x27;s almost time for a second tube and I hope I have continued great results and not the disappointment of last time I tried a second tube. Fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> There was such a big difference in my lashes after a month of  using this product.</li>
    <li> I think I got an old one.  Seemed like there wasn&#x27;t anything in it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I am 61 yrs old and my lashes had become very short and thin.  After approx. 4-5 weeks of using this every night I am proud to say that my lashes are so much fuller and as long as they were in my 20&#x27;s!!  Just put it on as if you are using a liquid eye liner right before you go to bed.  I have also used in on my lower lashes and now I have long lower lashes.  Love wearing mascara again.</li>
    <li> I researched a number of eyelash enhancement products before buying this one. I can&#x27;t say enough about it. It really works. I started to see a difference in about 3 weeks. Once I reached middle age all my lashes seemed to be gone and after starting this product 2 months ago I have the lashes I had in my 20s.</li>
    <li> For the price, this product works better than any other eye lash growth serum! It doesn&#x27;t change your eye color nor stain your skin. I think it&#x27;s about the best on the market and I&#x27;ve tried several including lattisse!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years.  It takes a concerted effort to allow this product to work.  You need to apply the product in the evening and it has to be done diligently.  You will see a difference as long as  you are willing to wait.</li>
    <li> I have absolutely noticed a big difference in the number and thickness of my eyelashes.  I would change the application tip to a softer tip, but it is still reasonable to work with.  I will continue to use this on my eyelashes.  I do not use on my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Rapidlash definitely made my lashes grow longer..</li>
    <li> I know the product works - I&#x27;ve been using it a few years now.  I do want to know the MANUFACTURE DATE  O R&lt;br /&gt;THE EXPIRIATION DATE.  When I purchase in 2013 the manufacturer was still printing the &#x27;manufacture date&#x27; on the bottom.  Another user seems to feel they now indicate &#x27;expiration date &amp; THE THAT DATE ON THE BOTTOM&#x27;.  Unless it specifically says Expiration Date, I know it is the manufacture date.  But for crying out loud, can I get an anwer to my question as to what it indicates on the bottom?  If it shows just the date I presume same as before that date is the manufacture date.  If it says &#x27;expiration date&#x27; on the bottom, they have changed their procedure &amp; tell me it shows as &#x27;expiration date&#x27; &amp; what the date is please?&lt;br /&gt; Don&#x27;t think I can ask any clearer than that, can I?  Please advise whwt is printed on the bottom - exactly.  Thanks much!</li>
    <li> I am 53 years old and have very skimpy lashes, part of getting old I guess. I tried Latisse and it worked great but after a few weeks of using it, I developed dark brown circles under my eyes, looked like a Zombie!!&lt;br /&gt;I have gorgeous long lashes again and Thank Goodness, no dark circles!! Yay Me!!&lt;br /&gt;You do have to use this stuff forever though or you lose the lashes again but once you get them, you can skip a day to make the product last longer.</li>
    <li> My esthitician recomended Lilash but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $70 a tube. This one was much cheaper and if you remember to put it on every night before bed it really works fast, 3 weeks and I had double the lashes!</li>
    <li> Use this all the time and love it. My lashes have never been so long and thick.....blacker too!</li>
    <li> Have been using it for more than 6 months , a drastic longer change on my eyelashes. I&#x27;m recommending it to all my sisters n friends.</li>
    <li> have purchased this product from 3 different sellers on Amazon. All 3 times, there was no or little product in tube (which was sealed).&lt;br /&gt;However, Amazon refunded my money. I would purchase this product again in the future (maybe when a new supply comes in) because I have used it in the past and it really works.</li>
    <li> As I wrote in my review for this product over 3 years ago, this product has changed my life.  I am blonde with sparse eyelashes, and this product has made them fuller and longer.  It saves me time applying my mascara, since I don&#x27;t need to use as much anymore.  Also, when I run out of Rapidlash, it takes quite awhile to lose the effect-my lashes stay fuller and longer for quite some time.</li>
    <li> Seller sold me a dried up out dated bottle. BEWARE!  I love this product, when it&#x27;s new. I will order another just not from this seller.</li>
    <li> I like the applicator but there was barely anything in the container. After 3rd use my eyes felt dry and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;Did not work for me.</li>
    <li> So I bought this originally on a whim because the faux eyelash display was almost empty.  I assumed that I would not see much in the way of a change but thought why not.  Now I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and my once long and think lashes are not what they used to be.  I used this every night in my routine as directed.  After about 4 weeks I could not believe how long my lashes started looking.  It seemed like they changed overnight 4 weeks in.  This product actually works if you stick with it.  Just ordered my 2nd tube via Amazon for a much better price.  Also started running it through my eyebrows to help them out as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rapidlash for about 2 months. I had great results with length. But as of now I am noticing quite a few lashes falling out, more than usual and I am nervous! I want to keep using it to see if I am going thru a growth stage. Has anyone else had this happen? And if so did your lashes grow back fine and normally or keep falling out?</li>
    <li> This is a product that delivers!  I can&#x27;t imagine ever not using it.  After about 2 weeks, I started to see a slight difference; after a month, it was obvious that my lashes were getting not only longer, but curlier.  I used it to fill in a sparse part of my eyebrow, and it worked for that too.  The product lasts me about 3 months, and I&#x27;m on my 3rd order.  Have recommended this product and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> This is the only eyelash enhancement that works on me.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product.</li>
    <li> Have been using for a three weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed longer lashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now and it really does make my lashes grow and they&#x27;re thicker as well. Kathie Lee Gifford was right when she highly recommended this on her show, more than once I might add!</li>
    <li> I must have been allergic to it. Got an eye infection and needed antibiotic eye drops.</li>
    <li> Wow...just wow.  You have to use EVERY NIGHT but this will work if you are PATIENT.  My lashes look like a chicks (minus the mascara) and the girls love it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Only three weeks in though? So maybe next week</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite effective for me, but everyone should check which product works better for you or triggers your allergy.  Also I&#x27;ve needed to keep using it for about three weeks to see the difference, but it has made a clear difference.  Note that you have to use it regularly if you&#x27;d like to keep them enhanced.  This lash enhancer needs to be applied only before you go to bed.  Also next morning you might notice a whitish membrane like substance where you applied it.  It&#x27;s a residual substance after it dried and when you wash your face, it would disappear as it is water-soluble.  Also it&#x27;s worked for my eyebrows as well.</li>
    <li> Not sure this works, although it hasn&#x27;t been as long as they say it would take. I don&#x27;t see any gradual improvement and I can&#x27;t imagine the eyebrows fill up by magic all at once.</li>
    <li> After losing all of my eyelashes due to a health problem a few years back, I have had to deal with short, fragile eyelashes and having to apply false lashes daily to achieve any sort of lash look. Desperate, I searched for products aimed towards eyelash growth. I found that the reviews for this were pretty good and thought I would give it a shot. I noticed results within the first week! By week 8 my lashes almost appeared to be fake due to the length and thickness! I am seriously blown away by this product. Started using in February of 2015 and now approaching June I am about to order my 3rd tube. Only thing that is a little irritating is I have sensitive skin and eyes so the product does leave a slight red eyeliner-like mark close to the lash line, but it is nothing that makeup or concealer will not cover. Order this product NOW and try it for yourself!!!</li>
    <li> Works well have used for several years and do notice longer fuller lashes with no side effects</li>
    <li> A girl&#x27;s best kept secret!  This stuff really works, you do have to be consistent and use it nightly to see results.  Love it!  I&#x27;m on my 3rd tube, but I will say that each tube last 4-5 months.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT IT REALLY WORKS!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used neu lash in the past from neiman marcus for $150.00 it works, but rapidlash works just as well</li>
    <li> This product does not work. I have been using it for 5 weeks. I have not seen any growth at all. This is a waste of money. This product has a lot of good reviews. But it has not worked for me.</li>
    <li> It works okay, I notice a small difference on upper eyelashes only.</li>
    <li> I waited over 2 months to write a review in order to give the product the benefit of the doubt. But after weeks of almost religiously applying it, I did not see any difference. I was taking photos on a weekly basis to track my progress, but if there were any effect it wasn&#x27;t very visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Asian and have very short, thin eyelashes. Recently I also had problems with eyelashes falling whenever I would take off my waterproof mascara. I was hoping Rapidlash could strengthen and possibly lengthen my eyelashes. Alas, it did nothing much. The best solution for my lashes was to just stop wearing waterproof mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, do not recommend for women with Asian heritage.</li>
    <li> This is the only one that worked for me and I tried many.</li>
    <li> this is the fourth time i have a received a expired rapid lash from a sellar. the mfg date is 01/14 on the bottom of it, now it doesnt say expiration but what other reason would there be a date on it if it wasnt expired if they can prove me wrong then in will change my rating but the product doesnt work like it is used to either. sorry but i will what for someone to prove me wrong!</li>
    <li> Love love this.  Just wish that product darken lashes and it would be perfect.  But will never be without product!!</li>
    <li> I do not know how many people agree with me, but this product helped me a lot to grow my eyelash!&lt;br /&gt;I had to wait at least one and a half month to see if they have a good effect on my eyelash, and it clearly worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad effect was that right after I stopped using it, my eyelashes fell off, and I freaked out.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am not using this so much anymore, but I use it once or twice a week so I do not have to worry about my eyelash anymore.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think this would work on my stubby thin eyelashes but it did! Takes a couple months of everyday use but it does work! Yeah for lashes!!!</li>
    <li> Been almost 3 months..eyelashes are definitly fuller and stronger...starting see some lengthening as of 1 week ago</li>
    <li> I have very short, thin lashes. But with Rapidlash, wow, what a difference! My lashes are half way up to my brows without mascara and touch my brows with mascara. I love it! Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works great takes about 4 weeks but everyone comments on my eyelashes !&lt;br /&gt;People ask me if the are mine!</li>
    <li> I was shocked, it really works!  Just be patient, apply twice a day morning and evening and improvement will happen.  I have a space on one eye that didn&#x27;t fill in, until I used this product.  Have been using a few months, but do see improvement in the &amp;#34;baby lashes&amp;#34; filling in.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I am on an oral chemo drug and lose my eyelashes periodically. I use the serum each evening and within a few weeks my eyelashes are back and slightly darker in color.  Need I say more?</li>
    <li> Great price and item arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second purchase of RapidLash .&lt;br /&gt;This product does really work I have eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had full and longer eyebrows for at least 15-20 years.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 plus years.  Would not go without it.</li>
    <li> I love this eye lash serum. This is my second time using the product. I used it the first time before my wedding a few years ago. My lashes became SO long! You have to be religious about applying this product. If you are, you will have wonderful results! I also applied this to my eyebrows to try to get more growth in certain areas after I had (unfortunately) over-plucked them in my teenage years. This product did a great job in this area, also! I want to definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for an eye lash serum! Also, this is almost half the price of what the product is in stores!</li>
    <li> I brought this from a Groupon and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results. I always had long eyelashes- but lost them due to an unfortunate eyelash &amp;#34;situation&#x27; after having lash extensions! NEVER AGAIN WILL I DO THAT!  I lost a ton of lashes, pulled out from my roots so I had bald spots where my lashes used to be.  To say I was depressed about the issue- is an understatement. SIGH I used Lastisse at first,  but hated how much product was wasted in the application.  A $120 a pop every drop matters. With RapidLashes- my lashes are not only back to fighting form- but have surpassed my previous length! Brushes against my glasses long!  My only complaint is that they haven&#x27;t made my lashes any thicker. Otherwise, I&#x27;m very happy with my results.</li>
    <li> I believe I received a fare price on the two items.  I am very satisfied.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is helping so much,I have tried different types and they did not work like this . So I highly recommend Rapidlash</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried both Rapidlash and Latisse with different results.  For Rapidlash, my lashes seemed to get thicker in a more eye-lashy kind of way.  As if I was wearing just a bit of mascara.  They were indeed longer but not so long I had to think about cutting them.  With Latisse, I had to wait longer to see results but they were remarkable.  My lashes were feathery and very long; sometimes a bit on the uneven side, but nothing to really complain about.  They did get very long!  With both products, I noticed that my eyes were red and irritated in the morning.  I used a preservative-free moisturizing eye drop to abate this problem.  With either of these lash enhancing products, once you stop using them the results diminish then fade away completely.  They both work so it&#x27;s a matter of personal preference which you choose.  Perhaps it would work to use them in tandem.  One one month, then the other the next month, and so on.  Whatever you do, try to budget to keep using the products.  I had other priorities that were more pressing financially and had to stop.  I miss my drama-lashes!</li>
    <li> I only buy this product when it is $30 or less. I have ordered this product several times over the last few years, but I believe this is one of those products that you must continue to use to see long lasting effects. It has grown my lashes out longer to the point where I don&#x27;t need fake lashes.</li>
    <li> I finally have eyelashes.  It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
</ol>
