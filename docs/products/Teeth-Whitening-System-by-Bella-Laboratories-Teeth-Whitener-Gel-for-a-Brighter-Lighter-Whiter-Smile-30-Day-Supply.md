### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t stay in the top tray</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t even keep the liquid in the top tray.  </li>
      <li>Your investment in any toothpaste will be better than spending on this product.</li>
      <li>Okay in the package you get two plastic tubes with the \\&quot;gel\\</li>
      <li>Something happened to their quality control and I&#x27;m sure they would want to know about it.</li>
      <li>The plastic tubes contain the whitening \\&quot;gel\\&quot; but to me it isn&#x27;t gel its more of liquid than a gel.</li>
      <li>Like many others the gel that you are suppose to inject into a bit tray is liquid not a gel</li>
      <li>so you can breathe and it has the top and bottom part attached together</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d love to try a tooth whitening system that works, is comfortable and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>but the applicators were filled with a liquid instead of a gel.  </li>
      <li>If you purchase the product make sure to check the expiration date and use right away.  </li>
      <li>The first time I applied it my floor got more of the product than the guard did.</li>
      <li>your pretty much just drooling all over so be sure to have a towel on hand.</li>
      <li>I generally spend so much on teeth whitening products that I was happy to find one so reasonable and would work (based on the reviews).  </li>
      <li>&quot; in it, a mouth piece, mouth piece case, and a strip of paper to see the wonderful shades of teeth from yellow straight up to the brightest of white.</li>
      <li>The product was supposed to be of a gel like substance but it was like water and didn&#x27;t stay in the trays at all it poured right out.  </li>
      <li>I ended up using the rest of the contents of the first applicator by applying it to my teeth with a q-tip and using the trays to keep the liquid away from the rest of my mouth.  </li>
      <li>It was exactly as described...</li>
      <li>This, of course, not made clear to you except at the very bottom of the original email in the smallest of print.  </li>
      <li>It is not to be found on the confirmation receipt you print out, foolishly thinking this will protect you, nor is it made clear on the original body of the original email, except for the tiny print at the bottom.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in teeth color, either.</li>
      <li>It claims to be a gel, but it&#x27;s really just some liquid substance that doesn&#x27;t bond to your teeth or the mouth piece...</li>
      <li>This same company is associated with an internet scam that sends you a free 30 day supply which enrolls you in a $78 auto renew.</li>
      <li>They ask you to return everything to them in its original packaging (Heaven forbid you actually tried the thing...), otherwise they will charge you $20.00 for a &amp;#34;repackaging fee&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>The gel was consistent with clear water.  </li>
      <li>The advertisement said to mix this Bella product with another product called Genuine White and a miracle would occur in your mouth, causing your teeth to become exceptionally white and bright in as little as only 3 uses of the products.  </li>
      <li>but, what the heck, you saved big bucks by doing this, right?  </li>
      <li>The lure you in with some &amp;#34;cutesie&amp;#34; testimonial from an innocent-looking teacher who makes sure that she mentions the fact that not just their product works, but it has to be used together with a strangely similar product, Blizzard White, that ends up having the same packaging and mode of LACK of customer service obviously from another country.  </li>
      <li>There was no way to keep it in the soft plastic trays.</li>
      <li>This is the only place I have been able to find to review these people,, since their corporate link has been well hidden.  </li>
      <li>You can save the $500 that you would spend at the dentist&#x27;s office and if you order now while the free trials are going on, you would only have to spend as little as $3.00 for shipping.  </li>
      <li>The mouth piece doesn&#x27;t adjust or fit all mouth sizes since everyones mouth varies between big or small.</li>
      <li>After the whole process and constantly doing this every other day I did notice my teeth get a bit whiter.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t very effective; I was extremely disappointed.  </li>

<li> I cant say whether this product would whiten ones teeth significantly with the recommended amount of use because its so cumbersome, a hassle to even attempt, and the formula is extemely irritating to the gums and tongue.</li>
<li> A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
<li> If I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to use the product I would have return it.  </li>
<li> When I put it in the trays the liquid ran out and what was left in the trays ran down the side of the trays into the back of my mouth.  </li>
<li> so I luckily &amp;#34;dodged&amp;#34; 2 out of the countless &amp;#34;bullets&amp;#34; associated with this disturbing experience.  </li>
<li> When I applied fluid to the rubber tooth cover, the fluid was unevenly distributed.</li>
<li> It does not live up to its claims.</li>
<li> The 4th time I actually spoke to an American, IN COLORADO, who gave me the same song and dance, but at least I could understand her...  </li>
<li> The fluid smells like vinegar and is very runny and difficult to apply.</li>
<li> when I received my whitening kit it contained only two tubes of whitening gel and they were not filled with gel.</li>
<li> My mouth is a small and this was rather big.</li>
<li> Not able to keep in upper and lower section of mouth piece.  </li>
<li> I was billed before the trial period was up and only received a minimal refund of 35% after I complained.</li>
<li> and you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
<li> This is suppose to be a 30 day supply which mean that you put this same thing in your mouth day in and out for 30 days, nothing to refresh each day.</li>
<li> lucked out when the charge on my account came before I decided to open the thing, and then I see the lousy reviews posted above mine...</li>
<li> (sounds like a bad TV game show...) of 75%, which you end up agreeing on after you call back a second time, because they hang up on you for this too when you refuse to accept the 75% refund the first time.  </li>
<li> What a waste of money.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll keep my slightly yellowing teeth for  now!</li>
<li> The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; in this kit were a few small plastic vials and were the consistency of water.</li>
<li> This, in the end, proves to be an expensive, useless, bogus-claiming offer...</li>
<li> Once you baulk and the outrageous offer, they offer you 65% refund and after your throw more indignant comments at them, they offer you a &amp;#34;final offer&amp;#34;</li>
<li> and I wasted $35!</li>
<li> It was a complete liquid that is impossible to apply to both sides on the tray.</li>
<li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t read the other reviews.</li>
<li> Terrible, pure liquid.</li>
<li> It was not what I expected and not as per the information provided - very disappointing.</li>
<li> their product and they &amp;#34;offer&amp;#34; you a 35% refund on the outrageous price of over $93.00 form Bella and  over $40.00 for the Blizzard White, which you incur if you do not &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; something, like cancel, within 8 days.  </li>
<li> The mouth piece was extremely uncomfortable.  </li>
<li> Something was obviously wrong with the lot I got.  </li>
<li> Liquid is very thin  </li>
<li> But the biggest problem was that the rubber tooth cover was very uncomfortable and even hurt my gums after being in place for a minute or so.</li>
<li> They are bad ones..., still I am FLOORED by the lack of comments on the way these people do business!  </li>
<li> Very disappointed with this product.  </li>
<li> Horrible I will never order again.</li>
<li> Everyone that tried this product read or saw the advertisement of the school teacher who smoked, drank coffee, wine and had yellowed her teeth because of her bad habits??!!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought this was a gel. It came as a liquid and would not even stay in the tray. I bought three and only used 2.&lt;br /&gt;No difference...and I wasted $35!</li>
    <li> The product was supposed to be for 30 days, there was only 2 tubes of the liquid in the package and each tube was for one application.  The product was supposed to be of a gel like substance but it was like water and didn&#x27;t stay in the trays at all it poured right out.  It was not what I expected and not as per the information provided - very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t read the other reviews. This product is a scam. Like many others the gel that you are suppose to inject into a bit tray is liquid not a gel so it simply runs out. This is suppose to be a 30 day supply which mean that you put this same thing in your mouth day in and out for 30 days, nothing to refresh each day. This same company is associated with an internet scam that sends you a free 30 day supply which enrolls you in a $78 auto renew. Your investment in any toothpaste will be better than spending on this product.</li>
    <li> Okay in the package you get two plastic tubes with the \\&quot;gel\\&quot; in it, a mouth piece, mouth piece case, and a strip of paper to see the wonderful shades of teeth from yellow straight up to the brightest of white. The plastic tubes contain the whitening \\&quot;gel\\&quot; but to me it isn&#x27;t gel its more of liquid than a gel. The mouth piece doesn&#x27;t adjust or fit all mouth sizes since everyones mouth varies between big or small. My mouth is a small and this was rather big. On the mouth guard is three holes in the front so you can breathe and it has the top and bottom part attached together so when you apply the \\&quot;gel\\&quot; it literally runs all over. The first time I applied it my floor got more of the product than the guard did. Then once the guard has the gel on it you leave it for about an hour. While its in your mouth you can&#x27;t swallow so constantly you are pushing saliva out of the three holes in the front, your pretty much just drooling all over so be sure to have a towel on hand. After the whole process and constantly doing this every other day I did notice my teeth get a bit whiter. In the end I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews for this product, I thought to myself what a bargain.  I generally spend so much on teeth whitening products that I was happy to find one so reasonable and would work (based on the reviews).  If I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to use the product I would have return it.  The gel was consistent with clear water.  When I put it in the trays the liquid ran out and what was left in the trays ran down the side of the trays into the back of my mouth.  Maybe the product had expired, I didn&#x27;t check.  If you purchase the product make sure to check the expiration date and use right away.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> Perhaps I was just unlucky but the applicators were filled with a liquid instead of a gel.  I was foolish enough to try it anyway and I couldn&#x27;t even keep the liquid in the top tray.  I ended up using the rest of the contents of the first applicator by applying it to my teeth with a q-tip and using the trays to keep the liquid away from the rest of my mouth.  It wasn&#x27;t very effective; I was extremely disappointed.  Something was obviously wrong with the lot I got.  I&#x27;m considering writing to the company.  Something happened to their quality control and I&#x27;m sure they would want to know about it.</li>
    <li> People, pay attention to the reviews!  They are bad ones..., still I am FLOORED by the lack of comments on the way these people do business!  The lure you in with some &amp;#34;cutesie&amp;#34; testimonial from an innocent-looking teacher who makes sure that she mentions the fact that not just their product works, but it has to be used together with a strangely similar product, Blizzard White, that ends up having the same packaging and mode of LACK of customer service obviously from another country.  I asked 4 times to speak to someone in the U.S. and 2 out of the 4 told me they were in the U.S.  When I asked where in the U. S., they said Colorado.  I asked where in Colorado, they both said &#x27; in the city&amp;#34;, obviously scripted!  I couldn&#x27;t stop laughing!  I didn&#x27;t know Colorado had changed its &amp;#34;native language&amp;#34;...  The 3rd time the guy said, that if I didn&#x27;t want to &amp;#34;talk&amp;#34; to him, he would &amp;#34;disconnect the call&amp;#34;.  When I insisted, he did...  The 4th time I actually spoke to an American, IN COLORADO, who gave me the same song and dance, but at least I could understand her...  These people not only outsource their customer service, but they lie and hang up on you when you ask them to speak to someone in the United States.  And, that&#x27;s not all...  you pay under $4.00 to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; their product and they &amp;#34;offer&amp;#34; you a 35% refund on the outrageous price of over $93.00 form Bella and  over $40.00 for the Blizzard White, which you incur if you do not &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; something, like cancel, within 8 days.  This, of course, not made clear to you except at the very bottom of the original email in the smallest of print.  It is not to be found on the confirmation receipt you print out, foolishly thinking this will protect you, nor is it made clear on the original body of the original email, except for the tiny print at the bottom.  Once you baulk and the outrageous offer, they offer you 65% refund and after your throw more indignant comments at them, they offer you a &amp;#34;final offer&amp;#34; (sounds like a bad TV game show...) of 75%, which you end up agreeing on after you call back a second time, because they hang up on you for this too when you refuse to accept the 75% refund the first time.  They ask you to return everything to them in its original packaging (Heaven forbid you actually tried the thing...), otherwise they will charge you $20.00 for a &amp;#34;repackaging fee&amp;#34;.  LIKE THEY COULD ACTUALLY REPACKAGE SOMETHING YOU HAVE ALREADY USED IN YOUR MOUTH!&lt;br /&gt;I lucked out when the charge on my account came before I decided to open the thing, and then I see the lousy reviews posted above mine...should this ever make in to be published..., so I luckily &amp;#34;dodged&amp;#34; 2 out of the countless &amp;#34;bullets&amp;#34; associated with this disturbing experience.  This is the only place I have been able to find to review these people,, since their corporate link has been well hidden.  This, in the end, proves to be an expensive, useless, bogus-claiming offer... It obviously doesn&#x27;t even come close to what they claim it can do!  I&#x27;ll keep my slightly yellowing teeth for  now!</li>
    <li> I received this in a short matter of time after ordering. I only used it twice in the 8 months I&#x27;ve had it because what I received was a liquid, not a gel. the liquid doesnt stay in the tray which means no matter what it comes in contact with my gums, and forget about attempting to use this to whiten your bottom teeth. I cant say whether this product would whiten ones teeth significantly with the recommended amount of use because its so cumbersome, a hassle to even attempt, and the formula is extemely irritating to the gums and tongue.</li>
    <li> I made the online-ordering #1 mistake and didn&#x27;t read the reviews prior to purchasing this product. It was exactly as described... when I received my whitening kit it contained only two tubes of whitening gel and they were not filled with gel. It was a complete liquid that is impossible to apply to both sides on the tray. Would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> The Bella Labs teeth whitening system arrived without any instructions. When I applied fluid to the rubber tooth cover, the fluid was unevenly distributed. But the biggest problem was that the rubber tooth cover was very uncomfortable and even hurt my gums after being in place for a minute or so. I do NOT recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love to try a tooth whitening system that works, is comfortable and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> It claims to be a gel, but it&#x27;s really just some liquid substance that doesn&#x27;t bond to your teeth or the mouth piece... A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
    <li> Terrible, pure liquid. DOES NOT stay in trays.</li>
    <li> Did not work, no explanation how to use.</li>
    <li> The teeth tray was bulky and I could not breath when I was using it. Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in teeth color, either.</li>
    <li> Horrible I will never order again. Watery solution</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t even gel, it was liquid don&#x27;t buy!!!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product.  The gel was runny and almost like a liquid.  Not able to keep in upper and lower section of mouth piece.  The mouth piece was extremely uncomfortable.  Threw it away!</li>
    <li> Do not order!  I wish Amazon would not even sell this product.  I feel this is a scam.  It does not live up to its claims. I was billed before the trial period was up and only received a minimal refund of 35% after I complained. The product is a runny liquid and not a gel. It dos not work. Please do not get mixed up with these people or this product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe Amazon is still allowing this to be sold on their site. LOOK at the REVIEWS.&lt;br /&gt;READ the reviews. READ all of them READ and you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s not worth it. READ the reviews again.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; in this kit were a few small plastic vials and were the consistency of water. There was no way to keep it in the soft plastic trays. It just spills out when you put it in your mouth, and does nothing for your teeth. I recommend that Amazon stop selling this ripoff product to the public. Products like this make me wonder about everything else that Amazon sells.</li>
    <li> Let me guess.  Everyone that tried this product read or saw the advertisement of the school teacher who smoked, drank coffee, wine and had yellowed her teeth because of her bad habits??!!  The advertisement said to mix this Bella product with another product called Genuine White and a miracle would occur in your mouth, causing your teeth to become exceptionally white and bright in as little as only 3 uses of the products.  You can save the $500 that you would spend at the dentist&#x27;s office and if you order now while the free trials are going on, you would only have to spend as little as $3.00 for shipping.  But of course, they now have your email address, your mailing address, your name AND your credit card information.....  but, what the heck, you saved big bucks by doing this, right?  P.T Barnum had it right when he said, &amp;#34;There&#x27;s a sucker born every second&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> When I got the product it wasn&#x27;t even gel. I couldn&#x27;t use it. It was basically just water. I had to throw it away. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> The fluid smells like vinegar and is very runny and difficult to apply.</li>
    <li> Liquid is very thin  didn&#x27;t stay in the top tray</li>
</ol>
